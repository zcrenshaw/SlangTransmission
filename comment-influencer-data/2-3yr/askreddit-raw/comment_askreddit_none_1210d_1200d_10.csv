0,"I dropped my pants when going through TSA....For those who fly in the super early morning it can be rough. I purposely didn't drink coffee so I could sleep on the plane...

I was on the security line, and did the normal routine of taking stuff out of my pockets and putting them in my laptop bag. Then off with the shoes, placed on top of my luggage, then off comes the belt as usual. Then of course when you take off your belt you take off your pants.....uhhh Nope damnit. Put them back on and WTFed for a moment as I finished up in security. Luckily not *that many* people fly at like 430am.

But still, my first thought wasn't, whoops, I failed at mailing this check. Instead it was, well I guess this stamp is old, and the price of stamps went up. So I put another stamp on it and sent it again, to myself, again. My mailman must think I'm retarded. "

Normally, I'd go up and ask them to be respectful, and was about to, until... I noticed that one of the step patterns was way too short. They've got an infant who is just learning to walk and they're playing with it, chasing it around the apartment and playing. I sometimes hear squeals of joy from the kid.

25,"I used to sit and eat my lunch alone in a bathroom stall every day during jr high school (1999-2002). I had major insecurity issues and thought no one wanted to eat lunch with me. To this day whenever I eat the type of sandwiches I ate then, I can smell the school bathroom.

I used to sit in there and then hide whenever someone came in. I didn't even read, I would just sit there worried that someone would see me. I memorized every detail of that stall. I could probably recreate it in detail 14 years later.

Every day my mother would make my lunch for me to take to school, and she had no idea that I was eating it all alone in an empty bathroom.

The worst part is that no one ever asked where I went during lunch, feeding into my insecurity that no one missed me.

I've never told a soul, not even my wife.

41,"We used to have a cockatoo, as well as some cats and dogs.

We were teaching the dogs some tricks, and the cockatoo was just doing his bird thing. Every day, the same routine: get some treats, call the dogs, sit, stay, lay down, roll over, get a treat, etc.

One night we were watching TV and hear the cockatoo call the dog by name.
""Sit. Stay. Lay down. Roll over. Good Boy"". We heard something hit the floor, and then he called out the next dog's name.

Walked into the kitchen to find the cockatoo in the spot we always stand, giving orders to the dogs (who were obeying!), and then pulling treats out of the cup and dropping them on the floor. This went on for some time.

Dogs now liked the cockatoo, and would let him ride on their backs. Cockatoo would call them, tell them to lay down, would climb on, and ride around like a king.

The dogs knew what's up, would walk to the kitchen, and stand by the counter. Cockatoo would hop up and drop them a treat, say ""good boy"", and hop back on.

45,"For most of the time it's a bit like having a sensitive ball of flesh attached to your front. Think of having a small boob in your crotch area. You can feel it's there most of the time, but it's not something you think about. When it's flabbing about freely it feels more... complex. What is usually restrained in your pants is now like a boob octopus that will flail around if you move too fast. I'm pretty sure the first piece of clothing we invented was the loincloth to help us run and move without fearing that the dick would slam into our balls. 
That said, its hardly ever in the way. Just like the vagina is lower than most guys expect, the dick is upper than most girls expect.

Now, when the dick decides it's going to fuck something, never mind the social or physical situation you are in, it gets a mind of its own. You can trick it, but you can't control it. In fact, it controls you. Lets continue with the boob analogy. Tighten your thighs and feel them. Do you feel the muscles, how hard they are? Imagine if the fleshy glob of fat that is your immaculate boobs suddenly turns into that. And your nipples become oh so sensitive and large. And then imagine those boobs in the shape of a dick in your crotch. In your pants. At your grandma's house. Where you are hosting a wake for you grandma. And you are delivering a speech in front of your family. You feel embarrassed, not horny. But your stupid stupid dick saw all those crying women in front of you and decided that, yeah, this is a worthwhile fetish. So now you are hoping to god that the creases in your pants are hiding your dick.

Let's take this analogy further, we're all pretty uncomfortable by now. Lets imagine this muscle boob with sensitive nipples in the shape of a dick and yourself have managed to coax a female of your species into copulating. God knows how you did that, your genitals sound more monstrous by the minute. 
But here you are, you're both naked, she's conveniently naked and ready, and you are sporting what you hope is at least an average dick. You're not gonna win any awards but whatever.

Your penis is now in charge. And it wants one thing. To be inside that other person. And it will not stop until it is there. Nirvana awaits, why the hell aren't you inside that person!?
Okay so now you are inside that person and it feels amazing, tight, wet, so varm and just all around great. Except  your penis still isn't happy. It demands stimulation. 

Female and male orgasm are very different, obviously.  Sure we have the same nerve endings and whatnot but most women can attest to that they don't orgasm every time, and sometimes it's fine not to orgasm(insert jokes about small dicks, inferior men and insults to selfish men here). To the dick, not orgasming is not acceptable. It's like the terminator, it must complete it's mission. There is no enjoying the ""journey"" for the dick. The dick is on a one way track to orgasmville, population 100 million kids. The dick doesn't care if anyone else joins him on the way to the orgasmville, if they do, that's a bonus. 

Your selfish boobmuscle is getting most of the simulation from it's nipple. That's basically the only spot and the key is making that spot happy. When you find the right rhythm you start to feel a strange burning situation in the taint. This is called the vinegar burns and indicate that you are going to come. You will ejaculate now, there's nothing anyone can do to stop that. Once you've reached this point it's kind of like being able to chose a rollercoaster. You can pump away and reach some kind of nirvana esque experience as you feel yourself drain away into the other person through your boobmusclenipple. You can also ejaculate without orgasming, which is just a waste of time and effort. But the vinegar burns tell you that the journey is almost over and your penis and yourself are very happy.

At that point your dick sort of dies. It'll stay hard for  a while but it's powerless to control you. And its that moment, right after sex, as you're getting your breath back, you begin to understand how this retarded muscle hanging in front of you controls every aspect of your life. How everything you do is an extension of his need to be inside other people. It feels comical. It feels insane. You start to wonder if you wanted to go to college or if your dick just wanted to try out other people's bodies, you begin to question your life choices, you start to wonder how every single man is driven by their dicks and how the entire male world is just a relentless race to find people to share their strange muscles with.

And then your dick starts waking up again and begins preparing for your next excursion.

And that's what's having a dick is like.

He went over to see his friend, but when he was offered lunch, which was pork chops and mashed potatoes, he declined and made up that something was wrong with his mouth so he couldn't eat (I think he said either wisdom teeth or a root canal). The fiancé felt bad that they'd be eating in front of my dad and didn't want him to be hungry...so she put the pork chops and mashed potatoes into a blender for him.

My dad said he drank it because he didn't know what else to do, he didn't want to admit he lied and he didn't want to hurt her feelings. He said he nearly vomited with every sip and as of today it's still been the worst thing he's ever eaten/drank.

After about a week of this, a stranger showed up at my house and took me into the living room alone. She showed me a girl and boy doll and started asking me really weird questions about private parts and touching. I was 100% confused. 

Turns out I had crabs. Since they typically live in pubic hair and I didn't have any, they decided to live in my eyelashes. My mom thought I'd been molested. In reality, the babysitter had banged her boyfriend on a couch (at a different house) that I then took a nap on. 

I want to add that I didn't know the truth until I was about 25. My niece got lice and I was surprised they weren't in her eyelashes. My mother told me what had really happened and I'm still mortified.

With that as the topic of conversation, this is genuinely a discussion I had with someone when we were 14.

Me: ""The Simpsons made a joke about that during (episode about the 4th of July I forget the name of)""

Friend: ""Yeah I watched that one. The British sound like dicks""

Me: *slow blink* ""Come again?""

Friend: ""You know, the British. The guys they always talk about when they do that kinda specials. I bet we could take them.""

Me: ""... Daniel, what country do we live in?""

Friend: ""England""

Cue very quick explanation of British geography, with Daniel refusing to believe he was British until he went home and asked his mum.

120,"Did you know The PowerPuff Girls had a fourth sister?


In one episode, The PowerPuff Girls were feeling overworked, so they decided to manufacture themselves a fourth sister in the professor's lab. But they used some different ingredients, so the fourth sister came out massive, mentally disabled, and pretty ugly. They playfully named her ""Bunny"", and send her off to fight crime for them.

Well, Bunny misunderstands what they are asking of her, and throws the police in jail, and frees all the criminals. The PowerPuff Girls get angry at her, call her ""bad"" and send her away, only to be confronted by all of the criminals that Bunny had released. They promptly get their asses kicked. Bunny hears their cries and realizes what she has done, and beats up all of the criminals, saving her sisters, saying ""Bunny do good!"". However, they didn't make her atomically stable, so she explodes in a big flash of light, returning to her original ingredients. The episode ends with the girls holding a piece of her dress and they realize that she was good, and it was them who were bad. The narrator weeps and says ""For the first and final time, the day was saved...thanks to PowerPuff Bunny.""

It was more or less like my sis and I were on our own out there, because the children there didn't get much adult attention. It was like Lord of the Flies. My Dad visited me for my 9th birthday and he gave me a locket with his picture in it, wearing a hat I gave him. I cried, it was the perfect gift, and the moment I realized I was really taking care of myself when he wasn't there.

I was 9, and I didn't want toys. All I wanted was my dad, and I was so happy just to settle for a tiny picture of him instead. To this day I think of that as the moment I lost my childhood. I lost the locket in some move or other. What I wouldn't give to have it back...

EDIT: hey all, holy shit i am so sorry i made so many of you cry, was not my intention. And you all had great ideas, I will totally tell my dad about it, though I'm worried he will cry too... a lot of you are asking for details, so here they are:

Custody: There was never a custody battle over my sis and I, my parents remained friends after the divorce so they didn't go to court. My dad worked full time and I was homeschooled (I dropped out of any school they put me in after panic attacks/bullying/mental breakdowns), so I went with my mom.

Comunes: there are a few comunes across the country (USA). They started in the 60s and were really lively places where hardworking hippies went to create healthy, eco-sustainable communities. Now, these places are mostly full of 60-something layabouts, 20 something stoners and druggies (with kids), and about 1 or 2 harworking hippies trying to create healthy, eco sustainable communities.

My dear mother: she has major depression, anxiety, and narcissism up the wazoo. Aside from all that she's actually really cool. A great friend, funny, smart, but a horrible mother. She genuinely took us there because she wanted to go, and convinced herself that thus it would be best for us too. My dad really had no idea how bad she was, i dont think, probs denied it to himself too tbh. After the divorce she expected me to more or less take care of her emotionally. Days of refusing to leave her room, random shouting and blaming me for things I had no control over, whole nine yards.

Where is my mom now: she lives on a farm of her own. I see her occasionally, and she resents that we are no longer close, despite having kicked me out for trying to be myself, threatening to kill herself (she won't, just tryin to pull my strings). For a long time i didn't realize what she was and did try to take care of her. After that I was done. She tried her best, she really did, but depression and anxiety are like demons that possessed her. I have my own life to live.

And thanks for the gold, kind stranger!"

230,"I'm a pretty sentimental guy. I had saved every sweet voicemail my wife left me from when we started dating to when we got married. Only the best. The ones that helped in hard times or celebrated milestones in my life. In the process of recording them on my computer they were accidentally deleted and my computer crashed while recording them. I sobbed maybe. My long term memory isn't great and those helped me remember the early days with such clarity. 

But the up side is that we've made lots of new memories and she makes a point to help me remember details that I jumble up. It's helped grow our relationship. Still wish I could hear the voicemail from after our first date though. 

Edit: Added up side. 

Edit 2: WOAH! Never expected this! So many kind and helpful responses that I don't have time to read them all right now. A few have pointed out that I probably could have recovered the audio file I was recording. I had made some attempts but it was the limit of my knowledge at the time. This July we will be married six years so it happened close to that time. The HDD is long gone and saw much use after that anyway. I've moved on and am more careful about some of this stuff. We still have pictures, poems, love notes, and cards. Our two year old sleeps alongside the stuffed animal that I gave my wife after a fight about when we were going to talk about marriage.

231,"My mother got mad at me once and to punish me, she took my cat over to her brother in law's and told him that it had feline leukemia, would die a slow painful death and she couldn't afford the euthanasia. 

He shot the cat. 

The cat was healthy. 

I found out the truth two weeks later, when the vet sent the test result to my dad's house (I was listed as the owner and the cat was perfectly healthy). 

I made the mistake of telling my uncle the truth and he cried like a baby. 

I ended up losing my cat *and* feeling like crap for telling people the truth of what my mother did. 

I feel your pain. Children of crazy mother unite?

Edit 1: typo

Edit 2: My mother is indeed mentally ill. She has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, narcissistic personality disorder and OCD (with severe hoarding tendencies). Oh and paranoia, but I *think* that is related to one of the others. 

My uncle was even more of a victim than me. I feel bad about the way I told him, but I was only about 12 at the time. When we confronted my mother, she claimed that the cat had taken a fit and she thought it was dying. There was much crying and apologizing and everyone felt bad for her. 

My mother is **very** good at manipulation. 

And for the record, this wasn't even the *most* fucked up thing she ever did to me. 

Edit 3: You guys are weird, but okay here's my most fucked up mother story:

She has OCD and is *really* bad to pick at scabs, blackheads, etc until she's created an ulcer sore, usually the size of a quarter. But she's also really vain (of course). 

So, shortly after my parents separated (I was 9 or so), I spent two weeks with her. The second night, she was really pissy (bipolar episode I guess, her manics were not euphoric, she would be extremely bitchy during them). She suddenly grabs me by the chin, examines my face and says something like ""we can't have that"" 

She brings me to the couch and has me lay down with my head on her lap. She has a little cosmetic bag that she keeps, I refer to it as her face picking bag. It has, among other things, bobby pins. 

She starts trying to get blackheads off my face with the bobby pins. I'm pretty sure that I didn't actually have any, but she's going to town. And she's pressing harder and harder, until she eventually scrapes skin off and I cry. 

But she's calm. She shushes me, rubs my hair and starts singing to me. This is the fucked up part. She was never ""motherly"" to me. And I was so desperate for some sign of love from her, that I laid there quietly while she dug holes in my face with bobby pins and sang to me, for hours. 

I still remember the weird mixture of pain from the bobby pins and peace from her comforting me. 

I still have scars on my face from it, that most people assume are acne scars. That was thirty years ago. 

By the time anyone else saw me, they were healing and she told everyone that I'd gotten poison ivy.

Edit: WWII fighter pilots were known to have key parties before deployment, and it wasn't uncommon for a returning pilot to look after a buddy who didn't make it back's wife. They also had a taste for amphetamines and danger which lead to the first outlaw biker gangs. Power boat racing was revolutionized by all the cheap surplus fighter engines which were repurposed to push racing boats.

If there's a 1 in a million chance of winning the lottery and you buy a million (random) lottery tickets, you have a 63% chance of winning.

Edit: for the lottery example, the key word is **random** - yeah if you consciously buy every possible combination then it's 100%. If you buy one ticket in a million different lotteries, or a million randomly generated tickets for any one in a million lottery, then it's 63%"

269,"Sweet peas my wife cooked. 

She used a pot that apparently still had dishwashing soap residue on it from a new brand of soap she was trying. Apparently that particular brand has a thicker soap than others and didn't rinse off completely. 
Her father was over and she made his favorite meal as a surprise. Ranch spiced pork chops, buttered croissant rolls, sweet peas and garlic mashed potatoes. He and I sat down and starting eating and both noticed that the peas tasted...uh...soapy. We looked at each other as if in recognition (of the taste) and agreement (to not say a word). These peas tasted awful, but my wife can be very emotional and we weren't going to say a thing.

My wife finished making our daughters plate, then her own and finally sat down to eat.  She got probably 2 bites into the peas, said they tasted like dish soap and then asked us what we thought. We agreed with her, eyes down like scolded school children and she proceeded to ask why the fuck we were still eating them if they tasted like that. Then we felt scolded even more, on top of our blatant ignorance in her eyes.  Even our daughter started to eat them, not wanting to mention the taste because mommy had been working so hard on that meal for all of us. 

The peas went in the trash, and we finished the meal. Her father burst out laughing at her reaction. 
Still to this day, when my wife tells our daughter that we are having sweet peas, she asks if they are the soapy kind or regular.

Edit : Basically, in my mind my wife had never, and I do mean never, cooked a bad meal. She had been working so hard to make a great meal for her fathers visit, and for me by extension. What right did I have to spoil that for her? That was my reasoning. "

271,"[Hairy Ball Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairy_ball_theorem): The hairy ball theorem of algebraic topology states that there is no nonvanishing continuous tangent vector field on even-dimensional n-spheres.

English: It's impossible to comb all the hairs on a tennis ball in the same direction without creating a cowlick.

Edit: found a funny version : 
&gt;The hairy ball theorem of topology states that, whenever one tries to comb a hairy ball flat, one always misses a spot. Topologists, who can never say anything that simply, put it this way: ""For every 2‑sphere, if f assigns a vector in R³ to every point p such that f(p) is always tangent at p, then it is a bit surprising that the girl blinded me with Science!""

&gt;That topologists use such gassy English is an indication why they are not able to comb a hairy ball, either. They refer to the missing spot as a tuft, a cowlick, or The Latest Rage. The latter is a way of claiming they missed the spot on purpose. Yeah, sure.

During a similar earthquake my girlfriend who is a light sleeper woke up pretty much as soon as the shaking started and yelled as fast as she could say ""HEY WAKE UP! THERE'S AN EARTH QUAKE! WHAT DO WE DO!"" I heard everything she said but I'm a pretty heavy sleeper so in my panic and drowsiness all I could think was to say ""stop drop and roll!"" (I guess my half asleep mind remembered that from elementary school when they teach us what to do if you're ever on fire). 

Of course I don't do it as I'm still trying to wake up and gain motor functions, but my girlfriend in her panic and probably semi drowsiness rolls off the bed and literally ""stops, drops, and rolls"" on our bedroom floor until she's fully awake (a few seconds after the earthquake stopped) then she proceeds to yell at me for playing a prank on her while she was half asleep and scared. By this point I'm still in bed and can't move due to the laughter at watching her do it. I didn't actually want or try to prank her, it was just the only thing my brain thought to say, but to this day she thinks I did it to fuck with her.

Anyway, Dad gets home from work late, and Mom is making dinner. This dinner is going to be the one thing that she gets right today. This dinner is going to be her lifeline to not have a nervous breakdown.

It's quiche. My mother, a fantastic cook, has never made quiche, but was determined to **succeed** at something this hellish day.

We set the table, and she brings the dish out, hands nearly shaking, disheveled, on the verge of tears, and says, ""Here we go!""

Imagine a sponge, slightly moist, with a hint of cheese and limp vegetables. That was this quiche; it was...terrible.

We all knew it, all 5 sons and dad. However, mom has never made food that wasn't great, and we knew it wasn't her fault, so we're happy to choke it down.

We finish and quickly as possible, and loudly proclaim, ""Mmmmmm, that was great, Mom! Thank you!""

Knowing we're not boys to leave food on the table, she happily says, ""Oh, get some more!""

I'm the oldest, and in that moment my father and I made contact, and even though I was only 12, there was an understanding, a moment of clarity between us.

He scooped up our plates and said, ""Eat up, boys!"" And led the charge.

Not one piece of quiche was left. Partly because of our need to help mom, and partly because we couldn't imagine it being leftover for the next day.

Sometimes, with no words spoken, eating the bad really is the best option."

--------------------------------------------
Edit: Happy that this comment has spawned a lot of conversation! Many people have been writing asking for tips and suggestions. For the lazy, i'll highlight a few of what people have written and my other comment here. Sorry in advanced for the new length.

(1) [Toastmasters](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4k1voo/whats_a_skill_youve_learned_that_has_improved/d3bnjxn) ($72 per year) /r/Toastmasters 

(2) First step is to recognize what a filler word is. // Second step is thinking before your speak. // Third Step is to practice 

[TL;DR Just remember that the biggest way to gain confidence in public speaking is going out infront of people and presenting. Giving powerpoint presentations in classes, speeches at pep rallies etc will strengthen your confidence, and your speech.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4k1voo/whats_a_skill_youve_learned_that_has_improved/d3bm1ws)

(3) 1st step to overcoming this is to replace the pause sounds you nervously make with silence. It appears that you are thinking instead of buying time. After you master the silent skill, you can move onto better skills.

(4) Read ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" by Dale Carnegie.

(5) [here's a link to a TED talk by Julian Treasure] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIho2S0ZahI) he's a public speaking expert and all-round top bloke

(6) To piggyback this advice, in the stead of using words that pause your train of thought, actually take that pause. Omit saying ""umm"", make eye contact(s), take a deep breath, articulate your next sentence, and go forward. Instead of being quick to respond, give a lingering moment of expectation from your audience. Such a skill is priceless when you allow others to think on your words, because they fill in the gaps with their own words while you reorganize yours.

(7) [what not to do] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTQrOIbbrhM). 

(8) I highly highly highly recommend seeing if your school has a mock trial club / speech &amp; debate, forensics, model UN, JSA, DECA, etc

(9) LPT: If you just can't get your speech fluent and you must pause to think, DO NOT use fillers. Just keep silent. Watch how politicians talk on TV for a better idea.

(10) There's a simple methodology for removing verbalized pauses, and that is to replace them with non-verbalized pauses. As you speak &lt;deliberate pause&gt;, take whatever time you need &lt;deliberate pause&gt;, to think of what you're going to say next. When you first try it, it will feel a bit unnatural, but you can use it to fix this problem. I learned this in a public speaking class, and I need to get better at it myself.
Incidentally, these verbal pauses are natural because they signal to the listener that you have more to say and are thinking through your articulation. They are just unnecessary in a public speaking situation where you have the floor.

(11) You know what helps me? Slow down your speech. Really hear the words coming out of your mouth, and think of what to say next. By slowing yourself down, you give yourself that extra time, and people can understand you better since you aren't rushing through sentences.
I recently had to do many public speaking or videotaping exercises which helps a lot. If you have a Webcam, just write a page long script for yourself, and record it. Then listen to it, see where you spoke to fast, were hard to understand, or just messed up. Then do it again, focusing on slowing down and giving the viewer and yourself enough time to think about what you just said.
It's not the easiest thing in the world, I know, but slowing down my own speech has helped me greatly."

446,"Well, I'll contribute a story, instead of an answer. We play ""What's your number?"" at the house pretty often. How much is enough to do `X`? Always consists of a weird or fucked up situation, but never anything illegal or permanent. 

Last night, we were deciding how much it would cost to get one of us to eat a can of cat food. Everyone started with ""Oh, not less than $100,000"" or some shit. But then someone asks ""Really? Someone had half that in their hand, and you wouldn't take them up on that?"" 

And the number *always* goes down. By halves. ***Quickly***.

And we get down to ""**G**"" bidding that he'll do it for $85, and Sarah bidding she'll do it for $75, G says he'll do it for $70, but Sarah offers $65 AND I get to record it. G gives up.

Sarah got half a bite in before giving up, but I gave her $20 because she just ate cat food ffs.

So G offers to eat 3 bites for $55, and I counter-offer $20 for the first bite swallowed, $15 for every subsequent bite swallowed.

He made $65 before he started vomiting.

The moral of the story:

449,"During World War II, the Japanese outfitted special planes (some were designed to be launched from submarines) with enough range to reach the west coast of the United States. The goal was to use incendiary bombs to start wildfires in the forests of the pacific northwest. One pilot, [Nobuo Fujita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobuo_Fujita), successfully dropped his bombs over the forest near Brookings, Oregon. Fortunately, a storm the night before had dampened the forest, and the fire started by Fujita's bomb was quickly controlled by the Forest Service. 

Eighteen years later, in 1962, Fujita returned to Brookings. He brought with him his family's heirloom, a *katana* that was over 400 years old. Fujita apologized to the townspeople for his actions during the war, and revealed that if the townspeople demanded it, he would ceremoniously kill himself (commit *seppuku*) with the sword to make reparations for his actions. 

The townspeople would have none of it. Fujita was made an honorary citizen of the town and returned to visit it several times during his life, including one trip to plant trees in the forest he had bombed decades before. After his death in 1997, his daughter returned to Brookings and scattered some of his ashes there. The Fujita family katana is on display in Brookings, after being given to the town by Fujita as a token of friendship."

452,"If the moon was only 26 miles up it would have to orbit around the Earth REEEAALLY quickly. I'll do some quick math on it and get back to you about what the effects of that would be.

EDIT: The moon would orbit the earth a little more than once every two hours. In addition, the force of gravity from the moon on a 1 kg object on the surface of the Earth is 1.55 Newtons when the moon is at its highest point on the sky, and when it is on the other side of the Earth it's force of gravity on that same object is 0.023 Newtons. The force of gravity from the Earth itself is 9.81 Newtons, so I hope you like having the force of gravity wobble between 101% and 84% of what it is now every 2 hours."

Too easy for George! There's no way that a free meal among friends was going to work out but I just couldn't stay away. That's my fatal flaw, Jerry. When something's too good to be true, I can't say no! 

Jerry: You just can't control yourself, can you? You're out of control, George. You need to rein yourself in. 

George: I tried. I really did. When she brought out the food I told her that I had just had a root canal done and that it probably wasn't a good idea to eat solid food like pork chops or even potatoes because, you know, I might get an infection or something.

Jerry: Right, right, an infection, go on.

George: Well, she wasn't having that. She wasn't having that I wasn't having what she and her husband were having! She insisted! And do you know what she insisted? Do ya know what she had me do? 

*Jerry shrugs up shoulders and puts arms and palms up by sides*

George: She had me drink that meal through a straw, Jerry. She took it, put it in a blender, blended it all up like ice cream, and then had me drink it through a straw in a glass. 

Jerry: You're kidding?

George: No, no I'm not kidding. I tried to stop it. I really did. I tried to excuse myself to the bathroom where there was a window because, you know, it's on the first floor and I figured that was my only way to get out of there. She told me she had just cleaned the place and that there were chemical fumes lingering and swirling around in there and that I would get sick from them. She said I could use the upstairs bathroom instead. I declined, Jerry. I declined. 

Jerry: Is today the day when we all clean our bathrooms or something? Because if it is, no one told me. I just happen to clean my bathroom every Thursday. It's tradition, really.

George: No. No one told me. So I had to sit there and drink that meat and potatoes monstrosity while they stared at me like I was the specimen that they were performing some horrible science experiment on. It was horrible. Just horrible. And the meat milkshake? I almost threw it up. But I kept it down, Jerry. I KEPT IT WAY DOWN!

Jerry: What else could you do!? You were out of control! They were in control! Never be out of control in another couple's home! Once you're there, *you're there!* And there's no going back!

George: I didn't even bother waiting for dessert. For all I know, it would have been chocolate mousse served with a moose's hoof! I couldn't do it!

Jerry: My God. All that for a free meal among friends? You see, this is why I don't go anywhere with couples. Blowing off a male friend? No big deal. They get over it, they understand, they reschedule for another time. Men learn to roll with those punches and not take it personally. But when you get the women involved *and* the men together, there's no getting out of it! You can't say no to a couple! It's 2 against 1! You're outnumbered! If you break one tackle, the other one's there to sack you! It's too much, George. It's too much!

George: I ran out of there like I was Jim Brown. I made a run for it! I came right here. I couldn't think of anywhere else to go. I'm just hoping the meal stays down. I can't bear to see it or smell it again. I just can't do it.

*Door swings open, smacks against the wall as Kramer enters*

Kramer: Heyyyy.

Jerry: Hey Kramer. George is having a rough time right now. His lunch with Bob and Sharon went sideways and now he's trying to keep it down, with some success. 

Kramer: Oh. That's not good. You know what, I had some Pepto bismol in my apartment but I used it all up last week. The one time I forget to rotate my leftovers and mark the dates on them in the fridge is when I go to town on some leftover Kung Pao chicken. Imagine that! The one time! I was down for the count, Jerry. I was down and out! Kung Pow is what I got right to the mid-section! 

George: Oh. Oh, no. I'm gonna be sick. I gotta use the bathroom.

Jerry: No! Not my bathroom! I spent all day cleaning the place and I don't need it desecrated by Sharon's cooking!

George: Kramer! Kramer I need your keys! I need your bathroom! I NEED IT NOW!

Kramer: Hey, HEY! Not today, pal. I just cleaned the place like everybody else today. Don't you know what day it is? 

George: NO! NO I DON'T KNOW WHAT DAY IT IS! I DON'T CARE WHAT DAY IT IS!

*George runs out of the apartment and goes yelling down the hallway and then down the stairs*

Kramer: He's out of control, Jerry. He's out of control!

Jerry: I know, I told him. Some people just don't wanna listen. Everything is their way or the highway.

Three minutes later in storms this lady with two wine glasses in her hand. ""Look at this"" she says and somewhat slams the glasses onto the bar. I am a little in shock that the glasses didn't break and did as told, I looked at the glasses. ""Yes... one Chardonay with ice, one without. What's the matter, Ma'am?"" I ask. ""Why did she get more wine?!"" she asks annoyed. ""More wine?"" I ask. ""There's not more in either one. Both have 120ml exactly, right as it's supposed to be. Would you like some ice too?"". ""But THAT one is fuller!"" and she points at the one with ice. ""Yes, it has ice in it."" I reply. ""Why does she get more wine with the ice? Why don't I get more wine?! Look, this one has *that* much more wine!"" showing the diffrence between the glasses by pinching her fingers.

Well, you get where this is going. The lady didn't understand that if you fill two glasses of wine and add ice into one, the ice will make it look like its fuller, but that's just because the ice takes up space. I had to litteraly show her that it was just the ice making it LOOK like the glass is fuller (which it ofcourse was, but not with more wine).

In our flock of maybe ten bantams, there was one elderly, respected hen.

She was mother and grandmother to many of them, and you could tell how much they esteemed her.

One morning, I open the chicken coop as usual, but not a chook was to be seen. Normally they'd be all running out to find the night's bounty of bugs, but not this morning. I walk inside the pen to see what's up.

There is a circle of chickens. An actual circle, with Grey Girl's body right in the middle. All the chooks are making this weird wailing sound, which I had never heard before. I am in no doubt they were mourning the passing of their elder mother.

What's more, the body was lying outside the shed where she would have been roosting. There is a good chance that she was actually pulled out of the claustrophobic, poo-filled shed and placed in the open space by the chickens, so they could pay their respects.

After about half an hour the chooks all wandered off and I buried the body. And I never saw that behaviour again.

I reached under the pillow and I found this weird long pink thing. I found a button on the top of it and it started vibrating. ""Hey look, this thing vibrates!"" I told my brother. Being kids, we just rubbed it all over ourselves and such to feel the vibrations, including putting it out mouths. And yes, I threw up in my mouth multiple times while typing this out.

Tl;dr: My little brother and I played with our mom's dildo.

EDIT: I'm getting disturbed by the shocking amount of people suggesting it could have been my dad's dildo. And I'm getting even more disturbed by the amount of people who are asking me to describe the taste of the dildo. And I'm possibly even more disturbed by the fact that my top comment and growing is about me putting my mom(or dad)'s dildo in my mouth. Weird day."

So my friend is a very intelligent and quiet fellow. Minding his own business in a corner of the room. The class turns to him to get his opinion on the matter.

588,"I was placed in foster care at an early age because of abuse. And I had to see a counselor on the regular. This counselor's name was Bryant. Bryant's office was full of interesting things. He had dolls so kids could point to where uncle Jimmy touched them. He had crayons and paper and all sorts of other shit. And he had two plastic totes full of sand. One was full of wet sand, the other full of dry sand. I'm sure I don't know what the ostensible purpose of the sand was. Moving on. 

I was six when the sessions began and for nearly a year I had to see this guy every two weeks to tell him how I felt about my foster parents and how was school. It wasn't until many years later that I realized this guy was a pervert. He always locked the door to his office and then he would pull out the sand boxes and he'd say pretend we're at the beach. He'd encourage me to take my shirt off because, hey, it's the beach. 

On a couple of occasions he tried to give me a massage by pinching my shoulders but my muscles weren't developed. That shit hurt. I told him so and he stopped. 

And that's it. He never did anything else. A year later I stopped seeing him when one of his coworkers got in trouble for hiding X-MEN cards in his pockets and having my older brothers fish them out. It was like a whole organization of creeps.

I spent some time really exploring how much time it takes to complete basic tasks. I started to pay attention to how much time it actually takes to get from point A to point B. I made it a priority to be early, and then gradually fine tuned the process until I was dialed in to arrive on time without being super early. I stopped making excuses for why I was late, and pretty soon I didn't have a reason to make excuses...Now I can be on autopilot and still be where I need to be, with all of my tasks completed, with about 5 minutes to spare.

Everyone is listing a bunch of things that these people can do to make it, which **I'M WELL AWARE OF.** The problem is, no one is thinking about the plethora of circumstances (look for other comments underneath) or depressive state of mind that some people live with. I am not a super leftist social warrior; I just like to look at things from others' perspectives and figure out why things are the way they are. My arguments are based on what I've observed through a lot of volunteering for those in poverty as well as having friends who are also in poverty. I get that there's such thing as lazy poor people out there. I get that they can get help from the government (but gov. housing and food stamps doesn't constitute a very good life or carry a good stigma, does it?). **I get that it's not impossible to go from poor to rich with good education and work ethic. It's just much harder to do at a disadvantage.** ALL poor people having good luck, a clear, aware state of mind, willpower, and opportunity to do all they can dream of is, unfortunately, simply not true. It's not even true for those who have never been near the brink of poverty. To those of you living the dream, having come from dirt poor background, good for you! But see bolded point for clarification of my first post."

666,"Irritable Bowel Syndrome/ Haemorrhoids.

Ever had a shit that felt like hot lava bubbling out of your ass, coupled with the feeling that you are passing glass shards as well, and are unable to pass gas due to the fear that it will tear your anus?

That's exactly what most people suffering from these to conditions feel like. I mean people believe that the time in the bathroom on the john is probably one of the best times of the day when they can relax and be completely at peace. 

I envy these people. People who do not have to deal with the pain and fear associated with suffering from these two monstrosities. And god forbid you have skipped on the fiber in your diet, or had too less water, or consumed too much alcohol or meat, you are in for it the next morning. This pain, combined with the inability to pass motion without straining so hard that the vessels around your anus swell to such a size that you can actually feel the swelling is something I would never wish even on my worst enemy, ever.

And this is just while shitting, no one tells you about the constant pain you have to endure for the rest of the day, the inability to stand, or walk or sit in one place for more than a few minutes. The inability to even want to go about your day normally when you know that if you do not alter your intake at all today, you are in for another one of these sessions the next morning. IBS/ Haemorrhoids is not fun. And is very, very serious. 

If you are having trouble passing stool, or have to always exert extra pressure while doing it and then end up with a dull pain in your anus all day long, visit your doctor. This could very well just be the beginning of it. 

**EDIT 1: Okay, so I am not the lone sufferer from this monstrosity. Glad to know!**

For reference I was diagnosed with IBS and haemorrhoids about a year ago. Since then I have sufficiently upped my fiber intake (not metamucil, I just have more veggies, oatmeal, quinoa, stick to olive oil, prunes have become a part of the daily diet, lots of water (I drink about 7-9 litres everyday), have a lot of fruit in the diet, and have completely cut out any refined stuff, i'm looking at you, bread, you evil monster, and deep fried BS post a night out now is also a NO-NO, i go for a single scoop of ice cream instead of a pizza now on late nights.)

For people who have asked how its going and have recommended some suggestions, I am now devoid of pain when i use the john in the morning. The only instance when it ever causes an issue is when I do heavy drinking late into the night before and do not balance it out with water (hemorrhoid pain + hangover = NO-NO), or have excessively large amounts of meat without balancing it out with veg. Although, in these cases now the pain is very much manageable and wiping after the job is done is not a hellish nightmare anymore. Also, my doctor informed me that losing some weight would help to reduce the stress on the vessels around my anal sphincter, and I am glad I listened to her. The weight loss has significantly improved my comfort levels in the morning.

Regarding the suggestions offered here, all excellent ones, I have put them in a list for IBS/Rhoid sufferers to save you the trouble of going through all the comments,

1. Fiber in the diet - if you are taking metamucil, have copious amounts of water everyday. If not you will get constipated and will be in for even worse hell than you are already in. Other good sources of fiber are whole sprouted beans, carrots, lettuce, celery, cabbage, corn, tomatoes, olives, prunes, dates, basically everything you would find in a green salad.

2. Water - This should really be a no brainer, you must drink a copious amount of water everyday. Not only does it help you stay hydrated, it also makes your stool softer and much easier to pass the next morning.

3. Exercise - I do not exactly know how this helped in my case but it makes the muscles in and around your rectal muscles better conditioned and they relax easily, rather than constricting while you need to pass stool.

4. Probotics - Also a good idea, but beware of the unnatural amount of quite putrid smelling gas you will have after regular use. If you work in a closed office environment, this option is not viable for you, unless you don't mind the stench.

5. Less processed food - Bread and Cheese. Two big baddies, tow things you should avoid if you want to have any peace while passing stool. And while we are at it, if you have IBS, **stay the fuck away** from Mc'Donalds, Wendy's, Subway, Jimmy Johns, Starbucks, Penn Station Subs, In-N-Out, Five Guys, basically any place where the food is excessively processed. Cook your own food at home, sure it may be time consuming and may cost you a little extra in the long run, you will thank yourself later.

6. Less Meat - This one should also be a no brainer. If you know you are in for a meal of only meat (campfires, BBQ pit days, Tailgating events) pre-empt it. Start upping your fiber intake 24 hours earlier. Your system will consequently be thankful to you no matter how much meat you consume. Plus, eating the green leafy vegges is not just for vegetarians anymore, if you have IBS start eating the veggies more and the lean meats more (fish, chicken) and cut out red meat completely (no beef, pork, mutton, lamb **at all**).

7. Using a height differential when you poop (a stool) - Works very well. Forgot to mention that this is how I poop now and it has genuinely been a great help. Not only is it more comfortable, but I also do not find myself straining too hard for the poop to come out.

8. Fiber Pills - Not quite sure how these work, havent taken any myself, but from the comments it seems to be a popular alternative to changing your entire diet. 

9. Psyllium Husk - Taken as a supplement with water and has the same effect as metamucil of providing bulk, i.e. insoluble fiber. Works wonders according to comments that people have mentioned below. Definitely worth a shot.

10. The night time itching cure - Apply a coat of Castor Oil. It is a relatively more viscous oil than anything else out there and it coats over the hemorrhoid to give you relief, since it essentially stops the rhoid from rubbing against other skin and prevents any irritation. The bottle of castor oil comes with an applicator and it has always provided me with much needed comfort when most required. Although, the side effect is it does stain any article of clothing which is then impossible to remove, so be prepared to throw away your night clothes and sheets if you are using castor oil.

718,"My parents never loved me. They was never abusive or put me in any danger. They just never bothered with me. They never showed any emotion. I was a talented rugby player and they never once asked me about it, took me training or encouraged it. They had respectable jobs and had a modest income. Just no time for me.

EDIT - WOW! I really didn't expect the amount of replies or messages from people who have been in the same boat. Thank you all for tips and everything. Reading some of the other replies to this question is truely heartbreaking. Kinda makes me feel ashamed because I had a roof over my head, food in my belly and clean clothes. I was never subjected to anything what would cause me physical harm. My childhood seems very trivial compared to some answers as I had no real hardship. So heres the wee update.

1. I never went to see a doctor or therapist regarding this. I probably should of, but my therapy has been my current fiancee and strangely enough a famous sporting/media personality here in the uk. I can talk to both of them about ANYTHING and they have always been here.

2. I gave up rugby when I was 21. I was playing to a good standard but wasn't enjoying it. Add to the fact I have a smashed shoulder and knee and can't run like I used to.

3. I haven't spoke to either parent regarding this. They divorced 3 years ago due to my mums cheating. This never went on during my childhood, only when they moved to a different part of England about 5 years ago. I am kinda closer to my dad now. We talk regularly on the phone. My mum? I only speak to her on birthdays/christmas and special occasions. We haven't had an argument or falling out, we just don't talk. No resentment at all.

4. I have a son who I adore. Hes 10 months old now and the light of my life. I find myself just grabbing him and hugging him all the time. Giving him all the love and affection I never received. I can hand on heart say I will support him and encourage him with whatever he wants to do in life. 

5. They never had long or stressful jobs. My dad was a very well paid plumber and had  work whenever he wanted it. My mum was an office admin at a school. Paid holidays when the schools were off and a rather nice 8-3.30 job for her. Again was well paid. I really do understand how long and hard working to make a bit of money can cause relationship problems with your partner and your children. But we never had that. We lived in a nice house with a good income and very good working hours.

6. My first ever experience with any sort of closeness was with a friends mum. When I was 7 I had a massive bike crash outside their house. Blood everywhere, damaged bike the lot. She came running out and hugged me, gave me sweets and kept asking if I was ok. It felt weird why she was making a big fuss over me and doing something what my parents would not of done. I didn't feel a longing for closeness because of that hug, it just felt really odd and why would she do that.

7. This upbringing has only affected 1 of my relationships. I was with HER for 3 years and we never really got too close. I bottled a lot of things up. She was distant with me too. It just felt wrong and knew if we had a kid it would be the same situation as my parents. So I broke that off. The current fiancee is my rock. I just knew from the moment I talked to her in the pub she was the one. She has shown me how to love. She has shown me how to care for someone else. She has shown me that I can be 100x the parent my parents were. That is reflected in my son. Im typing this while I'm at work and I just wanna go back home and kiss and cuddle that crazy little fella!"

***Edit*** Wowza, was surprised to see this gain such traction. I will tell the whole story here. I was about 5 or 6 and my mom came home from work (single mom with three kids) me and my sister were only a year apart so she sometimes gave us the same gifts at the same time. So she came home and held her hands behind her back and asked my sister which hand, she chose the right and got a purple stuffed rabbit. I chose the left and got the pink one. I loved that thing. When I was 11, it got its ear chewed off by a dog and all the stuffing was coming out. My big brother sewed it all back together for me and it was back to normal. I kept it until I went overseas. I lived in a compound in the middle of the desert, and one day a really poor local boy offered to clean the compound for money and I let him. He turned out to be a good kid so I let him sweep all the dust and camel spiders out of the compound a few times a week and throw trash away. One day, I wanted to look at my stuffed rabbit, but couldnt find it. I checked everywhere and went threw everything. I asked him if he had seen it and he said he might have put it in the trash pile (BURN PILE). That was that. I thought about getting mad, but then I realized how symbolic it all was. I was grown man and part of being a grown man is not holding people's mistakes and ignorance against them. I do miss it though. "

He holds the cell phone to the kid's ear and she fucking GOES OFF. My buddy said you could hear her across the room. That poor kid spent the rest of the day walking the Green Mile."

794,"Story time. In college my friend rented a house with a yard. He and his roommates never mowed, and so every summer, it would get out of control. One summer, the city sent them a warning: mow the yard, or you will be fined.

By that point, the lawn mower they had was no match for the jungle slowly engulfing the patio. His solution? He went on Craigslist and bought a goat from a local petting zoo... named Mo. 

Kept in the back yard for a few weeks. I never saw a happier goat. All you can eat grass. Well behaved, except for he would eat cigarettes and joints out of our hands if we weren't paying attention.

Eventually we learn the most important lesson about goats: those sonna bitches can jump. Despite our best efforts to goat-proof the fence, he finally escaped. After a few hours of looking, my friend called the city asking if they have seen any goats. Apprently he ended up wandering to the Golden Corral around the corner. It was then that the city informed him that he could not have a goat.

Mo lives on a farm in Waco TX now, doing goat things. My friend and his GF visit every now and again, and Mo always come running to greet them. I miss that goat. 

TL;DR my friend got a goat to mow his lawn. "

811,"I am 43 years old. I have never owned a car.

When I was in my very early 20s I met a beautiful woman, fell in love, and decided to save for a rental property in the area of town that she grew up in. Where we live, in Toronto, Canada, the insurance companies are like mafia or something so they wanted $4,000/year to insure a vehicle. We calculated that when we factored in gas, maintenance and repairs, vehicle cost, and parking we would ballpark the cost of a vehicle at around $10,000 for the first few years, at least until the vehicle was paid for, and the insurance started going down as we got older/driving experience.

Instead, we decided to save that $10k per year. We rented an shithole in a drug and crime infested building, and paid for bars on our windows ourselves. The streetcars ran all night, and that made it difficult to sleep but a transit pass was only $120/month, and the rent was only $550, and we could get downtown super fast. 

We lived in that crack infested prostitute ridden hole for almost ten long sleepless years, and it sucked, but each time one of started feeling desperate and wanted to move out, the other would say: ""but, look how much rent will go up if we move! look how much money we're saving!"" and we were saving money hand over fist. So we stayed. After nearly a decade had passed we had amassed over $100,000 dollars in savings, the vast bulk of it that $10k per year that we would have otherwise spent on a vehicle, like most of our friends in similar circumstances.

We put that money down as a downpayment on a $500k rental on the subway line, in the core of the city. It was also a shithole, it needed a lot of renovations but the location... the location was solid gold. We split it into 3 rental units, lived on the top floor, and rented out the main and the basement. The rent covered the mortgage, utilities and property tax. Every time a renter moved out we repaired, upgraded and developed this property; over the years we rebuilt the furnace boiler entirely, replaced the electric water tank with a tankless gas boiler to save money, replaced every single electrical outlet and fixture, replaced kitchen countertops, sinks, added a bathroom, soundproofed and created a living space in the attic, and more. It went so well that we bought more rentals.

After a decade of living in this property we have had the incredible good fortune to see it more than triple in value in a little over a decade. It's now worth $1.5m and as the rental income has increased, I have accelerated payments on the loan. 

I am very aware that if I had bought a shitty car a little over 20 years ago, today I would have the net worth of roughly: one shitty car. I would be paying my own mortgage, instead of having renters pay it. I would not have a clear path to a wealthy retirement.

Consequently, I see cars primarily as wealth destroyers. A country designed and build around car drivers, impoverishes it's people. I live in one of the most walkable communities in North America, and my net worth puts me fairly high when ranked against others in my community. I will probably be getting a vehicle at some point, because it makes it easier to stay in touch with aging relatives and we ourselves are aging, but I try to spread this simple message:

the difference between wealth and poverty  can simply be a sequence of sometimes difficult choices about live style. When you buy a car, you are not just buying convenience, you are selling the opportunity to invest that money; if I told you that you have a choice: you can choose to own a car, or you can choose not to own a car and in 20 years you will be a multi millionaire, would you still make the same choice?

Many people would still buy a car! but I think it's important to be aware of the choice, that's all."

Orange - orange is different to red. It's like a cup of ice tea on a summer afternoon. It's been around for a while, it is in no hurry. But it is excited for the moment all the same

Yellow - yellow is a spring morning. Warm, but with a pleasant crispness. It has sharp undertones, like eating a lemon. But a sweet warmth to it, like a slice of pie.

Green - green knows what's up. Its happy to be here, and to keep on doing what it's doing. Green is like the taste of an apple, crisp and sweet. But also like a cucumber, mellow and subtle. It is progress, like walking down a road and counting each step to see how far you have come. Edit: Green is also the scent of freshly cut grass, delicate and perfumed; a scent of summer and lush wonders (thanks to /u/tahlyn for reminding me of grass, apparently I forgot it existed)

Blue - blue is a rainy day. Cold for some, sad for others. But also enjoyable. Its a refreshing drink of water at the beach, the sound of gulls and the crashing waves.

Indigo - this is blues older brother. Indigo is like being under water; an immersive warbling. Serene and enchanting. You want to dive into its fur and let it take you in, an opera performance for your eyes.

Violet/purple - violet is a funky guy.the colour of strong, but not unpleasant cologne. It's a colour that takes you out for a long night of cocktails and smooth jazz. You are comfortable around violet, you don't need jokes or stories to have a good time with this colour, just being around is all that you need. Yet , violet is also the sound of midnight just outside the city; a light rumble in the background, but soon drowned out by the hoots of owls and the warm chirping of crickets."

860,"&gt; I envy people who are good at small talk. I suck at small talk.

Here's an algo that's been working amazingly well for me. The crux of it is to take an interest in what the other person has got going on or is trying to achieve. They'll eat it up

**You:** Hey what's up? How've you been?

**Acquaintance:** Hi! Nothing much, and I've been well. How about you? ^(If they don't respond with questions, don't seem to want to talk, or don't seem capable of small talk, try a couple of more questions and make up an excuse and say bye)

**You:** It's been a while since we met. So what's new with you? Have you 

1. [started that thing you said you'd do last time]

2. [progressed in school/college/job] ^(Here, you're asking a question on the off chance the other person is autistic like you, a question gives them a chance to talk about something)

EDIT: Like mentioned by other users, phrase it like this: ""Hey, were you finally able to [start on that thing you said you would last time] or [Completely plausible and valid excuse]?"" ^(This gives them an out without feeling uncomfortable about not achieving that something, and makes them like you a lot more for being kind)

**Acquaintance:** 

1. Yeah totally [little bit of info about $topic] 

2. No unfortunately [little bit of info about excuse]

**You:** 

1. That's great! [probing question about $topic]

2. That sucks dude [some empathy and acknowledge that his excuse is valid ^(If his excuse is too shitty, you can point it out politely or keep quiet about it, depending on your relationship with him/her)] ^(If you don't know anything about his new interest or $topic, tell him straight up; they'll love to talk about it)

**Acquaintance:** 

1. Yeah totally [more info about $topic ^(keep listening and understanding and maintain a decent amount of eye contact)] 

2. Yeah it sucks [brooding about shit luck]

3. Yeah it sucks but [Optimistic alternative]

**You:**

1. That's pretty interesting! [another question about $topic if you want to, or question about their presence wherever you met ^(Don't be autistic and ask them what they're doing at that theater/supermarket/party; it's the same as you. Try finding common ground like ""yeah I love marvel/DC so I'm here"" or ""This shop has the best stuff around so I'm here"")]

2. Yes but [Optimistic backup plan/alternate plan]^(Don't be a dick here and give vanilla nice ""aw shucks"" kind of response here, or for that matter anywhere. If you're gonna encourage, make sure it's logically sound as well)

3. Yeah, it's pretty cool you've got a good plan going on! Me, I've been getting into [something about what's new with you now]

___________________________________________________

\&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;End of small talk. At this point you can continue talking to him if you're interested, because the ice is now broken. But it's pretty ok to make up an excuse or use a valid one to say

**You:** It's been nice catching up. But I really should get going. Take care/Good luck with $topic or alternative. ^(At this point, don't make plans to meet up later if you don't intend to meet up.)

_________________________________________

So you're getting it, right? You need to actively keep listening and not skim over their responses. Listen, process, and respond, and it's no longer small talk. It's also a good idea to tell them their new venture or hobby is pretty cool, and/or they're good at it.

Don't worry, they're people like you. They've got insecurities like you do, so if they don't seem ~~phased~~ fazed by them in convo, why should you?

Good luck, and practice well.

Lastly, it's very important to remember that I'm telling you all this with a certain spirit in mind, but all you're getting is this textual response. Be smart, and know that I can explain it to you, but I can't understand it for you.

Eh, /u/RamsesThePigeon can probably do a better job than me in these things

**Edit:** People are saying that having an algo for what should come naturally to humans is too robotic and fake. I wanted you all to know that I didn't make the algo and follow it IRL. I chose a bunch of good small talk convos I've had with people, found a pattern, and wrote it as an algo here. It looks robotic, but the sentiment and logic behind is entirely human. ^(And also, 2nd gilding in a week; cool!)

**EDIT 2:** Seriously guys, if you just mechanically follow this algo instead of understanding WHY you're saying the things you're saying, this is entirely useless. This isn't an algo for robots; it's an algo for humans, and the human element is what finishes it. When you're asking them about things they mentioned last time it's because you're showing you care enough about that person to remember their life. When you give them an out (plausible valid excuse for not doing what they said they would), you're showing empathy and being kinda and understanding and acknowledging that sometimes, shit happens and that's ok.

Every one of the responses in the algo are generated based on an emotion you should be feeling, but aren't for various reasons."

868,"When I was 12, my mom convinced me that my attraction to girls was because I wanted to rape them (mom...wasn't nice).  I spent my HS and college years deathly afraid of talking to women.  I'd walk across the street if one was walking towards me on the sidewalk.  I married the first woman who seemed interested in me and, when that went to hell, I gave up.

Fifteen years later I tried dating again and was dumped within months.  I had no job, so I spent 3 months in her basement.  I'm grateful she let me stay but now romantic thoughts make me sad.  I don't go out anywhere but to work anymore and I've arranged my schedule to have several days where I work from home so I don't have to see anyone at all for days.  Thanks, mom.

I guess on a positive note, I've always wanted to be a dad but I'm too old, now.  So, all my charity goes to children's services like counseling for abused kids, child advocacy, and homeless kids.  It's the closest I can come to being a father.

Edit: Thanks EVERYONE for the kind words.

To answer some common questions I've gotten as replies and PMs: I'm in my 50's, I've been in therapy since I was 18 (I had resolved a lot of my anxiety around women by my mid-20's, when I got married), my ex was emotionally and physically abusive, and we were married 8 years.  I'm still overcoming that abuse and the crushing depression you've all noted that's a result of it.

I don't blame my mom on how I am.  She was who she was and she's gone now, so what's the point?  I had dogs when I was married but one died the week my divorce was final, and my ex took the other and my pickup truck (a regular country song, that).

When I was ten, my mother and father got in a fight about the food us kids were eating. My mother had recently started going to work, making more money than my father had previously, and so now my dad was looking after us kids and e was not exactly a gourmet. 

Anyways, the result of the fight was that my dad piled us into the car, took us to Walmart, bought us each half a quart of cream, and had us drink it in the parking lot.

To this day I have no idea what that was all about.

EDIT**

People seem to be reading into this too much. This was not some traumatic event. Cream is delicious. Afterwards we threw the football around and went to 7-11 for slurpees. I think the thing my mom was complaining about was that we were (three adolescent boys) always complaining that we were hungry, and mom was worried that my dad wasn't feeding us enough, and that we would waste away.

If you meet someone, particularly if they are young, who is good with money -- knows about IRAs, CDs, hedge funds, investing, does comparison shopping, and spends a lot for good quality but doesn't indulge much in impulse purchases -- they have likely come from wealth.

You would think that people who did not grown-up wealthy would be excellent savers and investors, but it's often the opposite. People from wealth have been taught over the generations how to maximize their money and play the long game with it. They view having money as a given and aren't in a rush to spend windfalls. They have also often learned that extreme luxury doesn't necessarily bring happiness, and make fewer showy purchases."

Combined with their hugely successful ""Pepsi Generation"" campaign, they gained enough market share from Coca Cola that Coke panicked, prompting them to spend years and millions of dollars coming up with a new formula (destroying the brand mystique of the locked up, super secret Coca Cola recipe) that beat Pepsi in taste tests, but utterly bombed in the market.

When she came there was a lot commotion and they were looking at me and kept asking me who did this to me.  I didn't know.  

My parents never brought it up and I honestly don't think the hospital told them what happened.  Maybe people were afraid of losing their jobs or something.  

I never discussed it with anyone and then one day I was riding down the highway with my wife in the passenger seat and I suddenly realized I was a 50 year old man who was still following his rapist's instructions of never telling anyone for the past 45 years.  So I turned to my wife and told her.  I began crying and even though I never really thought about it as a burden, if felt like a huge weight was off my shoulders.

I timed it perfectly and at the exact moment she was supposed to say ZERO my ears were blasted into outer space by an almighty LEEEEROOOOOY JEEEEEEEEEEEEEENKINS, but it was too late and I was already nutting all over myself.

1030,"In 1986, Mkele Mbembe was on holiday in Kenya after graduating from Northwestern University.
On a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. The elephant seemed distressed, so Mbembe approached it very carefully.
He got down on one knee and inspected the elephant's foot and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it.
As carefully and as gently as he could, Mbembe worked the wood out with his hunting knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.
The elephant turned to face the man, and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments.
Mbembe stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned, and walked away.
Mbembe never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.
Twenty years later, Mbembe was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son.
As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Mbembe and his son Tapu were standing.
The large bull elephant stared at Mbembe, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.
Remembering the encounter in 1986, Mbembe couldn't help wondering if this was the same elephant.
Mbembe summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Mbembe' s legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly .
Probably wasn't the same elephant."

""no, no, I literally just saw it get sucked back into the machine. I didn't take it, mate."" and I'm thinking *""oh yeah, sure, the cash machine just fucking sucked the money back in, did it? Isn't that convenient...""* so I stand there arguing with this dude for a good 5 minutes, accusing him of taking my £20 because there's nowhere else it could have disappeared to while he stands there insisting that it just went back into the machine. I'm literally laughing at how shit this guy's excuse is and mocking him ""oh yeah, sure, the money just happened to reverse its course and jump back into my bank account"", people are starting to stop and crowd round as I'm getting more angry at this guy who just stole my £20 and is denying it to my goddamn face with the most stupid excuse I've ever heard.

My cats get all freaked out and hide under the bed, my dishes rattle, my floors shake, I feel emotionally upset by it as well.

But then I hear the dad actually trying to deal with it in perhaps the best way he knows how. I don't know what I could say to him, except unsolicited parenting advice, which nobody likes. What am I gonna say? ""make your kids shut up?"" Im pretty sure he would like them to shut up too.

Edit to add: Wow, I'm receiving lots of suggestions to tell the Dad to abuse his kids to get them to stop. No thanks. I do think I could talk to the kids perhaps (I'm a gril) and let them know how it's personally affecting me (and my cats!)"

But he was kind of rubbing his neck while telling us and we all immediately knew it was sort of out of his hands. His fiancé is from money and it's not a problem to her or her friends and family. We knew it was awkward for him because he's been supporting his mother and brother since he was 19 and never had a great life.

My dad loudly yelled ""asshole"" and gestured at the car, and the guy, proving he was even more an asshole than previously thought, stopped his car, got out and did a few steps to threaten my dad.

My dog gently sat down, managed to make his fur double in size, and did the kind of growl you only hear dogs do once or twice in their lifetime, the kind that says ""You better not make one more step"". My dad did not even have the time to think of an answer before the guy did a full U turn and got back in his car to drive away.

My dad had a hard time telling us the story because he was laughing so much at the face the guy made.


Also, seeing it's about being intelligent, my old dog understood how to open silently the doors where the treats where and close them back, but never did it when someone was around. We had to film him.

The British were outraged to learn this was happening, but of course it wasn't.  At some point the French caught wind of the rumor, and took on the attitude that they could do that if they wanted to.  ""You think your country is too good for our prisoners?""   It escalated through both governments and the military until leaders on both sides had to unilaterally convince the populations that none of this is true.

Edit2:  

Common question:  Are disc golf, frolf and frisbee golf the same thing?

Yes, they are one in the same.  When the game was invented, Frisbees were used.  Very quickly, the game evolved to use faster, higher speed discs, and the name has evolved with it.  The Professional Disc Golf Association is recognized as the sport's governing body.  The PDGA oversees the rules, the equipment used, professional and amateur events and growing the sport in general. 

Disc golf enthusiasts tend to get a bit miffed by the name ""frisbee golf"" because the hippie, 1980's, or casual association with the term conflicts with the seriousness then regard the sport with. 

Also, /r/discgolf is a thriving and very helpful subreddit.

3) I think a better way to explain the infinity of the universe and everything in it (and, similarly, the ""if the universe is expanding what is it expanding into?"" questions) is to think of a number scale, where the numbers go 1, 2, 3, ..., infinity.  If you multiply by two, then your number series is 2, 4, 6, ..., infinity.  It has stretched, but there's still an infinite amount of it.

Edit: questions abound about the radius of the observable universe.  In short, it's greater than 13.8 billion years due to the expansion of the universe."

1120,"There are 52! ways to shuffle a deck of cards.

80658175170943878571660636856403766975289505440883277824000000000000 ways.

How big is that number?

Start by picking your favorite spot on the equator. You shuffle the deck of cards once every second. You're going to walk around the world along the equator, but take a very leisurely pace of one step every billion years. After you complete your round the world trip, remove one drop of water from the Pacific Ocean.

Now do the same thing again: walk around the world at one billion years per step, removing one drop of water from the Pacific Ocean each time you circle the globe. Continue until the ocean is empty. When it is, take one sheet of paper and place it flat on the ground. Now, fill the ocean back up and start the entire process all over again, adding a sheet of paper to the stack each time you’ve emptied the ocean.

Do this until the stack of paper reaches from the Earth to the Sun. Take a glance at the timer, you will see that the three left-most digits haven’t even changed. You still have 8.063e67 more seconds to go. 1 Astronomical Unit, the distance from the Earth to the Sun, is defined as 149,597,870.691 kilometers. So, take the stack of papers down and do it all over again. One thousand times more. Unfortunately, that still won’t do it. There are still more than 5.385e67 seconds remaining. You’re just about a third of the way done."

The other type checks your sugar right now. It cost $5 for the kit and maybe $10 for 25 test strips. Best you to take this test before you eat or drink in the morning. It takes  5 seconds to do. Worry if the number is higher than 130 or so, or over 150 or so if you've eaten in the last couple hours.

Both of these tests involve pricking your finger to get a drop of blood. Man up. Please use this information as a supplement to proper medical care.

- The Duolingo website is much better than the app

- Memrise is good for vocabulary and helps with grammar if you put some effort into it. Most people think it's better.

- Alternatives/supplements include:

   - Mango language

- Duolingo is a good supplement, but to really learn a language consider: 
  - Formal courses 
  - Consuming media in the foreign language 
  - Textbooks
  - Language discussion forums 
  - Researching grammar/syntax online. Wikipedia is a good place to start

 My dog Bailey (Lab/Husky) and her BFF Tess (Boxer) were in our backyard playing around. Tess, being a total idiot as usual, decided to go exploring in the back (all forest, hills, creeks and such) and takes off. Not wanting to lose both dogs, my daughters called Bailey to stay.

They tried calling Tess for 10 minutes before they found me to come help. I came and tried the same for a few minutes. Once I realized that there were no sights or sounds of Tess, I turned to Bailey, and said, ""Bailz, where's Tess?""

We played this game with Bailey regularly. She would find anyone in our family if you asked her to. So I sent her off into the forest looking for Tess. No hesitation on Bailey's part.

Another 10 minutes go by. Sun is going down. Forest is quiet. We start calling for Bailey to return. Sure as shit, not 2 minutes later, they both come back. It was from some distance too as we could hear them crashing through the bush a ways off.

Too painful. Too exhausting.

1249,"When I was 3 years old, my older sister passed away at the age of only 15. She had peanut allergies, and at the time regulations around products containing peanut ingredients were next to none.

I have no actual memory of her existing because I was too young to remember her. But from what I have been told by everyone in my family, she always was there to take care of me through the hard times. It is told to me from her best friend, that my sister never left my side. She brought me everywhere, at only 15. My parents were addicts, and neglect was quite real.

For years I was upset as a young child / teen because I wanted to know her. Then came a time where I was digging through things in my grandparents basement, and found a bunch of her high school binders, ones she was using right before she passed away. There was so much life in them. All the doodles, scribbling of boys names, etc. I finally felt like I knew her on a deeper level... but I didn't have these items for long... About a year after this, my mother passed away. This lead to a whole messed up process as it was just me and my mom (my father passed a few years before), so I was tossed between my grandparents house, child care services, a group home, and a private school. In this process many things were not gathered from my house where me and my mother lived... alas, the mementos I had of my sister were gone. 

I would love to have those binders back. I miss my sister so much. I never knew her, but I will always love her.

I remember when our current cook/maid first started working with us. She sheepishly asked me for hand lotion for her cracked hands (I think she was afraid to ask my mom), I gave her a tube of some decent stuff and she recognized it was expensive and squeezed out a tiny amount and gave it back. I told her to keep it and use as much as she needs until her hands were better and she almost cried. Her previous employers had been garbage people and she couldn't believe she was working for a family that treated their staff like human beings. She's been with us for 13 years now and she is amazing.

1285,"Something I would read up on is practicing **Mindfulness**. In graduate school, I wrote a whole paper on its benefits of relieving stress. When one fails to manage stress, it can be the start of some dangerous health risk factors such as high cholesterol, heart disease, and even strokes

Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the United States for the adult population.  It affects adults of all ages, genders, races, and socioeconomic statuses and is associated with many unhealthy behaviors. Heart disease, also known as cardiovascular disease, includes artery and blood vessel diseases, heart rhythm diseases, and heart defects. This disease is the cause for one in four deaths and 610,000 people in the United States each year. It can be caused by a multitude of unhealthy behaviors. Stress and, more specifically, poor stress management is known to greatly increase the likelihood of the three main risk factors of heart disease; physical inactivity, unhealthy eating, and increased tobacco and alcohol use.  Stress also exposes the body to many unhealthy hormones and physiological changes.  Stress has also been linked to blood clots, which can directly cause a heart attack. However, identifying stress and being able to cope with stress is associated with lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels. 

Currently, 44% of Americans feel more stressed now than they did 5 years ago; 1 in 5 of them feel extreme stress (heart palpitations, shaking, depression). According to the American Institute of Stress, 75% of all doctor’s visits are due to stress-related ailments and stress is the basic cause of 60% of all human illnesses.  Stress related ailments cost the US $300 billion a year, $100 billion more than what obesity costs.   
Work-related stress is the cause for 10% of total strokes.


**What mindfulness is is living life ""in the moment.""** Mindfulness is a state of active, open attention on the present. When you're mindful, you observe your thoughts and feelings from a distance, without judging them good or bad. Instead of letting your life pass you by, mindfulness means living in the moment and awakening to experience.

It is quick, easy, can be done almost anywhere and does not require anything, but one’s mind.  Mindfulness is a very new and exciting field and is in turn gaining much attention in the stress coping research world.  Since it is so new, there are no present statistics on how many adults in the U.S. are practicing mindfulness activities. However, data shows how beneficial this practice can be for those coping with stress.  Grossman and associates performed a meta-analysis on mindfulness based stress reduction techniques and found that in almost all of the studies, stress levels decreased and ability to cope increased, among a broad range of individuals. Significant results on the individual level have also been seen. Individuals have reported significant decreases in their daily hassles, psychological distress, and even medical symptoms. This makes mindfulness based activities imperative for stress coping and may be important for preventing heart disease later in life.  Mindfulness has also been known to have an amazing carryover effect.  Those who use mindfulness to reduce stress are more likely to apply mindfulness techniques to health behaviors such as physical activity and healthy eating.  In result, not only does mindfulness benefit the mind, but also physical health, making the benefits of mindfulness innumerable. 

**TL;DR** Simple mindfulness activities include making time to play with pets and spending time with family, visiting a museum or other cultural event, meditation and yoga classes focused on stress relief, reading poetry, the newspaper, or other small pieces of literature, recreation, and recording one's feelings when being stressed.

1322,"I had really awful periods through most of middle and high school. I had one teacher in grade 8 that refused to let me use the bathroom and said I was goofing off. He threatened to call my parents so I told him to go ahead. Well my dad answered and said I will be there in 20 minutes. He came into the school with a box of tampons for me and then proceeded to make my teacher cry in front of the whole office. My teacher was 50+ year old man. 

Edit: Here is the whole story for those of you who asked. I had already had multiple instances of really bad issues with my period to the point where my mom had informed the school of my issues and had my teachers notified as well and this was rectified with a doctor's note as well. This certain episode occurred after the same teacher had denied me extra bathroom privileges multiple times to the point of me having bled through my pants in class and having to be excused from school by my mom. 

My dad is a rough man, he is a hunter, he likes to drink and does not enjoy talking about or having anything to do with lady issues. So when my teacher called him from the classroom after all of the precautions my mom had taken to help me be comfortable at school, needless to say he was not pleased!  

He showed up with a box of tampons like stated, he was very polite but stern with my teacher at first. He sat down with the principal and my science teacher and simply asked what the problem was and how to correct it. Things would have went more smoothly, with my no bullshit dad if the teacher hadn't said that I was lying and using my female genitalia as a way to con him into letting me skip class. Things didn't go so smoothly after that. My teacher cried, class was excused for the rest of the period, my principal agreed with my dad that I had a pardon from class whenever necessary during my period and my dad went on his merry manly way."

If you are feeling tired always, drinking too much water, or just feel terrible, get yourself tested before its too late.  Please. 


Edit: I'm doing my best to answer your questions.  I know what it feels like to go through weird changes with your body and health alone.  I'm here for ya, so fire away.

Edit 2: I was given some suggestions to put in as more symptoms so here ya go.

feeling very thirsty


•urinating more frequently than usual, particularly at night


•feeling very tired


•weight loss and loss of muscle bulk


•itchiness around the genital area, or regular bouts of thrush (a yeast infection)


•blurred vision caused by the lens of your eye changing shape


•slow healing of cuts and grazes

Extreme irritability

Black mold forming on toilet

Also, drinking alot of water isn't always bad.  It's when combined with the insatiable thirst, or the non-stop desire that makes it bad.  AND ALWAYS BETTER TO BE SAFE THAN SORRY.  SEE A DOCTOR!

Final Edit: I was misdiagnosed as a type 2 due to my former weight. If you think should I get tested again, the answer is YES.

1346,"""Simon and Marcy"", from Adventure Time. Lot of dark episodes from that show, but that was the first that really got to me.


Edit: Adding a description for the uninitiated since this is getting lots of upvotes (Spoiler Warning I guess?): Kooky villain (Ice King) and Protagonist's Cool Friend (Marceline) have a weird friendship that the protagonists don't understand. The backstory is revealed in this episode. Thousands of years ago the ""mushroom wars"" blew a giant hole in the earth and evil magical fallout spreads across the land. Marceline, who is only a child at this point, only has Simon for company, an older professor type. Simon comes across a magic crown that gives him powers, but at a cost - each time he uses the crown, he slowly loses his sanity. As a horde of evil-magic-slime-zombies corner them, Marceline begs him not to use the crown, but he knows it's the only way he can protect her.

It's incredibly tragic. Simon knows he's the only thing protecting little Marceline from being eaten by monsters, but if he keeps using the crown he knows he will lose his grip on reality completely. Marceline, as a child, is terrified of being abandoned in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, as she watches kind, humble Simon transform into a crazy power-hungry maniac who doesn't recognize her. And that's the story behind Adventure Time's Kooky Villain, Ice King."

I was holding my cat and putting some unfinished water bottles back in the fridge. she struggled free and hopped onto the counter but I was too tired to scold her so I continued grabbing huge amounts (6 or 7 at a time, both hands) of half-full water bottles from the counter and into the fridge

I'll even give you my word, this isn't even my primary account, kiddo. Downvote away, downvote to your heart's content. But listen kid, please remember rule 1 of reddit. Treat the other people commenting as if they are human beings. It is fascinating, however, that people ignore the fact that I am right just because the first two people downvoted me. From that point it is just snowballs. When people see downvotes, do they neglect their own ability or reason? It is similar to the fallacy of poisoning the well. Once they see the fact that others disagree, they assume that the person must be wrong, even if undeniable truth is on the other side. It is an interesting phenomenon, and I am not sure how reddit should address this issue moving forward. There needs to be a solution that prevents cases like mine from happening. If someone posts something truthful, it should be upvoted, not downvoted. It is imperative that we allow free speech and the truth to be shared. I don’t care about the karma. Hell, I’ll gladly rake in the coal! But we must remember that free speech and opinions are key to our society and, more importantly, reddit.

One day we were out hunting and I was standing a little way away from him. I looked up to see his pointing his gun at me. I moved to one side just as he pulled the trigger and I felt something pluck at the sleeve of my sweater. There was a small hole in the material. I was so confused and asked him why he had shot at me. He laughed it off and said of course he hadn't, he hadn't been shooting anywhere near me. I didn't question it anymore at the time.

1431,"My oldest sister...


I'm the youngest of three girls and we grew up fairly poor so both parents were out of home a lot working to give us the basics. Because of this my oldest sister ""looked after"" us. My earliest memories involve me running through the kitchen in a diaper feeling so so scared trying to get away from her.  

Anything and everything set her off. If attention was not 100% on her she would flip out, scratching, kicking, hair pulling. My parents were pretty oblivious to all this, or more my dad was also unstable (BPD who frequently went off meds) and my mum was too emotionally abused to do anything to help. She had to have presents on everyone elses birthday, had to have the same presents as everyone else on christmas, or better ones. 

As I was 4 years younger I was much smaller than her and easy to catch. From my toddler years to 16 I had crescent scars all over my arms and ankles because she would dig her nails into my skin drawing blood. 

The very first time it clicked in my head that no one would ever help and she could manipulate her way out of everything is when she stabbed me in the shoulder with a pen. I was about  8 years old. She had yanked out a chunk of my hair so I told her to ""fuck off!"". The look on her face was horrifying because she looked so happy because my dad had been sleeping and woke up to me swearing which was strictly not allowed. She knew I was going to be in trouble so she grabbed the pen off the table and stabbed me then yanked it back out. I ran upstairs to get away from my dad, which was a whole different scary experience and he wouldn't believe that she had hurt me. 

I came downstairs a few hours later when he ""allowed"" it, with blood all over my shirt. My aunt was staying with us and saw it, pointed it out to my dad and they still believed my sister hadn't done it. I gave up all hope for help after that. 

That turned into 8 years of her scarring any exposed skin, pulling out my hair, cornering me and screaming about how disgusting I was, taking every moment to remind me I was fat (She has been anorexic/bulimic most of her teens and adult life), throwing things at me, telling me men will only like me because they're chubby chasers, etc. I am more of an extrovert than most of my family so I always had a lot of friends and ""boyfriends"" in elementary school and than actual boyfriends in highschool. 

When she went away to university my mother thought it would be a great idea for me to visit her there. A whole weekend being alone in her dorm with her. She spent the first day reminding me how disgusting I was, then acted all nice until the evening. She wanted me to watch ""West Side Story"", I think, it's the one with the opening scene of the two gangs finger snapping down the street. Me being 16 thought it was funny so I laughed. Wrong move. She started screaming, threw out all the food, cornered me and let me know how no one in my life actually likes me and they're all just putting up with me because they don't know any better, I'll only ever be in abusive relationships, I don't deserve anything better than that, I'll always be fat and disgusting, etc, etc. Then she kicked me out and made our mother pick me up a day early. 

Mid year she was home and in a rare moment of civility she wanted to ""talk"". She asked me how you're supposed to feel sorry for other people. As in how do you feel empathy? She couldn't figure it out when her profs talked about it. I carefully got out of that conversation. Later that day after she'd done her usual ""you're fat and disgusting"" rant I decided to turn my back on her and not engage. She picked up a text book and hit me as hard she could over the head with it, yanked me by the back of my head and pushed me in the cupboards, to let me know ""you're not allowed to ignore me"". 

I have not spoken to her since that day, I'm now 26 and she's 30. She's still living off my mother and has zero social skills. The last time I saw her she had drank a bottle of wine on christmas eve 2011 and she just laid on the livingroom floor for the day. 

She's pulled a knife on our other sister, she's been evicted for trashing apartments that are in my mother's name, had so many pets die ""unexplainably"", expects to be showered with gifts and attention by everyone around her, she will get angry if family are paying more attention to children than they are to her, she still has to refer to our mother as ""mummy"" and in that high pitched ""muuuummmeeeeee"" voice, she can't hold any platonic relationship, has never had a romantic ones and she still hates me viciously for being able to have relationships. 

I will not be surprised if she ends up killing someone. She is the spitting image of our father in personality.

She lives in another province from me, is still in school, and my mother is smart enough to never let her know where I live. Those close to me know who/how she is and know not to give any information. 

Thanks for that, didn't know I needed it. 
 

**EDIT**  In reading all your replies I'm realizing that I've been down playing all of these experiences in therapy. I've usually focused on the parental abuse side because it's more relevant day to day. Her behaviour has always just been accepted by everyone in our family so I've spent a lot of my life assuming I overreacted to how she treated me. A lot of it is really fucked up but I've just laughed it off for a long time. I remember the first time I told a boyfriend about how my father acted around me and he immediately freaked out and I saw that is was actually *wrong*  and not just *weird*. I'm getting the same feeling here. I'm going to start discussing this more in therapy.

Seriously that guy lived the *saddest* life.  
  
His father makes a rude comment about werewolves which causes one to turn him into a werewolf while he was an innocent child, who had done nothing to deserve it. He then lives his life keeping a secret so that he isn't ostracized from society (Not to mention the excruciatingly painful transformations, as there was no medication for the majority of his life), he finally meets a group of friends that he trusts and likes, who all end up dying/getting arrested/betraying the others.  
  
For the next 10 years after this he is constantly changing jobs and staying away from people in fear of harming anyone. Then finally, a medication to prevent the transformation is made, and he gets a job at the only place he knew as home with the son of his dead friend, only to find out that the friend he thought betrayed his trust escapes from prison, and is expected to kill the son of his friend, until he finds out that the friend he thought betrayed him was framed by another friend. He then transforms into a werewolf and his worst fears come true and he attacks his last remaining friend and his dead friend's son, who has also become a friend. He quits his job in fear that he will attack somebody again, and goes back into hiding. After this the man who killed his friends comes back to life, and kills more of his friends. Despite this he is still able to fall in love and have a baby, until he and his now wife are killed, leaving his baby alone without parents."

1469,"These are called cyclic numbers.  Part of my undergrad research were on these types of numbers.  7, 17, 19, and ~~21~~ 23 are the first numbers that form cyclics.  They are formed by n/p, where p is the full repetend prime used to form the cyclic (say 7) and n are all numbers p-1 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).  

Some other properties include if you split the number into two separate halves, for instance split 142857 into 142 and 857, and add the two halves together you will get a number containing only 9's (142 + 857 = 999).  If you split the number into thirds you will achieve the same result: 14 + 28 + 57 = 99.  

If you multiply the base cyclic (142857) by the prime that produced it (7), you will get a number containing only 9's (142857 x 7 = 999999).  Multiplying by a number greater than p, for instance 8, will give you the following: 1142856.  You can then get back to the original cyclic by taking the right most p-1 numbers and adding the left over numbers: 1 + 142856 = 142857.

If we again break the number into two halves, square each half, and then subtract the resulting numbers, you will receive a permutation of the cyclic.  Example: 857^2 - 142^2 = 734449 - 20164 = 714285.

There are even more facts to cyclics, but this [Numberphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUlaUalgxqI) can explain more!

1498,"My brother started throwing those metal toy tractors at me when he was four or five. A few years later, he'd chase me around the house with knives.

By the time he was in middle school, he was threatening me by pointing loaded guns at me (my dad had an arsenal in the basement, and he taught my brother how to use them all). 

I wouldn't even start anything... he'd just get bored and decide to torture me. And I was left to babysit him because I was a few years older. 

I think what really clued me in was how he'd always keep a loaded gun in the living room in case a small animal came near the house. One time, he shot a rabbit out the window and it didn't die. So he beat it to death with a shovel. My mom would get really defensive and yell at me if I suggested his behavior was sociopathic.

It got really bad when I moved back home for a semester during college. I'd done something to piss him off, apparently, or he was extra bored, and he decided to take some rope, tackle me to the ground, tie my hands and feet together, and throw me in a closet for hours. He only let me out because when my dad was on his way home from work. Now he claims he doesn't remember doing it.

I tried to tell my parents, but as usual, they said we both did stuff to provoke each other and I probably did something to deserve it. I signed up for an on-campus apartment the next day, and moved out of their house for good at the end of the summer.

They guilt trip me for never visiting. I hate my brother; I'm terrified of him. And I resent my parents for letting that happen under their roof and never disciplining him.

1517,"Another bathroom-stall eater here.  For some years in high school I had no friends and thus no one to eat with. Rather than feeling the shame of eating alone, I had rather not be seen at all and ate in the bathroom. Or, like transitive_isotoxal above, did homework in the library or computer room -- at the very least to look like I was preoccupied and not friendless.

Now that this is coming up, I remember sitting near a group of girls for a couple of months regularly. They weren't my friends; a friend at the time (some years I had one or two friends) had invited me to sit with them together. Once that friend transferred schools, though, I had nowhere to go and continued sitting there; not in their circle, but near them. I wouldn't talk to them, would just look down and eat quietly. The only bright spot is that they were very kind about it -- they knew I was shy, quiet and awkward and didn't converse, but they always acknowledged me with a hello/goodbye and a sincere smile, even though it would've been easy to go the mean-girl route and tell me to leave or whisper and giggle about the weirdo that lurks at lunch.

Glad to say that my adult life now is less lonely and much more happy, and that I can actually look back on these experiences without shame or negative feelings anymore. What's past is past."

1519,"I'm going to go with the [Kepler Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_conjecture), originally proposed in 1611 and solved in 2014 (or 1998, depending on who you ask).

The Kepler Conjecture has to deal with stacking spheres. Sphere stacking is the idea of filling space with spheres so that there's as little empty space as possible. To measure how good a stack is, we measure the density of the spheres - basically, if you picked a random box in your stack, how much stuff in the box is sphere and how much is space.

The problem says that there's no way to stack the spheres that gives a higher density than about 74% - that is, 74% of the stuff is sphere and 26% is space. This 74% stack is known as the *Hexagonal Close-Packing Arrangement* and is how apples are often stacked at the grocery store - rows are offset to fill as many gaps as possible.

It's one of those annoying problems that looks incredibly simple and intuitive (after all, that's how we've been stacking spherical things for centuries at least), but is actually really hard to prove. The issue is that there are a lot of possibilities. In the 19th Century, Gauss proved that it is true if the spheres have to be in a regular lattice pattern - if they're in a constant pattern that repeats over and over. But there are an awful lot of ways to be in an irregular pattern.

Finally in 1992, Thomas Hales started to run a computer program that was designed to basically brute-force the irregular patterns. Someone else had shown that the brute-forcing could be done by minimizing a function with 150 variables across several thousand stacking arrangements. All told, the program had to solve around 100,000 systems of equations. The work finished in 1998, but writing up the formal proof didn't finish until 2014 due to the sheer amount of data."

&gt;Hundreds of tons of radioactive dust and fuel are still buried there, covered with an edifice of concrete slabs and metal plates called the object shelter. It was hurriedly erected after the accident, and parts of the old reactor covering are now starting to collapse.

&gt;The worst recent incident was a radiation alert when the roof of the turbine hall fell in, forcing terrified workers to put on respirators and flee the site – and giving Ukrainians a nasty reminder that their Chernobyl problem has not gone away.

&gt;The solution, a gigantic £1.2bn metal shell called the Arch, is finally taking shape in a safe zone, 300m away from the reactor’s intense radiation. A stupendous feat of engineering, already taller at its highest point than the Statue of Liberty and wider at its base than a football pitch is long, the Arch is the gleaming creation of Western corporations, paid for by the G8 nations. One day its 15,000-ton weight will slide on specially laid tracks into place over the reactor, hermetically sealing it off.

&gt;But it is nearly a decade behind schedule, construction has not yet reached the half-way stage, and there are growing doubts about when it will finally be completed. “We want this Arch finished so Chernobyl is safe once and for all,” said Mr Gubariev, 52, head of an organisation for veterans of the accident in the industrial city of Kharkov.

Grandpa with his limp cock tied to a popsicle stick, shoving it down her bottomless throat, her teeth in a glass of water on the nightstand, her eyes watering as she takes it into her throat while the black dildo is still all the way up her cunt into her guts, like a fucking chicken twirling on the spit of a rotisserie, while grandpa reaches around his own ass and plays that asshole like a DJ scratching a record, then inserts his middle finger all the way to the knuckle, no lube to get in the way of that beautiful fucking friction."

1592,"Jerry and Nigel were the best of friends. Both born blue and green striped Hane's crew socks, they were joined when fate (and the hands of a small Malaysian girl) bundled them together and placed them in an assorted three-pack destined for sale in America. Unbeknownst to them, this was the start of a journey of hope, lust, innocence lost, and above all...friendship. 

Their time aboard the container ship was fairly tedious and uneventful at first. There simply wasn't a whole lot to do. Luckily, Jerry and Nigel had company, for they shared their package with two other pairs of crew socks: blue and yellow striped Dave and Francis and blue and red striped Perry and Lance. The three pairs bonded quite quickly, even going so far as to name themselves ""The Striped Sox,"" which they thought demonstrated unity and a common goal. Sure, this name lacked a bit in terms of imagination, but you must remember they were not fancy, designer socks. They were Hanes. This is a company that employs a gambling addict and failed baseball player as their spokesman and whose most exciting developement in the last quarter century is an undershirt without a tag. 

The socks passed their time in various ways. Sometimes, it was by playing games like ""I Spy"" and ""Twenty Questions."" Sometimes, by sharing hopes and dreams (Perry and Lance wanted to be sock puppets that entertained children). Sometimes by sharing their fears (all of them were terrified of ending up alone). 

""Maybe we will end up in Beverly Hills and become reality TV stars,"" Lance hoped.

""Do they wear sandals with socks in America?"" wondered Dave.

""I hope I don't make anyone's calf look fat,"" worried Frank. 

Though nervous about their futures, they were all very excited just the same.

At the end of their journey, they found themselves atop a Target shelf in Sacramento, California. Their stay here was short-lived, however. A pheasantly buxom middle-aged woman with bright red nails named Sandy had bought them for her eleven year old son, Craig, within a day. 

Craig proved to be a test for the Striped Sox. Like most boys his age, he was hard on his belongings. For one, he was fond of running in the yard while wearing socks without shoes. Fortunately, the yard was covered in a think mat of healthy grass (curious in these parts, especially considering there was a drought going on). And Sandy made sure to take good care of them. The socks were always washed on the gentle cycle, then tumble dried on ""low"" and, thus, they persevered.

For over a year, this was their life. It was a good as they ever could have imagined. Like most things, however, it wouldn't last.

Being in the clothes hamper where dirty laundry was stored before washing was the only time that Jerry, Nigel, and the other Striped Sox ever experienced fear. It was a dark, damp place and they were usually separate from one another. And there was the other clothing. Many of them could be quite rude and generally unpleasant. Especially the undergarments. 

""That twat needs to keep her lips shut!"" exclaimed the panties.

""No one supports *us*!"" complained the bras.

""Get a whiff of this!"" offered the boxer shorts over and over.

""Wanna lick my stain?"" the wife-beaters asked the panties. ""It's either blood or BBQ sauce.""

It was during such a time when everything changed for Nigel and Jerry. On this particular occasion, they had lucked out and managed to keep close during their two days amongst the other dirty clothes. They were almost cheerful when Sandy came to wash them. Only this time, something was different. 

Rather than bringing the entire hamper down to the basement where the washer and drier resided, she instead rummaged around for a few seconds. It seemed she was looking for something specific. 

""Maybe she left her cocaine in the pocket of her jeans again?"" wondered Jerry. Before he could ponder further, Nigel was taken.

""Jerry! What's happening?"" 

""Stay calm, Nigel! She's probably looking for her blow! I seem to recall Sandy saying something about a Homeowners Association meeting tonight! You know she hates those! They keep mentioning the lawn...""

But before Jerry could finish, Nigel was gone. Tooken to parts unkown. Anguished, he called out to the other Striped Sox, but since Craig had wore them earlier in the week, they were at the bottom of the hamper and thus could hear his pleas. 

As Jerry lay in the dark, alone, and worrying about his best friend, he was struck by a single thought.

""Sandy's nails...how come they aren't painted anymore?""

The next ten minutes seemed like an eternity. Jerry was scared. Scared for his friend, yes, but scared for himself, too. What use was a single sock in a world of pairs. Especially to a fickle tween? 

""Perhaps Craig will develope colorblindness and end up pairing me with one of the others? Or he could always have a freak lawn mower accident and lose a foot. Maybe...""

Jerry's inner dialogue was cut short. He heard footsteps. Quietly, they scampered over to the hamper. The lid lifted and in flew Nigel. He landed right atop Jerry. 

""Nigel! I didn't think I'd ever see you again! I thought I would have to maim Craig with..a..."" 

He stopped short. Nigel was leaking some sort of strange goo all over Jerry and the rest of the clothes. It smelled like the fruit of a Chinese Chestnut tree.

""Nigel...have you been eating salted yogurt?""

Nigel moaned, ""It...it was Craig. He...he got past the parental controls...""

It took a minute for Jerry to comprehend what transpired. The fingernails, the scampering, the goo...it all became clear - Nigel had been violated. Abducted, used, then tossed aside like a lemon Starburst.  

For a moment, Jerry looked upon his lifelong friend with a mix of fear and disgust. How could things ever be the same? The moment soon passed, though. For Jerry loved his friend and realized that he needed him now more than ever. He held him and whispered ""It's not your fault"" over and over until Nigel fell asleep. 

""We'll always be together, Nigel. Always...""

1641,"Tangentially related: smart-ass response from teacher on behalf of the student.  Had a student that came back a couple of weeks out of class, counselor let the teachers know that his father had passed and he was having a rough time.  I pulled him aside after class one day, told him not to worry about any of the work he missed, ""Focus on getting caught up in your other classes, I'll make things work out here.""  (I was his 10th grade English teacher, we had already taken the End of Year Exam, as far as the State was concerned he was done, and that was good enough for me.  Kid was straight A's until his dad passed.)

Cut to a few weeks later, I'm called into the counselor's office for a meeting with the student's other teachers.  I double check and he's been doing great in class, and work I've assigned has been turned in on time (even though I told him he didn't have to.)   So I have no idea what's going on.  Come to find out his other teachers weren't as lenient on the make up work as I was.  He had gotten behind in all his other classes and had stayed behind, now he was in danger of failing everything but my class, he'd have to repeat the year save for English.  counselor asks me what I did to help the student.

""Oh, well I told him not to worry about anything he missed, and that as far as I was concerned he was already caught up and he could do his best in class going forward.""

One of the other teachers bawked, ""I don't see why we needed Mr. HexedDragon's input, he just let the kid skip out on work!  That's not helpful!""  

I replied, ""The kids Dad just fucking died, you really think the last six weeks worth of history matters to him in the slightest?""

Sean: Thought about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. Stayed up half the night thinking about it. Something occurred to me... fell into a deep peaceful sleep, and haven't thought about you since. Do you know what occurred to me?

Will: No.

Sean: You're just a kid, you don't have the faintest idea what you're talkin' about.

Will: Why thank you.

Sean: It's all right. You've never been out of Boston.

Will: Nope.

Sean: So if I asked you about art, you'd probably give me the skinny on every art book ever written. Michelangelo, you know a lot about him. Life's work, political aspirations, him and the pope, sexual orientations, the whole works, right? But I'll bet you can't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never actually stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling; seen that. If I ask you about women, you'd probably give me a syllabus about your personal favorites. You may have even been laid a few times. But you can't tell me what it feels like to wake up next to a woman and feel truly happy. You're a tough kid. And I'd ask you about war, you'd probably throw Shakespeare at me, right, ""once more unto the breach dear friends."" But you've never been near one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap, watch him gasp his last breath looking to you for help. I'd ask you about love, you'd probably quote me a sonnet. But you've never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable. Known someone that could level you with her eyes, feeling like God put an angel on earth just for you. Who could rescue you from the depths of hell. And you wouldn't know what it's like to be her angel, to have that love for her, be there forever, through anything, through cancer. And you wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in the hospital room for two months, holding her hand, because the doctors could see in your eyes, that the terms ""visiting hours"" don't apply to you. You don't know about real loss, 'cause it only occurs when you've loved something more than you love yourself. And I doubt you've ever dared to love anybody that much. And look at you... I don't see an intelligent, confident man... I see a cocky, scared shitless kid. But you're a genius Will. No one denies that. No one could possibly understand the depths of you. But you presume to know everything about me because you saw a painting of mine, and you ripped my fucking life apart. You're an orphan right?

Sean: You think I know the first thing about how hard your life has been, how you feel, who you are, because I read Oliver Twist? Does that encapsulate you? Personally...

She ended up quitting her job at the end of the year but a couple of weeks into summer she offhandedly mentions how she wants to look into hiring a full time babysitter for her son.  I asked if she was going back to work in the fall but she said no.  She just wanted someone to watch her son from roughly when I left for work until I came home.  I pointed out the whole point of leaving her job to be a stay at home mom was to do that very thing.  I already paid people to clean the home, do the landscaping, and vacuum the pool while I did most of the cooking.  It's not like I expected a whole lot.

We ended up fighting a lot about this over the next couple of weeks until we broke off the engagement and broke up altogether.  She's still friendly with my friend's wives/girlfriends and I've since learned she married a guy who basically works 24/7 to keep her in a life of luxury.

Then I realized that I'm lonely in a room full of people. In a room full of friends having fun, I am alone inside my mind.  

I realized that it was okay to be alone, it was okay not to have many friends. And I learned to love myself.  

All I need is my dog. He is my best friend. My dog saved me.  

I don't know if any of this even applies to you, but I just want you to know I have been where you are and felt what you feel and so have many others. Sometimes you just have to figure out what's pressuring you and causing you anxiety, or to be sad, and question it.  

Are they real friends if they never text you first? Why do you want them to like you? Do you like yourself? Are you happy and content being alone, or do you need to interact with others to be happy? Why? What needs to change in your life for you to feel happy every day? Are any of those changes things you can change, or are they out of your control?  

Now that I don't care what others think, I have a few best friends, a few as in one. And I'm happy with that. You sound like you might still be in high school, and if you are, trust me when I say this: it's almost over. This is the part of your life that will change when you're out on your own. Social rules, cliques, all that will change. Just give it time. Sorry if I'm rambling. I'm here to talk if you ever need. We are all in this together. Just keep your head up. I promise people out there love you not in spite of your flaws, but for your flaws. I love you.  

I'm sorry I didn't mean to write so much.

However, before I have time to react and move, another of my rats walk up to her, takes a firm but careful grip around the base of her tail and pulls her away from the edge of the table.

Now, I know one should be careful in placing human thoughts in animal heads, but usually, a rat ""biting"" another rat's tail is a surefire way to start a fight, and I can't see any other reason to do it except that she saw ahead, noticed the potential problem, figured out what to do to solve it and implemented that solution.

She'll always be remembered my little hero rat.

The person you have been has led to who you are now.  You cannot change that.  This influences the challenges you will face, including those of learning how to forgive yourself.  It will take time.  That's alright.   So long as you're working toward fixing that you're doing the best you possibly can.  You can't expect more of yourself. When at times I found I wasn't who I wished I were I'd remind myself it wasn't me the failure, the fallen. Once you're on the ground the best thing you can possibly do is pick yourself back up. As long as I was working toward that, I was doing the best I possibly could. Perfection isn't possible, progress is.  

So that's how I forgave myself.  I got back up.  I took one step.  Then I took another.  I progressed.  One step at a time I've come farther than I once thought possible.  I hope one day too you may look back proud at just how far you've come."

1784,"When I was about 11 and my sister was 14, she came home from a sleepover with a large red welt on her neck. When my mother questioned her about it, she wove an epic tale of a fight amongst friends, culminating in the use of tootsie rolls as projectiles.  Though she had remained neutral, she was sadly struck in the neck during the crossfire.


My mom apparently decided to see how far my sister was willing to take this story. She feigned indignation and said she wanted the phone numbers for the girl that threw the tootsie roll and the girl that hosted the party, to inform their mothers of the incident.  There was talk of cutting those friends out of my sister's life.


At the time, I was horrified that that had happened to her.  Years later, I realized my mother decided to troll instead of addressing the fact that her daughter came home from a ""girls-only"" ""supervised"" sleepover with a hickey."

Ok everybody, here are some common responses, and below each is my response:

&gt;Hur dur, not **exactly**, pi doesn't equal 3.15!

No, it doesn't. pi doesn't equal 3.14159265, either, but it's good enough for the vast majority of cases and is plenty accurate. For a simple thought experiment like this, 6.3 is close enough to 2*pi and results in an extra 2.7 mm radius over the 1 m stated.

&gt; Wait, this must not work at any scale, right? What about a golf ball, or a bb?

It works at any scale. Wrap a carbon nanotube rope around a speck of dust. It still works, because it's a simple mathematical relationship between radius and circumference. For any change in radius, there will be a corresponding change in circumference that will be 2 * pi (roughly 6.3) times the change in radius."

When I finished, I asked for the check and she explained that it wasn't a restaurant, but a private home. It had once been a shop of some sort, so was still laid out like that, with the sliding door and large 'genkan' (entry hall area) where the family sat when it was hot.

Edit: When I said racing cars, I meant at the track, not street racing or drifting. From a number of the replies, it sounds like golf has either gotten more affordable or it depends on the area. 

Also, I suppose most hobbies, even these, can be done by people who aren't wealthy if it's enough of a priority in your life (you spend extra time to earn money to afford it, get a job where the sport is done to get discounts, etc.). To me, that's more than a hobby, which implies being a casual pastime."

I had to swallow huge bites without chewing (almost vomiting the entire time) to get through my one pancake.

Then, he gets Frigga, the only person Loki really loved, killed by bringing his stupid earthling girlfriend to Asgard, and finally, he has to come to Loki for help and Loki DIES saving Thor and his stupid earthling girlfriend.  (Or not, as the case may be.)

EDIT: Just to clarify what I meant, I don't have a problem with the spiritual and/or mental sides of yoga at all. I'm talking about the canned, commercialized ""brand"" of spirituality that I can't connect with. It's become status-y in my networks, where what you wear, what studio you attend, and how many selfies you post of yourself in warrior pose are what define your lifestyle and how dedicated you are.

The things you can do with a pack of cards:

* Card magic
* [Cardistry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_M_aRtX-bA).
* Card throwing. As a cringey 13 year old I tried to impress a girl by showing her my finely honed skill of cutting pencils with a playing card. She thought I was fucking weird. :(

* Card Games. Popular ones are poker, blackjack and bridge. I love ~~contact~~ contract bridge, it's a fantastic way to keep sharp.

* Memory sport. Two of of the skills required in order to become a Grandmaster of Memory is to memorize a single deck of cards under two minutes and ten decks of cards in an hour. Interested? Check out [Art of Memory](http://artofmemory.com/). They have a pretty active forum community and a really useful wiki.

* Card body weight workouts. Assign an exercise to each suit and pick a card randomly. Perform the same number of reps as the number on the card, introducing multipliers for non-numbered cards. (Note: this is a good method for any technique based activity, really.)

* Grip sport. This is a bit of a cop-out, I admit, but a famous feat of strength is to tear a full deck of cards in half with your bare hands. Being able to do so requires heavily developed grip strength.

* Building card houses on the suggestion of /u/boxofstuff. Good call! Perhaps you'll end up with something like [this](http://www.bucketlist127.com/uploads/images/77b5f8a700f76c60bc8e014e61dc7ad0.jpg).

Yeah, just buy a pack of cards. Four of the activities mentioned (card magic, cardistry, a few card games and memory sport) will take a lifetime to master and ought to provide you with hours of entertainment and personal development.

My first period was math and I did great at math so he let me keep doing that. I would sleep for the first period, then half of the second period which was my study hall, then he would wake me up and I would head to study hall and grab coffee from the teachers lounge on the way. 

They gave me a lot of leeway because my mom was dying and I was working nights to cover bills and still keeping my grades up.

My wife's 87 year old grandmother went through a red light at a three way intersection, skipped off of 5 cars parked along the curb on the other side and cut back onto the road, only to hit oncoming car head on. She claimed when she hit the brakes the car accelerated. She obviously hit the gas and had no idea, but my wife's entire family believes her. 

Extra story: one time last year she was complaining about a noise coming from the passenger side of her car. She said it'd been happening for a couple weeks. I'm inspecting the car for her, and find that the front passenger side tire is shredded to hell. The rim is also completely fucked up. Apparently she got a flat tire a week or two before and had been driving on it. One last bonus, the passenger door was cracked open. Nobody ever drives with her and she never uses it. God knows how long that door had been open for.

A guy a couple years younger was working and thought the owner had taken the gas cap off of the boat. He placed the gas nozzle in a fishing rod holder. It is basically a hole in the top of the side of the boat. He proceeded to pump about $40.00 worth of gas on to the floor of the boat. The owner was understandably upset.
1929,"I actually just barely prevented this from happening. An undergrad was working in the genetic research lab I'm doing my PhD in. Keeping things clean and eliminating contamination are pretty high priority in our lab. Different people will use different chemicals - ethanol, hydrochloric acid, or bleach are the most common.

He started inviting me to have lunch with him and he taught me chess (he was a state champion), got me interested in aeronautics, and let me teach myself CAD on his computer.

What came out of my anus can only be described as a plague of biblical proportions. A brown gust of liquified excrement erupted out of my ass and hit the water as if Poseidon himself were squatting above the ocean unleashing the contents of his vast bowels.

The fish never stood a chance. Once my ass had spluttered to a halt I was able to observe my work. The whole tank was opaque brown. Within half an hour most of the fish were floating dead and the stench of raw sewage filled the room.
In my shock and excitement I had also managed piss myself. A smelly puddle had soaked through the shag pile of her bedroom carpet. Tell tell footprints of urine and my dripping bottom led to my bedroom where I had apparently passed out on the floor with my trousers down and a solitary dead fish clutched in my hand.

2025,"Oh man, I've had this joke memorized for over a year now and I use it whenever I can, to the annoyance of my friends. Idk where I found it originally, but I saved this version earlier on when I was still working on memorizing it.

So this horse is watching MTV. This is in the 90s where MTV actually had music on it. Anyway, the horse sees a segment on Jimi Hendrix, and decides there and then he wants to become an internationally-acclaimed guitar player (because, as we all know, all horses are left-handed).

So this horse works at this shitty job for a couple of months, earning enough money to buy himself a low-end Strat. He starts playing Hendrix songs in his spare time, trying to recreate the sound he fell in love with. Eventually, he records a few covers and gets on YouTube with them.

Now, this horse thinks he's doing pretty well, and decides to start a band with the other guys from the nearby farm. So he goes up to his friend, that just happens to be a chicken, and tries to get him to be the bass player, as the chicken was a sweet-ass bass player in college. Chicken agrees and decides to bust out his old bass from the attic; they learn the rest of Hendrix's first album.

Now the horse and chicken think they can go pretty far, and decide to ask their friend, that happens to be a cow, if she can play the drums for the band. She agrees, and they all decide to pool their money together to get this awesome fucking set of drums for Cow. So Cow learns the drum parts for all the Hendrix songs, and they reckon they can go really fucking far with this.

But guess the fuck what? They need a fucking singer to complete the set. So Cow goes up to her friend, who knows can sing like a fucking legend, and asks him to join the band. For the purposes of the joke, the singer is a pig. So Pig learns all the parts for Hendrix's first album and they eventually decide to branch off and make a load of different songs.

This horse, as the band frontman, gets the band to go global - they start performing at gigs across Europe, Asia and the Americas, with the help of the farmer himself (who was slightly bemused at his animals talking, let alone being a fucking band), and eventually get noticed by none other than Jay Leno himself. Leno invites them to California to perform at his show, which coincided with the kick-off for their cross-US tour.

So the horse, as the frontman, flies over to California first to set up and make sure the gig runs smoothly. Everything's good, and the rest of the band, a week later, board a plane to California as well.

However, the plane ditches into the ocean, sadly killing all the passengers, including the band and the farmer as manager. A couple of days later, Horse hears about this and becomes distraught at the deaths he basically caused.

Horse hits a full-on depression, and decides to kill himself so as to be reunited with his friends. He roams the seedy back-alleys of California, trying to find the shittiest club so as to drown his troubles away. Eventually, he finds one, takes 15 Ketamine pills and walks in.

2029,"My sister in law had an outdoor wedding, in Oregon, in June, with no contingency plan for rain. So it poured buckets.

They scrambled to put together a makeshift canopy for the ceremony, but all of the seats were in the rain, so nobody wanted to sit by the canopy. They basically got married in front of 50 empty chairs while a crowd of people stood off to the side on the porch.

The bridesmaids were all wearing these crazy spike heels, and all the rain had softened up the ground. They kept getting stuck in the mud when they walked up the aisle, and on the way back down the aisle, one of the bridesmaids fell and sprained her ankle.

The flower girl (who was probably 4) cried because she was cold and refused to walk down the aisle at all. Can't blame her.

The pastor (my father in law) was afraid to hold the microphone because everything was so wet, so nobody could hear anything he said.

And then nobody wanted to dance or anything during the reception because the stage/dance floor wasn't covered, so we all just sat around huddled under umbrellas and tents.

Oh, and their family doesn't drink, so there was no alcohol. 

Edit: I forgot about this detail! The centerpieces on the tables had beta fish in them, and I don't know if it had to do with all the rainwater or not, but all the fish were dead by the time the reception started. Actually pissed me off, because wtf did the fish do to deserve that?"

2038,"**The Monty Hall problem.** 

You're on a gameshow. There is one grand prize that you can win but it's hidden behind one of three closed doors. The other two doors have nothing. You are asked to select one of the three closed doors. Once you choose a door the host opens one of the remaining two doors that does not contain the fabulous prize. 

The host then asks if you'd like to switch your choice to the one other unopened door. Do you switch?

Statistically you should because there is a 66.6% chance the other door is correct and only a 33.3% chance your door is correct. 

Most people will argue, vehemently, that there is a 50/50 chance of having the correct choice so switching is irrelevant. But you actually had a 66.6% chance to choose the wrong door to begin with. Math-Magic!"
2039,"**[UPDATE]** I found the [post where I originally told this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2fibxd/z/ck9pdgo) and i think did a better job of it.

In college I was dating a girl whose roommate, let's call her J, did this in the extreme.

When J got drunk her habit was to come back to her room and strip before bed. She was getting drunk nearly every weekend. And J had a boyfriend who would often sleep in her bed on weekends (no shenanigans in front of my roommate, they only slept in the same bed when my gf was there).

OK so one night J comes back and goes to the wrong floor. Goes into this shy dude's room, strips naked, gets into bed with him, and falls asleep. He's awake like halfway through this telling her to get out, she's like nooo I just want to sleep and powers through.

He does the gentlemanly thing and sleeps on the floor, then takes care of her hangover the next morning.

(Dynamic: He's a shy pimply dude, she's a very attractive naked girl in his bed.)

Outcome: J's bf finds out, breaks up with her, she asks if it would be okay to visit shy guy next time she gets drunk to repeat. It becomes a regular thing, he takes care of her when she gets drunk and gets to sleep next to naked hot chick in return (she told him to come up off the floor... it's only fair). My understanding is nothing happened but sleep.

College."

2050,"I used to work as an aide in a hospital in my early 20s. Patient was 21 years old had undiagnosed testicular cancer that was growing for 6 months prior to him coming to the hospital. The cancer metastasized into his gut and blood system. I performed care for him one morning with his entire family standing bedside, gut bloated from all the bile building up in his stomach. In the middle of adls he began to choke (common because of the bile build up) no big deal the nurse grabs the suction we had bedside and starts suction to clear out what we thought was a minor amount if bile. 

 As soon as she begins to suction the patient begins vomiting violently up more and more and more and starts to seize all while still choking. The bile in his stomach had gotten too full so the body attempted to remove the bile by pushing it back up the food tract. All the while the family is watching this event unfold. 

 We slam the code alarm and usher the family out of the room, no one needs to see their son choking like that. We tried everything we could to stop the bile from coming up as much. The amount of fluid and the smell is something I won't ever forget. I watched a 21 year old patient go from cracking jokes to literally choking to death on his own vomit in a matter of minutes. 

 The worst part about it was about an hour or so later the mother of the patient came up to me, reeking of alcohol and hugged me and said she was sorry I had to witness that I was younger than him and it isn't right. The mother of the dead patient apologized to me because her son died. I will never forget that day, those smells, the sounds, the picture is burned into my brain. "

Where I grew up, we had this little football ~~court~~ pitch in the neighbourhood. It only costed a football (decent ones ~~costed~~ cost around 10-20 euros, iirc), and you could have a whole lot of fun with that...

EDIT: I got a lot of replies telling me how expensive running or cycling can get. It's true that good equipment is expensive. But the question was about hobbies. So like I mentioned in some replies: Unless you really want to do a full marathon or participate in Le Tour de France, you won't need the most expensive equipment on the market. 

I still use my old Adidas sporting shoes. They are around 4 years old probably, used them to play football on said pitch, run around (5 km at most), and use them currently to go to the gym. My bicycle is [an Old Dutch bicycle](https://www.google.nl/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwif97aV1fDMAhWGuBQKHbM_DQUQjRwIBw&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jorttweewielers.nl%2Fproducten%2Ffietsen%2Fstadsfietsen%2Fbatavus-old-dutch-0&amp;psig=AFQjCNGILkTTzSbwLDD8W4q4S0Kdx1Do2g&amp;ust=1464108991481299), 10 years old, almost falling apart. I still cycle between 30 and 90 minutes on it everyday. No, I won't win a fucking Giro d'Italia with it. But the question was, what are hobbies that cost almost no money. That bicycle is not even worth €10..

So yeah, I could say playing football would cost me hundreds of euro's a year, because I have to pay the league I play in, get my kit, €200 new nike football shoes, a €50 ball... You don't need any of that to actually have some fun. We used to fucking play the game on bare feet and used our jackets as poles... Just be creative to make the best out of the worst..

2155,"Radio astronomer here!  As the profession implies, I am fascinated by radio signals from out there in the universe.  It's the closest thing you can get to magic without a bag of salamanders, if you ask me.

Now there are a lot of other parts of the spectrum you can fall in love with, I guess, but the radio part occupies a very unique area.  Different things in space emit at different frequencies depending on what is causing the emission- the sun's peak emission is in the visible spectrum, for example- and there is a lot going on in the universe that you would only know about if you looked in the radio.  A sampling:

- Pulsars were discovered in the radio, and for good reason- pulsars are a type of neutron star that are the size of a city, so if you wanted to detect something the size of a city light years away with a normal telescope, heh, good luck.  We can now see some neutron stars in stuff like X-rays too, btw, but the most fascinating thing about them if you ask me is we *still* don't know what is causing neutron stars to send out giant amounts of radiation in the first place.  We know they pulse because they are rapidly spinning and this beam is passing us, and we know how this rate changes to the order of nanoseconds per thousands of years... but no one has a clue what's causing it to begin with.

- The only way to begin to know anything about magnetism in the universe is by studying faint polarization shifts in radio wavelengths.  Considering it likely affects things as much as visible light does, that's not insignificant!  Magnetism in the universe is still a big mystery though.

- The brightest radio thing in the sky is not actually the Sun like in optical, but Jupiter when it's flaring.  These flares are caused by [Jupiter's giant magnetosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere_of_Jupiter), and there's ideas that we should be able to detect extrasolar planets via the same mechanism someday.  We can already detect aurorae on brown dwarfs in radio!

I could go on and on, but to get back to why radio is powerful.  First, we are lucky enough to occupy the ""[radio window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_window)"" part of the spectrum, which means radio waves come straight through the atmosphere.  Not insignificant to consider if you're an X-Ray astronomer, say, and [Hitomi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitomi_\(spacecraft\)) just got destroyed after millions of dollars in expense and no replacement for a decade.  Second, radio waves are the most low energy out there- a *single snowflake* contains more energy than *all* the radio waves we have ever collected from outer space!  Which is why people keep thinking SETI would happen in radio- not that it can't happen elsewhere for sure, but the energy is just soooo much less than anything else.

Trust me, radio astronomy is the music of the universe, and there is nothing quite as cool as tuning in to it. :)"

When I was a kid, maybe 7 or 8, I was watching TV in my parents' bedroom for some reason. I dropped the remote between the wall and the bed and when I reached to grab it, there it was. I was shocked. A severed penis was on the ground! I immediately ran to my father to inform him of my horrifying discovery. ""Father! A cut off pee pee part is on the floor in your room,"" I told him. He seemed confused and somewhat concerned. I lead him to the scene. He picked up the flesh colored dildo and told me that it was just a lotion bottle. I was very relieved that it wasn't what I initially postulated but also very confused as to why they would make a lotion bottle look exactly like a penis.

A few years later, I realized what I had actually discovered. My dad played it out very well. He had me convinced. I can only imagine the conversation my parents had that night.

2218,"This is an awesome story. It just goes to show you how having the right teacher can make a *huge* difference in how well you understand a subject. 

For example, I had shitty, mean teachers in 3rd and 4th grade. I loved reading, science, english, etc. anyway, but I always hated math and thought I was bad at it. 

When I got to college I had a math instructor who was a grad student from China named ""Joey"". The first day, someone from his department came and introduced him, and explained that he had literally *just* started speaking English. We could barely understand anything he said at first, and many of us were sort of pissed about it. Like, when he said ""equation"", it sounded like *ee-kWAY-SHON!"" Or, he'd always say ""you"" instead of ""your"", etc. 

 Add to that the fact that he seemed like sort of a dick. If you asked him a question, he'd make you come back after class and sit there for a half hour and do 10 problems until you got it right.  (I mean, he would *insist*, like follow you outside and bring you back in unless you had another class or something.) 

Then, the straw that broke our backs was when we found out after the first (excruciating!) test he gave us that he was teaching material that was *far* more difficult that what the instructors in other sections were teaching. So, we complained to his department chair. 

The next class, he came in and stood quietly looking at his feet for a while. Then he looked up and his eyes were all focused and stern. He said, in that accent, 

""You are angry because I give hard equation, and these other instructor, they no give hard equation. They give easy equation, soft on mind and gentle in heart. I give hard equation to hurt your mind and heart. 

I come here to see and learn, to teach you equation and find Phd. I see Chinese kids, they get hard equation when they are small. They pass every test. I see other instructors, they give soft equations to grown-up student. 

I care. I give you hard equation. Those other student, they don't learn how to do equation. They fail test. They fail all hard test. Those instructor do not care. Those instructor do not fail test, student fail test. 

I give you hard equation that hurt you. I give you hard equation, make you heart strong! (He slapped his fist on his heart over and over.) Hard equation make hard mind and strong heart! You pass every test! You not afraid of any test! 

We do hard equation now. Get pencils. Go.""

It might not come across in writing, but this speech was *profoundly* moving for some reason. Like, a few of us were in tears. 

From then on, we didn't complain. For this particular math subject, everyone had to take a test at the end of the semester which determined where you'd be placed if you took another math or a class that required math knowledge above college algebra or something. 

Everyone from our section placed in the highest rank. *Everyone, all 18 of us.* The other sections (there were 12, I think) only had four students do this. 
Joey was goddamn right. 

Being a grad student myself, now I realize even more what a great teacher he was. Most grads wouldn't be willing to spend 5 minutes of their own time trying to teach shit to some arrogant, ignorant undergrad who didn't even want to learn the material. Joey, on the other hand, was literally *chasing us down* to *make* us give a shit. And somehow, *he actually did make us care!* 

We nominated him for a ""best teacher"" type award at our uni. He didn't win it, which wasn't surprising since we were literally his first students ever and the award typically went to tenured profs, etc.  But a year later, I saw on a web bulletin that he had won it. He definitely deserved it. 

I wonder what he's up to now.

2236,"The McDonald's Monopoly game. It's 30 years old and still going strong.

But the interesting part is how it works behind the scenes. If the distribution of properties was truly random, people would be very quick to assemble a full set. Either by eating a lot or by exchanging properties online. To avoid that (because who wants to give out free stuff ?), McDonald's used an interesting - yet pretty obvious if you stop and think two minutes - strategy. In every full set, all properties have roughly the same rarity, except for one, which is much more scarce than the other ones. There's a lot of immediate advantages. One, it's much harder to complete a set, since one of the pieces is pretty rare. Two, after only two or three purchases your average customer will probably have two or three almost-complete sets (missing only the rare property each time), which gives them a strong urge to buy more since they're only missing one property to win a big prize. And finally, the best part, *everyone is missing the same properties*, so there's little interest in a parallel market.

It's overall a very well thought advertising/promotion campaign. It's very effective at luring customers in and keeping them in, and at the same time does a very good job at *not handing out prizes*. It's not unusual that no one wins the big prize in a given year.

On the other hand, it gave birth to a lot of creative scams. Here's [an interesting article on the matter](http://priceonomics.com/the-mcdonalds-monopoly-fraud/)."

First, there are monastic rules that forbid eating after noon, so on a retreat people will eat as the monks do. This means breakfast, lunch, then fasting unitl breakfast the next day. Naturally, most of us would load up our plates for lunch well aware this was going to be what held us over for the rest of the day. The food was generally good - some Asian cuisine, some American. One particular day, a southeast asian family brought food for the entire 30(?) person retreat as well as the monks as part of a celebration and donation, quite a generous gift. I had no idea what anything was, but I loaded my plate up as usual and sat down to eat. It was a bit spicy. I was sweating. Some bites actually tasted more like chemicals and fire than food. It might have even been 'good' if that's your thing, but I'm a guy that struggles with jalapeno poppers sometimes. But everything the monastery was providing was for free, and everything the monastery received was through donations. It would be quite rude to not finish my plate. Even more so since this family had just provided an entire buffet for 40 people. I managed to get it all down with about 2 gallons of water. And I was sincerely thankful to the family for their generosity.... but god damn that was difficult to eat. It wasn't a matter of anything being ""gross"" rather that it was painful.

2277,"Which, by the way, *everyone should do* on The Price is Right if they are the fourth person to make their guess.

It's interesting how few people realize this.

Suppose the first three guesses were 500, 300, and 700. Suppose you think the real price is 600. Even if you're pretty darn sure that the real price is almost exactly 600, *you will still be correct* if you guess 501.

If the first three guesses are 500, 300, 700, and you guess 600, then you will win if the true price is anything between 600 and 699.

If the first three guesses are 500, 300, 700, and you guess 501, then you will win if the true price is anything between 501 and 699.

You only *increase* your chance of being right if you say 501 instead of 600. There is nothing you can lose by switching from 600 to 501.

(With one exception: On The Price is Right, I think you get a bonus of $100 cash if your guess is exactly right. So if you are *certain* that the real price is 600, then say 600. But if you are just making an educated guess, then if you think it's 600, you should say 501.)"

The light switch symbolizes the narrator's thirst for insight onto the methods of turning off the water. The tool box represents the narrator's attempts to solve her problems which end up having no use when it turns out that the others have already solved the problem.

2. The significance of the two sisters  represents the narrator's relationship with society. Having only one sister would imply that the narrator had no relationship with society. A lack of sisters would simply mean the story wouldn't exist.

3. Sisyphus and the protagonist have many similarities, in a modern fashion. Both the narrator and Sisyphus worked on pointless scenarios.

But anyway, Azula was always clearly ""evil,"" but when we learned about her childhood, about how she sought praise, aimed for perfection, and desired affection from her mother, it really helped paint a sort of pity when she goes down at the end of the series, screaming and crying.

But in reality, you are learning so many little fun nuggets about the people and times you're recreating, that you bring that stuff alive for the public.  There are so many unique facts, so many cultural things that you can talk about, to get other people just as interested and enjoy history so much more. 

A great example- I have started a group to talk about dogs through history, using dogs as a connection to material culture.  So I did some research of course, focused on Greyhounds, because that's what I have.  I found out that George Washington had several Greyhounds in his time, including one named Cornwallis, who he took on his presidental campaign in 1792.

2409,"When I was married to my first husband, we went to his brother's house for Thanksgiving. His brother's wife was ""cooking"".

I say ""cooking"" because she bought everything from a deli, prepared, and still managed to fuck up most of it:

* She bought a whole, smoked turkey, and stuck it in the microwave, instead of reading the directions on it and putting it the oven. Needless to say, she dried it out.

* She also decided to nuke the sides (mashed potatoes, gravy, stuffing) in the flimsy plastic containers that they came from in the deli, instead of into microwave safe containers; they ended up melting in the microwave.

* She bought a frozen pecan pie, which needed to be baked. She instead ignored the directions and let it thaw. It ended up being served as ""pastry with praline sauce.""

But at least she bought some nice brown-n-serve rolls...which she didn't brown. She served 'em, though!

TL;DR: Everything you shouldn't do to a catered Thanksgiving dinner, my first husband's sister-in-law did."

2411,"**Read everything from Gunther Anders.**
He was spot on, on everything. Radio, tv, modern music, atomic bombs, cars, 3D movies (in 1954!),  computers. He wrote mainly during the 40s and 50s. His views on technology are profound yet extremely accessible.

**He's talking about ""supra liminality""** (as opposed  to infra liminality). Liminal as in subliminal: the input threshold / intensity that is enough to notice a signal. So supraliminal would be: **what is too big for us to feel a difference**. One death is terrible, ten even more so, but then one hundred or one million is not ten times or 100'000 more horrific.

Applied to technology, this is fascinating. He introduces the concept of **""promethean shame"". We are smaller than our creations, we can't grasp the effects of what we do, so we feel dwarfed and feel shameful for not being as perfect. ""We're ashamed that we are born and not manufactured"".** Smartphones, VR and transhumanists come to mind.

And it goes on and on, every line he writes is just amazing. His labeled as a philosopher, but he refused that. And he uses a quite simple language, even if he could have done the opposite easily.

1. Heat the oven to 180 C if you're fan forcing it, or if your oven is from the Jurassic period and doesn't have a fan, 200.

2. Peel those damned carrots.  No, not the potatoes, just cut the eyes off them cos they're getting up there like OP's mom, and take the stringy stuff out of the pumpkin with a spoon.

3. Cut up the fucking vegetables.  Everything into quarters except the goddamned pumpkin, make that a bit smaller than those shitty quarters that you made the potatoes out of.

4. Grab the trays out... using the heat-resistant mittens you knob, then rub that shit with canola oil until the whole thing has a thin film, stick the vegies on a tray and the taters and meat on another, sprinkle salt and pepper on the veggie tray, and add some rosemary to the potatoes.  That shit that comes out of the meat that isn't blood will make those potatoes sing like Adele, but less talented. Spray lightly with some more of that wonderful canola that you bought at Walmart/wherever the fuck you shop.

5. Stick that shit in the oven for fifty minutes if you bought a topside.  You bought something different, didn't you...

5a. Go play on your Xbox/PS4/PC/watch telly.

6. Grab that.. OH MY FUCKING GOD YOU FORGOT THE MITTENS AGAIN?  Anyways, grab it out, put the (not your) meat on a cutting board, wait a couple minutes and cut.

Also important to note, the crew don't just jump into their shuttle and immediately off they go.

Back to Shepard, who is sitting on the launchpad, tilted backwards 90 degrees with a stomach filled with coffee.

2520,"Piano Class at the High School level. 

The lab was all digital, so everyone played on keyboards and they were wired together. This was mainly so the teacher could sit at one station the whole class, connect to a student's station, listen, and then chime in and help them. Everyone had headphones and microphones. It helped because then you could interact with students without interrupting anyone else. You could remind them of certain techniques that could improve their play without drawing anyone's attention...so it worked on a whole different level of being able to talk to students about their errors without embarrassing them. You could also, and here's the important part, connect two pianos together so each student could hear the other one and talk. They could play pieces together. It's pretty cool.

In comes Theo. I'll call him Theo because that was his name. I'd often connect to his station and he wouldn't be doing anything. I had to constantly remind him to keep working. The thing was, Theo actually had a fan-fucking-tastic ear. The kid grew up in the church jamming with his friends for hours each week. Whenever he played without music he was very very good. His playing had such nuance and the embellishments he would add were advanced. He could play at a similar level to me, and I have a degree in Music Education. I've taken piano lessons for many years at that point. When you made Theo read music, though, he got very confused. Now, some might say Theo passes that class hands down, but I'd remind you that part of the class is actually learning to read music. There were tests to identify rhythms, name notes, etc. It was a big component of the class. Other students were graded on this, why wouldn't Theo be held to the same standard? Another important point of this story is that Theo could have probably just memorized everything and fooled me, but he didn't want to put that much work in. He said, ""Fuck it I'll do it live"" every time.

During our final exam ([Charlie Brown Christmas Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQybajU2GNk)), each student played for the class. Consider it like a recital. I would put their piano on speaker and the class would be the audience. It's Theo's turn, and he needs to do well on this because he has been failing/not doing the written work. Before he starts he asks me if I'll come check some random setting on his piano. He was like ""Mr. Telestrial..my low notes ain't comin' out!"" Which actually happened from time to time. All the kids knew what to do, though. You just flick the keyboard off and on in the back and viola--fixed. Theo didn't do that and kept complaining, so I quickly walked over and did it for him.

This is where Theo's friend, Xavious comes in. Xavious went to my station while my back was turned and wired his keyboard to Theo's headset. I fix Theo's keyboard and stand off to the side. Theo starts in and it's very very good. He's getting everything right. He starts at a great tempo. The bass is clear. The right hand is coming through nicely. He's jamming. The class, knowing Theo's struggle, begins to murmur in affirmation. Theo turns around while he's playing and that's when I noticed his head kind of bobbing up and down.....like you do when you're listening to music. It dawns on me. I look across the class and see Xavious hard at work. Staring at his book and playing. He turns to see me and stops...and so does Theo.

Xavious was playing the piece for Theo, and Theo was, by ear alone, transcribing it in his head and playing it for the class. I mean fuck me..I couldn't even do that. There are college classes that last 4 semesters about being able to hear and transcribe at that level. Let alone to be hearing it slightly ahead, transcribe, and put your fingers where they need to be.

God damn. I felt bad forcing him to retake it during his lunch hour and having to fail him. I know Reddit wants that feel good ending but...yeah. The class is about reading music, and Theo never put forth the effort to do that. In fact, with his skills in piano, he had a hypothetical shorter path to passing the class than any other student. Most were learning to read music and learning to play the piano. He just had one component, and he wasn't willing to put in the time. Still, one of my favorite cheating stories because it was so elaborate. 

**TL;DR Piano Class at HS level. Kid wires his piano to another's headphones and the other kid actively transcribes and performs the final in real time with the whole class watching.**

EDIT: For those asking about Xavious, I had a conversation with him about it and his reasoning was he was helping a friend. I made it clear that I could report him to the office for academic honesty and sort of scared him a bit. I let him sweat for about ten minutes, but I ultimately let him go. I moved schools but the rest of the time I was there I'd always see him in the hallway and we would exchange nods. As for Theo, he ended up failing the class and I think he was put on academic probation for it. I see a lot of replies of ""but he's so good. You must reward it!"" I tend to disagree for multiple reasons. Chiefly, how many people do you know with extraordinary talent but who fail at applying themselves? This is something Theo needed to learn. You can be the best and barely (or not) get by, or can WORK and actually get gud."

2544,"Rocky. Now please hear me out.

The Rocky sequels are entertaining, but they undermine the very point of the story of Rocky.

People forget that the original Rocky is actually an understated, subtle story that sets the template for every underdog-overcoming-the-odds tale to come. It is all about this man who has been nothing his entire life who gets the opportunity of a lifetime. He knows that he is not the boxer Apollo Creed is. He knows that he is not going to be the world champion. But all he wants is to prove to himself that he's worthy to stand up to him, and have his woman by his side when it's over.

That's it. The ending of Rocky is one of the greatest movie endings of all-time. They just staged the greatest, most epic fight you've ever seen, and if you're not REALLY listening, you don't even realize that Apollo Creed actually won the fight. All that matters is that Rocky lasted the 15 rounds, and that Adrian makes it to him in the ring.

The sequels are completely unnecessary. They are all entertaining in their way, and I actually think Rocky Balboa was a nice way to wrap it up, but the story of Rocky is not about a roided-up badass taking on ""villains"" in the ring.

It's sad that everyone thinks of the sequels and nobody remembers how wonderful 1976's Best Picture really was.

My grandfather was a Nazi soldier. He is still alive and has told some stories, though he doesn't talk much about it. 

He joined at the age of 17, spring of 1940, just before France was invaded. He didnt join because he held fascist personal beliefs, but because he was poor, had finished high school, and couldn't afford university. He has no ""horror stories"" about his first year; Army boot camp is army boot camp, no matter what era or country you're in. 

After finishing boot camp, he was a grunt. Although he was in Germany, he was not deployed for active duty, but rather carted from base to base to work for soldiers who were out fighting. Most days consisted of meal prep, cleaning, and filing records. He was a hard worker and an obedient teenager for a few months before he got his first orders. 

During the siege of Leningrad, he got orders to accompany several other men to an undisclosed train stop where he and the others escorted ""far too many passengers from one train"" to the gates of Auschwitz. After the gates had closed with the train passengers inside, he was sent back to the train stop to wait for more people, this was his job for approximately 3 weeks. He says some days several over packed trains would come through, some days you would see no one. He describes the days where no trains came as the worst days. The days with no trains left their post eerily quiet, forcing them  to listen to the screaming and gunfire coming from inside the gates. 

In the late summer he received orders to head to a camp for ""additional training"". He and 5 other young men from his group were picked up by a high ranking officer and driven for several miles to a camp. He said the officer was very kind and told all the young men in my grandfather's group they were headed for big things and guaranteed advancement. On the ride, they passed my grandfather's parents house. 

Grandpa lived at this new camp with the 5 from his group, about 20 other older men (late 20s, early 30s in age) and 4 higher ranking officers. He said everyone was nice and considerate of each other, there were even days where they would play football (soccer) and board games. The officers didn't talk down to anyone in the group, everyone was treated equally when they were not in training. Around this time he got comfortable and let his guard down, he thought maybe things weren't as bad as he had been hearing. 

After being at the new camp for about a month, grandpa asked an officer if he could leave camp for a couple hours; he explained his mother's house was only a mile or so away through a field, and that he'd be back before nightfall. The officer agreed, but insisted my grandfather be accompanied by 2 other soldiers. They immediately headed out, made it to his mom's house in about 30 minutes, and we're given sandwiches and hugs to take back to camp. The other soldiers were appreciative, as we're the officers, and this may have had something to do with a little bit of favoritism he received. 

A few days later the officers and older soldiers had left, my grandpa and the 5 men from his train guard group were left behind to clean, grandpa was put in charge. After their work was finished, the others suggested going for a walk, to enjoy lunch out in the sun. Grandpa was hesitant, but agreed. 

While they were eating on the side of the road, all 6 were captured by Russians. Their weapons and gear were taken from them, they were bound and put into the back of a military truck. None of them spoke Russian, and none of the Russians spoke German. Everyone was terrified.

He says they drove for days, being moved from truck, to train car and back again. Most of the ride was silent, everyone was too scared to speak, not that anyone could understand each other anyway... he thinks they stopped on the 6th day of driving. It was nearing the end of summer, in russia, and it was cold. Each man from the group was given an old blanket and a pair of boots. They were lead into the woods where they walked for almost a whole day.

They got to a clearing that had an old house and a shed. The Russian soldiers knocked on the door of the home and a woman answered, grandpa doesn't know what exactly was said, but he thinks it was along the lines of ""were putting prisoners in your shed. Feed them... or dont. Just don't let them leave"". The 6 of them were locked in the shed on the edge of the property. 

This is where he lived for 5 years. Once a day a Russian soldier would bring 5 bowls of water with a potato and a plum sized lump of uncooked bread dough inside. They were let out twice a day to use the bathroom, which was just the outside wall of the shed. Once a month they were given damp towels to ""bathe"" with. Everyone was sick, 2 men died within the first year.

Grandpa says winter was the worst, they preferred to use the bathroom inside the shed because exposing bar skin to Russian winter air guaranteed severe tissue damage. One of the 4 remaining men went outside to take a piss and his urine stream froze inside of his urethra. This man developed a kidney infection and died. His body was left in the shed with them for about 2 weeks. 

With only 3 men remaining and a corpse in the shed, everyone got sick again. Surprisingly, all 3 pulled through and went on to live another 2.5 years without much incident. At the 4.5 year mark, illness came over the shed again, one more man died. My grandfather took it upon himself to move the body towards to door to maybe signal to the Russian solder they'd like it to be taken away. The guards did not come with their meal that day, or the next. The weather was warming ever so slowly and dead bodies tend to smell pretty bad. The other man in the shed began vomiting on a regular basis.

3 days passed without food. On the 4th day, a woman brought water and 3 potatoes. She noticed the body by the door, shook her head and closed the door. She didn't remove the body, but she didn't take the 3rd ration with her either. Grandpa and his remaining companion were very grateful. 

Every day the woman would come with water and 4 potatoes, once a day, for about 12 weeks. One day she came and opened the door, but she didn't carry anything with her. She left the door open and walked away, looking back a few times as she did. 

For 2 days my grandpa and his friend stayed in the shed with the door open. Leaving only to use the bathroom just outside the doorway. 

On the 3rd day, they woman came back, she stared at them and pointed towards the house. Several minutes went by and my grandpa finally stood and approached the door, the woman nodded and pointed to the other man who also stood and moved forward. The woman turned and walked away, all the while pointing at the house. They followed her and eventually made it inside. 

She gave them a loaf of stale bread, a glass of milk, a shot of vodka, and new pants and shoes. Both men cried, my grandpa kissed her hands and her feet, the other man was unable to right himself after collapsing in tears. They ate like wild animals. They then attempted to clean the woman's kitchen and sitting room. She came in and smiled while handing them a news paper. It was August 6th, 1945. 

After some communication with hand gestures and nodding, my grandfather and his friend slept on this woman's stove, which was still warm from the previous fire that was inside. In the morning they were given water and a potato and hurried out the door. They walked together to the nearest city, stowed away on a train, made it back to Germany and parted ways.

Grandpa made it back to his mom's eventually, and was met with shocked stares and eventually warmth and love. He stayed at home for a year, got healthy, and made the decision to move to america. 

He worked in a tool and dye shop, then as a welder. He met my grandma (who broke his thumb when he extended his hand to shake) got married and had 2 sons. 

He doesn't tell anyone his story that isn't part of his immediate family, he's afraid he can still be charged with war crimes. 

He mostly spends his days in the garden with his calico cat, drinking beer and eating potatoes. He loves potatoes. 

*Edit: there seems to be a lot of confusion on the timeline from everyone here and myself so I called my grandma.

1. I called grandma because grandpa gets upset when we ask him about the war. 
2. He's only talked about it 3 times in my life, in small parts, the above is how I've pieced the story together. 
3. Grandma says he was in russia from the fall of 41 to the summer of 45, so that's 4 years, not 5. 
4. I asked her if he counted the winters, she said ""it's always winter in russia"". (Thanks, grandma 😐)
5. She asked why I wanted to know everything, and not wanting to tell her I spilled grandpa's deep dark secret on the internet, I told her I signed up for Ancestry.com and was just trying to fill in the gaps. 
6. Grandma doesn't know much else, he gave her the whole story one time shortly after their wedding in 1956, and has since only spoken about it in bits and pieces. 
7. He was part of the Hitler Youth, he may have been drafted as opposed to choosing to join. His phrasing was something along the lines of ""after school I went to the army."" I assumed it was a choice.

2643,"my mother has schizophrenia, which is common knowledge in my family, but no one knows what it was like living with her. i was like 8, i believed her delusions, why wouldn't i? she was my mom. she kept me up all night listening for people i couldn't hear. she had me photograph cars she thought were following her. she would point out people hiding in our backyard, i couldn't see them but if she said they were there, then of course they were there. i don't remember how long it went on, a year, maybe more. my grandparents eventually figured out what was going on, but no one ever bothered to let me know it wasn't real. i thought we were going to be killed at any moment. neighbors, family members, her bosses i'd known my whole life, she was suspicious of all of them. i've had really bad anxiety ever since. i have ptsd, every doctor i've seen has told me i'm a mess (in kinder words). i went untreated for years, until i was 24 or so. treatment has helped but it still keeps me from living a life. i've finally accepted that i am probably not ever going to be normal, but it's hard. all of my friends are getting married and having kids, they all have careers, and i'm just kind of existing. 

anyway. that was long but it's something i've kept to myself for years. i've never even told my doctors most of it.

2685,"Edit: [Since people have been asking for pictures of my pets](http://imgur.com/a/y531m)

I told my sisters first, separately, when I was 19 years old. Both of them hugged me and told me that they'd known since I was 4 years old. I then asked them why they couldn't have just told me that they knew all along, because it would have made my teenage years in particular a lot easier. They both just wanted me to come to terms with it on my own. 

When I started dating my first boyfriend, I introduced him to my family as my friend, and he and I started spending more and more time together. When I realized how much I liked him, I went home one day and sat down across from my mother and said to her: ""You know Matty isn't just my friend, right?"" and she looked me square in the face and said: ""I know,"" and started crying. When I asked her why she was crying, she told me that she was just so glad that I was finally happy again. I had suffered from some pretty severe depression during my teenage years, and she could see that this guy was bringing me out of it and was incredibly grateful for it. 

She ended up telling my dad, (because I just couldn't bring myself to do it) a few days later when he told my mom in conversation that he was worried Matty might be gay and I probably shouldn't spend too much time with him. My mom replied: ""Ralph, what do you think Benjen is?"" And it suddenly struck him that I was gay. Instead of freaking out, I think it just confirmed for him something that he had known all along as well. Both of my parents have become two of my biggest supporters immediately after I came out, even though I was incredibly worried that my father especially would disown me. 

My twin brother found out a few days later. Matty slept over one night, and things got out of hand, and I woke up with a hickey on my neck. When my brother saw it later that morning, he tackled me to the floor and started throwing punches at me. I was always stronger than he was, so I flipped him off of me and Matty and my mother held him back from me, all the while he's *screaming*: ""DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS GOING TO DO TO MY REPUTATION?!?!"" He ended up storming out of the house and peeling out of the driveway in my mother's car. He called me 3 days later, sobbing. Apparently he went to his friends and started bitching about how he found out that I was gay, and all of his friends just kind of shrugged and said that they had figured for years and didn't really give a shit. I don't really talk to my brother anymore because he's basically a worthless turd when it comes to stuff like this. 

Matty and I have been together 8 years. We own our own house and have 2 dogs and a cat. It's been pretty great, and despite one shitty reaction from my twin brother, my coming out was pain free and the best thing I ever did for myself. It completely changed the path of my life."

Candidate:  I think I'd accomplished everything I could there and am looking for the opportunity to grow my skills and . . .

2803,"Driving in general, but tail gating is another one people dismiss way too easily. Tail gating is a terrible, dangerous habit that makes traffic worse. You don't go any faster on their bumper, it only puts you in a position where you either over brake (slowing traffic flow) or get in an ""accident"" (slowing traffic flow and possibly killing/injuring someone).

Edit: one other small note on what I'm seeing in the comments. Part of the reason you leave that space is for people to change lanes and move around. People need to change lanes for traffic to flow. As long as they aren't going slower than you when they move over, they're doing it right.

Edit 2: One more point I'm seeing a lot, the worst people on the road to tailgate are the ones going under the speed limit, especially in left lanes. As youre probably yelling at them ""LEARN TO DRIVE"" you are well aware they dont know what they're doing (they're generally lost or terrified) and are the most likely people to lock up their brakes for no reason. Again, tailgating doesn't change your speed or theirs, it accomplishes absolutely nothing other than putting yourself and those around you in danger."

When I was 16, the heat in our house got shut off. It was the dead of winter in Michigan. My mom liked to spend her disability checks on cable and mountain dew,  instead of bills. 

My sister and I gathered up all the blankets in the house and we both slept in the living room on separate couches. What no one knows is during the middle of the night my sister kept saying ""I'm too cold.. is there any more blankets?"" So I gave her mine. I tried sleeping in my winter jacket but ended up being too cold.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

EDITED because RIP my inbox:  2nd marriage for both.  We work the same job - two different shifts.  I recently moved in to ""his"" house.  However, I paid for the addition that doubled the size (and likely tripled the value) of ""his"" house - which is now ""OUR"" house.  Therefore, we are total equals when it comes to owning the house and we are both on the title/mortgage.

Add to that, I single handedly funded the start up of our new business (which is equal to the cost of the addition).  So we both ""earn"" the same from our business together, and we agreed that the start up cost would be at the benefit of my taxes (fair).

We are total financial equals and if not, the scales tip on my side to funding life together.

When we had a minor spiff about noise at night vs noise in the morning, I was told that as a woman, I need to bow down to *his* needs for quiet at night (the source of the noise being the laundry machines) and he could walk like a cave man in the morning if he wanted to.

2827,"To expand on this: there was a disagreement on doctrine within the German high command. Erwin Rommel was in charge of the Atlantic Wall series of coastal defences, and Gerd von Rundstedt was Commander-in-Chief in the Western theatre, so there was some overlap and uncertainty between their roles. They also fundamentally disagreed over how to position German armoured forces to best counter the forthcoming Allied invasion: Rommel, aware of overwhelming Allied air superiority believed that any invasion had to be defeated immediately on the beaches, and argued that Panzer divisions should be placed as near to the likely landing spots as possible. von Rundstedt, fearful of the huge Allied naval firepower, instead believed that any defence of the landing grounds was futile, and armour should be committed in a massed, co-ordinated counterattack rather than thrown into the battle piecemeal. Hitler intervened in the conflict with his own solution: distributing three Panzer divisions to Rommel for local defence, and keeping the four others in an ""OKW Reserve"" that was actually under his personal control.

So when the actual invasion commenced, no one had the authority to command those armoured forces in the OKW Reserve until Hitler himself woke up.

Did it make a difference? No, probably not. The German high command and Hitler himself still believed - thanks to the extraordinary deception tactics and intelligence successes of the Allies - that the main invasion would be aimed at the Pas-de-Calais, with the Normandy attacks being a diversionary force. Even in the case of those extra armoured reserves being immediately committed, the bombing and sabotage campaign of Allied air forces and the French resistance made the movement of these armoured groups slow enough that a half day of delay would've made a significant difference for only two of them (the 12th SS Hitler Jugend, and the Panzer Lehr). As an extreme example the 2nd SS Panzer took 21 days to get to the battlefield from its starting point in southern France!

His family objected to the wedding because they wanted to have a big, 300+ person wedding in the states so that everyone could come.  He and his fiancee were set on having their wedding abroad and honeymooning in Mexico, so they went against his parent's wishes and held the wedding there.

They refused to go and basically tried to sabotage the wedding.  His mother even went so far as to call florists and bakeries in the area they were getting married to try and cancel what they'd ordered.

He found out and told his parents to stay out of it and let them have the wedding they want.  He revoked their invitations, although they weren't planning on going anyways.

Fast forward to the wedding, and the day before they're set to wed, during the rehearsal dinner, his mom shows up.  She flew down last minute to give one last shot at ruining everything.  The bride lost her shit and they almost got in a fight.  That night, he called around to local places to see if he could hire security for the wedding in order to keep her out.  They planned to get married on the beach, in the sand, so there wasn't a venue coordinator or anything that would be checking invitations. 

He hired two guys that looked to be about 14 years old, because that's all he could find.  The day of the wedding, she didn't show up, or at least the security guys told us that she didn't.

2936,"""Voodoo Dildo"" It's a bit long, but it's one of my favorite jokes.

A businessman is getting ready to go on a long business trip. He knows his wife is always horny, so he decides to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn’t much like the idea of her screwing someone else.

So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation, to the old man.

“Well, I don’t really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don’t know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except a” said the old man, and then he stopped.

“Except what?” asked the businessman.

“Nothing, nothing,” said the old man.

“C’mon, tell me! I need something!” protested the businessman.“Well, sir, I don’t usually mention this, but there is the ‘voodoo dildo,’” the old man said.

“The voodoo dildo?” the businessman asked.

The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said, “Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!”

The old man said, “But you haven’t seen what it’ll do yet.”

He pointed to a door and said “Voodoo dildo, the door.”

The voodoo dildo rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said, “Voodoo dildo, box!”

The voodoo dildo stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, motionless.

The businessman said, “I’ll take it!”

The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say, “Voodoo dildo, my pussy.”

He left for his trip satisfied things would be fine while he was gone.

After he’d been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dildo. She lay down, placed the box between her legs, and said “Voodoo dildo, my pussy!” The voodoo dildo shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she’d ever experienced before.

After three orgasms, she decided she’d had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off! So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she’d had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn’t been drinking, but that a voodoo dildo was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn’t stop screwing her.

The officer looked at her for a second, and then said, “Yeah, right. Voodoo dildo, my ass!""

People said it smells horrendous but I didn't think the smell was that bad so I thought the stories of it's taste might be exaggerated too.

One day, I was driving to meet my friends for dinner. It was about 6:00 PM and I was stopped at a red light. Both of my windows were down, and I was playing ""One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer"" by George Thorogood. I was patiently waiting for the red light when I heard a really loud rumbling come from behind me on the road. I look to my left and I see a man on a motorcycle. He wasn't wearing a helmet. He was wearing an all black suit, had gelled hair slicked back on his head, and Ray Ban Wayfarer sunglasses on his face. 

In my head, I imagined that he was a groom at a wedding. He was standing there waiting for it to happen, and he realized he'd rather live a life of freedom, travelling the globe and bedding beautiful women from foreign countries. In my version of events, he looked toward his best man, who knowingly reached into his suit pocket. The best man threw the groom to be a set of keys and a pair of sunglasses. the groom jumped off the altar and hugs his best man, whispering ""Have her man. You deserve her."" 
He runs to the back of the seats, spotting his bride and saying ""Baby, you don't love me. I know you're in love with my best man. You're a great girl for staying loyal to me all this time when you really wanted him. But I've got to be loyal to myself. Marry him. I'm out."" He grabs her by the waist, and with tears in her eyes, he kisses her passionately for the last time. She looks toward the best man and laughs, then starts walking down the aisle.
The groom runs out of the building and jumps on his Harley. He fires it up and takes off, unable to comprehend that he'd just thrown away his entire future so that he could travel the world and stay true to his wild, adventurous spirit. He speeds down the highway toward Mexico, finally content with everything in his life. 

[Back to real life] He looked over toward me and cocked his head back in a ""What's up?"" Gesture, and before I could react, the light turned green and he took off.

In reality he was probably just coming home from a day of work and I happened to stop next to him at a light. The story I concocted in my head for those thirty seconds at a red light is probably as far from the truth as one could get. But based on my own idea of where he came from and where he was going, from now until I die, he will be the single coolest thing I've ever seen. 

Edit: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger! I'm glad my vision of the coolest man ever gave you some joy!"

They'll turn on the outside hose when they get thirsty on a hot day(even though they have ice water inside) but they'll also get the bathroom door open when you're taking a shower and turn the shower off when they think you've been showering for too long. 

They're very smart but very scary. When my SO and I were walking around after we got done setting the tent up at a family camping trip(my SOs family) I went to go take a leak. So I took two of our German Shepherds to the bathroom with me and left her with one. She can handle them all of course but with deer and squirrels and stuff you just don't know. I trust them to listen to her but why take a chance. 

So while I'm in the bathroom and my two dogs are hanging around outside I hear a distant but very angry and aggressive bark. Now, my dogs are very well trained and don't bark for no reason unless told to. I hear one of my two let out a ""wtf?"" bark and another distant bark from my SOs dog. 

At that point my dogs start going crazy so I'm like what the fuck might as well let them go. I let them go and they just barrel over to where I left my SO, I'm talking full run and barking. Of course I pick my pace up and I get a look at the situation. It's three guys cornering in on my lady. Only thing holding them off was the dog she had. 

I have to tell my SO to let her dog go right as my two get to her. All the dogs pounced at what seemed like exactly the same time and they all end up on the ground. 

But after that my dogs just take a seat right on top of the three guys. They don't even try to fight the dogs off at that point. Ten seconds later after I called the dogs off I figure out why. All three dogs have bitten almost through one of each guys arms. 

It's smart not to fuck with someone with a dog, or worse multiple dogs.  "

When my family had to relocate across the country, she moved with us. When we moved back, so did she. Then I went through my divorce, and for reasons I still don't understand she wrote me out of her will. I didn't know this and continued taking care of her for over a year. My ex-husband let it slip one night after a few too many drinks and painkillers following a bad car accident. My mother told him she had disowned me. I didn't believe him, I thought he was just fucking with me. She died last month, and it was then I found out it was all true. My name wasn't even mentioned in her will. Like I never even existed to her. It's left me in a very bad place emotionally."

3023,"this is similar to when my boyfriend and I first started dating. I come from a working-class family and his parents are both very educated and extremely successful and pretty wealthy. 

in the beginning, I remember being in awe at how he would just grab food from the shelves and put it in the cart without looking at the price. he just got the best kind of every item that he wanted and did not compare prices. I pointed this out to him one day and he was found it really interesting. it was just something he had never even thought about (and he is a pretty self-aware, class-conscious guy).

when I was growing up my mom would go food shopping on Friday. every Thursday night after dinner she would go through the store circulars and clip a big stack of coupons. each week the grocery list was perfectly added up and totally planned out. we never got anything on a whim. she didn't always buy the cheapest thing per se, because as I got older we weren't poor, but it was very carefully planned because they were extremely conscious of where each and every dollar went.

it's been interesting for me to watch my own habits because for all of my early/mid-20s this was also how I shopped. now that I have had a steady job for 2.5 years now with a good income I am a little less meticulous. it still feels weird, like I should be more careful. also food shopping for me is very different than for my parents. I live in Brooklyn and sort of grab groceries during the week as I need them; they made a weekly trip.

anyway there are so, so many more little differences between the two of us because of our upbringing. it has been fascinating to figure them out!

When he went to get cigs, I saw that he had a loaded gun next to him.  

We went back to campus and he went to say goodbye to this girl he liked.  I called the cops, they circled him, and got the gun off campus.   The girl he liked ended up getting engaged to him later.

Afterwards he sent me a death threat.   Him and the girl are both drug addicts now.  

After it happened, I didn't get a thank you.  I got asked if I wanted to step down from my position or go through therapy and then talking to the Dean of the college.

Didn't even get one thank you, and had to plead with them to let me continue my job.  (Ended up saving another guy from suicide later that year)"

It takes 10 minutes to scan a book and the changes will pop out as you scan because you can tell where the breaks change in paragraphs and chapters. You can also go onto the publisher's website and they will list the changes between editions, usually with page numbers and sections listed in the change log. Take the book over the xerox machine and copy the 5-10 pages with changes and put them in the back of your older edition. 

The entire process always took me 30min max every semester and I saved thousands on txt books. I recommend everyone do this.

EDIT: Also, check to see if there is an international edition available for your txt book."

3210,I live in a town that holds the headquarters to a Fortune 500 company. Getting a car for graduation is common practice. Most of the kids I went to high school with all had BMWs and Benz by 10th grade. They either get upgrades or a different car once they hit graduation. In the case of my best friend her parents felt bad about having another child 15 years into her life and then felt bad because she got kicked out of marching band and then wanted to congratulate her for getting rid of her ex bf.  So she's had 3 cars. I'm slaving away at Applebee's in the hopes that I can start payments for a $2.2k 1998 Jeep. Life's unfair. 
3211,"I realized my sister wasn't normal &amp; super narcissistic when everything about my wedding had to revolve around her. She made life a living hell on earth.

If she didn't get her way, the slew of gut wrenching insults came my way. We're about 3 1/2 years apart &amp; I am the oldest (she is the middle child). She has no empathy, she never apologizes, just says the worst things ever &amp; ""moves on"" like I deserved her wrath. She has the temper of a 5 year old, blows up all the time &amp; then makes everyone around her feel sorry for her. Now that I'm pregnant, it's only gotten worse. I've had to remove her from my life as it's one of the most toxic relationships I've ever experienced. But that's when I first realized that she may be a narcissist. 

Edit: Seems like a lot of people can relate. I just want to clarify I don't know for certain my sister is a narcissist but she had a lot of the qualities found in the latest DSM. I am not a licensed clinician &amp; am aware that it is a hard thing to diagnose &amp; that's what I said that ""she may be a narcissist"".

3242,"Youtube before it was bought by google. My YT account is 10 years old now, and I miss the old days. When you could find almost any show on there because companies didn't care enough yet to DMCA them. When star ratings were displayed with each thumbnail. When it was more about the users, and less about the money.

Also, I miss the old internet culture. The internet was something that was separate from real life. We were always told then to never, ever put our personal information on the internet. Anonymity was the norm, and no one would even think about trying to get rid of it. It meant that your identity was about what you did and not what you were. And no one really cared if someone said shit to them because none of it was real. We were all someone else, and who cares what people say about him.

Now everything tries to be integrated. Tries to put your real identity out there on the web. All the ego and status signalling and identity politics of real life came with it. It lost some of its unique feel, and now it's starting to become like every other social venue.

I guess that feel isn't gone yet. There's still plenty of places where I can just be lines of text on a screen. But it seems like that's getting pushed out by the part that wants the internet to be another part of life."

Ross as a character told men that basically that if you hold out long enough, act like the nice guy and be a good friend to her, you will get the girl in the end. He fucking started it all, or was at least the biggest example of this behaviour in popular culture. He had a generation of guys thinking that being the quiet nerdy ""friend"" who acts as the shoulder to cry on, will eventually win out, that ""acting as her friend"" will have her see what a good guy you are eventually. 

Jesus christ the term friend zone was first coined in friends by Joey describing Ross's behaviour. 

Ross had no balls, he was creep that did not respect his friendship with Rachel and could not just move on from an unhealty obsession. The show would of been much better if he was called out on his behaviour and actually moved on and grew, but instead the worst possible thing happened, he some how managed to end up with her. 

This told many guys out there that you need to hide your feelings, be manipulative and not to worry as you will get her in the end, that you are much ""better"" than the others guys she sees and that you are ""meant"" to be. It thought guys the delusion that they are ""the perfect guy"" for her and being her ""friend"" will show her this.

Friends has a good bit to answer for but Ross is by far one of the biggest.

Arthur Conan Doyle based the character of Sherlock Holmes off of an Anatomy professor he had while attending university.

3279,"I feel you about the drug addicted mom :( My parents had joint custody and my mom would take my lunch money that my dad would give to me when he took me to spend my days with her. She got $500 a month in child support from my dad on top of stealing my lunch money. One thing I'll never forget is having Christmas come and my only present was a bottle of strawberry syrup and the wrapping was a brown paper liquor bag. She was so messed up that she couldn't get it together enough to get a single present for me. My guess is she just improvised and realized there was syrup in the cupboard already. 

I would take my school clothes and bag them up in at least three bags to try and keep the cig smoke off of them from her two pack a day indoor habit because I got called to the office in 5th grade because I smelled like I was smoking cigs. I had a chronic cough from her secondhand smoke and it didnt stop her from smoking inside. 

My dad finally got full custody when I woke up at 3am to my mom screaming at her biker boyfriend for smoking her crack and I told her I was willing to testify that in court. She signed over custody shortly after. A lot of her issues were more mental though, so I have kept a relationship with her and she is doing pretty well compared to then. 

Before this all happened, she was the perfect mom in almost every way, then  one day something changed. (My dad actually can recall the exact day she stopped acting like herself) Within a year she was divorced from my dad and in the situation I spoke about above. Went from awesome birthday parties and amazing homemade sewn Halloween costumes to alcoholic drug addicted delusions and getting picked up from school in the middle of the day to save me from ""Satan and the people following her"".

3294,"I was a bridesmaid at a Mormon wedding.  I am not Mormon.

I was not allowed in the Tabernacle, I instead had to wait in the waiting room where they played (multiple times) this weird cartoon that I think was supposed to recruit me.  On a VCR.

Afterwards we took the obligatory wedding photos; which was the real reason I was there, to stand by the bride as she didn't have family that could make it. 

The fun started at the wedding reception.  Being a Mormon activity they didn't have alcohol.  The only two (including me) that wanted these two to be married were them.  So it was awkward.  Our table was the only one that was non-white and not whispering so we got lots of side long glances.  It was a bit uncomfortable.  

Then my freaking salvation walks in.  Her hot as shit cousin flew in from Mexico and didn't give a shit about conventions.  I had felt like people were secretly whispering ""whore"" under the breaths because I was wearing a dress that didn't quite reach my ankles but this girl, whoa this girl.  

She struts in and if there had been a DJ there would have been that cliché record scratch followed by a hurried queuing of ""She's a Brick House.""  Yeah, that hot.  Banging body with leopard print, skin tight, cleavage down to there, hemline up to there gold dress. 

Freaking amazing!

She came and sat with us, I leaned over, introduced myself and told her she's my new favorite person.  Suddenly all the men found reasons to wander by our table.  The sidelong glares and mutterings became overtly hostile and the ladies would come ""rescue"" their husbands/sons/weird uncles and leave us with very passive aggressive compliments.  

We started nipping on her flask and were trying desperately to not possibly ruin it for the bride.  This was weird but we love her.  We dipped out before they formed a lynch mob and went partying down town Seattle.    

Turned out ok.

3316,"Got sued about 12 years ago by the RIAA for illegally downloading music. Started with a vague cease-and-desist type letter that we took to a lawyer. The lawyer told us to use it as toilet paper. We did exactly that, and next thing I know, my family (internet was in my dad's name, I was about 15 at the time) is being sued.

The RIAA was demanding $750 per song, to the tune of roughly $250,000. Sent a list of every song on my hard drive they were suing us for, and included a bunch of original songs I had written and recorded with my band. 

They offered a settlement for $2500. We went to a different lawyer, since the first one gave us such stellar advice, and we were told to fight it tooth and nail. Of course, my family listened to the attorney, over my objections, and the case dragged on for about a year and a half, until we finally settled for $7500. 

Attorney's fees and settlement included, all told, it cost us about $20,000 and a promise to never do it again. A couple years later the RIAA stopped suing people for downloading. 0/10, would repeat. 


Edit, because I was at work and just figured this would get buried and didn't bother explaining things properly:

No, I am not with the RIAA. I have a soul. The final settlement was much higher because as someone said below, you don't get to say no to an offer and then go back and say ""pretty please"" and get the same offer, that's not how negotiation works. 

The cease-and-desist letter was not ignored, I stopped downloading music, but didn't realize I was still seeding, and still had p2p clients running in the background. Limewire gave them a look at **everything** on my hard drive which is where the list of MY songs came from, I guess the lawyers just saw mp3 files and didn't care to check if they were actually theirs or not.

They were demanding $750 per song because of damages and to make an example. Just because a song costs 2 bucks on iTunes doesn't mean they're going to sue for that price or anything close to it. 

Yes, the case was actually filed, in federal court, Second Circuit, Eastern District of New York. No, I will not provide a docket number because that would violate privacy and blah blah.

3326,"For my sixth birthday I had some friends over for a BBQ. We were all being rambunctious little boys, running around the garden pretending to shoot each other, wrestling, rolling around etc. My dad was setting up the BBQ and somehow managed to burst the lighter fluid bottle and set fire to his arm. All we saw was my dad suddenly rolling around on the lawn, on fire.

At six years old, my only experience with seeing people on fire was from the A-Team, in which nobody ever actually suffered any serious consequences and burning people were just part of the background scenery. We all just figured my dad was getting *really* in to our make believe games, so we were all just cheering and running around him.

He's hard as nails, so when he had managed to smother the fire he just stood up and said ""Back in a minute, kids"" with a big smile on face and disappeared indoors. My neighbour came over to take care of the BBQ whilst my parents went to the hospital to take care of dad's burns. We all just continued running around shouting and wrestling like little savages."

It was harmless at first, but I could tell he was definitely trying to escalate things. I was single at the time, and he was very good-looking, so I was definitely into the idea, although I couldn't shake the feeling that he looked strangely familiar.

We got into the club, he bought me a drink, we started dancing, and eventually started kissing. Soon after I realized why he looked so familiar: he was my friend's boyfriend. I had never met him in person (the friend and I had gone to school together, and we didn't see each other as frequently as we used to, but we still talked on a regular basis), but I recognized him from facebook pictures, and I knew his name. I pulled away from him, and told him I knew his girlfriend. He started freaking out, claiming he was drunk (he wasn't), and begged me not to tell her. But I had known this girl for years, so I wasn't going to keep this from her.

I called her the next morning to tell her what happened. At first, she was really appreciative, and said she was going to break up with him. But apparently when she confronted him, he spun the whole thing around, and told her that I came on to him, and that I was just pissed that he rejected me.

She believed him. They're still together, and I haven't spoken to her since. "

A couple of years ago I had a warehouse employee who just kept making mistakes.  I sat down with the employee several times to go over procedures to eliminate the mistakes but nothing worked.  Finally, I had to let him go.  I called him into my office on a Friday morning, told him the situation, told him he'd be paid for the day, allowed him to collect his things, walked him to the door and said good bye.

By about lunch time he came back into my office crying, telling me he can't let his wife know he was fired.  I was sympathetic and can assure you that no employer actually likes firing people but he had just made too many mistakes.  I told him so and he left.

At the end of the day he came storming in, screaming how I'm threatened by him and he wasn't going anyplace.  My sympathy was worn away at this point.  His job wasn't exactly difficult and I had gone pretty far out of my way to try and help him do it properly.  I was perfectly kind when I let him go and when he came back.  I told him we're all going home for the weekend and if he didn't leave I was going to call the cops.  That was fine by him and he refused to leave.  I appealed as best I could that getting arrested wasn't going to solve any of his problems but he just kept cursing at me.  Finally I called the cops, they dragged him out of the office, and arrested him. 

The best part though is he later used me as a professional reference."
3363,"Luckily we have finally started to figure some stuff out with bees. 

The EPA finally admitted that a certain pesticide, the most used pesticide in the country iirc, is probably a major cause of CCD (colony collapse disorder), and the decline in it's use should lead to a rebound in their population. 

We also know about the mite problem and can treat it if the keeper is diligent, and I also saw a new invention that will allow been keepers to avoid using mite pesticide to kill the mites in the hive, they'll be able to use sunlight instead. 

It's still a huge issue, but we're on the right track for now. The whole world realized that it would cost billions, if not trillions, of dollars to even *attempt* to replicate what bees do for us for free, and in a perfectly symbiotic way. 

Bees rule.

3444,"Definitely was never really rich, but I would consider my family upper middle class. I had a great childhood, mom, dad, brother, and me. We went on vacation once a year to the beach, parents never hesitated to buy my brother and I things. I was very fortunate until I turned about 14. My mother developed Lupus and got very ill. Along with having diabetes she had to get 4 toes amputated (gangrene, 2 toes on each foot).

I knew then my life was different, mom couldn't work anymore and dad worked all the time, really pulling through for the family. He was simply amazing, the way he took charge out of the situation, took care of my mom like a fucking queen. Amazing. 

When I was 16, I lost my dad to a car accident very abruptly. He left for work one morning and never came back. Only thing that did were two police officers knocking down our door telling us my dad is dead. When my mom got sick, I knew things would be different, but this just really topped it for me. We literally had no idea what to do. My dad failed to get life insurance, so he left us with nothing to work with except the money that was already in the bank. Considering my mom can't work and I'm still in high school and my brother is about to graduate high school, it was a pretty helpless situation. 

I got a job and my license right away and started working. Brother moved to college (about 45 minutes away). During this time our house was being foreclosed on because we just simply couldn't afford it. The mortgage company sent us an eviction notice to get out of the house in 14 days. We had to find somewhere to live in 14 days. Holy shit. By the grace of God we found a place about 30 minutes away from where we lived, so that was great for me. I was ready to start new and get out of that house. The memories were too strong for me there and made living very hard for me. It was hard to move on from everything that went on being that constant reminders were everywhere. 

The place was tinnnnmnnnnnny. Not like our old house, but honestly at this point I was so fucking grateful to have anything. This house was a piece of shit though, holes in the ceiling, from repairs he never finished, stuff like that. It was a hole but it was our hole. We would make it work. 

Lived there for two years. It was terrible. I tried my hardest to make it a happy home but there was just no way. I lost my mom during all of this (mentally). She was not the same person which made living there with her hard. During the hardest days, our only car got repossessed. I remember specifically that this must be a joke. Laughing hysterically turned into heart wrenching sobbing. It was too real. I had to quit my job and find one close to home where I could walk to since we have no car and can't see getting one anytime soon (no public transit where I was living which sucked). I did that, and it was all actually working out fine. The grocery store was right by my work which was great. 

February 14, 2012 we received a letter in the mail from our landlord. Never liked the guy and knew this was not good considering how our life is haha. We were prepared. Mom read it and landlord told us we need to move because he was tearing down our house along with a few neighbors to build a new housing development. We were so done with life guys. We had no idea what to do. No place around us were in our price range, we were genuinely stuck. 

Very long story short, we actually moved BACK to our original house, the house I grew up in. The house that was put up for foreclosure. Not really sure how my mom did it (tbh I was very depressed, she was smart not sharing these details with me because I really don't think I could have mentally handled it).

Since then, things haven't really gotten better or worse. Brother moved back home and is helping with things, I'm working at the same place, I did get a 2015 Honda Civic which was HUGE for us! From here, only way to go is up. Mom ran into more health issues (100% blocked aorta) and needs major surgery soon. I'm trying to mentally prepare for the worst but I'm just taking one day at a time. My depression is so very real and I'm finally taking steps to improve myself. 

What I've learned is that money really does control a lot of the things you do, but it's your choice to be happy with what you have. I'm very happy right now, considering, and I really wouldn't trade my experiences for the world because I feel like I can honestly conquer anything I set my mind to. It's just getting there that's hard for me.

3450,"I went through a phase of depression in my late college years and can attest to the altered behavior of being alone a lot. 

I was fairly outgoing before, went out every weekend with friends/roommates, was on the school paper, pretty active all around. 

When I started spending stretches of days entirely alone, it almost felt like what I imagine Aspergers or autism feels like (no offense to people that are actually diagnosed). 

I had a harder time gauging small social cues, appropriate/inappropriateness of things etc., granted this was possibly exacerbated by constantly smoking weed at the time, as well. I just generally felt off and anxious around people that I had previously been close with. 

Luckily, I pulled myself out of the tailspin and am happily married and have an active social life. 

Remember that humans are social creatures, it's okay to be introverted but spending too much time alone can definitely be harmful to mental wellbeing.  "

3452,"On a family trip when I was 12, I saw my step dad fall off a cliff at a state park. We weren't climbing, rappelling or hiking, just walking around. He stepped on some wet moss, lost his footing, rolled to the edge of the slightly sloped cliff and rolled off, falling at least 60'. The paramedics said the fall didn't kill him initially because he landed in a very shallow stream. He never lost consciousness and didn't appear to have a head injury, however spinal damage was immediately evident because he had no feeling below the waist. We were in the middle of nowhere so it took a long time for an ambulance to get there - this was early 80s so no cell phones. He was taken to the nearest regional trauma center which was at least an hour away from where we were, then flown to a metropolitan area where he had emergency surgery to try to reduce damage to spine. He died of a pulmonary embolism 8 days after the fall. He and my mom had only been married for 6 months on the day he fell."
3453,"&gt;When you came, you said to me as follows : “I will give Gimil-Sin (when he comes) fine quality copper ingots.” You left then but you did not do what you promised me. You put ingots which were not good before my messenger (Sit-Sin) and said: “If you want to take them, take them; if you do not want to take them, go away!”

&gt;What do you take me for, that you treat somebody like me with such contempt? I have sent as messengers gentlemen like ourselves to collect the bag with my money (deposited with you) but you have treated me with contempt by sending them back to me empty-handed several times, and that through enemy territory. Is there anyone among the merchants who trade with Telmun who has treated me in this way? You alone treat my messenger with contempt! On account of that one (trifling) mina of silver which I owe(?) you, you feel free to speak in such a way, while I have given to the palace on your behalf 1,080 pounds of copper, and umi-abum has likewise given 1,080 pounds of copper, apart from what we both have had written on a sealed tablet to be kept in the temple of Samas.

&gt;How have you treated me for that copper? You have withheld my money bag from me in enemy territory; it is now up to you to restore (my money) to me in full.

&gt;Take cognizance that (from now on) I will not accept here any copper from you that is not of fine quality. I shall (from now on) select and take the ingots individually in my own yard, and I shall exercise against you my right of rejection because you have treated me with contempt."

The exact purpose of the different railroad gauge was to make it difficult for invading forces to use their own rolling stock on Russian railroads.

It wasn't a big secret. It did not catch the Germans unprepared. I'm sure it was annoying, and did cause delays. But these delays would be factored into the planning of any Russian operation.

What caught the Germans off guard was the Russians will to resist. They assumed they soviets would capitulate quickly in the face of a blitzkrieg. They had planned their invasion to be finished by the time fall and winter turned the roads into mid and ice."

Imagine all the air is moving east to west, like it's a spinning top. This creates two points, one at each the north and south pole. Now, on a straight line between the poles (a meridian), move the poles toward eachother a little bit. The lines the wind follows look kind of like the lines on a croissant if the poles were the points. Keep moving the poles together until they reach eachother at the equator, and you only have one point where there's a cowlick. "

3487,"I have a African grey so he probably doesn't count, but when he wants to be can be a vindictive little shit.

When I was first taking him home (he was originally my mom's) I was also driving my sister home, she had just had jaw surgery so she was on meds that gave her motion sickness. So I get the bird in his travel cage and wrap it in a towel, then get my sister in, and both of them are being irritable little shits so about ten minutes into the drive my sister reaches back and smacks the side of his travel cage to shut him up.

About and hour later, sister gets sick. I pull over, she darts out of the car, Jojo fucking starts laughing. His cage is still wrapped so the first time I assume it's just his response to us stopping because how could he know she's sick?

She got sick five times that drive and he laughed at her every time. With my mother's laugh.

He also used to have a habit of calling the dogs by name, mimicking the fire alarm to make them howl, howling with them to keep them going, then laughing at my mom when she came up the stairs to shut them up. (Now he mostly just sings to me and asks for cheese he's mellowed out a lot)"

3498,"Old person story time!

TxDoT, or the Texas Department of Transportation, once spent a significant amount of money asking a software company to design a hand-eye coordination test specifically for the purpose of excluding people from maintaining a drivers license if they couldn't pass the test. Unofficially, this was designed with old people in mind. On paper, and in official statements, it was designed simply for public safety and to detect the occasional person who lacked the appropriate coordination to drive a car.

The test used a mouse and a monitor and asked people to follow moving icons on the screen with the mouse. Old people suck at computers in general, but they were given plenty of time to practice using the mouse and understanding how it worked. The test was very much designed to eliminate ""I don't understand this computer"" issues and targeted instead towards ""I lack the ability to connect what my eyes are seeing with what my hands are doing.""

In the end, so many elderly people failed the test that they had to scrap it. They tried adjusting the scoring so fewer people would fail, but the people failing weren't just *kinda* failing it, they were totally bombing. The guy who told me about working on this project said they would get distracted, forget what they were doing, lose track of slow moving items on the screen, etc. He said it was just horrifying.

In the end, TxDoT knew they couldn't take driving away from all these people, and couldn't figure out how to use the study's results in a meaningful way. So they just scrapped the whole project.

Every time I pick up my phone to answer a text while I'm driving, remembering this study helps me put my phone down and focus on not getting killed by an elderly person."

Edit: Since this got so much attention. I was born a drunk baby and no eardrums and was catatonic for a year. Infants develop in a sort of programmed way as the brain regions go. By the time I received eardrums through tympanoplasty, (eardrum implants made of a vein and skin graft), my brain at 7 years of age had already developed and hearing fitted in wherever it could fit. Normal hearing is processed near the opposite ear. Mine is all over in patches according to FMRI scans and my hearing is sort of pixelated, if that makes sense. I also don't have a natural hearing trigger and always miss the first few words.   
  At 57 I'm good at dealing with it, but at 7 the noise was quite terrifying and therapy wasn't really a thing. I was Baby Doe in the newspapers since microsurgery was sensational back then. I wore hearing protection for over a year.

Edit// [This](http://youtu.be/cRj0lymMMGs) is the one, the diver's name was Yuri Lipski.

Edit 2// A bit more info from Wikipedia:
&gt;Yuri Lipski, an Israeli-Russian diving instructor, died at just over 300 feet underwater. At this depth, the body is subject to nitrogen narcosis, which can play havoc on the mind by inducing overconfidence, euphoria, hallucinations, confusion, and impaired judgment. It didn't help that Lipski had just one tank full of air — technical divers are better served by multiple tanks filled with trimix, a combination of oxygen, nitrogen, and helium that reduces narcosis. When a diver went to retrieve Lipski's body at the request of his parents, he made an unnerving discovery: the footage captured by Lipski's helmet camera was still intact. The doomed diver had recorded his own death. Lipski's final moments are now on YouTube. Titled ""Fatal Diving Accident Caught On Tape,"" the six-minute video has garnered over eight million views. Though his face is never visible, his distress is palpable and haunting — what starts as a routine dive deteriorates into panicked thrashing as he becomes more disoriented. Clouds of kicked-up sand billow into view as Lipski's breathing rate doubles. In the end, he removes the breathing apparatus from his mouth and the frame goes still."

3588," I prescribe and support generic medications but unfortunately this comment is simply not true.  Let's talk about why. 

 When a generic drug manufacturer makes the name-brand drug,  in most cases it synthesizes the exact same molecule. In that respect, the generic in the name-brand are identical. However  there is more to a drug than just the active ingredient. The rest of the pill, described here as ""the formulation"" is also very important. The formulation controls how quickly the drug is released, where in the body of the drug is released, how stable the molecule is when it sits on the shelf,  and other important parameters about how the drug actually works.  Generic drug manufacturers simply do not have the human or financial resources necessary to reproduce the research necessary to replicate the original formulation. As you can imagine,  two drugs with different formulations behave differently. 

 You say that the law requires the name-brand and the generic drug to have the same efficacy. That may be true, I am no legal expert.  However I can assure you that the law is not being enforced.  For a generic drug manufacturer to show equivalent efficacy, they would have to do a trial in humans. To demonstrate small but clinically significant differences, this trial would have to be rather large. Such a large and expensive trial  would be prohibitively expensive for generic drug manufacturers. They simply don't do it. 

Hopefully by now I've convinced you that theoretically there could be a difference. Unfortunately the problem isn't just  theoretical. There've been clinically significant observed differences in psychiatric medications and probably other medications I'm simply not aware of. 

I wish I could direct you to a resource that tells you which namebrand medications are worthwhile, however one simply doesn't exist. My point is simply the generic medications are not always the same as their name brand counterparts."

3593,"I was possibly the only person attending this wedding who knew both the bride and groom well, because the two families did not move in the same social circles.  Possibly, they were not from the same planet.  Let's call the happy-ish couple Sandy and Danny.

The ceremony was held in a prefabricated church like a giant multi-story tool shed out in the middle of a dirt field.  They'd paid for the building, but didn't pay to have the grounds re-turfed afterwards, saying ""God will provide.""  (Spoiler:  God didn't.)  Sandy's uncle was the pastor.  

The wedding started very late, because we were waiting for the groom to arrive.  Murmurs about Sandy being ditched at the altar began to circulate. and knowing Danny, that wasn't entirely out of the question.  Two of Sandy's young cousins went to the front of the church, with an acoustic guitar and a clarinet, and began performing ""inspired"" music.  From the back of the church a repetitive sound comes.  It's Sandy, with the worst case of hiccups ever.  They're loud.  They throw off the already dubious rhythm of her performing cousins.

Some minutes... long, long minutes later, there's a bit of a commotion at the side door.  It's Danny.  He's somewhat disheveled, and missing his tie and shoes.  He's also missing his best man, who was *his* uncle, and was responsible for gettin' him to the church on time.  To do that, Dannyuncle chose a Z28 with muffler issues and stolen license plates.  Dannyuncle also had numerous outstanding warrants, in multiple states, and half a gram of cocaine hidden in his shoe. Some kind of divine providence may have been involved, because they did let Danny go, but now he was missing a best man.  After a quick conference, one of his brothers was drafted.

Meanwhile, Sandy's attendants and family had been pouring water down her throat, holding a paper bag to her face, and jumping out at her from around corners, to no avail.  She hicced her way through the entire ceremony.  And Danny had to pretend to put the ring on her finger, because that was seized along with Dannyuncle and his coke.  Sandy's aunt played the piano.  It was clear where the cousins got their musical abilities from.

Then there was the reception, held in a side room in the giant metal barn.  There was, of course, no alcohol, and also no catering.  We were handed a Dixie cup with a mixture of those pastel colored candies in them that taste like mint chalk, and peanuts.  There was a cake.  It was vivid purple.  There was also punch, made by combining 7-Up and pineapple juice with Black Walnut ice cream, to make it purple too.  (Pro Tip:  Black Walnut ice cream does not make punch purple, it makes punch gray.)

Sometime during the ""reception"", Danny's brothers and their friends disappeared.  What they were up to, other than imbibing copious amounts of assorted intoxicating substances, became apparent when the hastily borrowed car (since the Z28 had been impounded) came around the corner.  It was covered by brightly colored inflated objects.  Sandy's Aunt Pastor's Wife was heard to exclaim: ""Balloons.  How nice.""

They weren't balloons.  As the car came closer it became apparent that they were novelty condoms, in many fanciful shapes and colors.  One of the cousins asked what the funny balloons were, and immediately had their eyes covered by a nearby adult.  As Sandy and Danny drove off into the sunset, one enormous hot pink studded and ribbed condom bounced across the mud, and towards the church doors.

The reason love is impossible to explain is it is one of the most ambiguous words in modern English.

""I love you.""

Like a father?  Like a lover?  Like a husband?  Like a best friend?  Like a person loves their new car?  Like you love a good shit?

When people say the word ""love"", they usually mean one or more of the following:

* Respect
* Care
* Joy/adoration
* Desire (sexual and non-sexual)
* Curiosity/Fascination
* Appreciation

It doesn't help that 9/10 Clear Channel songs and 3/4 Hollywood films are built on the principle of re-defining love for confused teenagers.  Love is not complicated, but the WORD!  The word is a fucking nightmare."

It's not a lot, but it's enough to at least ask some questions, but then she gets an email from a person she doesn't recognize.

Well, it turns out that these people were cheating, and they did it by having someone text them pictures of the answers. That's not the best part, though. The person who sent them the answers wasn't even in the same classroom, or the same country, even. They had payed a guy in India to take the test for them. They take a picture of the exam, he sends them the worked-out answers. But that's still not the best part.

I think i understand why though, we study bullshit, non important info that can be googled but you have to memorize it even though you're going to forget it in a few days, yeah nobody will spend 30 hours memorizing exact copy of 50 pages when only 5 pages might have useful info. And there's never a question on an exam like ""here's a problem, find a way to solve it"", nope, every question is ""write about x"" or ""here's a problem, use the exact method we taught you 2 weeks ago to solve it"".
Basically schools here don't make sure you understand things, they just make sure you can memorize it for a few days.
Then we had a class that uses old books about microsoft products, some html, a bit of scripting but here's a catch, you never get to work on those programs on a computer! You just memorize the book and write that on the exam! Most of the people don't know how to even use those programs as a result. I had a better class in high school where we were actually taught how to do thing on computers..  Oh and the great and mighty geography class that's about.. our country. Basically memorize history and geo data about your country. As if that can't be googled in a second and plus, we already had geo in primary school..

This is why i'm thinking of working for a while and getting a degree elsewhere. When i see here on reddit that other people do projects in university, like projects that take WEEKS!

All we do here is memorize things and then once in a blue moon we have to google info about some subject and write about it, doesn't take more than a few hours though.

My wife and I gave birth to what we believed was a perfectly healthy baby boy. About 9 hours later, the nurse though he looked odd so she took him to the doctor for a look. Within 5 minutes we saw him with a breathing tube down his throat and hooked to a ventilator. An hour later, we had a doctor sit us down and say he was born with half a heart, and we could either subject him to a series of risky open-heart surgeries spanning the first 5 years of his life, or we could take him home and keep him comfortable while he slowly asphyxiated. We of course chose the surgeries, but the 10 minutes after the doctor left us to our thoughts are the darkest minutes of my life, bar none. 3 hours after the diagnosis, we were in a different hospital and a surgeon was telling us our son had a 50/50 shot of surviving his first procedure: a non-open chest surgery to open a hole in his heart to stabilize him for the first major reconstruction in 7 days. An hour later, we hear a code blue (flatlining) called for the cath lab (where our son was) called over the loudspeaker. This was the second darkest period of my life. The surgeon returned and said his heart was failing and they needed to open him up now. The odds were now... Less than 50%. 

He survived the surgery, but because of the massive trauma to his heart and chest cavity, they needed to leave his chest open to let the swelling subside. A translucent sticker covered the opening, but we were able to see our sons heart beating through the hole in his chest.

2 more open heart surgeries later, our son is a happy 9 month old who is crawling and babbling. He has at least one more surgery, and he will never be cured, but he has a chance at a normal life and that's all we could ever ask."

3733,"My son took an interest in origami a few years ago. I decided to teach myself a few folds so I could help him understand some of the instructions he was reading (it's always fun when ""beginner"" books tell you ""start a square base"" but never explains what that is).

Shortly after I learned to fold cranes, I realized something: post-it notes are square and they're made of good stock for folding. You just have to learn to work with the sticky bits. Now any time I'm stuck sitting at a desk waiting on a computer to finish something (IT guy) I grab a post-it and start folding. Most people ask to keep them if they see me do it. I've left hundreds of post-it cranes in offices everywhere I've been. So, benefits of origami:

1) It helped me do something with my kid.

2) It gives my ADHD brain something to do while I wait on progress bars to fill up without getting sucked into twenty minutes of smartphone tapping.

3) The satisfaction of learning to do something and then continuing to do it until you really learn to do it *well*. There's a big difference between your twentieth crane and your two-hundredth crane.

4) For someone who is moderately socially awkward, it's a powerful ice breaker so long as you don't sound all Rainman when people engage you about it.

5) I work in a competitive field where it pays for customers to have a personal connection to you beyond just ""he fixed my computer"". That minute or so they watched me fold that crane and then the couple of minutes we chatted about why I do it when they inevitably asked me about it means I stand out in their minds. I'm not just the computer guy; I'm the computer guy who has grade school aged sons and can turn a post-it note into a neat conversation piece on their desk."

3797,"As Dave Bowman approaches the Monolith in his little space pod, the Monolith turns into a wormhole and sucks him into another dimension/universe where the aliens that built the Monolith reside.  The flashy lights and creepy choir is Kubrick's attempt using 1960's pre-CGI special effects to capture the idea of what traversing a wormhole would be like.  Dave's weird faces is showing him stunned and in a state of shock at experiencing something he never experienced before.  It's notable to mention that in the book, the plot ends here, with Dave's last transmission back to Earth being, ""My God, it's filled with stars!""

The next scene shows Dave's arrival... in a room.  This room is the alien's best attempt at creating an environment suitable for him to live in, based on imperfect memories of his old residence on Earth.  That's why the room looks kind of off; light comes from the floor instead of light fixtures, the apartment is sparsely decorated, etc.

The next sequence attempts to explain that *time has no meaning* in the universe that Dave is now in.  Dave spends the rest of his life trapped in this little ""apartment"" the aliens created for him, but because time flows differently here, it all happens in an instant:  He watches himself grow older, *and* he is that older person at the same moment in time.

Finally, Dave is a very old man, on his death bed.  He looks up, and sees himself *reborn* as the ""star child"", the alien's chosen ambassador to humanity (as seen in the sequel 2010 and later).  Dave the Star Child then looks down upon Earth, looking at his children, his wards.  The End."

3820,"Martha hated him specifically because of his attacks on George — calling him a monarchist bent on destroying the rule of the people and a senile follower of Alexander Hamilton and his policies. After GW's death, Jefferson said he felt that the ""republican spirit"" of the nation might revive now that the Federalists couldn't hide behind Washington's image anymore, and even refused to attend his funeral.

However, T.Jeffs was kind of an annoying prat in general. A very intelligent prat, but an annoying one nonetheless. He was involved in both America and France's declarations of independence but conveniently buggered off before he could get involved in either war; was obsessed with mac and cheese to the point that he designed a ""macaroni machine"" and imported parmesan cheese because he was convinced it was impossible to recreate it without the milk of Italian cows; frequently conducted presidential business in his pyjamas*; and he was in debt most of his life because he lived far beyond his means. He was also considerable hypocrite (""We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal"" -&gt; owned 600+ slaves during his life; ""I never considered a difference of opinion in politics, in religion, in philosophy, as cause for withdrawing from a friendship"" -&gt; literally did that exact thing to George Washington) and totally shafted Sally Hemings and their probable children, but I don't think many people at the time would've been too worried about that aside from maybe getting annoyed if his hypocrisy was a regular thing.

He's interesting to read about and influenced the modern world a lot — but Jesus, if I knew the dude in real life, I probably would've punched him in the nose. I'd still like to.

*It's worth noting that he was considered a ""man of the people"" due to this, but I'm sure there were a few that just thought him lazy for it ~~cough probably Hamilton cough.~~

3858,"When I was in college, I went to a restaurant with family. This was during Spring Break; we were on vacation at Smokey Mountains in TN and had just stopped to eat dinner. Shortly after we were seated, I noticed a guy sitting by the front (where the waiters had a table with menus), and I had a bad gut feeling about this guy. He was facing us and I noticed him glancing at us every now and then. Awhile later I noticed a waiter bringing him a box of food, but he stayed and just sat there, expressionless, and looking at us sometimes. Anyway I decided to keep an eye on him. The service was really slow and we ended up staying for about two hours. It was odd that this guy also stayed, because he got his food much earlier. Finally we left the restaurant, and as we walked to the door, he got up and exited too! Then I noticed him getting into the car right next to ours - he was driving a large SUV or truck with tinted windows - and he started following us! I told my father, who was driving, and he made several u-turns to be sure. Yep, this guy was following us. So my father turned onto a busy road, and after a few turns we lost the guy. It was very strange and scary - I have no idea why he'd want to follow us. But my gut feeling alerted me and maybe we got out of bad situation."

John Oliver interviewed a bunch of people who remember those ""better times"" when ""America was great"".  

First, he interviews an ad exec who created a Coca-Cola commercial during the 1970s.  He admits that it wasn't the greatest time.  1979 saw gas shortages.  John Oliver says that most people remember the **[Mean Joe Greene commercial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xffOCZYX6F8)**  

Then, he talks a woman about how great the 1960s were... unless you were a woman or a minority.  It was a simpler time... of botched abortions and horrible rape policies.

He talks to a PR man about the 1950s - the threat of nuclear war and communists made it terrible.

Next, a black man explains that the segregated 1940s were not when America was great, either.

A very old woman discussing the 1930s says it wasn't the best era, either.  People were poor; she had to drop out of high school to make ends meet and the games they played were very simple and born out of having almost nothing.

So, when was the better, simpler time that political pundits and presidential candidates speak of?

John Oliver gathers up clips of Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, and Bill O'Reilly and sees a common thread in their nostalgia:

**When I was a kid...**

They were all CHILDREN!  

It was a better, simpler time when you were six years old.  It's less complicated and scary.  "

3892,"Growing up, I would visit my Oma and Opa in Germany every summer, and he never ever spoke about the War. All that I had ever known about him was that he was part of a Panzer (tank) detachment in the Western front and then during Operation Barbarossa, his tank had gotten hit and exploded with him and his crew inside it in 1941, and he managed to get them out while engulfed in flames. When I was young and would go on walks in town with my Opa, people would always stare at him because of his [extensive burn scars](http://imgur.com/ePYBmXI) and I would get defensive on his behalf, but he would tell me that it's natural to be curious of someone's appearance but you should try to get to know who they are first.

After he passed away in 2012, facts about who my Opa was came to light and completely floored me. At his funeral, there were about twenty people that showed up who I had never seen before. It turns out that they were the family of his childhood best friend who was Jewish. In 1938, after Kristallnacht destroyed the town's synagogue and businesses, my 17 year old Opa convinced his grandfather - the town banker - to get his best friend's family out of the country. Unfortunately, my great great grandfather got arrested by the Gestapo and died in captivity for doing so. On top of that, my Opa's best friend never spoke to him again after relocating to Chicago because he was in the Wehrmacht during WWII. The funeral was the first time his relatives had acknowledged what my Opa had done for them and was extremely humbling.

I'm in the US Army and my family decided to present me with my [Opa's medals he earned during WWII](http://imgur.com/a/ywUdA) after he passed away. After learning what some of the requirements are to earn those, I understand why he would never speak about the War. To summarize what you're looking at:

* Pin in the 8th picture is for being wounded three of four times in combat
* Pin in the 10th picture is the Close Combat Clasp in silver - for fighting 25 battles in hand-to-hand combat (to give you an idea of how ridiculous that is, 9500 were awarded in the entire war... and over 20 million soldiers fought for Germany)
* 11th and 12th photos are the German Cross for repeated acts of bravery in combat
* Iron Cross 1st Class for bravery on the battlefield
* Two badges in the 15th photo Tank Destruction badges each for single handedly destroying a tank with a handheld weapon

Basically, to answer your question, my grandfather was like the millions of other soldiers drafted into World War II. It didn't matter what his beliefs were, who his friends were, or if he believed in the cause. His country needed him, and he served - only on the losing side. He held no ill-will towards soldiers or countries that he fought, and was proud of me for serving in the US military sixty-five years after he had fought allied powers in World War II.

3928,"Evening wedding in april. After the ceremony the guests were supposed to have a cocktail hour in the resort's seaside serenity garden while the wedding party got their pictures taken inside the reception hall. Only, the party decided to get wasted and have their own private party. After nearly three hours they still weren't ready to let the guests in. The seaside garden was literally beside the beach, and at night that ocean breeze gets frigid.  Being April, it also began to drizzle.  Mingling was expected,  so no chairs at all, and both the food and drinks ran out after two hours. The bride's family was big in society circles,  so there were quite a few very important local personages in very expensive formal wear sitting on rocks,  planters, and the ground. Members of the party kept coming out to brag about how drunk they were getting inside. 

Once we got inside and finally seated, we realized the bride's family had put the dad's business associates up front, her friends in the center, and the groom's blue collar family and friends in the very back. The wedding party kept disappearing to continue taking shots together. 

By the time dinner was done it was obvious the guests were over it. Speeches had not yet been made, cake had not been cut, dancing not yet started, and the wedding party took off again. One couple announced they had a sitter waiting and walked out. That started an exodus, so by the time the speeches and cake cutting started a good chunk of the guests had left.  The father of the bride was absolutely furious at the wedding party for humiliating him by running off the guests."

There are also lots of vocational programs that are a good ""in between"" that prepare you for a skilled position at a small fraction of the cost of a college degree. I see skilled labor as the backbone of a strong economy and it is rapidly being outsourced overseas because kids seem to think that they are above working blue collar. They instead bury themselves in debt, then are shocked when their business degree doesn't instantly get them a job. We need more mechanics, carpenters, welders, plumbers, painters, rough necks, landscapers, miners, and factory workers just to name a few. A degree is great for some people, but if everyone has one it becomes watered down. Learn a trade and get your hands dirty, it's more fun anyway.

**The Brostitution**

1) You must always have your bro’s back. No exceptions.

2) When your bro’s girlfriend inquires about his whereabouts you know nothing, always.

3) You are only obligated to wingman for one bro per social event; after that, the bro is on his own.

4) When a bro designates you as his wingman, you may not fail him. This is the most important role a bro may play for a bro. It is not be violated or debauched.

5) You must always do whatever is in your power to stop a bro from soiling himself with a poor looking girl—unless the bro is able to stand up, look you in the eye, and articulate that he is to a decent extent sober. Then you are absolved of any responsibility.

6) When a bro pays for all the alcohol for an occasion himself, this must be made known to all present and made out to be the greatest feat ever observed in human history. A bro may skip out on kicking in for beer if he has done this recently.

7) A bro must always respect another bro’s car, house, and parents.

8) Love thy father and mother. A bro will never ever get with a bro’s biological mother or sister. Stepsisters and stepmothers are fair game. This article is subject to the All's Fair Clause.

9) When a bro is showing his bro’s his new ride, he is always required to open the hood and showcase the contents. All bros present are required to admire the content, even and especially if they know nothing about cars.

10) When a bro asks a bro what he thinks of his girlfriend or date, a bro is always required to give an honest answer. The phrase, “I’d bang her” is off limits.

11) A bro will never ever leave his bros without a ride. A bro must never be allowed to walk alone more than 2 blocks.

12) A bro will never ask for gas money for a ride unless he truly is hard up, or the ride exceeds a distance of 20 miles.

13) When gas money for a ride is offered, it may be accepted. Use your own bro-judgment to determine if you should accept.

14) A bro shall never make another bro ashamed for hooking up with a girl. Even if she was truly nasty, a bro will make excuses for his bro. Example, “you were drunk so…”

15) If a bro is terrible at sports, excuses may be made, no matter how bad they are. Good bros will start to play worse so that their bro doesn’t look so bad. This clause is subject to nullification by extreme competition.

16) A bro will never make another bro look bad in front of a target girl. Any such attempts should be swiftly punished by the designated wingman. Afterwards, the bro who infringed upon this rule may be confronted by the whole circle of bros.

17) A bro will always ask around before taking the last of anything. If a bro should ask you if its alright, unless the need is great or direct ownership is applied, you will let him have it. Common courtesy and the bro code go hand in hand.

18) A chick may be included in the bro code if she has proven herself worthy via general bro concession.

19) A chick may never be informed of the sacred rules of the bro code. A chick may be treated as a bro but never told of the rules. When reprimanding a girl for an infringement of the bro code, say “its just common courtesy.”

20) A bro will never let another bro drive drunk. Space must always be found or made for a drunk bro who needs to leave. If necessary, the theft of phone and keys shall be done for his own good. ~~(exception: a designated group drunk driver exists, this bro has mastered the art of driving under the influence and has proven his worth)~~

21) A bro will never allow another bro to drunk dial or txt a girl. No exceptions to this rule. When a bro is truly smashed and his girl calls, the phone will be confiscated until a sober state of mind is achieved.

22) If a bro’s girlfriend calls you and asks about a bros actions the previous night, (I.e. the bro claimed to be sleeping at a friend’s house) you will always claim that yes he was there and you may even claim he is still there. Studies show that 8 out of 10 bros will do this without thinking. The other 2 bros claimed he was still with them but unavailable to talk.

23) You will always make excuses for a bros actions, no matter how obscene. All things done by a drunk bro must be forgiven. No exceptions.

24) A bro should always be allowed to make amends for his actions.

25) A bro will always give his bro’s girl a ride to wherever, so long as restitutions are made for the action.

26) A bro will never give detail when describing a sexual encounter. Doing so will force your bro to imagine you naked and this is unforgivable.

27) A bro will always do his best to help another bro’s self esteem. The Alpha-Bro should always be handing out the wisdom and power of his skill. A bro will always recognize the master seducer of the group.

28) A bro should never ever under any circumstances sleep with a bro’s ex-girlfriend. A bro may proceed to make moves on another bro’s failed target (he got rejected) but only after asking permission first. If the bro declines your invitation to bust some moves, you must adhere to his wishes and find a new target.

29) If permission for rule 28 has been given by a bro, and success is evident for yourself. One must always put it down to it being the girl’s preference and not due to your superior abilities. If a bro proceeds to become butt-hurt about your success where he failed, you are under no obligations to make him feel better or apologize for your success.

30) A bro will always take care of a bro who is blacked out, throwing up, and incase parents or girlfriend call. If a bro’s parents demand he comes home immediately, one will immediately allow him to use a shower and whatever else is necessary to make sure a bro receives no enemy fire on the home front.

31) A bro will always tell a bro what he did when he was blacked out. No matter how bad.

32) A bro must always maintain a safe physical distance from a bro’s girl, especially when drinking. Physical contact may only be made with a bro’s girl, when saying good bye. No exceptions.

33) A bro will always do his best to stop a bro from getting tattoos. A bro’s skin is the largest organ he has and the second most important. Especially if the tattoo is of a girl. Chicks will dump you and play with your heart, but a bro will protect you like his own private parts.

34) When a promise is made, it shall be kept. And under no circumstances shall it be broken.

35) The way of the bro is sacred, cherish it like a sect or cult. The bro life is like being in Jedi training camp. You must always show your bro love and be joyous when bro love is shown to you.

36) Bro-mance is allowed but only among your tightest bros. Never take your bro-mance too far. And if anyone should remark negatively upon your bro-mance. An immediate beat down should ensue. Should a girl comment negatively upon the bro-mance, kindly explain to her that she will never know love from a man such as you and your bros share. And let her know what a privilege it is to be a mere witness to your glory.

37) The fist bump is a bro’s greatest weapon aside from the bro code itself. It should be used to show support, acceptance, pride, and it is an all around green light for an action that was committed. Use the fist bump often, and show constant appreciation for your bro’s jokes and skills with it.

38) Corollary to rule 37, the denial of a bro’s fist bump is a terribly powerful slap in the face. To deny a fist bump is no light thing, and should only be done when there is very great disapproval of an action.

39) Never refer to a bro by his last name, this is a sign of disrespect. Always refer to a bro by their name, nickname, or any standard bro word.

40) Standard bro names include but are not limited to; bro, dude, man, and anything with bro in it. (example: broham.)

41) Always respect a bro’s viewpoints about anything from politics to cars to religion. The only time a bro’s views do not matter is when they conflict with the bro code. If such a case should happen, the bro should be immediately evicted from the bro circle, until correctional actions have been made.

42) A bro should always treat for food when a bro is broke. Signs that a bro is broke are phrases like, “I’d rather eat at home”, “I’m not hungry”, “I just ate”, and finally “I’m trying to save money so ill eat at home.”

43) Similar to rule 42, when discussing the purchase of party beverages, if a bro declines to offer money. The other bros should cover for him. No bro should be denied thirst quenching goodness just because it’s a tight week or month.

44) A good bro will always encourage his bros to be an Alpha-Bro when it comes to talking to girls. If necessary demonstrations of your prowess may be made to give your bros something to work with.

45) A bro is only allowed to do really stupid things when he is really drunk. A bro may be denied further access to alcohol when it is obvious he has drunk too much already.

46) All things must be forgiven among bros, with the exception being your drunk bro feels up your girlfriend. This allows for an immediate punch to the face, but only after all other bros have been told and are gathered to watch the punishment. Before the blow is delivered, your drunk bro must have the situation explained to him. Because he is drunk, he will probably agree that he needs to be punched.

47) Under no circumstances should a bro ever be hit in the genitals for any reason. Ever.

48) You should only ever make fun of a bro for minor things that don’t affect their physical attributes.

49) The only time that cockblocking is condoned by the bro code is when the designated cockblocker (aka the bombardier) has viable reasons to stop a bro from hooking up with a girl.

50) The Golden bro rule that everyone knows: **Bros over hoes**. This rule may be seasoned to taste by the bros themselves. Example; Bros over hoes except at the close."

She'll only allow us to set the table. It's heart wrenching to see her insist on cleaning up after us. She refuses all help because she wants things to be as they always were. Last dinner (we only do once a month now a days), we all gracefully and politely ate hard Mac and cold cheese because she never turned the oven on. With burnt pork chops which she apologized for being burnt because her hands were to numb to ""get them at the right time"".  One of my cousins has a mental deficiency and one has a t.b.i. (He's missing half of his brain but still functioning, just forgetful to say the least). However, we all knew not to say a damn thing knowing it might be the last Sunday grandkids dinner.  Just a note, grandma can't eat anymore. She survives mostly off protein shakes, baby food, and tea. She will never know that Mac and cheese wasn't cooked.

And if you're wondering why we let her still slave herself over this dinner. Trust me when I say, we've tried our hardest to make dinner for her or ourselves so we can all sit down.

Then she goes back into the kitchen and continues violently insulting her son's wife.

4039,"Tamales

A long time ago we adopted a family in a really bad part of town for Christmas which basically meant we bought them presents and ate dinner with them and whatnot. I enjoyed it.

Anywho. We get to this place and the smell of these tamales is permeating through the house. The only problem is they're really really bad tamales. Like bad husks with bad meat and a bad cream sauce on top. 

So we sit down for dinner, have our 45 minute prayer and start eating. The lady who made them looks so proud of them, I couldn't help but pretend that they were the best goddamn thing I had ever eaten  in my entire life. 

The only thing they had to drink was Sunny Delight, I wondered if the lady saw me cram a giant fork-full in my mouth and then take a huge gulp of sunny-d to keep the gagging at a minimum. 

When we got up to leave, I told her I MUST have one for the road. We drove about 5 minutes out of the bad part of town, I pulled over and yacked up a tamale and sunny delight slushie. I have yet to drink Sunny-D or eat another tamale since. 

Somewhere I have a photo that they took of all of us sitting for dinner, a fake smile plastered on my face with the eyes of someone who is being forced to eat their loved ones bodies.

Good memories. 


**Edit**

Dinner wasn't part of the plan. But they were such awesome people they insisted on cooking for us. It would have been rude to insist on buying food for them when they were trying to show gratitude to us. 

**Edit 2**

People want to talk about the 45 minute prayer thing. The way it goes in a lot of Mexican households during a celebration or large family event is you get around in a circle (or dinner table) and each person prays about something, it can be anything really. Most of the time it's about keeping so and so safe, or giving so and so the strength to do something difficult. It's not typically something that is done before every meal. This was a special occasion, so we all participated. This prayer was 45 minutes, I've been to prayers that lasted several **hours** before you left for a long trip or something else significant.

4075,"I'll be the contrarian here. This was before Facebook, but I have had a very deeply held belief changed by something meme-like. I grew up in the 1990s in a sheltered, exclusively Christian environment, with all the political beliefs and moral conclusions that went with that at the time.  Rush was right, welfare recipients were parasites, feminists were man-haters. I went away to college at a state school, and life happened.  I started having a lot of my views challenged. I remained Christian, though, and for me part of that was believing that embryos were endowed with immortal souls from the moment of conception, making abortion a form of homicide, usually outright murder.

And then one day, I saw a sign on campus posted by an activist group: a coat hanger, and the caption ""Never Again."" Crazy as it sounds, until that moment, I'd never really thought hard about how an abortion ban would play out in real life. I'd just accepted without questioning that ending abortion meant outlawing abortion, and vice versa.  That sign really brought it into focus for me: women got illegal DIY abortions before it was legalized, and would invariably go back to it if it was outlawed. 

It really clicked with me at that point that for most women, abortion is an act of desperation, and desperate people aren't dissuaded by laws when the cops aren't looking. Making abortions amateurish and unsanitary wouldn't help. Even imposing criminal penalties wouldn't help. It convinced me that if I really wanted to see abortion rates drop, then the key was fighting the desperation itself, not piling more on."

4125,"&gt;  keep the cig smoke off of them from her two pack a day indoor habit because I got called to the office in 5th grade because I smelled like I was smoking cigs. I had a chronic cough from her secondhand smoke and it didnt stop her from smoking outside. 

I feel this one so strongly.

Until just over a year ago I'd never told anyone about my childhood and both my parents would smoke like chimneys indoors (40+ a day each) and also wouldn't do laundry or any real looking after of their children so my school clothes would stink of cigarette smoke to the point I'd even get bullied for the smell.

It got so bad I would find a bottle of Febreze and keep it with me to spray my clothes on the way to school everyday to try and not smell so bad.

We didn't have any hot water in the house as my parents wouldn't pay the rent so couldn't ever call the landlord so wasn't able to properly bath as a child / teen.

In my case, it was my Dad who was the addict (an alcoholic) who would spend all the money on alcohol, cigarettes and the bandit in the pub.

My mother would spend what was left on her cigarettes and only then would money be spent on what the family needed and there wasn't usually enough left.

As a child there were times where I'd be trying to do my homework in the dark and cold, huddled under multiple duvets as it's sub-zero and there's no heating or lighting as the bill wasn't paid with just the light of a single candle or small torch to try and do it - then getting shit off a school teacher for maybe not having done it all :(

I now own a successful software business in the UK and no-one would know any of this about me by looking at me.  I was so proud on my University graduation day that I'd managed to achieve what I did given my circumstances.

My dad died young but my mum is alive and refuses to admit how she could have done better in my childhood.  However, she's now had multiple strokes and is living in a home so I go visit and take her out for the day.

She was a shitty parent but, on reflection, I'm pretty sure she has some deep underly mental health issues which she should have sought help for herself before having children and I'd rather move on with life and treat people well even if their past behaviour towards me wasn't so nice.

The only people who know about this in my life is my wife and a social worker who I told when my wife and I were going through our life histories for our BAAF Form F assessment to be approved foster carers in the UK to help young people in need.

It's something I'd tried not to think about for a lot of years and got myself quite upset digging up the past by thinking and talking about it but, having done it once, going back over it here now it's much easier.

Whilst I am mad at my parents for having abused their child in the way they did, I'm also mad at the numbers of professionals child me dealt with who saw the levels of neglect I was in (even during school sports and Doctor visits I was so underweight all my bones stuck through my skin) and not one of them reported their concerns.

Please, if you're a teacher or any professional who deals with a child who things don't ""seem right"" with then report your concerns to your safeguarding officer or to social services / childrens services.

&gt; One of the first acts by the Irish Citizen Army in the Rising was to occupy St Stephen’s Green. However, with so many large buildings overlooking the Green (including the Shelbourne Hotel) and not enough men to occupy a useful number of them, the rebels’ position rapidly become untenable. British forces, particularly from the Shelbourne, swept the Green with gunfire, and the rebels were forced to withdraw to the College of Surgeons.
  
&gt; Nevertheless, things weren’t so bad for the park’s feathered inhabitants. The Times History of the War recorded that St Stephen’s Green “was well stocked with waterfowl, and the keeper, who remained inside all the time, reported that his charges were well looked after and fed by him, and were very little perturbed by the bullets flying over their heads”.
  
&gt;  The park-keeper’s name was James Kearney – every day he would enter the Green to feed the ducks, and every day the opposing sides would cease firing to allow him to do so.

4144,"That's not possible, unfortunately. I don't know how the color blind glasses work, but I do know how our eyes work. 

We see colors because we have 3 types of color receptors in our eyes sensitive to certain wavelengths of light. We have named the colors of those particular wavelengths as red, green, and blue. Everything else just comes from some combination of them (or none, in the case of black). In order to add colors, we would need to have an additional color receptor. 

Fun related fact: there is no wavelength for magenta. It is the combination of red and blue. Normally our eyes interpolate colors, which is why yellow is a combination of red and green (it's in the middle of them) , but the color between red and blue is green. We know that there is no green, though, because our green receptors aren't firing, so basically our brains just made up a color that's a combination of red and blue.

Adding an additional receptor would have a similar effect. Going back to yellow, we cannot currently tell the difference between a yellow light and the combination of red and green light -- they are identical to us. But if we were to add a yellow receptor, then we could tell the difference like described above, and we'd have another invented color for the combination of red and green just like we have magenta. "

He told us stories of frost bite, and angry, ugly German nurses dunking their feet in hot water.  He told stories about being cold, and hungry, and missing home.  One of the only gruesome stories he told me was when he and a two brothers were on foot, being chased through a wooded area by an armored division.  While they were fleeing, one of the brothers was gravely injured.  My Grandpa had to convince a man to leave his dying brother behind to save his own life. In the end he helped the man pull his brother into a ditch before they left, so the tank would not run him over.  When the war ended, Grandpa had to walk home from the Russian front, with nothing but the possessions he carried.  He was taken in by a family in a small town looking for a farm hand.  While working there he met my grandmother.  He saved up some money, and moved to Ohio where an uncle of his lived.  He saved up enough money to bring my grandmother here and marry her.  He is still alive and as healthy as you could be in your mid 90's.  "

I was young, 5-7, somewhere in there. I was sleeping in between my parents for whatever reason. I woke up, I remember the clock reading around 4 a.m. There was something standing by the window, looking out into the front yard. It looked like a man in a brown wool robe, about 6'4"" or so.

I started to stir and sat up in bed, and the thing turned and looked at me. Dear god, that face. Extremely pale white skin, lots of really pronounced wrinkles, and the face drooped like it was melting, down into a really pointy chin, almost similar to a Scream mask but with all of the features of a living being. It's mouth was hanging open and it's eyes were wide, almost like it was worried or frightened. 

It kept it's gaze on me while it moved away from the window, in front of the bed, and out the open bedroom door. The second it exited the room, the lights turned on on their own and both of my parents jumped up on either side of me, breathing heavily like they'd both just woken up from a nightmare. 

To be clear, I was fully able to move during this, I don't think it was sleep paralysis, but i'm not sure what it could have been other than some kind of demon or really fucking ugly ghost. I've never seen it since, but I can still picture it clear as day."

&gt;I really feel bad for Stephen. You can tell the guy's really passionate about the show and his character - and has been since day one. He's genuinely a good guy too, and likes to engage with fans both on social media and in real life. However, just because of some no-life Tumblr basement dwellers who masturbate to shitty romance drama, shit-tier show writers and organic showrunners such as Marc Guggenheim, the show is seeing a huge decline in quality and popularity - deservedly so too - and all his hard work has gone to waste just like that. Everything he poured his soul into. Gone - just like that. It's not his fault and there's not much he can do about it, because no matter how well he acts (and damn does he act well) at the end of the day there's only so much you can do as an actor. Not even the best actors can out-act shitty writing. So for him, it must be like being a ship's captain watching it slowly sink and being helpless to do anything. Sure does suck.
Thankfully he's still quite young so hopefully if they ever make a new Green Arrow show - or even better, a movie - a decade or so down the line, he could get casted as a middle-aged, bearded, Oliver Queen (just like how the character was pre-New 52). I think he deserves it."

Also the problems with Nuclear stations is that they are designed to run at 100% capacity for long periods of time. They are inflexible when it comes to changes in demand.  Once shutdown they take days to run back up to full load due to the complex reactor process. This is why coal and gas stations are essential to maintain the integrity of the grid because they can adjust their load output quickly ( within minutes, rather than hours/days) to meet demand.

4350,"&gt;Cheaper to see a doctor now than go on dialysis. 

I get the logic behind this, I really do, but it's kind of a meaningless sentiment when applied to reality.  Buying a new Kia is cheaper than buying an old Jeep, but what good does that do me if I can't afford a new Kia?  

It costs $100 minimum for the appointment just to see the doctor or nurse who will tell me what doctor or practice I need to visit in order to have my symptoms addressed- and that's WITH health insurance. $100 is a lot of money to me, but nevermind that-  I have to have spent over $6,000 towards medical care before my health insurance pays for *anything*.  That is a **huge** chunk of my income.  An expense of $100 beyond my regular budget means I'm probably going to end up paying some sort of late fee or NSF charge on something else.  $6,000 out of my annual budget would mean I'm homeless and probably lost my kids as well.

So yeah- that pain in my abdomen, you're right, it's probably cheaper for me to see a doctor than potentially be on dialysis. But what if it's just a kidney stone? I spent $400 I didn't have in order to find out, am an additional $2,000 in debt to the radiology lab, and still have a fucking pain in my abdomen because it's ""just"" a kidney stone and I don't belong to the part of society that can afford to do anything about them. 

That's where I'm at, that's where millions of Americans are at, and it fucking sucks bro. "

Seinfeld and Friends (and Frasier, don't forget about that gem of a show) were broadcast in an era where you had to be in your living room at the exact time it aired, otherwise it was gone forever until repeat season.  Personally, I think the DVR has allowed shows to become more story driven simply because the audience can catch up on the plot.

Simple test, go watch a random episode of Seinfeld on TV and try to guess what season it is from, then do the same with a more modern show.. one tends to be easier than the other.  But don't get me wrong, I enjoy both sides of that technological divide."

This new roommate didn't speak English very well, so, my other roommate and I quickly stepped in to explain in her mother tongue, that he was a contractor and not from the cleaning service.

After a long night of hosting a BBQ with friends, he's sitting out in his yard just looking at the stars. The dog was wandering around and he calls her over. She doesn't come at first, but he calls her a few more times and she makes her way over. He reaches down to pet her and notices something off after a moment. Instead of her fluffy, curly fur it was rough. He looks down and realizes he's been calling and petting a raccoon.

He says the raccoon was giving him the look of ""hey man, why'd you stop?"""

He somehow found a way out of his pen, and wandered all the way to the lake. They got home to no iguana. They eventually got a phone call from a neighbour who said he saw Ziggy while out on his boat on the lake.

And a conversation  at one point where she said ""but she look like a guy!"" and I just replied by saying I liked butch girls and walking to my room with my snacks. I was 17.

A year later/7 months ago I went on my first date with my current girlfriend and my mom heard about it through the grapevine and asked why I didn't tell her. I told her I didn't want to make her uncomfortable. She scoffed and said it didn't matter of she was uncomfortable because it was my life and she wanted to know about it. Now she's good about it. Still a little awkward but she's nice to my girlfriend and respects our relationship. She appreciates how much my girlfriend helps me with my anxiety and everything I've been dealing with lately too. She did, however, get extra drunk the first time I slept over at GFs house. So baby steps.

I came out to my mom poorly. I had been at the worst place in my mental health and she discovered a dismantled disposable razor in the garbage and asked if I was self harming. A small part of the reasons I told her for it was that I was that I'm gay and knew she wanted me to be straight. I was right but she came around and our relationship recovered over time."

She was a 22 year old student who went to bed at 9pm and would wake up around 5am (not for work or class, just because it's what she did), read the newspaper and sipped her tea while playing the news on her television.  Nothing was wrong with any of this, it just wasn't the typical 'student' type of behaviour.
And she also had a dog. A little black toy poodle she loved more than her own damn family.

One Friday I was at her place. She went to bed at 9 like usual, but I stayed up to watch a movie. It ended around 11, so I tip-toed into the bedroom and saw the dog was on my pillow. Like any human would, I picked it up and set her in her own bed on the floor. My SO woke up and said, and I quote ""If Bella was sleeping there, then you don't move her. Go sleep on the couch""

She was dead serious. 

I grabbed my stuff I had left there, and went back to my own apartment (with time to catch the end of a party next door). I had a text the next morning from her asking where I was. Went back over and told her we were done.

Note, we hadn't been together long and it wasn't going great anyway. The whole dog thing is what pushed me over the edge to end it all. "
4531,"If a person has multiple x chromosomes, the body actually can handle it pretty well. The machinery used by women to prevent overexpressing x-based genes (X-chromosome inactivation) would just go and silence the 3rd X-chromosome. ~~The only issue I know of is that the person would be sterile, since they couldn't create haploid sex cells.~~

EDIT: Quick correction, sterility isn't due to an inability to produce sex cells.  /u/BavarianBozzz is correct that the incidence of trisomy of the X chromosome occurs quite often. I mixed up and attributed the sterility seen in Turner's syndrome (single X chromosome) with trisomy of the X chromosome.

4572,"White trash step sister planned on getting married in a small chapel on her air force base. Here are some of the highlights-

- The actual chapel was unavailable for some reason on the day of. So the services were hastily shoved into an event room with folding chairs and a makeshift altar. The room barely fit all of the guests, even with some pressed up against the wall in the back.

-My 3 y/o niece, the flower girl, had a terrible cold and was carried down the aisle bawling her eyes out. Halfway through the service she stood up, walked up to where her parents were standing, and tugged on step sister's dress until SS picked her up. It could have been cute if my niece didn't wail every time someone tried to speak

-At the reception SS and her new husband got halfway through their first dance before realizing it was the wrong song, stopped the DJ, spent a few minutes finding the correct song, and started over as if nothing had happened

-Dinner was supposed to be a buffet, but by the time the reception started there were just a bunch of cold appetizers sitting out, and the catering staff hadn't even gotten started with the main course. I heard it took an hour and a half before food started getting served, but I wouldn't know because...

-The wedding started at 7 and ended around 8 maybe 8:30. Remember the 3 y/o flower girl who was sick and cried the whole time? My bio sister and I were supposed to be babysitting her overnight. Half an hour into the reception our step mother passed her off to us and told us to take her back to the hotel room so she could sleep. 

This poor little girl was still crying, now soaked in her own piss, but didn't want to leave because she was so hungry. We found out later that she hadn't eaten since LUNCH at noon. We brought her back to the room and my sister ran out for a pizza while I gave our niece a bath. Sister came back, niece made it through two large slices and started falling asleep. That's when I noticed a small hair ornament pinned just above her ear. When I took it out I realized that the sharp end had been sticking directly into the top of her ear the entire night. She gave the most relieved sigh, said thank you, and immediately fell asleep.

Most of the wedding was just funny because it was so trashy, but the fact that the bride was so narcissistic that she completely neglected her daughter and let that happen really pisses me off."

4641,"In 2010, the Mr. downloaded Hurt Locker.  A few months later we were served with a $3000 fine from a copyright lawyer - no warnings from our provider or anything.  After discussing it with a personal lawyer, it was evident that the legal fees to challenge it would be greater than the fine itself.  All they had to identify us was our ISP address, so we could have argued that it was one of the roommates, or someone else had accessed our wifi, but it would have cost us quite a lot to go to court.  Anyway, Mr. called the copyright folks and plead his case (and our lack of money as new college grads) and they dropped the fine to $2400.  The sad part is, we had never even watched the damn film.  

ETA:  When we did finally watch the movie years later, neither of us were fans. All this trouble for something we'll never watch again.

Edit 2:  Asked the Mr. about this, and he confirmed that a court date was listed in the letter from the copyright lawyers.  Where was the courthouse, you ask?  Washington D.C., very far form where we live.  We very well may have been scammed into paying the fine, but we were young, and couldn't afford legal fees in our own state, much less halfway across the country.  I believe this is why the lawyer we sought out suggested we contact the copyright lawyers directly. 

Edit 3:  Wow, so many comments!  I'll address a couple of the common ones:

1.  As many have pointed out, this was a huge effort by the producers of Hurt Locker to capitalize on loss of revenue due to piracy.  A simple Google search can provide you much more information, but here's one article to get you started.  http://money.cnn.com/2011/06/10/technology/bittorrent_lawsuits/

2. Was it a scam? Depends on how you look at it, but it seemed scammy enough for a judge to throw out the case.  Unfortunately, this was after we had paid up.  Like I said, we were young and naive and didn't know better.  If this situation were to happen today, we'd obviously be more skeptical about it.  At the time, all we had to go on was the advice of the lawyer, so we trusted him.

3.  Okay, I get it.  I'll refer to him as SO from now on. Settle down."

As it is, in two years I'll have a paid-for degree, no student debt, and a decent chance in a good job market and a chance to get my son out of the lower class before he knows he was ever in it.

Even with all that help though, I'm crumbling under the stress of my responsibilities because I refuse to rely solely on what they give us. "

4650,"It's funny because if you carefully watch the last episode of Dexter season 4 it actually makes no sense.  The timeline doesn't work out:

Towards the end of the episode, Trinity is trying to get away from his life by taking his Mustang to a car shop to get it painted.  He drives away from the shop in the daylight, and is seen a short time later driving at night.  Dexter, having apparently removed his oil cap resulting in a breakdown (perfect timing), jumps from the trunk of the car and takes him away.  So we're supposed to believe that Dexter was hiding in the back of the car (with his murder outfit on and his tools with him) *while it was being painted* and no one noticed.  When did Dexter get into the car???  They leave this out because it makes no sense.  Like none at all.

Dexter takes Trinity to his place where he kills him (apparently not worried that there are hundreds of cops looking for him, as if they wouldn't look at Trinity's hideout) during which Trinity mentions ""its already over"" meaning he has already killed Rita.  When did he do this?  He would've had to do it hours ago according to the timeline of the day the show takes place.  This doesn't make sense either though since Rita was last seen being sent away by Dexter in a cab with the baby.  Trinity would've not only needed her to forget something at her home (she conveniently forgets her ID, resulting in the voicemail to Dexter) but remember - *she was taking a cab*.  Taxis wait outside for their fares, so the timeline would've *had to have been* that Rita forgets her ID, tells a cab to go back home, she takes the baby inside, then gets murdered *all while the cab would've been waiting for her to jump in her home and jump out again*, which she didn't do because she was murdered by Trinity during this time.  

But wait, when did the murder take place then?  Watch it again with an eye on the order of events and it honestly makes no sense at all. "

Printing stuff for people was a big part of the business - flyers, business cards, menus, whatever, and sometimes, wedding invitations. It only took a few wedding invitation jobs before we started pricing them about 10 times what we priced normal jobs. Not because wedding invitation paper is especially expensive or it costs more in consumables or requires special wedding invitation printers and wedding invitation layout software - it's because they weren't worth the hassle of dealing with. We priced them comically high hoping they'd go somewhere else and then when they came back because everyone else does the same thing, it was at least high enough that'd we say, ""fine, I guess we'll do it. *[dejected sigh]*""

That's why everything wedding related is so expensive. "

My Mum had helped him achieve that by financially supporting him so he could take on pro bono cases. She kept saying she was fine but she was about an octave too high for anyone to take that seriously and when I said I had met my girlfriend at the LGBTa and she asked what that meant she freaked out as soon as I said the word ""transgender"" and told me to stop talking. 


She had just detoxed from alcohol and she relapsed and was back in hospital within 24 hours of me telling her. I knew she was an addict but I was never able to shake the thought that she was making a statement about my relationship when she picked up the bottle that day. We eventually came to a kind of stalemate on the issue where we didn't really talk about it but every now and again she'd say stuff like ""but you won't be able to have children, will you?"" and I'd politely correct her. You could almost see the internal battle raging behind her eyes whenever I said anything on the topic. She had always believed in gay rights and been pretty liberal but the further her addiction went, the more bigoted things she'd say. 


I would have loved for my partner to have met my mother pre-addiction but I kept them away from each other. It would be a hell of a lot harder to love my mother for who she was before dhe got sick if she had hurt the woman I loved so I compartmentalised them and removed the opportunity completely. She died a few years back and whilst I am sad about it I feel I made the right choice. It wasn't about shame towards either of them, I just didn't want either of them to suffer as a result of interacting with each other.


My stanchy Catholic Grandma (who in many ways felt like the stand-in for my Dad, as she was the only surviving immediate relative from his side of the family), on the other hand, kept telling me she loved me. I told her I was happy to give her some time to absorb the information because I knew it'd be quite a lot to take in... and within 3 hours she was cheerfully chatting about it with another relative (who knew but had been prepared for her to be a little shaken because she was quite frail and was reconciling the news with a prejudiced upbringing). Within 24 hours she was informing me that she wanted pictures of my girlfriend. I wasn't expecting that but I probably should have been because she loved photos and always wanted to know what our partners looked like! She said that my SO had lovely eyes, told me that she didn't even know lesbianism existed until she was 21 and kept telling me how much she loved me and even that she was proud of me. It was one of the most profound and healing experiences of my life.


I guess what I learnt from all that is that the people you love and think you know can always surprise you, for good or bad reasons. That it's OK to draw up distance to protect yourself but doing it pre-emptively can sometimes rob you of profoundly loving experiences from people who don't give a damn about ideology when their relationship with someone they love is in the mix. 


Also, sometimes when people give you a bad reaction, it says far more about what they are going through than their views on homosexuality or you... and that's sad but it's OK as well. If my mother had  recovered and become more herself again, it would have been great to introduce them to each other without addiction being a kind of malevolent third party sucking all the joy from the room. We can only work with the hand we are dealt, though, and I do not regret protecting them from what would have been a disasterous interaction. Be brave, guys, but don't go back into situations if you know they will hurt you.

4792,"Although the internet started getting big during my middle-school years, I didn't really have access to it or use it often until college, so hopefully this counts: 

- Having a glove box full of paper maps/an updated atlas that the passenger in the car would navigate from on road trips.

- Having very few pictures of yourself from your younger years- photos weren't taken unless someone had thought to bring along a camera and film, and not everyone had a camera. There are more photos in existence from one year of my life right now on my facebook profile than there are from the first 20 years of my life. 

- Candid photographs. This one is near and dear to my heart. Photos now are so posed. You take it, everyone looks at it, decides whether or not they like their facial expression, or notice if someone was blinking, ok let's take 4 more. Selfies are the exact same pose, exact same smile, with only a change of background. Group shots are pasted smiles or posed facial expressions and everyone's arms around shoulders. Back in the day you would snap a photo and see how it turned out like 3 weeks later when you got the film developed at Kmart. Even now with digital, if you try to take a photo without anyone noticing, you still have to wait to focus, and invariably *someone* notices and then demands that you retake the shot with everyone now posing. 

- Being able to be dumb and stupid and carefree and sometimes have stupid moments that everyone eventually forgot about because none of it was immortalized on the internet. My friends and I used to wear the most ridiculous clothes, run around wild, get in fights sometimes, get over it, all of it happening live without a permanent record or a public stage. 

- There wasn't a huge comparison as far as looks and clothing went. Trends and styles were usually very specific to a region or even a school, because there was no way to know what people across the country were wearing, or how we were *supposed* to look and dress. I feel like this also resulted in trends lasting much longer than they do now. 

- More reliance and trust placed on/in neighbors and the people around you. Kids used to play outside all day and night, with whoever showed up, usually hopping around from one backyard to the next all over the neighborhood. My parents knew all the other parents in the neighborhood, people relied on each other because they had to. These days it's so easy to be isolated, to not know the people who live 3 houses down from you, for kids to stick to a certain group of friends with pre-planned playdates or get-togethers in a previously-decided-upon location. Parents can text their kids to see where they are and tell them to come home. 

- The final one I can think of, and the one I miss the most: being completely unavailable. If you weren't physically at home, you weren't available. I remember riding my bike around the neighborhood looking for my friends by which bikes were in front of which houses, or later on if a car was in the driveway or not, because no one was answering the phone. If someone wasn't home, you left a message or just talked to them the next day. If you were waiting on a call from a job or something, you would tell your mom or roommate what to tell them. Now we stress if someone doesn't text back in a minute. There's an expectation now that, due to modern technology, we should *always* be available. Back then, you would leave the house, and whatever you were doing, you were *present* while doing it, you know? No texting while having dinner with a friend or stopping what you're doing to answer an email. 

It was a nice time. I miss it. "

4873,"Maybe a bit weird, but Custom Maps in Starcraft. (the first game)

People were creating crazy custom games by creating and modifying tricks with the limited tools. With Warcraft 3 and Starcraft 2, the tools got advanced enough that people have been able to create Space Invaders or First Person Shooters, but how do you do that when you don't have access to modifying the engine or camera?

And that's what I loved about examining the nitty-gritty of those maps.

Triggers with spawning/dying units to simulate energy bars in a map based on the Sims.

Health-modifying and team-changing beacons to allow a Dungeon Master to create entire NPC towns in a DnD map. I've built towering citadels out of stacking flying Command Centers and created frantic escape scenes by queen-mucasing an Ultralisk that slowly stalked after the players in a narrow tunnel.

Dozens of RPGs and several MOBA-styled maps existed.

I've played ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"" and re-lived seasons of DBZ.

There was tag, hide-and-seek, obstacle courses...

All that lack of freedom just squeezed people into asking themselves: ""How do I do X when I can only do Y?"" And they achieved it. And people took those answers and expanded and grew and modified and did more."

The one story I always like to bring up is working with Nickelback. I was told they would be with me for a week and my first reaction was ""great, just what I needed on my resume /s."" I won't leave you all in suspense. They were by far my favorite band to ever work with. Usually in every band, there is one guy who is a total dick hole. First, the drummer shows up. He starts setting up his kit and is just the nicest dude. He asks me all sorts of questions about my life and shows a genuine interest in who I am as a person. One by one, the rest of the band rolls in each one as nice or nicer than the last. I used to play in a shitty metal band and every one of the guys is into metal and we have a great convo about music in general. Finally the whole band is there but Chad, so I think, well he's the one then. He's the dick. Chad finally comes strolling in and he's the nicest one of them all. They're all Canadian and the Stanley Cup finals are on. They just wanna drink beer and hang out and make music. At one point, Chad even does an impression of Patton Oswalt doing an impression of him, which by the way, was spot on. They laugh at people making fun of them because well, they are making music for a living and having a great life. They like music, chicks and money and making Nickelback songs is how they live. They like what they do and have no shame. All around they were one of my favorite experiences in the music industry. 10/10 would work with again. "

4996,"Alcohol found in concentrations in normal beer won't kill or even prevent the growth of bacteria - you really need to get up to concentrations that require distillation to get that. Normal brewing with wild yeast won't ever get you above about 10 or 12% alcohol, and that is in a carefully controlled process (like they do for wine).

BUT boiling water in order to prepare it for brewing certainly does kill bacteria, and keeping it in sealed containers (pressurized by the carbonation, so you always know if the container is not sealed) will keep contaminants from getting in.

So - yes! brewing beer makes a safe-to-drink source of H2O. But - no, it's not because of alcohol. The secondary effects of *making* alcohol simply informs you when you need to start over and purify again."

4998,"She's two years older than me. She did stuff like-

- when I was three she convinced me to pile as many blankets as we could on our sleeping little brother until our mom got back. I'll never forget my moms reaction when I excitedly told her about our hilarious prank. Luckily he was ok.

- when I was about 7 daring little bro climbed high up a tall evergreen tree on our property and was hanging on a branch. He wasn't sure how to get down and I tried convincing him to hang on while i got our parents. My sister starting shaking the tree and yelling, ""fall! Fall! Fall!"" He fell, yelling out on his way down and landed flat on his back. My sister ran away and my brother was unconscious for several of the most terrifying seconds of my life. Luckily he looked around and was fine. I got back and was bewildered to find out my sister hadn't told anyone, since I thought she must have ran to ask for help.

There were a ton of things, she was horrible to us (most often to me because im also female) our whole childhoods and enjoyed causing me as much suffering, helplessness and anger as she could to vent her own frustrations, but those are the only two times I look back and go, ""wow, she actually wanted to kill us.""

There were a ton of signs, no big realization until I became haunted by random anger attacks over childhood injustices, like her forcing me to destroy my art as a kid and my parents denying any wrongdoing on her end (but never allowing me any outlet for revenge because my mom was scared of her and made me be submissive to her every demand) all the time. Had to walk out of a Zootopia showing today because I couldn't get it out of my head and I was breathing heavily.

The reason I would categorize her as a grade A psycho is because she would actually pretend to be nice and use lies and manipulation and had no guilt about any of this. I was about sixteen when I finally refused to take the fall for something she did (even though I thought about it-- it took me a long time to see how evil she was). She was great at painting herself as a victim who just had to have me say I did it because I supposedly wouldn't get in as much trouble."

You can cut a sphere up into pieces, and then reassemble those pieces to get two spheres which are exactly the same as the first sphere.

It sounds impossible, but the following analogy might help:

Imagine you have a dictionary where every string of letters is a word, so the dictionary lists all strings of letters. So AAAA is a word, WXYZ is a word, even ZZZZZZZZ.........Z is a word. Now because the dictionary list all possible words, it also lists BAAAA, BWXYZ, BZZZZZZZZ.........Z, CAAAA, CWXYZ, and so on. 

So, if we take all the words that begin with the letter B, we can remove the first B from all of those words then we will have a list of all the words in the original dictionary.

If we do this 26 times, we'll get 26 copies of our original dictionary, plus A,B,...,Z left over.

Infinity is weird.

5353,"I think this is historically true in the US as well, but only within a given region. So for example if you listen to clips of [FDR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhtuMrMVJDk) (high class) and [Fiorello La Guardia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1CkiooYgkg) (low class), both were born in 1882 and grew up in New York City, but they sound quite different at least to me. Similarly, a Virginia or Boston accent will betray a lot of class information to people from that area, but I wouldn't trust myself to reliably tell the difference.

And today, with American accents getting more neutral in general, and regional accents in particular becoming much less pronounced, (EDIT 2: [Turns out](https://www.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics/comments/4kw29m/american_english_accents_are_getting_more_neutral/d3i8aau) this isn't true. Hat tip to the folks at /r/badlinguistics for both catching this and being surprisingly polite about it.) the most obvious think still marked by accent is race. I think most Americans could accurately guess the race of an anonymous voice on the radio, but quite possibly not what class or part of the country they come from.

EDIT: Many commenters have pointed out (and I hadn't thought of it this way but I tend to agree) that in today's US the very *presence* of a strong regional accent tends to indicate lower class."

5375,"Had one kid in a university final exam, come to the exam, take an exam booklet, but then put a fake name and student number on the front. He wrote nothing in the book, but handed it in, so that when we counted the booklets at the end, it corresponded to the number of students who had written. (This is Canada, where we keep track of exam booklets carefully.) Of course he got a grade of zero, because we had no exam for him -- but he then grieved the grade, claiming that we had lost his exam booklet, and he had proof from the sign-in sheet that he had written the exam. Since it was all our fault, he wanted us to average his term work for his final grade.

Didn't work though. He must have been hoping that the TA would throw away the booklet (lots of students fill in their names on multiple booklets, but then don't get around to writing anything in them all, so we throw out the empty ones), but in fact TA had saved it and filed it with all the rest. When we pulled it out of storage and examined it, the fake student number turned out to be the student's real number, with each number shifted by one digit. So student got busted, zero in the exam plus disciplined. Gotta admit though, it was creative. Plus the student had paid really careful attention to how the system worked.

While I believe his actions in CW are pretty justified, the road he's going down in the MCU is sort of painting him as an accidental villain. He used to be this huge weapons dealer, and then after he gave that up, he created a mega death bot that nearly destroyed the world. In the comics he's usually the one painted in a bad light, but in the movies he's come across as more sympathetic. However, looking at his track record, he has potential to be the MCU's best villain yet. Completely by accident.

5449,"To expand slightly further: the campaign fought by the Western Allies to liberate Western Europe is one of the great historic examples on how to successfully organize an armed force with a clear chain of command and objective, while the Nazi campaign to defend their conquests in Western Europe is an indictment on the ultimate inefficiency of personal autocratic control of an armed force during war.

One would assume that the obvious top-down structure of the Nazi Party and German society during WWII would lend itself to a clear and efficient chain of command starting with Hitler at the top and working down to the Armed Services High Command (Oberkommando des Heeres or OKH) to the theater commander (Rundstedt) on to the field commanders etc. In reality, Hitler was always too paranoid (like most dictators) to allow too much power to be concentrated in the hands of any subordinate so, rather, the Nazi command was totally convoluted and cumbersome, unable to function in any event notwithstanding the differing opinions of his theater commander and field commander (Rommel) on how best to combat the coming Allied invasion. For starters, above OKH Hitler had created the Oberkommando Des Wehrmacht (Supreme Command or OKW) in 1938 as a personal command staff superior to OKH, but in reality it functioned as an unnecessary layer of command, which over the course of the war took personal command of formations piecemeal while leaving others under the traditional OKH structure despite the fact that these formations may have had the same field or theater commander and fought side by side with other formations under OKH command. 

The result in the West was this [monstrosity](http://media-2.web.britannica.com/eb-media/89/47989-004-98153B82.jpg) of a chain of command in which Hitler controlled the Army, Navy and Air Force commands while also personally controlling the Panzer Forces and having to be consulted in the orders of Army Group B in France despite the fact that both were nominally under Rundstedt's command. Hitler being indisposed on the morning of the invasion was therefore the worst possible scenario to occur since it paralyzed the German command from the top (strategic) levels all the way to the field (operational) level. To be fair to both Rommel and Rundstedt, regardless of how their forces were organized and deployed they were likely to lose the coming campaign because the Allies had total control of the air, the sea, and possessed the initiative when it came to the time and place of the invasion, being constrained only by the tides and geography of France. However, the German command structure was the worst possible design that could realistically have been fielded by a professional armed force.

The Allies, on the other hand, had a clear, professional and corporate-like command structure despite the fact that they were a coalition force facing the (on the surface) homogenous German Armed Forces. The Western Democracies (those same excoriated by Hitler and the Nazis as being incapable of organization and decision making due to the fractious nature of their politics and societies) managed to field probably the best example of an organized [force structure](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Supreme/charts/USA-E-Supreme-p54.jpg) capable of taking a multinational armed expedition into the greatest and most complex single military operation in history and succeeding beyond even their most optimistic projections. No one realized it on June 5th (Eisenhower thought the chances were a little better than 50/50), but there was no way that the invasion was going to fail, despite the real obstacles that did in fact appear in the real event (unexpected opposition on Omaha beach, the airborne misdrops, etc.). The Allies had done their homework and organized victory, while the amateur in Berlin had organized nothing but failure."

The problem was that this hotel had had a fire, and then sat open to the elements for 5 years before the refurbishment work began. Obviously the entire interior basically had to be stripped. 

My firm was hired to do design and specification work, but no on site inspection or design for the demolition and slapping works. If we had been hired we most certainly would have been able to stop the accident;  the workmen on site decided to speed up the demolition work they would bring a small digger up the old hotel lift, to the 4th floor, and begin the demolition work there.

It was a really honest show in terms of its themes and how it presented them and the first one that comes to mind when I saw the topic title."

And all that's bad enough, but then on one of the last days she gets her swimsuit on and joins us down at the beach... to make my friend pose for some cute Facebook pics with her that she smiled wide for and made look like they were having fun, after which she returned to her former state.

5489,"I feel like people are super concerned with African Americans' problems (which they should be as they are real and valid) but practically ignore the issues facing other minorities. 

For example, I see a ton of blatant racism towards Native Americans in the media/society that a lot of people either don't notice or think is fine. Things that, if done to any other race, would be seen as barbaric (e.g. the Redskins). I only use that as an example because I'm Native and it affects me and it's a pretty clear example. It seems like so much focus is put solely on one group's problems while the others' are widely ignored.

edit: Like I said, I brought up the Redskins issue only because it's a clear example of the mistreatment of a minority being perceived as normal. The people in this thread whose first instinct is to defend the name kind of prove my point. Obviously there are many other issues Natives (and other minorities) face that go ignored as well."

We had a young Chinese couple come in with their friends and get married, the minister did his normal speech but when it came down to the vows I could tell something was wrong. The groom kept putting the ring on the brides finger and taking it off hesitantly. This went in for a few uncomfortable minutes. At one point the groom asked the bride if there was someone else and she nodded her head. After a couple more awkward moments the minister explained that if he did not pronounce them man and wife it wouldn't be legal. They decided not to get married.

* Don't like your friends
* Your friends don't like them (Not just one friend, all of them)
*  Your parents don't like them (they know more than you do)
*   They give you ultimatums. 
*    They use sex as a power play (""*No sex for you for that!*"")
*   They talk down about / to you in front of others. (*""Oh you're so stupid sometimes""*)
*    They talk down about your hobbies, and belittle you. (""I can't believe you play video games, you're so childish"").
*    You either end up doing what they want to do - or fighting. (""Cold shoulder"")
*    They hold a grudge for ages.
*   They are overly negative about anything. ""This place sucks."" ""You aren't funny"" ""This isn't fun"" (not just a few times... all the time.)
*    Anything they do wrong is okay because you did something 'bad' X time ago.
*    They don't trust you. They check your messages, and your phone calls, and your emails, and your facebook. etc etc.
*    They expect you to please them, and yourself. ""You are lucky to be with them.""
*    They say how they could do so much better than you.
*    They don't like their parents (Unless you've met their parents and you can see why, for yourself)
*    They act like you're their savior at the beginning of a relationship (they need saving from an abusive parent/boyfriend/stalker) Then they guilt you when things start to go bad that you're going to push them back there.
*    They get way more drunk / fucked up than a situation calls for. Quiet one at the pub? Fucking smashed. BBQ at yours? Fucking plastered.
*    You end up apologizing for them to your friends, and they don't think they did anything wrong, so they wont. So you do it behind their back. Then give you shit if they find out.
*    You end up apologizing for them to your parents. As above. 
*    You get sympathetic looks from members of the same sex / members of the same sex avoid meeting your gaze, while you're in public interacting with your SO, at a bar / restaurant etc.
*    They want to know what you're spending your money on, when they keep what they spend theirs on private. 
*    You live two lives: One where you ignore the fuck out of your SO, and another where you do everything and anything they want. 
*    They 'let you' have a night for yourself, then guilt you about it for the next god-knows how long.
*    They make fun of your sexual desires, sexual drive, or sexual organs. They don't care about making you feel good, sexually.
*    They don't respond to you. They expect a response from you immediately (and you get punished for this).
*    They won't go out of their way to help you. They expect you to go out of your way to help them.

5540,"It was a quiet night at The Burrow. Pots and pans lay unwashed in the sink. Two bowls of cold vegetable soup sat on the table, accompanied by stale bread. On the windowsill was a candle, melted all the way down to the end of its wick. It finally flickered. The kitchen faded into darkness.

A brilliant green light flashed through the kitchen. The fireplace burst into flame, and the shadow of a man appeared from within. He stepped forward slowly, bowing his head to clear the mantle. Taking a step to the side, he turned back toward the fireplace. Frowning, his eyes squinted as another bright green fire erupted.

A plump woman stepped out. The man held out his hand to assist her. She ignored him, and walked slowly to the table.

“Such a mess,” Molly said, as she began clearing the table. She took the dishes to the sink, grabbed a rag, and began to wash. 

“Get the light, will you dear?” she asked. Arthur was taken aback.

“Molly, sweetheart, surely dishes can wait. We’ve had such a long-”

“Lights please, Arthur,” she interrupted. Arthur pulled his wand from his coat and waved. The lantern on the table ignited, casting a golden light on the cramped kitchen. He opened a drawer and procured a fresh candle. He placed it in the windowsill and lit it with his wand.

They were both so dirty. Dust and grime had invaded every fiber of their tattered clothing. Arthur had a cut on his left cheek, crusted with dried blood. 

Molly wasn’t without her own injuries. Her body was beaten and sore, but she did not care for the moment. It felt good to do the dishes. It felt good to not think, even for a moment.

Arthur was unsure how to respond. He raised his hand to scratch the back of his head. As he did so, bits of dust wafted into the air. He finally decided to sit. He pulled out a chair and clumsily fell into place. He sat there with his head down, vacantly staring at the table in front of him.

Molly was busily taking care of the dishes. Arthur would raise his head briefly every so often to watch her. He wanted to intervene, but he knew her too well. He knew that this was her way of handling her grief. Even still, he finally decided to speak.

“Honey, this is madness.” She began to scrub her pan more ferociously. Arthur stood up and extended a hand to her shoulder.
She jumped, dropping her pan in the sink. Arthur embraced her. She was shaking. Her hands lay limp at her side. 

“You must get some rest,” he said, rubbing her back as he spoke.

“Yes, yes. I think I might.” Arthur slowly helped her out of the kitchen. They made their way through the living room. Molly suddenly stopped, mouth agape. 

She was looking at the clock.

Her face turned at first to horror, and then crumpled into agony. Every feeling she had suppressed burst forth in a torrent of chaos. Her knees gave way, and Arthur grabbed her and gently guided her as she fell to the floor. Her panicked sobs echoed through The Burrow, casting a dark emotional shadow on her once cheery home.

“My baby boy!” she sobbed. She buried her face in her husband’s chest. Arthur was silently weeping at her side, but he knew he had to be strong. For her. He petted her head as she cried.

After a while, he looked up at the old clock that did not tell time. Arthur saw that Molly’s hand was with his, pointing at ‘home.’ Most of the others were pointing at ‘school.’ They had stayed at Hogwarts. 

But there was one hand that stood on its own. It was separate from all the others, pointing to one word.

Lost.

So my mother (who is an abusive bitch) was making me change into anything childlike that wouldn't show off my breasts while talking to my aunt. She was complaining that she couldn't find anything in my cupboard that would fit me modestly. My aunt said ""maybe it's a sign that she's supposed to be a loose slut"". My mum had been calling me a slut since my boobs started growing at 10, and so I turned around and said to her ""at least I don't have a baby who's father is a mystery"".

The next morning as I'm leaving to get her items I asked her exactly what she needed and I was told **almond milk**. . .so I go to the store and purchase almond milk and I get home and throw it in the fridge because she's in the shower. When she gets out of the shower and goes to make cereal she grabs the almond milk and is very upset that it isn't coconut-almond milk. . .irrationally upset. . .Like I just killed a puppy kind of upset. . . I told her it was easily replaced and we can just go back to the store and return it - Apparently that's too embarrassing. . .So I told her to give it to me and I'd do it. . .Nope still an issue.

Long story short she started raising her voice and cutting me off from speaking - I started raising my voice to try to get a few words in. . . .She yelled at me to stop yelling (I wasn't. . .I was talking far softer than she was) . . We kept arguing which was stupid, this was an issue that was easily solved by me just driving 1mi away to get new milk. . . 

Now usually in an argument when things get heated she runs to the bedroom and slams the door while I wait patiently outside and than a new arguments ensues over why I didn't follow to comfort her. . .This time however I was feeling claustrophobic and told her I needed to go for a walk outside, which was a strategy we had agreed on in an earlier fight a few months back. . .communicating when either of us needed to walk away from a little bit and clam down. . . .As I was leaving the house she threw an apple at my head, almost shattering the glass display stand by our front entrance stairs (2nd floor private entrance apartment). I turned around to confront her, I barely got the words ""did you really just throw a fucking apple at my head"" out and was pushed backwards, everything in my hands fell down the stairs, I managed to catch my balance. . . .She tells me she was afraid I was going to hit her, but in 4 years of relationship **that had never ever ever happened not even close**. . .

I left after than to go to a friends and spend the day, I was sickened. . .When I got home that night we continued to argue, or at least she argued in my general direction. . .She was upset that I would not apologize for being mean to her.

So my mother instituted the Underwear at the Table-rule, stating that during dinner everyone needs to be wearing underwear at the very least, otherwise no dinner.

- Read a beginner tutorial for your language of choice
- Watch a video tutorial, they also exist
- Read a book aimed towards beginners
- Pick a project and learn things as you go

Searching for '&lt;language name&gt; tutorial' should give you some results.

The easiest  to get started with is probably JavaScript, which is primarily used in websites ([here's a tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics)).

5651,"I had a moment of clarity the other day, where I realized that I'm the first person in my family line for probably many generations to have that kind of luxury. My grandfather left his childhood home with a donkey and whatever they could carry. He worked most of his adult life in a factory under dangerous conditions, and couldn't afford proper medical care when he became disabled. My parents mostly spent what they earned month to month and whenever they built up any savings at all, it was gone within a year or two. I grew up without even the remotest idea that my life would be any different, always assuming that my success or failure would be dictated by how much money I could earn in a month and being lucky enough to remain healthy so I could keep working.


But now I'm in a different world. Stable income, very few expenses, higher education is paid for. I'm in a situation where I'm able to save the majority of what I earn. Realizing that I'm soon going to have more money lying around in savings than I actually know what to do with. Nobody in my family has ever been in this situation before.


So I started to learn. It's a very bizarre feeling. Even just hearing the idea of somebody owning stocks sounds or putting money into CDs sounds like another person's life, somebody who isn't me. I grew up in a neighborhood where teens were shooting each other over what color they were wearing, not one where they applied for internationally acclaimed universities. Now I'm at a point in my life where I'm young, healthy, have a whole career ahead of me, and I have to actually learn how to invest my money soon, or it's gonna go to waste."

One day the teacher was in a grouchy mood, and couldn't get the control of his class room (people talking, laughing, generally not paying attention).

Mind you all of this is in french. He then goes to say that they should be polite because he is being polite. 

Now Polite in french is ""Polie"" (pronounced Po-lee). So the teacher in his raging rant says: ""MOI, JE SUIS POLIE"", translating to ""ME, I AM POLITE"".

5688,"Thank you for saying this. I'm a prosthetist (someone who makes and fits artificial limbs) and the number of my patients who are diabetic and who had to have amputations because they just haven't taken care of themselves is staggering. 

If you or your parents or grandparents have diabetes, for the love of all that is holy please take care of yourselves. Try to keep your blood sugar under control and CHECK YOUR FEET FREQUENTLY. An ulcer takes a lot longer to heal in patients with diabetes, and what starts as a simple infection can take off and end with you losing your foot in a shockingly short period of time. 

No seriously. Talk to your parents and grandparents. As we often say, ""If you've got diabetes, check your feeties!""


Edit: Several people have asked what it means to check your feet. Paraphrasing from eosino: 

""Diabetics often have reduced sensation in their feet, meaning they can injure their feet without realizing it because they don't feel the pain. If you're diabetic it's important to visually inspect your feet every day so that you can see all the skin [top, bottom, sides, and in between the toes] and make sure you didn't get any unnoticed cuts or scrapes or burns and get them treated."" It takes a lot longer to heal when you have diabetes and if you've lost any sensation in your feet you might not know you have a problem until it's a big deal. So it's important to note anything unusual going on with your feet and especially to notify your doctor if there's an infection or something that isn't healing.

A deep, infected ulcer on the bottom of a foot that goes unnoticed for weeks until it has eaten through to your bone can cause major problems, so good habits and early prevention are the name of the game. If you have any questions, encourage your loved ones to go to their primary doctor, endocrinologist, podiatrist, etc. and show them what they should be looking for.

*  First, everybody was in school and broke as shit - so food was minimal. 
*  Second, it was an extremely long ceremony September in south Georgia, *outside*. 
*  Third, it was a very uppity Young Life crowd so the reception had no alcohol &amp; was also outdoors. Way to worship a God whose first miracle was to provide alcohol at a wedding, yet consider it sinful to have alcohol at a wedding. Y'all really thought that shit through.
*  Fourth, they clearly had not planned the reception because random people kept standing up to talk about random God stuff in their life totally unrelated to the bride &amp; Groom &amp; nobody bothered to shut that shit down. 
*  Fifth, **and worst of all** FOUR people proposed during the reception. One person fucking did it as the DJ was trying to get the Bride/groom out for their first dance. Bride/Groom didn't seem to mind though, but all of that stuff would have pissed me off. 

This was about 7 years ago. Pretty sure none of those people are still married and I know at least one engagement was called off.

I could only reply with ""Really? Really?"". Bush had absolutely NOTHING to do with the bin Laden raid, but because conservatives didn't want to admit Obama had just gained a huge foreign policy victory, they deflected all of the praise onto the last Republican President, saying that his administration's actions made the raid possible. Never mind the fact that Bush gave up looking for bin Laden after 2004. It was an amazing act of mass delusion."

I've reported her to social services several times when she's done something especially bad (not feeding sister for a week, leaving both my sisters alone at a very young age with a man she knew was a convicted child abuser and other horrible things)but she's so charming and sister is so scared of her that nothing ever happens, especially since she loves to use the 'she's crazy and trying to cause trouble' argument (I have bipolar II, social anxiety disorder, agoraphobia and PTSD, so she's not wrong there. Doesn't mean I'm lying though). So yeah. Sorry about this massive vent.

Before I moved to England, a kid in my class (8th grade) told me that it was technically illegal to do so because I didn't speak English (we are both American). Maybe he gets a pass for his stupidity because he was young at the time, but damn was that dumb. He also thought that Japan dropped an atomic bomb on Pearl Harbor because he saw the preview for the movie 'Pearl Harbor' which featured a behind-the-bomb shot of the crippling blow dealt to the USS Arizona. His justification was that he thought that only atomic bombs ""dropped like that""... I guess conventional bombs just float about until they make contact with something. I also told him that the civil war was fought between the American south and Canada (I told him that the American north was neutral) which resulted in him arguing with our history teacher about it. I guess I'm grasping at low-hanging fruit here.

While teaching tank/infantry integration, I gave a lecture on the strengths and limitations that tanks have and how cooperation between infantry and tanks could better ensure mission accomplishment and then had my guys familiarize an infantry company with the tanks (letting them crawl all over a tank). This SAW gunner approached me and, without any self-awareness, explained to me that he has more tactical utility than a tank because he is mobile. I guess a tank's array of specialized optics, enhanced communication abilities, amazing armor, over-ground mobility, machine-guns (that coaxial M240 will shred you at great distances and my .50 would do even better), and big-ass 120mm main gun (which could fire an array of specialized rounds, some of them accurate over several kilometers) isn't as deadly as that one baby-faced Lance Corporal with his SAW. 

If only that was the only time... we even ran into Staff NCOs who were so in love with their weapons systems that they'd make claims such as ""they could take out an M1A1 with a Mk.19 40mm automatic grenade launcher"". My gunner almost got into a fist-fight with a Sergeant who thought his HMMWV/""Humvee"" with a Mk.19 could kill our tank. We'd see them from miles away and be able to engage a target like that far before we would be within their weapons systems' range; even then, 40mm grenades wouldn't really do shit to a tank. I pacified the situation, but I kind of wanted to see my hulk of a gunner beat that annoying snot of a Sergeant into the side of his stupid HMMWV.

5904,"Lmao, this reminded me of my honeymoon

We were in the Dominican Republic, in a rural hotel kind of setting. Well I must have eaten something bad. My wife and people we were with decided it was a good idea to go parachuting off a mountain (the activity name escapes me)

Well after a 2 hour hike, cold chills, and way too far to turn back I realize the moment of truth was upon me. I was going to shit my pants. And as much as my wife said she loved me, a overweight guy with shitty pants wasnt going to be dream honeymoon material. 

So I see a few guys jump off the summit of this relatively tall mountain, and I retreat. Like I hear people calling my name. I am deep into the forrest/jungle. I drop trout, let loose the fiery sauce of hell. And then realize...... its a war zone down there. 

Socks were the first to go ........ They dont absorb as much as you would think. Then it was my underwear........ which mind you apperantly were damp with sweat and just smeered it all over. 

So I took off my tshirt, I guess I am rambo-ing it. That did the trick. But man alive I stunk. 

The look of my wifes face when I emerged sockless, shirtless, and sweaty as fuck from the bushes. SHE KNEW, she knew so much. but we kept it quite. Funny story thats one of the first times I realized this woman would never judge me.

Third bar, we got in, got a seat, but then the bouncer came over to say that he instructed no one to serve us. I said that he shouldn't hate us because his dad never loved him. Got asked to leaved after that, and when I wasn't moving out of the booth fast enough, he started yelling... so I pushed the table into him so I could get out faster. Funny part about that is then he said ""Now you're totally kicked out!"", as if he could kick me out AGAIN.

So there's still a 2/3 chance that the prize is one of the two doors you didn't pick, since there's still three doors. The 1/3 probability of the door that opened goes to the third door that neither of you picked, because the host knows where the prize is and would never pick it. Since the door he picked is now worth 0/3, the door he didn't pick is worth 2/3 to add up to the 2/3 that those doors have, combined.

If the host picked first then you picked, there would be a 1/2 chance for both doors."

5944,"Well as I have looked back on life I was definitely a bully. The thing is I had no idea while I was doing it. 

I grew up really poor. I was picked on all through elementary school. One of the bigger incidents I recall was the guys trying to flush my head in the toilet. 

So 7th grade comes along and I hit a big growth spurt. Someone tried to mess with me one day and I beat him up. I remember from that day on I didn't like to take anything from anyone. 

I would do things preemptively to stop people from picking on me. If someone would try to talk down to me I would immediately make it physical. If I thought someone was going to try something I would go to trying to fight or making someone scared. I never took anyone's lunch money or anything. In my head it was all defense. A vast majority was actually offense. The bullied had become the bully. 

While this was going on I didn't realize that I had become the bully. It was my way of survival. Had I not grown into a pretty large athletic person they wouldn't have stopped.  
I didn't know I had become the bully until after school was over when people told me. I was confronted by a guy who told me what I had done. I felt like shit. 

I was kicked out of high school in the 11th grade. It took about a year for me to realize how bad I had fucked up. I got my GED, joined the Navy, went to college and now I work in a factory and have a good life I guess. To this day the things that people did/said to me for many years still hurt. It hurt more realizing that I had done the same thing to others. 

I really had no idea that I was being a bully. "

They put him away in an institution for a few years, then let him go free. When I found out in around 1985 (murder happened in 1977) that he was free, he'd already been out for about four years, was married, and had two kids IIRC. There's a lot more to this story. For instance, my girlfriend then (now my wife), well her mother was this girls boss back then. My mother-in-law sent her on an errand that night, and the guy was hiding in the back of her car when she came out do to this errand, and murdered her (after riding around in the back of her car, hidden, for something like two hours.) I didn't know this and was reading about him being free and ranting about it when my girlfriend told me to shut the hell up. We were at their house. Her mom was in the kitchen crying her eyes out.

Meanwhile, I take up running and lose 50 pounds, she says nothing besides commenting on every thing I eat and that I have had enough. Not wanting butter on my kids pancakes is seen as ""poor parenting"" even when I explain, why have 100 plus empty calories and not wanting to give my kids the taste preference of it. I don't allow my kids to have anything to do with my sister and her drunk ass new husband. I am a terrible sister/daughter because I don't support her decisions. Don't I understand she is SO happy. 


My husband and I are team. He changes the kids diapers and gets them food. I get dirty looks from her, and some times even comments that I am a lazy Mom for not doing it.

Edit: This blew up. Some notes; I use ""small talking"" semi-regularly so if you need to cite me feel free. Second yeah she was obviously having a bit of a hard time with the kid and my objective wasn't to be a cunt but, she was literally leaving the candy on the floor. She had no intention of picking it up or making the child do it, that bothered me because the problem was no longer just teaching the kid a lesson she was making some one else's life harder.

6066,"Many people are taught that the Roman Empire collapsed in AD 476 when the last emperor abdicated. Really, that was just the end of the *western* half of the Empire, and even that's debatable.

The eastern half of the Empire morphed into the Byzantine Empire and survived until 1453. Despite gradually discarding Latin in favor of Greek and creating an Orthodox Christian theocratic monarchy, they continued to call themselves Romans until the very end. Their viceroys used a family name that became a title in the first centuries AD: Caesar. This title was occasionally conferred on foreign leaders (usually grudgingly) such as the leaders of the Bulgarians. The word was translated from Latin through Greek to the Slavic languages and became ""tsar"". The last tsar was the king of Bulgaria, who was forced to abdicate in 1946. Arguably, he was the last person to formally use an ancient Roman title.

The Byzantine/eastern Roman empire formally was abolished when the Turks took Constantinope in 1453. It's very likely, therefore, that some people born citizens of the Roman Empire lived to hear of Columbus's landings in the New World less than 40 years later."

6076,"When I was a kid, maybe 10 or so, my friend and I were playing football in his front yard. Meanwhile, the nanny of a neighbor of ours was taking a walk with my neighbor's baby in a carriage and their very large Great Dane. She thought, for some erroneous reason, that it would be a smart idea to *tie the leash of the Great Dane to the baby carriage while she was strolling through the neighborhood.* I saw her walking down the street and immediately thought about the consequences of this. So, she continues to walk by us, down the street and out of sight towards the cul-de-sac. We keep playing football and she comes back from the other direction, listening to her music, completely unaware of what was about to happen. Suddenly, the Great Dane stops and just stares down the street. There was a squirrel in the road. Next thing I know, this *massive* dog is flying down the street, dragging the baby carriage, which is now on its side with the baby in it. The nanny begins to freak out and she begins to chase the dog down the street. As she chases the dog, I see the baby fly out of the carriage and onto the road. My friend, Matt, and I stood there in complete shock, speechless. Then I say ""Matt, call 911."" (We were at his house and this was during a simpler time when 10 year olds didn't need a cellphone.) He doesn't move. ""MATT CALL 911."" He runs inside and calls 911, then gets his mom who thankfully was a nurse at the time. The ambulance, fire truck and police showed up to handle the situation. Thankfully, the baby was fine, only a few scratches and bruises. The nanny was fired.


**TL;DR** When I was little I witnessed a Great Dane drag a baby carriage with a baby in it down my street."

6102," “The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.

Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.

But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.”

I was the only person who did it, one day a tech in the OR threw a gallbladder in the trash that was supposed to be tested for cancer. They came to me to go through the dumpster to find it. The trash from the OR was transported to the safe compactor as the cafeteria. It was January, roughly 10 degrees or so out, and I spent 3 hours going through the trash trying to find that fucking gallbladder. No luck. I went back to the head of the OR and told him this was just too damn difficult to do, and he said and I quote..""Well, we'll just tell him it was all clear and schedule him a checkup a little sooner than usual"". WHAT THE FUCK BRO.

Edit: I'm also slightly positive he was joking and surely they could have found another way to test the guy, it just baffles me that someone threw a gallbladder in the trash and they were just gonna ""wing it"" from there."

That, made me feel a little weird, looking down at a girl in a chair, legs all twisted, but she was really enthusiastic, and i stopped feeling bad. She also insisted on anal only (fine by me), so when the time came I picked her up out of the chair and put her on her back on the bed. Lifting her legs up above her heard was the weirdest part, cause they were very small, slightly twisted, and lacked almost all muscle. They were soft and squishy, and I felt like they would break in my hands. But she was horny as hell, and had lube ready. Clearly she had put something up her butt before, because i slide in rather easily. She was wild, made lots of sounds, had an assgasm, and let me cum inside her ass. Again though, her legs, just kept flapping around if i didn't have a good hold on them, and when she came, they twitched like crazy. After we were done, we hung out and smoked some of her medical pot, and I left. A few days later, she messaged me and said she told her parents what happened (why the fuck?) and that we couldn't do it again.

Mom was very bad with it and would cry randomly, and do horrible things.

6183,"Went to a college party with a girl in my dorm.  I knew no one.  I walk in and there was this guy with beautiful flowing blond hair.  He was like a hot Jesus.  Spent all night flirting with him.  He has a friend, cute but not really my type.  Im from the deep south and went to school in Ohio so I say stuff like, ""Sweetie, darling,""  Second guy thinks Im hitting on him.  At the end of the night second guy kisses me.  I was not expecting it but whatever.  Hot Jesus dude was outside smoking.  Fast forward to the end of the party, First guy skates off into the sunset on his skateboard and second guy asks for my number, I give it to him not really thinking about it (3rd week in college, you are suppose to hand your number out, right?).  Second guy says he will call tomorrow, yeah right.  He waited until 2am, called me and said he could smell my perfume on his shirt and did I mind if he came over for a cigarette.  He proceeds to walk across campus (at least 3/4th of a mile) in the middle of the night to sit with me (in pjs) on a bench and we talked for 2 hours.  We have been together for nearly 17 years.  Married 13yrs with 6yr old twins.

One day at a local McDonald's, he has one of these outbursts and this old black dude sitting in the restaurant got upset. He yoked my friend up against the wall and in so many words told him to chill out. Fast forward about a week. My friend and I are in a local park on our bikes. We see the old guy in his gold van and he sees us. He remembers who we are and motions us over. When we approached he demanded my friend shake his hand like a man and he apologizes for what happened at McDonald's days ago. At that point we were both able to see the two girls in the back of the van. Smiling and giggling, one was putting her shirt on. I remember being baffled by her training bra."

6199,"First time I almost came out was rough. There was yelling a screaming, and me getting kicked out of the house by my dad, and then I moved to Texas. My mom was sad, and kept asking when I was coming home,  and I told her I wasn't. 
My mom and I kept touch, and about two years later, I had been complaning about not being able to find my favorite brand of strawberry jam here. A week later, I get a package from my dad. I opened it, and it only had a small container of jam. The shipping was more expensive than the jam costs. I cried, because I knew my dad missed me too, even though he wouldn't say so. 
So I moved back, got an apartment about 35 minutes from their house. 
Six months later,  my dad is in the hospital, he had a heart attack, and a staph infection, and he asks me, point blank. And we don't lie in my family. If they don't want to know,  they don't ask. So I said, yeah, I'm gay.  I explain it to him, he said he always knew, since I only let women hold me as a kid, and I only colored the princesses in the coloring books, since the boys ""weren't pretty"". I let that go. 

But we're good now. I always liked that they didn't ask if they weren't ready to hear the answer.  And don't underestimate what small gestures can do for redemption. I told my dad a few months ago,  why i moved back,  and he cried. I hadn't seen him cry since 9/11. So it was kind of a big deal to him too.   "

2) 
A girl who's ex boyfriend passed away, at the funeral she says nobody seemed sad and didn't even make a big deal over it and she's not sure why. Some replies think he went into witness protection and his fam wasn't sad because it was fake

3)
A redditor was riding his bike in the mid west and someone in a car kept driving near him, whenever he'd try and lose him by making turns (it was an area with farms iirc), the car would eventually end up close to him again, coming from different directions and the driver would ask the same questions (have you seen ____?) as if he didn't remember he had just asked. He googled the person that the driver was asking about and it was some guy who had been released from prison for stabbing someone. The photo of this guy looked just like the driver, so the driver was basically asking if anyone had seen him.

The librarian started letting us stay in the library with her during recess. She said she'd teach us chess, which she did. She taught us the basics, some secret moves, tricks, and related mind games (like drawing a chess board and marking off the places you ""land"" imagining you are a knight. The point being the ""land"" on every space)

We became the ""chess club"" and only 4th and 5th graders were allowed. It wasn't just chess though. She would show us other brain teaser games like rush hour or she would let us put 3D puzzles together. It made the half period after lunch not just bearable, but enjoyable

Got a second one for which I had to sign, took it to my German friend who called the number and they were VERY serious. They told her if I had simply called and told them I wouldn't do it again, they would have dropped it, but because I ignored it, they weren't going to let it go. I ignored it again because who has 400,000 euros to just fork over? Also, I was moving back to the states in a couple months. I just prayed to get out of there without being stopped at customs. I ended up leaving Germany without any problems. I really want to go back and take my dad to Oktoberfest. Part of me is nervous, but the other part of me says, ""it was Sony, not the German government, who was after me; I should be fine.""

This was all over two **songs!** Not albums, but **songs.** I can't imagine being sued over a couple of songs.

Also, they mentioned to my friend that they really don't care that I was downloading, but apparently it's the seeding that they had a huge problem with.

While she is/was my friend, I felt like i should not have to spend $150 on an iPhone just to replace mine because I was doing her a favor, especially because we had an agreement. Not to mention that this iPhone was unlocked, which is very hard to come by on the internet without getting scammed. 

She decided to try and offer me $50 because ""it wasn't her fault"".

6332,"Here is my favorite trick to help people ""wake up early"". ""Early"" is a relative term. It isn't the same specific time for everyone. Therefore, change your ""early"" goal to ""on time"". A simple shift in perspective does wonders. If you feel rushed/stressed every morning, it's not because you are waking up too early because you didn't get enough sleep... you are waking up too late no matter how much sleep you get. Get to sleep earlier.

If you would like to have the time in the morning to stretch, run/workout, make coffee, brush/floss teeth, shit, shave, shower, get dressed, make breakfast, eat, and then have a relaxing drive to work, then figure out how much time that takes and make that your ""on time"" not ""early"". Early to me means that you have extra unplanned time. On time means you know you have the perfect amount of time to start a great day."

6359,"Alright, I'll tell the one that got me suspended as a student:

Mr V was my World History teacher. Mr V was also rather fond of our Gym teacher Ms P(These naming conventions seem backwards). One day during class Ms P drops off papers for Mr V. Seeing Ms P was not a fond sight for me, as she often was yelling at my class and me for running the track with the general PE class(I was Conditioning). 

I'm not sure why I was feeling particularly verbal this day, but Ms P was pregnant at the time and Mr V was always really interested in talking about that fact. He asks when she is due, and damn it to hell if I didn't just get the right quip at the wrong time. 

 ""Yeah and how many are in that litter"" 

**""SEE ME AFTER CLASS _Radiant""** - Mr V. Ms P goes off kinda mad and I don't make it to the end of class. I'm in the Vice Principal's(Mr T cause he's got no time for foo's) office, also a family friend of my dad's. He reads the report, and says in a very serious tone, ""I have to suspend ya for the rest of the day"". I nod in understanding, but without hesitating he just starts laughing. 

I have seen Mr V since graduating a decade ago, and as expected, he's divorced. Dated Ms P for a time from the grapevine but that is what it is.

Bless her precious heart. I love her too much. 

My dad and stepmom reacted a bit weirdly. We were going through a rough time for other reasons when I decided ""Fuck it"" and just changed my relationship status on Facebook to in one with my boyfriend at the time. They got mad at me saying how I don't trust them and how embarrassing it would be for someone to be like ""oh, your son is gay"" without them realising and they were making a big thing of how they would be braver than I was and would have come out to their parents directly instead of like how did. And then they completely flipped it when we started discussing the other problems we had. The exact line was ""You're gay? So what. Big deal"". So that was fun. 

We ended up patching things up and we have an amazing relationship. I'm still the gay son to them but I realise I have it better than a lot of other people.

6470,"Had to learn this one the hard way. It wasn't for me, though. It was for my grandmother. 

She had been in a bit of a funk not long ago. Kind of just sat around the house, drank boxes of chardonnay, and stared at the wall. No vigor whatsoever. When Nana had to make stools, she didn't even push. Just sort of sat there and let them drop at their leisure. Even the racial slurs she shouted at our gardener, Felipe, lacked the psychological impact they usually possessed. 

I came to the decision that gentlemanly companionship would cure her m'laise. After all, she did seem most happy when Dr. Leo was giving her a Pabst smear or prostrate exam. A man attending to her nethers would be just the ticket! 

Tinder seemed like a no-brainer. After explaining to her what tinder was, then explaining to her what a Galaxy S6 was, then explaining to her what a phone was, then explaining to her what electricity was, she finally agreed to give it a shot. Four minutes and six baudy photos leaving nothing to the imagination later, we were in business. 

To say it worked is understatement. I mean, I knew their were thirsty singles in our area, but I had no idea how dry things were out there. Nana received no fewer than a dozen matches in the first hour. I told her she didn't have to entertain all of them, that it was a seller's market, but she came from a more polite era and thus entertained them all. 

It did make her, and me, happy at first. There was a twinkle in her eye, a song in her heart, and a flush in her labia minora (I bathe her, so I notice these things). What were the ""long lasting consequences,"" though? 

First off, she's out for hours at a time. Sometimes, doesn't even get in till the next morning, when I see her doing the Walker of Shame up our driveway in plain view of the neighbors. We already have two strikes from the Homeowners Association. We get a third, the Association might finally have the leverage to compel us to remove the tire-less 1987 Camero IROC from the front lawn (Nana and I maintain it has historical value).

Her groovy lifestyle apparently doesn't allow time for chores, either. Like, she knows it's her job to sweep the pine needles off the roof and clean the gutters. And what about Mister Mistoffoflees? The swollen glands on his butthole aren't going to drain themselves. 

Worst of all, however, is Nana's refusal to use protection. Sure, I get that prophylaxatives are against her religion. Separation of church and state and all. And the dudes believing the whole ""gonorrhea can't live in someone who drinks as much wine as I do"" line probably deserve everything coming their way. The problem is that Nana is reintroducing mostly eradicated STD'S back into the public like an unvaccinated toddler in a ball pit. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if Nana is patient zero for the hoof-in-mouth cluster of outbreaks currently plaguing upstate New York.  

So no more tinder for Nana. The only ""swiping right"" she'll be doing nothing for the foreseeable future will involve a certain feline's anus. If she behaves, though, I might let her try grindr.

6498,"I'll start with a bit of backstory as it goes into how I feel about it now.

I've been bullied through most of my childhood until and including my first year of high school, which I mostly failed because of that. It was about then that I decided to stop being so freaking shy, own up to who I actually was and to hell with what other people thought.

So I was redoing my first year of high school and I was pretty scared that I'd be bullied yet again. Fortunately for me, this time I ended up with a couple of friends, we met new people and we all start to hang out.

Turns out there was a weirdo girl, or well what you would call a weirdo girl. She was seen as weird because she did not have any particular style and she somehow succeeded at being entirely herself all of the time, under any circumstances and was always so cheerful. For instance, during one of our classes we had to re-enact a scene from a play. You can imagine most of us 15 years old just half-assed it, barely playing mostly reading. That girl ? She just fucking lived that scene. Truth is, we probably all were just jealous of her in some way.

Whatever, she was always natural. So my bunch of ""friends' just start being mean-spirited to her, well, actually pretty insulting. Never anything physical but hey, we all know the physical stuff is not the one that hurts us the most. As a shitty teenager afraid of being the next in line to be bullied I just followed suit and it went on for most of the year. At first I did not see how much it hurt her, but throughout the year it became pretty apparent. She started the year as the most cheerful person I had ever seen and ended up almost like an empty shell going through the motions.

At some point I noticed how awful I was and what we had essentially done and I just decided to stop being an ass. My pals gradually stopped until we all moved on to the next year and we were all separated.

So come the following year, She is still in one my class, pretty small group of fifteen-ish students instead of the usual 30/35. This class was essentially two group of six and the two of us all alone, we just start to naturally bond. Amazingly enough, despite all the bullshit that I did the previous year we manage to become very close friends. She was even actually my only friend at the time since I had stopped hanging out with these other guys.

Around a year and a half later we start mentioning for the first time that year when she was bullied. Obviously I apologised, I had been meaning to do so for a while but I never did find the guts to do so. She responds by telling me it was no big deal, I never was the worst of them and always knew when to stop. That's also when she just dropped that she had had a crush on me since then. I did have feelings for her actually too, although it was much more recent and only a few weeks or months old.

We've been dating for seven years now, finally thinking of moving together now that she is about to graduate from university and that I have a steadier job and income.

Honestly, I still feel awful about what I did, especially when I think about how she felt about me and that she thought I never went too far. When I think about that I can't help but feel that I never did try to stop my friends back then either. I never once did anything to help her. I even wonder sometimes if there isn't anything wrong with the fact that we are dating, as if maybe she was still mentally stuck in that first year of high school and I was unaware that I still was a bully.

On the other hand, would we even be together if not for that first year?

**TL;DR** Bullied a girl in high school, ended up dating her a few years later and I'm still with her seven years later."

6511,"Cross stitching is actually pretty fun and you can get into it with a $10-20 investment. With cross stitch, you create pictures by stitching tiny X's onto fabric. To start out, you just need fabric (aida is good for beginners), embroidery thread (DMC is the gold-standard), an embroidery hoop (I don't really like using them but they are cheaper than other frame options), good sharp scissors, and a pattern. Many craft stores have kits that include pre-cut thread, a pattern, and the pre-cut fabric. Small kits can run you about $10 dollars and can take 10-20 hours to stitch, depending on the level of detail in the pattern.

What's great about cross stitching in this day and age is the access to patterns that fit your style and interests. 8-bit video game characters/sprites translate very well to cross stitch. [Sprite Stitch](http://spritestitch.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Pattern) has loads of free patterns for video games sprites and such. Etsy also has a multitude of patterns that you can pay for and download. Pinterest is  also a great place to find free patterns (just don't start a board and add hundreds of patterns that you will never finish). Perler bead patterns also work for cross stitching.

Youtube, as always, has tutorials to help you learn the stitching techniques. I love [this lady](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTXzE8TOiYo). If you buy a kit, the pattern usually has a sheet with text and pictorial explanations of the stitches used in the pattern. [DMC](http://www.dmc-usa.com/Education/Technique-Overviews/Cross-Stitch.aspx) also has a helpful site for beginners, if you learn more by reading. /r/CrossStitch is also a helpful community and resource.

Cross stitch is my favorite hobby. It doesn't require too much initial investment and it provides hours of engagement. I started stitching during undergrad because I needed a study break that didn't involve reading. Cross stitching also helped my nail biting problem, since it gives me something to do with my hands while I watch Netflix. "

So bad, that I didn't eat creamed corn again for *years* after that. Being the great child I was, I choked it all down, because I would have felt like such an asshole if I didn't.

When my parents finally got around to having theirs, they realized the corn was unfit for consumption, looked bashfully at me, and asked how it was. I nodded, and they proceeded to inform me that the corn had gone bad, and I shouldn't have eaten it. Through my embarrassment, I said I didn't want them to be mad at me for going through the trouble of finally making it, and then me not eating it.

My mom was extremely apologetic, and said they wouldn't be mad at me if I didn't eat food that spoiled. I think they both felt super embarrassed for having ignored my request for so long and then presenting me with food poisoning in a bowl."

I was given a pop up book (I remember it was vampires) and the guy fiddled about on his computer, trying to engage me and get me to 'play with him' but I refused and ignored him cause I was really enjoying this book. He went to the bathroom and I managed to climb out of his bedroom window and get back to my flat. I'd missed my lunch curfew and I got grounded and was only allowed 2 Jaffa Cakes when my gran came around later :( We ended up moving from that area not too long after.

Looking back on it as an adult, it really freaks me out what almost happened/did happen and I've just suppressed it very well. How I escaped always struck me as very idealistic, not sure how I would have actually got out through the window at that age.

We liked her, but somehow grew apart from her. Like, we couldn't just text her, hey going to Starbucks wanna come? or group message on facebook that we are all going to lunch. So, whenever I do talk to her she seems lonely and says she didn't make any friends here and just watches TV a lot. I invite her to do something, we have fun, but without fail we lose touch again. 
Its just weird not being able to contact someone through phone or email or internet. I feel like it holds her back at work too because sometimes even our bosses will say, hey, let's go get a beer and then you go socialize, but she never comes because you have to find her physically in person and invite her ahead of time. Or, there will be a google doc of sorts where we are brainstorming ideas and she never participates because she isn't really on the internet.

EDIT: Since so many people are asking if I considered addoption, I am just going to copy paste my reply to one of the comments:

The one rational reason I can think of right now, is that if my children are biologically related to me, I feel like I would be able to understand them better (as in their personalities, and physical development) as opposed to somebody sharing no genes with me. 


I've always wanted to have children, and spread my genes basically, I honestly cannot think of  a good logical reason, but for me, emotionally, I think I would like that better.

I even said if she were incapacitated in some way obviously I'd go to her first, but she didn't want to hear it. We fought out on the street until 3am over this and the cops came. It was really embarrassing.

This was all started because we returned to my apartment that night, that I'd only lived in for about a week, and saw that the building was on fire so I snuck past the police and into the back of the building with my sister and we rescued our cat.

So my new home was on fire, and she decided that it was a good time to fight with me over my cat."

6793,"Yeah, a lot of people don't really know how to shop sales. Don't go shopping without a firm picture of what you *NEED* to buy ahead of time. Such items should be planned expenses, not impulse buys. 

Then, when you have decided what you need, go ahead and look for the best price. Get it on sale, use your coupons. But don't wander through the store aimlessly without a clear picture of what you're going to walk out with. 

If you've been in the market for a new thing that has X, Y, and Z features, and you know that the going price is around 1k, sure, buy it when you see it for $750. 

But if you just happened to be walking through the store and said ""Gee, I guess it would be cool to have this new thing, and look! It's $250 off!"" Then yeah, you probably wasted your money. 


**EDIT for an example:** *I hate shopping for clothes, but I knew that I needed some new sundresses for when it gets humid here. I knew that they go for $80/each full price for the style and quality I want, but I've gotten them for around $20-$30/each (or less) when I shop the sales. So I walked into Macy's, found two dresses I liked, and rung them up. They were full price (total of $160), but I showed the cashier that they were $47/each on the store website.* 

*She price-matched them. I had two coupons for ($20 of of a $50 purchase), so I rang them up separately, adding a $3 chocolate bar to each transaction to bring the price up to $50/each. Then I applied the coupons, and got what was supposed to be a $160 purchase for $60. And these dresses should last me for at least two years of weekly usage for the quality.*

*Not everybody has the time to hunt for sales and coupons. But even having a smartphone on you is a great tool. Most places will price match the items on competitor websites, so if you can find it cheaper and show them, you've already saved a few bucks. Even googling ""coupons for _______"" will turn up something at least half the time when I try it.*"

In fact one article I read for one of my courses even stated that Chinese merchants tried to reach the Roman Empire but were told by the Parthians that they'd have to cross an impassable ocean. They lied so they could keep fabricating myths about Rome to the Chinese and thus profit from them (e.g. they sold silk garments made in Rome to the Chinese, claiming it was ""western silk"", effectively selling the Chinese their own goods back to them. Cheeky bastards)."

Very few regrets. Two major ones:

1) I regret spending so much time and energy wondering what other people thought of me, and trying to make them happy. Other people will be miserable for their own reasons, and it's not a worthwhile endeavour making them happy. Doesn't matter if they're family or ""friends"", make yourself happy first. People who really care will be happy when you're happy.

2) I've chalked up a lifetime of cool experiences, but in hindsight, I'd gladly trade off five cool one-off experiences for expertise in one more skill. Like, if I could really play guitar well, or was 5x better at software development, I'd gladly postpone or give up the strange travel or weird story experiences I have to tell. The stories are cool and amusing, but I wish I had invested more time in developing another talent."

In most cases, it would've been surgically removed but her health was too poor for surgery.  She was on antibiotics constantly to counteract the infections she'd get there.  

Lucky me, it was my job to put it back inside.  I will never forget the first time.  The nurse leaving shift gave me a little report, bed so and so refused his meds again, there was a fight between our Navy guy and Marine guy again.....the usual in other words.  Just as she's walking out the door she says, ""oh yeah, the new patient in three.  If her uterus falls out you have to put it back in.""  She's gone before I can process this statement.  

I am doing rounds before bedtime for the residents.  I was in three when the lady sneezes.  ""Oh, drat.""  She says, ""it fell out again.""

I don't have a weak stomach but what I saw when I unfastened her diaper had my throat twitching with the urge to vomit.

I tried to fold it like a taco but it was slippery, and wouldn't stay and the whole damn time it's pulsing in my hand.  I felt like I could feel her heartbeat.  The smell of this infected organ, the texture, the color...oh gag, words cannot describe it.  Finally I got it folded up and was trying (delicately) to shove it back in but no, that wasn't happening.  I had to wrap it in my whole hand, then shove it deep inside her.  Then, wrist deep, I had wiggle and squirm my hand back out without bringing the uterus back out with it.

As you learn quickly in the medical profession though you can get used to anything.  By the end of the week I could do the whole process in under a minute and then wash up and go to lunch.

6897,"Similar three-person/surprise ending joke:

At the convent, despite their vows, Sister Maria couldn't control her desire to experience some kind of sexual contact, so she gives in to temptation and gives a man a handjob. She confesses to her fellow sisters what she's done, and they advise her to confess her sin to Father Doyle.

After her confession, they ask Sister Maria what Father Doyle said her penance should be. She replied that he told her to say ten ""Hail Marys"" and to wash the offending part of her body, her hands, in the church's font of holy water.

""Well, that's it, then,"" Sister Anna exclaims. ""I'm not going to confess my indiscretion to Father Doyle.""

""Why not?"" Sister Maria asks.

""Because there's no way in hell I'm going to gargle with that holy water after Sister Margaret washes her ass in it.""

6917,"I was a juror on a multiple homicide death penalty case last year.  Most of the killings took place in a small living room, and at one point in the trial they recreated the scene in a spare room in the courthouse.  They had taken hi-res photos of the bloody floor at the original scene, then stitched those together and printed them out on a life-size sheet of canvas.  Then they took the blood stained couches and chairs and the shattered TV and placed them in the original positions.  Then had the jury walk through the scene to get a sense of the space and the shooting angles.  The defendant was shaking and rocking in his seat, seeing that scene recreated.  It was amazingly powerful and deeply disturbing, one of many traumatizing days in that five month trial.  They offered all the jurors (and the court stenographer) counseling when the trial completed, and all of us were pretty seriously affected by the experience.

One day we walk into class and he's at his desk with his head down and we're thinking something is going on so we leave him alone and the bell rings for class to start and he just sits there.

I grew up and went to school in Mississippi. Was pretty cool, not anything like the media or memes portray it. Good childhood experience. Anywho, I ended up moving from MS to Missouri, why MS gets shit and MO gets off scott free I'll never know. This was was ""banjos play as you drive down the abandoned street"" kinda town. 

Anyways, the coincidence was; in MS, I had a friend named Randy whom I knew fairly well. He was an upper classman, but we got along great and was on the football team together. I'd been over to his house multiple times. I knew his family pretty well even. When I started my first day in High School in MO, I met this guy named David. David was a spitting image of Randy and it floored me. 

I thought Randy moved to MO for some reason and of course the second class was over I went to talk to him. He had no clue who I was and this is when I found out his name was David. I told him that he looked JUST like my friend back home and he just kinda laughed it off. 

I ended up calling Randy back home and asking him to email me a picture of him. I told him the story and he laughed it off, just a coincidence and I think both of them thought I was just over exaggerating. 

I got a picture and showed it to David at school the next day. He gets interested and is blown away because they REALLY DO look the same. We joked about them being twins separated at birth. When I got off from school, my mom told me that Randy's mom had called looking for me, so I should call her back. 

I do. She basically told me that Randy was born, and then when he was 3, they had another baby, but they were in a bad spot and felt like they couldn't raise another child. They ended up going for the adoption route. 

I ended up talking to her and David's mom, ended up helping them get in contact and eventually they got together to meet. It was really cool to see my friend from back home get to meet his younger brother who he didn't even know existed. 

The part that gets me is that I was only in Missouri for about 4 months. After I helped get both families together, my dad got real sick and I moved back to MS to help him. I know there are a lot of people who aren't religious and don't believe in fate, destiny, or anything like that, but I seriously doubt they would have gotten together without me moving to MO and I was only in MO for such a short period of time, that sometimes I have to wonder if the only reason I ended up there was to help bring them together.

I am 22 and my half sister is 27. One day she invited me to lunch which was unusual. Because she never really cares about how I'm doing.  I asked her what was wrong and why she wanted to have lunch and she said ""nothing, I just want to have lunch with you."" We arrive and she waits until after the meal to tell me that my dad (not her biological dad) was arrested two days prior because he was addicted to meth. 

I am currently on medication that can give me seizures if I drink alcohol with it and for my 22nd birthday her present to me was a large bottle of wine. When my brother in law saw the embarrassment and sadness in my face he asked me why I had that reaction. I told him about my medication and he was mortified because my sister never told him. From the moment she handed me the bag she was cackling to herself like she made the funniest joke in the world. 

When we were much younger my sister and I shared a room. We had a metal framed bunk bed and she lifted up the mattress of the bottom bunk and told me to look under it. Being the 7 year old I was I obliged and once I stuck my head under she let the mattress go and it hit me with full force in the back of the head and my face hit metal bars. I started gushing blood and after I managed to get myself out I ran to my mom. My sister was pissing herself she was so entertained.  

We also shared a bathroom. She locked me out of the bathroom and wouldn't let me use it to pee and my parent's room and bathroom were off limits. I could hear her laughing as I was begging to use it for two seconds to pee and started laughing harder when I pissed my pants. 

When she was in middle school my parents allowed her to go to the movies with her friends if she brought me along. They bought tickets to Santa Clause 2 (2002) and snuck in a different theater to watch Ghost Ship. I watched until a super gruesome scene and then wanted to leave but she didn't. She had me go into the next theater alone and watch the end of Santa Clause 2. A man came and tried to talk to me and get me to come with him and wouldn't leave me alone until after I refused loudly and ran to a manager. On our way home my sister made me promise not to tell our parents about anything but I was so terrified of that entire day that as soon as we got back to the house and my mom asked ""how was the movie"" I broke down and cried. Mind you I was 8 years old at this time. 


My parents didn't help me pay for college because she dropped out. They didn't help me get a car or teach me how to drive because she was having sex and smoking weed in the car they helped her get. 

And now I don't talk to my family because they treat me like I shat on their favorite piece of cake and my sister is the angel with the husband and the baby and everything is perfect.

Patient went into cardiac arrest on the table after being given the anaesthetic, got wheeled out by paramedics after I called an ambulance. Turns out she shouldn't have been given adrenaline and the dentist just didn't check her medical history properly for whatever reason. That practice got shut down a couple of years later and I still feel guilty every time I think about it for not saying something. She was OK afterwards but it was very scary."

There is no form of public transit, no taxi service, etc. Your options are walk, bike, or vehicle. If you walk, good luck and enjoy waking up in the middle of the night to walk 10+ miles to your job (conservative, for many people who commute into the slightly larger than a village town it's even longer), and then again to go home after working a full shift. Bikes are incredibly dangerous as our roads are not set up to accomodate them at all and living in a praerie area, roads are long straight and flat so people drive faster than a snowball melts in hell.

This entire story goes back almost 5 years ago, so this will be quite long.

I apologize ahead of time for any misunderstandings throughout this explanation. It has been a while since all of these events and I try not to think about what happened. If anything needs clarification let me know.

It all started when my mother lost her job, which led to the splitting up of my parents. I was young then (about 12 years old), and obviously thought going with my mother would be the best choice, as I didn't have much of a relationship with my father. My mother and I lived in and out of family member's houses until she could get back onto her feet. Unfortunately, that never happened, we were kicked out by every family member she had on her side. She was delusional and always spoke about some man named Jamie. Supposedly this Jamie man is my biological father, I still have not seen any form of proof of this claim by my mother. I met him one time when I was about 13 or 14. This is not the only delusional tendencies she has shown. 

Back to me choosing to live with my mother. We ended up living on the streets, basically out of the back of her car. At one point we went to a homeless shelter but my mother didn't want to stay there long because she didn't like the ""rules"" they set in place. We left and went back to living on the streets. At this point in time, we were both living off of about $100 a week. The entire homelessness deal only lasted, *about* 6 months. 

Prior to all of this my mother, more than one time throughout our homelessness time, left me in places on my own because she got upset. For example, one time I spent $1 on a pack of gum so she left me outside of a Wal-Mart and didn't come back for about an hour and a half. As I said this happened multiple times, I'd say it happened at least 4 times. Two out of the times I actually called the police because I was scared shitless, just as any 13-14-year-old would be. I had feared that she was actually going to leave and never come back.

The final time that she left me somewhere she actually didn't come back. At that point I called the police and they came out and picked me up. From there Child Protective Services (CPS) was called and they took me to their office. They got hold of my mother and had her come to the CPS office, where she had to explain what was going on. I was not present in the meeting, but I imagine she told the CPS caseworker some bullshit about how she's been trying to get back on her feet by doing some real estate bullshit. 

Side note: My mother always said that her real estate deal would kick off and that we would have money, but as you guessed, it never happened. It still hasn't happened… almost 5 years later.

The meeting ended, and my caseworker came in to tell me that I was going to basically go into foster care. At this point I flipped shit and tried to get the caseworker to get a hold of my uncle (from my mother’s side, we had stayed with him for about 3 months until my mother decided to assault his wife and daughter). **By the grace of god** they got a hold of my uncle, we'll call him Jerry. Jerry decided he'd do right by his family and take me in until my mother was able to get on her feet. The CPS caseworker waited until the next morning until taking me to my uncle Jerry's. From what I remember the CPS paperwork stated that I was able to go back to living with my mother when she demonstrated she was capable of taking care of herself and I. She never got back on her feet and I lived with my uncle Jerry all the way until I graduated high school, which was just this January.   

Shortly after moving into my uncle Jerry's, sometime around September of 2012, my mother kidnapped her friend’s child. I don't know the specifics of that mess, but I do know that she ended up in county jail for what seemed like ~2 years. During her time in she sent me a plethora of letters, explaining how sorry she was for fucking up and what not. I think I received 40 letters from her, which I kept up until a couple of months ago when I moved to go to college. I only replied to her letters twice. 

Another side note: I remember seeing my mother on the news, my aunt called me to the living room and showed me what was going on. At that point I ran for my phone and called my mother to ask where she was and what the hell she was doing. She gave me her location and I called local police to report everything she told me. They reported back to me saying that they found her thanks to my info.

My mother also tells me that she does not regret kidnapping that child, that she was ""doing it for the good of the child.""

After getting out of county jail she tried to continue our relationship, but I just couldn't do it. I resented her for everything she did. I ignored her phone calls and letters. She had a hard time getting a job after getting out of jail, which I'm sure is to be expected, so there was no way I was going to end up living with her again. 

My mother has constantly, for the past 3 years, told me these crazy things like ""Eyevannn, soon my real estate deal will kick off. I want you to come live with me. I'll buy you anything you want.""  I have not seen a single penny come from this real estate deal she's been talking about for the past 6 years. To me this just scream delusional.

I'm now 18 and I just finished my first semester of college. I have a work-study position at the university I go to and I am paying rent for my own place. It feels amazing to say that. I've wanted to be on my own for so long and now I'm finally doing what I'm dreamed of for years.

I went a little far and beyond the homeless deal, but you asked for my story so you got it lol.  

tl;dr: Parents divorced, mom lost her job, ended up in and out of peoples houses until ending up in a homeless shelter. She decided to be an idiot and kidnap a child, went to jail, I lost all respect for her. I'm now living a great life despite the shit I went through."

"
7134,"Wife's cousin decided to get married at her grandparents ultraconservative church.  She and her husband to be and all the other guests came from other parts of the country and mostly strangers planned the wedding.  It was set on a place that only needs AC for three weeks of the year, and this was in one of those weeks.  

We roll in and the first thing we see is the repeated tagline for the church,""convert the lost, no matter the cost.""  Posters and books inside are clearly marked as Focus on the Family and similar publications.  

The church has no fans, and the windows only open on one side.  It's hot as fuck, but they are also cooking the entire reception meal in the basement.  Instead of pews they have square cushioned chairs that lock together.  These are put together so close it's impossible to move.  We are all dressed respectively and people are sweating through their clothes.  The minister starts into a sermon that is like a veiled threat to those that just go to church and don't take an active part in controlling others thoughts and actions.  Eventually he acknowledges the young couple with a speech about women obeying.  He manages to tell her that she is just a rib to this man (close to the heart and protected under his arm), but that in no way is she the decision maker.  The minister is eluding to the fact that because the groom has some learning disabilities.

We are ushered outside because the bride has made some requests.  We are now in the direct sun and we have tiny vials of bubbles and we are to blow bubbles at the bride.  People try to make a break for the nearby park, but we are herded back in for the reception.  The pew chairs are separated and put around tables.  This is a serious fire hazard at this point, once you are in your seat it is hard to do anything but turn your upper body one way or another.  The center pieces included a plastic boot.  Why?  The bride said she wanted a fairy tale wedding.  The planners half assed that and shopped for glass slippers and bought plastic boots.  I don't think there was much budget, but I think just ignoring the request would have been better.  Here is where it turns really bad.

Father of the bride wants to make a speech.  He is the first person in any group that always speaks up and probably about the last person you would want to.  My wife's uncle is a condescending idiot and oaf who ""tells it like it is"" and nobody has the respect for him to correct him, people just avoid him as much as possible.  The speech is supposed to be about how the bride and groom met.  He tells a story about how a disgruntled ex- employee stalked the hospital where his daughter worked and went room to room shooting people.  He told of body counts, coroner's reports, the doctor that played possum and called the police, and on and on like it was the best thing that ever happened to him.  It was a pretty disturbing story that he wrapped up with ""and the groom was hired as extra security.""

Nobody wanted to follow up that speech.  So it's time for the testimonials.  Anyone can speak from their chair and say what they wanted.  It broke down into three different sets of advice/observations/memories:  The bride is fat, lets all remember the time she ate an entire pie or couldn't fit into an item of clothing.  The groom is sweet for a boy who has had it so tough with mental disabilities.  And it will get rough, get closer through Jesus.  Many speeches about how the woman must submit and obey and have no identity of her own.

We eat and it's time to go to an old bomb shelter for dancing.  On the way most people take a 3 mile detour and stock up on Gatorade.  I almost bought a handle of something to be the hero, decide to just endure because the worst is probably over.  Dancing and games is the post wedding entertainment.  It consists of the brides family singing religious and country songs over a PA system.  Between the songs the games include writing your favorite bible verse on a card and grandma will read it so others can guess who wrote it.

This was after repeated honks and shouting from several people. Anyways after the wash I park my car and I waited for this old hag to leave the car wash at which point I stopped her. When I asked what she thought she was doing she quickly rolled up the window shouting it was her right because she was old. And I yelled that she should have her license taken away, and I'm pretty sure wrinkly bitch was included in that....anyways about two weeks later I run into her again, or rather she tried to run into me as I was crossing the street with my dog........fuck that lady.......

7172,"**Rabbit is OCPD, not OCD.**  OCPD is a persistent personality style corresponding to a kind of rigid, rule-governed perfectionism that can often result in a really bizarre level of neat-freakery.  Honestly, probably a level of all-domains personal rigidity far beyond what you're imagining with respect to your-college-roommate-who-was-totally-like-this.  OCD is, fundamentally, an anxiety disorder in which distressing intrusive thoughts (obsessions) are coped with by means of often elaborately-ritualized behaviors (compulsions).  As often than not, they're kind of slobs.  It's tough to keep your life together when you have to keep twirling your toothbrush just right in groups of 32 alternating clockwise and counterclockwise rotations to prevent your house from catching fire.

Also, unrelatedly, when I was a kid, my schema of who would engage in gardening was limited and gender-typed enough that I simply assumed Rabbit to be a woman.

7173,"I didn't tell my parents; they approached me about it after my mom found the key to my locked desk drawer, opened the drawer, found my journal that I'd been writing in for years, + proceeded to read the entire thing. I was at my boyfriend's place at the time, under the pretext that he was just a friend. 

My mom, not knowing how to react, had my dad read the journal, as well. She then called my sister. So, in the course of a day, I went from being safely closeted to having my entire family knowing intimate secrets I'd be hesitant to share with even my closest friends. 

I come from the stereotypical conservative Christian household, so you can imagine how well this all went over. After returning home from my boyfriend's house, my mom asked me to come into the living room to talk. I somehow immediately knew what was about to happen, so I tried to prepare myself.

""I want you to tell me what makes you think you're a homosexual."" These were the exact words my mom spoke twelve years ago, + I'll never forget them. Suddenly, the ladybug crawling along our coffee table became the most fascinating thing I'd ever witnessed while my brain tried to elicit a response that didn't say something to the effect of 'I like sucking cock.'

My mom cried, my dad yelled, the trust in the family was betrayed. I had a rocky relationship with them while I lived there, so I moved out at my first opportunity. Things have improved considerably since 2004, but we still have an unspoken agreement of don't ask, don't tell.

Guy was kind of a neckbeard (lived at home with his mom, in his 20s and never had a job, just spent most of his time at the computer) and when my husband and I got engaged, he completely dropped out of our lives, refusing to speak to either of us. Not a big loss for me, didn't get along with him that well. My husband was pretty upset for a while, he and this guy were casually writing a web comic together, and they had been friends for probably 7 years. 

So this guy walks in, and up to the head table. He reaches out and shakes my husband's hand but says, ""Mr.nancydrewskillz, you human piece of shit."" VERY LOUDLY. Loud enough for people sitting at nearby tables to hear. I said hi to him despite this, to be polite, and he made it a point to look at the wall directly behind me, and then walked away.

7193,"Astronomer here!  The fact that people like to argue that the fact that we don't see life everywhere we look means it doesn't exist beyond Earth, ie [the Fermi paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox).

See, the reason I have issues with this is I find the premise pretty messed up to begin with, ie the belief that we have measured the existence of alien life to any really measurable degree.  This is ludicrous because the sky is huge, and space is vast, and[ it's incredibly naive to think we can measure a civilization like us even at the nearest neighboring star](https://what-if.xkcd.com/47/).  The more I study astronomy the more I can think of so many reasons we have hardly scratched the surface on measuring the sky for something as subtle as alien life, and anyone who concludes from all this ""well, they must not be there at all!"" at this stage is being far too simplistic.

A good equivalent, to me, is the discovery of extrasolar planets.  Up until they were discovered in the early 90s, there were many astronomers who argued that extrasolar planets would be incredibly rare for this reason or that, before we could even really measure for them.  Now, just 20 years later, we know [nearly all stars have at least one planet](http://www.space.com/24894-exoplanets-habitable-zone-red-dwarfs.html), and that anyone who insisted otherwise before we could even really look was really jumping the gun far too early.

&gt;The greatest weight -

&gt;What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: ""This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence - even this spider and this moonlight between the trees, and even this moment and I myself. The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again, and you with it, speck of dust!""

&gt;Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: 'You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine... Or how well disposed would you have to become to yourself and to life to crave nothing more fervently than this ultimate eternal confirmation and seal?

I'm not sure if anyone has ever felt like no matter what, you are always a bother to someone, like if you want to talk to them you just feel like they are just chatting with you to be nice/or you feel like you're a nuisance to them...and this is something that has plagued me since 6th grade, and I even get this feeling from my own dad occasionally.

Second screwed up part about me is my depression, as in I always feel like I'm destined to fail no matter what, that my anxiety always makes me feel like I'm going to fail no matter how hard I try, and furthermore a first try ALWAYS has to be a perfect try no matter what. I've always wanted to be a cook, but how the hell can I do that when I'm constantly doubting myself whenever I try and cook stuff...hell, I can barely even seperate a egg yolk/white without panicking and breaking the yolk.

Finally, and this IMO is the worst part, but the near constant onslaught of suicidial thoughts I've had since 2011, and to this day I honestly just want to man up enough to pull the trigger and end it all. I'm not sure if any of you are religious, but I geniuenly hope there is something after...just where I can finally feel accepted, finally feel like I can chat with friends without feeling unwanted, and just be the son I know my dad wants. (and he can say oh his life would be nothing without me. I highly doubt that.) not to mention the time I nearly pulled the stunt off a few years back, but that's another story for another time.

Anyway, I highly doubt anyone is going to respond to this so feel free to respond or not, I just felt like getting some feelings off my chest I've had for the past 4-5 years.

7228,"I was actually supposed to meet my boyfriend about 15 years before I did. 

My dad is a cook and when I was 12 he would bring me to work with him the summer so he could drive me to music camp when the 9 am guy got there. I would get there at 6 am with him and help the guys prep French toast or whatever. Well there was this one cook, Narciso who started talking to me one day and said that he had two sons that were my age that I should meet when he brought them to America. I told him that sounded good and asked if they spoke English to which he said they didn't. So 12 year old me stomped over to my dad and announced that he needed to take me to the book store after school because I needed to learn Spanish for when Narciso's sons came to America. My dad laughed and joked with him that he tried teaching me Spanish for years but I wouldn't learn unless it was for a guy. Anyway, he brought me and every morning I would read the books and practice with the guys in the kitchen while I made French toast.


Time went on and music camp ended so I stopped going in and that was the end of that. Fast forward to 3 years ago, I was starting at a new restaurant and I get there and there's a cook I've known for years and I'm happy at least I've got a friend. Me and this mofo went back, like I bailed his stupid ass out of jail, back.  A couple months in he brings in his brother to start working and right off the bat I thought he was the sexiest man I've ever seen. He smiled and I knew I was done for. His first day he follows me to my car and asks me when I'm hanging out with him. It was pretty much all over after that. 

Fast forward again and he and his brother are on speaker phone with their dad and mention I'm there. His brother says, ""yeah you probably know her, actually, remember Tony? She's his daughter""

The phone got silent for a minute and he started laughing. At this point I still hadn't connected the dots yet because I'm quite clearly slow in the mental faculty department. When he finally spoke he said ""good I'm glad she finally found you guys."" My boyfriend was confused and he told him to never let me go because I was willing to help him before I even knew him. It was an odd situation.

7277,"My family made fun of me for a long time for rescuing a 9 year old corgi from the Humane Society. Everyone said I should have picked a younger dog. The way I see it, everyone wants a puppy so a 9 year old at the pound is very likely to be there for the rest of her life. If I didn't take her, there was a very good chance no one else ever would.

I never regretted it for an instant. I never had to deal with the crazy energetic puppy phase, she was already housebroken, and, as I loved to tell people, she came pre-loaded with tricks! The day I took her home she could sit, lie down, roll over, shake, high five, and fetch. You try adopting a puppy that can do all of that.

True, I didn't get as long with her as I would have with a puppy but the time I did have was all good. I don't have any memories of dealing with an obnoxious, frustrating puppy. True, she spent more of her life with another family before I met her than she did with me but you know what, she and I spent 6 amazing years together that I wouldn't trade for anything.

Goddamn it. I made myself cry."
7278,"Honestly, a lot of the time it's super fun. Especially now the kid is old enough to communicate and play games. Plus it's the weirdest thing that happens after they're born: it's like your hypnotized or some shit. Literally every fucking thing the little crotch fruit does is *the best* and *the cutest* and *melts my fucking heart*. Seriously, none of their disgusting shit bothers me. I've been elbow deep in diaper blow out and it doesn't bother me. I even picked a booger out of his nose yesterday. WHAT!?

I can't stand how much I love him - I want to burst. I thought I loved my dog and cat before but I don't know if this love is just so much more or I now have significantly less capacity for love in my heart now for things that are not genetically related to me. Plus seeing how much your partner adores the kid too is majorly heartwarming and a little libido booster (for me).

It has made me appreciate how fucking annoying my Mom is. Like, I get why she is the way she is with my brother and me. And I hope to fucking god I'm not like that with my kid when he grows up. But I don't really feel like I love and appreciate my parents more now that I've seen what they went through with us.

But yeah, for sure not for everyone, you definitely need a fuck tonne of patience. The first year was torture. Any idiot can bumble they way basically through parenting but kids deserve someone who is 100% involved and on their team."

7312,"Dull knives. As in knives that ought to be sharp but have been dulled with use.

Not the first answer I'd come up with because I was taught all knives are inherently dangerous and thus should show proper caution when using them. And yet I've been surprised by how many people I know who are just so willing to drop their guard when using a dull knife. Sometimes they'll even have a laugh when you tell them to be careful because it's a dull knife.

We all know why a sharp knife is dangerous. But dull knives are dangerous because they're unpredictable. A sharp knife will cut through that carrot/onion/meat/whatever the same way every time. But a dull knife might slip or, due to uneven wear on the blade, catch unexpectedly. When a dull knife cuts you the cut is going to be jagged and relatively difficult to put back together too.

Given the choice between the two, I'd rather deal with a straight, clean cut than the jagged, jankety mess your skin is going to be in after a dull cut."

7329,"This was related to me by a co-worker who worked on another production line at my plant.

There was a guy working on this line who just happened to be the son of that line's Foreman. From what I hear, he was a pretty decent worker - didn't try to use Daddy's clout to get away with shit.

There was a position on that line that needed a Lead Hand, but management was having trouble finding someone. So, the Foreman suggested, ""Just give it to my kid"". And they did - buddy swaps out his dirty yellow hardhat for a shiny new orange hardhat. And all is well... for a time.

One day, this guy overhears one of the crane operators talking shit about the Foreman - his Dad. Shortly afterwards, Daddy's Boy jumps the guy and starts beating the hell out of him. They're quickly pulled apart, and DB's supervisor brings him to HR.

Violence against co-workers on company property is a HUGE no-no. Don't bother grieving any discipline (suspension, firing), cuz the Union won't even take a second look at you. Obviously, if you were protecting yourself, that's different. Being the aggressor just gets you fucked.

DB meets with one of the HR managers, gets told that he's fired, and that the cops are on their way to book him on Assault charges. DB throws a fit, starts screaming at him and anyone nearby. The police arrive, and have to physically restrain him and drag him, kicking and screaming, out to a waiting cruiser.

By now, his Dad's heard the news, and has come charging over to HR. Seeing the chaos, he roars, ""Get the fuck out of here, and don't ever come back! You're a fucking embarrassment! I should never have gotten you that hat!"""

My mind the whole time would be spent thinking about the stuff I already knew would happen and how to make it better, and not what was actually happening at that moment.

I'd probably eventually console myself by reminding myself that I essentially am cheating at life because I retain all of my memories from what is going to happen if I do nothing different. This means I can make wise stock market investments, sports bets, and so on, and probably be a way cooler person to hang out with because I'd retain all my interests I acquired long after I left high school.

The glasses currently available are for red/green (there may be ones for blue/yellow so don't quote me on that), and they work by mellowing out the blues, yellows, and greens and making the reds pop more (this is why they are a reddish pink color). This allows us to be able to differentiate better between the colors, though not quite see them the same as someone with normal color vision. "

Finally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have a pink ping pong ball.' 

The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is a pink ping pong ball that you want, a pink ping pong ball you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his bithday present a pink ping pong ball. 

The boy took the ball to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong ball was gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong ball, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday. 

`Father,' replied the son, `I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. he said therefore, `If it is a tenpack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a tenpack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a tenpack of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy took the tenpack of balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ball remained, merely the empty husk of the tenpack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again. 

The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday. 

`Father,' said the son to this, `I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?' 

`A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed. 

`I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father, `but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.' 

And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls. 

The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared.

`Dear son,' said the father, `I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?' 

The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humour me, dear father.' 

The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. 

The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. 

`Dearest father,' the son started, `I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.' 

One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humour his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. 

The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home. 

The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left. 

The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong. 

`Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.' 

It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. 

The next day, the father took his son to the harbour and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there. 

`Father,' the son said, `You've made me very happy yet again.' 

That night, the son spent on board the tanker. 

The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy. 

A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital. 

His father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?' 

Weakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one tenpack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.' 

`Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.' 

The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk. 

`Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.' 

The son nodded weakly. 

The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room. 

`Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls,' the father requested. 

The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter. 

`I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth. 

`I- I-' 

Then he died.

7438,"My family adopted a old black lab, she was 12 years old and the shelter people pretty much let my family take her home for like $50 because they were so convinced she was going to slowly rot away and die in the no kill shelter because she got worse and worse by the day. The shelter worker we were talking to pretty much cut the deal because she didn't look like she had more than a few months left and after my mom and I heard her story we were crying. Her owners abandoned her and said they didn't have time for her anymore. She wouldn't stop howling for her old owners to take her back, so the shelter workers moved her into a solitary confinement room so she wouldn't stress the others dogs out. I remember peeping in the door, and seeing this dog howling right by the window with these absolutely dead eyes. She could hardly walk, and couldn't move her tail at all. We took her home that day in the summer not expecting her to last the winter.

At first, she cried nonstop and my mom and I wondered if we made the right decision. But, we were patient and let her warm up to us. After a lot of swimming in our pond, she started running around the yard. Then after she could run around the yard, she started wagging her tail again. When joggers would run by, she'd poke her head out the fence with my eight year old dog, and everyone always thought she was the younger one. She had so much personality!

She died when she was 14, one morning her stomach flipped suddenly and that was it. But when I cried, I cried because I was happy too. I thought of the dog she was when I first saw her, then to how she thumped her tail when I said ""Goodnight Belle!"" and headed off to my room on her last night. Loving that dog has been more of a learning experience than any other animal I've owned in my life, and I think you'd really grow from it too. There was nothing more amazing than breathing life back into that dog that the shelter workers practically gave away to us because they thought she was on death's door.

Basically... if you have the means to do it, definitely give it a try.

7586,"I don't know if this counts as a math fact, but it's my favorite math puzzle. I guess the fact would be the solution. Anyway, it would be the Konigsburg Bridge Problem.

It's an interesting mathematics puzzle that laid the foundation for graph theory. I remember going through it once in school for reasons that I can't quite remember now.

The problem from the outset is pretty simple. You have four landmasses with a series of seven bridges between them, [pictured here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Konigsberg_bridges.png). Now, what you need to do is find a path that will cross each bridge exactly once. Try it out for a minute and see how you do.

Now that you're back, you're probably telling me that it's impossible. Well, you're right. So now, the question is, why? Why can you not cross each of the bridges exactly once? I'll give you some hints if you need them, but try and figure it out.

**Hint #1:** [Draw the landmasses as nodes and the bridges as lines between them. If you don't know what I mean by that, [here's an example](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/K%C3%B6nigsberg_graph.svg).](#s)

**Hint #2:** [Add one bridge and try to find a route that will go across all eight of these bridges. Give it a minute and you'll be able to find a path](#s)

**Hint #3:** [Count how many bridges each island has. What do you notice about the numbers? What changes when the eighth bridge was added in Hint #2](#s)

**Hint #4:** [Other than the start and end point, when you cross a bridge to get to an island, you must also cross one to leave. What does this mean for each non-endpoint bridge?](#s)

**Solution:** [In order to cross all of the bridges between any number of landmasses exactly once, you must have exactly 0 or 2 landmasses which have an odd number of bridges. The reason for this is that each time you enter a new landmass, you must also leave it to go to the next one, meaning that you will cross an even number of bridges each time. The exception is the start and endpoints. In those cases you either don't have to enter or don't have to leave. If you have two landmasses with an odd number, you will start and finish in different places. If you have none, you can start and finish anywhere.](#s)"

My Soot was fifteen or so and developed something (20 years later I've forgotten exactly what).  The vet said she could be treated, but it would require about a week's time hospitalized. This was a cat who would have never left my bed if I'd put a litterbox and food in it. She slept on top of me. 

She spent a week in the hospital. I visited her every day, and would hold her for as long as they would let me use an exam room. Sometimes hours. She cried piteously when they took her away, back to her cage. 

Finally she was well and was allowed home. She relapsed after a month and this time the vet said that we could do it again, but it would just prolong the inevitable. I thought of my poor baby locked up away from me and stuck with needles daily, crying for me. And for what? For four more weeks, or two? I just couldn't do it to her. 

I adopted her at four, and we had eleven long years together. I gave her food and treats and my loving companionship. I also gave her an easy, painless death in my arms. Never feel guilty for sparing an animal pain. Letting them go gently is the last act of living kindness we can grant them. "

He enjoyed the work, shootin' the shit with his fellows, and seeing the world.  He didn't want to go to war and being in logistics -- didn't expect to have a direct impact on him.

Then orders came down to round up the 'undesirables'.  He decided he didn't want to be a part of it anymore.  He ""saw who we were and who we became"" and he didn't recognize himself anymore.  Also he was madly in love with a Romanian gypsy girl who would have been one of those rounded up and interred.  As he told it: ""Is this girl worth running halfway 'round the world for?  Yes.  So I grabbed your, Nan, and said we're gettin' out of here.""  He fled to the States with her to work on his cousin's farm.

She took me to an after hours (where I fought off  an assault) and then took me to a big party afterword (which I don't remember because I was blacked out) because she was dead set on ""meeting a man"". I threw up at the second location, and she got angry at me the next day for it because I'd ""made a mess"". She sabotaged a relationship of mine and got her friend to help her bully me about it me to the point where I had residual mental issues. She slept with people I was interested in romantically. She'd get buddy with my friends. She totaled my car during a DUI, lied to me about the extent of the damage, and then flipped out on me for asking her to be reimbursed for this (and also tried to turn our parents against me).

My other sister would routinely lock me in closets when I was a toddler, pour milk on my head, and gave me alcohol as a very young child.

7740,"True. We have such a distorted view of what our ancestors moral view actually was, people were far more pragmatic then we think.

I was looking at some church records online for a distant ancestor of mine who was alive in the 1600s. Lets call him Thomas.

He got married in February and their baby was baptised just a short time later in April. Sadly his wife was buried mere weeks after that in May and the baby only survived a few more.

I was sat at home reflecting with great sadness upon how devastated poor Thomas must have been to have been so happy to be married with a baby, only to lose it all months later. I imagined him a poor grief stricken widow.

Then I looked down the record and saw that he got married again in about September of the same year. Fair enough I thought, he's a young man it was only fit that he moved on. 

Their child was baptised the following March. 

Those of you who are good at maths will realise that I was somewhat nonplused to find that dear grief stricken Thomas must have almost immediately started 'visiting' his new lady friend in the weeks after his first wife died to have managed all that on such a strict timescale. 

I didn't know whether to be shocked by his callousness or impressed by his stamina. "

And they could never get anything right.  They fucked up cultural relations with Rolf.  Kevin was always dicking them over, and so was Sara.  Nazz was utterly unobtainable.  The only people that honestly liked them were the Canker sisters, who were probably the only characters on the show more hated than the Eds.

But no matter how many times life would knock them down, the Eds would charge forward again with a new scheme.  They'd stick together, compensate for each other's weaknesses, and play on each other's strengths (Eddy's schemes gave Ed and Double D an outlet for their inhuman strength and brilliance, respectively), and kept any of the boys from being totally isolated.  To me, that was the beauty of the show; that you had these three kids that were total outcasts in society, but somehow still got up each day, went outside, and found a reason to smile."

7819,"&gt; satisfaction of seeing it through and finished is wayyyyyyyy better than anything else

I decided to renovate my laundry. I took down the big antique solid steel (not connected) gas heater myself, and dropped it on the sink. Well, the sink needed replacing anyway. Then, I spent a hot, sweaty, dusty day demolishing a brick wall that was part of the old shower recess. Then, I went to the local big-box hardware store to ask for advice on removing the old textured paint. I didn't want to grind it off and fill my lungs with lead paint dust and possibly asbestos. They recommended to paint over it with some fancy-shmancy textured dulux render paint. ""They"" means every staff member I spoke to. ""It'll be easy!"" ""This is great stuff!"" I bought four tubs of the paint, lots of plastic sheets, rendering floats, everything I needed, watched lots of Youtube videos and I was ready. Then began the worst weekends of my life. I'd slap the render paint on, smooth it over, and over, and over, and over until it was still lumpy and streaky. I'd smooth it over again. And over. It got in my hair, on the window frames, the ceiling. I kept running out of paint and having to buy new tubs at $140 each. Finally, I took down the plastic sheets after the paint had dried, to behold my handiwork. My lumpy, streaky, ugly handiwork.

We paid someone to tile the floor and install flatpack laundry cabinets. At least they looked good. Two years later, my expensive render paint was peeling off the wall - it was too heavy for the textured paint underneath it to hold. So I decided I'd peel it off, and pay a plasterer. It started coming off in great big heavy sheets, until it didn't. Then began the worst weekends of my life. Hours and hours chiseling off this render paint with a hammer drill, an hour to a square foot sometimes, filling the kitchen, my hair, everything else with concrete dust. Two years later, we got a plasterer in to give a quote. He said ""No, you really ought to put up gyprock or plasterboard. And no, I don't do that."" I went to the big box hardware store and spoke to a salesperson. ""Yeah, you should use plasterboard or gyprock. It'll be easy. It's great stuff. Imagine the sense of pride and satisfaction at seeing it finished!"" 

No, thanks, I've tasted pride and satisfaction. Pride tastes like dust, dust, dust; concrete, paint and brick dust on hot summer Sundays. Satisfaction tastes like a warm cup of chamomile tea sipped as I transfer money to a tradie's bank account. 

Edit: clarity"
7820,"Honestly, I thought the same thing until I bought both the Mr. Clean and a no name dollar store brand. 

Had to go through a lot cleaning out a filthy new apartment - the Mr. Clean ones ended up being cheaper because they could take way more punishment for the tougher jobs. The cheap ones disintegrated too fast when I had to actually scrub. 

Mr. Clean has higher standards I guess. "
7821,"It doesn't.  And, more than that, the price of ingredients can vary a lot based on quality.

Generally, dough is cheap.  It's just 50lb bags of flour, water, oil, a bit of yeast, salt, maybe sugar, sometimes cornmeal for the bottom.  You're talking maybe a $10 investment for large NY style 100 pizzas.  Maybe $0.10 per pizza.  Fucking gluten free costs *a lot more*, like maybe $60 for 200 pizzas.  So for these, it's more like $0.60 per pizza.

Now, that's just the dough.  Then there's the sauce.  There's a lot of variation in sauce ingredient quality and therefore a lot of variation in price.  You can get 8 or 10 6 pound cans of crushed tomatoes and tomato paste, water it down, throw some oil, salt and cheap oregano and maybe a couple other spices in there, mix it in what amounts to a large plastic trash barrel, and serve that shit for 1,000 pies easy and cheap.  Maybe $0.30 per pizza.

Or you can get peeled San Marzanos and Plum tomatoes and crush them yourself and shred fresh herbs and spices yourself in smaller daily batches and go through all the hell of getting a really good sauce just right.  This will cost you easily 10 times more than going the cheap way.  That's right, you can end up spending $3.00 per pizza on a sauce to put on a $0.10 dough.  So it goes.

Then you've got cheese.  Again, there's a good bit of quality variation here.  Mozzarella cheese prices vary a lot too.  You can get average quality for maybe $3/lb now.  A couple years ago it was $5/lb.  And it varies quickly.  So you need to just assume that the price is high if you don't want to end up in trouble when it inevitably spikes.  And different places use different amounts.  This is probably the easiest thing to skimp on, but that can piss customers off too.  I'd ballpark another $2.50 here.  But you can easily spend $5 if you want, or you might be able to pull off $1.  Again, quality and quantity variation.

So, maybe at the cheapest for an average large cheese NY pizza (about 18"" thin), you're looking at about $3 in food costs.  But then you've got to have a box.  That might be about $0.50.  And you've got to burn gas all day to keep the big old pizza oven at very high temperatures.  And you've got to do all the water heating and cooling and refrigerating and all that.  So electric and gas costs are high.  Plus you've got to pay employees to make the stuff.  And maybe the biggest cost of all depending on where you are is rent.  You've got to rent the pizza joint.  That can cost thousands per month easily.  And you've got to buy the big dough mixer and oven and refrigerators and you'll have monthly payments for those too.

If you pull in 10% margin, maybe that's all you get.

So if you're selling an average large cheese for $15, it might break down something like this:

$3.00 rent cost  
$3.00 labor cost  
$3.00 food cost    
$1.50 profit    
$1.50 gas cost    
$1.00 capital costs  
$1.00 electric cost  
$0.50 box cost   
$0.50 incidental costs  

And there you go, that's probably a somewhat realistic estimate of what you are actually paying for when you buy the pizza.

And when i wasolder she would say she didn't love me and she didn't think anyone ever would.  I was unlovable.

Anyway, it surfaced during a pre-spring cleaning a few months ago, so I grabbed the kids so they could stab themselves and draw blood (why not).  Everyone was fine until we got to my youngest, who's level was 290.  Internal panic, external 'whoa! she beat us all!'.  Tried again the next day, 245 :(

So, upside, we found it before anything really problematic started.  Downside, the endocrinology clinic had a hard time figuring out how to handle it because most of their new type 1's come in with sugar at 750 and are in DKA.

7883,"My mom, who was only 32, had a complete breakdown. We (have a sister who was 10 at the time) moved out of our apartment and in with my maternal grandparents, who took over raising us for nearly a year while my mom stayed closed away in a bedroom grieving. Though she was in the same house, I remember I didn't see her at all for weeks at a time. And remember talking to her through a closed door about something that happened in school. Fortunately we had a very close relationship with my grandparents and they were excellent substitute parents, providing everything we needed while my mom could not; complete emotional and financial support. Eventually my mom pulled it together and got a great paying job. With the life insurance payout she bought us a house, a car and 2 grand pianos (one each for step dad's sis and mom, all 3 of them were concert pianists). My step dad had been in insurance so he was more than adequately insured, had no children of his own and was only 33 when he died so my mom got it all. While it was happening, I was kind of numb about grieving, processing it. Though he was a sweet man, my parents had only been divorced a short time when mom and my stepdad got together and I think I felt like I would be disloyal to my dad if I got really close to my stepdad. Obviously it would have been a lot worse if my grandparents had not been there for us. 

As the years have passed I realize I have a underlying fear that those I love, my son, my boyfriend, my mom, could be taken from me in a moment and it makes me anxious and at times overly protective. I saw happiness snatched right away from them and I know it can happen again. Before it was announced that Prince had died possibly from a drug issue, I was in a panic because I thought he had just dropped dead out of the blue and that ""happiness snatched away in a moment"" terror wrecked me for a day or so. I try not to let it control me but every once in awhile it grabs ahold of me and I imagine it will continue to do so the older I get."

The temp agency then screwed up and called her right at her desk to let her know that she would not be working on that contract next week - which set her off on a crying and screaming fit. Just as security got there with a couple of cardboard filing boxes to escort her out, she takes a half-full bottle of nail polish remover out of her desk drawer and douses her desk with it - and before security can grab her - she lights it with a pack of matches - whoosh! She's tackled - security guy tosses his flammable windbreaker on the desk, making the fire even worse - and then we just started a gradual evacuation towards the parking lot on our own - the people on my team, that is. This was in the middle of a large, modern call center-like operation - so about 200 or more people are in the vicinity of this as it's going down. I went out to my car and smoked a one hitter or six as we waited for police and fire to roll on up and take care of business after that. I got paid a full day for a 4 hour shift, too - so that was nice.

7944,"&gt;**Q:** Is it proper for women to be learned?

&gt;**A:** All grant that they may have some learning, but the question is of what sort, and to what degree? Some indeed think they have learned enough if they can distinguish between their husband's breeches and another man's... Others think they may pardonably enough read, but by no means be trifled with writing. Others again, that they ought neither to write nor read. A degree yet higher are those who would have them read plays, novels, and romances—with perhaps a little history, but by all means terminating their studies there, and not letting them meddle with philosophy... because it takes them off from their domestic affairs and because it generally fills them of themselves ... **'tis a weakness common to our own sex as well as theirs... We see no reason why women should not be learned now.

Wouldn't it be better to park the Galactica on the dark side of the moon - you know, just in case?

The flash forward to present day with Baltar and Six was good. But apart from that the last seasons were very frustrating.

I've rewatched my Battlestar Galactica dvd collection probably dozens of times now. I've got the the point where I always lose interest after the storming of New Caprica. This is probably the one show that I would rather read the fan fiction ending (Galactica on the dark side of the moon, where the Apollo missions discover it, leading to another cycle of ""all this has happened before and will happen again"").

EDIT: For everyone asking about the fanfic.. Sorry I can't deliver. I watched the final episode years ago when it first aired, and spent some time on IMDB and a few other TV-centric forums discussing the ending. The fanfics were linked there. I tried googling the specific one that I referred to (my favorite involving the Galactica being stored on the dark side of the moon and then discovered by modern humans during the Apollo missions, and the implication that the discovery of the Galactica is what is fuelling our technological growth), but Google doesn't bring up anything even mildly relevant. It's a shame. I accept that as my personal canon. It flows nicely with the ending showing Six, Baltar and all the technological advancements humanity is making."

7990,"When I was around ten there was this kid at my school a few grades younger, probably about six who liked to hang out with me and my friends. He was hyperactive and kind of amusing but he had this weird fixation on sex, if we were playing a game and one of us fell into the dirt he'd come over and start humping us. Once I was standing against a wall and he just walked over and started grinding on me, this was constant and it got to the point where we just kind of distanced ourselves from him. We never really thought anything of it, just that this little serial humper and sex obsessed child was slightly annoying.

It didn't occur to me later that a kid as young as six should even know what sex was. We never taught it to him, he was like that when we met him. This wasn't normal childhood experimentation, this kid knew more about sex than most of us did. I felt sick when I finally looked back on him and realized that something fucked up must have been going on for a six year old kid to be acting like that. Like really fucked up."

8047,"Edit: I think people are kinda getting the wrong idea with what I mean when I say that the Revolutionary War didn't have a dramatic direct effect on the UK. As far as I'm aware, the majority of the British population at the time supported American Independence, as the place was so far away, but basically just full of British and Irish settlers. As both the major conflicts in the US are viewed more as a part of a larger conflict, and because the outcome of losing wasn't particularly negative, it's not really important enough to be talked about.

Honestly, it's not really talked about much. Not because of any sort of negative feelings toward the outcome, just because the direct effect it had on the UK was basically non-existent. I suppose it's called the War of American Independence, but on the scale of important wars that the UK has been involved in, it's pretty far down the list. 

Both World Wars, all 17 billion wars against France, all the English Civil Wars (War of the Roses, Jacobite Rebellions etc), Boer War, the Opium Wars etc etc. The war of 1812, while seen as an independent conflict in the US, is usually viewed as a minor theater in the Napoleonic wars in Europe. Actually I think that's probably why it's not really seen as all too important, every major conflict between the US and the UK has occurred during a period in which the UK was in a larger conflict with other major powers of the time (usually France)."

So I was camping with a few friends, and there was a silent auction going on in a nearby building. The auction ended very late, like 2 am, so I wen back to our tent early and fell asleep by accident. When my friends came back after the auction, they saw that I was asleep, so one whispered to the other ""don't make too much noise"". I then said ""HELLO?"". The thing is, I don't remember saying that. I don't remember anything. So one of them says hi and then turns his flashlight on my face. I was lying on my back, with my head over the side of my bunk. My eyes were rolled back into my skull so all you could see was white. I kept yelling ""HELLO"" to them but I wouldn't respond to anything they said, so they ran out of the tent.


A few minutes later I woke up, and went back to the auction because I didn't know it had ended. I had no memory of what I had done. They then come back to the tent and see that *I was no longer there*. One of them freaks out and they go to the nearest tent, which was between our tent and the auction, to look for help.


I'm walking back, a little confused because the auction was over, but I hadn't seen them in the tent. They saw me walking towards them in the darkness and they and called out ""NoFittingName? Is that you?"" to which I replied, since I was pretty far away, ""HELLO?""

There are solutions, both historical and modern, for making phage therapy work in spite of their extraordinary specificity, which is easier in some systems like Staph where Staph phage K-like phage hit routinely hit more than 80% of clinical isolates than others.

The first is to pre-generate cocktails of vast numbers of phages as they do in the Republic of Georgia at the Eliava Institute and BioChimPharm. At Eliava, they have three cocktails of phages that they update every 6 months against strains that they collect from around the country and don't really have a way to keep track of the functionally infinite number of phage strains [that have been evolving in the cocktail since the 1930s](http://www.metafilter.com/134210/Imagining-the-Post-Antibiotics-Future#5305117). The first is intestiphage, which targets 20 different types of gastrointestinal diseases. [One well-controlled trial of the concept](http://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/bacteriophage/AbedonBP1-2.pdf) was conducted in Tbilisi on 30,769 children back in the sixties, neighborhoods were split up with one side of each street treated prophylactically with a phage cocktail and the other a placebo. The result was a 3.8-fold decrease in dysentery incidence. A second cocktail, pyophage, is made against Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, Proteus, E. coli, and Enterococcus, the 6 major causes of purulent infections, it is used prophylactically on surfaces and wounds on a routine bases during surgery and for severe burns as well as against actively purulent wounds (like MRSA) with a high success rate. During the the most recent couple of wars there, soldiers carried spray bottles of phage for gunshot wounds and maintained shockingly low infection rates. The third is a relatively new one against prostititis. 

While this maybe effective against most types of infections, and is pretty clearly at least mostly safe, there are good reasons why this strategy will probably never be used in the West for over coming resistance. The only reports of adverse effects I've ever seen come from an abstract, for a long lost paper presented at a conference during the time that phage technology was considered a Soviet military secret, that described injecting volunteered conscripts with 10^6 times the therapeutic dose, which is generally applied topically, and they only got fevers; but there are very important theoretical harms. Many strains of pathogenic S. aureus as well as E. coli O157:H7 of Jack in the Box fame, Shigella, cholera, botulism, diphtheria, scarlet fever, and a whole bunch of described shrimp and insect diseases are in a sense not really caused by those bacteria but by the phages that infect them. Essentially, all active phages can go through what is called a lytic life cycle when they infect a cell, shut down host metabolism and substitute it for their own, replicate their DNA, construct and pack viral particles, and then explode the cell for the new particles to hunt for more cells. This is obviously extremely lethal, which is great for us, but some phages (known as temperate phages and somewhat analogous to retroviruses) can also go through a lysogenic life cycle where instead of shutting down the hosts' metabolism, they turn off their genomes and wait. This creates what are call lysogens, sort of a phage/bacteria hybrid, where the phage hides and lets the host replicate it with its own chromosome when it divides. Now these temperate phages have an interest in their hosts doing well and sometimes have exotic genes, which get expressed independently of the host lethal ones, that often contribute to host success in weird situations, like pathogenesis. Thus, for example, cholera isn't really caused by Vibrio cholerae like many of us may have heard but instead by the CTX-φ and TLC-φ phages. Vibrio are, for the most part, planktonic marine bacteria content to scavenge for low levels of exotic organic substrates in the oceans and leave us well enough alone. However, when infected by the temperate CTX-φ and TLC-φ phages, Vibrio cholerae suddenly gets a pathogenicity cassette of DNA with a type IV pillus (basically the business end of a phage on a string) and the profoundly nasty cholera toxin. Vibrio cholerae is like the pleasant dude who rolls around on the back of a truck in a jumpsuit picking up the garbage in front of your home, CTX-φ is the agent that turns him into a poison-syringe/grappling-hook wielding madman looking to feed off of your guts. These kinds of phage that are capable of going through this secondary type of lifecycle are pretty trivial to detect and avoid with pure phage stocks using modern sequencing but, while it is clear that the classical microbiology the Eliava uses strongly selects against them, there is absolutely no way to guarantee that they are not present in their ancient preparations even if they've never been reported.

For alternatives, there is also what they do in Wroclaw, Poland at the Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy. There they treat intractable infections resistant to all other treatment methods with phage preparations that are specifically designed for the strain causing the infection by isolating lytic phage specific to the infection in question. They have success rates that range between 50% and 100% of cases, depending on the type of infection, and publish their findings in English. They suspect that the relatively low success rates with some kinds of infections has to do with the fact that most infections, by the time they see them, have had months, and more often years, to develop solid biofilms and avascular hiding places.

The solution favored by Western companies, the current front runners being AmpliPhi Biosciences taking the capitalistic approach, Nestle taking the socially responsible approach, and PhagoBurn taking the socialist approach is to isolate and characterize &gt;5 phages with unusually broad host ranges. Indeed, a cocktail like this is now being used in just about all pre-cooked ""ready to eat meats"" (think baloney) on grocery store shelves now to prevent Lysteria and prolong shelf life. If you'd like a more in depth, but still accessible, run down of where we are as a community, where we've come from, and where we're going; [the best review at the moment is still one that I should disclose that I am an author on.](http://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/bacteriophage/AbedonBP1-2.pdf)

There is also a very interesting wild card approach being advanced by Crag Venter's Synthetic Genomics, where they are taking well studied type phages and genetically engineering them with features from other phage to expand their host range and prevent resistant mutants. Really the biggest reason why phage can infect some hosts of a given species and not others has everything to do with just the mechanics of binding. Phage particles are locked in a dynamic where binding to hosts they cannot productively infect is suicide, but failing to bind to a host they can infect is a massive wasted opportunity, while at the same time bacteria are constantly changing the unique contents of their outer membranes to avoid phage predation. Genetically engineering phage to bind to more hosts than they could ever be naturally selected to is pretty exciting, particularly as it would have advantages for patentability, and a reduced need to do testing for the large numbers of phage needed for constantly replenished cocktails.

Phage will never be as convenient as antibiotics, they will always rely on diagnostic infrastructure capable of generating at least a good guess at phage type, in a developing world context they need to be kept cold, they won't ever be 100% effective in the way new antibiotics used to be, and they will necessarily involve understanding the systems we're manipulating in a much deeper way. But as sequencing resources becomes increasingly available for diagnostic use, culture dependent methods will become increasingly unnecessary, and the last big hurdle to widespread phage use for a lot of infections will fall away.

When my father died last year, I cried for a few minutes.  Then I just numbed out for the rest of the day.  Then that night it suddenly hit me hard and I cried for hours, I reached out to close friends because I needed to talk to someone about it who wasn't family and wasn't suffering as I was.  To just be able to get it out without worrying about the feelings of the person I was talking to.

After that day though, including the service, I kept that shit bottled up.  Because in addition to losing a loved one, you suddenly have all these responsibilities.  I needed to make arrangements for the services, I needed to notify family, friends, banks, insurance.  I needed to work at all this fucking bureaucratic crap while at the same time every time I mentioned his name to somebody on the phone, I'm trying not to get into something that's going to make me start crying again.  I'm trying to look strong for other people in the family, because I want them to feel they can rely on me, that I'm not being overwhelmed.  But I fucking was overwhelmed.  There's no way around that.  I just wasn't going to show it.

By the time the day of the service came, I probably was curt with people.  I didn't cry.  And I really did feel like I just wanted all of that stuff to be over, I may even have said so to people, but that doesn't mean I didn't love my father deeply. It didn't mean that I wasn't still wondering what the hell my life was going to be like now that I couldn't just pick up the phone and give him a call whenever I felt like it.  If you were just watching me and talking to me that day though, you wouldn't have known it."

8207,"This one's fairly depressing. 

After my parents divorced my mother had custody of the kids, but my dad would come and pick me and my brothers up on Saturday afternoons for a couple of hours. We would usually go to the comic book store and Pizza Hut or something, and then he'd take us home. My mom had mental problems and was abusive, so these visits were the highlight of my week. 

Some weeks my dad just never showed up, and I waited for him as it became more and more obvious he wasn't going to show up, which meant that I wouldn't get pizza and I wouldn't go to the comic book store that week and my mom would be pissed off all day because she'd have to stay home and take care of four kids unexpectedly. Those were really bad days.   

One day he came to pick us up, and we were out of the house for maybe half an hour, and he pulled his station wagon over to the side of the road and started crying. My brothers and I had no idea what was going on, and we were too afraid to ask. After a little while he composed himself and in a clear voice stated, ""Children, I've wet myself."" He told us that he was going to take us back to our house and drop us off with our mother, and then he would go home for the day. I begged him to just go back to his house and change his pants, and we could still spend the day together. He wouldn't do it. Not too long after that he stopped showing up for visits altogether. 

It's one of my most vivid memories, but as strange as it sounds, I never really questioned why my father pissed himself that day. I knew that my dad struggled with alcoholism throughout his life, but it was only in the past few years that I put two and two together and realized that my father was either drunk or drying out that day.

8209,"I can't believe I had to scroll down so far to find Language!

Language is utterly fascinating and so completely human. We've been communicating with language for thousands of years. Even just analyzing *currently* used languages in the past forty years (~6000 depending on your personal definition of ""language""), linguists are constantly finding remarkable things. Imagine what having complete data from the past several thousand could enlighten.

There are so many fascinating aspects. You mention the sounds. I speak English, and I push air through several kind of weird organs (not all of which have clear purposes other than speech!), and constrict and vibrate air. Without any pauses or breaks, you take that blunder of air and decode it into ""sound"", and then those sounds make morphemes and words, and those words make phrases and those phrases make bigger phrases and combine to form meanings and utterances. But not all language is audio-based! There is also the orthographic aspect -- you take weird squiggles and see them with your eyes and know how to map them to words that, especially for English, have very little to do with the word other than historical influences and a couple of vague orthographic-phonetic tendencies. And there's also sign languages -- a massively complex family of languages that all communicate with the hands and the eyes and the face and the visual space at the same time, to the point that sign language orthographies, if they even exist, are painfully complex and rarely employed.

This doesn't even get into socio-linguistic interpretations of speakers, where you experience some language and have a sense of the speaker's background or the context in which the utterance was conveyed. There's the complexity of lying and performative verbs (I now declare you...). There's the syntax of all sorts of weird phenomena from dummy subjects (like the ""There"" in this sentence) to theoretical universalist grammars that try to tie together the entire Language Faculty.

Language is ingrained in literally every single aspect of daily life for almost every single human being from their first to their last breath. It's mind boggling and complicated and mysterious and just somehow seems to *work* for us.

But maybe I'm a little more impassioned than usual because about 10 hours ago I officially received my B.A. in Linguistics, so..."
8210,"I always assume people don't actually want to hang out or talk to me.

Like, I know that probably isn't the case...but at the same time, it probably is. I know it's my own self-esteem issues I need to work on, but any time I hang out with someone, I can think of no reason why they would want to hang out with me. I hang out with them because they're nice, or funny, or we do cool stuff together. But am I really any of those things? I like to think I am, but I don't think I am to the degree that someone would actually *want* to hang out with me.

Every time I leave a friend's house or some type of get together, there is always that nagging thought that they really wouldn't have cared if I didn't show up. "

8212,"&gt; He's probably the most unbelievable part of the entire show; who the hell would stay friends with him?!

You would be surprised. Especially in ""nerd"" groups there is usually a Sheldon or Sheldon-type person. You keep them around because they are relatable in some way (I, personally, love rules and feel like they should be followed), are good to have around when gaming for rules/general knowledge, and they make you feel better about yourself by being ""better"" compared to him/her.

There's also the fact that virtually none of what he does is malicious. He does things because they make sense to him and he literally doesn't understand why an action is/isn't appropriate in a social setting. There are a lot of people like that, although obviously Sheldon is a exaggeration of that. It's also rare that a single person would have all of the quirks that he does (genius, OCD, germaphobia, complete social inawareness, etc.) but the writers wanted those traits to be present so just squished everything into Sheldon.

Let's also keep in mind that Sheldon season 1 is vastly different than Sheldon current season. He's actually shown more growth than the rest of the cast (almost combined) and has always been more open minded than any other character"

I had a cop ask me why I was addressing a guy as ""sir"" who had just been arrested for trespassing and breaking and entering along with possession of heroin. The guy had a real medical complaint regarding an injury that was very obvious should have been addressed a few days before from something unrelated to the current incident. I told the officer that I didn't care if this guy was the biggest scumbag on earth he's still a human being who needs help both for his injury and his addiction. Why would I act any less professionally towards him than I would any other patient? Even if it's just a typical drug seeker we pick up, I might be pretty skeptical and know exactly what's going on but I'm not going to act any differently toward that patient than any other.

Last year while I was teaching English in South Korea, my school was on the second floor of a building that had a few restaurants and a hair salon on the ground floor. The salon owner had a cat that he just let wander around. The cat was super cool, really really friendly. There were a couple schools for different subjects also in the building, but the cat liked to hang out in the park next to the building, and the kids loved him. He'd get huge crowds of kids around him petting him and playing with him, and he'd just chill with em. Friendliest cat you ever met. One day I was getting to school and he was sitting outside on the sidewalk between the park and the building. There were 2 little girls who were petting him. As I got closer one of the girls kicked him. He backed up and looked at here like ""wtf.. what was that for?"" The girls giggled, and kicked him again. Again he backed up a step or 2 and just gave them that ""wtf"" look. Giggles, and they kicked him a 3rd time, at which point I yelled at them and started to chew them out in a mix of my broken Korean and English. As a little Korean child, a huge white foreign guy suddenly yelling at you half in a language you don't understand must be an absolutely terrifying experience. 

I actually caught kids picking on him (throwing shit at him, kicking him, etc) several times. Never once did the cat so much as hiss at them. He just backed away and looked at them like ""why are you doing that?"" I felt it was my duty to that little guy to scare the shit out of those kids so they think twice about doing shit like that. "

Society at large tends to think of the act itself as dirty (for obvious reasons) so merely taking part in such an activity can be a rush of doing something forbidden. Much in the same way some people enjoy sex in a public place where the possibility of being caught is real.

It also comes from changing it up every now and then. If you're bent over and getting railed doggy style, it becomes a completely different act if it's vaginal vs anal. Sex is great, but if you do the same thing every time, it can get boring. Anal is a relatively simple way to spice things up without requiring a ton of accoutrements, you just need some lube and trust."

There was no one but me and my dad for miles in any direction. So I thought. 

I suddenly heard voices in the distance and stopped in my tracks. It seemed to be coming from my right, deep in the woods in the middle of nowhere a quarter of a mile from the road. Being 11 and unafraid of the world, I foolishly yelled ""Who's out there?""

There was silence for a few seconds, then a shouted string of profanity so vulgar it terrified my virgin ears. 

I stood stock still for a moment like a terrified rabbit but heard nothing else, so I ran back to the house and woke my dad up. He got up, loaded his gun, and turned all the lights on, but we never heard another sound.

She was super judgy about the whole ordeal because it dealt with porn and I couldn't have cared less about the content I just didn't want to be sued.  

I knew I could just ignore it and it would go away, I eventually contacted a lawer who specializes in these troll cases and even he suggested I settle after warning me that I could probably just ignore it.  He said the judge in my area who would end up handling the case was very anti-piracy and if it did go to court (and a previous case had) I would likely lose and have to shell out 4x the amount I could settle for.  I didn't want it hanging over my head and had the money lying around so I just settled.

Ended up costing my $6,000 to settle and $1,800 in legal fees.  It sucked and broke my budget for years but I think I made the best decision I could at the time given that copyright trolls were a very new thing back then.

I really didn't want to have that kind of pressure on our family if I could avoid it. Long story short(er), I gave in and we decided to go for it. Our daughter was only getting older and I didn't want a huge age gap between the two. Our son is almost six now and he's the smartest, funniest little fucker I know.


Edit: When we found out she was pregnant the doctor told us our son had been conceived about a month before we started trying. We couldn't even plan to have a baby without fucking it up."

8435,"So, when I was little, our town was hit by a tornado. It was the only cloud in the sky, and it took seemingly forever to get through town. My grandparents came and got us (mom, me, little sis, and my little cousin), and we drove out of town away from the storm (I had a teacher tell me I was lying about this, but this tornado was unusually slow, and is on record as being unusually slow). My grandpa didn't want us kids to even hear the storm, let alone be caught in it. We watched it from a nearby safe location, and I still remember feeling my heart stop when a landmark near our house disappeared in the storm. My dad hadn't made it home from work before we left (we were waiting for him until we couldn't wait any longer). My mom and sister and I cried all the way home, thinking my dad was gone. 

When we pulled up the house and it was still there, and my dad came running out... Honestly, it was the best feeling ever, followed by the second best feeling to a 7-year old when my best friend and her family came running through the backyard, safe as well. My great-grandpa wasn't so lucky, but in those first few minutes, it seemed everything would be okay (he had 2 broken legs- he got blown down the stairs to the basement, house was pretty destroyed. He died less than a year later due to lung issues from the storm. We lost quite a few of the elderly folks to the same thing.)

Anyway, this was the actual WTF moment...

My dad was still at work (mechanic &amp; tow-truck driver, and a volunteer fireman) when it started, and he booked it home and proceeded to take a shower in the basement bathroom. For years we gave him shit about taking a shower during a tornado, then watching the freaking tornado with a towel wrapped around his waist. We couldn't understand why the heck he took a shower instead of taking cover. It became one of those stories we told whenever the topic of the tornado came up. ""Did you know my dad watched the whole thing with a towel around his waist??"" Hahahaha.

Finally, many years later, on the anniversary of this tornado, we were sitting around the table, and the subject came up again. Remember, we had been teasing him about this for 20 years.

&gt;You want to know why I was taking a shower? I'll tell you why. You don't remember this, because the tornado happened and everyone forgot everything else. This kid, Bob Soandso, was running late on the way to his wedding, and he got hit by a semi at the corner of XXX and highway#. He didn't make it. I was taking a shower because I was covered in fuel and this kid's blood. I knew the water could be shut off after the tornado, and if I didn't get that off, I would be stuck with that smell in my hair and on my skin. That's why I took a shower in the middle of a tornado. And I was watching it in my towel because I was washing a bit, running up to see how much time I had, and running back to the shower to rinse. 

All of a sudden, we realized what a bunch of assholes we'd been for 20 years. We never teased him a bit about that again. He hadn't even told my mom, because things were crazy immediately, due to my great-grandpa being severely injured, and two family members losing houses, and the whole town being a disaster zone. My dad never talked much about the bad stuff he saw as a volunteer fireman, or a tow-truck driver when we were growing up. He wasn't one to brag, just do the job, do it well, and move on. As he gets older, he's been sharing more details. It's fascinating, and heartbreaking to know what he's been through, and that he carried all of this alone for so long.

He's gone into burning houses to find friends (failed, because the guy had gone crazy, and was in town burning down his bar, too), fell through the floor of the funeral home when it burned, and was only saved by his air pack and instinctively sticking his elbows out catch himself (he made his fellow firefighters swear to never tell my mom about that one, so of course they told everyone at his retirement party). He's seen what happens to idiots who drink and drive, or ride motorcycles without helmets or protective gear. And since he knows pretty much everyone due to his job(s), many times he's known the victims. The worst was when my sister's best friend's mom decided to drive herself and her two young sons off a bridge that had been closed for construction, because she didn't want her soon-to-be ex-husband getting custody. My dad never got over that one, because they weren't found until the next morning, and my sister's friend died of exposure, not the crash (he unbuckled his seat belt, and died with his head in his mother's lap. That bitch died instantly, killing his brother, and he still wanted her comfort.) He was still warm when they got there. My dad wanted to tell my sister personally, so he went to the school and pulled her out of class after briefly telling the office staff what happened.

My dad is full of WTF moments where he shielded us from the WTF of his jobs. I'm sure I'll hear more as the years go by. I'm not sure I want to know all of what he's done, but damn, that guy is one tough S.O.B."
8436,"Negative. The margins are better than most retail items, since we only have about a week long window to sell our wares and have to be able to account for bad years, but nowhere near 40x. The big packs typically have a margin of about 1.5-2x.

The big packs actually are the smallest margin items we have, by percentage, and, subsequently, the best deal (by quantity) for the consumer. Most of the high margin items are the small, piecemeal items that every one needs to get for the kids in addition to the big items or big packs. Basically just like electronic stores don't really make money on the TV's and computers, but kill on the cables, cases, etc.

Don't get me wrong- it *may* be made for less than $5.. *in China*. But by the time you pay the shipping (by boat only), the tariff's, the haz-mat fees, the regulatory fees, and the yo mama fees, it's nowhere near that initial manufacturing cost.

&gt;person: um.. like ten?

&gt;One-upper: Ohh. probably couldn't be a showdog like *mine* then. That's too bad.

But sometimes I think Reddit mistakes this for one-upping:

&gt;Person: I've been teaching my dog a few new tricks lately.

&gt;Person 2: Yeah? Same here! My dog knows about 50. How many has yours got done?

&gt;Person: Um.. ten...

&gt;Person 2: That's not bad. He'll get there! Just keep at it, you know?

&gt;Person: [goes on reddit] ran into a fucking one-upper again today. They're the worst. [gets 2000 upvotes]

**Edit:** Lots of people replying to this saying, ""Well person 2 should have asked more questions!!! THAT IS ONE-UPPING!!!!!!"" 

I provided the example because they mentioned their dog knowing 50 tricks. This isn't one-upping, how could they have been one-upping before they ever even knew Person 1's dog only knew 10 tricks? For all they knew, Person 1's dog could have known 200 tricks.

And then when they learned Person 1's dog only knew 10 tricks, they didn't say anything condescending. They said something encouraging and cool.

Every so often, a predator would come in the yard and all the cats would vanish into trees and wait for it to leave. Except Autumn. Autumn didn't give a FUCK. She would sit on a low tree branch (maybe 6ft high) near where we fed them all. If/when the animal would show up near the food, she'd drop down and start attacking them.

Normally the surprise attack would scare off animals. She'd done it to possums, raccoons, numerous hunting dogs, a few loner coyotes, and at least one fox. The fox must've been desperate for food or something because it stayed to fight instead of running.

Nobody witnessed the whole fight, but my dad finished it with a rifle. The fox had been *seriously* scratched up by Autumn, who was just a standard sized cat; maybe 12 lbs max.

My dad described it as Autumn on the back of the Fox's head/ neck, holding on hit front feet scraped into the fox's cheeks. All which doing that insane scratch thing with her back feet that cats do. Eventually the fox shook her off, she ran back up the tree and my dad shot the fox.

After talking to their lawyers, we hammer out a £1m-plus-5% agreement to include £200,000 worth of their fastest chartered long-range business jet to leave in an hour, plus quick-stop crash-priority refueling along the way, plus some really nice snacks and entertainment, all to be paid from the challenge winnings.

In the meantime, I've taken the tube to the airport. The jet leaves as soon as the agreements are signed, headed for New Zealand. By the time the challenge ends, we are approximately 10-11,000 miles from Kings Cross Station measured on a great circle. I collect the approximately £100m+ and pay the charter jet company 5% plus an additional million pounds.

I am left with approximately £94-104m after expenses. As an Australian citizen, it is also possible I will not need to pay tax on this amount as the challenge was (presumably) not run by a financial institution I have an account with and I am not a regular contestant on game shows. However, it is also not a prize in a game of pure luck (as in lottery etc), so it is not specifically exempt. I would need to consult a local tax expert.

Therefore, depending on tax law, it is quite possible that after all is said and done, I would walk away with around **one hundred million pounds** free and clear after taxes and costs.

She then goes camping with some mates a few weeks later and has a drunken one night stand to some random guy around my age, taking her virginity.

- States have more control

- Annual testing is still required, but 95% of students must participate.

- Must ""disaggregate data based on students’ race, income, and disability status"" (basically states that the grade results are categorized)

- Can use other factors on top of scores to assess performance, and

- Details on how testing is performed and results are interpreted are left up to the states.

- $250 million in annual funding to early-childhood education
More money towards proven strategies that actually help kids learn

From www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/The_Every_Child_Achieves_Act_of_2015--summary.pdf :

- Grades 3-8 will require two tests, reading and math, per year, but once per year in high school

- science tests given three times between grades 3 and 12 (should be every year, IMO)

- Grants for low performing schools identified by the state

- More funding for professional development and teachers (not likely to see any increase in salary)
- States are NOT required to develop and implement teacher evaluation systems, but they are given the option

- Requirements of the school districts to measure English language proficiency

[David Hursh \(2007a\)](http://www.personal.kent.edu/~rcraig2/65012/Articles/Mccarthey_WC_2008.pdf) links the passage of NCLB to larger sociopolitical
changes from social democratic policies prevalent during the Roosevelt era
to neoliberal policies that promote standardized testing, greater accountability,
competition, school choice, and privatization of schools. These policies
share the assumption that such reforms are necessary in a globalized
economy to increase achievement. Using data from New York and Texas,
Hursh (2007b) argues that NCLB has increased the high school drop-out
rate and has failed to close the achievement gap or increase the rigor of curriculum.

Educators have pointed out the false assumptions and conflicts of
interest between government and business in the implementation of NCLB,
especially in relation to Reading First (Allen et al., 2007; Krashen, 2006;
Office of the Inspector General, 2006). 

Surveys and polls by several professional
organizations have found that teachers support the basic premises
of the law; however, criticisms of the law include the following: 

(a) results
from a statewide high-stakes test are poor measures of school performance,

(b) teaching to the test is widespread and detrimental, 

(c) growth models
that track students over the course of a year are better indicators than percentages
of students who passed mandated tests, 

(d) emphasis on reading
and math to judge school performance has led to less emphasis on other
subject matters, 

(e) reporting disaggregated test scores does not help
improve schools, 

(f) NCLB has resulted in lowering teacher retention
and motivation (“Mixed Reactions to NCLB,” 2005).

Darling-Hammond (2007) identified several unintended consequences of
NCLB including the finding that schools serving large numbers of students
of color and students with the greatest needs end up with the least qualified
teachers and untrained aides. She argues that the goal of 100% of students
achieving proficiency levels by 2014 is impossible because the steepness of
the standard is not only unrealistic but also norm-referenced tests, which
have been increasingly adopted by states, define 50% of students as below
the cut-off score by definition. 

**TL;DR:** No Child Left Behind does in fact leave behind many students in schools with limited resources. It puts pressure on teachers to teach strictly for the test as there are more benefits to teachers that yield higher test scores. The goals and expectations  that were set were too generous and basically impossible to meet.

8681,"Even more generally, you can derive this solely by considering the definition of exponentiation. The two essential properties of the exponential function are e^(a) * e^(b) = e^(a+b) and (e^(a))^b = e^(ab). When extending to the complex numbers, we want to make sure that e^(z) satisfies these two relations and matches the usual definition when z is real. 

From this, you can show that the only definition that fits is e^(a+i*b) = A*e^(a)*{cos(b)+i*sin(b)}, where A is a constant 1+iB, with B an arbitrary real number. We then choose B=0, and obtain Euler's Relation. No complex plane necessary.

Edit: This also demonstrates that Euler's Identity is ultimately arbitrary, as the value e^(i*pi) is dependent on our choice of B. It only equals -1 when B=0, and we could make it equal any value we want on the unit circle just by changing our choice of B."

To them it's probably  some random student that they never interact with and would not bother to look in to. What I'm saying is that there's a good chance they would've seen Peter Pettigrew on the map, but didn't know enough about him for it to be of any concern.

She would sometimes try trading one of her gross rawhide chews for something we were holding if she wanted it--she once dropped her toy in my dad's lap, nudged it towards him, and started ""speaking"" (not like a bark, more like dog complaining) while nodding at the apple he held.

She would also distract our book smart but not street smart other golden if she wanted the toy the other dog had. She'd take a random toy, go up to one of us and make a big deal, jumping and barking and playing with us with the toy. Then when book smart dog dropped her toy and ran to see what all the fuss was about, Emma would immediately leave us and grab book smart's toy and run off with it.

One time she found a hurt dove and brought it to us in her mouth, holding it so gently. 

I miss her so much! Her favorite food was buttered bagels, and every Sunday when we got fresh bagels, she'd stand in the kitchen next to them and complain at us until we gave her some, with butter."

I'finished my EE degree and in less than a year I've paid more in income tax that any benefits I received.

8891,"Nope, Daveed Diggs' Jefferson is pretty damn accurate! That whole musical has extreme attention to detail; I'd recommend checking out the Genius pages on it. It's super cool to see how many subtle references there are in pretty much every single line. 

The only thing that wasn't as prominent in the musical as it was in real life was Hamilton's bisexuality/relationship with John Laurens — which is sad because irl Hamilton was a flirty, cheeky little fucker in their correspondence. However, the relationship *was* alluded to at least a bit, with the ""Laurens, I like you a lot!"" (My Shot) and ""I have soldiers that will yield for you"" (Guns and Ships) lines. There were also some double entendres that potentially referenced his bisexuality in Cabinet Battle #2, but they were more Jefferson mockingly implying that Hamilton was Washington's boy toy — ""You're nothing without Washington behind you"" and ""Daddy's calling!"" The second one is also a reference to the real-life conspiracy at the time that Washington's affection for Hamilton was because Ham was actually his illegitimate son. 

That musical has so many layers, man. Lin Manuel Miranda is a genius.

The cop literally stood over the body and started scolding the crowd saying ""this is why you use helmets"" when I got the urge to check his pulse. The cop was confused but I immediately yelled ""HES STILL ALIVE! We need to get him to the hospital!"" Suddenly a group of guys start to pick him up when I yell to stop so I could grab his head/neck. I'm getting blood and matter all over me. We lift him and put him in the back of the officers truck. The cop is visibly uncomfortable gets on the radio and says the ambulance is on its way and to take him down. So we do. We waited for what felt like an eternity. I said fuck it we have to go or he'll die. So we put him back in the truck when the paramedics arrive. They do a once over, say he's still alive, place a board under him and took over.  

I walked back to the house covered in blood looking like a murder victim. My mom was confused then pissed off while crying the whole time. I washed up. An hour later a dude came up to me and shook my hand. It was his brother. He thanked me for giving his brother a chance but that he died just as they pulled into the hospital. It fucked me up to see it but also pissed me off that I wasn't harsher on the cop to just drive. Maybe we could have saved him. Probably not. I'll never forget it.

He is not unhappy (that we know of) and he has a respectable career that is going well. He is not a sociopath or anything. Of that I am certain. He does have a sense of humour and sense of empathy which I've witnessed in our childhood and the occasional Xmas gathering when he will have more than two beers and open up slightly.

I had recently moved out of a house pretty deep in suburbia to an apartment in SF. That mourning I woke up and proceeded with my routine of showering, dressing, and making some coffee. Then, in the infinite wisdom of autopilot I proceeded to drive a ~30 minute drive out of the city (where I work) to my old house, all while thinking how glad I am to be finished with work for the day. Never once did something seem out of place during the entire ride.
Then, upon arriving to my old home one might think that I would come to my senses. If one did think that, however, one would be wrong for apparently I have no senses.
Instead, when I arrived at a house that was no longer mine I walked in through the unlocked front door, poured out my coffee in the sink, walked past brand new furniture and got in the shower.
The point when I realized I had made a mistake? The smell of the shampoo was off. The moment when I realized ""this is not my shampoo"" was akin to being hit by the world's biggest train of ""oh fuck""
It was like I had sleep walked through my entire day and how just woken up naked and wet in someone else's house, not at work and without coffee.

Once Phil overcomes his fears, doubts, insecurities and starts being the person he likes and loving himself then he grabs the attention of Rita.  So, if you are living in fear in a Groundhog Day type scenario then you can guarantee the next day will start over.  

This is just a theory of mine.  I honestly believe Groundhog Day is a grossly underrated movie.  

Another movie that kind of follows this theme is Stranger than Fiction with Will Ferrell.  Love that movie too.

9052,"I've been in charge of interviews and hiring on several occasions, and for a few different industries. Throughout all of it, I've had the chance to read some truly terrible résumés. Obviously, my standards won't be universal, but there are several things that will instantly get an application thrown in the trash.

------

1. **Obvious lies or exaggerations.**    
You'd be absolutely astounded by the number of people who think they can hoodwink their way into a job. It's almost as if they assume that hiring managers don't know anything about their own industries, or that applications just need to include the right keywords. Unfortunately for those job-seekers, it's pretty damned easy to spot when someone is just throwing sentences together, and it's even more evident when someone has invented accomplishments in order to seem more impressive.

2. **Typos or misspellings of any kind.**    
Proofreading is neither difficult nor time-consuming, particularly when spellcheckers and online grammar references are so ubiquitous. A person who can't be bothered to spend thirty seconds ensuring that their application is error-free comes across as being either stupid or lazy, and very few employers look on those traits as assets.

3. **Idiocy or offensiveness on social media.**    
It may come across as sneaky or distasteful, but life in the Internet Age comes with the expectation that employers will comb through your online profiles before they make a hiring decision. If someone writes poorly, acts in an offensive way, or gives the impression that they'd be a less-than-stellar employee, chances are that someone else will receive an offer before they do.

4. **The applicant is a bear.**    
Threats of mauling don't help the hiring process.

5. **An obvious form letter.**    
As efficient as it might seem to have cover letter template, applications offered without a personalized introduction tend to get moved to the bottom of the pile. Much like the lies or exaggerations offered in the first point, form letters are incredibly easy to recognize, and they give the impression that a given applicant is more interested in getting hired than actually doing the job.

6. **Multiple applications to the same company.**    
Most employers prefer to find the right person for the right position. While there are rare exceptions to this rule, an individual who applies to every role for which they're qualified will seem less interested in *those* jobs, and more intent on landing *any* job. Keep in mind, hiring managers aren't concerned with applicants' desire for money; they're focused on what a potential employee can contribute.

------

In short, when applying for a job, people would do well to remember that they aren't just submitting a single document for consideration. Their entire work history, their abilities, and even their personality will be taken into account, and all of those things need to be put on displayed in a person's résumé.

**TL;DR: Red flags include dishonesty, illiteracy, laziness, and four-inch-long claws.**"

I asked my friend what it was and he said ""I don't know how to explain it but it's part of the inside of the pig...you should try it.""  

My response was ""sure! I'll try anything...besides, it's deep fried, how bad can it be?""

I tossed one of those fuckers into my mouth and started chewing.  For about 3 seconds it tasted fine until this blast of what smelled like shit - yes literally shit, overwhelmed my sense of taste and smell.  I kept grinding away and and swallowed and grabbed a glass of water to help relieve the taste but the stench of feces was still in my mouth for the rest of the evening...no matter what I ate.  I found out later that the dish was deep fried pig intestines and sometimes you get pieces that basically go all the way to the exit point and as a bonus sometimes pieces ""aren't as clean as they should be"".

Once me and my friend get to our other friend's place (the one that moved away), we find out her mum isn't joining us tonight, and that it's just us three 13-year old girls and her creepy step-dad. He asked us if we wanted drugs, brought back pot for our friend to smoke, and gave us all beer and coolers. He was friends with the neighbor next door and went to visit him for a while, but I was freaked out. I didn't know why the mum didn't come to the sleepover too or why my friend's dad kept giving us alcohol. I didn't drink that night nor did I sleep. I remember asking my friends the silliest questions to make them laugh and keep them awake with me so they didn't fall asleep, and being really careful around her step-dad, who always seemed to give his step-daughter hugs or tickle her when he returned.

I remember I called my dad at like 4 in the morning to pick me up. I couldn't deal with it, I felt so uncomfortable and had an awful stomach ache from stressing out. Something wasn't right. Without hesitation, he picked me up and we went back home.

I found out years later that my friend was repeatedly molested and sexually abused by her step-dad, step-brother, and other men in her life. I feel terrible looking back on it now, how I didn't see the signs. I remember telling my parents that her mum hadn't shown up, and they were upset too. But I feel so bad for my friend.

9249,"Back when I was living in my first apartment, I thought it would be a good idea to get myself some silk sheets. The intention was to create an environment of classy sensuality for any young women who might spend the night at my house (without having to drop a fortune on things like champagne and chocolate-dipped strawberries). As I discovered, though, silk sheets are damned expensive... and given that I was a broke college student, I couldn't exactly afford the top-quality bed-coverings.

Thus, I made the mistake of purchasing *cheap* silk bed sheets.

Anyone who has spent any time wrapped in low-quality silk knows how incredibly unpleasant an experience it can be: You start off feeling like the sheets *should* be soft and smooth, but there's this annoying tickle that dances across your entire body. Rolling into different positions is a crap-shoot between sliding around between slippery folds and dragging them along with you. You start to sweat, and the material actually sticks to you a little bit, making your bed less of relaxing cocoon and more of a sweltering burrito.

There was one other issue, as well... but I didn't discover it until I actually followed through on my plan of having a young woman sleep over.

After a particularly active (and unwisely long) session together, the girl and I passed out next to each other with nothing but those silk sheets between us and the hot night air. I got up once during the night, relieved myself in the bathroom, and went back to bed, which woke my partner from the depths of her own slumber. She apparently decided to emulate my actions... only instead of quietly returning from the restroom, she rushed in and shook me awake, demanding to know if I had any sexually transmitted diseases.

Now, I've always been careful about staying clean (and we'd discussed as much), so the accusations were more than a little bit jarring. When I asked what had prompted them, the young woman turned on the light and displayed her naked form to me... and I saw that much of her body had been dyed a light shade of blotchy purple.

A brief examination revealed that my own skin had adopted an oddly violet tint, too.

We eventually figured out that my cheap-as-hell, knockoff silk bed sheets had bled during the night, transferring their color to my paramour and me. Worse still, the stuff didn't wash off as easily as I would have liked, and the two of us spent more than a little time in the shower together. It *could have* been an enjoyable evening, but mutual bathing just isn't as much fun when the intention is actually to get clean.

I also had to change my bed sheets before we could finally pass out again.

**TL;DR: I made a mistake with my bed and a girl dyed because of it.**"

9358,"I wrote my mom a letter and drove into town just to read it to her a few days after my college graduation. I was ready to tell them a few months before that, but they had done so much to support me during my education that I didn't want anything to spoil that day for them. I started sobbing while reading it to her and she grabbed my hand and told me it was ok. She had to finish reading it herself while I just sat there and cried. She told me she loved me no matter what. I left shortly after to give her time to process. I asked her to give the note to my dad. I was too much of a coward to say it to his face and regret this. He refused to read the letter.

The Good -- They have never treated me any differently. Ever. I wouldn't even be able to tell that my dad knew if my mom hadn't told me that he did. He doesn't agree with it, but he is still the same wonderful dad to me AND he is always friendly, kind, and giving (birthday gifts, christmas gifts, takes us to dinner, etc) to my girlfriend. That means so much to me. My mom is vocal about gay rights and goes to P-FLAG meetings once a month (Parents, Families, and Friends of Lesbians and Gays). She knows this is not a choice. She thinks all love is right and beautiful and just wants everyone in the world to have happiness. She has distanced herself from certain friends (we live in the deep south, haha) after they have said negative things about homosexuality in casual conversation...(I don't want her to do this, everyone is entitled to their own opinion), but it does make me feel good that she's in my corner. 

The Bad -- my dad can not verbally acknowledge that I am gay or that I have a girlfriend. He accepts it (according to my mom), but it bothers me that he can't even discuss it or say it out loud. My brother is also gay (out for awhile).. so my parents have two gay children (they also have straight children, haha). My mom occasionally complains that she can't share our lives with her conservative friends, that my wedding won't be what she always pictured, blah blah blah. She will also say things like ""I hope you don't ever cut your hair short or stop wearing dresses."" I don't appreciate comments like that -- but all in all, they have been super cool. I feel very loved by them. "

9413,"Sorry if this gets a little long, I'm a rambly person. 

Basically, last year, my best friend and I headed to America for a convention in New Jersey, and spent a while in Manhattan in the lead-up because shit's expensive and no way were we flying seventeen hours for three days in back-ass New Jersey alone. 

While in Times Square, we discovered that people wear fictional character suits and take photos with tourists for money. Which I get. Like, kudos to them for making an honest living and spending all day in a hot suit. 

However, they tended to be pretty damn insistent and often grabbed at/followed you to try pull you into a hug, even if you'd declined. Being an extremely anxious person who has trouble saying no *without* being followed, this was rather terrifying for me. I ended up developing an (admittedly irrational, but what can ya do) knee-jerk panic reaction when I saw these guys because of it. 

Anyway, something that's relevant to know about Best Friend is that she has a habit of walking very confidently in the absolutely wrong direction. I also suffer from chronic fatigue while she's super fit, so sometimes I'd lag behind her. This was usually not an issue. 

Until one night, when we were heading back to our hotel. Times Square is obviously always pretty busy at night, but this night was particularly packed with people. Thanks a combination of the previously-mentioned issues, I ended up losing Best Friend in the crowd. I was in the process of searching for her, when I saw *them,* and *they* saw me.

Seven or eight minions were swarming towards me from all directions, hands outstretched. It was like something out of a fucking horror movie, I swear to god: frozen smiles, dead eyes, glowing eerily in the rapidly-flashing lights of Times Square. My usual panic reaction kicked in, now bolstered by my somewhat out-of-it state due to to very little sleep the night before, the heat of the evening, and the heavy-duty pain medication I'd taken earlier. The gist is that, in the moment, I forgot there were people inside those suits and my thought process amounted to, ""Holy shit, I'm going to be killed by fucking minions."" 

I stood there frozen for a moment, enough time for the minion mafia to surround me like a fucking cult on the verge of breaking out the *join us join us join us* chant. Then the leader of the pack, a six-foot-something [Kevin](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/ideas/images/4/4a/Kevinminion.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150715191940), grabbed me by the arm and pulled me to its yellow, sewer-smelling breast and held me there tightly. 

In the midst of *freaking the fuck out,* I managed to regain my wits enough to blabber something probably-incoherent along the lines of ""NOTHANKYOUBUTIHOPEYOUHAVEALOVELYEVENINGGOODBYE,"" broke free of Kevin's death grip, and bolted in a random direction. 

The random direction happened to be straight into the road as the light turned green. For the second time that evening, I looked death in the face as the traffic started rolling toward me. (Technically, it was the first *actual* time I'd looked death in the face that evening, but I maintain that the minions were more traumatic.)

I managed to narrowly avoid being flattened by a fucking double-decker tourbus and get onto the other side of the road, only to find Best Friend obliviously carrying out an amiable chat with some stranger she'd met while I was being forcefully indoctrinated into the Satanic Church of the Minions. 

God, and I thought I'd hated those little shits before.

TL;DR: Fuck minions. Also, I might get my best friend a leash.

ETA: Wow, gilded for the very first time! Thank you, kind stranger! "

Trees can survive forest fires, tsunamis, magnitude 9 earthquakes.

They've used chemical signals in the form of nutrients to form symbiotic relationships with bacteria, viruses, fungi and every single animal on the planet. They provide damn near every lick of oxygen we breath. We are under the impression that animals rose to prominence in this world and took over,not a chance in hell. Animals didn't evolve, plants subtly guided the evolution of organisms that could reconvert the oxygen they'd toxified the earth with, then further guided the evolution of animals to eat fruits they specifically designed to be delicious to them so that they would disperse their offspring in the form of seeds in dung MADE OUT OF PLANTS that serves as the perfect fertilizer for it. 

All without the function that we call ""intelligence"". 

Nah, you don't fuck with plants. You think the Happening was some shitty movie with shitty Zooey Deschanel in it? Nah that shit's a documentary sent back in time. 

The trees know what's up. And we don't stand a chance against the tide of time like plants do. We could drop every nuke we have, send out every super plague we have, use every chemical weapon we have. That won't even touch the grip they have on this planet.

9498,"Hahaha this is my kind of question since I use to be a wedding photographer.

* I had to take pictures for this one couple and let me tell you, they were pretty opposites. The groom was just the nicest guy around and the bride was of course a Bridezilla. Now the groom maybe weighed 125 lbs soaking wet and the bride was a good 400 lbs. We did all of their pictures and even extra ones they did not ask for. Well the one the bride wanted the most was one with her sitting on his lap, all I could think of is his legs breaking under the weight but he held onto his smile for a few pictures, well until the chair broke. He limped up the isle and the bride blamed us for the chair breaking and him getting hurt. I don't think the church was happy with her.

* With wedding pictures some brides want the ""getting ready for the big day"" package where that is us following them around getting hair shots, dressing room before and after shots, and quite a few others. Well we finished getting the pictures of her hair and they were about to get on the dress over her head and we head out. You know, 2 guys don't want to be in there when lady's are changing. After she got on the dress they wanted us back in to take more pics and out of no where the brides's mother comes out of a separate corner in nothing but her undergarments and no bra. Let me say that the bride was in her mid 30's and the mother was in her 50's. I did not know skin could have that many flaps.

* In small towns the churches rarely have AC and it was a good 90°F that day so it was maybe 100°F in the church. Halfway through the vows the groom just flat board falls from fainting. Now that hurts and all but he smashed his teeth / whole face on the stairs on the way down. 1 chipped tooth and a broken nose later he is married."

9501,"Was wondering if tanning had been around as far back as 5000 BC, [turns out it has](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanning#History):

&gt; In ancient history, tanning was considered a noxious or ""odoriferous trade"" and relegated to the outskirts of town, amongst the poor. Indeed, tanning by ancient methods is so foul smelling, tanneries are still isolated from those towns today where the old methods are used. Ancient civilizations used leather for waterskins, bags, harnesses and tack, boats, armour, quivers, scabbards, boots, and sandals. Tanning was being carried out by the South Asian inhabitants of Mehrgarh between 7000 and 3300 BC.[2] Around 2500 BC, the Sumerians began using leather, affixed by copper studs, on chariot wheels.

&gt;Skins typically arrived at the tannery dried stiff and dirty with soil and gore. First, the ancient tanners would soak the skins in water to clean and soften them. Then they would pound and scour the skin to remove any remaining flesh and fat. Next, the tanner needed to remove the hair from the skin. This was done by either soaking the skin in urine[citation needed], painting it with an alkaline lime mixture, or simply allowing the skin to putrefy for several months then dipping it in a salt solution. After the hairs were loosened, the tanners scraped them off with a knife.

&gt;Once the hair was removed, the tanners would ""bate"" (soften) the material by pounding dung into the skin, or soaking the skin in a solution of animal brains. Bating was a fermentative process which relied on enzymes produced by bacteria found in the dung. Among the kinds of dung commonly used were those of dogs or pigeons.[3] Sometimes, the dung was mixed with water in a large vat, and the prepared skins were kneaded in the dung water until they became supple from bacterial enzyme action, but not too soft. The ancient tanner might use his bare feet to knead the skins in the dung water, and the kneading could last two or three hours.

&gt;This combination of urine, animal feces, and decaying flesh made ancient tanneries malodorous.

 
So... How in the hell did they manage to come up with that process in the first place?"

9508,"Funny thing about chores and work. When you do the same chores all the time you eventually forget that those other chores, the ones your SO is doing, even exist. You can become very bitter very quickly when you're mowing the lawn all the time and your SO never does. Dishes never enter your mind. You know they exist, you know they get clean, but because you don't do them your brain sort of blanks on them.

I think it's the same reason why working/stay-at-home spouses get resentful. All the Home partner sees is a tired person come home and ""slack off"". All the working partner sees is a person who gets to stay home all day. Each of them appreciates that what *they're* doing is work, but cannot fully grasp that their partner is working hard as well. 

And then when the home partner returns to the workforce they are often stunned by the fact that it really is work. 

This was a problem I was having in my own marriage. On some level my wife understood I worked a physical job, but she still stopped short of respecting it the same way she respected her own work. My solution was to get her to come to work with me. 

See, I own a small company. It's pretty much just me. Roofs, minor renovations, concrete pads, that sort of thing. I'll never forget how on the ride home at the end of the job (three 18 hour days, which was not abnormal for what I was doing) she told me she'd had no idea. It changed the way she looked at me. 

We need to re-up that once in a while, otherwise she forgets. Me? I do my best to remember that this cognitive dissonance exists. I find that being aware it exists helps me to stay ahead of it.

I carried it all night with me figuring I'd find the girl eventually when I got a call at like 2 am when I was going to bed. I answered and said ""hey, I found your friends phone, have her call me!"" It was the girl, and she  immediately began accusing me of stealing her stuff and asking why I didn't turn it in at the frat. Ummm... Because I knew I'd actually return it. I refused to let her pick it up because she was being a wicked bitch and it was 2 am, and gave it back the next day with all of the cash, gift cards, everything. I did write a note telling her not to be such a cunt to the people who find her stuff and return it to her. Fuck, I was so happy I found it and could help her out and she was so rude. She ended up getting me banned from the frat (lol, like I gave a fuck). Still pissed about it to this day. "

One thing you'll notice if you see a lot of dwellings is that kitchens, like bathrooms, virtually never have carpet. This is because of all the little spills that tend to happen in those locations, any carpet or rug will quickly end up smelly and disgusting.

Even if OP gets them a nice rug and convinces them to use it, it's probably not going to be used above the kitchen."

We were bored one day about 2 months ago, so we decided to do a blind taste test to see if I could correctly identify the following: Coke, Diet Coke, Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, orange soda, Diet Dr. Pepper and Sprite Zero (an odd bunch but wanted it to be challenging). They could be presented in any order, and could not be smelled as to try to help identify them. As it turns out I got 50% of them correct. I don't remember exactly which ones I got right or wrong, however, I do remember that I mistakenly guessed Sprite Zero for orange soda, and most shockingly, Diet Pepsi for Diet Coke. (Granted I had not yet tried the Diet Coke and when I got to it I immediately changed my guesses) but for a moment, I thought Diet Pepsi was my beloved Diet Coke...

Within the past week I've seen online profiles for the following:

1. A 29 year old woman 7 months pregnant. Don't worry though, the father wants nothing to do with her so there is no baby-daddy drama. Also she says she's definitely not looking for a new father for her unborn baby, so it must be true.

2. A 24 year old woman with 4 children. I'm willing to bet she never rushes into anything head first without assessing the situation.

3. A 30 year old ""full time stay at home mom"". Well, thanks for telling me you have no plans on getting a job anytime soon, and probably have never had one. How does she support herself right now I wonder?

4. A 31 year old woman where every single picture in her profile is her posing with a nibbling, but says she's not looking for anything serious. By the way her hobbies are ""nurturing, shopping for baby clothes, romantic dinners, and snuggling""

5. 21 year old girls who tells you her age in the profile but set their search age much higher so they show up in the searches of people who aren't interested in 21 year old girls. She is ""very mature for her age"" and definitely isn't sorting out any daddy issues.

6. The opposite. 46 year old women who set their age as 31 because they are young at heart.

But please remember for every bit of 31 year young Cindy on the dating sites, there is 38 year old carless Bobby No-Job who hasn't seen his dick since W was in office, and probably hasn't cleaned it since either. Be better than Bobby and you can do better than Cindy."

The more functionnalities they add, the shittier the site becomes.

It's actually a problem most companies have when they have their hands on a great product. The product is nice, and doesn't require any extensive changes or extensive maintenance but the team in charge, they feel like there must be a way to make it better.

9713,"It would have to be my mother's vegetarian re-imagining of lasagna. She had gotten the bright idea somewhere to replace the noodles with eggplant slices, remove the tomato sauce completely, and change the traditionally used cheeses to ""healthier"" alternatives of cheese (e.g. using cottage cheese).

Had it been served as a dish under its own name, like some kind of ""eggplant casserole"" perhaps, it would have simply been horrid. But to a child that was promised one of their favorite foods and received a watery lump of white/green mush it was far and away the worst possible meal someone could come up with. 

Edit: Since I'm getting a lot of replies about this let me be clear: the swapping of the eggplant for noodles was incidental to the going vegetarian part. Yes, my mother is aware cheese is made from animal products. No, my mother does not think tomatoes or noodles are animals. No, adding dairy does not disqualify something from being vegetarian. Thank you to those concerned enough to check that my mother isn't an idiot. And stop telling me about frying eggplants and adding it to lasagna. I get it, it's delicious. "

Quite a few of them continued to hook me up with free books after I finished their class.

The Triple Alliance (colloquially known as the Aztecs) was a confederation of three city-states, Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan, that formed in 1428. It rapidly expanded and coalesced as an empire with Tenochtitlan becoming the hegemonic power within the alliance. In 1521 it was dismantled by Cortés and his indigenous allies.

But it's just a comparison of dates that doesn't offer a lot of context. There were states and people living in the Valley of Mexico long before and long after the century when the Triple Alliance existed. It's like saying ""MIT predates Germany."" Yes, technically true, but also kind of misleading and pointless."

9776,"Here's a copy/paste of one of the comments on that video which breaks down the timeline:  

0:29 - Pyrotechnics go off and ignite the acoustic foam in the drummer's alcove. The foam is composed of urethane foam over polyethylene foam. Urethane foam is highly flammable and creates dark smoke along with carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide gas when lit; polyethylene foam is harder to ignite but in this case released additional heat once lit by the urethane foam.  
0:32 - Brian Butler, who was there filming a nightclub safety video, notices the flames and starts to make for the exit. Most people believe the fire to be part of the act.  
0:45 - The band realizes something is wrong and stops playing. The flames are quickly getting out of control and rapidly spreading across the stage.  
0:49 - Jack Russell, lead singer of Great White, comments, ""Wow...that's not good,"" into the microphone before exiting the stage and leaving the building through the platform exit door.  
0:58 - Fire alarms begin to go off. The Station did not have any sort of sprinkler system installed. People begin to make their way to the front entrance. A few people try to leave through the platform exit door, but are turned away by a bouncer who says it's for the band only.  
1:09 - The stage is completely engulfed in flames and people begin to panic.  
1:23 - Smoke begins to visibly pour into the hallway. A few seconds later a woman can be heard crying, ""Where's my husband?""  
1:29 - Butler makes it out of the Station, but continues filming. His quick action most likely saved his life.  
1:30-1:35 - The gas created by the burning urethane foam causes a flashover, which is the ignition of combustible material in an enclosed area. In the Station, this included the furniture, wall coverings, flooring, lights, and people.  
1:35 - People start screaming as they begin to burn and get trapped inside by the crush at the front door. Butler kicks in one of the windows in the sunroom located to the right of the front entrance.  
1:48 - A few people exit through the sunroom's broken window. In their panic, most people still try to exit the same way they went into the club earlier.  
1:59 - The stampede has caused a crush at the front door that completely blocks the exit.  
2:05 - People on the outside begin to smash the windows in the main bar to the left of the entrance in an effort to get people out. The metal railing in front of the entrance noticeably impedes people attempting to pull victims from the crush.  
2:23 - People in the main bar  jump out from the broken windows.  
4:04 - People inside continue to scream in fear and pain. Black smoke pours from the doorway and windows. Onlookers attempt to help, but there isn't much they can do.  
5:01 - Butler walks around to the platform exit door and calls out, ""Anybody inside?"" The door is covered in flames and inaccessible from the inside due to the stage fire.  
5:18 - The stage fire has ignited the roof of the Station.  
5:38 - Firefighters are now on the scene. People in the sunroom can be heard screaming and crying out for help.  
5:43 - A crying man tells firefighter, ""Those guys are on fire!"" The firefighter responds, ""I know, I know!"" Another man carrying someone over his shoulder cries for a medic.  
6:19 - A man stumbles from the front entrance on fire as firefighters set up a hose.  
6:39 - Firefighters begin to spray the Station with water. Trucks and ambulances continue to arrive offscreen.  
7:01 - A police officer asks one of the survivors what happened. You can hear him reply that ""there were fireworks all over the place.""  
7:13-7:49 - Butler puts the camera down. He may have been getting something from the car above it.  
7:54 - Butler approaches either a police officer or firefighter and begins to speak to them. ""You need a lotta trucks down here right now! There are multiple, multiple deaths in this thing, you gotta get people down here...I'm fine, I got out, was one of the first people to get out. I saw what had happened, I have it all on tape from inside! ...Multiple deaths, these people were trampled trying to get out of this place. There's all kinds of people stuck on top of one another in the front door trying to get out, and they're stacked on top of one another trying to get out, but they couldn't get out..."" An approaching firetruck drowns out the rest of his words.  
10:06 - Firefighters still arrive and desperately work to put out the flames. Butler speaks on the phone to somebody: ""The building is engulfed in flames, and there's like, there's gotta be 50 people still left inside that thing dead. This is not good...I'm out of there, I'm out, the fire department's here already, I mean what happened, happened...they all got stuck in the doorway...there was so many people, there was so many people burning...it's unbelievable what's going on here, and I got every inch of it on tape...I have to stay here now, I mean...I, I have to!""   
11:10 - A firefighter yells for anybody that's hurt and anybody who's hurt that can walk to move to one area in the parking lot.  
11:26 - A police officer tells everyone to stay 50 yards back and to not touch the front door.  
11:40 - Firefighters begin to get a grip on the flames, although much of the building continues to burn.  
12:18 - The fire has completely collapsed the roof of the Station.  

Once the fire was put out, firefighters found 31 bodies in the front entrance and hallway, 9 just outside the hallway, 18 in the sunroom, 1 on the dance floor, 3 in the main bar, 9 between the kitchen and the rear bar, 1 in the kitchen, 10 outside the walk-in cooler, 4 in the office, and 3 in the bathrooms. 11 more were discovered just outside the exit.﻿"

The worst is that she deleted it, realised and restored a new version. It took them three weeks to realise that no ones work was syncing to the drive. We lost three weeks worth of work. She actually tried to deny what she did, but everything is recorded somewhere and it took two Google techs coming out to work out what happened. She got fired for her adamant denial.

EDIT - Sorry I should say that it took them that long to realise that the things everyone was adding and changing to their own drive weren't syncing with the shared version of the drive. We use Netsuite as our main platform so lucky orders and a lot of scripting weren't lost.

One day I come to class and two girls hand me two new boxes of shoes, saying they bought them for me. One was a pair of dressy shoes with a buckle and the other was a pair of pink moccasins with rhinestones on the toe.  I was delighted but didn't think much of it, not even in the days afterward when some other kids starting calling me poor. (Funny because almost all of us lived in the same public housing high-rise and ""food stamp"" was a common phrase because you could buy snacks with them, so it just goes to show my family was the poorest of the poor.) I don't even know if anyone in my family noticed the shoes but I know my mother never asked me about them--then again she was always working or claimed to be working so I never saw her more than once a day.

Many, many years later I realized the teacher had bought those shoes and asked the other kids to pretend they had. Thank you Mrs. Benjamin."

On multiple choice tests, I'd make sure to sit in front of or behind someone who knew the answers, usually one of my best friends who just so happened to be the valedictorian.  (It was kind of ridiculous--this kid was one of three brothers, all in different years, who were all the valedictorians of their respective graduating classes)

If I was in front, I'd put my pencil down, feign stretching, and display the number of the question that I needed the answer to with my fingers over my shoulders. (Ex: 4 = 4 fingers, 14 = 1 on my left hand, 4 on my right, etc.)  My friend would then poke me in the back with his pen/pencil--one time for A, two for B, etc.

If I was in the back, I'd poke him in the back with my writing utensil an amount of times corresponding to the question.  If the question number was in the double digits, like 25 for example, I'd poke him twice, then ""draw"" a line to indicate moving onto the next digit, then poke him five more times.

Never got caught or even close to it.  The method was confined to my immediate circle of friends (roughly five of us) and it got us through plenty of inevitable failures.  Once I perfected it, I pretty much spent the rest of high school playing GBA ROMs on my laptop instead of paying attention."

10095,"In short, there are three kinds of color ""sensors"" in the eye, each can pick up a different wavelength. The brain takes the information from all three, jumbles it together and works out what color you are seeing. *certain kinds of* color blindness happen when one of the three ~~is under developed~~ *overlaps with and is overshadowed by another*, so the brain never realizes it's getting that information. The brain is getting a ton of information from the other two, but only a little from the third, so a color blind person can't ""see"" colors that are combinations requiring that third sensor. The glasses work by filtering out light ~~that the two fully developed sensors see~~ *from where there is overlap*, ~~so that they are on par with the third.~~ *to give the brain distinct signals.* The brain can figure out the rest.

edit: I posted this literally minutes after waking up and fucked up the explanation. A more accurate description is that two of the receptors (your ""red"" and ""green"" receptors) have more overlap than normal. This pretty much confuses things, one over powers the other. The solution is to filter out the light that is in the middle of that overlap. [Here](http://enchroma.com/technology/) is a link to their website where they explain how exactly it works."

My fiancés brother fought with my fiancé constantly over the past couple of years, for numerous reasons. We got engaged on December 13th, 2014, and didn't get married until May in 2016. He got engaged to his girlfriend on December 2015, and they decided to get married the weekend before our wedding. As a result, they had a very unplanned wedding that wasn't very good, no photographer, cake was made by a family member, most people didn't have matching colors, etc. When they were trying to party for their reception, everyone else was leaving to go home and pack for the trip to Florida. This obviously upset them and they made a huge scene. It was clear that they were trying to ""steal our thunder"" so to speak.

We asked him around November, prior to our wedding, if he was going to try to go and he said ""No. I don't have money for that."" Then he spent the next couple of months trying to talk everyone else out of going to our wedding.

Our wedding day comes up, and we find out one of my fiancés sisters talked her father into bringing her brother and his new wife as our wedding must be the best place to reconcile their differences. We never told them they weren't invited, but we planned a lot of our wedding around his split custody of his daughter because his daughter and my wife are very close (my wife practically raised his daughter from birth until age 6) and he refused to bring his daughter to FL. Our wedding, became their honeymoon. The day of the wedding, he isn't talking to us or anything, and is constantly trying to get everyone to leave the beach house and go play mini-golf or go and rent scooters to drive around on. He doesn't have any money, so he has to convince his father to want to do this stuff by getting all of the kids (ages 3-10) to go. An hour before the wedding while I'm looking for my son to get ready for the wedding, he is talking them into going and getting ice cream really quick and going on a walk. It was clear he was intentionally trying to sabotage the wedding. His wife (our new sister in law), for some reason, told all of her sisters she ""She heard [my wife] say make-up was going to be done at 1:00 when it was at 11:00, so at 10:40 my wife comes in ready to leave so that everyone could go get their make up done and nobody was ready to leave. When his wife was confronted about this, she started crying and saying she didn't understand why we were ""being mean to her.""

Wedding comes and goes, and now its picture time. Of course, we want them to be in pictures even though we aren't getting along with them. We are all wearing light colors, but them? Dark Blue and Dark Purple. 

We can't find the photographer, and finally the photographer comes over (she wasn't a cheap photographer either), and says ""Did you want so many pictures of that other couple?"" and points to them. The photographer says that they requested her come over (at our request) and take several pictures of them on the beach together because they were just married. They tried to steal our photographer, who now wanted more money.

Reception time, they decide they aren't going to be involved, for whatever reason. Now her brother has went to all of the kids and promised to take them to the arcade and ride go-karts and tries to get money from her Dad who said no, he was going to stay for the reception, which resulted in a bunch of pissed off kids who were just promised go karts and arcade games. So, the last hour of day time, the brother and his wife are going to go to the beach and play in the water. That's fine. Our reception was on the back patio of the beach house which overlooks the beach. They returns soaking wet, covered in sand, and they tromp through where everyone is dancing and gathering and now the bottoms of everyone dresses including the wedding dress, is now gross and wet. Now they decide they are cold, so they jump in the luke-warm hot tub spa thing on the deck. The cake is sitting next to the hot tub (which isn't on) and gets soaked within seconds of the jets of the hot tub being turned on and them splashing around. The younger kids are now going ape-shit to get in the pool too. The cake is ruined. About an hour later, the brother starts an argument with the sister that sneakily invited them to our wedding saying that ""If he knew it was going to be so boring down here, he wouldn't have came!"" and ""It's vacation, nobody wants to do anything!"" - it wasn't our vacation that day, it was our wedding, for half the day, and he couldn't Not be obnoxious for 4 or 5 hours long enough to let us just get married without him being the center of attention.

10128,"Shortly after (a few days) I started dating my wife she invited me over to her place for dinner. Pork roast, baked potatoes, green beans etc. Needless to say, I was looking forward to it for many reasons not the least of which was that I somehow was dating a beautiful woman who also apparently could cook.

I show up at the scheduled time after getting out of work and sit down to the table with a glass of JD while she whizzes around the kitchen wrapping things up. 

She come trotting out with our plates happy/proud as could be and serves dinner. I took one look and knew I was doomed (as I had worked in a few restaurants up to this point and grew up in a family of cooks) but figured I could man my way through it.

The beans and baked potato were fine. The pork roast, however, was not. It was like eating a hockey puck that had taken a trip through the pits of hell. I casually asked for the salt and ketchup claiming that I like my pork roast with those and went to town. 30 minutes later I had a gut full of leather and veggies and was thanking Zeus that I was able to get through it after kindly turning down seconds due to a 'late lunch at work'.

Fast forward a few months and we were having a grill out. I am assembling my burger and my girlfriend passes me the ketchup which i (without even thinking) decline because I do NOT like ketchup on anything. The table goes silent, a cold wind blows through the rair and it dawns on me... I just bucking blew my fucking cover.

Needless to say, the next few minutes were not pleasant. Fortunately for me her dad came to my rescue and said ""Darling, I saw the pork roast you made and I wouldn't have fed it to my dog let alone another person and this guy ate every bit you gave him. Either he was really desperate or he REALLY loves you so you need to keep that in mind before you rip him in half over the ketchup snafu"".

I handed her a pot, some pasta, pasta sauce, and whatnot. She held the pot in one hand, and with the other pantomimed putting the bag of pasta in the pot. She said ""So, the pasta just goes in here? And you cook it?""

I *literally* had to go downstairs with her and teach her to boil water.

I was totally NOT attracted to my now-husband when we first met. We met online eons ago, in the days of super low res webcams. So when we chatted with video, it looked like I was talking to a potato with a bad haircut. He sent on pictures. God, I love that man so much but for all of the years I have known him, he has taken maybe 2 dozen good pictures. It doesn't help that he kept going to the same lady to get a terrible haircut and that he has one of those facial structures where he always looks bored, high, drunk or a combination of the three. 

So before we had even met in person, I thought he looked like an angry potato with a widow's peak.

Then we finally met in person and thank god, he was gorgeous. Not throw your panties on the stage gorgeous, but he wasn't the bridge troll that his pictures led me to think he might have been. I still wasn't attracted to him for about 3 years past that though. Because of a significant age gap, I assumed we were only friends so never bothered looking at him as anything else beyond personality.

When he admitted his feelings for me though, it was like a switch flipped in my head and a few years of disinterest cleared up and suddenly I was (husband'sname)sexual. He was (and is all) I wanted.

10259,"I had a party once where ALL of the ladies were gals that I'd dated at one point, and all of whom I'd met online.  Every. last. one..  

It took my walking out of the room, and about two minutes for someone to ask the newest girl: ""So, how do you know u/always_cavok""  

It happened in slow motion as I was walking back in.  The realization what that question meant, the fact that I'd befriended all of them after we dated, that none of them really knew the story with the others, and finally, that the bulk of my female friends are girls that I've met online. Eff! 

Sadly, did not turn in to a Penthouse-letter worthy orgy. 

10/10, would not do again. 

[edit: words]

[edit2: more detail]

For those of you asking, I managed to diffuse the situation with honesty.  I put a stop to the question as I walked back in to the room, and then owned up to the fact that all of the gals there I'd met online.   We all had a good laugh, and then ate some good food.   

Years ago, I learned a lesson from a Hugh Grant interview that has served me really well.  For those of you who don't know, he got caught with a prostitute, fined and sent to an aids education program.  He seriously fucked up, hollywood was abuzz with scandal talk, the usual shit that happens to high-profile people.  He then [went on the tonight show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrJ2jc6qfzA) to answer the question everyone was asking.   

Now, there's never going to be a chance where I end up with a prostitute, and even less of a chance that anyone would care enough to report it in a paper, but he owned his shit, and his response served him well. The 'scandal' died right after this interview.  I've found the same works well for me in far less tenuous situations.  

tl;dr: when you get caught in an embarrassing situation, own your shit, admit that you've erred, and apologize if necessary.   It lets you get on with life."

10269,"We started talking online where she told me all about herself, including how she was in wheelchair. Eventually she told me she wanted my dick in her, so a few days later I went to her house. She greeted me at the door in her chair wearing a white shirt and a khaki skirt. I sat on the couch, chatted a few minutes before she pushed herself to lay across my lap. Her skirt pushed up enough for me to see she wasn't wearing panties. After making out for a little she began to get feisty.

The sex was great. I ate her out, she returned the favor. I would be on top, she would ride me. I'm certain she loved the fact that I could lift and move her to different positions that she had not done before. Her couch was the right hight for her to sit up and give me oral, or turn her over and do it doggy style. We would meet about once a week for fun. Talking on the phone, I could her the anticipation in her voice.

I don't mind being used for sex, but I was in a bad time of my life and didn't want a relationship while she began to want more. We stopped seeing eachother shortly after. I ended up talking to her about a year afterwards; she moved in with her boyfriend and was enjoying herself there. I must had done something right because she began to talk about how much she loved me giving it to her doggy style. No I didn't hookup with her again, I had a girlfriend myself. I would go for her again if presented the opportunity. "

10302,"He made a mistake whilst following orders, he caused harm, but it was in no way his intention to be negligent.  He is guilty yes, but he is innocent in the sense that he didn't think he was killing people when he fired.  

For those who don't know tanks and how they work, he wasn't alone in there, he is part of the bigger machine.  One guy calls out the coordinates to aim at, one guy drives the tank, one guy loads the ammo and one guy puts in the coordinates and fires.  He missed or messed up the alignment step and did everything else properly.  Tanks do not always fire in a straight line, they fire in arcs, that is, they fire upwards to give the shell more distance and altitude to be able to hit things beyond tree lines, hills, etc...  So when he put in the coordinates he was given, he put them in properly, but due to poor collimation, the barrel wasn't aimed where he thought it was despite the equipment telling him it was (like a compass where you have to set the north yourself [which you do if you know about Magnetic Deviation], if you don't set it properly, you won't get good results).  He fired and the shell's trajectory landed on people who were near-by.  Had nobody gotten killed, he still would have missed the target, would the mistake have been the same?  Indeed, same mistake, different results, one ruins his life and the other is a slap on the wrist.

One day, when I was about 12, there was an accident right in front of my house. I was playing in the yard, and when my mom rushed out to see if she could help anyone, I followed along. This dude had gotten rear ended pretty badly. My mom was talking to him and he seemed pretty shaken up but not hurt. He excused himself, saying he had to call his daughter because he was supposed to pick her up. 

He is talking to her, and he's laughing saying: ""You're going to kill me but I'm not gonna be able to pick you up for a while, someone rear ended me!""... ""I'll be there as soon as I can. I love you."" 

Maybe two minutes later, the dude collapses right in front of me, maybe 10 feet away. Paramedics arrived very shortly after and the man is dead; probably from a heart attack, they tell my mom.

Edit: Okay, I'm getting a lot of replies, some of which are paragraphs long, so I'm going to clarify before anyone else wastes their time on my comment. 

What I meant is that everyone - yes, everyone - tries to conform in some way. If you sit down with a group of 10 other people and work on a project, and if those other people agree on an idea that you think is *bullshit*, you most likely won't say anything because you don't want to sound like an asshole or ruin the project for those other people. 

And you most likely also won't take a stroll in the city wearing ridiculous clothing (like a swimsuit or a ballgown) on an average day because you understand that that's not how it's *done* - you *know* that better attire would be jeans, a T-shirt, a suit, or something similar.

My whole point here is that many people who are in college or have graduated act as if teenagers are so stupid for wanting to fit in. And yes, we do care *way* too much (a week ago it took me 2 hours to choose a dress for a banquet because I didn't want to be over- or under-dressed). But it's not like everyone just completely stops caring once we turn 21. You care and you will always care, even if it's less than 12-18 year olds.

Edit x2: ""Well I never cared about others' opinions in high school, I was so mature."" Yes you did. Are you telling me that if you wanted to, you'd have gone to school with no pants on because it's more comfortable that way? "

10462,"I posted this a while back and the response was very therapeutic for me. I've been thinking about it a lot again and would like to throw it out there for discussion again:

During my third year of college I became extremely close (like family close) with a bunch of my neighbors (guys and girls alike) in my apartment complex. We all hung out almost every night. We would have dinner together all the time and take the bus downtown to the bars multiple nights a week.

One night on the bus we met a guy named Issac who was really quiet but friendly enough if engaged in conversation. We invited him to come with us and had a blast drinking all night. 

It was pretty obvious that Isaac didn't have many friends; he was slightly awkward and new to town. We started inviting him to hang out with us and had a good time with him for a few weeks, until he brought a friend to a party we were throwing. It was a party for a football game and there were probably 30-40 people in attendance. I didn't see what actually happened but Katie (girl hosting the party) kicked them out. Apparently Issac and his friend were about to shoot heroin in the middle of the party and everyone got really bugged out.

Over the next few days Issac starts texting all of us to apologize for bringing heroin to the party, but everyone was ignoring him. I was the stoner of the group and smoked and hooked Issac up a few times without the rest of the group. I didn't know what to do--I smoked and drank like any other college student, but have lost more than a few friends to heroin and didn't want to be associated with it at all. Issac realized that everyone was ignoring him and started hitting me up like crazy. I'm a pretty nice guy and I think he figured if anyone out of the group would hang out with him, it'd be me. I felt torn but didn't respond.

A few days later I ran into Issac downtown between classes and he tried to make plans to hang out with me. At the time I didn't have the heart to tell him I wasn't interested in being his friend anymore, so I just told him to hit me up some time. He did, and again I ignored him.

Fast-forward two days. Issac is dead. We never heard what the official cause of death was but one of our group's girlfriend's cousin's boyfriend or something or other was an emergency responder and said something about a suicide involving heroin and ice cold bath water. Whatever happened, Issac killed himself.

He really wasn't a bad guy, and his suicide has deeply troubled me over the past seven years. I have always wondered if I had just reached out to him and tried to help him with his addiction, or just be his friend, maybe he'd be alive. 

If you read this, thanks. I've only told a few people about this and it feels good to put it all into drunken words.


EDIT:
This story seems to hit home with a lot of folks when I tell it. A lot of people beat me up for turning a cold shoulder, but I feel I should elaborate a little more on where I'm from and how old I was when this happened. This all happened at WVU around 2009-10. I was only 21 or so when it all happened and had unfortunately seen the effects of heroin on individuals and there families. 

I'm from a small, economically depressed area of WV where drugs and crime are rampant. Our economy collapsed 15 years ago when the steel industry went under. A lot of people turned to drugs and gambling and before long heroin was a fucking plague on my hometown. Before I turned 21 I had already lost 3 friends to that pestilence and now that I'm 28, I've lost over 10. 

I had tried to help my friends before but what I have learned is that addicts reach a certain degree where nothing and no one else matters. If they are an adult, there is legally nothing you can do to help them. They will push those who wish to help them away because they realize that ""help"" means they must end their addiction. 

I've had addict friends steal from me, lie to me, and completely fuck me over--so when it came down to Isaac, I suppose part of me didn't want to deal with that again. I had left my small, burned out town and had made it to a big college town where life was different. I was on my own and didn't want to back track.

In retrospect, would I have helped him? Yes. I would have at least talked to him. If it didn't bother me I wouldn't be posting about it to strangers on the Internet for second opinions. I've come a long way from the 21 year old party animal I once was. This was just one event I've never quite been able to leave in the past. "

10606,"Everyone important in that show is deeply broken.

* Rei is suffering severe depression at having been killed at an early age and knowing she's just a copy of herself.  She's also possibly a victim of sexual grooming, given Gendo's possessive nature of her and how he touches her at Instrumentality.

* Asuka is a mess of insecurities covered thinly with aggression and bragging from witnessing her mother's descent into madness and suicide trying to take a proxy of her with her.  She's arguably the most broken of the three and even attempts suicide once her superiority is broken and after suffering mind-rape by an Angel that made her relive the worst day of her life.

* Misato is clearly suffering PTSD from witnessing Second Impact combined with survivor's guilt from being pushed by her father into the escape boat.  (You can imagine almost every character in the show has less degrees of these issues too, but Misato is the most blatant.)  She also has attachment issues leading to a dependent relationship with a man that cheated on her and inappropriate feelings towards Shinji.

* Ritsuko has mild sociopathic tendencies that explode by the end of the series and self-esteem issues from comparing herself to a seemingly unloving mother, leading her to a relationship with the heartless and neglectful man who killed her, and who she *knows* cares more about Rei than her.

* Gendo takes the cake with sociopathic narcissism and misplaced blame over his own role in his wife's death towards Shinji.  He is literally willing to kill the entire world to reunite with her and has a rather creepy relationship with Rei that may include some psycho-sexual elements (but probably not physical abuse).  Gendo as a young man was noted for a violent temper before he met Yui, and though he masters his impulses later in life, it's clear that he doesn't give a damn about anyone or anything other than his wife, which hints at what kind of lonely life he must have led before he met her.

And that doesn't touch on the issues of many minor characters, like Maya's repressed sexuality and crush on a superior, Touji's family dealing with his sister having her legs crushed, Kensuke's social awkwardness, etc."

OK *balance* may not require taking children, but you're implying the practice makes the Jedi bad people when it's quite the opposite. People with significant Force potential could probably do serious damage and could easily have no idea how to control their powers or their emotions without intensive guidance from someone else who actually *gets* it. They need help from others who know what it's like tapping into life itself, sensing other people's emotions, literally feeling the pain of others, controlling your urge to just murder someone in an unstoppable, unprovable way when you get pissed off, or whatever.

I can see arguing the Jedi didn't really get it and precipitated the Republic's downfall, but saying they're evil or implying it was inexcusably harsh taking children from their parents misses the mark."

Personally my periods are very unpredictable and always have been. If I wear pads or pantyliners just in case, honestly it gets expensive because it can take over a week from ""my period should be here"" to ""ah, there it is"". 

I've pretty much given up. Unless I'm getting an obvious symptom like cramps, I don't bother. I carry supplies to work just in case I start there, but if I start in the middle of the night and bleed on my clothes/sheets then I just get up and wash my sheets in the morning. Fuck it.

He said he did and basically said get to your final as quick as you can.

But if you're studying the effect of ""Is a shotgun blast to the head lethal for humans?"" and 10/10 humans die instantly, you can probably stop killing people. Absurd example but it's to make the point. The stronger the effect, the less samples you need to be confident that what you're seeing isn't random.

He was carrying on an affair with Camilla, who he could not marry, when his mother told him to marry and produce an heir or else. So he married Diana. She was sweet and clearly besotted with him. He looked at her with disgust and barely veiled contempt (look at some footage before their wedding ehhhhch). And by all accounts he treated her very poorly and kept right on boffing old Camilla. Diana was hardly cold in the ground when he trotted Camilla out again and finally put a ring on it because he no longer needed a suitable wife to bear him heirs. He is a cretin. He should simply have abdicated his position (as Edward did) and married Camilla from the outset.

Well, when she pulled the food out of the oven we could tell something didn't smell quite right. We all got pretty generous portions of the casserole (or whatever it was) on our plates and started eating. It was awful. Apparently, she did not understand the difference between a ""clove"" of garlic and a ""head"" of garlic.  She peeled, diced, and pressed 3 full heads of garlic and put them in the casserole.  We all tried our hardest to eat, but god did it burn. We eventually told her to try it herself and when she took a bite she started to gag!

10771,"My Opa was drafted in '44, as soon as he was eligible. He never fired a shot; he was walking down the street in Czechoslovakia (iirc) to buy nylons for his girlfriend when he was captured by the Americans. He was a POW for the rest of the war, but all things considered, they didn't treat him badly and he became quite friendly with the guards. He described learning basic English through trial and error; if someone asked something like ""Do you want a cigarette?"" that he didn't understand, he'd reply either yes or no and see what happened. After the war his contacts in the US army helped him emigrate to the US, and he considered the day he got citizenship the proudest day of his life. 

My Oma was sent to live with her grandparents during the war, in Wels in Austria near a concentration camp. Her grandfather was a hardcore Nazi, and my Oma and her grandmother hid American soldiers in the attic under his nose. The war ended when my Oma was 17. The liberating soldiers had the townspeople bury the bodies from the concentration camp. 

My grandparents met when my Oma worked in an immigration office, and two weeks later they were married and on a boat to America. I always wondered what would make someone leave everything they knew for basically a stranger, but now I kind of understand that it was less true love and more a chance to get the hell out of dodge. 

Edited to add: my Opa's father died in a Russian POW camp, his brother was never heard from again after joining the army. All but one of his uncles were killed as well. My uncle on my dad's side is a hobby genaeologist and after getting pretty far into that side of the family, offered to try his hand at my mom's. Even though basically all men on both sides of the right age fought in the war, of my dad's side (American) almost every man lived through the war, and on my mom's side (German) almost every man died in it.

In high school we had a multiple choice test using scantrons. One of the really smart students filled out his answers sitting in the left most row, first seat. Put the scantron in his pocket so that it stuck out a little bit. Then walked to the opposite side of the room to sharpen his pencil and the student in the first seat of the last row took the scantron and used it to fill out his. Then that scantron was passed all the way back up and down the rows all the way back to the student in the first row.

10786,"A friend from Iowa once pointed out that another friend and I, both from Southern California, were constantly late to events despite being well organized in other aspects of our lives.

I realized then how much the traffic of where I'd grown up had influenced my sense of time. 

Remember that scene is Clueless when Cher's stranded in the Valley and her dad tells her to be home in 20 minutes because ""everything in L.A. is 20 minutes away""? Well, that's true if there isn't any traffic. The reality is that 20 minutes can easily and unexpectedly turn into an hour or more if something happens. Because of this, it was unspoken etiquette in the community to be on time at best but never early, and to make allowances for people who hit traffic.

So when my friends would say ""let's meet at four"", the Californians would hear ""we'll meet at four, unless something comes up, in which case as close to four as possible,"" whereas Iowa would hear, ""we're all going to be in place at 3:55"".

Next the nations of the world will close in around Russia and begin to attack. Then I'll move my ships to Russia's coast and it's outlying cities are quickly annexed and indoctrinated with my Empire's dogmas. I will then bombard Moscow and Russia falls swiftly under my grasp.

With the capital in my hands only the last vestiges of Russia remain. I set about burning Russia's heritage and Russia's past.

&gt;Comics Stark and MCU Stark aren't the same guy anyway. Maybe I'm misinterpreting his actions, but it really doesn't seem like he wants to put her in that position. Hell, being Iron Man is arguably an addiction for him at this point, and a massive chunk of his motivation across a bunch of the movies has been a (misguided) attempt to keep his friends out of danger. Maybe he'll actually learn from his mistakes and that will lead to him trusting Pepper with a suit, but it seems that it's a ways down the road. I certainly can't see current Tony being ok with her being on the front lines.

Sure, Ned was bad enough.  But the Red Wedding... ack.

**********************

*edit* - just to expand on this....

Ned's death was hard.  He was the truly good guy, and his death, under those conditions, feel so abrupt, so harsh, so *unfair*...

But then we had Robb.  Robb embodied the principles his father had both lived and died for.  Robb was enjoying great success.  After all of the intrigue, after all of the subplots, some clarity was coming to the story.  Robb would be the new hope, the new good king; he would right the wrongs, and against terrible odds, would unite the realm, becoming a greater king than his father ever would have been.

But then, in violation of some of the oldest laws of civilization, Robb was not only murdered, but betrayed at what should have been a joyous event... all in the name of petty vengeance.  Murdered even as his mother begged for his life.  Then mutilated post mortem, just for the sake of evil.

All of the hope was gone.  Everything was ruined.

10884,"She was an incredible woman. She grew up in rural Ireland and being Catholic was absolutely central to her identity. She moved straight to London to work as a nurse when the Blitz started and, when the war was over, she stayed. Now I am a bit older, I feel like most of her choices in life were a deliberate attempt to challenge herself to respond with love, regardless of the situation. She loved babies and did a lot of ob-gyn work but always shook her head if anyone asked her about abortion. She took care of women who'd had backstreet abortions and, regardless of doctrine, never questioned if it should be legal or not ever again. 


She kept rising, so far as a woman could rise through the medical field in those days, and when she was about 35 she met my grandfather who, the story goes, was a confirmed bachelor. He came home after one evening with her and announced he'd met the woman he wanted to marry. My biggest memory of them as a couple was that he had to sit in a special armchair because his back hurt and they'd hold hands across the gap between their chairs. They had my Dad and they made a point of inviting anyone they knew who'd be alone at Christmas to their house so it was always a revolving door at their house. She threw herself into motherhood and at one point saved my Dad's life with her nursing skills (as you do) but she got a little restless so, when my Dad went to university, she decided it was time she occupied herself as well. Women had more access to education at that point so she got a degree and opened the first bereavement counselling service in her local area, specialising in children (this detail was also always mentioned in passing, as if it wasn't a massive achivement).


She was never that comfortable with it when my Dad drifted away from Catholicism (apparently there were a lot of pictures of the Pope in her house and you were expected to cross yourself when you went over the threshold at this point!). She was apparently rather upset that he didn't marry my Mum in a Catholic church but she softened a lot over the years and eventually came to the conclusion that God doesn't care about your religion or the beliefs of the people you are helping as long as you help: what matters is that you don't stand aside or turn a blind eye. My Dad clearly took that on board because he became a Human Rights lawyer and did a bunch of stuff with amnesty and LGBT people. My Mum never quite forgave her for being that religious so she used to tell us not to get too close to us or she'd use us. Her upbringing was strict and she was still very obviously religious (she'd invite nuns and priests to dinner on the regular) so we kind of took our Mum at her word and didn't really realise how mislead we were until we were older and our grandma didn't have much longer left.


Now I'm older, I feel really silly for doubting her. She never really drew attention to herself, though. We only really heard a lot of this stuff in brief snippets before she'd change the subject and ask us how we were doing. I didn't realise how little I knew of her early life and the sacrifices she made until her funeral, where literally everybody attending had a story about her that made them smile. She led such a good life that even her funeral was happy and if I am ever half the woman she was, I will consider my life a success. "

- Insecurity is very unattractive and can be very self destructive. Even if you have those feelings sometimes, refrain from constantly bringing it up to your SO. Someone can only hear ""I feel like you're going to leave me for someone better"" so many times before it actually starts sounding like a good idea... 

- Don't talk shit about your partner to your friends/family. Even in a huge fight, find just one person to confide in if you really need to talk about it. Or talk anonymously about it online. When you finally resolve a fight and go back to loving your partner, your friends and family will still remember all the bad things you said about them. 

- Being passive aggressive is going to delay a peaceful resolution and only make the fighting worse. If something bothers you, talk. If your partner talks to you about something, listen. 

- For the love of god keep most of that shit off social media. Especially arguments. 

- Don't lose who you were. It's easy to be comfortable in a relationship, but that doesn't mean to stop practicing your hobby, or to stop working out, or to start dressing sloppier. You want to stay just as datable as the first time you met. A) your partner will still find you attractive even after years, B) You will feel just as happy and confident which is necessary for a good relationship, C) If you do happen to have a break up you are still able to ""get out there"" without taking months/years to get back in shape.

Both sisters act as pivot points for the plot,  outside influences that affect the character regardless of his actions.  If there was one sister then the metaphor for life's futility would be lost since she would be considered an antagonist to the good intentions of the main character. If both were absent then the main character would be truly in control of his life,  and the distraction would not occur or convey the same message,  because throughout the story his intentions would eventually be the change he needs.

I LOVE being alone to the point where I need to have a few hours to myself every day. She didn't understand this at all and didn't seem to understand the concept of personal space either. It wasn't a day before people were snapping at her and telling her to shut up. Earphones in and concentrating on my book didn't stop her from yapping in my ear. Lying on the bed with my back to the room and earphones in? Nope. The only time we got a bit of peace was when she would fuck off to be with a group of men who she'd become a completely different person around of course. Or when she was sleeping. She's fucked off to a different country now, thank god."

Not by any copyright lawyers either.

There are procedures for all of this. First the owner of the copyright will notify the ISP. Then the ISP will notify you.

Civil lawyers cannot ""fine"" you. It sounds to me like someone sniffed your traffic, got your address and sent you a fake summons."

Once when I was 10, my mom and I were sleeping in my Grandpa's bed. I couldn't sleep and I was facing the middle of the bed so the back of my head was near the space between the bed and the wall/window. All of a sudden, I feel something poke the back of my head twice. I was petrified and froze so I never turned my head to see what was poking me.

10993,"I was doing my MSc in Information Science, and I started runnig a TOR enode for fun, while the computer finished doing some calculations.

I was booted from the university network, and received an email indicating that their network had identified me and my computer (complete with MAC address). 

I was doing a postgrad program on IT, so I had to acquiesce to their demands. Then again, I knew enough to know that they didn't have enough evidence to charge me.

Anyway, thy made a note on my record, I had to sign a form saying that I had downloaded stuff via torrents, and that I had deleted the content. I refused, because I had not seen any evidence, and they sent me to talk to the DMCA compliance officer, a director level person located in a bunker behind bulletproof glass, RFID badges AND keypad.

They insisted, sent me to talk to a student doing an internship, and they couldn't give me a straight answer. Their excuse was that it was a civil matter, and that it didn't matter, which is completely false, btw.

So, in the end, I refused to sign the paper, they made me watch a video about the perils of downloading, and I learned that exit node TOR are frowned upon on public universities, that they have CISCO machines that detect a torrent in seconds, and that they have DMCA compliance officers that wield an incredible amount of power."

There are probable scenarios where you win 1 time, 2 times, 3 times, and so on.  So to calculate the odds of winning at least once, the easier way than summing all of those possible winning scenarios is to find the odds of not winning, then reducing one by that value. 

Say x = 100, so the odds of not winning 100 times in a row are (99/100)^100 

The compliment of that is simply 1 - (99/100)^100 = 0.63397

We were reading the book The Cay, which has some race issues in it. He's very passionate about injustices and usually led the discussions in class about the race issues.

The main character then changes his view of the black man and accepts him as a friend and equal.

We weren't going to go to the ER but then my neck started hurting so we went. While in the waiting room a grandmother and her teenage granddaughter came in needing to see a doctor. They both had tablets but only one of them had headphones. The teenager had her headphones plugged in and was listening to music. The grandmother did not have headphones and started playing rap music with very explicit lyrics at full volume. There were other people in the waiting room with young kids who were shocked she was doing that. No one said anything to her about it and after 5 minutes I couldn't take it anymore. I asked if she could please turn it down and she very loudly told me to mind my own fucking business and shut the fuck up. I was dumbfounded at her response. Instead of responding to her I simply got up and walked over to the nurse's station and explained the situation to the nurse. She immediately went over to the woman and told her she could not have the volume up on her tablet and asked her to put headphones on or turn the music off. The old lady proceeded to cuss the nurse out. The nurse called security and they came and told the woman to cut that shit out or they would have to make her leave. She wouldn't stop and so they kicked her and her granddaughter, who was mortified at the grandmother's behavior, out of the hospital. I'm not sure why the granddaughter needed to see a doctor but because of her grandmother's rude and disrespectful behavior they ended up having to find medical help elsewhere. I could not believe this woman who had to be at least 60 would do something like that. "

We had a couple kids wear their trench coats. We had plenty of awkward white boys spouting really bad Japanese. I saw the naruto headbands. They often didn't shower much. Looked down on people who watched certain shows or didn't watch other shows. Looked down on dubs. Want to fuck every anime female they see. 

Now they weren't all like that. Plenty just liked anime. But it's interesting to see how these stereotypes were quite painfully real. The fans can make it hard to be into anime. I went to an anime convention once. I had fun, but a lot of the people there were just too much. And it smelled REALLY bad in some areas. "

He also just was all around strange. Now in 1st grade I was pretty well known, so I thought, it's time to get rid of this Gary. So me being the evil 1st grader, I took my Goofy lunch box and threw it on the roof. I went back into class, acted normal and then once lunch came told our teacher I just saw Gary throw MY lunchbox on the roof. I even got my best friend at the time to say he saw it too, and some other Gary-haters joined in saying ""he just threw it for no reason!"" So the principal got involved came up to us on the playground asked if I threw it up and I said ""what? No!"" And Gary said the same thing. But nobody believed him. So everybody thought he was a liar, including the teachers and staff. He had trouble doing his homework as he was a little slow, so his work would be late but the teacher just assumed he never did his work. Nobody wanted to be friends with him afterwards. Nobody liked him. Then he moved away for a couple years as he was getting bullied by other kids, but I was the final kick. Rumor  is his credits from the school didn't transfer as he wasn't in it long enough. So he had to be held back. I'm graduating in 11 days, he still has one more year to go. He goes to my school now too. Everytime I see him I feel so bad... This is the only thing I truly regret deep down. "

During training I was told the following ""If they're blind, they most likely will not qualify for the higher tier"" Doesn't sound too bad really? Well, 1, we were told this before be began training on how to handle difficult situations. And 2, we were shown real profiles of current disability receivers, not fictional. I could access everyones information (British Citizens) before I could even start the job. Now this is the bad part. We had targets to cancel or sanction peoples benefits. This worked when we knew there was false claims and fraudulent activity. But what happened when there wasn't any wrong-doing?? 

We still had to sanction them, it was like a lucky dip, and we were even congratulated and celebrated when we met the target. I phoned a guy to tell him. He killed himself, while I was on the phone. I left not long after that and I've contacted some tabloids about this. But last time someone did this (Universal Credit having targets for sanctioning people). Fuck all got done, was in the paper but it was quickly forgotten about. People are dying because of this PIP. Look for yourselves, we are demonising the weak and poor of this country and there is currently a pending investigation into the government changes to benefits which has led to these deaths, from cutting money to other benefits !

I guess the dumbass didn't learn cuz he came back toward the end and got the shit beat out of him by brothers #1 and #3 in our parking lot.

Right as I realized that made no sense, the second bomb went off. I remember the *heat* from the blast. It was this super strong HOT wind.

I've never been able to forget the carnage I saw when I regained my balance. I can't watch footage of it without losing my shit. This one guy stumbled in to me with his arm just dangling right below his shoulder. The site of it gave me instant clarity. I told my now wife I had to go and hung up the phone. I did not want her to hear me die if there was another bomb. I ran for Fairfield street. I helped an older guy stumble out of the blast zone and saw how large the damage was. People crawling out of the glass from Max Brenner's. Just...parts of people on the sidewalk. 

I then sprinted back to my job 2 blocks away. I was the General Manager and had college kids working for me. Sprinted back, got all my staff and customers in the back of the building away from windows until Boston PD gave us an all clear to leave.

Judge Dredd is a cyberpunk satire of solving brutal inequality, inefficacy of any social remedies and safety nets, and a general Used Future with brute suppression and dissonance-ridden Lawful Good behavior.

And remember Dredd is really a serial. The recent film for example makes him look generally heroic I guess, but overall that's just one day in his life where he took down someone undeniably fucked up as opposed to doing something equally brutal to someone more morally palatable...and even still he does really harsh stuff like sentencing the guy outside Peach Trees to years in prison for vagrancy."

The next thing I remember is my dad taking me to pick up a lady and her daughter who eventually became my stepmom and stepsister. After a few years I would be taken back and forth between my parents every few years but grew to resent my mom for initially abandoning me.

She died when I was 23 and I flew back home to bury her. My sisters and I share different fathers and they didn't like mine. I never really understood that since he cared for me so much and was a nice person to everyone, his work even made him have an amazing funeral and some rich family donated a grave at a nice cemetery. When I asked them why they disliked him so much and why mom abandoned me when I was so young, they finally told me that he would beat her.

It all eventually dawned on me that my dad was a wife beater. My stepmother had become battered and angry over the years and I never put it all together.

I swallowed it down and ran to the fridge and attempted to chug some milk. I immediately threw up right afterwords My cheeks and throat were starting to swell up and my friend couldn't help but just laugh.

Uhh... nope. Not at all. Literally the first time we are introduced to her, she's proudly narrating us the story of how she framed her previous musical coach for inappropriately touching some of the kids because she wasn't chosen for a part or something. She's a legitimately awful human being, and the show made no excuses whatsoever for her actions since day one.

Hell, even in Season 2 she sent that one student (Charice) to a crack house so that she would end up missing some audition because Rachel was afraid she was going to get usurped as the lead.

Her *one* positive trait is that she is undeniably talented. Like, seriously. It's almost comical just how much better she is than every single member of New Directions both during her time at McKinley and after. The only one to ever come close to her was Mercedes, and even she couldn't do everything that Rachel could. This is why Rachel was so interesting: you find yourself rooting for her despite being so genuinely unlikable because she has the talent to truly succeed in competitions.

This is also why she got relentlessly bullied in the school despite being beautiful. Her personality is so shrill and annoying that it cancels out whatever positive qualities she had."

So they're basically search engine optimizing *themselves* and then picking clear, predictable sex acts that will already be receiving searches. This is also the same way people sell eBooks and target YouTube videos. Then the porn star spends their career either making videos people want to see, or only do so long enough that their name itself has a following, then they slide down into lower and lower quality (and thereby cost) while they lap up the residuals on their brand. Once they have their formula knocked together, they stop prioritizing their work's quality, because they have a captive audience. (Counterpoint: sites like xart, metart, etc, are 'artisanal porn' that establish a 'master' level of base video quality, often gaming the video for emotional intensity.)

It shares a lot in common with a brand that's all-brand-no-substance (like Beats), which first gets popular at a high investment cost, and then 'sells out' which causes it to slide down to a quality level that a Shenzhen factory worker wouldn't accept."

11574,"Three men were standing in line to get into heaven one day. Apparently it had been a pretty busy day, though, so Peter had to tell the first one, ""Heaven's getting pretty close to full today, and I've been asked to admit only people who have had particularly horrible deaths. So what's your story?"" 

So the first man replies: ""Well, for a while I've suspected my wife has been cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her red-handed. As I came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong, but all my searching around didn't reveal where this other guy could have been hiding. Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this man hanging off the railing in his boxer shorts, 25 floors above ground! By now I was really mad, so I started beating on him and kicking him, but wouldn't you know it, he wouldn't fall off. So finally I went back into my apartment and got a hammer and starting hammering on his fingers. Of course, he couldn't stand that for long, so he let go and fell -- but even after 25 stories, he fell and bounced off the apartment awning and into the bushes, stunned but okay. I couldn't stand it anymore, so I ran into the kitchen, pushed the fridge to the balconyover the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all the stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart attack and died there on the spot."" 

""That sounds like a pretty bad day to me,"" said Peter, and let the man in. 

The second man comes up and Peter explains to him about heaven being full, and again asks for his story. 

""It's been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my apartment building, and every morning I do my exercises out on my balcony. Well, this morning, my wife must have moved some of the potted plants around and I tripped and fell over the edge. But I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. I knew I couldn't hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the balcony. I thought for sure I was saved, when he started beating on me and kicking me. I held on the best I could until he ran into his apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my hands. Finally I just let go, but again I got lucky and fell onto the awning and bounced into the bushes below, stunned but all right. Just when I was thinking I was going to be okay, this refrigerator comes falling out of the sky and crushes me instantly, and now I'm here."" 

Once again, Peter had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible death. 

The third man came to the front of the line, and again Peter explained that heaven was full and asked for his story. 

""Picture this,"" says the third man looking around nervously, ""I'm hiding naked, inside this refrigerator..."" "

11577,"In the distant future, the government creates a brutal plan to bring order to a country on the brink of chaos. Children will be sent to an arena where they will fight to the death. Weapons are picked at random, and some are more lucky than others. Only one can survive. However, in an unexpected twist never seen before, a boy and a girl, two lovers, manage to break the odds and both are declared winners.

That's a basic summary of both books/movies. The similarities between the two franchises goes beyond kids fighting to the death. It's the reason behind why the Battle Royale act and the Hunger Games were created (to instill fear into the rebellious and chaotic youth/to instill fear into the rebellious districts), and the fact two lovers both managed to ""win"" their games despite the fact only one winner was allowed for each game. 

E. For the record, I actually really like both franchises. I thought the Hunger Games had excellent worldbuilding. But in the end of the day, the two stories are just too similar for comfort. Hamlet and the Lion King are two very different stories on paper. One takes place in Denmark and the other takes place in Africa. And everyone is animals. But when you look at the basic plot points, they're essentially the same story. They're just dressed up differently. 

The Hunger Games and Battle Royale are the same way. Dressed differently, but the core story is the same. Of course, that's just the first book. Catching Fire and Mockingjay turn into their own stories. So I'll give it that."

11583,"This is one of my favorite stories from high school. I'm not a teacher, but this is a story about my teacher's response to one particular smart-ass answer.

So my high school mythology teacher, Mr. D, would have his honors class students help him grade tests from the other classes. He would always require properly spelled write-in answers. No multiple choice for him. So we'd get the tests, he'd read off the answers, and we'd mark them accordingly.

One of his questions was ""Who was the wife of King Minos?"" Now according to our Greek lore, Pasiphae, Minos's wife, was the one who had sex with a bull and gave birth to the Minotaur.

So Mr. D tells us that the answer is Pasiphae, and one of the students kinda timidly raises his hand. ""Uhhh..."" Mr. D goes ""Whatcha got?""

""Um.... they wrote 'Bull Slut.'""

The class breaks into laughter, Mr. D grins and thinks about it a second. ""I like it! Half credit.""

That's why he was everyone's favorite teacher. Good sense of humor, and the fact that the answerer knew that Minos's wife was the one who birthed the Minotaur meant that at least some of the mental connections were there, so they got credit. Great guy."

[Classifying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_finite_simple_groups) finite simple groups just means creating a list of all possible finite simple groups. Namely, it turns out that all finite simple groups are either:

* A [cyclic group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_group) of prime order (the *order* of a group is the number of elements in the group). These are groups residue classes mod p under addition.
* An [alternating group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_group) of ~~order~~ a string of size &gt;= 5. These are groups of [even permutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_of_a_permutation) of a finite number of elements.

Once I noticed immediately after leaving the grocery store that someone was following me, made several turns down roads that no one would have any reason to turn into as well to make sure (they kept following me) and I immediately turned back towards the city and drove to the police station and parked there. I have no idea who was following me or why but they stalled for a minute and then sped away pretty quickly once they realized that I wasn't leaving where I was parked. I stayed for like half an hour sitting there and then made my way home, didn't see the car again.

The other time I was with my roommate and neither of us noticed anyone following us until we got home and were pulling into the driveway. It was very late, very dark out, and we were sitting there getting ready to go in when we noticed a truck just idling in the road very near to our house. We had no neighbors then and it's a pretty rural area so there is literally *zero* reason why anyone would be there. The truck had no lights on, we couldn't tell who was in it or anything, and it was just really creepy. We did not get out of the car, just sat there watching it. It must have been there for a good 10-15 minutes before finally they switched their bright lights on and hit the gas, speeding away up the road, and as it went by we heard a man's voice from inside the truck screaming this ""hahaha"" laugh.

11596,"Let me first say, that I consider myself a social libertarian/egalitarian. I am me, and you are you. And the only thing that would ever garner my disrespect towards others is if they are people who cause or promote violence and/or discrimination against others. I'm not perfectly unbiased (nobody is), but I do try to be fair and equal in my treatment of everyone I come into contact with. 

That being said, as a cisgendered heterosexual male from a wealthy upbringing, I don't think it's fair to be labeled as a bigot, a racist, or any other label others place on me because I may have have some criticisms of the LGBTQ community, Black Lives Matter movement, Women's rights movement etc.  All  of which are movements I legitimately support. 

It may sound petty to people who are suffering from far more serious things than I, but feel as if I have limited freedom of speech in these areas of debate. Praising and celebrating every statement and action of these movements is imperative in keeping your ""pc social record"" clean. And I don't think that's fair.

I was eating large meals every meal.  I didn't even realize just how bad it was until I started counting calories and weighing portion sizes (I'm now in the 120s).  A typical day at work would go as follows:

- Bagel with cream cheese at Dunkin Donuts on my way to work.  ~500 calories.  

- Also a fountain soda (need my caffeinated coke), another ~250

- 12 ct chick fil a nugget for lunch ~400 calories, dipping sauce ~100, fries ~400 and a chocolate shake ~550.

- Large plate full of pasta for dinner ~200 calories, smothered in a cream sauce ~400 calories, with pan-seared chicken ~200 calories, and at least another can of soda or two through the day ~300 calories.

In total at least 3300 calories... and that's if I didn't snack on anything.

I used to test video games.  One guy on my team, we'll call him ""Stevebob,"" spent his entire shift on the phone.  He never worked.  If he had just pretended to work like 90% of the other testers, he'd have been fine, but he really didn't care at all and refused to put in even minimal effort.

So the floor manager came up one night and asked Stevebob to meet him in his office.  This meant Stevebob was being fired.  Promotions always happened on the floor in front of everyone so we'd all get inspired or something.  I knew it, Stevebob knew it, the other 298 testers working there knew it (we literally worked in a giant basement, just one massive room with offices in the middle).

Of course, we all watch as Stevebob approaches the manager's office.  Not much really happens on these shifts so this was a welcome respite from the drudgery of testing.

But Stevebob didn't enter the office.  He stopped outside, about seven feet from the glass door.  He just stood there, staring down the manager who was sitting behind his desk with his most important and official face on.

Stevebob stares down the manager and slowly, methodically, removes his belt.  He drops his pants.  Then, while maintaining eye contact with the manager the *entire time*, Stevebob squatted down, pulled down his boxers, and took a shit right there on the floor."

As soon as we take two steep turns, we hear a growl. Turning back, we see an honest to god fucking tiger standing there.

- Another guy was dating one girl, but hooked up with that girl's younger sister and got nudes from the younger sister. Older girl reported him.
- Another guy was also expelled for sexual assault, but I don't know what he did exactly.
- One guy was the class president, and at the end of the year during his final speech, he had a mental breakdown. He started screaming curses at everyone, especially teachers (lol) and began to strip. By the end, he was on a rant about how our headmaster was a Caribbean immigrant shit and he was down to his underwear.
- Fifth guy went batshit crazy when his girlfriend broke up with him and broke 4 Macs and ripped 7 books in half, along with breaking other things. $6k worth of damages.
- Last guy was caught smoking a blunt in the headmaster's private bathroom

Her stepfather simply said ""You're not bringing a girl into my house"". They're both very bad people altogether, but that just pissed myself and our friends off even more.

God bless her father though, whom is completely supportive, understanding and caring. If that vindictive woman hadn't gotten full custody of her, it'd be so much easier to help.

I was always the unpopular kid sitting by themselves alone, and thanks to a longstanding history of playing mean jokes on me I thought that this was also a prank.

Long story short, on the night specified she apparently drives off a cliff ""by accident"". Police and all that look into the death and say it was just because she lost control of the car on a very dark night with wet roads. Over the next few days there's pictures of her put up over the school and I suddenly notice it's the same school portrait from the flashdrive. So that night I carefully reread the note on the flashdrive, confirm its the same picture and notice that the note says that she'll drive off the cliff on her way home from work on the day that she did.

Next day, the whole class is offically informed about her death and all the standard pocedure happens. A couple of weeks later we get told that her brother (who was attending a different school) will be transferring to ours.

One day I was riding my bike back home from my friend's house when that lab was in the front yard and chased me down. I tried to get away but that dog tore up my leg and ankle really bad. (Still have scars 14 years later.) I remember getting home and sitting on the steps with my parents trying to bandage me up and stop bleeding. Willy came over and looked at my leg then looked up and had this look like ""Nobody hurts my humans!"" 30+ pound Willy bolted out the door straight to the neighbors house like a enraged cat avenger! He flew straight at that huge black Labrador and clawed up his sorry dog butt. After that the dog never barked at me, never even got worked up when I rode by. Because that dog knew Willy was king. Every night till he passed Willy would sleep on my bed. And I slept soundly knowing nothing could hurt me as long as Willy was there.

If you use anything else nearly, you're probably going to have BV and *that's* gross. I didn't mean don't clean your pussy. But the vagina and vulva are sensitive.

* Alpha is officially spelled spelled Alfa, to avoid confusion for non-English and non-french speakers, who may not know that *ph* is pronunced as a *f*. Furthermore, Alpha is spelled Alfa in most non-English and non-french countries.

* Juliet is officially spelled Juliett because of french speakers, who may think that the ""t"" at the end is silent. In the french version, we use Juliette, which is the french version of the first name Juliet.

For people who don't know how the words have been chosen. They have to be short, to be intelligible even with bad reception, to have a similar pronunciation in all countries (or the biggest number of countries possible), to be of common usage so that anyone would know them beforehand, and to be ""likely to be understood in the context of others"". To give you an idea of how efficient it is, take a look at the 1927 ITU phonetic alphabet (Amsterdam, Baltimore, Canada, Denmark, Eddystone, Francisco, Gibraltar, Hanover, Italy, Jerusalem, Kimberley, Liverpool, Madagascar, Neufchatel, Ontario, Portugal, Quebec, Rivoli, Santiago, Tokio, Uruguay, Victoria, Washington, Xantippe, Yokohama, Zululand).

11920,"Not understanding when people aren't following their dreams.

Edit: relax guys. I absolutely follow my dreams, heck, even my passing ideas. I'm responding to the OPs question and people who come from money often do not understand that certain dreams require an amount of start-up and ongoing capital that someone from $ takes for granted.

For example, if someone is young and they dream of being a hockey goalie, that requires $ for gear, travel, league fees, etc...and that' just table stakes before you get into things like special training camps. Likewise in the arts, if you want to be a film maker, there's way more start-up costs than being a writer. (I know phone cameras have lowered the barrier to entry, but historically, this was true and the rest of film making is still relatively expensive. Pretend I said be a VR developer since that costs a few K at the moment.) 

Sure, there is probably a way to break into either of the above fields if you have a mono-focused person and an ultra-supportive parent(s), albeit of limited means. However, more likely the person from less money will have to do something else, like become a soccer goalie (much cheaper) or a writer for the time being, and either abandon the original dream or delay it. This happens all the time all-over the world. 

None of this is to say you shouldn't follow your dreams to the best of your ability. But don't kick yourself when you hear someone from more privilege give the well-intentioned, but clueless ""everyone should follow their dreams"" speech.  "

Aside from trying to calm down highly emotional situations with worried barks or smothering you with affection, for example, this food fiend always knows how to fake you out and steal a meal. We know her game, but she knows how to capitalize on brief seconds when we're off guard. 

Two examples:


1. Without fail, when company comes over and there are appetizers laid out on the table, she will excitedly run to the door barking to greet them (as always) but as soon as she sees we're focused on the guests in the hall, she'll run back over to the food while throwing the sound of her bark toward us down the hall to give the impression that she is still around. Once at the doorway, she bolts to the table and steals what she can before we realize it.


2. One time when I was hanging out eating in front of the TV, my wife came home and started talking to me from the doorway. As I'm focused on her and the conversation, this sly creature sneaks in between my legs without being felt and stealthily snags the last bite of my sandwich from the coffee table, slithering out of sight to enjoy it without even brushing up against me (and it was a tight space). I didn't realize it until I found myself grabbing at an empty plate.

From the corner of my eye I could see the old guy staring at me the entire time. Like, 5 minutes later I got fed up and said ""Why are you staring at me?"", he replied ""What's that thing you got in your hands there?""

I told him it was a portable video game system. Then he goes ""Aren't you a little old for those things?"", and he said it with kind of a smirk. I was shocked someone was judging me for it, so I snapped back without thinking ""Aren't you a little old to be alive?""

Mentally I started freaking out like OH MY GOD WHY THE FUCK DID I JUST SAY THAT HOLY SHIT WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ME. What made it worse was the look both of them gave me. It one of shock and saddness. The woman sitting across from me was in shock as well and just glared at me like ""What the fuck is wrong with you!?"".

Theodor Tobler, with his cousin Emil Baumann, developed a unique milk chocolate including nougat, almonds and honey with a distinctive triangular shape. The image of a bear is hidden in the Matterhorn high mountain, symbolizing the town of the chocolate's origin.    They are packaged in a yellow-colored cardboard box that is in the shape of a slightly larger triangular prism. If the Toblerone chocolate bar was of a different shape, the chocolate would not fit inside of its own box and would probably get whoever was in charge of deciding the shape fired.

He says to the Chief, ""Now I know this ain't how it's supposed to be done, and I'm grateful and all, but that wasn't really the last request I meant. Could I get another one?"" Well the Indian Chieftain is feeling generous, so he allows the Ranger's request. The ranger whispers into Silver's left ear this time, and Silver runs off to town and comes back, this time with a stunning redhead. The Chieftain chuckles again, ""Alright, sly white man. Take my teepee again. This is a worthy request."" 

So the Lone Ranger spends this last day with the redhead, but in the morning, it's the chopping block again. The Lone Ranger says, ""Look, Chief, I'm not gonna ask for another last request, but could I just have a final word with my horse?"" The Chief allows it, so the Lone ranger grabs Silver by the right ear, grabs her by the left ear, and pulls her head down right in front of his and says ""Silver, read my lips! I *want* a **POSSE!!**"""

Yeah... right...

Whoever built and used that funky little shack in the sky had gone and cut the eyes and vaginas out of every single image of a nude female.

Even the women in the tiny little 16th-of-a-page, black and white, illustrated advertisements for things like dildos and pecker pills.

Every single eye.  Every pussy.

Many of the larger, centerfold images in many of the magazines had the vaginas removed and then had been sewn/stitched close with thread.

There were spools of thread, razors, pens, eyed-needles, markers, etc. everywhere.

I got the fuck out of there and never went back even though it was only about half a mile from my house. I told my dad about it, but he was drunk and acted like, ""meh, kids prolly..."".

11998,"borderline is misunderstood as fuck. it's like having emotional hallucinations. it is impossible to keep a relationship because even if things are going well eventually something that isn't there gets perceived. it is impossible to get help because good intentions are felt as pain. it is impossible to stop emotions from taking over. annoyance is rage, sadness is depression. even the most patient people give up and the thing is that they are always 100% correct because when love is perceived as hate what the fuck is the point? 

borderline is like self aware, self destructive narcissism. as much as i want to be a normal human being that can interact without being a toxic piece of shit, i can't. i have to fight with everybody and i don't know why because it makes me feel like shit. but that's the thing, any way you look at it you're still picking fights and then the next thing you know you're in a deep existential crisis of realizing what a piece of shit you are which ultimately changes nothing. and then you realize you spent that whole time thinking about yourself and doing nothing. which makes you feel worse.

yeah, drug  abuse  is common. i only smoke weed now because if i drank i'd be dead. if i did anything else i'd be dead. i don't know if that would be a bad thing. i've heard it has a 6% suicide rate. i've always figured it was why cobain offed himself. 

i cannot tell you how many relationships i've burned to the ground because i suddenly hated somebody i loved over nothing. people don't realize how much emotion allows you to function. even when i know i'm being crazy i cannot stop because it feels to goddamn real. i once quit a job because i thought the new employee was an undercover boss. do you know how fucking crazy that is? i knew it was but i couldn't not do it because the perceived threat was there. it  was real.

It wants to instill a sense of suspense and fragility of life but doesn't have the balls of better shows (like Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones) to go through with it. There's never any payoff, just teasing. Everyone thought they killed Glenn last season, but no that was a tease. They're teasing us with the whole Neagan ending too. If they followed the comics, or killed someone else important or well liked, I'd be surprised. It will more than likely be one of the supporting characters that was introduced in the last couple of seasons that just got the tiniest bit of development so that you might care just a little when they die, but not too much, who was introduced just for this purpose.

If it goes slow, there's a clear pressure, but it's a bit easier to handle but still kind of hurts.  However, when you learn how to flex in the right way, and what to relax, getting punched becomes easier.  Plus, it gets your adrenaline pumping and puts you into a tunnel vision like head space.  Your endorphins take over and the pain starts to feel good, like when you exercise.

12278,"My dad picked me up from school one day...I think I was in the 10th grade.  We got onto the interstate and after a few miles, this car comes flying by us.  

We move into the other lane so we can exit the interstate onto another loop.  This exit goes off the interstate and onto an overpass curve.  You really do have to slow down while exiting.  There are signs around, but most don't listen.

Anyway, I saw the car exit and turned too wide going up the curve.  It went right over the edge.  We slowed down as we were exiting and pulled over to the side.  My dad and I ran down the embankment to go help.  A couple of other cars that were already on the loop had stopped as well.

The car was upside down and the trunk was wide open.  I remember seeing beer cans all over the ground.  The car was leaking the radiator fluid and water and whatever else they leak from the front.  I remember the smell of it all.

The roof was caved in some and the seats were push up and mangled.  The driver looked dead already.  He didn't appear to have a seat belt on, and he was just limp against the roof.  His passenger, a lady, did have her seatbelt on, but was still pushed forward and in a pretty awkward position upside down.

My dad laid down on the ground and started talking to her.  She was hysterical and he was trying to calm her down.  She couldn't feel anything, but she was conscious and knew she was upside down in a car that flipped over the side railing.  My dad started to rub her head and hold her hand, kind of gently rubbing his thumb on the top of her hand.

I could hear sirens coming...and they arrived shortly after.  They had to go around concrete barriers between the two different lane directions on the loop...so it took them longer to get to the accident.  

When they arrived, they saw the man first and tried to help him.  The firemen came around to the other side and talked to my dad.  He told them he believe she had died maybe 2-3 minutes ago.  He was still rubbing her hand at the time.  

We stayed for a little while for him to answer questions from the police.  The lady had a huge gash in her back from something that came through the seat...which we hadn't noticed before.  I could hear the paramedics saying they could see her spine and it looked like it was severed completely.

That lady dying right there in my dad's hand is one of the most unnerving things I have ever seen.  Cuts and bruises were all over her.  That was pretty brutal.  

It was in the paper a day or two later.  The man had been drinking and they were in some argument. "

12305,"It most definitely is fake. Dogs may aggressively hump people, but to actively fuck? Do people not understand how dogs copulate anyway? They thrust to get in, then the penis swells, and they stand butt to butt, locked together (called being tied). Then, when everything is all finished and the swelling goes down, they walk away. 

Some even panic after swelling happens, or you'll see two walking around trying to separate. They don't really ""get"" what's going on and it does not feel pleasurable. Dogs don't rape humans and don't ""fuck"". It's just not in them. 

Edit: I've worked with dogs for six years, and am currently going to school for veterinarian technology, since apparently having basic knowledge of one of the most common animals is more bizarre than the story of someone claiming a dog CHASED DOWN and raped a human child.

12326,"It wasn't the most gory/disgusting/shocking thing I've ever seen, but to me it was the saddest.

I was walking downtown, and there seemed to be something going on ahead, lots of honking. When I got there I saw a 20-something guy lying down in the middle of the street, blocking the cars. He was crying, obviously in some sort of mental distress.

People kept honking and yelling at him to move. At some point two guys got out of their car, grabbed him and tossed him on the side of the road. When the cars started moving again, the guy on the ground deliberately threw his legs under a car. One ran over his ankle and he screamed.

At this point I heard an ambulance making its way through the traffic. Someone had obviously called 911 before I'd gotten here, and help was finally coming.

That was about 12 years ago and I still think about that guy, how much pain he must have been in to just lie down in the middle of the street and get run over on purpose, and how the drivers kept just swearing at him, how they just fucking *threw* him on the side so they could get to whatever thing was so important they couldn't wait a few more minutes for an ambulance to come."

My fiend and I, the innocent idiot kids we are,  decide it would be funny to hide this guy's bag in the bushes. My friend distracts him and I throw the bag in the bushes. 

About a minute later, the guy starts freaking out. I mean like going insane. Screaming curse words we had never heard at age 9-10, he began frantically and angrily asking where the fuck his bag went. I pointed at my friend, not wanting to take the blame. This guy grabs the shovel we were using to build the jump, and starts swinging it as hard as he can at my friend, missing him by just a couple inches. 

We booked it the fuck out of there on our bikes and never went back there again.

So not one of them wanted to be like, hey remember when we saw a chupacabera? I feel like I wouldn't be able to shut up about it. 

That and the absolute very ending. A slapstick running routine that ends with Kevin getting his balls sliced off (an actually pretty serious and possibly fatal injury) and Taco just saying some quip and that's it. Another 22 minutes down. Couldn't even make the series finale an hour. I retroactively hate the show now and can't bring myself to re-watch KNOWING how it's going to end.

Germans view tap water as poison. They drink bottled water, often with carbonation, and also purify and carbonate their own water. It seems that the view on water in Czech Republic is similar. You may have to beg your waitress for tap water and watch as she judges you while you drink it. 

In Rome people drink out of public fountains running through old aqueducts. It is a beautiful thing to have access to free water shot directly into your mouth through the rock-hard penis of some ancient cherub.

Their behavior is so unique and limited, especially domesticated animals. 

My 130lb. great dane was terrified of my new betta fish. Growling, Chewbacca noises, giving me the side eye, the whole nine yards. He physically put as much of himself in my lap to have me protect him from this itty bitty little fish. 

To him, this thing moving around in this tank of water was the end. It could hurt him, it could hurt me, how could he know? And who did he come to when all of this went down? Me. And it wasn't until I said (or rather showed) that it would be alright that he calmed down. 

Right now he's snuggled up in bed with me, completely ignoring the fish and snoring away. 

I also am studying to be a vet tech, so watching their behaviors while I'm at clinic is also really cool. I don't have as much time to nerd out, unfortunately. 

Ooo and cats! Don't get me started on cats. They're a unique creature of their own.

EDIT: I just want to add in since this comment has gotten so popular: if you notice any seriously abnormal behaviors in your pet, please take them to their veterinarian ASAP. I'm talking going from 100% ""I want to love and cuddle on my human because they're just the best"" to ""I just want to lay here, I don't feel good."" Urinating/pooping in the house, etc. Major changes in behavior could be an indication of a serious health problem, or you could just have a crazy pet.

12398,"There was a guy I used to work with that was the epitome of awkward/strange:

-	On his *first* day, the general manager (his boss’s boss) mentioned that if he has any insurance questions he should speak to Hulk (that’s just what we called the guy, it obviously wasn’t his name) and “The Dwight” responded with *”What? I don’t see any angry green men around here?”* and the GM just kind of smirked and pointed to who he meant. So The Dwight proudly continued on with *”Did you know I have the exact same dimensions as superman? And the eyes to match”*
This guy *was not* built like Superman, not one bit. I mean he was geeky and had dark hair, but not built like Superman.

-	One of the guys mentioned he was picking up a new phone after work and already knew which one he was getting. The Dwight ruthlessly hounded him for the whole day with lecture after lecture about why his choice was wrong and printed out comparisons as to why he should be buying a different phone. He went with his initial choice; The Dwight wasn’t happy.

-	We used to have drinks on a Friday afternoon, because free booze, why not? During this time we would often end up debating about the hottest celebrities an comparing lists online. We were looking at and debating the historic list of world’s sexiest man when the topic of Pierce Brosnan came up. This was his chance to intervene with an anecdote about how his great aunt was on a plane with Pierce, and it came up (on the place) that the aunt had the same maiden name as Pierce. He then continued to say, *”So I’m pretty much related to Pierce, you can see the family resemblance”* (despite being a married in aunt, not by blood). Naturally we thought he was joking and laughed, he was not joking.

-	At my going away drinks, I had planned to head across to the pub with a small group of people. Not only did he decide to invite himself, but when we got there he ordered a shot, that he then proceeded to sip on for 30 minutes. WHO SIPS ON A SHOT. It’s called a *shot* for heaven’s sake!

-	We had casual Fridays. Now this meant guys were still expected to wear a collared top, so polos or decorative flannies were generally the go to. But no. Not with this guy. He wore his Superman shirt *every* casual dress day. One fateful casual dress day when they started enforcing the collared rule, The Dwight wore a Superman shirt under his short sleeved button down shirt. Which is, you know, whatever, no one has to see it. The Dwight however decided that he needed to tell someone, *anyone*, about his shirt and the comparisons that could be made. He picked the Managing Partner (we’ll call him MP) of the legal division. As they were casually doing the usual, much-planned-for-the-weekend pleasantries, The Dwight whips open his top three buttons to reveal his much-loved tee and says *”See this button down is just to hide my true identity… Do you have a secret alter ego?”*. The MP was confused no doubt. He just kind of fobbed it off and went on with his day. The MP was a *huge* fan of India Jones (ringtone and everything) but knew very little of Superman.

-	He was really finicky about not being called the shortened version of his name. Which I can’t give examples of because, rules.

-	One of the girls was nicknamed Cat (Her name didn’t even have cat in it, it’s just the nickname she had) and he would just meow at her every time she walked past or was talking to someone in his cubicle. Now, keep in mind, this was a professional services company, not some part-time job working with kids.

-	At a previous job he got reprimanded for “bullying” other staff members when it came to the fruit box. He would spend most of his day watching the fruit box and keeping track of how many people were taking and would then stop people from taking fruit when he felt they had taken more than their share. This resulted in a lot of complaints.

-	One day I was caught on the tram with him on the way to work, both on the tram and at work I was lectured about how the new Fantastic Four was shit. For 45 minutes. Didn’t bother watching the movie as I was concerned that if he found out I would have to listen to all of his stupid points again.

-	He bought a 3-bedroom house (which, you know good on him) but then tore down the supporting wall between the two spare rooms to build an at home gym. Effectively destroying the resale price of the property. It was in what is generally a family oriented suburb.

And so, so many more incidents of just being odd. I’m pretty sure he falls somewhere on the spectrum

When I asked him to stop, he said that if he didn't play during those hours that he'd go back to drinking."

12410,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I first realized when I was about 18 that my sister was the epitome of sociopathic and narcissistic.  She was 14 at the time and got caught cheating at school.  So, I didn't know everything that had happened, but she got sent to a psych facility for observation.

I drove an hour each day for a week to visit her and try to be a good brother.  After a week I was informed that they'd stopped investigating me.  

To my horror, I found out the whole story.  My sister had been pulled in for cheating, and when asked why she hadn't just studied, she told them she couldn't because my dad had been beating her.  So, they pull in child protective services who do a full physical and discover no signs of physical abuse (I now wish my dad had beat her), but that she was 14 and not a virgin.  So, her explanation for that?  Well, her brother's raped her of course.  Two of my brothers were out of the question because they were in foreign countries or too young, but I was left squarely in the crosshairs.

So oblivious to what I've been accused of, I go every day to visit her.  Their observations of me informed that I was 'unlikely' to have done it, so they decided, correctly, that it was all fabricated.

I had never so much as held a girl's hand, let alone kissed one at that point.  15 years later, I still won't be left alone in a room with her under any circumstances and grit my teeth that there is nothing I can do to prevent her from harming the literal dozens of other people she's now leveled similar accusations at either for attention or to get out of difficult situations.

She's a terrible person without any remorse for the damage she does to all around her."

I rely on public transportation to get to and from work. Leaving 10 minutes past the end of my shift doesn't mean I just get home 10 minutes later.

I am making the point that the people near me don't understand why someone would EVER work minimum wage and they don't understand how low it is.

12481,"For me it would be the existence of an advance civilization over 10 thousand years ago.

We find signs of ancient structures around the planet, like the underwater pyramid off Japan - which richly deserves to be investigated, but isn't.

If true, human history will forever change. Our legacy is much older than five thousand years or so. What happened to them? Will it happen to us?

A good example of this is Göbekli Tepe (in Turkey), an entire city was buried. As in deliberately buried, altering the landscape to do so. Why? [shrugs] More so, only a fraction of what's there has been unearth. It's slow and expensive process. Some of the more outside the box archeologists believe this buried metropolis is over 12,000 years old.

In a way this feels like something from Lovecraft. Why would anybody cover up an entire city? *Like it never existed.* Did something bad happen? Bad enough to wipe it from human history. A lot of questions, but no real answers - yet.

The Sphinx shows water erosion around the base. But can't be, it's inland, the desert. Unless at some point in time it wasn't a desert, there was water. But that kind of thing would predate the pyramids. It doesn't fit. Making matters worse it is pretty much agreed on that the Sphinx has had several revisions on it throughout the past thousands of years. So its *real age* is up in the air."

He was thrilled. He had been living with his parents after a nasty divorce, living on frozen dinners. His first wife does NOT cook. (She is very proud that she does NOT cook.) Not I. I was certain I was stepford wife material. 

I noticed he was eating the broccoli casserole with enthusiasm. I mean, he was really shoveling it down! I made a mental note. A success like this could make a home cook's reputation. He bragged about my cooking in front of me several times throughout the week. 

I was so excited! I had stumbled on his favorite food! What luck! I made a new broccoli casserole, and dished it out into servings, each with a piece of chicken. I made homemade frozen dinners! My granny was right. The way to a man's heart *is* through his stomach. 

I started sending him off with his dinners every time he left my house for work. I picked up a second job, and was too tired to drive to see him during his overnight shifts. At least I knew he was well-fed. 

Finally! A day off! I went to see him during his shift, which had a ton of downtime. We were fucking around in the break room. Out of habit more than anything, I popped open the freezer door as he shouted, ""No! Don't!"" It was too late. There they were. All my precious dinners that I worked so hard over, all stacked in their gladware, in neat little rows. Broccoli casserole graveyard. My eyes teared. I was not a stepford wife after all. 

I slowly turned to my man, who blurted out, ""Gosh, you look good. You're very, very cute."" That was enough to ease the tension. We both laughed- I cried a little bit.

Keith was/is a manager at this hell hole, and likes to crack down on anyone for anything. One day Keith is publicly humiliating a cigarette smoker for something and this guy Brian (who knew Keith from high school) jumps in to say ""he didn't steal your lunch money [Keith]!"" Big laughs all around and that's all anyone can remember about Keith for a long time, even after Brian  himself has moved on to a new job. 

In case you don't get it, Keith was picked on and bullied in high school and he carries this shitty attitude with him everyday, fantasizing about getting revenge on his high school bullies as he exercises his meager authority as a call center manager in ridiculous and draconian ways.

A year later some other random person quits, and as Keith tries to take authority and ""escort"" this guy out of the building, that man shakes off Keith's grip and yells ""I didn't take your lunch money Keith!"""

Now every time you accidentally touch something with your finger it just feels kind of nice, so you pet it a little bit and that feels nice, feels right. You're distracted anyway from this weird finger situation you have going on so you rub your finger until it really feels like it's going to explode only now you're kind of like ""yeah, I'm gonna explode the shit out of this finger"" Suddenly all the pressure that's been building up is released and you become mentally retarded for about 2 seconds. Once your brain begins working again you think, ""that was pretty fucking weird, whew"" The swelling goes down and you forget all about your weird finger until the swelling returns and if it doesn't return you start getting worried.

When I was in 7th grade living in Richmond Virginia, I was best friends with a guy whose parents ran a dental clinic way way out in bum-fuck Va. They lived in Richmond but had a small house with a ton of land out near the practice where one parent would stay and work while the other looked after the household in Richmond, switching every week. My friend and I loved going out there on weekends; the land was beautiful and super explorable.
It was a beautiful fall day, and we had been having the time of our lives riding dirtbikes through miles of trails through his woods before deciding to hop off the bikes and walk deeper off the beaten path. We walked straight into the woods for quite a while, probably several miles into woods that certainly nobody had walked through for quite a time. We all know the eerie feeling that can occur when you’re deep in the woods. Things seem kind of quiet, and you feel a presence. We had stopped talking and I think we both felt it when we came across a wooden... structure. It was clearly a dwelling, and clearly hadn’t been lived in for decades upon decades. It was very well built, seriously it looked like it was built in an almost frontier style but it was still very much standing.
Thats when it happened. The deep silence was pierced with something I can only describe as a banshee scream. It came from each direction at once and physically hurt our ears. We turned and ran. As we ran, we hear the entire building behind us collapse in grand fashion, the scream is now supplemented with splintering wood being torn apart and falling to the ground. We never looked back as we ran.
Being a 13 year old boy, I was much braver than my current 21 year old edition. We ran for a while, caught our breath, and IMMEDIATELY WENT BACK. I seriously can’t even imagine having those brass balls today. I don’t know what we were expecting to find but it certainly wasn’t what we did. There it was. Perfectly untouched. The building we had heard make a sound like a freight train as it collapsed behind us was sitting just as it was when we first found it, untouched by time. We entered.
There were dirt floors, and some old handmade furniture, like chairs and a chest of drawers. Those were the immediate sights. We walked through a doorway and were greeted with the sight of what I can only describe as piles of rotting, ripped bloodstained clothing, and three nooses hanging over a beam in the ceiling. We ran almost as fast as we had the first time, wordlessly, all the way back to the dirt bikes, rode home and didn’t sleep a wink that night.
I believe in the supernatural. There is no logical explanation for anything that happened that day."
12649,"a sick table beat.

first, count to 4 in your head, with each count lasting about a half a second. try your best to make sure each number is on time: that is, you're counting in the same time interval.

1 - 2 - 3 - 4

if you play an instrument, or have ever been in any sort of band or choir, this should come easily to you.

there are 2 main sounds that you can make with your fist: the 'knock' and the 'bang'. the 'knock' is made with your knuckles, and the 'bang' is made with the bottom of your fist.

now, count in your head, 1 2 3 4. on the 1 and 3 sound, make a knock with one hand.

easy, right?

now try it again, this time with a bang. 1 and 3, hit the table with your fist.

also easy!

now let's step it up a notch. instead of counting 1 2 3 4, we're gonna count 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and. the space between the numbers should be the same as last time.

try it, in your head.

cool!

try hitting the 'knock' on the 1 and 3, and the 'bang' on the 2 and 4.

good! it's still not a sick beat, but remember the 'ands' we counted earlier? we're going to use those.

now: knock on 1, knock on 2, knock on 3, knock on 3and, and bang on 4.

it should sound like: knock, knock, knock knock, bang.

now it sounds like a beat! let's try something else.

1: knock; 1and: knock; 2: bang; 3: knock; 3and: knock; 4: bang

depending on the speed at which you are counting, this should sound a little bit like 'we will rock you'. simple!

now, for the last part of the 'lesson.

we're now going to count 1 e and a, 2 e and a, 3 e and a, 4 e and a.

remember: the speed of the numbers should be the same. you're basically saying twice as many things in the same time interval, in your head.

let's create our last beat.

1: knock; 2: bang; 3: knock; 3and: knock; 3-a: knock; 4: bang

knock... bang... knock, knock knock bang.

that's what it should sound like.

congrats, you've made a beat that people can freestyle to, in 10 minutes, with only one hand!

now, 10 minutes or so has passed but tune in next time for the lesson that involves using 2 hands!

12668,"It can be totally chill to have cats. However, they really are a commitment. I was sad that I no longer had kitties when I went away to university, so I rescued one. Sixteen years later and many continents, she is still by my side. I often think I could have had a fucking almost fully grown kid considering this amount I've lived with this cat. Thank fuck I don't. 

Instead, I have three more cats that were rescued in their own unique ways. Just rescued the fourth one and it was a really hard decision, but I knew I was the best option for her as a forever home. 

I guess I'm destined to be a crazy cat lady. However, I've made the decision that they go where I go no matter what. It can get expensive, but it is worth it. 

I have to say that people really do need to think about getting a kitten. Are they truly prepared for sixteen+ years of cat? I despise people that get a kitten only to get rid of it once it gets older. "
12669,"No, neck beards are an example of the worst part of nerd culture, that's why Reddit gives them so much stick. I'm a nerd and I've met way too many neck beards in real life. They make me embarrassed to admit I role play or enjoy video games, they make being a nerd gross. Obviously a lot of people who *look* like neck beards aren't really what Reddit means when they use it as an insult, but it's shocking how many people I've met while pursuing my hobbies that are text book neck beards. Rude, condescending, entitled, psychically gross, poor hygiene, etc. 

I'm also embarrassed how often neck beards are the same people espousing racist and sexist views behind a thin layer of pseudo intellectualism. It wouldn't be embarrassing if it was rare, but between Reddit and my own IRL nerdery, it seems like it's pretty hard to avoid neck beards if you get serious about nerdy things. I can't think of a single nerd hobby I have where I haven't ran across them. It makes me a lot more shy about admitting I own 20 sided dice or that I like tinkering with raspberry pis. "

12776,"Here's a few of them from what I consider least to worst:

* In one company, paychecks bounced and intentional cutting of hours from logs. When confronted on it, the owners refused to cover the fees for the bounced checks &amp; since we weren't allowed to keep our own copies of work logs, in/out times, etc., there was no way to prove hours. On top of that, they were stealing people's clothes from employee storage. Got out of there ASAP.

* Worked for a comic store who paid all his employees under the table, who would pay people by how much he felt they deserved for that day, not the amount of hours. Of course there'd be some days he'd have people open to close and he'd state that they didn't deserve a dime for that day. I stayed less than a week. Nobody was upset when he closed.

* Worked at a place with multiple OSHA violations. Lots of somewhat unsafe situations. Those who would point out the lack of safety were reprimanded, including me - they shouldn't post signs on who to report safety issues to if they didn't want people to use them! Nobody was surprised when they got busted for multiple labor violations. All of those who had complained about it at all in the past were fired, including me.

* I was the only employee in my department who had English as their first language. Some had very thick accents or they only spoke limited English. The department staff had lots of complaints with the newest manager, but the manager was horrendous at making out accents and would only try to listen to them for a few moments before giving up. I could understand them all and told them I'd be happy to get all of the complaints together and then talk to the manager for them. I tried to talk to the manager about the issues on multiple occasions, but she refused to even talk to me. I told the  staff this, and they let me know that the owner was showing up in a few days. I told them that I would try contacting the owner directly and also bring up the issue that the manager would outright refuse to talk to me. The day the owner was to show up in the afternoon, the manager pulled me aside and told me that I was fired. I asked on what grounds, and was told I violated a rule - a particular light in a certain room had to be on at all times. Of course that rule was never posted in any of the manuals we had, any signs put up, nobody ever brought up this law, etc., and as far as the manager was concerned, I was the sole violator of this rule. I pointed out that the manager also violated this rule and there was nothing anywhere in the company showing this rule. I was told that didn't matter, had my final paycheck cut and escorted out of the building by security. I talked to some of the staff some time later, and was told that a few of them were pressured by the manager to find something to ding me on. They didn't realize that it was to get me canned. According to another manager there, I was booted for two reasons: The manager I was dealing with was already on thin ice, so they were trying to save their job and also that there was fear of a union starting to pop up because I was coming with problems on behalf of the entire department."

Not only was it my first wedding with this church, but it was also my first time playing the organ (the instrument).  No time to practice as it was a last minute request.  The day of the wedding, the bride had a bridezilla moment and asked if I could play ""Here Comes the Bride""... Um sure I said without thinking.  I think I remember how it goes.

What the church didn't tell me was that the processional was going to take five minutes.  All I could remember was the first five bars of the march.  It was so painful.  I winced.  And then went home and cried.  Luckily, it was a small wedding.  11 years later, the church hasn't fired me yet.  I have tons of stories of weddings, funerals, special services and concerts.  Eventually, they did start to get easier.  I refuse to play Here Comes the Bride at weddings.  It's my bad luck song.

12817,"I was young, maybe 8. Just so you know, I *always* go to sleep in my bed and I'd never, ever fall asleep on the couch. My grandpa died and we got back from his funeral. That night I went to bed, in my room as usual, but i woke up in the middle of the night on the living room couch. When I looked up, I saw my grandpa's ghost. It wasn't scary or anything, at the time it felt natural. He didn't say anything but there was this understanding between us. I went back to my room and went back to sleep.

I would've assumed it was a dream but it was so vivid and *real* that it stuck with me for years (especially since I woke up on the couch, which made the moment stick out even more in my mind). It wasn't even a ""I saw a ghost!"" moment... It was just a weird vivid memory that seemed so normal at the time that I didn't think anything strange of it. When i was about twenty I told my mom that story and she said ""was it the day of his funeral? Because I saw his ghost that night too."" That fucked my shit up.

12818,"&gt; For example, if you're a freshman in college don't worry about getting a job after graduation. 

Sweet mother of god. If you are in college the whole point is to land a job afterward. Don't *obsess* about getting a job every day, but make sure you have your fucks in a row so you can find one.

* Understand the job market for your major. 
* Get (PAID) internships and co-ops during the summer or a semester. 
* Try to get above a 3.0 GPA average for your whole career. 
* Pick major classes in a field you enjoy and if you find that field, chain them to specialize. 
* Get a double major or post-grad degree if you can swing it. 
* Go to your college's or towns career fairs (especially the major specific ones like Engineering) and talk to as many people as you can. You need to get an idea what the job market is like. Hand our resumes if they are accepting them or apply at their websites. 
* Start looking for employment during your final semester. Having a job lined up for graduation is killer; means you don't have to have that fast food on your resume for 6mo b/t graduation and landing your first gig.
* Join and participate in clubs at your school that interest you. *Especially* if they are related to your field of study. Robotics for  Mech/Electrical Engineering for instance.

12868,"Figure out more about how willpower works.  Reading the following shouldn't take 10 minutes and will likely improve your understanding of how to effectively use willpower to promote habit or worldview change.  

When you're faced with a familiar cue, barring effort and the expenditure of willpower you'll fall into whatever feels right.  What feels right is going to be your old familiar roles.  Even if they don't lead to the ends you want, it will seem right at the time.  Now, I mentioned willpower, it is a limited resource.  Willpower is in ways like a pool which refills over time, in ways like a muscle.  You can use up your pool and when you've got nothing left to spend you'll return to your old habits reinforcing them anew.  That's why it's important to focus your efforts for habit change on just one thing.  Keep that up until that thing itself is habit, then when you're out of willpower you'll revert to your new default rather than your old.  You will occasionally slip into the old along the way, but it will become less and less, and sometime you'll find you're completely drained but just feel like doing the new way, that's when you know you're getting ready.  Change just one thing, wait until that thing is habit, then change just one more.  

There are basically two main methods of using your willpower, the first is to face down your cues, the second to avoid them.  There are advantages and disadvantages to each.  Facing them down is expensive, but if you're able to do it, it's one of the fastest ways to train yourself into a new habit.  You also occasionally have no choice but to face those cues, and if you reengage the old habits you'll reinforce them again so it's sometimes the only option.  That brings us to avoidance, sometimes it's simply not an option.  That's one of its downsides.  Now, the ruts of habit you've worn into yourself will atrophy with time so avoidance can help even once you re-expose yourself to those situations, but it's a slower process.  On the other hand some situations cue you on a behavior very frequently.  If you have to use willpower constantly to stop from some behavior it will drain your pool too rapidly and you'll end up caving sooner or later.  Maybe not even in that situation, but sometime your pool will be used up and you'll slip.  This is why, for example, an alcoholic should avoid bars.  It's an avoidable situation and there are a bunch of environmental cues that make them know just what to do... take a drink, even though they know where that path leads, it's just so worn into who they are it's expensive to fight it.  Figure out what your cues are, figure out if it's a battle you should skip or one you need to fight.  

From here it gets a bit easier because as I mentioned earlier willpower is like a muscle.  The more you work it, the bigger your pool becomes and the faster it refills.  Just keep changing one thing and working out that muscle and you'll become better and faster at making behavioral change occur.  

I feel compelled to mention at this point an important caveat; you need to understand that because you should only be working on one major habit change at a time that the rest will have to wait. While I was working on one change I would notice that I did not live up to my ideal in other areas of my life. This in itself was cue for beating myself up. But I would remind myself that I was doing all that I could to get myself out of the situation that I was in. And that's all you can do. You can't expect more of yourself. I'd remind myself when I fell into other roles that I wasn't actively working to fix, it wasn't me the failure, the fallen. Once you're on the ground the best thing you can possibly do is pick yourself back up. As long as I was working toward that, I was doing the best I possibly could. Perfection isn't possible, progress is. 

So, that's how I broke my cycles through understanding willpower. I changed one thing and accepted that while it may not be the only thing I wanted to change that I was doing the best I possibly could by making progress. "

12870,"The deterioration of the Bee population.

Ocean Acidification.

Methane equilibrium in the atmosphere.

These three are the hugest problems for humanities long term survival on earth.  Bees are the number one pollinator for just about all plant life.  If they go so do a lot of plants that rely on them to reproduce. 

Ocean Acidification is the least talked about everywhere I look.  It's one of the problems directly responsible for the death of simple ocean life.  Big photosynthesizers are being inhibited by this.  Throwing the ecosystem off balance.  (Don't forget about coral reefs!)

Methane is a huge (if not the largest) contributor to green house gases.  In the past it maintained itself by being broken down via radiation in the upper atmosphere.  If I remember correctly each ""batch"" would last 7 years until it was broken down.  With the live stock and natural leakage we have now, it's becoming exponentially worse. Carbon Dioxides and CFCs can take a back seat to this bad boy.

12872,"Everything you have here I 100% agree with! Mindfulness is so important, especially for those who have a tendency to overtime and ruminate.  

BUT, I also want to say, it's definitely not ""easy"". It's a simple concept, definitely, but truly being able to suspend judgement of your thoughts, your actions, and the world around you is literally against human nature. I worry that many people are interested in practicing mindfulness, but get discouraged because it seems so simple and people say ""Just do it"" the same way one tells a depressed person to ""Just stop thinking that way"".  

For people who want to practice mindfulness, it's a funny thing. You try to suspend judgement, then you find yourself judging. Then you get upset at yourself for judging when the mindful approach is to acknowledge that you didn't suspend judgement and continue trying to do so. Don't give up, though! Eventually, you will berate yourself for a shorter amount of time. You might still get upset at yourself, but it won't take you so far down the rabbit hole. That is improvement! "

1. Send in a résumé.
2. Ace the interview.
3. Show up to work.

In actuality, the entire thing goes a little more like this:

1. Dig through several dozen websites in search of positions.
2. Spend hours researching the companies, writing cover letters, and editing résumés.
3. Fill out the same goddamned application page for every position.
4. Wonder why the hell you even bothered uploading your résumé if they were going to make you type everything in again.
5. Submit your application.
6. Hear absolutely nothing in response.
7. Exhaust all available options.
8. Attempt to network with individuals who might be able to help or offer advice.
9. Learn from these individuals that the job you want is almost never filled via an application process.
10. Consider stalking the person who might be able to hire you.
11. You could learn their routine, ""accidentally"" meet them one day, and then say *just the right thing*.
12. You could also get arrested, so maybe that's not a good idea.
13. Ask other industry experts for their advice.
14. Eventually - if you're *extremely* lucky - get offered the chance to interview for a position that's a few steps away from the one you want.
15. Ace the interview.
16. Hear absolutely nothing for a week.
17. Send a follow-up email.
18. Receive word that the project has been cancelled, and the person who interviewed you is being investigated for racketeering.
19. What the hell is racketeering?

12929,"I'm not a doctor or nurse, but I am a vascular ultrasound tech. And it's finally time to share my story. 

I had just gotten to work in the morning, and I wasn't feeling my best. Just kind of nauseous. I was waiting for my patient to arrive, but he was late. I was hoping that he would not show up, since I felt shitty and this particular exam was 2 hours long. It was about 40 minutes past his exam time and I thought to myself, ""He's not coming. The gods are smiling down on me today."" And then I got the call that he had arrived. 

I walk into the waiting room to bring him back to my office. There are three men waiting. Two average sized, clean looking men, and one morbidly obese, filthy man in a wheelchair. Guess which one was my patient? 

I wheel him back to my room. I can already smell the filth on the way back. Nausea increasing. When we get back to the room, I tell him to remove his shirt (I was scanning his arms and hands). He hands me his shirt. The shirt was supposed to be white, and I can safely say that white was only showing on 25% of it. The rest was covered in stains of all colors. It looked and felt like he had been wearing it for a month. I placed it on the coat hook, and it literally went through the shirt because it was also full of holes. Convenient. 

As I begin the exam, he says loudly, ""I had horrible diarrhea last night!"" Not sure why he told me, but I took it as a warning. I began his exam, trying not to pay attention to the smells violating my nose. When I was half way done, he asks me if there is a bathroom nearby. Now, there is a bathroom in my office that patients sometimes use and that I use as well. I didn't want him to use it, but I more so didn't want him to shit all over himself. So I told him where it was. He sits up on the bed, and I look down and see three things. One, brown stains on the sheet. Two, blood on the sheet. From an unknown source. And three, some sort of black bug run out from under him. I just stared for a minute and wondered if this was my life. I smashed the bug into the sheet, the patient didn't even notice. Or if he did, he was unphased. 

He gets up to use the bathroom (he could walk, just very slowly). As he's walking, I noticed brown flakes falling all over the floor. Shit flakes, I guessed. Cool. So he's in the bathroom for 10 or 15 minutes and I'm waiting. Waiting. Finally I hear the toilet flush twice. Then, for less than a millisecond, the sink turns on and off. He may have gotten one drop of water on his hands, if he was lucky. 

So he comes back out with his dirty hands for me to scan, and I finish the exam. Afterwards, as I'm sterilizing the entire room, one of my coworkers goes to use the bathroom. I hadn't got to the bathroom yet. 

He peeks his head out and asks if the patient used this bathroom. I said yes, and I was already reaching for the sanitizing wipes before he asked for some. I don't know the full horror of what was there, but I do know the horrors that my coworker failed to clean up. Shit flakes on the floor (obviously) and my personal favorite, smeared shit across the door. Yep.

He'd come home from a stint of homelessness and very kindly say ""wow, cool headphones,"" and two nights later after all the promises to turn his life around, he'd be gone, and so would my headphones. His sincere compliments became a pretty clear indicator of what he would steal later, and so we'd all hide whatever he admired. It's almost like he himself had no idea that he was going to rob us until it was happening. 


He physically abused the whole family, and we basically understood that he was a piece of shit. Maybe one with poor social skills, maybe one who was incredibly self-centered, maybe one with no empathy, but to get a real answer he would have had to see a professional, which he was unwilling to do.  


He was arrested for threatening to stab a homeless man. There was no evidence, no case, but my dad was going to get him a lawyer anyways, out of guilt for never being able to afford one for all his prior arrests. The case was dropped, thankfully, and as soon as he was released he gleefully told us all in the car that the charges had all been accurate. He was proud of himself. I think that's when it hit my dad. For me, it was when he literally hit my dad, repeatedly, with a phone, for trying to call the police. My dad refused to retaliate, just sat there sobbing. "

Then, she got back INTO the coop and looked at Digsy with that little side eye thing chickens do until Digsy tried it herself, then followed her out into the yard. I let them have that one, and until dad patched the hole a week later I only saw Tipsy and Digsy out in the yard, not the other two. "

In the wake of the Kennedy assassination the CIA sent out [document 1035-960](http://www.jfklancer.com/CIA.html) which basically was an early guide to undermining legitimate people trying to point out corrupt conspiracies (history is littered with them) and tie them in with crazy conspiracy theorists. They basically used their contacts in the news and media to undermine those that questioned the official narrative of the warren commission.


Conspiracy theory wasn't always a pejorative. It was just questioning an official narrative and questioning if the government is fucking you.

Exaggerate and distort the truth where it gets too crazy to believe and you can then group legit people trying to overturn a conspiracy with people who are loony and paint them all with the same brush.

A lot of people think that reptilian stuff was one of those types of theories, because when you actually look at things like bohemian grove and the bilderberg group you'd probably form the conclusion that very powerful world elites are working together to push a mutually beneficial agenda. Add in lizard aliens and now you can ridicule someone trying to point out legitimate behind the scenes corruption and undermine him in the eyes of the people.

Look at chemtrails. This is an example of exaggerating the truth so much that people don't believe something that is a fact. The government 100% WITHOUT A DOUBT did drop chemicals onto civilians in the 1950s during operation LAC for secret chemical and biological tests that spanned over half a dozen states using chemtrails. If you exaggerate it to an extreme degree, then people trying to point out that the government has dropped chemtrails onto civilians multiple times are grouped together with crazy idiots who think every goddamn contrail is a chemtrail."

My dad said ""no fucking way"" and we had a proper funeral/burial (BTW-They were never married). When it came time to lower her ashes into the plot, my 90 yr old grandma picked her ashes up off of the lowering deck and tried to run away with them and began shaking her urn up and down while screaming (this is at a fucking cemetery). It took four family members to get the urn out of her hands and put it back down so they service could continue. Thankfully, her cremains were in a sealed bag, because she definitely would have spilled. This was supposed to be a mournful moment and my grandma turned it into something about her.

There's plently good in being meek.

You are to but three rules confined.

This also touches on relativity and quantum mechanics. The idea that when you reach toward an object, what's really happening is that your hand is entering an area where the *probability* of it encountering that object's atoms quickly jumps from almost zero to almost one.

Before you hit the downvote, at least hear me out.  For the last 20 years, I've hated the Republican party (still do), because I couldn't stand how they insisted on pushing their personal morals onto everyone else, rather than just letting everyone live their lives.  You couldn't be gay because they didn't like it.  You couldn't have an abortion because they thought it was wrong.

It's only recently that I've realized that the left is just as bad about the same thing, only with more palatable morals.  But the end result is the same.  ""You need to live the way WE think you should live.""  You need government-run health care because we think it's better for you.  You need to wear a helmet riding your motorcycle because you're too stupid to make that call for yourself.  You can't be a prostitute because we think you're being abused.  

So I don't mean to say that the GOP isn't bullshit, too, but it's only recently that I realized they aren't alone."

13109,"Caution; very, _very_ sad story. But with a semi-happy ending.

This actually happened. My cat, Aphrodite, had just given birth to an almost all white cat, with a black mask. Single cat birth, not a litter. Aphrodite, being the runt of her litter, also gave birth to a tiny little thing. It was _so_ fucking small, we didn't think it would survive the night. But it did, and the fucker pulled through.

It liked the fridge alot for some reason, always tried to get in it as soon as we opened it. 

One day, my sister was rummaging around in the fridge. Unbeknownst to her, the little cat hopped in to look around. She let the door close on it's own, full swing. It caught the cat's head, and almost killed it. It was limp for the rest of the night, but I'll be a son of a bitch if it didn't pull through that fucking injury. My sister was bawling, I was pissed at her (My anger was uncalled for, I know) and everyone was just generally shaken up from the situation. 

We took it to a vet a couple days later, and they told us there's a very, _VERY_ high chance it has brain damage. After about a month of carefully watching him, making sure he was doing okay, it was confirmed that he was, indeed, brain damaged. He was legitimately mentally retarded. He still ate, drank, and did his business, though, not in the litter box. He was just our mentally-fucked little kitty cat. 

about a year later, (yes, he lived for a year after the accident) he passed away in his sleep. Mostly because his brain injury stunted his growth to a halt. By the time he passed, he should've been full grown, but he was no larger than a grapefruit.

Just remember, if your cat likes the fridge, always, _always_ check before you close. Just in case."

1. Sounds that don't really exist anymore but are still used such as rewinding of a video 

2. All animals make noise (even when their mouth is closed)

3. Pressing buttons on a cell phone or any electronic device, 

4. Sound of car tires screeching/squealing when they are moving normal speed.

5. Can always hear actors' voices clearly despite the environment (Mad max, Great Gatsby)


Other:

1. Rain is always extremely heavy (because cameras can not pick up light rain)

2. Streets at night are almost always wet (for aesthetic purposes)

3. Car chases, and many more impractical stunts

4. Gorgeous women populating very intellectual/tech/crime industries.

5. In professional productions, no walls are ever white, and they all have texture/dimension.

6. In fact, no clothes are ever white- they are actually gray-washed since white overexposes on screen.

7. Eye-color of the main character is almost always exaggerated severely (through color-grading).

8. Lack of mentally/physically disabled representation (minus breaking bad)

9. When people walk- take notice of how SLOW they are walking.



Fun fact: There's a rule in sound design that states ""see a dog, hear a dog."" This means, if something is on screen, put in a sound for it. This cues the audience subconsciously to take note of that important part of the films (hence swords and guns always make sounds). It is to add ""color"" to a scene. Film is art, and art is about conveying a message. Sometimes we use symbolism (or ""convention"") to play up an emotion. Sound is very subconscious and without certain sounds, scenes feel ""empty"". In fact sometimes adding a sound to non-sound things creates the effect of realism, which is an interesting concept itself. 

Fun fact: Certain symbols are used throughout the film industry. Such as the [Wilhelm scream] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdbYsoEasio), which is a particular kind of scream that is used over and over as an homage to sound recording.  

Another is the [A113] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eh1trIMD7Y) used in Disney movies, which is the room # of an animation class at Cal Arts that many people who work at Disney attended.

13207,"The Grail Movement cult, with the Mauerova sister's canibalistic torture of their sons, and the creepy Barbora Skrlova.  Ugh, probably the deepest rabbit hole I've gone chasing on the internet.  And I still don't understand all of it. 

So in the Czech Republic, 2007, a father sets up a baby monitor to check on his newborn.  But when he turns it on, instead of seeing his own baby asleep in his crib, he instead sees an image of a 8 year old boy, naked, tied-up, in a corner of a dirty cellar.   He calls the cops.  The cops realize the guy has accidentally gotten a signal from the same baby monitor in a nearby house, so they go door-to-door to figure out where it is.  They find the Mauerova sisters. 

The Mauerova's are two adult sisters who live together.  The older sister is a single mom of two young boys.  She has also recently adopted a 13-year-old girl named Anna.  It's her boys that are tied up in a cellar being tortured.  It's her boys that have had skin peeled off their body, fried in a pan, and served to their mother and aunt.

Turns out they are part of a cult and that is why they are abusing the boys.  Initially, the cops think the girl Anna is being abused too, but she doesn't have any of the same burns, bruises, or scars, and the boys (who heart-breakingly keep insisting that they *deserve* the ""punishment"" the adults gave them because they were ""bad"") confirm that the girl isn't ever touched.  And that, in fact, the abuse didn't start until after she came to live with them, and that she typically is included in dishing out the punishments to the boys.  

And then you find out that 13-year-old Anna, is actually 33-year-old Barbora Skrlova.  We find that out when she runs away to another country and shaves her head to pose as a 14-year-old boy.  Fortunately she is caught and dragged back to face prosecution.

And she is the daughter of the cult leader, who is apparently trying to set her up to be worshiped as a saint? a Savior?  I don't actually know.  They claim they're part of the Grail Movement, but the rest of the Grail Movement insists they are outsiders who aren't part of that religion.

This was easy for the previous generation, whose parents lived during the great depression and wars; they just had to go to college, get a job, buy a house, and start a family to achieve ""the American Dream"", and it was reasonable that someone in their 20s could do all that. For the current generation, it's practically impossible to achieve any of that in the same time frame due to student loans and a ridiculously competitive job market. Not to mention that the goals now are not just to be in a field, but everyone wants to ""make it big"" in their respective fields, which realistically not *everyone* can do.

 They have a policy that we caregivers aren't allowed to give medication to patients unless the doctor faxes over a copy of the original prescription (fair enough, healthcare is a scary business when working with hospice and distressed family members). 

The client I had was diabetic, had COPD, and a mess of other problems resulting in a lot of medication to give. A few weeks before she passed away, her doctor prescribed a really important anitbiotic to nip an incessant infection in the bud. It was affecting all of these problems (low blood sugar, inablility to stand, inablility to sleep). Unfortunately this doctor didn't fax the prescription (was on vacation?) which resulted in her not receiving this antibiotic for over a week.

Long story short my client ended up in the hospital, which wasn't rare for her, but never came out. All because we caregivers couldn't give the antibiotic she needed in time to kill this infection.

Not super fucked up, I've dealt with more awful things from family members. However, it breaks my heart that we could have done something more and were stopped by a policy and the threat of losing our job/ license. They didn't do anything illegal but it still sucks to think that this could happen to other clients when the family isn't around to oversee the care."

13450,"I hire for entry-level positions in a field related to politics in the US. I'm not sure how useful my perspective is in other fields, but here it goes:

* POOR FORMATTING. Please demonstrate that you can present information in a way that is easy to follow and somewhat aesthetically pleasing. You don't have to go crazy with color or fancy layouts like you're applying for a graphic design job or something, but everything should be neat and consistent. Use a nice, conservative font. Use the entire page to arrange the information in a way your reader can follow easily. Please keep yourself to one page. You'll have plenty of time for the multi-page resume when you're older. 

* SPELLING AND PUNCTUATION. In this particular field, you are basically selling your ability to write. If you can't be bothered to proofread or use proper grammar, why should I think you can do this job? I'll let it go if it's something small that your asshole brain might gloss over and standard spellcheck/document search precautions wouldn't pick up (so be sure to search for public vs. pubic, form vs. from, etc.), but consistent or egregious errors send a resume directly to the circular file. Outright spelling errors are inexcusable; they are fucking underlined on every word processing program I've ever seen.

* IRRELEVANT INFORMATION. I understand some people were not able to have their parents secure cushy internships for them, so this does NOT mean that you should not list your service jobs or whatever job you held in school to get by. That kind of experience shows character and grit in my book, even though it it may not constitute direct ""relevant experience"" in this field. I will offer an example for this one: One kid listed several flashy and prominent internships on his resume, and under each, as a bullet point where one would normally describe their job functions and experience, he wrote, ""Worked in the [Name of Office Building] of [Name of Organization He Worked For]."" I shit you not, this kid thought that indicating that he worked in the building where his internship was located constituted something that he should list on his resume. Don't do that. Or anything like it. Also, I don't care that you know how to use Microsoft Word. Please don't list your knowledge of Microsoft Office Suite on your resume. At this point, it's basically up there with bragging that you know how to read -- and most people are not nearly as good with Excel as they say they are. 

* SHITTY COVER LETTERS. Personally, I barely look at cover letters and am much more concerned with the separate writing sample I usually request. That said, I use them to assess three things: 1) Can the applicant write coherently? 2) Does the applicant know how to format a formal business letter? 3) Has the applicant done any homework on the firm at all? My bar is pretty low, and still people fuck it up. I have seen cover letters with no formal salutation that started with the word ""Hi."" I have seen letters that addressed me as ""Dear [Company Name]"" or as ""Mrs. Livejumbo"" (pro tip: just use ""Ms."" in professional correspondence with a woman if you don't know her marital status or preference). I have seen letters that did not reference my firm at all. This is to say nothing of the letters I get that are riddled with typos and spelling errors. Again, my standards are similar to a resume: good grammar, no major or consistent typos, neat formatting, professional language, and relevant information. 

Basically, all of my red flags come down to an applicant's ability to communicate in written form. A lot of the work in my industry centers on one's ability to communicate well through writing, and if an applicant can't do that, then they are simply not cut out for the field."
13451,Why do people insist on pointing possibly loaded weapons at *other* people? It would demonstrate a lot more confidence if they pointed it at their own head.
13452,"I've always liked the practice of giving a separate award for someone who has stood out in some positive way, while leaving the main award for the top-performing person. 

When I was in high school, my cross country team had two end of season awards: an ""MVP""-type award for the runner with the best meet scores, and a ""Captain's choice"" award for the runner who caught people's attention for another reason. I won the Captain's choice award my first year because I was an embarrassingly terrible runner at the start, but I worked hard and improved my 5k time by 10 minutes over the course of the season. By the end of the season I was running in the varsity races, but I still wasn't one of the best few runners on the team. So I appreciated the recognition for my hard work and improvement, but I'm glad there were two awards, so that I didn't feel guilty winning an award in place of one of the better runners who excelled all season.

For whatever reason it hit me right in the fucking soul. I changed. I kept playing sports with the ""jock"" appearance, but I dropped the ego and my associations with the terrible people I hung around with. I found out how much I had in common with the people I used to pick on and how good and truly genuine people they are. I started defending anyone who couldn't defend themselves and was suspended multiple times. Very worth it. My life is much better 10 years later. I have a great job and great relationships and still have my ""nerd"" friends I drink and play video games with! Bullies are cowards, I hope anyone with a bully problem can find the courage and strength  inside them to take a stand against them.

Regular masking tape sticks much stronger and can discolor paper or leave sticky residue behind -- so imagine you've just spent 50 hours on a drawing (not an unusual amount of time), and you've either framed the piece in masking tape to create a clean border or taped the piece down to a flat surface during the work process (very common practices in drawings/watercolors/drafting). Now you wanna take the tape off but you end up ripping a part of your drawing despite your best efforts to do so carefully, or now you've succeeded in slowly peeling off the tape, but there's a nasty yellow border surrounding the drawing where there should be a crisp white one. You can't fix any of that shit, and that's 50 hours of work down the drain.

13579,"Alright, so.  My family is by and far all very conservative and very Republican, they're all also gigantic assholes and a little less than well versed on the subject of ""research"".  Here's a few things they believe. 

1. Obama is the antichrist.  This is based on his name, entirely. 
2. He isn't American. 
3. That he was sworn in on the Quran. 

And this one is my personal favorite, 

4. That because of his leniency towards Muslims (and by leniency I mean the fact that he doesn't just bomb the entire middle east), we no longer teach children cursive writing.  I have no idea how they correlate any of those thoughts. 

Its really shitty too, because you can't reason with them, or provide any actual evidence that puts Obama in any sort of good light.  Everything you say is immediately discounted because you're an ""Obama lover"" and or ""a Kool-aid drinker"" (actual things my aunt said to me after I said that it's just a LIIIITTLE racist to call him and his wife monkeys, but fuck me, right?)

Edit.  Because I have more. 

1. They firmly believe Obama has spent most of his presidency on vacation. 
2. They think he's personally funded and supported the riots in Baltimore. 
3. They think he's catapulted the country into irreparable debt and has skyrocketed the unemployment rate. 
4. They think he's a socialist. 
5. As well as supporting riots, they think he's leading an African American ""uprising"". 
6. They hold Obama responsible for the fact that my cousin, who's a felon and on a sex offender list, can't legally purchase a weapon.   Apparently they think is some unjust policy that Obama alone put into place, you know, BACKGROUND CHECKS. 
7. They thought he was going to override the policy for maximum terms and run for a 3rd term as president.
8. They believe he got rid of the GI Bill because said felon cousin can't go to college because most universities won't let felons or anyone on a list on campus.  (the gi bill is still in place.)

There's more, but that's just off the top of my head.  I avoid most of my family at all costs. "
13580,Suicide
13581,"It is called large, not wide!"
13582,"Llamas. People need to know more about how awesome llamas are. Here are some quick reasons why, though I could go on for days.
Llama wool is finer, warmer, and more valuable than sheep wool. It is also said to be hypoallergenic and contains no lanolin.
Llamas are grazers AND browsers, meaning they eat grass, leaves, bushes – anything green! You can own two llamas happily on a single half-acre of good Bermuda grass.
Llamas eat only 1/3 the amount of grass or hay as compared to horses or donkeys of the same size. They can carry 1/3 of their weight in a pack, making them more efficient packing animals than any other.
Llamas can adapt to most any climate. Their modified blood allows them to be breathe easily at very high altitude, the long fur keeps them warm in cold weather, and they can tolerate high heat if shaved.
Llamas reduce herd loss. Their most common job in the US is as guardian animals for sheep, goats, and other herds. They chase away predators as large as mountain lions and significantly reduce herd deaths from predation.
Llama manure, called “Llama Beans,” is one of the best fertilizers in the world. It does not “burn” plants, it is high in nitrogen and potassium, and its unique dry bean shape is not originally moist or messy to the touch while still readily absorbing and locking in moisture when watered.
Llamas leave pastures better than they found them. They specifically eat out weeds and low bushes or branches before the better grasses, allowing for more and better grass to grow for other livestock.
Llama herds are very clean and poop in a communal pile, usually at the same time. If you want the location of this pile to change, you need only clean up the pile and put some of the poop where you DO want it to be. The llamas instinctively go to that location from then on.
Because of their unique poop habits, llamas are naturally house trained and can be taken anywhere including indoors for up to two hours before needing to relieve themselves. They will NOT poop anywhere but their herd piles unless under extreme duress.
Llama spitting is a dominance behavior usually only between male llamas. Any well trained llama that was raised properly and not abused will know to never spit at a human, because humans are not other llamas to fight with.
Llamas (and other camelids) are nearly silent. They hum when upset and only make louder noises as an alarm that they are under attack from a predator or while mating.
Llamas are “induced ovulators” like rabbits. They can breed at any time of year and the females become fertile only after breeding. They have no period – if your female is bleeding, she needs a vet!
Llama gestation is exactly 11 and 1/2 months and they can rebreed after two weeks, meaning llamas almost always have exactly one cria (baby) a year on nearly the same day every year.
With the exception of in-tact adult males, llamas have no upper front teeth and cannot bite. Males grow “fighting teeth” to defend with, but these are only canine teeth that are usually clipped and removed once grown in for safety.
There is no such thing as a “wild” llama. Llamas were bred in captivity from their wild ancestor species, the guanaco. Alpacas were bred from the vicuna. Both vicuna and guanaco are descendants of an extinct North American camelid.
Llamas have feet – not hooves. They are vastly more stable than horses or donkeys on rocky, uneven, or narrow trails, and their feet do not damage or tear up the grass or ground or floors like animals with hooves do.
On average, llamas are smarter than dogs and can be trained to do almost anything given time. They are most commonly trained to guard livestock, carry packs, climb mountains, pull a cart, work with the elderly or ill, and taught all manners of tricks and games – including fetch.
I can go on for days. Please! Ask me about my llama and how great they are. =D

2. I'm guessing it's a legend that he heard from one person to another, or maybe they all went out for beers and the narrator heard it from the guy who quit. I reached this answer as there is no direct mention of how it happened, but the author seems to have a lot more sympathy for the guy who quit and not the HR manager, which also reinforces the belief that it was a rough place to work.

3. The setting doesn't have much in common with *The Body*, but both are stories where one person is looking back on things that happened. Also, in both of them, the narrator admires another one of the characters greatly, nostalgic for both the events in the story and the actions taken by the other character.

It rained a lot today, making the stairs on campus slippery. I didn't think much of it, I never do. But then I saw a man go tumbling backwards down a flight of concrete stairs. 

I don't think I'll ever be able to forget the wet crisp crunch his back made upon impact with the concrete. We were behind one of the lower buildings on campus, a really old one that only holds a few classes.

We were entirely alone.

I know I've read about this feeling in the past, the absolute and total defeat of helplessness and uselessness. It had never occurred to me before that moment, the fact that calling 9-1-1 required one to speak.

He began to panic when he realized he couldn't feel his legs and that his head was bellowing blood onto the sidewalk. I knew that he shouldn't move because he probably had a back injury and moving would make it worse, but I couldn't tell him. He said his vision was blurry so typing to him wouldn't work.

I called 9-1-1 anyway and could only hope that they would realize from his incoherent yells that something was terribly wrong. I did everything I could to try to keep him from moving and eventually someone in the building came walking out to be horridly surprised. The paramedics came and left with him, saying that his life wasn't in immediate danger, despite how bad it looked.

It took me a while to wash his blood off of my hands, something I had no idea was so hard.

~
That made me realize just how useless I can be because I cannot speak. He would have gotten help sooner if I could speak, I would have been able to try to calm him down if I could speak, he wouldn't have had to suffer in silence if I could speak, I could have told him not to move if I could speak. Of course the sound and the sight and the metallic smell of the blood all get to me still, but the utter uselessness, that's what really messes with me."

Edit: Actually, let me engage with you. Instead of going for the classic reddit trend of judging other people and their relationships based on short stories told by third parties, excercise some empathy. Ask yourself what could lead a person to react that way; besides your own, initial assumption that she's a bad person.

Perhaps the wedding was a very stressful day for her, as they often are. A day of worries and organizing details and all she wanted was to rest and be treated nicely, not be at the centre of a joke at her expense.

Some people get hurt by jokes like that. It is not their fault if they did not develop that kind of humor.

Perhaps her family was overbearing or a part of her is afraid the marriage will not work out. Perhaps her mother married 5 times and she does not want to become like her mother.

Perhaps OP touched a nerve. Also, since OP did not know she would react badly maybe he didn't know her well enough and therefore should not have gone for such a joke. That's the kind of joke you only tell when you're positive the person you're teasing will appreciate it. 

Perhaps people have different sensibilities, sense of humor and concepts of what is appropriate and you should try and see things from their POV before judging so harshly based on a reddit comment.

I think the joke is  ok, but it's the kind of joke you only tell when you're sure the people will like it. I'm not hating on OP, he made a mistake and he owns up to it.

And maybe you are right and she is just an unpleasant person and her husband has chosen badly when finding a wife.

What disturbs me is that her being a bad person is the only explanation you'd consider and you're so sure of it based on very little evidence.

2nd edit: I'm going to go ahead and tell you all to go fuck yourselves. You judgemental, superficial pricks. Life is not made of easy, pre-packaged explanations that apply to everything. 

Grow up, reddit."

She HATES this plot development. ""Why would they pick CJ to replace Leo? What a stupid choice. How does that make any sense at all? She has no military experience, she has no powerful political connections, this would very clearly alienate Josh and Toby, this would never happen in real life!""

I say, ""give her a shot, maybe they'll address all these issues in upcoming episodes, and who even cares, it's just a tv show, none of this actually happens in real life.""

She bursts into tears. ""I'm allowed to have an opinion. I think it's stupid and I don't like it and I don't know why that isn't ok. I don't know why you have to defend it.""

I say, ""ok, Jesus, I'm sorry. I thought we were just talking about a tv show, I didn't realize it was that important to you, I agree that it's a strange storytelling leap, I just trust President Bartlet I guess.""

""Fucking stop, I don't need your apologies, just shut up and watch the stupid show.""

I think, ""ok fuck all this noise, first I'm an asshole for not caring about the professional development of fictional characters, then I'm an asshole for apologizing. If she wants to be in a mood, she can be in a mood, I don't need to engage in this shit.""

We sit in silence and awkwardly watch a couple episodes, neither moving lest we break the peace. After two hours of stewing, she turns to me and says ""hey I'm sorry I snapped earlier when you were just trying to apologize.""

And like an idiot, I snap, ""I don't need your apologies, just shut up and watch the stupid show.""

We watch two more episodes in tense silence before she leaves for work without saying goodbye, and I'm free to move about our apartment without feeling like doing so somehow equates to losing the argument.

14117,"The ""Michael Jordan didn't retire"" theory.

Michael Jordan didn't retire from basketball in 1993, he was secretly suspended by the commissioner for gambling on basketball. But, the NBA knew that Jordan was a huge money maker for the NBA, not to mention all of his endorsments. So, everyone came to an agreement that Jordan would secretly be suspended for a year before coming back.

It's well known that Jordan WAS A gambler. He was caught gambling over $57,000 before a playoff game in 1993. Some people even say Jordan would randomly gamble over $10,000 while golfing, he was reckless in gambling. But, he would become angry when it didn't go his way. 

Some people tie this to the murder of his dad in 1993. Jordan had recently purchased a car for his dad, and while driving down the highway, he pulled over to take a nap. That was when he was murdered by two men. Some theorize that this was the breaking point for the NBA's suspicion of MJ's gambling addiction. Jordan had gotten the car off a bet, but pissed some people off. So they sent some hitmen to ""repo"" it. It fits the timeline very well too. It also furthers suspicions when the case was opened again because of suspicions of tampered evidence. "

14127,"Oh boy, Oh boy do I understand the funky preacher man!

My mother passed away Chistmas 2006. I was 22 and fairly new to this being an orphan/adult thing. 
Funeral arrangements are a bitch, BUT, my mother died out of state so there added expenses/decisions/stress etc... I wasn't really in a great place (for multiple obvious reasons). I managed to get through everything but the preacher. My Uncle was an ordained minister who had preached at prisions. I asked him if he wanted to lead the service and eulogy, it would have meant so much to me and the rest of the family. He agreed. He was excited to do this final thing for his sister.

Well, he backed out the night before the funeral. Awesome. I'm atheist, and he was the only preacher I knew. I voiced this opinion to him and he said that he had already thought about that, and to make it easier on me he asked a preacher friend to stand in his place. Great! I emailed the preacher with the basics about my mother and whatnot. He seemed friendly.

Fast forward to the funeral. I get to meet the preacher. He is a giant of a man. No joke, my husband is 6 ft 3 and he looked tiny next to this man. Cool, whatevs. And he is German. Okay, whatevs. He migrated here about a year ago. He spoke English well, I was impressed. And then. Annnnd then. ""Oh, I immigrated to America because I relized that it was God's voice I was hearing"". Say what?! ""Yes, it was an amazing revelation. God told me that I needed to come to America and become a preacher. So, I studied and I chose Southern Baptist."" Oh. Fucking. Boy. This oughtta be fun. If these events occurred now, I'm not entirely sure how I would handle things, but it would NOT be to let a Schizophrenic Southern Baptist lead my mother's funeral. 

He started the service out fine, and I let out a mental sigh of relief. But then, he said ""I received email communications from Seamonkeysee, and Seamonkeysee is not an honest person. Seamonkeysee's mother is going to hell. Her soul is lost to God. And so is every soul in this room. You are all going to hell. God has told me this news and I tell you now so that you have a chance to save yourselves unlike Seamonkeysee's mother"". Rinse and repeat for 45 minutes. My family broke into two sections, one set was crying and begging for forgiveness and the other set just sat in stunned silence. I laughed. Out loud. 

Whew funerals over! Everyone is sort of milling around and talking. My Uncle approaches me and asks if he can talk to me in private about the preacher. Hell yeah! We go into a small back room that was made for such things. The preacher is there along with four other people. Oh yay! I walk roughly five feet into the room(which isn't terribly big, maybe enough room for 10-12 people), and my Uncle shuts the door, stands in front of it and informs me that he, the preacher, and these random people, are going to ""lay hands"" on me. Nope. Fuck that. I lose my shit. Uncle finally lets me out cause I'm a crazy woman. Daughter like mother. I exit said room, light a cigarette(yep, bad habit) on the way out of the funeral home. Get outside annnnd four members of my family are having a fistfight in the parking lot. 0/10 Would not do again.

14142,"This, very much so.

A truck in front of me was pulsing his brakes and moved into the center turning lane, which made it look like he was making a left turn, so I continued.  He made a wide right turn and hit the side of my car, pushing me into oncoming traffic (a speeding Ford F250), killing my father who was in the front passenger seat - and nearly killing me and my backseat passenger (a friend of my dad's I had just met).

Crazy thing about it all was, in reality, all that guy did wrong (other than not using a blinker) was moving his wrist an inch to the left for a few seconds.  That ended a life, and nearly two more.

EDIT:

To clarify, the truck that made the wide right turn was not a big rig, nor the F250, it was a small mid 80s pickup with a cattle guard.  I've driven many similar trucks and never had to make a wide right turn with them.  In fact, the driveway where the truck turned was extremely wide and had plenty of room to turn a semi into without making a wide right turn."

14175,"Me too.  I've learned two things that help a lot though.

First is to switch your mindset from ""I have to get a good night's sleep"" to ""I have to get a good night's rest"".  When you know you need to be up early there can be a bit of stress about getting to bed on time, which makes it much harder to fall asleep.  Instead, realize that if you can just totally relax in bed, even if you don't get much sleep, being in that relaxed state is still regenerative.

The funny thing is that once you take the pressure off yourself to fall asleep and just focus on relaxing, you fall asleep much easier.


The second tip is belly breathing.  Breathe deep into your belly and use this breath to calm and relax your system.  Scan yourself for any tension and use this deep breath to release it as best you can.


Using these two tips together has been a game changer for me.  In highschool, a school of 1500 kids, I had the most first period lates.  It was because I had so much trouble falling asleep.  Falling asleep has always been an issue for me.

14181,That episode really stuck with me and it now really freaks me out when adults behave in a childlike manner. I still cannot stand any show or film in which adults act childishly. I simply cannot understand why this is supposed to be funny (it's played for comedy when a father hits his head in the film 'Nativity 3' for example).
14182,Not exactly a meal: stinky tofu. Some colleagues in China showed me around Shanghai on a Saturday when i was there for a business trip.  They wanted me to try some.  One of them ate it too and seemed to enjoy it.   I had the taste of fermented garbage in mouth for hours.
14183,I'm always impressed with how incredibly in-your-face racist the past managed to be. Like we're still a racist society but it's like people in the past went out of their way to incorporate racist caricatures into their works.

And there's some ambiguity over whether she ever made a move on Greg, maybe even in this form. That would be why he is a bit of a buzz kill. "

14331,"Came here for this. Just listening to it is enough of an experience on its own, but to truly understand how much of a masterpiece this album is I think the listener has to be aware of the context. When this came out, Kanye was one of the most hated figures in American pop culture. This was after the whole Taylor Swift incident, and he had basically gone into seclusion afterwards and nobody was really quite sure what was going on with him. This was his comeback album after the controversy, his statement saying *yeah, you may hate me as a person but I'm the best goddamn artist on the face of this planet.* Gorgeous production, lyrics that were simultaneously dark, funny, introspective, hedonistic, and deeply clever. Features from musicians from all different genres woven together in such a way that they never drowned out Kanye's voice or vision but instead added to it.

My personal favorite Kanye album is Yeezus, for several reasons, but I think when we look back in a few years at the greatest rap artist ever to do it (notice I didn't say greatest lyricist, or anything like that. But in terms of the genre, Kanye has done things nobody else has ever done or will do) MBDTF will be the crown jewel in his near flawless discography. That Rick Ross verse on Devil in a New Dress! Those beautiful Bon Iver vocals on Lost in the World! The raw self-examination on Runaway! This album is certainly worth the 10/10 rating. If you haven't heard it yet, treat yourself."

The political left realizes that since we as a society have decided not to let people die on the streets, then we should actually *do something* about it. The US has had universal healthcare for decades in the form of hospitals not being able to turn away emergency room visits. Unfortunately, this form of universal healthcare is extremely expensive to paying patients in that the costs of unpaid treatment are placed on them, and it leads to worse health outcomes because if you're waiting for a situation to get bad enough to go to the emergency room then you're likely not going to get the most effective early stage treatment for your ailment. Add to that lost worker productivity due to sickness and it is economically stupid to not go universal healthcare. Free markets only work when the buyer can afford to go without the good being sold, and that simply is not the case with healthcare. Similar to that, we as a society pay for motorcyclists not wearing helmets. A motorcyclist crashing and dying for not wearing a helmet forces the state to conduct an investigation, tying up the taxpayer funded police and medical/coroner services."

I was under training and the guy training me 'gave' the runway to the VFR controller for landing an aircraft when he still had workers on the runway.  The way it works is, the ground controller 'owns' surfaces (such a taxiways or runway) for use with ground vehicles and taxiing aircraft.  He then removes them from these surfaces for landing and take-off of aircraft and 'gives' the surface to the other controller dealing with landings and take-offs.  You are expected to do a visual sweep of your surface prior to hand-off and upon receipt, this was done, but the workers were off to the side of the runway working on something at the time. As the aircraft is given his landing instruction, they notice a vehicle crossing the runway and call a missed approach and go-around.  The VFR controller baffled asks what the fuck the workers were doing there, the ground controller thought he gave them a restriction to remain off and away from the runway, but he hadn't.  His control license was pulled.

14475,"Didn't get expelled but, when I was in 6th grade, I had a huge crush on my teacher. She was an older brunette woman. She had HUGE boobs, and always wore low cut tops. For my amusement I'd act like I needed help. When she leaned over I'd just stare at them. I'd do this all the time. One day she asked to see me after class. I walk to her desk and it's just us in the classroom. She kept asking why I needed so much attention and why it felt like everything she told me went in one ear and out the other. Annnnnd of course I'm sitting there, not listening, staring at her boobs. She stops mid sentence and says ""ooooohhhhhhhhhh, I know what's going on. You like my chest!"" She just starts laughing and tells me I shouldn't let myself be distracted by breasts and the whole american pie dad sort of chat. From then-on-out she starts wearing tops that cover her cleavage. So, I'm a pretty damn good artist, specializing in realism. For whatever reason I decide it was a  good idea to draw a nude picture of her(squeezing her boobs together), IN CLASS. I draw a lot in class, and a lot of the time classmates would watch me draw, over my shoulder, without my knowledge. I just hear loudly ""Is that mrs. Smith?!"" I closed my binder, in fear. She unfortunately heard. She walked over and asks if she can see my artwork. I reluctantly show her. She just starts busting up. Calls in her buddy from the class next door and shows her. They both start laughing. So, nothing happens for a while till word gets around and the principal finds out. What the principal heard is that I brought pornography to the school. The teacher explained the situation and the principal  asked to see the drawing. He just goes, ""holy cow, that's really good! But I'm still going to call your parents."" They suspend me for a day. The funniest part is that I overheard my teacher tell my principal that her husband wanted to keep it and frame it. 
Tl;dr Drew a nude picture of my teacher, got suspended."

So yeah, my mom basically told me I was responsible for keeping the family together and that I was responsible for killing her. Obviously my mom didn't handle it well at all. 

My dad confronted me a year later because he found some love letters I had exchanged with a boy. He told me in no uncertain terms that he wanted me to tell him it was just a one time thing. So I did. What could I do; I was 15 years old!  Ironically he also told me, ""don't ever tell your mother or she'll leave us.""

When I said ""the life I deserve"" I meant I think that people aren't meant to starve, should be able to live in a somewhat stable environment, and are able to complete school and not have to sell drugs because they are starving to death. Call it entitled if you wish, I have since then got my GED and funded my first year of college with no loans, with money that I *earned* from working really hard. But I had to drop out because of bills/needing to work more to support myself and get the things I needed. Like a car, apt, food ect. ect. I know there are people who do both, and good on them. I guess I didn't have it in me to do both. There wasn't enough hours in the day.

Maybe not ""rich"" but at one point in my life, we were pretty well off. I mean we lived in Florida, orange trees in the backyard, canal with a dock right out back, and the beach was down the street.

This is when I was about 11. My dad made a decent chunk of change, but it was really his Realtor girlfriend who made the money enabling us to afford all of that. I was doing extremely well in school. In fact, we all were on the fast track to going to college pretty early. My step sister was already taking college courses when she was 16.

Theeeeen that whole Bush getting elected thing happened, the country went to war, the housing market crashed, and companies just started shutting down.

Next thing I know, I'm living in the woods for 2 months, which to be quite honest, I loved. I rode my bike to school. It really wasn't that bad considering I loved nature. The state of Florida did not agree and threw my brother and I in a foster home. That led to us going to live with my mother back in Buffalo, NY. 

I love my home town, great food. But that place has seen some way better years. It's was really hard from going from sunshine, beaches, and nice folks to broken pavement, dilapidated houses everywhere, and people were just plain rude. 

It wasn't how I was raised so I got bullied for about a year, until I hardened up. Did a couple things in middle school to let people know I was no longer to be fucked with. 

One day I found the main bully and took a hot glue gun and squirted it on the back of his neck. The next day, I cut a kid with the edge of a tin foil box in out home economics class. Never got in trouble, had the best grades in school. Everyone did so bad they couldn't afford to throw me out. This was right after they enstilled the whole bullshit ""no child left behind act"" that ruined out education system (IMO). 

Eventually my mom stopped giving a fuck all together and I found myself on the streets. It got to the point where I left NY to live in Iowa with my father again. It was a hard transition because I was still an extremely guarded person. People were pretty intimidated by me because of my attitude. 

Shit was no longer working out with my father as he became a severe abusive alcoholic. I had to fight him at least once or twice a week, so I just left. Hit the streets, started partying a lot. Started selling drugs. Then one day it came to the point where I realize I was either going to end up dead, or kill someone myself. My cousin, the guy I rolled with is doing a dime for tying a guy up to a chair naked and beating him half to death for ripping us off.

So I quit, got a bunch of shit jobs, and I'm a miserable 26 year old dude who doesn't trust anyone. 

I feel fucking robbed of the life I deserve. Half my life has been spent constantly adjusting. I just wish I had stability. I wish I could just take a vacation and see those beaches again."
14544,"When I was 12 or so I had a pet aquatic frog I kept in a little fish tank.  Being a 12yo little shit, I wanted to go play instead of cleaning his filthy tank one summer day, but my father insisted I had to do it. In an angry huff, I carried the tank to the kitchen, slammed on the faucet, filled a cup with water to act as his temporary home, scooped up my pet frog and plopped him in the cup before cleaning the tank....

... only to quickly realize in my pubescent rage I had filled the cup with scalding hot water. As quickly as I could I emptied him in the sink and transferred him to cool water, but the drastic temperature change just put him in shock I think. He quit moving. I threw him in the field out back thinking him dead, but when I went back later out of morbid curiosity he was still lying there twitching and probably suffocating.

I still feel terrible about this 20 years later. I scalded and suffocated my little buddy, all because I was being a selfish little fucker. :( I've tried to forgive myself, since there isn't anyone to do it for me. The frog certainly can't, but I just can't take this one. Probably carry that guilt and shame with me for the rest of my life. Sorry.... Frank? Oh god, I don't even remember his name!

14566,"I don't think my brother is a sociopath, but he definitely has anger issues and a side nobody likes to see. I recall whenever I was little(around six, where he would be nine or ten), he would get his cologne, tell me it was spray candy but I could only have some if I let him spray it, and then he'd spray cologne down my throat. 


I also remember several times when we would be playing by taking turns rolling each other in a big blanket, and he would roll my head up in it, tie a rope around me so I couldn't move, and suffocate me with a pillow. Many times I've almost drowned in pools because he'd hold me underwater for so long. The worst part is how my parents never did anything to help. But I got in trouble for a **lot** of stuff he did. 


To be honest, I've suppressed most of my childhood memories and only remember them when someone else speaks of it. So this thread is bringing back memories. But I remember how intense his bullying could be. How he'd do it until I cried and kept doing it. He'd always set me up to get in trouble for things. So many times he's pushed me so far that I'd finally snap and yell back, only for my parents to yell at me and spank me as a child. In all honesty, I really think he is what pushed me to developing my anorexia/bulimia.


When I really knew he must've had problems was how mad he would get over the simplest things. Like, if you accidentally broke a cheap(like a $5 pair of earphones) item of his, he would yell for a good hour about it, and be mad at you for several days because of it. 


This one time a group of guys decided to beat him up(it was like five against one), and up to this point this was the only fight my brother had lost. So he was already pissed about that, but then he saw one of the other guys had had a gun on him(legally) while they fought. The dude never pulled it on him or anything, but anytime we bring this incident up, even years later, he says things like he should've took the gun and shot him with it, or pulled out his pocket knife and stabbed him. 


He also says he's wanted to beat the hell out of his ex many times, including when they were together, though he restrained himself. The only thing that keeps me from thinking he's an absolute psychopath is the fact that he loves dogs. Absolutely adores them. And I also remember him crying one time about six years ago(that's the only time I've ever seen him cry out of the sixteen years I've been alive). 


So yeah, he's got some problems, but I don't know what they are. I hated him for these things when I was younger, but now my heart just breaks for him anytime I hear him getting so angry, or when I think about the things he's done. I wish I could hate him, but I just can't. All I can imagine is the life he could've had if he was never like this. Nothing's worse than having someone you love be so cruel and so lost."

Normally she ignores them but if they keep pressing her she'll reply.  The second they get creepy she'll block them.  I'd say 40% of the time she then has a brand new account made by the same person she just blocked messaging her why she blocked them.  A few people have even threatened to kill her, me, and her family....just because she didn't want to talk with creepy strange men from other countries.

She walks through the damn door,literaly has a major fit,tears down the tree and cusses me out in front of her son,for trying to take over her job as a mother. Same thing happened when I decided to make a nice meal from scratch. She got so pissed that I WASTED my money on ""fancy""food,and I should stay out of the kitchen because that was ""her"" space. One time I was sending msgs to my 17 year old neice on my laptop. She walks in,asks who Im talking to.

14628,"My grandfather's funeral was pretty bad. Not in a slapstick comedy kind of way. Everybody just acted like complete asses. 

For one, my mom and sister seemed to be competing for who could get the most attention. My grandfather wasn't my mom's biological father and she never really had much respect for him. When he was alive she never had a nice thing to say about him and always addressed him by his first name. Yet when he died she suddenly went around sobbing to strangers and saying ""My DAD is DEAD!"" and generally acting devastated like they were the best of friends. 

My sister only seemed sad when it was convenient. Most of the time she was laughing and showing off her new baby but whenever she noticed my mom getting attention then she would burst into tears in a really obvious way as well. When one would cry the other would cry louder. Sort of like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjyKwXms2DI) 

My brother-in-law was hyper critical of everything. If anyone went outside to smoke a cigarette at any point he would criticize them for stinking up the place. He criticized the food we prepared for afterwards. At one point the tag in the back of my shirt was sticking out and when he informed me of it he made sure to throw in there that I needed to be more mindful of my appearance (I actually looked really nice that day tyvm). I was supposed to be the one to take my grandmother's arm and walk her from the car to the mausoleum but he rushed in and grabbed her arm before I had the chance. He wore his finest military attire (the one with all the badges) and got pissy when all the retired military veterans in attendance would ask him questions about it. He also kept looking at his watch because he had a pedicure appointment later and was worried about being late for it. 

The representative sent by the navy to give the eulogy was drunk and kept cracking jokes about his own career like it was open mic night at a sports bar. His clothes were stained with food.

Oh, and the cemetery didn't allow any family members to speak at the funeral. They only gave us about 15 minutes before shooing us away. It was a busy day and they had a bunch of other services planned so as soon as the drunken navy guy sat down a cemetery official power-walked up to the podium and announced the conclusion of the service. They may as well have just played a video of Bugs Bunny saying ""That's all, folks!"" on the projector. 

I felt terrible for my grandmother. The love of her life had just died and people seemed more concerned with themselves to give her the love and support she needed. She just sat there in a daze most of the day while everyone around her bickered and made fools of themselves. "

14638,"It is volume. The Roche Limit is due to the way tides work across great distances. The side of the moon that faces the Earth is, of course, closer than the opposite side, and experiences a greater gravitational pull from the Earth, causing the moon to stretch a bit. If the moon is very close to Earth, this discrepancy overcomes the various forces that hold the moon together, causing it to fall apart and create a temporary ring system. (Fun fact: This is one of the bigger hypotheses about the creation of Saturn's well known rings.) The reason you and I don't fall apart is because we have a much lower volume, so the gravitational pull on our feet is very similar to the gravitational pull on our heads."

14641,"Finally, something I can answer. Please, everyone read this, and upvote if you're so inclined. Okay, so, I am a bank teller, and in May 2015, a federal regulation was passed that requires bank tellers to fill out a form called a CCI anytime a customer either receives cash or gives cash WITHOUT SLIDING their debit card first. It doesn't matter how small an amount. If cash changes hands in either direction, we must do this. On the form, we have to enter all the information on your driver's license, we must enter your occupation, and your social security number. As of last year, it is now the law, and every bank in north america has to do this. I say this with zero exaggeration, i and my fellow tellers are all snapped at/shouted at almost daily by at LEAST one customer who comes in without their card and a check to cash, who loses their freaking mind when they find out we need their social security number in order to process the transaction. No, i can't just ""look up your SS in the system"", because you didn't slide your card and i don't know who you are. please, remember this. tell your friends this, tell your GRANDPARENTS this, because old women are the absolute worst offenders here. This is the most miserable part of my admittedly simple job. My entire body tenses up when a middle-aged person walks up to my window with a check to cash or bills to deposit and says ""Oh, I don't have my card with me, just look me up in the system"" because I know what's coming. All of my fellow tellers feel this way. Bring your damn card, every time, or be prepared to cough up this information without treating your teller like they're trying to steal your identity. I know this is a relatively boring one and people love to hate on big banks, but the teller standing in front of you is not some corporate fat-cat out to get you. Please, upvote."

14734,"The song ""Tik Tok"" was written by a guy named [Benny Blanco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Blanco), and it contains the line ""We kick them to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger.""

That's a little bit strange, right? Mick Jagger wasn't exactly at the height of his attractiveness when the piece in question came out. Here's something interesting, though: Benny Blanco also had a hand in writing ""[Moves Like Jagger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moves_like_Jagger),"" by Maroon 5.

This is where things get weird:

The song ""The Time (Dirty Bit),"" as performed by the Black Eyed Peas, includes the following line: ""All these girls, they like my swagger, they calling me Mick Jagger,  I be rolling like a Stone."" That song was written by [John DeNicola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_DeNicola), who used to produce the music for a band called Kara's Flowers... although you might know them better by their current name of Maroon 5.

The song ""Heart and Soul,"" as performed by The Jonas Brothers, contains the following line: ""Making mistakes, but that won’t matter, if you can swag like old Mick Jagger."" It was written by a woman named [Antonina Armato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonina_Armato), who is managed by [Downtown Music Publishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Music_Publishing)... who *also* manage Maroon 5.

Now, we have to ask... even though there's obviously a link here, what's the actual connection back to Mick Jagger? There must be something, because if you have a look a Google Trends, you'll see that [Mick Jagger's popularity spiked](https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=mick%20jagger) with the release of each song. The only time in recent memory when it has been higher is during a period in March of 2014, when his girlfriend died. Why does there seem to be a cabal of artists trying to artificially inflate his appeal and popularity? 

In order to answer that, we need to turn to [Vivendi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivendi).

This is a company which owns a lot of stuff. Their subsidiaries include DailyMotion, UbiSoft, GameLoft... and the Universal Music Group. The Rolling Stones signed to Universal Music in 2008. In 2010, all of the songs listed above were released.

[Look at those Google trends again](https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=mick%20jagger). 2008 marked Mick Jagger's *lowest ever* dip in popularity, and the slump continued until February of 2010. In September of that same year, The Rolling Stones [re-released their rare concert movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladies_and_Gentlemen:_The_Rolling_Stones), securing the number one spot on four different countries' charts - the US and the UK being two of them - second place on four more, and a Double Platinum certification in Canada. 

Strangely enough, though, the only other place (besides the United States) where Platinum status was achieved was in France... which is where [Vivendi is located](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivendi).

What if all of this was carefully planned and executed?

What if there's a shadowy organization that's intent on promoting Mick Jagger for their own profit?

What if I made all of this up on a whim, and just found whatever tenuous evidence I could to support it?

**TL;DR: Mick Jagger is a puppet of the recording industry.**"

14819,"I worked for Radio Shack and not only were they an all around terrible company to work for they had this insane mandatory meeting policy.  Once or twice monthly there was a mandatory employee meeting at the district headquarters which you were written up/fired if you did not attend and you were also not paid for.  For my store this district location was 1 1/2 hours freeway drive away.  It was held at 8  a.m. sharp and you were required to be in uniform even though the headquarters was not a store and did not have any customer interaction.  These meetings were always held on Saturday morning and often ran past noon.  No lunch was provided and it was always around 4 hours long so no breaks were issued.  Keep in mind Radio Shack pays its employees exactly minimum wage which was at the time $6.50 and since I was driving 1 1/2 hours that was a significant part of my 30 hrs a week pay check.  Thankfully they are now a bankrupt joke of a going out of business sale.

Oh also one time during my employment there, there was an 8 hour Saturday ""employee retreat"" provided by the company.  What it really was, was a mandatory 8 hour training session from all the cell phone manufacturers and providers at the time giving individual 30 minute training sessions on their new products and services.  You were required to be there at 8 a.m. sharp, attend all classes and pass a test at the end of the day to verify you were paying attention.  Again we had to be in full uniform, provide our own lunch and transportation and were not paid because it wasn't work or training it was an employee outing/corporate event that was the companies gift to us."

*However*, they had some girl (who I assume was a friend or sister of the bride) play some of the video game music on the church piano prior to the actual ceremony, and it was pretty mangled because she probably hadn't practiced it much beforehand.

That's extremely vague and absolutist at the same time. Isn't having the freedom not to go bankrupt from medical bills a freedom?

&gt;(when I mention how Canada, the UK, and Scandinavian countries have universal healthcare and much better social safety nets AND are better off than the US in just about every measurable way) ""Those countries are racially homogenous.""

He rambled on for half an hour, then handed out three envelopes, two of which contained an organ donor card, and the other letters for his family and suggested funeral arrangements. When people saw him pull out the gun he implored some to 'please leave the room if this will affect you' and then put the gun in his mouth and fired.

Rows and rows, beyond sight, of slot machines. Random chance *designed* to bring more potential profit to the house than the users. And every seat was full. And nobody smiled. They all just stared at the slot machines and pulled levers for that next chance at a big win.  
  
It was dark, crowded, and I saw not one person having fun. Just flashy lights and loud carnival sounding noises coming from the machines to set the atmosphere and make people think the place was a happy and fun location.  
  
And you know some of them are just there to spend money to feel that quick high, and know damn well they are unlikely to even break even. But a lot of them are legitimately addicted to it, and you know they are draining countless thousands for that chance to win big, and any numbers person could tell you in an instant it is *not worth it.*  
  
It made me very sad. Seeing so many people being taken advantage of. More people than I can count sitting in front of those machines, and again, none of them were smiling.

15023,"15 years ago I was working in a pawn shop in Lubbock, Tx. 29th Drive @ 62/82. 29th ran into 34th St at a diagonal where there was also a small dip for drainage. Enough backstory. There was a guy with a Kawasaki Ninja that would race down 29th and onto 34th every day just after 5:00. You always knew when he was coming because of the high pitched whine so ocassionally we'd look up to see him race by at 100+ mph. Knew someday something bad was going to happen. Well, that day came. He hit the dip in the road and popped a wheelie and gunned it down 34th as was his custom. But this day there was a Suburban entering 34th from a cross street. He hit the side of the Suburban at the B pillar so hard that the SUV bent around his bike. The force ripped his head and left arm from his body and hurled it another 50 yds or so down the street. My whole shop was standing there watching it as it happened. The lady in the Suburban was quite a bit more up close and personal. She was sitting looking directly at the headless corpse."

15025,"&gt;I don't really even think he's very good at what he does

He's very good at what he does.  He isn't just a regular travel show host, if you wanted that you'd still be watching Samantha Brown getting massages in resorts on the fucking travel channel.  

Bourdain gives the most realistic experience of a traveler, not a tourist, in these locations.  

He's an excellent writer, and his narration tells a story with an impression unique to that culture on *every* episode.  

**Anthony Bourdain is creating a David Attenborough style nature documentary that focuses on different ecosystems of humans.** 

There really isn't many other formats similar to what Bourdain does.  I think as he gets older and we look back on his career we will see him more and more as the genius author he really is.  

He uses food and drink to enter people's lives.  He's gotten into forbidden zones, shared meals with enemies of his own country and victims of US aggression.  

The same way we put bait in a watering hole to make the animals comfortable enough to come out, No Reservations and Parts Unknown use food, drinks, and social life to document human truths across cultural divides.  

Compared to shit like Bizarre Foods and Guy Fieri, Anthony Bourdain deserves a fucking nobel prize. "

Right before Christmas time, people would come in RIGHT when we opened, buy our whole stock and sell them online for double what they paid. This obviously prevented families from the ability to go to Target and just buy a Wii, so we made a rule that one person could buy 2 Wiis per day. A man came in smiling like he won the lottery and said "" Im buying all the Wiis you can give me."" There was a long line of people behind him that looked outraged. I said "" Sir, the limit per customer is two Wiis.""    Him"" No......I got here first, so Im going to buy what I asked for.""   Me "" Sir, Im sorry that you feel that way, but i can only sell you two.""   Him"" Oh youre sorry? No what you are is deaf because I already told you two times. Call your manager. NOW.""

I remember one day a neighbor friend and I were playing on my porch and he let me have one of his cap guns. When my dad saw he was livid. He grabbed the gun from my hand and smashed it on the railing. I scared, confused, and upset.

It wasn't until years later that I realized why he hated them so much. I found out from my mom that when my dad was younger a friend of his threw a party. At the party, his friend went upstairs, came back down with a gun and killed himself. I finally understood why my dad reacted the way he did that day. "

I could take an impulsive trip to another continent if I wanted to.  Not because my wallet was full of money, but because there was no fear of putting $10K on a credit card.  Now I'm nothing like that.  I've learned how hard those debts are to pay down if you don't have good cash flow.  Credit is now for extreme emergencies only.

15086,"Students need to get better at fighting back against that crap. I mean, if all we are gonna do is to follow a a holier than thou text-book all semester, why the fuck do we need a professor to teach the course in the first place?

Anyway, so to get out of buying a useless textbook:

- Buy old editions
- Share books
- You have a huge library at your disposal, whatever tidbit is added in the 9th edition can easily be found in the millions of books and articles you have access to
- If there are too few books to share, ask your fellow students for what is covered in assignment X, Y, Z and go find that information yourself in the library (it is more than likely if you do so you will be better prepared)
- The big issue tend to be text-book assignments. (That's how they get you!) If that happens: Complain to the instructor, complain in your review, complain to everyone. What is the point of taking the course if all you do is text-book assignments? You might has well just bought the book yourself and sat at home and done it on your own.

Once we started dating we had all kinds of physical contact we didn't have as friends- lots of cuddling, kissing, laying around together, and while I never noticed any detectable smell on him, something changed from the second I put my nose on his neck as I hugged him good night on our first date.
