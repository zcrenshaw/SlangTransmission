1,It's back in style. Unfortunately
2,"Honestly if i'm not close with them it wouldn't bother me at all. People die, it's a part of life."

4,"That's so badly done, it's not even worth the time."
5,"I'm no Trump fan, but he never admitted any such thing. He said:

&gt;You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything...Grab ’em by the pussy. You can do anything.

Last time I checked it's not assault when people consent. ""They let you do it"" sounds a lot like consent. He's an obnoxious, sexist, childish bully, but he never committed assault as far as we know. 

Nor does him making a sexist comment mean that everyone in the nation feels the same way. The only time this is talked about it's by people criticizing him for it. 

Ah, reddit. Say something true, logical, and reasonable; immediately get downvoted. Denial is so much fun, isn't it?"

7,She never pointed out that she's female lol she just mentioned her boyfriend and whatnot
8,Butt out OP. Just upvote to show your appreciation. This trend of OPs trying to come into there own thread and double dipping comment karma is really starting to annoy me!
9,Ok. 
10,"Reddit is full of some really insecure and immature people. One of the top comments was from a mother who admitted to planning on killing her own child. She received much sympathy and compassion. You admit to cheating, and suddenly you're the worst person to walk the planet. I mean, holy crap. There's some messed up priorities if I've ever seen some. Both situations deserve to be met with the same understanding, seeing as we don't have all of the details of either story."
11,"No, that never actually happened. She actually broke up with me because some guy asked her out, and she got bored of me. 

I never met her friends, not that she had many to begin with. 

Op didn't put a serious tag."
12,He should have used a blowtorch to necrotize the rapist's balls.

14,you didn't read my post did you
15,"When your a kid and you get tackled you don't get concussions. I played rugby from when I was 6 till I was 14 always full contact at least 3 times a week. Never had a concussion never saw anyone who had a concussion. The amount of people who are subjected to what you say about only being appreciated for their atheistic prowess is pretty damn small compared to the amount of people who play the game. Everything in life has asshole who are gonna treat you like shit, that's not different in football. "
16,Just completely ignore her until it goes away (works for me)
17,Cosplay.

20,That doesnt make it right.
21,"I got married last night. My best ""man"" is also an FWB.  She did not toast.

Edit: to prevent misunderstanding, this is an open relationship and the wife knows and approves."
22,"ESports and video games in general.

Get your fat asses outside and get a real workout"
23,"You must have been adopted then, since your grandfather wasn't black."
24,/r/nocontext
25,"Defend it however you wish.  Kids are awesome.  It's not inconsiderate...it's just truth.  You act as if you should be insulated from truth, if that truth is offensive.  You aren't entitled to insulation from anything.  Your feelings are nobody's responsibility but your own and as an adult, you are expected to own your feelings without demanding that others adapt to your personal sensitivities.  

Society belongs to the children and those who have children.  Demographics are destiny, 100%.  History will be owned by those who show up.  Not having kids is the literal definition of ceding the future of your nation, your people, and your culture.  It is embracing failure and self loathing.  

The future of your nation is sitting in grade schools down the street.  That is reality, feelings or no.  

"
26,"Do you think that you're exceptional, and most everyone else is worse than you? "
27,"I'm not making light of it. His career was never the same after that, and he went through bouts of depression after bouncing around the league for awhile. Plus, I was at the game and it happened about 60 feet in front of me, so I saw how bad it was (I could hear how bad it was). I always felt terrible for him.
"

29,"Yeah, *now* they might be the top results, because it's become such a meme.   Do you honestly think the first time anybody said ""hello there"" was in a movie in 2005?  What grade are you in?  

I'm gonna blow your mind here — Michael Jordan wasn't the first black man to ever cry, either, and jizzing in your pants existed before Andy Samberg sang about it on SNL."
30,I don't know where you got this information from; but it simply is not true! Afro hair works no differently scientifically than any other hair type follicle. 
31,"Ugh you sound bitter af. I eat, I poop, I don't gain weight. Is the world gonna end because not all of us can easily put on 5 lbs even if we really tried like damn?  "
32,"Girl acts ghetto at all, my dick dies. Absolutely nothing attractive at all by acting like an ignorant fuck who sucks my tax dollars. "
33,Being heterosexual used to be OK.  
34,"Curious, how do you mean? It doesn't take much self-awareness to realize you are an unfit parent if you are literally planning the murder of your infant child. "
35,Because op didn't put a serious tag.

37,"Oh so you're saying that if Arrested Development was pg, then you would have a new user name, I get ya."
38,"Transgender, no. Transsexual, sure. 

I say no to transgender because it does feel like an invasion of privacy. I've heard the arguments of that being a irrational fear, but I feel uncomfortable around schizophrenic people too.  "

40,That absolute evil bastard deserved this &amp; SO much more!!! You're a bloody good brother! Your sister is so lucky.

42,That new hot dog one is stupid as hell too
43,"&gt; Does it give you pause that this same ""they can't become Americans, they don't understand or appreciate our culture"" has been thrown down against every other major group of immigrants in American history?

Except that there is actual data to back it up in this case.

&gt;That the vast majority of people coming to America are not the people who support their repressive governments in their home country, and who come here because they believe in the freedoms their places of birth do not believe in?

Sure. I acknowledged that in my post. Most muslims *do* support the very foundation of our society: freedom, democracy, etc. I don't have a problem with those muslims coming in.



"
44,"Better then my opinion. There are two genders, it's a synonym for sex and you can't change it. You're born with it, you don't decide and transgender falls under  a mental disorder. "
45,It is not in the Nuka World DLC. The Mechanist is the part of the small robot quest where you build custom robots. Nuka World was released much later.
46,Yea if it came up naturally
47,I'm out of that marriage. Thanks for the advice though. 
48,"Getting downvoted for wishing that a woman who tried to murder her baby wouldn't get to see her kid again, Oh reddit you fickle beast. I agree with you completely. Everyone here is kissing this womans ass for NOT MURDERING A BABY, like wow congratulations right? You hero! haha This boggles my mind. "
49,"Those were never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, EVER cool."
50,[deleted]
51,And? That's the style of humor. That's like saying the satire in South Park is predictable. No shit. 
52,This is so offensive.  You wouldn't call a retarded person a retard would you?
53,[deleted]
54,[deleted]
55,"No, but I think you should use a blanket or something. A friend of mine uses an apron. It's just an act of modesty and, in my opinion, self respect. I don't mean that in a rude way at all. I just think that your breasts are something that were made to be seen by only you and your SO and for feeding your baby. "
56,"And what if the ""phrase"" I wish people would stop using is hating on dumb ass memes and taking them too seriously?

Maybe I should've opened with that line. Made it easier for you. "
57,KAUTSKY - yeah I was at one stage a libertarian socialist perspective that I find socialist to the NDP? They seemed decent socialist or whatever the revolution and worker's dictatorship of democratic centralism and leninist principles definitely promote liberty. 
58,"1.  Solid comeback.

2.  Engaging in the same level of, ""If you aren't living my life, you're wrong,"" douchebaggery.

Edit:  Really?  It's okay to insult people for having a beard but not for not having one?  Ya'll are hypocrites."
59,"That's a stupid point and ignores the hundreds to thousands of other people whose homes businesses and recreational centers are within hearing distance of something that is 'just for you'. 

How would you like it if came to your house and shot fireworks off every half hour all night? Maybe stand outside your office with an air horn all day? Maybe go to your kids soccer game and stand in the parking lot rattling everyone's teeth with my new bass for the whole game? 

But of course this is just all for me because it makes me feel good and of course the fact that's it's a super disruptive public nuisance has nothing to do with me wanting attention or needing to show off. Nope. Total coincidence. 

This is a one person event and all the other people who live/work/play/study/eat/exist near me should accommodate it or else they aren't minding their own business. "
60,Sheldon?
61,Did you mean to say KKK but forgot they existed?
62,"&gt;33% des femmes ayant déjà été en couple admettent avoir déjà eu au cours de leur vie un rapport sexuel avec une autre personne qui leur partenaire, soit une proportion en progression lente plus continuer au cours des cinquantes dernières années: 33% en 2016, contre 24% en 2001 et 10% en 1970.

64,"If a server is ever crazy enough to judge you for anything you order, please treat them very kindly as they are obviously new to serving.


A lesson in customer service via a poor tip is not necessarily uncalled for, however."
65,This question had verbatim been posted multiple times in the past 2 years. Op you should be ashamed of yourself. 
66,"Saying ""good"" after someone asks how you're doing.  No one's ever actually good and everyone knows it."

70,"That's awful! But it would take a lot more than what you've said to have such rotten teeth at 27!!....c'mon now!! If u can't be real, anon on Reddit , ur fucked as a human being! 
You can't kid a kidder! ..... "
71,I was actually shocked to see a millennial complain. Somebody should solve that problem for him/her. 
72,"I Am Legend.  It was pretty much just Will Smith until the end, besides some flashbacks."
73,...that's still monologue. 
74,His movies are notoriously low grossing. 
75,"Some of the answers here are pathetic. Honestly I just be understanding that it's uncomfortable for her and not be awkward about it. There's no chance in hell my ass is going to the store to buy her tampons. Get the fuck outta here with that shit. She's on her period, not dying.  She can go get it herself. "
76,"That is exactly how you get killed.  Good luck punching bullets.  Every situation is different, but if you don't know what you're doing, you're probably going to get shot.  Attack in masses preferably with one person behind the door to start a struggle and create a few seconds. (This is if cornered in a classroom with no windows).

Your best bet is to NEVER STOP MOVING!  Get out by any means necessary.

82,"You guys are funny, Reddit. Its not THAT big of a deal. But I guess we all have our annoyances. 

Thankfully my girlfriend and I usually just share a big entree of what we like and a side or two. Dinner harmony."
83,thats a pretty cool way to get free clothes actually.
84,"Devils advocate. Shut the fuck up, saying ""just playing devils advocate"" doesn't make your stupid worthless opinion suddenly intelligent. "
85,"Using any emoji that isn't a basic Google blob face



Acting dumb



Not being able to kill bugs



Anything involving Disney princess shit at all or anything in general involving princess shit or royal treatment is a hard fucking no. 




Not bringing a jacket and then taking mine, get your own bitch this is my Columbia jacket. 



Dumb faces



Taking more than 2 photos because the first one or second one turned out bad. Like if you suck at photos that much, practice on your own time, and if you are that vapid and concerned about your image, do that on your own time too.

89,"I'm sure you'd be quite pissed if he bought a car and said ""drive it, or walk"" or if he just came home with dinner from a restaurant every night. Not to mention if your car broke down, he tells you to fix it yourself or you can take the bus. "

95,"I get that it makes more power,  but it requires you to be a huge jerk. Not cool. 

Edit: My understanding of a turbo diesel is that: The more air and fuel it gets,  the more power it makes until you open up the engine the expensive way.  

I get rolling coal is bad.  I own a gasoline powered vehicle.  If I go diesel,  it's going to stay stock (except for the stereo)"
