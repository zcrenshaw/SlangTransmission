1,"The entirety of Reddit loves to circle jerk about how the US is a literal cesspool worse than third world countries.  Don't let it go to your head too much.  There are problems with every form of government.  Europe is not the idyllic paradise they'd have you believe.

4,"Hmmm what is America great in? Oh right, GDP, global influence and military power. But never mind any of that. Have you actually ever been to America or met an American?"

15,"mate - im 18. 

im with you on this one, this crap started as an internet joke and it got out of hand.

now i cant stand kids on the internet because theyre all trying to be cool like this. ughh... it just irritates me on so many levels.

thankfully, kids are dropping it now. i can cope with them again. 

i dont know how the hell you live with it, you have some patience i seriously lack"
16,"It seems like the scope of the registry is a little exaggerated at times. While I did hear straight from a few horses' mouths that they wanted a registry of all Muslims, the plan in mind currently in the U.S. supposedly would only cover Muslims coming from specific countries.

So unless things change, the registry would only apply to new immigrants from places like Syria and Iraq, but not (maybe) Lebanon. Not that it makes it any less repugnant for some of us, or less Constitutional, but it wouldn't include all. This means that those of us non-Muslims who would volunteer to register ourselves as a protest and to inundate the registry, likely won't even have the option to do so."

19,She could've easily dipped into it to splurge. Sounds like ya'll are just jealous. From her side she sees it as a pat on her own back for not touching that much money for another car or something.
20,"No need for ""this."""

22,"&gt; Not to be the Devil's Advocate - But I do kind of want to note that Adolf Hitler considered the Chinese and Japanese to be ""Honorary Aryan"" as a whole (unlike Jews, a few of which he considered Honorary Aryan).:

LOL.  Thanks for that!  Best laugh i've had in a while.  If you believe that, you likely believe Donald is fit to be the pres.  It's pretty well established, documented and factual that Hitler and the Nazi's had NO love for ANY ethnicity except those of Aryan descent.  If Germany had won the war they would most definitely had gone after many Asian countries and populations too.

23,"Just because something is taught in middle school doesn't mean that most people know it.

Here's something I was taught in middle school:

(a + b)^2 = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2 )

Do you think most people know that?

A couple years later, in 10th grade, I was taught how to apply this binomial expansion to a Mendelian chart of dominant/recessive trait distribution and how it can be used to extrapolate the data to genetic frequencies in a population.

Do you think most people know that?"

29,"Republicans have cut the budget for education so much that now the only people they can hire to be teachers are child molesters.

Not a month goes by here in Phoenix without another teacher going down for fucking the students."
30,"The USA's embargo on cuban worked thusly: you, insert country here, can trade with either the USA or Cuba, but if you trade with Cuba the USA will not trade with you. 

The USA was the single largest economic and military power on earth. Who do you think other national governments chose? The USA or little Cuba? It was never a simple matter or not trading with cuba. The USA forced a situation in which other nations embargoed Cuba out of fear of the USA. "

32,Idk they definitely have more evidence supporting their claim than that Jesus is the son of a kingly ruler of the entire universe.  So while it is a dumb belief it definitely isn't as dumb as the latter.  
33,"Well, look at it this way. There's at least twice as much money being spent on people who don't work in a 9 to 5 job as there is being spent for the military and luxury goods."
34,Religion. Fuck you.
35,"&gt; I'm sorry you feel that way

heh

Sure. Local temperatures mean almost nothing. Now you tell those people to take 50 pictures in 50 parts of the world and to compare ... you'd be closer. Florida didn't really have a hurricane for, 12 years +? That really doesn't mean that 'climate change' doesn't make more hurricane or what have you.

But I also believe 'climate change' is the 'WMD's in Iraq' of this decade so what do I know.

41,"IQ less than 103, unless social intelligence or emotional intelligence is way above average. 

No college degree or attempted degree. ( an open mind is important to furthering the human race in almost any way)

If you don't know how to use a condom to prevent disease.

If you believe vaccines cause autism.

If you think females are not equal.

If race is a designation you make when determining a person's character. 

If you think your personal religion has a place in legislation.

If you speak during a movie, opera, or theatre.

If you think you're better than your neighbor because you go the new Lexus and he still has the 2016 model (insert any similar analogy about class warfare) 

If you allow someone to get out of line, and then when you told him he could get back in his spot you proceed to pretend to have never had the conversation and you make him feel and look like a piece of shit.

42,That might be a good thing.

44,"I was going to go there, but that's simply not always true anymore. Washington and Colorado helped crush that stereo type with the legalized marijuana. 

Edit-maybe you guys aren't aware of how much money legalized marijuana has brought to them states? It's pretty obvious that it's changing. "

48,"We were really drunk at a party and went into one of the bedrooms and she suggested anal. We did it, I came hard and I passed out.  When I woke up she was sleeping too so I stuck it in her butt again.  Only it wasn't her, it was the house owner's dog and it yelped and now I'm known as the animal rapist."
