0,But how was it inappropriate
1,They asked for it lol..

3,"Omg same! Luckily my bf is 6' 3"" and quite muscular so if something happens I don't have to worry lol.  He's fricken glorious."
4,"There is literally no problem with women that weight loss can't solve.  I'm completely serious.  Lose 10 lbs.  If that doesn't work, lose 10 more.  It's not easy but it's completely true."
5,"Also because of the pollution, you can never really see sun or a blue sky much, thats pretty depressing.

so many times when im having a shit day i think 'at least the sun is shining and there is not a cloud in the blue sky' most5 chinese cant say that, everything is grey."
6,But communism is bad yo! /s
7,Ever taken a shit in a dry toilet? The stain is just impolite and unsanitary. Water neglects that.
8,"No, I don't. It's my life to live and it doesn't cost any more to cremate me than it would if I were thin, and my taxes pay for my healthcare just as they would pay for anyone else who needs help for doing something I would never choose to do. I don't see anyone turning around and saying ""no you can't go skiing what if you get injured and I have to nurse you for the rest of your life"" or ""no you can't use a car because if you're in a crash I have to nurse you back to health."" 

I get to make choices with my life. If my family want to complain about it they're welcome to, and they can get the answer from me. But this wasn't directed at my family. This is directed at everyone else who thinks that just because someone is fat it magically gives their opinion about that fact any more weight than their opinion on any other life choice a fat person made lately."
9,TIL Australia wasn't part of England any longer.
10,"Another one

An engineer, a physicist and a mathematicians have to build a fence around a flock of sheep, using as little material as possible. The engineer forms the flock into a circular shape and constructs a fence around it. The physicist builds a fence with an infinite diameter and pulls it together until it fits around the flock. The mathematicians thinks for a while, then builds a fence around himself and defines himself as being outside."
11,"No you're absolutely right. Of course I believe that literally no flow of information was possible prior to the internet's invention.

That's an absolute logical conclusion to come to, give yourself a pat on the back. Next time I make a comment on a casual social website, I'll make sure my wording takes into account people with your capabilities for cognitive thought."
12,"Oh shit is it april fools already

we all know you dont have a SO"

14,"They'll probably try to find ""the equation"" that has ""the solution"".

Source: I know many engineers"
15,"If you're insured in the US you shouldn't be going bankrupt. The max out of pocket for a year is like $6800 for an individual and 13k for a family or somewhere around there. If any amount like that bankrupts you, then you have some serious financial issues to work out first. Just saying."
16,This is really not that intellectual but idk ily
17,I feel embarrassed for the women who choose to wear them in public. I can't even look at them.

22,There was one little boy in the camp who kept trying to take photos of the other boys in the shower. We kept telling him not to and he would keep doing it. At the end of the summer we confiscated his film (presumably with photos of young naked boys on it) and slipped it into a bag of film belonging to one of the counsellours we didn't like. I don't really know how that turned out in the end...
23,"Unpopular opinion, pedophiles don't have a place in an advanced society. It is not curable. They are sexually attracted to children. "
24,now watch me nay nay?

26,Religion. Bring on the down votes!
27,Feminazism basically died in the 90s

29,"No, that's Australia"
30,"No. It's the hypocrisy among the right wing that makes people angry. That everything the founders did is perfectly applicable to the modern world, but when you mention slavery it gets hand waved away as them being products of their time."
31,Does getting drilled by 20 cocks make you go nuts?

34,"Cat.

35,How's middle school going? 
36,The Holocaust actually happened
37,"Prison was what he deserved. And all you say is it's sad the teacher isn't ""beautiful"" anymore? Her rapist is walking around free and the school's done nothing to help her personally or to press charges or to somehow make sure it's less rape-y all around, and you're failing to understand why she's ""insecure"" in this environment? You really believe the sad part is shse gained weight?!  

And above you say he hadn't gotten his dick out so this woman was more ""lucky"" than the other woman raped (and murdered).  What century is this!?

Please go confess your sins (your absolute idiocy covers it up but, if you learnt anything of theology at that school, you'll figure it out).

39,"Racial division is the worst it has been in decades.

And you can't masturbate on a plane.

Thanks a lot Obama. "
40,Someone was unathletic in high school 
41,"bots dont remove stuff for saying hurty words on the internet. 

you dont need to put *'s in stuff. it looks stupid. stop."
42,"AFAIK it can actually help you from ripping your frenulum, I don't remember where I read that though."

44,Such a nerd she failed the bar exam?
45,"Well, the filling is cream."
46,"&gt; Because almost every vagina in porn looks exactly the same.

What the fuck, no they don't. Try watching porn that has more than one actress featuring in it.

Porn pussies are as many and varied as those in real life. I have no fucking idea where this idea of ""all porn pussies look the same and that 'same' is like a coin slot"" came from, because it's blatantly and demonstrably false.

-edit-

Fuck you idiots downvoting me. Tell me the following pussies look the same:

If you can look at all of those women's genitalia and tell me you can't see any differences in shape, size, colouration and so on, then I'm here to tell you you've got vision problems."
47,"I don't  think  I  said anything condescending. I just shared my contrasting experience. 

The irony is that you assume I'm  close-minded and don't understand something and only read DARE pamphlets or whatever just because I disagree with you. I haven't  written you and other drug users off but it sounds like you have completely and vehemently rejected my point of view, and made all sorts of assumptions about me."
48,"I didn't come to this thread to shit on america, but there are plenty of reasons. All the countries invaded by america, Interference in world politics, Propaganda, Racist cops, to name a few."
49,"And then there's Australia, where you can't bring peanut butter to school because some stupid fuck who's allergic to peanuts might have a bite of you sandwich and kill himself.

So much for natural selection..."
50,"No, but Islam is the least westernized religion today - obviously. 

Christian doctrine was forced to adapt to modern values. Islam also lacks the authority figures to meaningfully distance Islam from the more regressive parts of the Quran."
51,"&gt;Not a single one of these opinions are true
