Its kind of bad because you can either go the route of saying your cousin was resilient and wanted to live so badly he held on and created his own miracle, or just attribute it to so being in the sky and give your cousin no credit."
9,"Murdering toddlers.

Chasing them with a chainsaw is a lot of fun, but ~20 minutes later when you actually start disemboweling them, the fun vanishes unexpectedly."

15,"I'm not asking to debate you, but if you legitimately don't care, it seems like it makes the most sense to let the kid decide in case he does. People care about different things."

23,"I didn't get the HPV vaccine because it was so new when it came out, and now I'm married and my husband doesn't have HPV. 

I'm not sure I'll encourage my daughter to get it either. Its still a pretty young vaccine, and it only protects against certain strains. I'd prefer to teach her safe sex practices. "
24,Omfg I wish our school would ban leggings. Wwwooooowwww. No body shame blah blah blah... come on thow. 
25,When did I say that rape or sexual assault is less painful for Americans?

28,"The 2016 presidential election.

Clinton = more of the same  until that doesn't work, and then chaos, old lines of authority fail and new ones are forged, and we finally get down to the business of taking care of the antion for the first time in 40 years.

Trump = immediate chaos.  Old lines of authority fail _fast._ And then we get down to...  More painful and quicker, that's all.

But the pain's coming either way.  Just this election is little more than a matter of scheduling.

36,"can you please elaborate?
For months I am unable to fathon how a war criminal and a liar who caters to liberals and minorities (all while being under federal investigation) is better than a implusive man who may have an overly firm view of intranational politics

Did Trump's wrongdoings ever affect the amount of American lives Hillary's did?
Btw, did you every hear about the Trump is racist propaganda before he decided to run against the democrats?
And isn't Hillary the one who maintains close bonds with backwards-ass patriarchal countries who stile abide to pointless, racist and sexist laws?

Eating just plants is a surefire way [to develop heart disease and colon cancer](http://acsh.org/news/2016/03/29/why-a-vegetarian-diet-may-be-bad-for-you). It's a big problem in India, where most people are vegetarian."

42,"Who the fuck HAS room for a bucket?

You may have room for a bucket, I may have room for a bucket. But a person living in a small place may not have room for JUST a bucket to be sitting around the place.
