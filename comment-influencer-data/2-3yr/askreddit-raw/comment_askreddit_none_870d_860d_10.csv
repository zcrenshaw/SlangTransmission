0,So where do you get your news from? Those statistics seem a little off.
1,"Chinese food or ketchup? That's usually the order I've noticed before swordfish then tuna, which I'm guessing (hoping)she doesn't let it get to"
2,"These aren't feelings you repress, these are feelings that don't exist. So if you want to confuse ""zero attraction"" with ""deny,"" then sure. But as it stands, no, straight people do not say ""well fuck it, let's just watch a guy masturbate."" Because that's pretty gross considering I'm not attracted to it."
3,"Pirtaes dont have internet, checkmate, get out you troller"
4,"Ah. I suppose I only know the penalty for not having it, same as a new iphone just about. "
5,"Yeah, ok...u/ObviousBullshittery"
6,"Everyone wants sex 5+ times a week, just not with the same person"
7,Just say Gyro
8,That would require talent either from the actor or the director. Sadly it's Cavill and Snyder instead. 
9,Who keeps bread in the cupboard. There's you problem. Keep it in the fridge.  Also if you buy cheap bread it goes off quickly. A good unsliced sourdough may cost twice as much but it lasts a over a week out of the fridge and two slices is filling. That fluff is crap and make you fat.  
10,"Michigan doesnt fucking matter, it was PA and OH that lost the election. 

And your comments about insulting white men and bernie supporters sounds a whole lot like the bullshit narratives the GOP was pushing. No olive branch to the far left? did you like not pay attention to her entire platform?

 This is 100% on the voters. "
11,Do they have the luxury of changing their diets and entertainment practices to cut costs in  order to have money saved up for problems like this?
12,"But he shouldn't have even implied ""convincing"""
13,TBH this seems like your fault.
14,I think it would...

17,"wtf is this, a thread for pedophiles? Gross"
18,"Just another fresh account looking for that quick, easy karma by posting a generic question in AskReddit"
19,"How do zip codes not correspond to location? If I google my postal code I get the exact street I live on. Including a range of houses that also have my postal code. For example if I live at 3 Everyday Street and google my postal code it would tell me that the postal code is used for house 1-11 Everyday Street. 

So if a company collects your postal code they can pinpoint with startingly accuracy your location. Without ever being provided an address."
20,Kill your children before conception. 
21,"""Would never have thought of it myself""


Well, I hope you didn't develop any other habits like that."
22,Where do girls find guys in the military to date? 
23,"&gt; That's the true inhibitor of progress, not some burning of bullshitting books.

*Burning* **books** is a huge red flag that the society you're in doesn't treasure free thought.

Otherwise they wouldn't be burning fucking books."
24,"If girls just realized they could say ""I have boobs"" They would never need to be awkward again.  "
25,"

&gt;I believe in a force bigger than myself. An unseen force that binds living things. Lots of people call that force ""God."" I don't really understand it, but on some level, I feel it. 



 Its called Gravity



"
26,The
27,Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter are both so stupid. 
28,"It's not fair to exchange something with something of a way lesser value regardless whether the other party are aware of it or not.

Plus it was against store policy."
29,"You aren't black. Congratulations!!! Kidding, a lot of people in the Appas are pretty decent folk."
30,"For me, what killed Destiny was everything in Destiny. 

I remember the first day I played it. A buddy got it for me so we could play together. The ships you never got to actually fly, the *insanely* fucking repetitive strike missions, the pathetic combat (seriously, these guys made fucking Halo. Where are the cool and bizarre weapons?), and the utterly stupid storyline. ""I don't have time to explain why I don't have time to explain"" is still the single dumbest thing I've read in a mainstream game. 

I wanted to like it so bad. So very fucking bad. And it just bored the shit out of me. To this day I can't remember what any of the missions were, but I could draw you a map of the interior of the In Amber Clad. "
31,Funny how one comment can put it to the top... 
32,Boohoo. 
33,"Babe hunny I don't think You get it. I am not speaking alone when I say that as a lady I would trade away all that empty crap -doors and drinks and paying for dates- in a heart beat just be looked at like a person rather than an object a delicate thing for conquest. 

Everyone does get treated poorly in certain ways. That's absolutely true. But you know like. God so a person stands up and says hey this awful thing happens to me on a daily basis as a result of gender inequality and your response is to go oh yea well people DONT BUY MY drinks of course people r gunna think ur a pissbaby. 

Things between men and women aren't equal. I'm not saying that the patricarchy hasn't created things that affect the way men are treated negatively too it do baby girl. But uh uh this is as system that y'all created -as the ones in power I mean. Like just historically. Right so if u want stuff to change if u want stuff to get better for both sexes true equality then uh like actually try to be understanding? Kind? Sympathetic? Don't shame the group of people that y'all have systematically opressed thru out history for having something to say about that oppression and the ways that it stil goes on today? 

Or don't but uh just be aware of how u sound homie. "

35,"Work is defined as Force * time.  The wage gap does not exist because men are more well equipped physiologically to move things over periods of time.  THUS, we are only getting paid for the increase in our relative efficiency."
36,That was probably your wife u idiot jk probably just some girl who knows lol
37,It appears you've only read the headlines 
38,"As a man who's been catcalled to by women a couple times, its actually a pretty nice compliment / makes me smile. BUT it doesn't happen often."

40,"No, he is a man with gender dysphoria. "

51,I just listened to this song for the first time and I completely agree with you! 
52,Maybe after their KKK meeting.
53,"Which is unfortunate, because it's a [*terrible* movie](http://worsethanyouthought.wikidot.com/blog:_start/tag/interstellar/category/blog)."
54,Ok dude have fun where you are going
55,But their coffee is full of corn syrup and they charge crazy amounts of money for cheap coffee. Nothing is worth the stress of dealing with 100 people's order an hour every Saturday morning. I feel horrible for that guy. Living like a slave. 
56,"Yes, but unlike Quebec Belgium people are not total assholes. I love Belgium but Quebec can fuck off. "
57,Nothing like condescending someone to persuade them of communism. The irony
58,"If you could quote a sentence that long found in any McCarthy book I'd take my original statement back.

I know I still sounds like a douche, but bare with me."
59,"&gt; Most of my town are Orthodox Christians and would ruin my life if my secret ever got out.

What town (or even just region) has an Orthodox majority? You're not in the US, are you?"
60,Lol every day we stray into darnkess
61,"I'm a closet conservative (outside of Reddit). In today's world that's grounds for smearing, hateful rhetoric, ridicule, and aggression. I take careful precautions to protect my identity online because the radical leftists have proven they will come for you. 

And living in an extremely liberal state, and working in an extremely liberal field, I've learned I have to stay underground. Anything less can (and likely would) cost me my career. 

Too bad for them, though, as their behavior has only strengthened my beliefs. I've also learned they've done the same for far more than they realize. "

65,"I got no secrets and nothing that can ruin my life.  I let it all out so no one has power over me and so i can keep my mind balanced/clear.  Sometimes i can be a little too open and people are shocked by what i have to say.  I've sinced learned that sometimes less is more.

I'm quite shocked by the stuff some of you are keeping secret.  Holy shit lol.  Karma gonna get ya."

Here is a chapter of a book I am reading on climate change with the books sources and author. The big takeaway here is that climate change is both natural and man made. It is politicians and government paid scientists that fuel the alarmism. Also, Dennis Prager has a PhD and while that does not instantly make him right, it makes him credible.  "
67,"So you should never pick up a girl at a bar, because they are helpless and alcohol means they are weak and defenseless.




I have news for you, women actually like sex and enjoy having it to. Sometimes with one night stands while wasted. "
68,This is the express pass to the friend zone.
69,"DAE hate Trump lolololol. I'm such a rebel aligning myself with the DNC, RINOs, msm, and foreign countries trying to fuck the USA.

Trump has made it punk rock to be conservative. This is the weirdest timeline. "
70,"Just passing through to say: *Opposite sex* is a relatively obsolete term. Especially when it's clear you're talking about gender.

**EDIT**: In regards to the comments and downvotes, I specifically made this clear because a lot of people use ""opposite sex"" to reference instances in a gender binary. The term ""opposite"" in itself implies a binary. This is what I wanted to point out, not correcting your question."
71,Becasue there's no one behind me and also I live in a big city. Turn signals are a sure fire way to guarantee that you're not getting in the lane you need to be in.  
72,"Never was bullied

Checkmate atheists"

80,Exactly.  Power game.
81,"I don't believe the whole fight scene. You turned into some assassin all a sudden? And side stepped him, grabbed his wrist with your super reflexes, and stabbed him in the hand? Bullshit."
82,"I think you are misunderstanding HIS premise. He isnt saying that he thinks she is sexy. He is saying she is sexy just by existing and that its not opinion.
