3,"Last week in the car for the first time with a friend;

Me: ""Are you overtaking that car on the right?""
Him; ""Is that not allowed?""

First and last time."
4,Maybe in another 10 years you will have ''made it'' and $40 will be like nothing to you. 
5,"but im only 7 whats that

^/sarcasm"
6,"And if he used rap to convey that message, with the founding fathers played by minorities in an attempt to pander to a specific audience, we're going to pretend that wouldn't be an issue? But god forbid someone at Yale wear an Indian Headdress for Halloween, right?"
7,"It depends, what are we pretending today? Are we pretending race is a social construct? I can never keep track. We know that [76% of Puerto Ricans identify as white](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Puerto_Ricans), so I guess we could take them at their word."
8,"To do what? Herd sheep? They're illiterate with no job skills and only come here to get welfare, deal drugs, and set off the occasional bomb."
9,"LIFE.

 Nothing about life is free. I was forced on a planet that demands me to work under the white man's law. "

11,"So helpful,  you posted it twice "
12,"Ah, the failed 'Domino Theory' turned from communism to gun control. Damn the hyperbole, full speed ahead!!"
13,"Yes it's biased, but these are all irrefutable facts my dude"

17,Because you aren't hung like Emilio Estevez.

21,"According to a lot of them, not giving them an arbitrary monetary reward for doing their job is a personal affront to them and it makes you all sorts of terrible things."
22,Not sure about these down votes.  Quite sad.
23,"Not going to lie, PR boards do love the bossy bitch idiots more than a hardworking woman. This is because the mantra for an independent woman is to be a bad ass bitch, who will tear you down to shreds. As long as you are three things: 

1. Feminist.
2. Feminist.
3. and willingly to shove a perv's testicles in his mouth if he so even think about laying a hand on your body. "
24,Whatever floats your boat. ;)
25,You too champ! In the future put some thought into your comments and be prepared to defend them. Appreciate it.
26,"I'm a guy. Pretty much what I'm saying is I would turn into a hoe, play life on easy mode basically."
27,"That's fucked up. 

""hmm I'm somehow an expert in this newly invented field of study. I should abuse the Hippocratic oath by making things up so I can play with peoples vaginas"" "
28,Ann Frank-ly I wasn't ready for it.
29,"That joke is terrible, ann frankly you should feel ashamed of yourself."

32,Disgusting because it is YOUR FAMILY. Same sex marriage is NOT disgusting because it is two people who do not share close lineage. 
33,You are probably one of those peopel that thinks jews are white as well.

35,"It can't be r/iamverysmart if it's referring to the literal difference between '=' and '==' which is so basic on any middle-level lang-  

fuck reddit. I reme"
36,in america white kids never get caught selling drugs
37,Just regurgitated what /u/Loughla just said.   Nice contribution.

39,You sound like you're eager to wipe them out.
40,It's like she tried to tan her freckles away. 
41,[deleted]
42,If that was a joke you should've used an /s otherwise you sound like one of those retarded liberals that don't think we need a military 
43,"Neither, every user is a boy except you. 

Edit: Ah fuck "
44,When she farts in front of you.
45,"And sometimes, it's totally because of the period, so I'd still say it's legitimate, depending on how well you know the person. 

Bring on the downvotes, but you can't disagree that you might be blowing things out of proportion due to an incredible hormonal swing. I'm not unsympathetic, but I'm not going to get screamed at over nothing because your body decided that was the right call. "
46,"Personally, I've really only seen that accusation from other women who are insecure/jealous.  
  
Edit: Thought about including a statement clarifying that this was just my, very limited, personal experience and that I had no doubt that other's experiences were different, but I decided it wasn't necessary.  
Learned my lesson there, I guess."
47,"No one asks white people this, you know. So it's insulting as fuck. "
48,"It's the internet, of course you commented to argue.

Municipal restrictions on guns will never be effective in a country where guns are widely available and production is not tightly controlled. You're basically just spitting on a forest fire. Gun control requires federal intervention. Most countries have figured this out.

You also single out gun crime, and while gun crime is high in the US (which really, really should not be unexpected when you give everyone guns), so are most other types of crime. High gun ownership has done nothing to curb these other crimes, including property crimes such as theft and burglary. Especially since most burglars will target unoccupied homes (you know, so they don't get shot by surprised occupants).

You're also not going to be able to defend yourself against the US government with guns. This is an advanced, well equipped military. They have tanks, missiles, drones, aircraft, etc. You might not even have an opportunity to use your guns on anyone before you were killed or incapacitated. The second amendment made sense when militias could easily match the technology and numbers of a professional standing army. I guarantee that is not possible anymore.

It is also no comfort that most are law-abiding. Essentially, you are saying it is worth all these mass shootings just so you can play around with a gun. You are completely unwilling to give up a gun hobby, even if it means saving lives. It's sociopathic."
49,Tfw no gf ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞ ) 
50,No. Mostly because I've never seen the show.
51,"It may not help that much but it is a dose of reality. People don't realize what committing suicide will do to their friends and family, one of my friends girlfriend committed suicide and 4 months later he also committed suicide because he could not handle the pain."
52,"I agree with that too, sure.

This issue is nuanced.

I disagree that free female contraception is a right. Sometimes it is framed that way. I agree that medicine should be covered by insurance and that poor people should get medical assistance. "
53,"Well, guys like trains. It's a Y chromosome thing. We have toy trains, Tonka trucks, etc. Most women don't seem that interested in those types of things."
54,"&gt; male victims of domestic abuse and rape

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Pizzey

Feminists murdered her dog after she tried to set up men's shelters, even though she invented women's shelters.  I'm afraid you've been fed feminist propaganda."
