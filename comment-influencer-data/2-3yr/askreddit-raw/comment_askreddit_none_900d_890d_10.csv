0,"Sure buddy. And poor people are stupid, lazy, dirty and stink."
1,And then everyone clapped 
2,"I have a reverse story! There's a guy in my hometown who was such and giant dick he apparently never needed another one. The whole town knew about his micropenis. I assumed this was only local knowledge but, being the jock he was, he made a large number of associates so when I got to college I met a surprisingly large (a LOT of people) population of people who knew about his biology. "
3,"To be fair, not liking Rick and Morty is pretty serious.

Just glad my wife enjoyed it! :D"
4,That doesn't justify anything. If you don't fit the qualifications to answer a question then don't answer the question. 
5,"You must admit, I don't lack locomotivation."
6,John Oliver lost me over this election farce.
7,That's just a straw man argument. The majority of male comedians don't just make penis jokes. Don't make stuff up to support your argument.
8,Looking good.
9,"Well I was disagreeing with one of the statements that he made, which I guess was just a small part of his overall comment."
10,"I think the reasoning is that most countries as a whole are as liberal as a far-left city like San Francisco or New York.  They think people can't make their own decision in life so they require you to charge for refills.

Just like how some cities here in the US charge a sugar tax for certain drinks and limit the size of sugary drinks that are sold in restaurants."
11,What country is that in? Legit never heard of it. 
12,"I don't know what comedians you listen to. Going by the Reddit circlejerk of comedians, Louis CK, George Carlin, Mitch Hedberg, and the like all joke about more substantial things than ""benis in bagina :p sex :p masculinity"", so the hypocrisy argument doesn't really stand."
13,Because we don't have any neutral singular pronoun.
14,"Personally, I don't mind all the shit Amy gets because I don't like her and I don't like how successful she is. The more people agree that she's shit, the less I see her around and therefore get annoyed with her less frequently. I don't give a shit about being part of a anti-Amy group, I just want her to disappear as a comedian. "

16,Damn right she does.
17,"Rap and Pop, I hate that kind of music. "

19,"&gt; I can understand a line or two being omitted or changed, or a twist ending being a secret or something
&gt; but this seems like an important part of the plot that can't really be changed or omitted.

20,"Bitteraweet post. I hadn't heard of this and I've been saying horror is dead or at least on life support for a few years so I immediately checked it out.


SPOILERS




Just watched it and didn't really care for it. Admittedly, I watched the ""US"" version and my dislike of the ""Paul"" actor may have influenced my opinion. He annoys me as an actor, he's always pouty and mumble mouthed. Still, I didn't find their shtick to be creepy or anything but kind of annoying. I've seen enough horror films with killers that can't be reasoned with/seem to be living in an inside joke/torment their victims, etc. This just annoyed me, tbh.

If anything it's a giant concealed firearm commercial (ha). Two douchebags with ill-fitting gloves and a golf club wouldn't last long in most of America.

My search continues. I will admit it's better than any of the jump-scare BS Hollywood calls horror these days.

EDIT: added spolier warning"
21,"&gt; ere is no locale in the US where it's possible to live on a single minimum-wage income.

Yeah, they just die after a year or so right? 

Holy fucking entitled.

If you're in poverty because you're too good to accept a job you're going to need assistance on, what does that make all the people doing that job, taking those food stamps? Extra poverty? And the people who can't even work or get those jobs? Extra extra poverty, right? 

Ffs."
22,Clearly we have differing points of view
23,You sure?  Muslim crime and rape in Europe must be the biggest cover-up in history if you look at how wide-spread it is online..  
24,If you're watching the show Catfish on the MUSIC TELEVISION Channel you deserve 22 commercials a break 
25,Girls can be funny YYendy get over it! 
26,Kat Von D arnt a good company though. She's awful
27,Well yeah but blame the people that choose to buy from those people. 
28,Well then this question is not directed at you.
29,"Ehh... if you're only in it for the check, you're only going to go so far. They're not going to be motivated to promote someone who isn't into what they do. And you overestimate the power of money to motivate. It's temporary. If I have to give you a raise to do your job effectively, then we have a problem. If you're demotivated because you're not getting a raise when you admit you're only in it for the check, we have a problem. If you're not being appropriately compensated for the work you're doing, then you may have a bad employer. Long story short, if you're only in it for the check you're going to burn out regardless. "

31,"**TR**i**UMP**h

But oh wait this is leddit so I have to give something funny ok gimme a moment

32,"I was hoping to get Obama to overthrow the president, but dammit, he fled the country like a little bitch."
33,That's what you get when you value an imaginary concept like money over human lives and happiness.
34,Its essentially shrimp cocktail sauce
35,"That is a lie.  You know that satanism allows and encourages lying to achieve your goals.  You also know that satanists can use every tool at their disposal to destroy, harm, and hurt their enemies.  "
36,"Late to the party, I know but please read this.
My my great grandmother was a nurse at a hospital and a baseball player had come in to visit some kids for some low key PR thing. She wasn't a baseball fan so she had no clue who he was. He told he was there for whichever room he had to be in. I remember the conversation verbatim because of how often she told it.
G: What's the name?
M: You telling a joke or something?
G: No. I need your name for the register.
M: You don't know who I am?!
G: Do you know who I am?
M: No...
G: Well, how do you do, my name is Adeline, what's yours?
M: [scoffs] Mickey Mantle.
G: And how do you spell it?
M: Christ, lady! maybe you didn't hear me...Mick-ey Man-tle.
G: maybe you didn't hear me, how...do...you...spell...it?
M:[long pause, gritted teeth] M...i...
She went home that night and told her husband what had happened and she said that there was a famous guy there that she didn't know who he was and he was really mad about it. Grandpa Al asked who it was. She told him it was like some baseball guy and she didn't know, and he was a total jackass. His name is Mickey something. Grandpa Al's response: ""MICKEY GOD DAMN MANTLE?!""
I love that story.
EDIT: Hey my first gold! Awesome! Thanks anonymous redditor!
Edit 2: photo of Grandma Addy and Grampa Al holding my mom and my aunt. This would have been around 1965.
Edit 3: Young photo of Grandma Addy. It would have been very near to this time, but a little after because I think she was almost 30 in this photo."
37,Thinking back on this I can't help but feel that the writers of this assisted Donald Trump in writing speeches.
38,That's why you always make sure you're first in line.
39,It's rare to see a white man with a black woman. Why would you do that?  Don't you want someone attractive?  I know. O white man has ever been interested in me.

41,"Ugh, please don't confuse the deplorables with the rest of us.  They actually are a minority, thankfully, in spite of recent political events."
42,Nah it's still an awful adaptation.

44,"So, a nationalist dimwit?"
45,The inhumane down-voting of this comment
46,"it's a play on _Bill Nye the Science Guy_, you are the one bringing race into it. He _is_ a black guy. WTF.

47,"geeks, call them geeks. "
48,"I don't know. I am glad to hear about this stuff he did, but I am still disturbed by [the series of photos that were seized from his home because they were basically child porn.](http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=3658634&amp;page=1)

&gt; Goldin's ""Klara and Edda Belly-Dancing"" depicts two young girls, one of whom is lying down with her legs spread open.

Edit: I love how people are downvoting this. I am sorry, but Elton John is not perfect. I am glad he did a good thing, but let's not pretend he's a saint. From the sounds of it he had some pretty fucked up pictures of children, we can't just ignore that. "
49,"You keep saying ""especially like what trump is proposing"" but care to explain that instead of telling me it's Econ 101 shit? Also, it's pathetic to automatically hit the downvote to a post you're replying to and it's pretty obvious when the ones you did are at 0 and your own post is just at 1."

Professor?  Your description makes it sound like an elementary school class. "
53,ITT: women being paranoid and men being cucks. 
54,"So you've spent 17 years or so thinking it was real, and were just kinda like, ""Eh, fuck the kittens, I have nutella that needs eating""?"
55,All the homeless people I know really did bring it on themselves and are drug addicts. They were normal functioning members of society before that. 
56,"With all due respect, cops have an awful record with trans people. It's much safer for me to generalize.

Woman in Arizona arrested for 'prostitution' for standing on a street corner while trans

Ashley Diamond here in my home state raped and assaulted 7 times while in a male prison

And it goes on and on"
57,"You haven't seen poor if you think that's how poor works.

$15k is probably enough to feed a truly poor person for half their lives if not more. "
58,"Stand still on the right, walk on the left.  In America, if you are on an escalator or moving sidewalk, you stand on the left and walk on the right.

Basically, walk on the side you would drive on."
59,so is vanity
60,"I think we are both aware of what we do for each other. If we do something and don't mention it, the other notices anyway and is thankful. "
