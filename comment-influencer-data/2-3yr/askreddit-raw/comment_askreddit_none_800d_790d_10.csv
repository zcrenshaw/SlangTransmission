0,"&gt; A computer/electonics company named after a fruit keeps updating their system periodically doing damage, slowing down your device in order to get you to buy new hardware.

This is grade A, bona fide horseshit.  You have absolutely no verifiable source for this."
1,That's right. Sarcasm. Say it loud! Say it proud! It'll drown out the screams!
2,"""I am 16""

There is your fuckin problem right there."
3,In Lost when they met that dude who had to keep resetting some timer because he didn't know what would happen when it hit zero.
4,Jesus. r/theydidthemath 
5,"I'm talking people. If you took away the scale and asked a binary yes or no question about someone's beauty, you would get results that were extremely similar."
6,Don't be that guy.
7,Wah?
8,"This is why a lot of people get heated around this stuff, I've been shaving longer than you've been alive and most of the people I've spoken to seem to act as though they know everything and no one else has known real pain.

I get it, every teenager thinks their life is hell but have a bit of compassion for the people who have had something truly traumatic and out of their control. You can do something about your problem, there's guys I know that have watched people burn to a crisp in fires and can't do anything about it. Everyone has their own demons and regardless of your (or anyones' for that matter) situation you need to respect that."
9,"I agree with you here, it's similarly as callous as the practice of actual racism. But, let's agree, racism isn't predicated on playing the race card"
10,"""Hey, don't call me that"" 

""But I want to?? So I'm going to do it anyway, it's polite."""
11,"There was DLC for that shitstorm of a ""game""? "
12,Really expected this to be #1
13,Trump is President and half the country is bitter.

15,"Then leave the kid home in its crate and go out without it.  What makes you so special that you think someone else wants to have your kid scream in their ear and kick the back of their seat on a five hour red eye to Seattle?

Or what makes you think I want to listen to your kid scream and have him get all tantrumed up and throw his grilled cheese at the client I'm trying to have a business dinner with.

Please, if your kids are jerks, accept the fact that you can't do adult stuff or goto adult places for a while.

If you need a break get a sitter.  You have the option.  Once my meal is in front of me at a restaurant and you walk in with child in tow or I'm in my seat on a packed plane and you sit behind me, I don't have options.  Even though I'd gladly pay someone a hundred dollars or more in some circumstances for your kid to be gone, if I offer that, I'm the bad guy in the situation.

My live in girlfriend of 4 years has two kids and we're just now to the point that we're comfortable doing more adult type stuff with them.  I feel your pain, but how can you people who do this be so selfish as to make the people around you suffer?"
16,"Bullshit. They can weigh less, but it isn't easy. People.on Reddit are so forgiving of drug addicts and yet don't seem to understand foos addiction is a real issue. The difference is you have to eat to live. Also, some health conditions make it harder. My thyroid is off, but because I have more than one thing on so my doctor is waiting to see if it will right itself. I have been eating less, exercising more and not losing weight. Even eith calories in calories out. I didn't put on this weight overnight and I won't lose it overnight. People telling me I fat doesn't help. I know I am. I have been making great strides. After years of chronic illness that I have heen fighting for over 15 years. It is an uphill battle. Judgment doesn't help."
17,"Meh, [John Lewis](https://www.johnlewis.com) are pretty decent in this regard. They aren't looking to choke out anyone, just offer good service."
18,"&gt; This isn't dirty business

It is if they all have the same expiration date on the label."
19,"THIS is all too common. Sorry man. I truly feel that no matter the relationship status, women, given time and opportunity, majority will cheat."
20,"&gt;This insult doesn't affect me...

You can still be intimidated. 


&gt;Look, I can tell you're extremely determined to prove Republicans are somehow better people.....

Republicans do give more. No matter how you try to twist things. 

&gt;And just for the record, this Democrat (who doesn't make much money) supports three little girls in Cambodia, regularly buys presents for foster kids, gives money to homeless people on the street, and gives money to lots of animal rescues. But at the end of the day it's got nothing to do with my political views. It's got to do with the fact I see people and animals in need, and do my best to fulfill it.

I wish more Democrats would be like you.  



I dare you to look up Joe Biden's charitable giving habits. Since you gave one person's habits as an example, I don't see why I can't. "
21,You ain't no making sense idiot

23,"Ok, no. Stop it. For some people time management is actually really difficult. And I don't just mean occasionally forgetting when you need to do something. I mean literally BEING ABLE TO GRASP THE VERY CONCEPT OF TIME. For many, it's fluid and difficult to keep track of. I can feel like it only took five minutes to get ready but really I spent 20 minutes looking for my shoes. I have to constantly, and I mean constantly check my watch to remind me what time it is. So yes, if you try hard you can not be late to things, but don't go assuming you can just not ""be late"" when it's a real struggle for people. "
24,"No...it just makes it shorter. The volume remains the same...but anyway, I was just being pedantic and thought it was funny..

26,"no.

I don't know what people has in mind when say ""you are fortunate to have been born there"", like before Birth we were somewhere, waiting to be randomly send on Earth.

2 thing:

1- Achieving freedom adn whealth is just the first step, you have to keep them.

2- We are the result of our anchestor actions and wills

28,That's like saying 'girls don't really like having diarrhoea'. No crap. 
29,My future wife called me because I was late at the wedding...
30,&gt;cottoned on
31,"That's not political. That's a historical fact now given the information. What's political might be arguments about the policies of the conservative RINO's sure, but not the actual behavior and looking the other way, that's documented now, in more ways than one. And the suppress votes thing is also not political it's a reality, a horrific one that is also well documented but has been going for longer than just recently.

This thread is trolled by The_Donald trolls with their misinformation and lack of factual sources to base their claims off of apparently."
32,"I'm guessing you don't get laid much...
"
33,Voting for Trump was the right thing to do because it will reveal shit like this and keep democrats out of power forever. 
34,"Did you just assume his/her/itâ€™s gender and sexuality? 

*TRIGGERED*

35,Ugh no way. When I lived in Chicago we were a Giordano's family. Spurn the name of Lou Malnati.
36,shh that's the point of this 'questionable' advice lol (I spend far too long here... :\ )
37,"It is super childish. Like, I don't agree with you so instead of replying and explaining why I disagree and actually having a conversation I'm just going to downvote you.

Edit: M E T A "
38,... You use the knife point or the screwdriver.... 
39,"I kinda hate how so many people are into freeuse but it's never the case in real life.  We all have to jump through so many hoops before sex, yet it's so common to fantasize about not having those hoops. The fuck is wrong with people?  "
40,"Why are you sorry? They were posted publicly and it sounds like this is actually for the best. If PP has mental health issues, they should be aired, not hidden.

41,I bet everyone that has a different opinion than you is a racist.
42,LOL...I shouldn't have to explain it to you.  And won't.  Have a good one.

49,Quite a petty **strongest** opinion
50,"&gt; We aren't idiots that like to get rained on

&gt;&gt;Not sure what your elitist comment is about

Uh huh. You from Bellevue by any chance?

It rarely rains hard here, and when it does, the odds that any given person from Seattle is in a tourist spot is low. We learn to deal in other ways-hood, cap, or just tolerate it because its usually wet anyway. The umbrellas are for tourists who don't like the drizzle."
51,Ew.
52,Short term memory lmao u missed the entire point of the convo. 
53,Who want to know? 
54,Weak sauce. Stop being such a passive aggressive pussy and spit it out. What are you insinuating. You really think ima change my opinions cuz some random checked my post history? Talk about herd mentality. 
55,That's what she said. 
56,"You know that in most languages you learn to curse and therefore learn at least 50% of the language? Well, in ~~Western Russian~~ Polish, when you learn to curse, you know ALL the language"

58,That's why I always recommend a threesome left and right!
59,"I think abortion, at any point in the pregnancy, is atrocious.

I get that you don't feel that way, and that's fine. You can have your own opinion that doesn't agree with mine. I just feel like it's a terrible act.

Edit:If you ever needed proof that Reddit used the downvote button as a disagree, and a not a ""doesn't apply to the conversation"" button, this is it lmao."
60,SomeBODY once told me

63,"&gt;Basically, if the movie was set in the 2000s instead of the 70s, there wouldn't be a plot hole.

Except the movie takes place in the 70's, not the 2000's. We're not magically shoving today's technology into movies that don't take place in the present. In the 70's, texting didn't exist. Despite texting existing now, in that movie, it's still the 70's and texting still didn't exist then.

Now if OP's question involved moving the setting of the movie to accommodate for that, then fine. But that isn't what was asked. At all. OP's question is shit."

65,well maybe i'm pretentious but atleast looking up the internet comment history of strangers isn't one of my hobbies!

68,"Um..HELLO! If you cannot figure out how to get out of a car you shouldn't be driving! Here, this will get you started...

1. Unlatch seat belt

See? You can do it fella!"

71,Preach
72,"I think you're underestimating the role that capital punishment has in China. You have to remember that everyone that was killed would have instead been jailed for life meaning that, to get a more accurate representation of the numbers, you would have to take China's current prison population and add almost every person that was executed in the last 50ish years.

74,I bought threes after getting in to 2048 and found it thoroughly underwhelming. Refunded. 
75,"Mostly because it destroys the whole illusion that fun and hot people can bang, and ugly people shouldn't because ugly people are: 

* Shy

* horrible at sex

* Bad manners
