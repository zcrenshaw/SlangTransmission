0,I think OP means he tips at least what the bill is. Not a hundred. 
1,"&gt; Straight people don't go through this.

They don't go through it with their sexuality, but many straight people go through things similar or worse for other reasons. You act like this is a game of one-upping where it's trendy to be more oppressed than others."
2,"THOSE ARE HUGE! I'm a guy, 6'9 and I wear size 6 mens"
3,"Conspiracy theories are less and less likely the longer they last. 

This Trump thing has been exhausted and then resurrected and beaten to death again, and there's still no proof of any wrongdoing. The amount of time and effort that the media has poured into this without uncovering any proof has pretty much convinced me that it cannot be true. "
4,HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!
5,"I dunno man, I remember 20 years ago, if you wanted to play StarCraft with almost anyone online, better hope you had Brood Wars.  Then, funny you should say 10 years, Burning Crusade came out.  You either bought it, or hope your guild is social.

I get thread OP said microtransactions, and those are bullshit, but games haven't been a one time purchase for the *full* package for a while.

Or maybe it's just Blizzard screwing up gaming for everyone."

7,"Damn, I'm surprised you haven't been downvoted in to oblivion.
For real, fuck Gwent. 

There it is. Babies Lmao"

9,Because he just made it up to farm some sweet karma.
10,"Technically you're supposed to do that since those kinda drinks are so effin' sugary, in a really bad and unhealthy way. Might as well eat spoonfuls of sugar "
11,"To all the american voters, you must have swore to have saw Trump being a good person
Or else you wouldn't of had voted for him...
"
12,"I don't think it's something they are faking, personally, I just see it as something that pisses me off. If someone is doing this to themselves, I just want to smack them till they stop. *You are doing this to yourself! (smack) Stop!* 

I absolutely hate people who do shit to themselves, and ignore how it's affecting the people who love them. It makes me positively violent."
13,"I swear I saw a country that loved its right to vote. But, the results say that almost third of the country did not vote."
14,You're life sounds awesome ya turkey
15,"No, but theres been times ive had my fingers crossed."
16,Your mom's penis.
17,"Without looking online, name thier characters...

The first was the least of the worst, but we still got racist undertones, the obsurd agent character, Lebeuf's NOnonoNonoNOno's and a bunch of garbage that barely resembled a story. The action was nearly impossible to follow with all the slow motion spinning and shit. I still hate the design of the Transformers too. They look like scrap heap bionicals and had no personality. It was a fucked up American car commercial, complete with gratuitous objectification. The whole thing really missed every target for me and had none of the spirit of the original."

19,Did you heard about Maslow's pyramid?
20,"Saying ""YAAAAAAAAAAAS"" out of genuine excitement and joy."
21,Yeah just like it doesn't actually involve little girls if it's animated. Still seems fucked up to me. I don't want to pretend to fuck little girls any more than I want to actually do it.
22,"It basically means the story never happened, it's all a lie."
23,That's an overgeneralization
24,Oh bugger off. 
25,[deleted]
26,"&gt; How am I supposed to know (or care) what constitutes a ""one off"" to you?

the clue is in the name, mate. its the one time it happened. You obviously care enough to lecture me on the topic so don't get childish now.

&gt; Also, I am very sorry for forcing you to read. I forget that some people might have difficulty with three short paragraphs.

I was more referring to how redundant your essay was. You were lecturing me over a point I hadn't made because you had forgotten to read the very first line. 

&gt; Basically, your ""Ha! My bros and I punch each other and don't even apologize! Just have her buy the next drink!"" response/advice was p dumb and irrelevant to this situation and I just thought you should know. 

That's not what I'd said at all, bur we already established you don't read what I write. You just want to be smug on the internet to show off to strangers. I guess you are one of those toxic people we are warned about.

&gt;Sorry again for making you read. I wouldn't want to strain you.

I wonder what kind of adult would even think to write something so childish."
27,"Child here, I found out from my mother that she sold a sibling of mine when I went to visit her for the first time in years after I took a leave of absence in college. I talked to my dad about it and he shut down the conversation almost immediately. I told my other brother about it, and I'm not sure if he believes me. I suspect she sold him for drugs. It's been two and a half years since I asked my dad about it, I don't think it'll ever come up again after seeing him like that."
28,"So what classes were they taking? 
"
29,"I never knew how much I needed this sub until just now. Thank you. 

Edit: which of you miserable cocksuckers is downvoting me for this display of genuine appreciation? Fuck y'all. 

Cat. "
30,"If you don't love somebody, why did you get into a relationship with them in the first place?"
31,Pokemon cards

33,This
34,Believe what you want buddy. Just don't cry when I speak the truth. 
35, Get a gold... reddit pls
36,I think that is interesting that you downvote generic reddit jokes. As long as they are relevant and funny I tend to upvote them. To me they are like inside references for redditors. 
37,I've got aids and I want a billion dollars. 
38,"4 million  over 18 years does not make them one of the most popular bands. 

I will attack your knowledge. If you think Chevelle is one of most popular bands out there, you know nothing."
39,"So instead of being your father you married her? 

I think you are trying to imply balance but your story sounds a bit like reparations."
40,"Heck ill even send u guys money for bullets or some shit, get it done quicker "
41,"My wife was bleeding and already said the code word but I was super hard in the moment and really wanted to see how far I could separate her butt cheeks. Too bad for her, I guess."
42,"Word? I had to stop watching this movie because I found out about the end. (I have triggers so I research movie endings before I watch them just in case) (Eh, it's a living)"
43,"what kind of terrible strawman is that? you really think that guy never though about having *actual human interactions* to get girls? stop being ridiculous. his problems were far bigger than that, the first one being a quite fucked up family."
44,"&gt; The most ""fucked up"" thing there is (and isn't even bad) is that his parents are divorced and they moved around a bit. There were multiple examples of how he was coddled and spoiled by both his mom and dad, and he only argued with his step-mom because she limited his video game time or because he was a brat.

of course that's bad. kids from single families and divorced households are much more likely to be delinquents. you can't put the blame on a kid that barely ever reached adulthood. did he choose to get anti-social disorders? to be born in a dysfunctional family? and nevermind the fact that i'm not going to use the self-retrospective journal of a sick person as a proof of much value...

why do you want to shit on a guy that got it so bad? it does absolutely nothing to help people who are feeling like him."
45,Uhhh..... do you know something I dont?
46,Shitting in your SO's mouth
47,"-Using the mouse to switch programs/copy+paste/open tabs instead of hotkeys

-Typing full sentences/descriptions into Google

-Not using an AdBlocker"
48,"Excuse me? May I have some examples? Is this just more hate towards groups that leans Republicans, because it sure looks like it."
49,"Covfefe, that's why."
50,OPs mom.
51,"Of course there's a difference, but the scale is of complete importance when you're considering policy changes. You can't propose to take away vital civil liberties (and let's completely ignore whether or not this would do anything useful) to address a threat that only will affect a minute fraction of people.

Fear mongering from within is the greater threat than terrorism from without."
52,"It's hard to be specific because there are so many good examples, but the president of the united states sounds like a fucking moron these days. "
53,"I dunno.  I'm not an astronomer.  Either way, the issue is that she thought that a tree growing increases the mass of the earth."
54,Not saying something because it might be offensive/rude becaus of a rare thing that might've happened is just bad. People should talk to each other. 
55,"So it's ok if you get away with molesting children because it doesn't ruin their lives? You can downvote me, I don't fucking care. I mean I could totally misinterpreting what you're saying."
56,Yes. Proudly and unapologetically. 
57,"Did you know he ended up doing porn and making money off of his reattached penis?  The world is extremely weird. 

I bet she felt much better. it was probably the most painful thing to do other than kill him (and it was most likely because he bragged about cheating on her and such...blech bad situation all around for her)."
58,"When I compliment a girl's beautiful smile, I always say ""*Your smile is so bright, I can still see it when I close my eyes!*"". 75% of the time, it works every time."
59,"that time i got OP's mum a new dildo as delivery driver and she wanted to try it out to see if it was any good. she had to do it in front of me masturbating to get horny.


she being 750 pounds didn't help either "
60,Lol yeah crazy is crazy but if that ever became a fetish it would be a male dominated fetish.
61,"You can work as hard as you want, but if you don't work smarter along with it you'll forever be on Reddit complaining about people who already figured that out. 

Edit: Downvote me all you want guys (free speech account anyways so karma means nothing), in the end the truth is the truth. If you want a change in your life stop equating value with 80 hour weeks. Conveyor belts, buses, taxis, computers and copiers all work long hours too, but in the end they end up at the dump replaced by something more efficient. If you want more in life you have to become more than a product with a 60 year shelf life. Goodluck."
62,"rape. 

It used to be so innocent. Now everybody loses their goddamn minds"

64,"People who talk about checking privilege all the time are mostly full of shit, but dude. Come on.

Go tell the residents of The Nomad apartments down the street that they should focus on conservative investments if they really want to grow their wealth. I think they'll appreciate your insight."
65,"Don't worry, we all know your weren't molested because none of this happened. Very creative though. What 30+ year old teacher wouldn't want to bang a 13 year old they got drunk, while another 13 year is passed out drunk on the couch. lol"
66,XD
67,we totally care
68,[I think this here will explain in a fun and informative way](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=bottle+episode)
69,So do you not say thank you and are just acting like an asshole to justify your parents shitty parenting in your life 
70,Sounds like a woman

78,"That's where you're wrong.  Something tastes bitter.  RINGS are the measure of success.  Brady, Jordan, Jeter, Kobe... they all wear rings.  Stop fighting from the low ground.  Learn from Anakin, see r/prequelmemes if confused."
