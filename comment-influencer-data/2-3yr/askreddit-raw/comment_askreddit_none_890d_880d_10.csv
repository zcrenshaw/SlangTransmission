Allowing people of the same sex to have sexual relations.

8,"I had it done when I was less than a year, I don't remember a thing, and I am really glad my parents circumcised me. My brother got it done at 7 years old and he still remembers the pain, but he's glad he got it done too. 

I can justify it because every single person I know (a huge majority in Canada) that I talked to about it don't hold any sort of grudges or ill feelings towards their parents or doctors and actually prefer having circumcision. 

Call it ""chopping a bit of your dick off"" all you want but you leave out the fact that it's only a small piece of foreskin and it has the appeal and health benefits over an uncircumcised dick.  "
9,"Besides all of the reasons listed by the person I replied to, it is a social norm in the US. 
I would not have liked to be the kid to be singled out in the football locker room because of having a strange looking dick. I'm probably going to get my kid snipped too because the last thing I want him worrying about is his dick looking different than all of his friends. You may say ""but how many people actually see your penis"". Kids are curious and word spreads quick. I think you'd be shocked to find out how mean some guys can be and even the girls that will talk about it as well. I've witnessed it. Just not something I want my kid worrying about. Maybe one day it won't be a norm here, but I'm not going to be the parent making a social statement by using my kid's self esteem. "
10,"It's not just those things.  At least in the US, men/males are doing worse than women/females in nearly every measurable metric.

11,"&gt; You also can't make all people agree to dump all their nukes and be sure that nobody has any stashed away anywhere.

Of course you can. It just requires the world to agree that it is a priority. Then you have inspectors with carte-blanche inspection rights, plus severe penalties for hiding anything to do with nuclear weapons, and generous rewards for whistleblowers.

In that scenario, having nuclear weapons is not only extremely difficult (and risky) to maintain, it is effectively useless because you can't use them as a threat or even as a surprise weapon without uniting the rest of the world against you."

15,Found the armchair liberal being offended in behalf of others. If you'd ever had any real life interaction with Gypsies you'd know that my post is simply stating the realities. You should try not being professionally offended sometime and getting some real world experience - not everything is full of flowers and cuddles. There is actually some negativity out there. 
16,Why not both? Are ladies not supposed to be sexy? Why cant i have good grades and pay attention in class AND chose to be distracted by pretty ladies? Why do they have to be objects for me to find them attractive? Why am i being looked down on for having 100% natural urges? What is this 5th grade health class?

21,"Not true.  In this example if *all* males are held to the haircut rule, it would be almost impossible to prove that he targeted a religion.  There are *lots* of private schools around my area that have haircut guidelines for boys.  Three members of my immediate family had haircut guidelines, and they were both along these lines:  hair can't be longer than the earlobe, and no shaved heads.  Also no unnatural colors in the hair.  That's a *very* common dress code, especially in expensive private schools.  If the headmaster we're discussing here can be prosecuted for discriminating against Sikhs, then I can find you ten others within a 20-minute drive of my house who can be prosecuted for that.  And I guarantee it has nothing to do with Sikhs because our Sikh population is approximately zero.

But even if it is, in this case, intended to discriminate against them, you'd have to prove that.  Sikhs a fraction of less than 1% of the population here, and we've got the same haircut standards in many local schools for boys.  I've lived here for 20 years and I run with a very diverse crowd, and I've never met a Sikh.  If we've got the *exact* same standards in several schools here and practically no Sikhs, then it could be argued that this part of the dress code isn't extreme or meant to discriminate against a religion, it's just a dress code."

41,"I really want to make an in-depth analysis of car culture in America one day because frankly it makes no fucking sense to me.

There are a lot of fucking HUGE cars with ridiculous engines embedded into them yet the vast majority of cars on the road have nothing in them and one person driving and the speed limits are unbearably fucking slow.

They have five lane motorways with people driving at different speeds in different lanes. Undertaking is a very regular occurrence. In all my years of driving in the EU I've probably undertaking twice and that was due to utter idiots (with German plates both times I might add!) driving slow in the left lane. In California it was bedlam. Complete disregard for any established driving etiquette. I even saw people driving with their feet out the window on cruise control -- which brings me to my next thing: Automatic gear boxes.

Auto cars are fucking *soul crushing* to drive. With how long, straight and utterly BORING American roads are you guys want to ruin it even more with a gearbox that does it for you and use cruise-control? Madness.  When I wasn't fucking banned from /r/cars people always used to tell me how hard to navigate American roads are thus necessitating high powered cars and automatic gearboxes. Let me tell you: utter fucking **bullshit**.

The roads have such low speed limits (75mph on a 5 lane motorway -- what the fuck!?) and they are so straight and unending that it just literally makes no sense why you would need such powerful vehicles."

47,"
You can't stop the phenomenon of men being attracted sexually, animalistically, viscerally, to women. Nor should you. Of course society has to create mores and borders, of course. But the line of thinking that you just shouldn't see women as sexual beings because it's objectification or whatever is a tired trope that needs to be put to rest. 

Listen do I think it's cool to be rude or make jacking off jokes to a girl about her mom? Of course not. It's vile. Boys are vile, much of the time. No excuse, they should grow the hell up. But I have been made to feel guilty for my (hetero)sexual proclivities and read so many comments that suggest my appreciation and respect for women *as sexual beings* (not exclusively, but undeniably) is gauche and sexist, I just get fed up with it. 

I may be putting words in your mouth and if so I am sorry. I did love her. I have read her and watched her shows. I wish I had known her. "
48,"Losing weight is the trendy thing lately.

As a male who absolutely loves curvy women, it's truly sad. What's even more sad is how many curvy women believe they need to lose weight. It truly breaks my heart. You've been gifted a wonderful body yet society has beaten you into believing it's a bad thing."

Uhhhh...the privates one are exactly that. 

&gt;requiring you to buy their overpriced housing and food just to attend the school. 

Most schools don't require you to do either of those things.

&gt;What's funny is we live at a time where you can educate yourself online Will Hunting style for next to nothing

AND FINALLY, the comment comes first circle, answering it's own problems. College are expensive because people are traditionalist. You want to go get a degree at a 100+ year old university? You'll pay big dollars. Want the same degree for a lot less? Community college and/or online. SHOP around just like you would for most anything you buy. The probably biggest unpopular notion here is that higher education is a decision, not a right. Not everyone is entitled to higher education. While yes, I do like idea that everyone who has the ability to complete higher education can have resources available to help them pay to go to one and even subsidize it to an extent. On the other hand, not everyone has the right to go to a $40k/year school just because they can get accepted into one. Just because I have the ability to drive, does not give me the privilege to demand I get a loan to buy a Ferrari."
