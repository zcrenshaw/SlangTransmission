1,"It was a statement, not an argument. "
2,"Have you seen Someone standing in front of a mentally retarded person and mock them?

I haven't witnessed that before."

4,"It's amazing how many of you are telling these dirt bags who left their kids that it's OK.

It's not OK, and when their kids grow up and have either academic or emotional problems these scumbag dads will only have to look into the mirror as to why that is."
5,"*belle. As in ""Southern Belle"", not an instrument."
6,Had a son
7,"Calm your tits. He obviously thinks you've downgraded since dating him, and you think the same about him. Just because you don't thínk he's happy doesn't mean he isn't. Happiness for some people comes from other things than marriage and children. "
8,"By telling people they had sex with a minor. Doesn't matter that it was non-consensual. 

Like Inverse said, it's fucked up.  "
9,Eggs aren't alive and they cannot die. 
10,Fucking basic shit everyone should be able to figure out 
11,"Wow i didnt think i could hate her anymore, but now i do. "
12,"You're hitting a chick with a kid.. you the new daddy now like it or not! Part of the package. What do you expect him to move in with you guys?

Sucks for the kid. But why you complaining if you have what you want?"
13,I think that's the problem. The homeless can't be trusted to choose to do the right thing.  
14,"Because most people who are married are at least somewhat ready to have a child. It's easier to support a child when you have two people caring for it rather than one. It's not about how much the child costs, but how much support you can offer for it.

And again. Minimum wage was never meant permanently support people, but rather something that will teach them the basics of having a job and being responsible without the high risks of a well paying job like being a doctor or lawyer. It's the tutorial the work world. 

That is where you're GED comes in. Because if you're at least High School educated then you have literally millions of options as to what to do with life. And the majority of them lead to higher earnings. 

Again it takes all three. Having a full time job which (even at minimum wage) will support you (if you don't have a child before you're ready for it). Which to me is just as simple as: wait for marriage. "
15,V^ naysh
16,Katie?
17,"God.

Jesus.

Capitalism.

America and the government and how both are portrayed in the media."
18,It sucks
19,So you pussied when it got rough. Tsk tsk.
20,"&gt; flight-induced anxiety

Would you call that *a real medical condition*?"
21,"Yes obviously your perspective on what is worth it changes depending on how much money you have. Being able to spend $600 for a bit more comfort on a flight puts you squarely in the very rich category, people who don't have that kind of spending money aren't just poor.. they are 99% of the population. "
22,"Oh, I have a pic of that buck naked nerd treading water, his bare bubble butt for the world to see behind him in the crystal clear lake lol."
23,"That doesn't excuse the totally inaccurate geography, the lack of armor on the spartans (especially since they still aren't wearing any in the ""present"" scene), the lack of proper tactics..."

25,I'm ALPHA so I don't need shitty pickup lines. 
26,Seriously fuck op
27,"&gt; Every kid is raised at cost, child support just makes sure that one parent won't have to carry the burden alone should the parents get divorced.

And when one parent does carry that burden alone because the other parent doesn't pay child support for 10 years, what should happen?  The parent that carried the burden alone for all of those years just needs to suck it up?  

You have a very strange sense of justice.  "
28,And you still failed to realize just because they are hanging out and not dating does not mean one of them wanted to date the other for years. And your so called power move is a dick move. Stop with the invasive shit and assumptions and grow the fuck up really.
29,Oh so that's why all the waiters don't hear me when I call them. They're deaf and read lips but can't hear me shouting. And have no peripheral vision because raising my arm doesn't work either :D

31,"Spoken like a true AnCap.  
Not that there's anything wrong with that."
32,"That Seth Rich has been killed by any other means other than a ""robbery.""  Note: I'm not going to argue or debate it...just sharing what I'm seeing and hearing.  "
33,I disagree. This is a recurring sentence in all films of the saga.
34,I am glad that using a highschooler in porn didn't cause you inconvenience. That must have been a traumatic experience for you.
35,"It boggles my mind too, but rapists do and people who literally chant no means yes...."
36,Almost everything in this thread is an obvious lie.  The potentially true stories are probably lies as well
37,"No, it isn't free. Somebody is always paying, even if you're too much of a lazy bum to have never paid your taxes. "
38,but the fact i didnt know what his religion is means something. plus it makes sense since america is 70% christian. 
39,"&gt;Facts are either objectively true or untrue.

ummm, nope.  "
40,"Exactly. I can respect someone's opinions that God exists, and I won't at all butt into their safe space unless they start the argument, but the truth is the truth."
41,"How horrific, to be so callous of life. "
42,Have zero clue why you're being downvoted. The best surgeons and specialist are absolutely in the US.

44,Japanese cakes come in flavors like octopus and pine bark.
45,Most kids that keep to themselves in highschool are pussies... 
46,Dude she's a porn star theyr'e less than human
47,Pittsburgh. Absolute nightmare all times of day
48,"This one.

I promise.

I seen death in my dreams.

It hits everyone, every side. No winners.

51,"It does work, you know. Zig heil."
52,Nobody thinks that.
53,Except that's not at ALL how it goes. Most of the time it's people getting censored and banned for saying something that hurts someone's precious little feelings. But by all means continue to try and tell yourself that's not the case in this echo chamber. 
54,"AND THEN SHE SHOOTS THE RESISTANCE LADY FOR NO FUCKIN REASON AND EVERYONE'S JUST ""Lol okei"""
55,it's a debate because people like you think your wrong opinion is correct.
56,"Hahahaha, no they wouldn't. "
57,Hillary's Emails

59,More girls should think like you
60,No

63,"Agreed. On a show so dense with some of the most subtle, clever, and scientifically accurate jokes in sitcom history, he was just slapstick."
64,"I mean if you don't know the answer to a question you probably just shouldn't even comment or maybe even google it yourself rather than talking about what sounds like a [vow of chastity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chastity#Christianity).


A [born again virgin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born-again_virgin) is someone who's had sex before but then decides they're going to stop having sex until they're married."
65,[removed]
66,no one cares
67,"Respect is earned, not due."
68,Did you just assume my gender?
69,"Then Bill Clinton should be hung for treason...after you know, the first bombing of the World Trade Center on his watch."
70,"lol ""Free"" keep saying that."
71,Hint: It's 911
72,I'd consider dogs more loving (and therefore smarter) than most humans on this planet. Never seen a dog try to deny a fellow dogians rights or beliefs. 
73,I mean he was probably drunk as shit. I've had to pull my buddies off women because they were being pretty overbearing before thanks to alcohol. 
74,The hate for Uber astounds me. People want their drivers to be treated like full time employees. Yeah that'll help them until Uber runs out of money because they can't afford to pay benefits for someone who drives a couples hours on the weekend to help pay for rent. 
75,"You know he's a dude, right?"
76,"That's true. They go there for better opportunities, I believe.  They probably go because​ 'unskilled' work pays better there than in India. That being said, I am a highly right-wing person myself, and believe that the people in UK/US have full right to claim that they don't want any more outsiders. I understand and condone xenophobia (not physical violence)."
77,Sorry bro...shake off your serious airs.It is for some fun time.
78,Somehow the word 'lady' doesn't fit to the action.
79,Judging by your willingness to paint 500k people with one ignorant brush I am certain you don't. Some T_D idiots come visit the sub and suddenly the whole sub is a bunch of republican 6th graders? No.
80,The main chick on SVU's voice is this ... screechy thing. I can't stand her.
81,And the original red ranger (Jason) did gay porn?? Least that's what I heard.
82,"That seems extreme, she won the popular vote."
83,"Inspect element, they edited their clients html

Edit:Forgot about RES, thought that was a picture lol"
84,This is made up along with many other comments. You guys are pathetic.
85,So you can bring back rape and segregation?
86,You know women are not forced to pay lol you shouldn't of fucked no hoe 
87,"Saying you hate someone less than a week after news of his daughters suicide was made public? I mean I get disliking movies. I think a lot of movies are absolute crap like Tom Ford's Nocturnal Animals. That was an awful movie. Do i hate him? No it's just a movie, at least he tried to make something someone would like even if it's not me."
88,You can't give someone a paypal account. They have to set it up for themselves.
89,What else are the cops supposed to do...
