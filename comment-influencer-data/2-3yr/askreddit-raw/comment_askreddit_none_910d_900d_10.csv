Serious question, why do you think porn is wrong? Is it a religious thing? Holy moly, reading your comment, I would've thought you were talking about heroin or stealing, or something else that hurts somebody. 
&gt;Pornography to me was a poison of the mind that overrode any other activity and dulled it. I still have times now where I miss the emptiness, or convenience, but I genuinely feel like I would feel regret so I just don't do it.

Wow.. so I read this [article a while back](http://amp.livescience.com/43362-religious-perceived-porn-addiction.html) about how religious people see porn as an addiction. Does this describe you?

I think the thing is, I don't even see porn as a *problem*. In fact, I think it just shows that I have a healthy functioning sex drive. I look at porn every night. This whole thread was baffling to me- if you like it why would you want to stop? 

Doesn't it have an automatic temper on how much you do it? Like, after you masturbate don't you stop? 
 
Are you looking at it during the day when you should be working? Is it more distracting than Reddit? How much are you masturbating that this is an actual time killer that interrupts your life? 

More than Reddit? Like, you look at porn more than Reddit? Which by the hour do you waste more time on? Or video games, or tv? The average American watches 2 hours of tv a night. You cited tv as a way you STOPPED watching porn. Isn't that more unhealthy? Like, the average American dies of sitting around being fat and having heart disease, not by masturbating too much. 

&gt;play computer games, listen to music, browse reddit.. etc. Another thing to try is to replace it with things like Food network or HGTV (Home and Garden Tv) 

That's a portion of your list of alternatives. The food network. THE FOOD NETWORK. Video games. I'm BAFFLED. "
29,Wow apparently most of the gamers in this thread are about 7.
30,"true, but they do some of the funniest shit. Was changing my two year old today. He started having a conversation with me about his poopy balls. My wife asked me if I thought she looked fat, I said ""I'd fuck ya"" then my four year old looked up at her and said ""I'd fuck ya too"" I almost died laughing"
31,"All the ones in the middle will lose. They're surrounded.

36,It wouldn't. Men (and some women) would still wanna fuck it.
37,I do it to set people off. Things are pretty volatile at present so just for kicks it's fun to wind people at work up about it. Only people I don't like though. Like the constant talkers.

44,A person
45,"&gt;Then I turned into a shower every-other-day'er. Which is fine, many people do that. 

O.o Please tell me you live near the North Pole, or somewhere so dry that your sweat evaporates immediately after leaving your pores... that's the only way I'd find ""fine"" for ""many people"" not to shower daily..."
46,How?  Because I understand that the world shouldn't revolve around what a single person wants?
47,"20 years ago? He wouldn't know about all the controversies and media bullcrap that occurred during the debate, so would not be all that surprised. Would probably be more ""Oh really? Okay, so, what else happened?"""
48,"This post right here is why normal people hate the SJW movement.

53,How do you know the race of OP or the family in their story?
54,"Hint...reread this....take it in...this is what we in the south call bullshit. 

As someone who actually was abused, this does no favors to kids experiencing it. Not to mention the racial undertone."
55,"I always thought this was something girls didn't catch and guys had to explain it to them. 

[edit]: misunderstood OP"
56,"Well it happened, but it wasn't that bad."
57,"Not trying to downplay what you're saying but I'm a 6' guy that wouldn't stand a chance against a strong man or woman. I always do first (and probably second) dates in public because what if they're crazy and try to accuse me of rape if we're alone in her house? It'sâ€‹ just being careful, not constrained to being female right?"
58,"But you are already balls deep, and if she is schizophrenic, and is living with out a care taker, they are probably pretty small, so they could not get away. Then they would forget about it.

Reminder: The first comment I had did say she agreed to Anal sex. Meaning you probably have sex regularly meaning she agreed to that to so it's not rape. This comment kinda sounded not ok, but just so you know, thats not where I was going."
59,"I went to their website. Their shoes are $89.95 per pair, and stuff like this is usually cheaper at a retail store.

Why would you need fake ones?"
60,"As much as I agree, I disagree. Once a woman is pretty I don't care how pretty she is. I don't want to have sex with unattractive (my opinion) women, but I don't value them less. I still make friends with them and care about them, I just don't want a physical relationship. They are essentially men to me. They no more have low value than men have low value in my eyes.

My biggest thing is weight. Most thin women are attractive to me. If you're reasonably attractive to me then it doesn't matter if someone else is technically more attractive. It's like, sure, objectively 50 million dollars is more than 40 million dollars, but when picking a mate I am not taking into consideration that one is richer.

I understand that being judged on looks is still a problem, but I think it's overstated. I just can't see how a straight man values another man over an unattractive woman. To me they are the same: people who I don't want to fuck."

66,"Like I said, I know they're horror stories with very infrequent and unique cases. But it's a nagging feeling in the back of my head. 

Every time I like a girl, I get this moment of despair ""what if she's the cheating and rumour spreading type"". I've known girls and women that have emotionally scarred boys through bullying. It's so much more painful to handle, too.

I know my feelings aren't logical, but confirmation bias never is logical anyway."

68,Prove it

70,"Actually, that depends on a person's preference. I know plenty of men and women who find it very attractive. Not being attractive to you does not mean that it is just across the board not attractive. "
