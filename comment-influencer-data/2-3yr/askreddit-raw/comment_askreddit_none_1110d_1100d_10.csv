9,"Isn't that the same idea as criticizing someone for only playing the electric and never playing the bass?

Of course its good to diversity, but there are a lot of different styles in manga/anime alone that its not really a problem if they stick to one medium and explore around in it."

15,"Other way around. Feminism holds that you, a dude, are nothing *but* a walking dick who only wants to stick it into a woman. You are never capable of emotions or feelings and exist as nothing more than a vicious brute that needs to be constantly told not to rape anyone.

In fact feminism believes this so much that one of the most powerful and influential feminist researchers in the western world codified that in one of her publications.

"" It is inappropriate to consider as a rape victim a man who engages in unwanted sexual intercourse with a woman."" -Dr. Mary P. Koss.

This is word for word the standard the CDC, a government agency, uses to determine what is and isn't rape in the National Intimate partner and Sexual Violence Survey, the largest and most comprehensive study of those topics run in the US."

26,"He doesn't like that your friends with his gf. I wouldn't either. 

Guys are only 'friends' with girls because they think its gonna lead to sex. 

Or at least at one stage you were attracted to her. But she friendzoned you.

To those downvoting: 

If you're a bloke answer this. If one of your girl 'friends' asked you to come over and bang right now. Would you go over? Answer honestly. 

If you're a woman. Text your boy 'friends' to come over and bang right now. Please post results.

34,"&gt;""gay people are icky""


They are. ^^^Obviously ^^^subjective ^^^personal ^^^experience.

But they should have the right to reasonable levels of public affection just like everybody else. They should not be shamed for behaving like any other loving couple.

I should have to be polite and reasonable about it to the degree that I would extend that courtesy to any other couple.

edit: I assume the downvotes are because I didn't lie and falsify my experience to pretend that my gut reaction lines up with my political convictions."

38,"&gt; The state has an interest in protecting people from discrimination.

I disagree. You have every right to discriminate in your business for whatever reason you choose. This is guaranteed by the first amendment. The civil rights act of 1964 is great in that it did away with Jim Crow, but it wrong in this one area. But the case that is the best example of this is in Washington with Arlene's Flowers. She refused to provide flowers to a gay wedding due to her ""relationship with Jesus Christ."" This isn't even discrimination against an individual. It's a refusal to participate in an event on the basis of religion. The owner of a private business has the right, per the first amendment, of free association. More importantly, the freedom ***from*** association. 

Now, I know that the laws in some areas are different. But this is a constitutional issue. Technically, it is illegal to discriminate in your business, but it shouldn't be, per the constitution."
39,"There are several reasons why someone may choose not to eat wheat.  Scientific or not, it doesn't mean they're faking it.  Unless they literally say ""I have celiac disease"" they aren't faking.  I don't really see why you would take exception to someone deciding not to eat a certain food for ANY reason."

42,"Not saying I'm leftist, I'm a moderate fiscal conservative.  

And this isn't right wing propaganda, it's a pretty solid argument based on the idea that if the US nationalized health care, it would   
A. require a constitutional amendment to get it through the courts,  and   
B.  would be massive undertaking that would take decades to work out, also,  
C.  would be majorly expensive, the US spends like 3x what other OECD countries do, and that would result in massive tax hikes, which would set back the world economy since it would be on Middle class americans too.    


You can say it's right wing propaganda, but it's not, though you don't care, it doesn't jive with your narrative if it isn't.  "
