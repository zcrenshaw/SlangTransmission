2,"Wow it finally seems acceptable to go for nice aryan girls with normal white Breasts. Didn't expect this much support here. Ave true to caesar brothers! 
No racemixing tho. "
3,"iirc I think maybe he was running late, so I was waiting on him.  And I think he had a bite.

Like I said, the guy doesn't HAVE to pay.  But I'm paying attention to this shit and it's probably a tally in the 'con' column if he doesn't.

But there's exceptions- last night was a Starbucks first date, the guy left his wallet in the car and ran out to get it.  I didn't want to wait so I went ahead and ordered and paid.  No big deal.  The fact that he was *attempting* to pay for is a tally in the 'pro' column the same as if he had paid."
4,"Umm, seriously? It's pretty famous, and well known. :/"
5,Nature can go fuck itself. All hail the technological revolution!

12,The mountain of debt they carry around for the next 25 years is fitting punishment for turning away from the one true path of STEM.
13,"Nice try. I made no assumptions of gender. Unlike you. ""First off"" is used to call someone on their shit. Has nothing to do with gender."
14,My friends aren't like that at all.
15,Foreign languages need to stop being taught. No one learns labguages
16,"Ha... A few of my friends and I ganged banged multiple girls a few times. (so we all know who's packing) and I've got them laid by making big dick comments to chicks. I've never heard of girls thinking this, but they never said anything ( like he's gay or what not) to me, NEVER, it all of a sudden makes sense. 

Sorry for perpetuating a stereotype. "

29,"'Murica where plenty of mostly harmless things are restricted or banned but guns are still easy to acquire in most states because ""Ma constitution""."
30,"Analogue clocks suck they're like books, lol I ain't got time to read this shit. Also they don't even work in europe cause when I went to visit my friend I found out their days end at 24 instead of 12. So they're completely useless over there."
31,"In some states through the US, there is no limit as to when a child can be aborted prior to birth, so it is 'technically' legal to abort a child then. Obviously if you decided then you couldn't really do it, but theoretically if you planned on it prior, you'd legally be allowed to kill the baby mid birth."
32,I used to be a shitlord on FPH and even I think this is out of line.

44,Aren't you just spraying other people's shit on yourself?
45,"I've used other VR but I'm not shelling out thousands on a high end VR set up for choppy games.

I'm not basing my judgement on just the crappy mobile VR market but that market is making it worse with flooding everything with crap."

48,are you jewish?

50,"&gt;However I will not give you any indications of what you did wrong, you will have to work that out for yourself

Ok, so a female cat then. 

Edit: down voted by people with little or no relationship experience apparently."
51,Its not vague when you are talking about trans. Use context
52,"To be fair, I think what happens to some people in this situation is that they realize they've married a child, and they just can't take it anymore.

If your parent dies, it's perfectly normal to be sad and depressed for a while.  But most adults can still carry on a fairly normal life, they can keep jobs, they can help raise children etc.  But I've seen some people who are so overly attached to their parents that they just drop out of everything.  They basically become another child that the other partner ends up taking care of, and people just get tired/sick of it.

Not that that excuses just cheating on them, but it can certainly lead up to a breakup."

Straight male: gay porn would probably make me throw up."
63,Yes this
64,"You're a smart one, to pay it off every month.  But even so, I bet you could be even thriftier if you were paying in cash, personally saying goodbye to President Jackson three hundred times a month."
65,"Yeah. I'm really going to take the word of someone that doesn't know how to spell the word, much less what it actually means."
66,TOO SOON! Lol
67,Hey man you seem like an idiot to me so maybe we just kill you too
68,"She sweated a lot.  I mean a freakish amount.  Turns out, she was on lithium for her crazies."
69,And you're the poor whining white guy crying that the whole world's out to get him.
70,"How many people in the world could we take out of poverty and give decent lives if we distributed 10% of our total wealth to them?  
"
71,"Tip: You can use control f or command f to search for a text.

control f for windows

command f for mac"
72,You can't do anything differently.
73,Claiming sexuality is fluid or it's a spectrum. To me that sounds like it's claiming everyone is bisexual.
