"
8,"&gt;That every rape accusation that doesn't end in prosecution is a false accusation

Or the exact opposite, that every rape accusation is true until proven false which leads to stats like ""98% of rapists never see a day in jail"" because obviously, if there were no charges because of lack of evidence or smthg similar, the guy is still a rapist."
9,Fucking cunt.
10,"The start of Brexit, just to watch more of the suffering in /r/unitedkingdom

Honestly, my favourite part of Brexit and Trump happening is the complete disbelief of the young left, it's great. I love watching outrage culture in action.

That's why the presidential election was a win win for me. I either get to watch the left act outraged or the right, both are extremely enjoyable."

33,"CNN kept telling everyone that some drunk old lady was going to be president, lied about the polls and lied about an individual that wants us to have a better life.  CNN lied about the crowds, wouldn't show the old lady hocking up lungers and wouldn't shed any light on the old hags criminal background.  To top it off, everything they came out of the vodka saturated old lady was a lie and couldn't tell the truth about a mother fucking thing!  Things got so bad that people turned CNN off and now they have fewer viewers than the Garden Channel.  So whenever CNN reports on anything, they are lying."

I've also cracked a tooth open and experienced that pain as well (and yeah, it's very painful) You're sister must have kicked you in the gooch rather than the nuts if you think a toothache is worse."
40,Also known as attention whoring.
