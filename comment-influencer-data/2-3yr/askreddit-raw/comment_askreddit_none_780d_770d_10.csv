1,"thats not lacking class, as much as giving everyone a big fuck you. lol

I think its kind of amusing.  I would think they had a ton of money, but the Ferrari proves they dont.  Still amusing though. Persians?"
2,Okay so why bother with it in the western world where it isn't needed. Why not go somewhere else with it where it is needed?
3,Still your president.

7,"Thats good to know. I like to think my Scottish, English, and Irish ancestry is partially responsible for my good drinking genes. I also wondered if there are a lot of people who don't drink at all in the UK bringing down the average."
8,Reading this thread is just making me hate women more. I am a woman. Here's a thank you to all the guys out there who put up with garbage and never get appreciation. 
9,"Well, on the one hand, there are all the good and sunny things people in this thread are saying about the British, which are generally true. But UK is more than just England.

I have lived with and around English for years now. Scots and Irish are great fun, as well as Welsh and Cornish. But the English are... different.

For starters, they hate everyone, even each other. ""The wogs start at Calais"" is a good indication of the mindset. To the English, anyone from somewhere else is viewed with suspicion and dislike. They're immensely critical of every other country, and still have the colonial mindset. Go to any country in Asia and you'll find British pubs serving all-day breakfast to hung over English types, and rarely will you find them in any of the local restaurants. They hang out in enclaves and bring a bit of England wherever they go.

They dislike people with education, holding up the common working man as their glowing paragon. Got a postgraduate degree? They sneer at you for putting on airs and being superior. They hold their ignorance up with pride. Sitting and reading a book? You must be one of them posh bastards. Throw a half brick at him!

They're a violent people. They love to slag off Americans and their guns, but they are the ones who turned glass into a verb. I have never heard of anyone in the US glassing someone in a bar, and stabbings are rare.

They seem to be a nation of petty thieves. More than once I've heard English people commenting on how we have chairs out on our porches, saying that in England they'd immediately get nicked. 

And then there's the drinking. Oh god, the drinking. Every time I see westerners getting plastered and behaving badly they are talking with English accents. Guy passed out on a beach? English. Getting loud and aggressive in bars? English. I watched a group of English scuba divers in Sri Lanka strutting around the bar I was in slamming back Jaegermeister and showing off for two local girls, then trying to invite themselves to their table. When they were politely refused they went back to their own table, loudly slagging the girls off. There was vomiting involved as well before they staggered off to the next place. And this was not unusual.

The English are a dour, grim lot who deal with their simmering anger and misery by drinking, fighting and dark humor and sneering at everyone else.

The Scots and Irish, on the other hand, will welcome you in cheerfully. Lovely people."
10,Ew... 
11,Nope they just end up looking like witches. Specially the ones with the long curved noses 
12,"Well, unless it is half dead."
13,That says all I need to know.

15,Oh thats illegal and dangerous.
16,"Just look at the people complaining about Trans in the Military. The same liberal groups that bitch about too much money being put into the Military, and that we do too many wars...is now complaining that they can't be allowed into the Military.

Democracy...doesn't hold true for Democrats no matter how much their name seems to mean so.

17,"No one cares about your kidney stone. If you had claimed to be of the female gender we would have. I recommend in this in the future. Also throwing up is quite unflattering...maybe include more interesting details. Length, girth, vigor are some buzz words. You're welcome."

20,"then leave society, were a place that helps each other."
21,"Yeah literally health-wise women have an advantage in the cardiovascular and disease resistance arena. However young women sleeping with older men is very common whereas young men sleeping with older women is not, because they are not attractive; with very few exceptions, where a very small portion of the female population above the age of 31 (and really never past the age of 50) are considered attractive (see cougars) nearly everyone would prefer a woman 18-28. Old women can run or do whatever but men are attracted to youthful beauty (soft skin) and signs of fertility (those hips) where women are attracted to looks but also power (social and monetary) "
22,"Trump's ""diplomatic"" visit to the UK

[edit] We're answering a question based on a legend (i.e.  Not fact) so my answer wasn't 100% serious. But I felt it obvious enough that I didn't require an /s at the end. Evidently the butt hurt Trump supporters have proved me wrong!"
23,"Wrong.

Liberals call right-wingers fascist and nazis because they can't win debates without their branding tools.

Right-wingers call SJWs SJWs to mock SJW policies and SJW ideals. But if you wanted, and agreed to not use any ""Poisoned words"" yourself, they could easily debate SJWs into the ground anyway."
24,"Are you actually suggesting that the people in Dresden deserved what happened to them? Politicians start wars. Not innocent people who get bombed in cities. That's disgusting.

And it does come down as one of the worst bombing, every historian I have met and conversed with on that subject agrees."
25,eh fuck tea
26,"curious? use some common sense

smoke is smoke. It's all bad for you."
27,"Except by your absurdist logic it's now rape even if I so much as say I'm taller than I am or if she wore a lot of makeup. Why? Because that consent was predicated on a purposeful lie.

Stop. Cheapening. Rape."
28,The military turns down people for mental instability. You can't say people going through the difficult and stressful process of gender reassignment are mentally fit to serve in the military. 
29,Shame. I would have preferred it if the whole series had turned out to be a LSD trip for some poor soul in a war torn country.

34,"If shes insecure about her pubes, why didnt she just shave them...or at least trim. Its common sense people, keep that shit trimmed up nice."
35,"you said you really want casual sex yet can't get it. every single attractive girl i have met, or was ever friends with, or dated, had to constantly fight off men. 

there is no possibility that you are better than average looking, which is what you claimed when you said there were a 6. i know a few attractive girls who are so shy and full of social anxiety its retarded, and they have still fucked attractive men and dated attractive men, because men throw themselves at them.

sorry, you're delusional. maybe you could lose weight or do your make up better, idk, but something is very off putting if you're 25 and couldn't get a fuck. "
36,Part of me is hoping this is a Sonic Boom reference when Cubot said the same thing whilist in a video game... but part of me feels I just watch too many cartoons lol.

Cheers for saving us from a war allowed by the incompetence of you and your European buddies in the first place but you're still a cunt.

43,"You should never google the track: ""in heaven with you"" by tendril. 

It's also on Spotify. 

Don't do it. It'll change you. 

(You totally should do that)"
44,Omg it's almost like we don't live hundreds of years in the past
45,"&gt;Doesn't matter. Your comment condemned me for not keeping someone who DID commit a murder on staff.


I was objecting to your having told someone else that this guy was a rapist and a murderer when the original comment didn't contain anything about a rape, just a murder.

&gt;  If so, why in your opinion is rape so much worse than murder?

I think most of us can envision a circumstance in which we might be emotionally overwrought enough to kill someone (as apparently happened to this guy, because he was found not guilty by reason of insanity).  That's not true for a rape. Murder is *worse* than rape, but while I can potentially empathize with a murderer, I have a much harder time empathizing with a rapist. 
"
46,The holocaust.
47,"It's unlikely. 

The world literally revolves around the internet at this point. If googling your name doesn't come up with anything it is far more likely that someone has taken drastic steps to hide it than that there was nothing to begin with.  Assuming something negative is just playing the odds. 

If you truly and intentionally have no online presence, that might be something to bring up yourself instead of waiting for someone to find out. "

50,"&gt;Reddit just hates her because she dares to continue existing while not being attractive. It's the same thing with Lena Dunham.

Not really, no."
51,That's because I was directly responding to your post by pointing out the actual origin of that phenomenon and why it comes from sexism against men rather than chauvinism.
52,That was my first thought. People are still reading that shit?

57,"I see nothing wrong with this as long as she's attractive. Plus it's the middle of summer and she's pregnant. She's probably hot as hell. Also, why does it matter that she's hispanic? I don't see how that detail is important."
58,"This is actually bullshit advice: steak houses don't rest their steaks for very long because it softens up the crust. And something like a ribeye is going to lose a bit of it's juices no matter what - rested versus non-rested steaks lose a similar amount. 

This is a pop-culture steak myth. Some steaks do need to be rested: flank and skirt steaks benefit. Traditionally high end steaks like ribeyes, NY strips, and porterhouses do NOT need to be rested.

67,"Yeah!!! DC is killing it!!! BvS is the best movie to date. Suicide Squad was awesome! So excited for Justice League. I love the experimenting of a shared universe, expected from the great minds from DC. Marvel is worst trash I have ever seen. Haven't seen one movie since they're so fucking bad."
68,"okay when one of the top posts of the day is the third year celebration of you erasing your future responsibility because you couldn't be arsed to use protection, that sounds like some shit straight out of a dystopian world.

70,"That's because gaming is an empty, unfulfilling past time. It's no better than playing slot machines. It only provides the occasional dopamine dump but no real pleasure. People who game hate gaming because it's just a sad little addiction."
71,"**Thank you for confirming my point. r/personalfinance is actually getting financial advice from people that defend that post!** NOBODY ever signs up for a credit card because they are feeling irresponsible. Especially when you're aiming  advice at 18 year olds (""Get a 850 credit score when you graduate!""). Ever wonder why something like 70% of college kids have huge credit debt when they get out of college? Because they were told ""oh you'll be fine, just be responsible?"" Sure, hey young kid that's never had to worry about buying food and living on his/her own and about to go to off to college to be in the hardest financial times under the pressures of college life. Clearly having a credit card is a great option for YOU! Are you sure you should listen to ""dont get a credit card"" from those suckers that think they are wise about financial advice (actual words) Get a credit card now and get a 850 credit score as soon as you graduate! **SAID NO SMART FINANCIAL ADVISOR EVER! ** edit: correction. ""Said no REAL financial advisor; the account manager at pyour bank doesn't count, he's the one that's SELLING you to become their future debt slave. You can say ""it's sound advice if your responsible"", well that's actually giving terrible advice in a very irresponsible way. That's like saying ""you can try heroin occasionally at 18, during your financially weakest point and not get addicted. Just as long as your RESPONSIBLE about it..."" just shut up, you shouldn't be involved in any finance discussion. "

73,"While I don't want to call you a liar, I have never believed this. Beer tastes like shit and no one would ever drink it if it didn't have alcohol. What you have is a positive association with the euphoria caused by consumption of alcohol. The only people that drink alcohol free beer are alcoholics trying to prove they can go without drinking.

Give kids any beverage, water, juice, soda, koolaid or even tea and they will all choose it over beer. Also, been to many AA meetings where people who have stopped drinking admit that beer and alcohol taste like total crap and it's just a lie to cover up being addicted to alcohol. No one will ever convince me that any really thinks that nasty tasting stuff actually tastes good."
