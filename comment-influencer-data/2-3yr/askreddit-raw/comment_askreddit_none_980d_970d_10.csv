8,"Why should they care? They weren't getting the money anyway, and they're allowed to disinvite people if they want."
9,"Masturbatory self congratulation.

Propaganda.

The self attribution fallacy.

The temporarily embarrassed millionaire phenomenon.

Oh and getting money from people into arms corporations."
10,Anybody who uses this many abbreviations is a piece of shit.
11,Not a prison guard but I saw a documentary cbs made were the inmates would throw feces and urine while the guards serve them food

16,"If he's playing something like CoD, that just makes him an asshole, not cool, especially in non-objective things like TDM. If you're talking something more realistic like Insurgency or ARMA, then that's cool."

No, smoking just makes you a suicidal person because you know how it can kill you."

Get your fucking HEAD out of your ASS"
22,"&gt; I think there are drawbacks to wind and solar that we don't know yet, but I am all for trying them at a large scale for energy diversity.

Yep, we won't be so high and mighty when we deplete the sun and wind."
23,"If being suicidal is a normal behaviour then what the fuck isn't?

If you're suicidal, you're mentally ill. End of. You're seriously an idiot if you think that's wrong."

30,"My bloodline is warrior DNA, sorry not sorry. I have one grandpa who would have killed that kid, and one who would have hid. 

One served in a war, one didn't. Some old people are courageous, some are cowards.... all the ones in the video had a clear shot at his back with him moving away and not looking. "
31,"Well she was probably right.  First time anal doesn't hurt, except for a little, whereas first time vaginal is very painful.  I mean not for everyone, but in general.  

Edit: wtf is with the downvotes?  For saying anal doesn't hurt?  Y'all doing it wrong if it does.  For saying first time vaginal does hurt?  For MANY women it does.  A lot.  It did for me.  Jerks."

37,"A person could say the same thing about Urban America, getto culture, and the romanticization of THAT...since it's the undisputed prime mover in pop culture these days. The lowest common denominator, personified for profit across the commercial spectrum...but your bias only sees rednecks. Got it."
38,"to be fair, I think you underestimate the lack of castles, beer, and white blue-eyed people in other places of the world. I was honestly shocked by how much beer and how many castles there were. But lol I can't stand Europe. At least the US criticizes itself."
39,"That faith is misplaced, *you* may not need to use weapons to defend your wat of life but others will.

Military power is the only power that matters in the end"
40,Not at all that I didn't find it funny?
41,embrace socialism...yuck. 
42,"&gt;she memorized how long to look at people in the face, then look away, and look back. 

That's freaking creepy.

Edit:

Sorry, folks. That is a pretty ugly thing to say. "

48,"When someone refers to a lady as ""phat"", that is an acronym for ""pussy, hips, ass and titties"" "
49,That's seriously the most autistic thing I've ever heard.
50,"No it works like that.  If I squeeze my pecs together it kinda looks like a pair of nice titties in the right light so I am definitely a chick, 100%."
51,"Swear.

If you do it way to often, that not only means that you lack proper manners, social skills and basic English skills, you also lack a vocabulary. "
52,"I wasn't ""baiting"" you, merely asking you a simple question. You're part of literally the most privileged class on Earth yet I'm willing to bet you still think Western women are an oppressed class and need ""equality,"" right? You're a feminist, all right. Living up to the thread itself. I won't waste anymore of your time."
53,"Infowars and tucker Carlson are the only outlets covering the Chicago kidnapping and torturing that occurred today.

Infowars not 100% accurate but it it's definitely a good source at times "
54,Straight males simply do not get off to gay porn.
55,"Whenever this topic comes up, I get lots of downvotes, but it needs to be said every time. Abortion. Plain and simple, outside of saving the mother's life or if the child has little chance of living, it should not be an option. Both the father (assuming he gave consent) and the mother should be charged with murder if they do not have a just cause for this.

Give free birth control, make it mandatory in health insurance to provide it, do whatever it takes to remove all justification for baby-killing, as we are far too civilized and moral to ever allow murder. Thank goodness it's happening less as alternatives to killing are being produced.

I'm otherwise a pretty Libertarian guy, but this I refuse to be anything less than fully adamant about. How can we call rape and adult murder evil if we allow abortion? Hypocrisy at its finest.  "
56,"No it isn't.

Perfectly fine question, if the answer is ""we can't"", then just say that. No reason for anybody to be uncomfortable about it.

Then again this is reddit and seemingly everybody here is socially crippled."
57,did not need a throwaway for such a boring shit
58,"To be fair, I wouldn't want to google 'vaginal discharge'."
59,"Isn't ""Jill"" just a reference to a person's hand...which is used for jacking off? Like Jack 'n Jill? Because the thumb and forefinger make a J, and the next 3 fingers are i-l-l. 

Edit:

Come on people.. you don't remember that shit??

dude 1:
""Jill is the only girlfriend you'll ever have""

dude 2:
""Jill..?""

dude 1:
""Haha yeah! Jill! Get it?
*demonstrates how the [fingers on a hand form the name ""Jill""](http://mybrainllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/palm2.jpg)*

It's like number 3 on Urban Dictionary after ""Jill is an awesome person"" and ""Jill is so amazing"" or some shit."
