"I was one on and off for years. Like any job, it's a mixed bag. Like any job, it gets old after a while. The big difference between it and a ""straight"" job is that you control everything, which also means that all the risks are on you to mitigate to the best of your ability. You pick who to meet and make an arrangement with, you set your hours, you get cash to do with as you please. That might all sound great, but it can be horrible if you don't have excellent street smarts and intuition. You HAVE to be hyper aware to do it safely. You will be alone with men who you don't know well, who feel like you owe them something (because you do if you want to get paid. This job is 100% paid companionship INCLUDING SEX in almost all cases). 


There's also some myth that sex work is unskilled. It's definitely not. Being a sugar baby takes a lot of natural and learned social abilities. You have to be able to play girlfriend to a wide variety of men, not to mention have some sexual abilities worth paying for. It's actually a pretty challenging job. 90% of it is being able to talk about anything, while making him feel like the center and king of your universe for those hours every week. That's not easy with someone who you would never probably date for free. It requires a lot of patience and intuitive people skills to do that every single week for a long time. 


That being said, it came very naturally to me and I never ended up in a bad situation. I enjoyed it while I enjoyed it, then I quit. Knowing when to get out and having a plan to do so is another important factor in being a sex worker. 

Edit: don't PM me saying I was a prostitute. That's not news to me hahaha. Sugar baby is just a kind of prostitute who provides a more girlfriend like experience. Also, prostitute isn't an insult. "
Penny on The Big Bang Theory. 
"When my family was homeless, people would give us t-shirts, pants, etc. But we couldn't afford underwear, so we didn't have it. For over a year. 

Once my dad got a job, he and mom took the whole family to buy underwear - every single one of us was so excited! It's such a silly thing, but it's stuck with me, and to this day wearing pretty, comfy panties is a luxury I treasure. 

Having nice undies means everything  is okay."
"Southeast US specific: pastel polo shirt, linen shorts, boating shoes, and either has straps attached to his sunglasses or he wears them upside on the back of his head.

 He is obsessed with some college football team (probably from a school he didn't go to). He loves beer, but only drinks one shitty brand (Coors, Miller, or bud) and believes it tastes better than the other shitty beers because it's ""colder.""

His name is probably Tyler or Brad and he played short stop in highschool. He's ""not racist"" but thinks that people of other ethnicities should stick to their part of the city.

He only dates girls named Brittany or Stephanie and they love taking selfies in front of his truck.

Edit: Obligatory thanks for the gold my friends! To answer some questions:

* I'm from Savannah, Georgia where this shit is an epidemic, but it's in every SE state to some degree.
* This post was obviously not meant to insult the shitty beer you love, but if you think there's a huge difference between Bud Light and Miller Lite, you're an idiot.
* I'm so sorry I forgot the Salt Life Decal!"
"Tried being a sugar baby through seekingarrangement.com. He flew me to New York, reminded me of Hank from Breaking Bad but grossed me out and admitted he was trying to build a harem. He sucked through his dentures constantly. To his credit, he acknowledged I was uncomfortable and bought a plane ticket for me to go home early.    "
"Wasn't Tinder, but OKCupid. The guys picture was 'meh'. I wasn't particularly attracted to his photo but I really liked his profile and it seemed we had a lot of similar interests, and I asked him out anyway since I know sometimes the attraction grows over time.

Hot damn. Turns out he just took bad fucking photos- he looked fucking good. Plus there was definitely a pheromone compatibility there somewhere because he had the most intoxicating natural body scent that always made me want to be closer. Fell head over heels damn fast. The relationship didn't work out though."
"The 20-something NYC basic boy: Pin rolled pants, messy hair, acts sensitive but treats tinder dates like dirt, immature, Warby Parker glasses, oatmealy professor sweater, trust fund, works in media, Muji notebooks, pretends to be super liberal and feminist but rages at any woman who criticizes him, spoilt in every way, feminine without being sensitive"
"There is no better thing to do after I step out of the shower after an orgasmic shampooing than to laugh over a salad. It completes me. It's a daily ritual. I cackle into the sunny void with my salad, in my white shorts to show that my legs are smooth shaved, that the self tanner is only on my legs, not my shorts and that my pad only leaks blue fluid. I unwind with my diet wine cooler and soak in the pure bliss of cleaning supply comercials that are made to look like a romance and the mind exploding excitement of Macy's weekend sales. After I finish my salad, I use my lady bic pens to arrange for a party with my gal pals where we all recline on the patio while getting a little *too* enthusiastic about our love for diet yogurt and individually wrapped chocolates. While our husbands all drink beer, watch Nascar and talk about the newest model of trucks on the market. Party all day, every day with salad. "
"All of the roommates in New Girl.  Good looking guys who are immediately big-brother protective of Jess while also thinking she's hot, who have a mysteriously high tolerance for her constant faux-awkward bullshit.

I guess the guys are all messed up enough to not exactly be fantasy material themselves, it's the whole roommate situation that feels like emotional porn for women."
"The whole idea that there's some secret key that ""women want"".  This leads to an attitude of, ""I did everything *right*, where's my sex?""  Women are lots of different people with many different desires. There is no ""what women want."""
"""She does have a very nice figure. I've said that if she weren't my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her"""
"Almost two decades here. I don't know if our relationship has changed, but something has. 

I've always been an unabashed goofball. Slapstick humor, puns, anything that'll get a laugh. Hubs was mostly the opposite. I don't think it's a good idea to take yourself so seriously all the time, but that was him, always afraid of looking the fool. While I do have dignity and self respect, I never minded looking silly. None of us are getting outta this alive, so we might as well laugh at ourselves, ya know?

Now he says I've broken him. He calls me up to tell me about silly stuff he did during the day. things he previously would've been embarrassed about he now can't wait to share. He makes dumb jokes and poses for stupid pictures with me. We have random days where we both talk in bad Aussie accents or pretend we're crew members of Enterprise. We have contests for who can make the best/worst joke and sing billy Joel and queen duets (even thought neither of us can carry a tune in a bucket) Our kids are embarrassed sometimes, but that only makes it more fun. "
As someone with a couple of physics degrees (bachelor's and Master's) everything about that show just makes me angry. I hate it so very much. 
"I'm from India. We're a relatively liberal society in big cities - women work, go out at night, drive, etc etc. I've travelled a bit for work to the West.
However, when I visited Thailand the matriarchal society suprised me. There are more women heading to work during peak office hours. They all hold important managerial positions and ratio of women to men at the work place is relatively higher. Women want to look and dress feminine. They have soft toys and pink pillows at the work place they clutch and walk around. I've spent most of my career trying to be seen as a colleague rather than as a woman - but these woman are comfortable and flaunt being female. Infact, even the men want to look more like women - they wear softer colors, more make up - eyeliner, lipstick, facepowder. 
While growing up, I always thought the West was more open to women, clearly Thailand is a lot more female lead society."

"This is anecdotal but I know it's representative of a bigger problem overall. My daughter is a chess genius, and if I had a dollar for every time some dad berated their son for ""losing to a GIRL!"" I could buy an island and retire to it. Like, I didn't realise the pieces moved differently depending on what chromosomes you had."
"Oh man, this is one of my favorite petty vengeance stories ever. When I was a junior I lived with three guys in a 3 bed apt (two shared a room). We were all gamers, but apparently *I* was the only one who had any semblance of respect for the noise that gaming can produce. I always wore headphones and spoke (on voice chats) at a normal volume, while my roommates had no volume control and blasted their speakers. One would consistently call out 'BOOM, HEADSHOT!' another played his bass guitar (plugged in) at all hours of the night. Our neighbors complained about them regularly, but I just wore earplugs or headphones to drown out the noise. 

But one day while trying to study during one of their gaming sessions, I turned on my space heater to warm up and suddenly it caused a power outage from too much power draw. The entire apartment lost power, their computers shut down and for a brief, glorious moment the apartment was silent. 

I didn't abuse this newfound power, but every once in a while when they were particularly loud, the power would suddenly, mysteriously shut off for like 20 seconds, right in the middle of a particularly exciting match or fight and completely ruin it for them, such a shame...."
"I met a guy whose photos made him look like a rugby player - tall, broad, big but in a strong muscular kind of way. Nope. Apparently he was just really good with angles and in real life he was a couple of inches shorter than me and about 50lbs overweight. I wasn't even a little bit attracted to him (for some personality-related reasons too) and bailed after the first date. 

He proceeded to hound me with texts and calls for the next year, even after I blocked his number. This was probably four years ago and just the other week he tried to add me on Facebook. I'm very much of the opinion that 'if someone has to mislead you in to dating them then they're probably a bit off' and he's my proof."

Eating out of the garbage never hurt my ego, but secretly eating someone I knew's garbage did."

"Just yesterday, I came across a video about the [Born Sexy Yesterday](https://youtu.be/0thpEyEwi80) trope. Basically, a huge number of characters are male fantasies but they have the intelligence/nativity/innocence of a child, in the body of a sexy woman - eg. An infantilised, manic pixie dream girl type character who is 'other' to this world. (An alien, mermaid, cartoon princess, robot, created in a lab, etc). 

Is always the romantic prop for the shlub male character who is disenfranchised from the world. There is nothing special about him but the woman doesn't know any better and ends up being with him. 

She isn't aware of her sex appeal and therefore had a moment is disrobing at some point. 

Think: The Fifth Element, Tron reboot, Born Yesterday, Splash, Enchanted, etc. 

Basically summed up as man pairs with sexy baby who he gets to be the big brave protector for. "
"I hate when fictional women are either 100% super traditionally feminine all the time or they completely reject all things that would be considered feminine. Every woman I know has a wide variety of interests. Yes, I like makeup and getting dressed up. I also enjoy camping and punk rock shows. It doesn't have to be one or the other extreme!"
"That I don't have to clean my plate and can stop eating when I'm full. Also knowing what a proper portion size should look like. Using salad plates instead of the larger, dinner ones and a food scale are really helping me. "
"The way women think about themselves. Like, okay, women do not all think the same way of course, but there's still this weird ""otherness"" and male gaze attached to the internal monologue and narration of female characters that I just find laughable. Not just in the ""my breasts boobily boobed"" way, but overfocus on gender, performance of femininity, and what the author assumes or wants to believe about women. I mean...when I do things, I am generally not a woman doing womanly things in a special womanly way - to me, I'm just a person doing a thing and I happen to be a woman also. I do not sit around thinking how womanly I am or am not. I do not ""stretch my lithe body"" because that is not how I view myself - I am just having a stretch. I don't wriggle into a risqué size 2 dress - I put my frock on. I don't giggle coquettishly - I laugh. I do not languidly run my hands across my thighs when I shower - I wash. And so on.

Yes, it's a lot less sexy and florid that way. Being a regular person going about their day-to-day life generally isn't all that sexy. Even if you're writing fantasy, I really doubt a character needs to be ~womaning~ her way through everything."
"It's astounding how many people on Reddit genuinely believe women are instantly attracted to money. I mean naturally financial stability is important, but I swear people think women are golddiggers by nature.

Like the other day, there was a question on AW: ""How would you feel about a guy that is socially awkward BUT has a lot of money?""

Or the eternal ""her boyfriend is ugly so he must be *loaded*""-trope.

Like, no dude. That's not how it works. That's not how any of this works!"

"Was in Vancouver in the early 90's, hanging out with some of my gay friends when they met up with this recently arrived Arab guy who turned out was super gay, had obviously been in the closet his whole life and never in a million years imagined that there was anywhere where gay men could just go be gay. It was almost like watching a Husky experience snow for the first time. "
"Someone already mentioned ""babysitting"". That's a big one for me too. 

I know the phrase that pretty much ended a friendship was when a guy told me husband ""man, you have to encourage nursing, don't let her pump. [Wife] only nurses and it's great because I never have to get up at night! Kid cries and you just hand her off to to the boob"". I was mad, my husband still brings up how disgusted he is over that attitude. "
"Former sugar baby here! 

It's something I did for a few months, and it was a great way to help me out of a difficult financial situation. 

To start off, before any sugar relationship starts, there is usually a platonic meet and greet over coffee/dinner/drinks so both parties can see if they actually like each other. Out of every 3 meet and greets I went to I probably only saw 1 again. There's no sex and usually no money is exchanged (although I have been given money at meet and greets a few times). Sometimes you will also discuss allowance at the meet and greet, but you can also do this before or after. 

Allowance is always agreed upon before any actual dates, and it can either be a monthly or weekly amount, or pay per meet (PPM). I used to always do PPM. 

Once that's all established, you start having dates with your sugar daddy. These can be anything from hotel meetups for just sex, to going to an art show, dinner, and drinks, before heading back to his place for sex. It's never said out loud but sex is absolutely expected. 

In my experience, most guys who are sugar daddies are very busy business men who don't have the time or energy to sustain a real relationship. The money ensures that everything will go smoothly, and they still get a genuine (or what I make seem to be genuine) emotional, fun, and intimate experience. 

I enjoyed sugaring when I did it, because it was a good way for me to make money, while still being in control of who I spent time with. 

/r/sugarlifestyleforum is the subreddit for all this stuff and it's a really interesting insight into that community. 

I'm happy to answer any questions!

"It's happened to me a few times. I tend to fake a headache and excuse myself, then I ghost them. One time though I'd been talking to a guy for months and months. I wasn't really attracted to him physically but he was incredibly nice and we had a lot in common. i was going through a bad divorce and my ex husband was threatening my life. My ""friend"" invited me to come to his farm to hide out and relax for a weekend. I was scared and lost so I figured what the hell. I showed up at his door at 1am. He was drop dead gorgeous, I couldn't believe how attracted I was to him.

That was just over a year ago. My ex was charged, and I finally got orders of protection for me and my kids. I still haven't left the farm. When people ask if we're going to get married we say we are still on our first date, longest Tinder date ever. 

He is amazing and I can honestly say I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for him and his family taking us in."

"Preoccupation with their breasts, it just comes off as really weird. "
"Wasn't Tinder, was okcupid. He only had a couple pics but was kind of cute. We  chatted very briefly and made a lunch date.  He looked so different that if he hadn't said my name I would have still been looking down the street. He was about 10-15 year older than the pics for starters  Terrible  clothes, so terrible first impression. He went from having full head of hair in pics, to very progressed balding. If your bald, be bald! Bear in mind I was 25 thinking I was going out with another 25 year old, not 40!

Anyway, after we greet he said ""ello, ello!"" in this bad cockney accent (we're in Philadelphia and both Americans, mind you). He proceeded to use the accent off and on throughout lunch. Even ordered his food in it! And said shit like, ""jolly good."" If he was less weird I could get past the physical difference. I was polite though and we went to a movie after. Never saw him again. "

"Living in an apartment generally makes me feel safe, because rationally speaking someone would have to make it past the front desk security (that has cameras), choose to go all the way up to my floor, choose my apartment at the very end of the hall, and then somehow get through the locked door without anyone intervening.

As a result, it's super unlikely that I'd be the victim of a crime in my home. I think I'd feel a bit more nervous if I had a ground floor apartment or a stand alone house. "

The first time I met his extended family, in a small town in Minnesota, I was amazed by everybody sitting around in the living room in *complete and utter silence.* Nobody was talking. The TV was on, very quietly, and there were like seven people stuffed into this sitting room and nobody was saying a damn thing. I asked my fiance about it later and he told me that's just what they do when they have family gatherings. No gossip, no catching up, no debates or arguments. Just silence.

So. Weird."
"There was a point at which I could not afford toilet paper.  For about a year, I used a water bottle to rinse myself off after using the toilet. I had two rolls of toilet paper which I reserved for guests and any unforeseeable emergency. They lasted the entire year.

I would bring an old yogurt container to work with me, and at the end of the day after everyone was finished drinking coffee, I'd pour the left over coffee from the pot into my container. Next morning I'd heat it up on the stove.  My boss was okay with it because I'd also clean out the coffee pot and filter basket.

A friend's mom had given him a 50 lb bag of beans and a 50 lb bag of rice. He never even opened either of them. When he moved, he gave them to me! Those bags of rice and beans saved me so much money. I lived on rice and beans most of the way through college and I was able to budget $5 per week for food."

"When I young, right after my parents divorced, we were really poor. I remember my mom had to go to the food bank but her car wasn't working. It was the middle of winter and super cold (Canada). But my mom being the best mom went out into the cold and walked to the food bank. How did she bring all the food home? She brought a sled and used the sled to bring food home. "
"I ate McDonalds every day pretty much for my entire life through middle and high school. My mom worked there and it was often the only food she could afford. I suspect now that she saved her free meal from her break and gave it to me. I would often not eat all of it and she would finish it when I said I was done. That and pizza rolls were pretty much my only food for a very, very long time."
"*Women want to date jerks.* Not true at all. 

*Women only like rich guys.* No, I just don't want to have to support my man financially. He should be able to take care of himself. Like I do. 

Also, what is with the whole 9+ inch penis thing? Sure, I would try to make it work with someone I care about but in general...YIKES! Average is perfect. Thanks! Not sure why some men think women are looking for painful (PIV) sex.

"We met up at 14h on a Saturday in summer on a well-visited Park. 

We then just sat in the meadow and talked. It took me 2 minutes to realise that he was ""different"" (sorry, I don't know how to express myself any better).  But he was sweet and nice and I didn't want to be mean and leave. I mean, it's not his fault, right?


We then went for burgers and headed after that towards the centre of the city. 
He asked if we could meet up with some of his friends (he was very nervous), so we did. 


We were going for drinks the four of us. And  then again food in the evening. 


Later that night we all went to to play billiard in a bar until I left at 1am. 
We behaved pretty ""couply"" the whole day. He hold my hand etc hugged me a lot. 

He brought me to the train station and kissed my cheek goodbye when I left. 
We said ""let's do this again"" but neither of us contacted the other again. 
I mean I wasn't interested :-/ but I don't know, I guess I wanted to give him a nice date? I was relieved he didn't contact me anymore actually, because I wouldn't have known what to do.

"I'm an escort who has done a little bit of sugaring here and there. I personally find Seeking Arrangement to be full of salt daddies (men who really don't have enough excess funds to be maintaining the lavish lifestyle they seek). I've had much greater success through other means, such as discussing arrangements with pre-existing clients, IRL chance meetings or through internet forums. 

To concur with the other ladies, sex is expected. The idea that escorting and sugaring is primarily about talking and drinking champagne is very naive. While companionship and the ability to navigate social situations is incredibly important to succeed as a sugar baby, I do wish people would stop downplaying the sexual element of sex work. 

There is nothing wrong with paying for sex and companionship. For many business minded men it makes more sense to seek a lovely girl who comes willingly to your hotel room/house fully prepared to have sex in nice lingerie, than spend all your time and money wining and dining uninterested women. I am more turned on by humour and personality and physical appearance, so it very much works for me.

"Every morning after I shower and towel dry, I like to point the hair dryer at my body to *really* get dry, especially in the cracks that are harder to get dry like armpits, underboob, groin, and feet.

So I'm standing with my legs apart, blow drying my buttcrack, when I see a blur of something stringy and red fly across the room and hit the wall. Then more of it. Oh god, it's fucking menstrual blood and I am fucking blow drying it across my bathroom.

I turned the dryer off and stood there in shock, surveying the damage. There were drops of it on the toilet, behind the toilet, on the base of the sink pedestal, on the outside of the trash can, on the wall of course, and on the bathmat directly below me that I was standing on.

I let out some kind of wail, and my boyfriend came in to see what was up. He laughed in disgust and promptly got the fuck out of there."
"I have to disagree with this one, because Titus is so deeply flawed. The stereotypical ""Gay BFF"" would be extra supportive in addition to being extra gay - he would give lots of complements and take her shopping and validate her feelings.

Plus she doesn't know about GayBFF tropes, presumably, so she doesn't ask that behavior of him. "

"I find it kind of odd. I can understand women only gyms or classes, but a movie? People don't talk during movies. People are saying that there wouldn't be issues with male only classes, but I would definitely have an issues for a male only screening of an action movie. That's kind of bizarre. "
"Not sure it counts, but my tinder date was very different from what I expected but not physically.

"In a lot of cases in my experience animated people are not very photogenic, because 1) in candids they're more likely to be in the middle of a weird expression, and 2) for posed shots they're not used to holding still."
"Online dating I've experienced it. 

The weirdest was the guy with the ~10 year old picture and many inches exaggerated height. I was like ""OK, maybe he is nice"". 

Then early on the first date he says he was surprised I was even prettier in real life, and: ""You won't believe how many women post old pictures or pictures that are not representative. I just walk away when that happens.""

"I lived with two roommates in university, and the guy we lived with refused to clean anything. He would walk into the house, take off his shoes as he walked, drop his coat behind him, throw his backpack/books/papers onto the couch and grab food from the kitchen and then go upstairs to his room - leaving a trail of items behind him.

We didn't want to clean up after him, but we also didn't want to live in a mess. So we made a Brad Box. Every time we found something of his strewn about the house, we dumped it in the box. He got pissed when that started to include his dishes (luckily we didn't share) and homework."

"The 'redeemed misogynist' trope (not to be confused with the 'bad boy with the heart of gold') Fifty Shades of Grey is a good example of the redeemed misogynist... I cannot for the life of me understand why this type of character is appealing to women.... he basically only likes her because she looks like his mother and that's why he's into BDSM as a fantasy about hurting his mother... I can't even. 

Any character that is violent towards women but he's the love interest and his love for said girl changes him profoundly and he decides to be 'better' for her. But it could be argued that this type of character is also a male fulfillment fantasy but it is accepted by women as a desirable trope. "
"Had a dad show up to the last parent conference of the year after not even knowing he existed all year. Dude is irritated because his kid gets ""picked on"" (he's a bully, and I talk to Mom often).

"I don't know if it's universal, but what I think of as basic is a lack of hobbies outside of video games and television. I meet so many young guys who can't hold a conversation about anything other than games or Rick and Morty. Also sneakers/trainers/tennis shoes with every non-formal outfit. "
"The vast majority of my interactions with men are good or great or just normal and unremarkable. My SO, my best friend, my regular friends, my dad, my colleagues, people I interact with... almost always good or just normal. 

However, in the spirit of the question (an opposite to creepy interactions with strangers) -- some years ago I was on a work trip to a small rural city. One night at about 11 p.m. I got back to my hotel after grabbing food, and walked into the elevator by the lobby. As I entered the hotel, I could hear two large men talking loudly behind me. 

There was nobody else around in the lobby at all; the night desk staff must have been off somewhere, the place was really empty. So I took a quick look over my shoulder just to keep an eye on the men. You know, just keeping alert of my surroundings.

The two men walked up to the open elevator door, carrying a case of beer; one older, pretty grizzled-lookin' man with a long grey beard, and a younger one that might have been his grandson. 

And the older man stopped, and stopped the younger man from stepping forward. ""Excuse me, miss,"" the older man said. ""Is it okay if we ride this elevator with you?"" I was so surprised but stammered out a ""yes of course,"" and he ducked his head politely and said ""thank you very much.""

It was just such a gentlemanly and kind thing, it melted my heart. He certainly didn't have to ask my permission. But clearly, somewhere down the line he had learned that it can be anxious for women to be in an isolated space with unknown men, and that it's compassionate to make that tiny bit of effort to put her at ease. 

I was just so impressed by that thoughtfulness and good manners, and especially that he was modelling it for the younger man with him. "
"Family money.   


Money sounds great right? Until you're an adult and you have to ask for it because you've never had to work. I never thought I'd grow to hate the idea of dating a man with money but it turned out he didn't have any freedom at all. He scoffed at minimum wage but had to ask for gas money. "

"Don't ever compromise your safety -- even to avoid appearing rude or unfriendly -- if your gut instinct tells you it's a sketchy situation. Good people will understand, and even if they don't, who gives a shit, safety is more important.

"I don't know how to word this but I guess the biggest culture shock from moving from Ireland to Australia is how ""un-nosey"" Australians are. Back home in Ireland, people pry themselves into everything. Irish people are always asking questions both personal and impersonal and Australians just don't care. I like their apathy in one way but it can be a bit cold and unfriendly in other ways since I am not used to it. Take for example when I am with my husband and we meet someone who he knows and I don't. If he doesn't introduce me then no one will ask who I am. Back home the first thing anyone would say to me if they didn't know my husband would be ""who's this?"" It is annoying to be constantly asked invasive questions but I do miss it because it just seems more friendly and caring to me because it's how I have been raised. "

"I was on the elliptical at the gym I used to go to. It was a very small community college gym - 3 treadmills, an elliptical, a bike, and one TV. I was the only person working out and there was a Yankees game on the TV. I love the Yankees - even spent my honeymoon at the Baseball Hall of Fame. So I was actually *watching* the game. A guy walked in and asked if he could change the station. I said no, I'm watching the game. He then said ""yeah, right"". I said ""I'm a Yankees fan"". He made a noise like ""pfft"" and said ""ok, then name off all the players"". I said ok and started naming off my favorites first - he interrupted me and said ""those are just the *popular* players"" and walked away."

"I mean, I did sex work, but I wouldn't consider that a low.

I suppose my low would be the time that I talked one of my bosses into giving me a gigantic can of baked beans. Like, bigger than any can of beans I'd seen before or since. I googled it and Wal-Mart sells a 117 oz can of baked beans, but I think it might have been bigger than that.

Anyway, so my boss had this can of beans she didn't want and I was like ""No give it to me, I can eat that many beans.""

And I took it home and literally ate nothing but beans every day for a week, determined to conquer that can, but I did not succeed, the beans went bad before I could finish them.

I also once got a bunch of free seafood from the same boss because it was very badly freezerburned and I was like ""Yeah, is food, don't care."" and made it anyway and just dumped tarter sauce on it to mask the taste. This was like, fancy-ass salmon from Whole Foods but I gave no fucks."

"And those who feel attracted to superficial people tend to be very superficial themselves, that's why so many rich men and women have trophy husbands/wives, they're perfect for each other.

My point is, if *all* the women you meet are golddiggers then you should take a hard look at yourself cause there's a reason why you're attracting that kind of people.

I also think many people go with the ""women want money"" stereotype cause it simplifies their issue of lack of success with women, it's not that we're not compatible or she doesn't find me attractive or I'm a mess or I lack social skills... no, it's those damn women who are wrong!

"Story time:

I've read on askmen many times that the guys haven't gotten a compliment in years. So, I decided to go out of my way to make some random people feel better. Free and fun for everyone involved, right?

I passed by a guy on my way to a picnic who wore a shirt from a band I liked. I said ""Hey, great shirt!"" as I passed by.  He thanked me, I went on to grab some beers from a shop nearby. When I got out, he was waiting for me. Asked me for my number, asked me to hang out with his friends who sat a few meters in the back. I declined, since my friend was waiting for me. He asked if he could join us. I declined again, since my friend was going through some stuff and needed my help. 

He got pissed. Asked why I ""chatted him up"" if I didn't indented to follow through with it. I, increasingly nervous, told him that just liked his shirt and went to the picnic place to sit down with my friend.

He followed me. Sat on a bench nearby and kept staring at me angrily for the next three hours from a distance. His friends came to him from time to time and tried to convince him to come back. He stayed.

When it was time to go home, I asked my friend's boyfriend to come to the train with me, as I was feeling increasingly unsafe. He got up as well, followed us and proceeded to stare at me wide-eyed and pissed through the train window. No idea what he would have done if I went alone. There was so much rage and frustration in his eyes.

I won't compliment stranger's bandshirts anytime soon."

"Been with my bloke for 10 and a half years (got together at 19). I think the biggest difference is how we fight. For about the first 5 years our arguments escalated fast and raged on for hours. We are both very stubborn. Took quite a long time to learn contrition doesn't mean losing. Backing down when you really don't want to is still less painful than the nasty things you'll eventually say/hear if you keep going.

We've had various switchovers of who's leading/earning more/happier/more stressed etc. Glad to say we seem to do well in whichever scenario, which hopefully bodes well for when we start a family. 

Sex has stayed really good for a decade which I'm pretty thrilled about. We've kept it a priority which I think really helps. 

Weirdly I think we've become more alike (we're fundamentally pretty different people) But a decade together kinda makes your traits bleed into each other. "

"Not geographic culture shock, but last year I did some work through a temp agency who ended up placing me in the business office of a school for people who are deaf. I know some very very basic sign language (hi, how are you, where's the bathroom, etc) but I'm no where near fluent and my signing is pretty clunky when I actually attempt to converse. But they placed me there anyway since I was mostly doing filing and data entry. 

Y'all, I did not anticipate how much culture shock I would experience the second I set foot on that campus. Suddenly *I* was the one who was ""different"". Suddenly *I* was the one who was not easily able to communicate with the people around me. Suddenly *I* was the one living in a world that was built to accommodate a group of people that didn't include me. It was such a mindf**k to enter the campus and try to flip the mental switch that turns off my dependency on communicating through sound, and it didn't always work (someone holds the door open for me, I say ""thank you"" out loud, I realize they can't hear me, I say ""oh, sorry.."" out loud, I finally stop trying to talk and just sign ""thank you"" and scurry away embarrassedly). 

And it was mind-blowing to go through a regular work day and realize how many things have to change when the students and a lot of the employees can't hear. The intercom to buzz into the building had a video call feature. The phones and fire alarm incorporated flashing lights in addition to the usual ringing sound. The cubicles in office had windows every few feet so coworkers could sign to each other.  I thought it was a little annoying at first that just driving from the parking lot where I parked to the main road involved (no lie) FIVE stop signs and NINE speed bumps, but then I realized ""oh, that's right, they want you to do 3 mph because there's at least a hundred little kids on this campus WHO CANT HEAR CARS COMING"""
"Cut my finger slightly peeling vegetables. Didn't have an first aid supplies around so I rinsed it off and moved on. Next day my finger was red and a bit swollen so I dug out some antibacterial and a band-aid. Had that on about an hour before I took it off because it was making it hard to type.

Two days later, my finger is still red and swollen to the point it won't bend. Rest of my hand was also getting puffy. It was a Saturday so I couldn't see my PCP and had to go to Urgent Care.

Doc at the clinic walks in the room, listens to my story (cut my finger with a vegetable peeler, hand is red and swollen) and tells me its probably an allergic reaction. ""To what?"" ""Latex, probably, if you put a band-aid on it.""

Told her I only had it bandaged briefly, it was already swollen, and also I need to know if I'm allergic to latex seeing as I use condoms as my primary birth control method.

I argued with her enough that she wrote me a 5-day course of antibiotics, but also an antihistamine cream that I should put on twice a day.

Did as instructed for 5 days - used both the cream and the antibiotic. After I finished the pills, my finger was still very swollen, so I called my PCP. He became alarmed and had me come in **immediately**.

As I suspected, it was an infection, not an allergy. Not only that, but the other doc had given me an *incomplete* course of the antibiotic she prescribed, AND the antihistamine cream was an immune suppressant (which I didn't realize at the time, but of course it is). 

My PCP actually wanted me to file a complaint on the Urgent Care clinic because if I'd just followed the doc's instructions and left it alone I could have easily wound up with a severe, possibly antibiotic-resistant infection.  "
"Dana Scully from X-Files. Just kidding, she's awesome.

"I had a roommate who didn't bring any of her own dishes/cookware into the apartment. I told her I had no problem with her using mine, so long as she cleaned up after herself. Well, she didn't. She would leave my dishes, covered in food, all over the apartment. She didn't even stay there most nights; would just pop in, shower, change clothes and leave again. 

So after 2 weeks of walking past the same half-empty mug (my favorite mug) of green tea in the living room, I had had enough. I had a couple of empty big Rubbermaid tubs, so I washed all of my dishes, and loaded them all into the tubs. All of the cups, plates, bowls, pots and pans, silverware -- all of it. I slid them into my bedroom and closed the door.

She didn't say a word to me the next time she came home. Then she didn't pay her half of the bills, so I told her she has a week to gtfo. She accused me of abusing my cat (because I slept over at my boyfriend's one night?) and being a drunk (because I told her and her friends to ask before they drank my vodka in the freezer.) 

And that's only the half of it.  "
"Pay attention to who your guy friends interrupt or speak over in mixed company.

"I did online arrangements similar to Sugaring in college. I exclusively offered ""Online Girlfriend Experiences"" where a person would pay me to act like his girlfriend online, including sexing, but without my face in any photos.

While I don't want to do it again, it was probably one of my favorite jobs. The money was fantastic and I had complete control over whoever I worked with. If they were being rude, I could end the arrangement. 

Despite a hard rule of not showing my face and other safety measures, a lot of guys would open up to me, tell me about their life, and send nonsexual pictures of themselves. My average client was generally only slightly overweight, in their later 20s to early 30s, average looking, and a little socially awkward. There's a misconception that only men who are very unattractive or old pay for these things. I had my fair share of men who were divorced, married, and/or conventionally good looking. Generally, they were either too busy or too shy to maintain a real relationship. Most men were just lonely. 

Most of my clients were very kind and interested in getting to know me and my personality. As someone else stated, sex work isn't unskilled. You have to have people skills rivaling a therapist and sexual skills rivaling a pornstar. 

Of course, you occasionally have the bad eggs. One of the creepiest men I worked with was a very good looking married man with young children. He also liked to send me nonsexual pictures of his wife behind her back at the grocery store, driving, etc. Basically, he got off on talking to me while spending time with his wife. Eventually, this creeped me out enough to end it. "

"Your beans and rice story reminds me of something I did, not at my poorest point but a few years later - struggling but no longer struggling to eat.

I was living in Austin and my friends and I would use SXSW to hit up free parties that had free drinks and/or food. We went to one party sponsored by some app that had free burgers and cheap beer, and they were also giving out these codes for the app.

Well, the app turned out to be one of those ""answer surveys to earn gift cards"" things and the codes were for free points. People had been throwing them away so I scooped a bunch off the ground and got extras from friends and wound up having $25 in points in the app. 

I traded it in for an Amazon gift card, and this was right after Amazon first started selling food. I bought like 15 lbs of brown rice, and 5 lbs of whole wheat spaghetti and didn't run out of the last of the rice until 3 years later."

"I have complicated feelings about it.  My dad is Chinese and my mother is Italian, but both families have been here for many generations and so I'm very culturally American.  When I was younger I would just tell people who asked that I was Italian in order to direct the conversation in a not-annoying direction.  My mother identifies me as white and I've identified myself that way in the past.  I looked a little more Asian as a child, but as an adult I am increasingly/exclusively white-passing (my Chinese classmates actually asked me who the Chinese people in my family picture were).

I've become a little more aware of how identifying as white when you're half is a non-neutral decision, so I'm working on that.  I feel kind of lost about it a lot of the time though--I don't feel like I have a robust ""POC"" identity because I am not treated like a person of color, and I don't have any cultural connection to my Chinese heritage.  I've also received a fair amount of pushback from family about it."
I think the reason *so many* women love Scully and often other female detectives is that they're some of the very few characters on TV *ever* that aren't male fantasies.

A low for me was being turned down to donate eggs because of being underweight and having low blood pressure at the time. It was depressing knowing I wasn't even healthy enough to do that.

"If I am nice to you while I am at my job, whether it's a barista smiling at a customer/calling them by name, being a helpful co-worker, etc. I am not flirting with you. Especially in customer service jobs where I am required to be nice to the customer/my pay is based on it. Please don't take advantage of the situation and make me uncomfortable by hitting on my while I am working.

Of course, this is a general rule. If a girl at work is actively telling you that you should go on a date, that's flirting. But so many guys assume that the cheerfulness is for /them specifically/ and not required/shown to all customers. And especially in lower level situations, turning someone down could lead to a negative complaint and being fired. I think not a lot of guys are aware of that power differential. 

There was actually a coffee shop chain that had its baristas call all their customers by their first name (based off their credit card) and they had to stop because they had so many complaints from their female baristas being harassed by customers. 

Sorry if this seems rant-y, I actually love a good flirt session in the wild, but when I'm at work I always feel super cornered by aggressive come-ons like ""do you know how beautiful you are?"" etc. "

"When my cousin committed suicide, my family flew in to go to the funeral and provide a little comfort and distraction to my aunt and uncle for a couple days.  I spent most of it in the basement with my uncle, lifting weights and talking about his old powerlifting days and the competitions I've been entering lately.

The next morning at breakfast, my uncle realized he hadn't picked pallbearers yet and started freaking out.  My family volunteered to do it and he felt better.

As we were in the church with them waiting, the priest walked up to me and said, ""I'm sorry you can't be a pallbearer.  The casket has to actually be carried into church and it's really heavy.""  I said ""I'm actually a competitive powerlifter.  I'll have no problem with it.""  He said ""All the same, it's really heavy.  I've gotta ask you not to.""  I didn't want to make a fuss about it so I let it go.  I went to talk to my dad about it, and discovered that the priest hadn't asked him not to do it at all.  He had to chase him down to find a replacement.  My dad walks with a cane.

My poor uncle had to find a bunch of men last minute to do it.  My cousin's casket was carried into the building by coworkers who had showed up straight from work in their business casual.  They found out he had died when he didn't show up to work that morning.

It was just, this huge distraction, on this day of grief and mourning.  And I hated feeling pissed off about blatant sexism on this day that had nothing to do with that."
"Years ago I did one semester in the UK, and most of my fellow students were foreigners too.

Half-way through I was in an accident, and ended up in hospital a couple hours away from where I studied. I came to remember I'd agreed to go to a soccer game the next day with some of the Italian boys in my class, so I called one of them up and told him I wouldn't be able to make it. I explained briefly what had happened and then we hung up.

Hours later there was a ruckus in the ward, and it turned out all four of the guys were there. They'd gone to where I lived, almost threatened my landlord to let them in, gathered up a bag of my clothes and books and music, taken the train down to this remote town and convinced the nurses to let them in despite it not being visiting hours.

I was so touched! I didn't even know them that well! "
"I was on Tinder and matched with this dude. We talked a bit and he seemed nice so we exchanged phone numbers and continued to talk on WhatsApp. He said he used to be a police officer but now working as a tutor for English course. That time I had some questions about harassment so he asked me out for dinner so we could discuss it further. 

I agreed and he picked me up but very very late. I wasn't mind because I wasn't in hurry, but definitely hungry. After meeting him in person I realised we didn't click as much as we were on WhatsApp, but the purpose of the meeting was to discuss harassment anyway so I ignored it. 

We arrived and waited for dinner. We finally discussed the harassment issue which I found useful. During dinner I excused myself to the loo, and he offered to go with me. I said no need and he said he brought some condoms with him in case I want to be fucked in the loo. I looked at him with my wtf face, went to the loo and ordered uber. I went back and paid my meal and said I needed to go home. Again he said he wanted to fuck me in the loo and I just left. "
"At my college graduation dinner celebration, my uncle told me it was nice I had my degree, but I better have my boyfriend ""put a ring on it"" soon so I could quit my job (that I hadn't even started yet, but was very excited about). His wife is a stay-at-home mom, and he smirkingly said, ""Not working, that's the dream, right?"" in a tone that was very clearly meaning ""for you *ladies*.""

Again, this was at a party to celebrate my graduation from college. He had nothing to say about my academic accomplishments or career prospects, just the likelihood of me getting married soon. "

"She was about 30ish or so pounds heavier than her picture. 

We had a really good time, and ended up dating for about half a year. 

But in hindsight, I kinda wish there was no second date. A lie on the dating profile is indicative of lies elsewhere - you just don't know when and where they'll crop up. 

For example: she had told me, before we met, that she rarely smoked and could leave it for days and be fine. I learned that that wasn't the case and she was actually a smoker. 

She had also told me she was a vegetarian and liked to keep active. What this actually meant was, yes, she was a vegetarian, but didn't eat well (or regularly) and did nothing more active than walk to and from work. 

Beware if they don't match their profile exactly. The truth always comes out eventually. "

I also have a samurai sword under my bed and hanging on the coat rack. They aren't sharp but they are heavy and long and might make people think I'm the kind of crazy they don't want to deal with."

"People started noticing my personality.

Prior, my coredefining features were, apparently, that I was fat and very busty. Conversations with women revolved around it, people accused anyone I spoke to of only speaking to me because of my breasts. People would describe me to others not by my personality but by my body. ""Oh, awallpapergirl? She's Sherri's best friend. Big girl. Huge tits."" I felt invisible. 

When I lost weight I suddenly was more than a body*. I cried in the bathroom at work when I heard someone describe me as, ""you know, the really smiley one!"" 

I lost weight and suddenly I was more than my figure. I'm built very Jessica Rabbit-y now, but somehow my sexuality these days is a sidenote. I'm allowed to be a person. "

"I think the secret to getting laid well and often is being emotionally forthcoming and available. Especially in a relationship. Women need to feel safe to have sex with you.

"I am so annoyed at the number of dudes I've known that have forced me into the awkward ""Um, no, it's incredibly rude for you to wear that to this event.""

As in, no, you can't wear your cargo shorts to this wedding. You can't wear your baseball cap in church. You need to not wear dirty jeans with holes if you're going to my work Christmas party at a cocktail lounge. You can't wear your ""cool"" sports shirt to a Michelin-starred restaurants. You're not being fun and youthful, you're being a childish dirtbag. 

This conversation is what we mean when we say women are doing the emotional labor. We have to correctly interpret the invitation, setting, and time of day, and figure out what to wear. Now we have to break it to you that you can't wear your comfy outfit in a way that won't make you have a shitfit. Not acceptable.

And it's not just boyfriends - it's guy friends, brothers (who finally got smart), etc."

But it's really gonna be when I was in the military and I was on a cane from an injury, and all the guys in the unit started laughing and saying that I could run away if they all decided to gang bang me, and I felt I couldn't say anything because the only thing worse than being subjected to constant rape jokes is being the person who reported rape jokes to the EO officer, so I just dealt with it.

"You're correct! Women in Thailand are far from the Asian submissive stereotype, they're practical, hardworking and feminine too. That said, the situation is more complicated than that 
Edit: Thailand is still a patriarchal society but it's not as in your face as other countries. There are still rather distinct gender roles and often a huge amount of ignorance regarding issues like rape.
 
For example, the current leader (not sure what to call him) was talking about a case in which a foreign woman was raped and murdered. He 'joked' that she shouldn't have been wearing a bikini. There wasn't much of a response to this too. Sex toys, abortion and even prostitution are illegal (no one believes me when i say this but it's true). Domestic violence, rape, sex trafficking, slavery, teen pregnancy and a number of other issues go ignored. Gender roles are distinct but it does seem to me that no one has a problem with this. I've found that Thailand doesn't have very progressive ideas about sex at all. If a teenage girl gets pregnant she's often pushed into marriage asap. Yes, there was a female prime minister but she was largely ridiculed as incapable and stupid (though i think she's miles better than the current dude) but it doesn't matter anyway because Thai people have little choice over who gets to lead them, it's certainly not a democracy after all. I love this country so much and it's so much better than my own so when I see that there are problems I really wish i could do something about it. "

The biggest change is how much happier I am. I walk taller, I don't sweat the small stuff, I feel more confident and capable that I can achieve any goals I set for myself. I love and appreciate myself in a way I never could before. I don't think you need to lose weight to do this, but it definitely made it easier for me. 

There are small benefits you don't even realize often though until you really reflect on how you feel now vs how you used to feel. Like being able to walk up stairs without getting winded, travelling without being worried about being uncomfortable in the airplane seat, eating at restaurants/in public without being anxious about what people are thinking about you and what you're eating. 

If you're reading this and struggling with your weight I just want to tell you that you absolutely can lose weight.

Female characters in movies are rarely anything more than a trophy, and when they are then the film is branded as a chick flick which most men aren't interested in watching. There just isn't as much of a risk of women writing unrealistic male characters because as a group we know too much about men/the male experience for there to be much room for fantasy."

I was told that if I couldn't, they'd box it up and it would be the next thing I would eat.  Even if it was soggy cereal.  I had to be punished.

Even today, going out to restaurants with them is frustrating because they make fun of me and call me difficult and ""Why are you even coming if you're not going to eat?"" when I take half of my huge meal home.  Or at home, my explosive Italian father insists on serving everyone, and will give me 2-3 times what I can eat.  Then a fight erupts later in the meal because I can't finish what he gave me.

"One time, years ago, my at-the-time boyfriend and another buddy were having breakfast before our weekly D&amp;D session, and I said something about the game and they were like ""Oh, D&amp;D is cancelled this week.  They're having a baby shower instead.""

"That it is okay to want things for myself and that didn't necessarily mean I was selfish. I spent so much of my formative years in servitude to others and that carried into my adult life, though at least I could channel it in a good way (being a teacher, working with young kids). So much of it was guilt over this ingrained idea I had of myself as a 'selfish' person. That was all my mother used to say to me, she'd constantly call me selfish whenever I asked for anything. So I learned to not ask, to not express my opinions, to not ask for any help. And somewhere I just internalised the message that I was selfish and frequently beat myself up over it.

But it wasn't until my SO said I was the most compassionate person he knew that it kind of snapped me out of the idea that I was a 'selfish' person. That was a trigger which helped me to re-evaluate who I thought I was."
"I liked a guy for a long time, just casually, but he couldn't date me because I was the wrong religion (which is to say, non religious). 

We talked horror movies, and hung out, and more than once fell asleep sitting on a sofa in the middle of a horror marathon. And Gundam Wing. He and I both liked Gundam Wing, and we even built models of the Gundams together. I liked the SD versions, he liked the battle scarred. We were close. But we never made out, or kissed, or did anything like holding hands. He made it clear he liked me, and resisting was one of the hardest things he'd done, and asked if I'd consider converting to his religion so he could court me. 

Then, one day when talking about what we wanted our future to look like, he told me that per his religion, his wife wasn't going to be allowed birth control, was going to be at home in the kitchen, preferably shoe-less and pregnant, and he meant it. 

That was a deal breaker, for me. I do not want 13 kids and to stay at home cooking and cleaning all day. 

We stayed friends, ish, but I told that I wasn't that girl. I'd never be that girl. He married someone else - a girl who grew up in his religion. They courted formally. They're at kid number 7 and counting, and she has no friends of her own or life her own. "

He laughed and walked away and she looked pretty shocked, but kind of laughed it off.

So many comments saying ""yeah, but he probably hooked up with her later, he definitely had a chance and there's no way she thought it was that creepy, if she wasn't at least kind of into it she wouldn't have had that little half-smile.""

"Back when the Monopoly game was new, I knew a guy who worked at McDonalds and stole a case of game pieces. A few of us tore them open for over a week. 

Not much cash, but we sorted the food prizes and ate at various McDs for quite a while. Even sold some to other students for spare change. "

"Very weird. Illustrative anecdote:

Last year, I volunteered at a con where there was a safe space for POC. I was doing patrolling rounds and knocked the door and walked in to check that everything was okay, and later I heard complaints about how a white woman had disrespected the POC space and how entitled she was and blah, they obviously meant me.

I get that my experience of racism is vastly different from that of someone who does not pass, of course I have it easier*. But passing privilege is fucking weird, and it's kind of exhausting to feel like I have to prove that I'm Hispanic when I go to Mexican parties or enter a POC safe space for 5 seconds or whatever. 

When I visit my birth country, strangers speak to me in English at first, because everyone thinks I'm white... so it feels like I don't really belong, in a way, but I also wasn't raised the same way most white people my age were, and I feel and identify as a minority, so my brain is like ???

*I get to compare it to my experience of homophobia, which is an area I have absolutely no passing privilege on."

"How insensitive people are when talking about having children.  To the point where I've had people ask if I'm having sex wrong, if I wanted pointers, and tell me to do certain things to encourage pregnancy.


Just stop.  "
"I was very poor at one point and needed $60 to pay the rent or be evicted. This was back when not many people had atm cards. This was back when you could write a check and count on it not clearing for a few days to a week. I only had $30 in my account. I went to one ATM and withdrew $20. I went to the next ATM right across the street and withdrew $20--the receipt was still showing a balance of $30. I then went to a grocery store bought $5 worth of food for the week and wrote the check for $25.  Of course, when all of them cleared I was charge with several overdraft fees, but at least I wasn't evicted. My landlord wouldn't take a check because my last one had bounced.

When I was a child we were even poorer, but I don't really think of this as a low--just a necessity, we would eat plain noodles and bread because we didn't have anything else in the house. This went on for several months."
"Picky eaters. I do not want to eat the same four meals all the time especially since I'm the one cooking them. I want to try new restaurants where you don't say ""ew"" to 90% of the menu when we are anywhere aside from American food places. I want to be exploring a new part of town and pop into some random food place and not have to sit and extensively Google what they have at that place. Just. Eat. Omg. "
"The physical descriptions of women being super aware of their feminine sex characteristics (*chests heaving, hips swaying, etc*), general idea of ""strength"" being centered around sexuality or rejecting men."

"I think the main difference between Titus and a lot of other ""gay BFF"" characters is that Titus is very much his own person. He doesn't exist to be a convenient fashion guide for Kimmy. This trope is much more applicable to a show like Sex and the City, where the gay characters only sporadically show up to say ""oh honey!"" and offer unconditional support."
"I took a job doing *technical writing*.

"""Bad boy with a heart of gold"" I'm weak for that trope, mostly in anime though."
"A good example of this is seen often when guys bring up the ""but if the genders were reversed"" argument.

Sometimes it's justified, like how an older woman dating an 18 y.o. boy isn't always seen as creepy as it should be. But usually, it's just a failed attempt to flip the tables when it doesn't apply.

For instance, today I saw a thread on the confessions sub about this guy who kissed a girl in her sleep, and I saw a ton of comments saying it wasn't that bad because ""if the genders were flipped, it would turn into a cute, flirty moment."" Sure, maybe some people would think a girl kissing a guy she doesn't know while he sleeps is cute... *if*, and only if, she's conventionally attractive. If it was someone they found ugly or fat, these Redditors would have been all up in flames and have cross posted to as many different subs as they could imagine.

The same thing happens when guys whine about how girls always get free drinks. Lots of """"unattractive"""" girls have never gotten a free drink. It's just confirmation bias."

"I am an American (of Indian descent), and this reminds me of Morocco. I was extremely (and pleasantly) surprised at how much women ran the show in cities like Marrakesh. Every building and institution I went into, women were the directors and heads, in places like banks and what not. They were so opinionated, funny, and intelligent, with the guys in the background. People in the West aren't aware of the strong and vivacious women in non-Western countries, and how vibrant those societies are."

"Of course! But I was unable to shave before there were razors with pink handles. Those were lost and hairy days. Even then, I was unable to shave without shrieking in unhinged horror at the sight of my naked body until I found *#realbeauty* body wash to use as shaving lotion. Now I find my fleshly meat prison a beautiful one. And instead of screaming, I orgasmicly condition my hair. Now I'm soft and smooth for the salad eating and laughter. "

An 11 hour date? What did you do
"She originally showed up in the Batman Animated Series.

Harleen Quinzel was a young, inexperienced psychologist at the Arkham Asylum who attempted to treat the Joker.

He fed her a story about how his father abused him and never laughed at his jokes, and she thought all he needed to be cured was to be shown love and compassion. Due to his charisma, Harley beings to fall in love with him.

At some point, the Joker escaped Arkham, only to be returned by Batman, beaten and bruised. To Harley, Batman was the real problem and only made the Joker worse.

Having fallen in love with the Joker, she adopted the alter ego of Harley Quinn, donning [her iconic jester costume](https://blogs-images.forbes.com/markhughes/files/2015/09/Harley-Quinn-Animated-Series.jpg?width=960). She helped him escape Arkham, and became his partner in crime.

For a sidekick in a 90s kids cartoon, Harley was a character with a lot of depth.

The Joker really saw her as disposable, he regularly rejected her romantic advances and would frequently smack her around. He kicked her out multiple times as well. Despite that, she was so obsessed with the Joker that she kept coming back. Even after he tries to kill her at one point.

Despite her obsession, there are times when she stands up to the Joker. She has beaten him up, left him out to dry, and helped Batman capture him. She even stopped him from setting off an atomic bomb out of spite, rather than any noble reasons. She also tries to kill the Joker at that point, by attempting to shoot him in the head. Unfortunately, (and unbeknownst to both her and Joker) she had picked up one of Joker's gag guns, and a little flag pops out of the barrel. Of course, instead of being angry she just tried to kill him, the Joker absolutely loves that she had the guts to pull the trigger and they make up.

There was a period of time where she quit working for him and teamed up with Poison Ivy instead, committing crimes as the Queens of Crime.

She's also much less of a sociopath with lol-so-random humor than Suicide Squad's depiction. She's goofy, bubbly, and oddly innocent at times. She doesn't have the same sort of sinister undertones that Margo's Harley has. There are tons of clips of The Animated Series Harley up on YouTube if you want a better idea of what I'm talking about."
"I've just started using Bumble and I've realized that I *hate* it when men include their height if it's not just included in the list of things about them.

But I've seen so many ""Don't worry ladies; I'm 6'4"" or ""I know you all have requirements, so I'm 6'1"" comments and nothing makes me swipe left faster."
"Fathers being gatekeepers of their daughters' sexualities and love lives. It all comes to the grand finale of ultimately forfeiting her to her new husband at the alter. (I know some people love this tradition and want to walk with their dads on their wedding day, but I personally don't like what the tradition represents so I don't want that for myself.)"
"Guys who do this please....you don't own my preferences in dating.  Please. 

If I'm not terribly interested in dating someone who is a policeman, I'm even less interested in explaining to you why that might be.  And zeroly interested in any conversation that starts ""What if he checks all of your other boxes and....""

That, and I've never met a woman who cares more about your dick size than you do. "
"College. I'm Latina &amp; went to inner city public schools my entire life with mostly other Latinx &amp; African Americans, but I got accepted into a university in another state where the student population was predominantly white and.....it was definitely different. Even though I've *always* been a minority, because I grew up around so many people who looked like me I'd never actually felt like one until then. "
"That's a big reason I always loved *Buffy the Vampire Slayer.* Buffy kicked ass and saved the world (a lot), but she also really wanted to put on a pretty dress and go to her prom and that didn't make her weak."

(Non sexual) Actions &amp; interests have NOTHING to do with your sexuality

"So, write a character as the human they are? Gotcha. "
"I would keep a total poker face and cook a miniature version of the cabbage recipe, then serve it on a tiny plate."
"Either everything is about being a woman or nothing is about being a woman. If it's everything: she got this job despite it being a boy's club because she rejected femininity as a young girl but then the boobs came and now sexuality is her weapon and ohmygod that male character is hot I must girly it up and turns out all I've ever wanted is to be a wife/mother. Just one or two of those would be okay, thanks. Or nothing is about being a woman: the character could have been Bob because nothing about having a female body or living in society as a woman ever comes up in thought, word, or action by her or anyone else. Both extremes are so far outside of my experience that it makes it hard to relate. I am not obsessed with being a woman, but it's not like it never comes up. "
That's a cool theory. Barney doesn't get the girl every time though. They once pointed out that he had a terrible batting average. 
"She got depressed and stopped talking to me. I would always talk to her like normal and invite her to do stuff which she would always say no to. I didn't mind because she was depressed, until I saw she was always talking to her other friends and going out with them all the time when she said she was going to be in bed (who also happen to be people who hate me for a misunderstanding I could never clear up) and I was like ""well fuck you then""."
Isn't that the point of the character?
"True, but as a woman, I still liked her. Yes, we saw her through this male lens, but there was still room for a fuller character behind that. As far as fantasies go, it's not nearly as insulting most others."
"It's also damaging to men who don't fit the mold! Someone asked my companion why he didn't sleep with someone when he had the chance to and he was like, ""??? Because I didn't like her???"""
"""What do women think about a man who [does a really specific thing that most people likely don't notice]?""

""Why do all women [do a thing that I saw one woman do one time]?"" 

I like lighthearted threads. Things like ""What fictional character would you be best friends with?"" are fun."
"Ohhhh I did something similar!

My roommate would listen to *really* loud annoying reggae music on YouTube, or watch Netflix in the living room at the same annoying volume, no matter how late it was. I eventually found out that if I set my uTorrent seeding limit to zero, everything else stopped working. So I started setting it to zero when I went to bed, or when she was being a brat for whatever reason, and her internet would stop working immediately."
"Somebody who always has to be right, makes a discussion out of anything and always wants to play devil's advocate. I really like a good discussion, but sometimes I want to talk to somebody without having to discuss or ""defend"" everything I'm saying. "

"Yes, if a movie like Superman had male only screenings I would pissed. Fuck that noise. Male fans of Wonder Woman shouldn't be excluded like this. "
"LOL this reminds me of the conversation my friend had with a Catholic priest about her wedding. My friend is originally from the Congo, and now lives here in Canada. Anyway, apparently the conversation went something like this:

Friend: Is it possible to make the Mass shorter? Maybe skip some parts?

Priest: No. We have to complete the whole Mass.

Friend: I'm just worried that it will end too close to the reception and I want time to take pictures in-between. I have the hall booked for 5 o'clock. (Note: the Mass was to start around 1pm or so.)

Priest: What? The Mass is only about an hour. You'll have lots of time.

Friend:.....Oh, really? Back home, Mass is four hours long. One hour will be ok!

A solid week later, she related this story to me and she was still flabbergasted at how short church services are here."
"Or lack thereof, and her father wanted a son."
"Also some people look good in real life stereoscopic vision, but due to their particular bone structure it doesn't translate well into a two dimensional photograph. The opposite can happen too. I know someone who is stunning in photos, but in person looks much different."
"Weight, I guess. 

I've dated a couple of slightly overweight people in the past, but probably wouldn't go back to that after having had a relationship with a person of equal fitness level to me and experiencing how pleasant that is.

I'm not even going to sugarcoat it and make it totally about lifestyle choices, because part of it is just that fit people look more attractive."
I'm kind of surprised by the comments here. Does not one else struggle to eat their salad every time? It's hard to consume when I am grinning and laughing the whole time. I've started to avoid salads as a result.
"I have 3 good ones. All 3 OkCupid.

First - guy had super cute pictures, looked fit, my type. Met up &amp; I literally didn't recognize him because he was so big. Like had gained a good 100 lbs since the pictures. Turns out those were high school pictures. The date was awful. At the end he expected me to suck his dick. He pulled it out &amp; it was as big as my pinky. I laughed &amp; left.

Second - guy had okay pictures. He said he'd buy me food so I was like eh okay. Holy mother Jesus god he was hot. Like omg. We hooked up for a few months, nothing serious.

Third - guy had awkward photos, but he offered food, so we went out. He was an awkward guy, but sweet, &amp; he'd be cute with a full beard, not the Abe Lincoln chin strap he had. We went out a few times. Fast forward 4 years, he's grown in the full beard, I changed the way he dresses, &amp; we've been married 2 years."
"Just mentioned this on another question, but I met my fiance on OkCupid. When we met up I realized his pictures were probably over 5 years old, angled so they didn't show his bald spot, and he'd gained at least 50 lbs since then.

I was disappointed but went ahead and obviously it worked out for us. I've never directly asked him about it, but we've talked about our experiences dating and I realized that basically he just hadn't been dating in a long time. Before I messaged him, he hadn't logged onto OkC in at least 2 years, and prior to that he didn't use it much. I suspect he put up some slightly old pictures when he joined back in 2009 and then just never bothered to update with new pics."
"I thought those two were supposed to be deconstructions of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl (graphic novel Ramona, not movia Ramona).  They both start out as the unique special snowflake with colored hair who seems to exist only to pull the boring/immature male protagonist out of his slump.  Things sour when Ramona/Clementine's emotions don't perfectly align with what Scott/Joel wants in a partner.  Scott/Joel has to develop as a character, come to terms with the fact that Ramona/Clementine is a thinking, feeling woman, and decide whether to give things another shot."
"Don't eat out as much or if you can help it, don't eat out at all and cook your own meals."
"i wasn't allowed to have emotions that made anybody feel bad. if my dad hit me, i had to accept his sorry, no questions asked, even though it was the 100th time. because his feeeliiiiings he's really sorry you know. can't reject boys who call or come to the house because their feeeliiings. my mom forced me to talk to them.

then i had to watch my grandma (mother figure) die of cancer without shedding tears or being anything less than 100% happy to see her, bald and deathly skinny and tubes everywhere. because it would make her feel bad for dying.

still trying to overcome it without overcorrecting, tbh."
"&gt;Or they don't really want sex, just use it to get other things that would benefit them.

And if a woman does want sex at all, that must mean she probably has a lot of sex and will sleep with everyone, which somehow makes her a bad person."
"And isn't that the joke? I mean,  they don't present Kevin as in any way he is meant to be taken seriously,  but rather as a bit of a role reversal:  'see men,  this is the role you usually shove a token woman in to in a male dominated movie.'  Which is a touch unfair as (from what I've read,  I've not rewatched the original Ghostbusters as an adult) the original movie actually took the female in that role very seriously.  But since this is a female dominated movie,  it was meant as a tongue and cheek dig at the trope.  "
"Believing in ghosts. 

Idk I thought I'd be more forgiving of some of that in a partner. Because I love ghost stories and creepy shit, but apparently it's a real turnoff for me when someone wants to tell me how the wind blowing their window open means there's a Presence in their house--and they're not saying it flippantly, they're saying it as though they think their believing in ghosts is cute and interesting. 

I suddenly started feeling like--are you serious? You're not a baby... It was over pretty soon after."
"I grew up in a hoarder-esque home with a father who kept buying stuff and buying stuff and buying stuff, and as a result, I never had a tidy house. I was never taught how to clean up. My house was always too messy to bring friends or boyfriends over, and my boyfriend of five years hasn't been to my home because I'm so ashamed of it.

I've not moved out yet, but 
I'm having to teach myself to tidy things. I'm having to teach myself that just because I don't 'register' the mess as being mess, it's still mess and needs to get sorted out. "
"Yes for the penis thing. I feel like both bigger than average and smaller than average penises are in the same category: can do with adjustments, but I'd rather have sex with a guy without the risk of him seriously injuring my cervix because of his size. "
"That emotions aren't scary things in reality. 

Learn to relate to them in yourself and in others in a healthy manner."
"Of course they're being excluded. Being told ""you can't be here because you are male"" is inherently exclusionary."
"Yeah, the prevalent mindset on Reddit that women will do everything in their power to get money out of a man is... Ridiculous, to say the least. I'm pretty sure most adults have financial stability as a checklist on the things they look for in a partner, but somehow this is only seen as greedy and awful in women. When the reality is, most of us don't want to end up in a spot where another adult is financially dependent on us. "
"Um, well I definitely want this at least."
"Refusing to hold my hand in public. 

It wasn't because he didn't like PDA. It was because he didn't want people to know we were together."

"I had something similar recently, met up with a guy who I didn't talk to much online, we'd just arranged a drink, because his profile seemed pretty cool, and he had this scar down his face which looked awesome to be honest. I have some scars on my face too, so I was intrigued.

We met up and instantly I noticed he was a little 'off' but thought fuck it, let's just go for a drink and a chat. It turns out that the scar was from a really bad car crash when he was a teenager, there was some significant brain injury, he had a long and difficult road to recovery.

Then he started talking about racial purity, the islamification of europe and racial IQ differences and I checked the fuck out. There was debate, but I'm pretty sure he only appeared to be listening to me because he wouldn't have minded some racially 'pure' babies with me. I told him I was part native American and never spoke to him again."

"Hmm, that's the point of her character though. Jessica is a literal product of the male gaze and goes out of her way to tell Eddie that it's NOT her fault that she's so sexy that men act like animals around her.

Her overtly bodacious body is there to also trick the audience out of their sexist presumptions of her character. The audience is expected to react to her like Eddie, to see her as nothing but the exaggerated breasts, lips, and hips that she's created with. But her character turns out to be that of a loving wife who is so smart that she cracks the case on her missing husband and saves Eddie's life. "

This year, H befriended my boyfriend's roommate unknowingly and hung out at their apartment. Upon hearing this, I told my boyfriend about what he did in first year. My boyfriend conveyed to his roommate, who then conveyed to H that his behaviour wasn't a secret. He immediately called my boyfriend (despite having my number after forcing my phone from my hand in first year) and apologized to HIM about ""encroaching"". 

Why can't men recognize that women are people with agency and feelings and not just objects to be owned by other men?"
"In highschool my parents were too broke one year to give me any money for lunch, and there really wasn't any safe food in the house to pack and eat. There was a teacher who kind of caught on that a group of us didn't have any lunch ever, and everyday he would give us a little money and ask us to head down to the cafeteria and grab him some cookies and go ahead and get ourselves something too.  I lived off of that and raman noodles for dinner for like six months. Thanks Mr. Weaver."

"Turning off the power in the laundry room.

My room is right next to the laundry room, and I usually work from 8-4 during the week (along with going to school afterwards). So I asked her to try to have her laundry done by midnight. She had a problem with this despite the fact she only works from 4-9 PM a few days a week. She was mad because she couldn't figure out when she was supposed to do her laundry, because apparently getting up before one in the afternoon and doing a few loads then is inconceivable.

The fusebox is in my room, so I just started flipping it off before I go to bed (regardless if she's got anything going or not) and locking my door. She hasn't put two and two together yet."

And a guy made a comment saying that women are really bad with rejection and that he wants to avoid that ""nuclear holocaust"" ignoring the fact that men can get straight up terrifying if rejected.  

So I think people dismiss the fact that women who are dating don't have it as easy as they think."
"When I was a young teen, my mother, my two older sisters and I all stayed in one bedroom at my grandmother's house, with one queen sized bed, until I was sixteen. (Starting when I was in grade school) Two of us slept on the floor, two slept on the bed. We would always have our mother sleep on the bed due to her illnesses. (Cancer, anemia, lupus etc) We all shared one bathroom as well. Our toys were paper dolls from magazines or printed from online. It was rough.

I'll never know what truly got us out of that situation, but I know that I am thankful we went through it, because I know what life like that is. I'm very grateful now."
"&gt; 'artsy nerdy girl who is secretly a babe' 

Lol, this is the worst shit. ""She's all that"" really is number one in all the shitty tropes. I will never forget Laney Boggs, the unpopular artsy nerd who no one could ever like cause she wears a ponytail, glasses and overalls. Like ew. How could he ever turn her into a popular girl. I mean yeah, it's Rachael Leigh Cook ...but *she wears glasses*. She had paint on her overalls once. What a beastmonster."
"I lived in a really scary neighborhood (drug deals, a guy was murdered in the complex and his body was left in the dumpster where I put my trash) and I didn't feel unsafe most of the time.  I had a solid door and I just didn't answer it if I didn't know the person.  I also got to know my neighbors and we all kind of watched out for each other.  A guy from work came to pick me up once but couldn't remember which apartment I was in, so he was asking around about me (only white woman in the complex).  A couple of guys kept him distracted while a couple of others sneaked around to my door to ask if I was expecting someone.  

The guy who was murdered was targeted because he was a Hispanic man, and I wasn't so I wasn't worried about that.  Most of the people who were victims of crime knew the perpetrator - drug deals gone wrong, drug dealers robbed, that kind of thing.  

I actually felt safer there than when I moved to a ""nice"" part of town that happened to be near a popular bar so drunk college guys were constantly being jerks (catcalling, following me home after I refused their advances, and then just sort of mischief like throwing glass bottles out of their car windows)."
"That women who are attractive are unaware of it. Some of them are, but the trope of the super attractive slightly awkward girl who has no idea she's beautiful and receives all this special treatment is trite."
"When I was homeless I realised that I had to completely remove any sense of shame in order to survive. I went the whole nine yards, eating scraps from tables in fast food places, from trash cans, dumpster diving, rolling cigarettes from butts on the street. 

Oh and pad-tampons. Can't buy menstrual products when you're homeless, so I'd roll my own tampons out of a single pad- you'd get up to 3 tampons out of a pad, so it was more economical. If I couldn't get pads it was just rags. "
"Too young for gallbladder removal.

Guess who went to a different surgeon a year later, who actually touched where it would be, acknowledged it's ridiculously inflamed, and now I have no gallbladder? :'D"
I hope you shaved your already baby smooth legs before that shampooing
"&gt; I was 25 thinking I was going out with another 25 year old, not 40!

Hooooly shit. That's so not ok. I wouldn't be able to go through with it. That part bothers me the most. Even more than his attempt at talking like Del Trotter or whatever.

 "
"Another BTTF fan here. I've always been a bit disheartened with how the two Bobs talk about how stressed out they were about how to manage the sequel, because if they knew there was going to be a sequel they NEVER would have put Jennifer in the car.

Bit like... why not? They could have made Jennifer an interesting third protagonist. Doc is the wild scientist, Marty is the hot head and Jennifer could have been a great snarky foil for their pie-in-the-sky ways! 

Instead they rendered her unconscious, dragged her onto a pile of trash and had the adventure without  her.  

Always felt like a wasted opportunity :( "
That's a super cute analogy.
"Wearing a green shirt the day after someone else wore a green shirt. Or was it red? Whatever. Something about ""mirroring"" as a signal she wanted to hook up. "
"She said she had a great time, just didn't really want to see the guy again."
"It sounds silly but what I did was put little jingle bells on the front and back doorhandles of my place. That way if anyone was trying to open I could hear the bells and grab for my baseball bat :)

It's not much but knowing that the little creaking you just heard was just that, and not someone trying to open the door in the middle of the night made a world of difference for me. "
"grease me up, woman!"
"Nope.

I don't believe any of the stories and I really don't care at all about it."
"&gt; Kids and teenagers were often way more polite.

I say all the time that young people are almost always more polite than older people. Even adults in their 20s-30s are WAYYYYY nicer than a lot of middle aged or elderly folks.

I have had internal meltdowns trying to grocery shop because of rude older people."
"Those poor, poor summer children. I noticed too that people who don't come from cold climates severely underestimate weather."
All of his hobbies involved sitting in front of screens. I couldn't stand it. 
That's pretty crappy. Your feelings/relationship should take priority over just blurting things out callously.
Dating isn't just hard for you. Stop assuming 'women have it much easier.'
"I don't think of basic as what they wear or what they enjoy. Rather, it's how they think about things. Stereotypically, I'd think of a frat guy who enjoys sports. However, if he wants to have stimulating conversations, enjoys learning, and respects others, that's not so basic. For me, it's important to be an educated citizen of your world - caring about politics and international issues. This includes listening and respecting the experiences of others. It means believing there is more out there and knowing you don't know everything. He doesn't rely just on what his friends like or what is ""cool."" He's an individual. 
Basic = boring. "
They're spreading. I've seen these boys cropping up in fucking Staten Island.
"That's kinda how I felt, too. Now, if they *did* make it to my particular apartment on the 4th floor, I'd be kind of SOL, but there is safety in numbers and living with hundreds of other people made me seem like a less likely target of random violence.

That said, I still covered my bases and took safety measures to protect my home and person"
"That if you're in a relationship, you shouldn't have close friends of opposite gender, which also doesn't account for people who are not heterosexual. "
Pineapple on pizza. Ham and pineapple is my favourite pizza topping combo. Come at me.
"I'm bisexual and monogamously engaged to a man, so I pass as straight for sure. It makes me feel highly invisible, fake, and angry. It makes me nervous and uncomfortable in contexts where someone assumes I'm straight, speaks as such, and then I have to decide if it's worth it to come out to them on the spot or not. This happens especially often at work. "
For guys to be in charge in a hetero relationship. ESPECIALLY because what they mean by that is when we expect the guy to not leave ALL the work on us it means the guy is in charge. 
"How **""leaning in"" doesn't work for most women.** I've worked at places that were openly hostile to women who negotiated, but thought that men who did were smart. 

I have also been added to ""social clubs"" against my will - because I was one of the only women in the office. It meant I had to do unpaid ""social"" work like planning work birthday parties. And also ended up responsible for cleaning up. 

I've also been punished for being a woman without kids. I've had potential employers straight up ask me if I had kids, or was planning on having kids soon. Then once working, I got screwed because I wasn't a parent, but was a single woman. I always was the one who had to work special events, or was expected to work late. I've had bosses not treat me seriously because I wasn't as ""grown-up"" as people with kids. "

Hey you must know my parents
"I went to my first *real* gyno visit when I was around 20. Although I had sex a few times, it had alway been painful for me and most of the time my partner had trouble penetrating me. I also avoided tampons because they hurt.

So, when the time came to take my pap, she had a REALLY hard time. She grew frustrated with me, and said very harshly:

""This is the problem! You are so out of touch with your sexuality that you are not allowing yourself to loosen up. It's a confidence issue because you are ill-at-ease with your body! I can refer you to some sex therapists and psychologists.""

Reality: I have a low cervix, which causes painful intercourse. It's not anything harmful, does not cause fertility problems or anything, but can make the vaginal canal a bit tighter than in most women. Due to the pain it caused, I had developed Vaginismus, which made it feel as if I was wearing an internal chastity belt.

Due to that gynecologist, I spent most of my early 20's fearing that I would never be able to have 'normal' sex, despite how I did not have any hang ups about it, and I was perfectly at ease with my body. 

The kicker is, that particular gynecologist marketed herself about how ""in tune"" she was with women's bodies. How could she have not even considered Vaginismus, let alone missed the location of my cervix during my pap?!"
Pretty much any female character written by Woody Allen.
"My ex's brain would break anytime he needed to pack a suitcase for a trip, even just for overnight.  It would take him hours,  and he would still end up with either far too much or far too little.  I think it was more of a quirk than immaturity.  Still,  it was pretty amazing that a 32 year old man needed his girlfriend to pack his suitcase.  "
"I always found the College Humour""Are you Asian Enough"" video to be spot on in how exhausting it can be to exist in the space that isn't ""enough"" of either. In Canada I'm the normal girl until someone finds out about my ancestry (then I'm Asian chick even though I don't look any different), in Japan I'm that white girl who isn't Japanese enough."
"I'm Christian. Because Jesus saved me and God loves me. Because I believe what Bible says.

I answered since you asked. I'm personally too tired of debating this on internet, so if anyone feels like arguing and challenging me, please don't, I'm not answering. You are free to believe what you want, let me do the same :)"
"Oh, and that im dressing to attract random men. No, if im dressing up, it's most likely for other women. Not to attract them, but either as a way to keep up with the masses (eg fancy events) or as a self esteem booster when it starts random convos laced with compliments, tips and where to find deals on clothes 😍 Seriously, is a guy gonna care that I managed to pair three different patterns in such a cute way?  I think not. "
"I've mentioned this a few times already. Anyway it is really creepy, thus is bears further witness.

I worked with a very attractive woman pretty, soft spoken, and kind. Yeah yeah, tv and movie tropes and all that, but this happened I think before trope was even a word.

Anyway, A local lawyer was really putting the moves on her, and she kept blowing him off. She was lots younger and well...not creepy, so why mix.

He had been asking her for dates for months. *Months*....and never taking no for an answer.

Anyway, he got mad and superglued all the locks on her house shut. The police caught him lurking around on her property one night and hauled him off to jail.

He was fairly well known, so it because this big hoo-aa for a few weeks.

Well for sure the creepy thing was that he was stalking her. He knew where she lived...she never told him, so he obviously was following her around.

I mean, this guy was totally fucked. They had a library of evidence against him, but the worst...the very worst....  

...the very worst...thing..

...the police dusted her house for evidence, and found that her 1st level windows were covered in *his* finger prints. There were so many of his fingerprints that they could have only been left there over a period of weeks or months. All the while, she had *no idea* she was being followed and watched in her own home.

makes me fucking cringe just thinking about it."
I'll never understand this. What's the point of outright lying? What do these people think is going to happen? It's not like you can just gloss over the fact that you're not the person you claimed to be. Do they think the other person will just be so taken with their personality that they'll overlook the outright lie? 
"Sounds like a computer problem, not a doctor problem."
"The characters internally react to men...strangely (for lack of a better word).  The female character will meet one of the significant male characters and spend multiple pages dissecting everything about him and making huge inferences based on no information.  Something about the way he shakes her hand will remind her of her father and then she'll go on this huge mental tirade where she figures out everything about him.  

Like I'm a pretty analytical person, I definitely over-analyze people and my interactions with them.  I could totally sympathize with a character who over-analyzed everyone they met.  However, I have never thought about anyone to the degree that female characters in literature think about random dudes that they've just met.      "
"I once saw an askmen thread where they debated what was an ""average"" looking woman. Top answers were Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Watson. So... yeah."
