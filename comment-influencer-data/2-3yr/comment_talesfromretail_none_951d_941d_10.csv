"$1200
So, 3 used textbooks?"
"&gt;They called about the wrong store.

So they said when they were caught in the lie."
"""Do you have a cute customer discount?""

""We sure do.  Your total will be $(full price)."""
"&gt;After hearing the story my quote team put his quote first.

Oh...oh no...they *caved!*

&gt;They then put an 'arsehole' tax of 45% on the total price of fire and installation and send it.

Oh.  No they didn't.  Sweet, sweet karma, CM.

&gt;Customer accepts the price and we rake in the profits.

And the customer proves once again that stupidity knows no bounds."
Yay for good bosses who stand up for their workers and will take a difficult customer to task !!  Too many of the OTHER kind !  
"""Hello, i'm buying all this food. I EXPECT to get something out of this sale"""
He's got balls. He acknowledged you and expected not to be stopped.
"Having a family member with dementia, this would surprise me if this was not the case with your customer. "
"2 textbooks + 1 loose-leaf, shrink-wrapped ""book"""
"Wow, you're like some kind of butcher cupid!"
Fuck your boss for taking such a long time to clear you.  Once the footage was reviewed it should have been seen as a lie!
"It took me 2 hours to read this post. 

And by two hours I mean 2 minutes.


Some people."
"I don't blame him. He had to cover his ass, and ended up going through the entirety of that seven hour shift to prove that I wasn't responsible for anything of the sort.

In the end, we were actually laughing about the absurdity of the whole affair."
"It's bad enough people do this, but nowadays with time stamped receipts it's just plain stupid.

I get similar dumb comments every time I close my shop for a holiday. Some jerk (and for some reason it's always middle aged men) will come in the following week all indignant and say: ""I've been coming here every day for WEEKS and you are NEVER open! What kind of way is this to run a business??!!""

And I'm deadpan like, ""Sir. I closed for the Fourth of July.""

100% of the time they argue and say that's NOT true, you've been closed for weeks I drove here from wherever and you weren't open!

All I can say in return is, ""Well I guess I would know..."" I mean seriously, how do they think a small business could just randomly close for several weeks and stay afloat? Like is rent not a thing? But more importantly, why on earth do they tell such ridiculous lies and stick to them? Hell-oooo, it's 2017, everything is on video and in the computer, sheesh!"
"Seems messed up. Why were you getting questioned so thoroughly before he even looked at the tapes? Get the physical evidence first, then armed with that knowledge start asking questions. And the 2 hours or so of your boss reviewing this evidence while talking to every other staff member in full view of you while you're just twisting in the wind.

 I don't know it just seems kind of unprofessional on your bosses part. Interested to hear what you or any of the readers here have to say about my point of view though. "
"We have a place in town that does this, but they have a bunch of punch shapes that they use. My card right now has two stars, a heart, and a circle. Maybe if you swapped them up, gave her a new card, and when she came back in with all circles instead of cute shapes, you could tell her to her face that you discontinued the circle punch and now had proof to ban her?"
"Don't know why the comments seem to be so dead set against you. In the US, not only would we be fired for selling alcohol to someone underage, we could also face charges and get the store liquor license taken away. So good on you for trying to do your job, OP."
"I sell cameras.  I've never had anyone come it and a buy a really high end camera and make a big deal out of ""what can you do for me"".  Sometimes I can give them a memory card.  The store can eat $20 and live with a four thousand dollar sale.  I have the worst time with people buying the low end SLR cameras.  

""Hey, I'm spending ***ALL*** this money.  What can you do for me?""

Uhhh, give you a camera? I guess I can help get it set up. I guess.  If I have too.  

"
You guys don't have the automatic check runners where it takes the money right then and after you give the check back. I thought most places had these?
"WOW, that is crazy insane.  You are very lucky.  Somebody obviously did not teach that guy money management, or anger management, when he was young.  I have had a few flip out on me as well but wow..."
But in the customer's mind he won. They should have given him the quote on Tuesday and added the arsehole tax.
"Why can't more people do this? One of my hugest pet peeves is people leaving shopping carts in random places (in parking spots are the worst), so I round them up and, if not bring them all the way to the front, then at least put them in one of those corrals so they're easy to retrieve."
"Reminds me of the ""do you give pretty girls tickets"" video"
"She probably never throws anything away. She keeps running across the same buried postcard on her kitchen counter and thinks she's getting new mail.

I hate people.  o_O"
We'll throw in a week's worth of gastric distress at no extra charge.
Managers were too afraid of bad customer surveys at my store to do anything like this. Closest thing was a manager once apologized to me and bought me lunch that day to make up for it. 
"Your printer only wants genuine HP^^tm Paper. It's specially formulated to keep printers happy, and includes all the minerals you need to keep your printer as healthy as possible. Sure, genuine HP^^tm Paper costs a little bit more, but isn't it worth it to keep your printer happy and well-fed? Your printer will thank you for it.

This message brought to you by someone totally not connected with the Happy Printer (HP^^tm) Company."
"Ugh, ew. Why do people think acting like this is okay? I've had a couple of times when a customer is trying to flirt and I just say outright ""Stop it, you're making me uncomfortable."" Then they act all offended like ""Jeez, I was just being friendly!"""
"Haha ""lol fuck off you've only spent 60 bucks here."" I love your manager. "
That pulls my heart strings. I can't imagine what that must feel like. 
"That's what its always about, *compensation*. Fucking disgusting people. When they find out they chose the wrong excuse to use because they didn't bother paying attention to where they are, they want to screech ""I don't care if I'm wrong, I want to take something from someone over this"". I can't believe how many people there are that I wouldn't care disappeared."
"Someone tried saying that to me once, that we were closed when they came all the way down. As my post says, my store is open 24/7. We literally never close. "
"Yeah to do 23 subjects, one needs a Time Turner."
"&gt; 1 loose-leaf, shrink-wrapped ""book""

My son's college math book was this way. $279 bucks for a 2.5 inch thick loose leaf book. Binder sold separately, of course."
No.  Back in the day we had a service where you called in (pre internet) the numbers and they verified it.  It was only useful on higher priced sales and it was expensive.  Mostly knowing the signs was the best deterrent.  As checks became less used and everybody has a debit card we choose not to have the extra cost of check verification.
"lol What a dingus.

... My printer on the other hand, CLEARLY has paper in it, but it keeps telling me it is out. =__="
I'm sure that's exactly what it is. Always an experience to have her here...
Who's chopping onions in here?!?!
"Question: Why would they not be able to return a particular item in store, and have to go to the manufacturer instead? Just wondering the reason because I've never seen this before myself

Edit: Thanks for all of the replies! I was pretty confused about this"
"""You're absolutely right, we don't. Sign here."""
"That's a good question! My supervisors have explained to me before that we have to be really careful and inspect EVERYTHING in the returned items to make sure it's correct/everything is still there. Apparently if we send it back to the manufacturer incomplete or incorrect, our store gets charged thousands of dollars. Since the manufacturer states on the product itself that it cannot be returned in the store and provided their own customer service line on the label, I think if we took the item back and sent it back to the manufacturer we would get the charge. That is the only thing I can think of with my experience working up there. There are other products that usually state that we cannot return them once they have been purchased are prepaid cards and gift cards.  
  
I think in his case though, from what he made it seem like, he only needed it for one time and wanted to return it afterwards."
"Not sure of its worth investing in, but some places will custom make stamps and punches.  You might be able to get your logo as one.  If it's custom you won't have to worry about that"
"&gt; Ma'am, I don't know who you think you're are, but you're not.

That's movie quote good."
It takes a manager telling them the same thing you told them for them to believe it.
"Exactly. I have witnessed this same thing soooo many times where the customer is just looking for a problem, then back away once they're caught and look dumb. "
"My great-grandfather had a go-to phrase for this sort of baffling behavior.  He would simply lock eyes with the offender and ask, in his thick Yiddish accent, ""Vhat? Vere you born in a barn?"""
"Not sure where, but I once heard someone say ""If you sold hot dogs with a punch in the face for a dollar extra, the customer would do everything they could to get the punch in the face for free.""

That is what this woman was doing it seems."
"The boss wanted to get my point of view before reviewing the tapes, in case he saw something that could somewhat fit what the customer said if viewed with that mindset."
Whoever let him leave the store originally without leaving a credit card is going to have their nuts in a sling.
That vendor should learn from you and donate those products.
"C'mon, real Philly natives know Pat's and Geno's is for the tourists! And provolone is the only contender. 

But real talk, that was cute as heck. Good job going the extra mile :)

"
Customers try real hard.  At my job they'll take whole stacks of things and move them into empty spots on shelves so the price will look like it's cheaper and most stores will honor that price.  But not us nice try buddy.  
"As a photographer, I see this happen way too much. You're barely spending anything on this baby/entry body and you want a  free: filter, memory card, bag, another lens, battery grip and the number for the cute girl at the other counter. Like screw you, this is retail not a trading post!"
"Opticians practices get the weirdest customers. We regularly get people coming in complaining because they went to the old location (which is just around the corner) because we didn't tell them we moved.

We did move. Six years ago. "
I don't like this front page. Do you have another one in the back?
"So what part of the store did one of your co-workers find the hidden, no longer wanted cupcake?  Or did he actually buy it?

After reading TFR, one of these things would shock me, the other not so much.  I'm pretty sure we all know which is which."
"""Bruh, It's only the law. Quit being so serious!"""
"I dunno, we once had a guy try to steal a hot roast chicken by stuffing it down his pants and running from security. Those girls seem organised in comparison."
"Yeah, only it's cupid's cleaver through the heart."
"What? Sorry but he could have nipped this in the bud at the first turn by looking at the tapes then talking to you about it after he's sure nothing actually happened. It's bad form to put you in that position and create that kind of uncertainty for you while completely in the dark about what actually occurred.

I just feel bad for you is all, seems like you went through a lot of internal turmoil that could have been easily avoided if your boss had handled things a little bit differently"
"England retail is hell as like anywhere in the world but this overall ""The customer is always right"" and getting written up in America baffles me. It's a completely different kettle of fish.  

I've been to America lots of times and always found everyone to be super *overly* polite compared to England. How any human could assume fault with an employee to the point of interrogating co workers leaves me dumbfounded.  

I feel sorry for OP, that tale sure strung me out too."
"I didn't help with romance or anything. But I think this story will be just as good.

I have this very sweet old lady that always visits my check stand when I am around. On my first encounter with her, there was a long line in my queue as we were understaffed and a twenty something gentleman was getting impatient and was verbally harassing me to hurry up.

Old Lady: ""You sir, need to be patient with that young man at the register, he is clearly doing the best he can! If you can't wait, go somewhere else!!""

The guy leaves my line, and goes elsewhere. I serve the few people in front and then I get to the sweet old lady (SOL). She was the last person in line. 

I greet her and thank her for sticking up for me. We get to talking about how people don't have time to enjoy life and it somehow led to her telling me that her husband recently passed away. My heart broke for this lady. I give her my condolences. She tells me about how they met, and the life they shared. Her spirits seemed to lift a little as she talked about her husband. She then gave me some advice: ""live your life to the fullest, don't be afraid to slow down and take it all in"". She then asked me what I wanted to do in the future. I told her that I was currently attending college pursuing a degree in mechanical engineering. She told me to keep working hard, and to not let anyone discourage me from my dreams. 

I am currently in my second year of college, and still going stronger than ever! 

She has been one of my regular customers ever since.

Other customers can learn a thing or two from this old lady!

"The fact the item was a power battery might be the reason here. Most of the times, batteries are considered consumable items. Manufacturer might want to be sure stores don't put the item back on shelves instead of sending the returned power battery to them, as improper or excessive usage of a battery are more likely to alter its quality than it would with other items. Taking care of return themselves may save them from conflicts with your store and their customers. "
You wouldn't want it. It's a POS.
Wow. Good catch! And what stupid people.
