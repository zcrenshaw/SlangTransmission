"My mom used to so something similar for me when she would go on business trips (minus the sexy note). For every day she was gone there would be a package with some candy and a small dollar store type toy. It made her being gone easier plus satisfied my ""gifts getting"" love language. "
"He doesn't want a serious relationship with you.  

From the sounds of it, he's jealous that you're doing well without him.  And he likes getting sex on a regular basis.

Try to maintain No Contact.  The fact that you're more content without him is a sign that the relationship isn't right for you."
"I don't think it's anything that sinister. He hasn't manipulated me into anything, and I didn't comfort him after the accident. He's one of those people who just really needs to feel helpful, to the point where it can cause more problems."
Go by a nickname or something? People will grow out of the jokes over time
It seems like you are the one upset over nothing and shes upset you are making such a big deal out of literally nothing.

"Married woman here. /u/Simpleadvice4u's comment is *exactly* how I'd go about that conversation. If it ends in a break up, so be it. But the fact of the matter is it's not a negotiation, period. If BF wants to be an immature child about it, that's his prerogative. "

But why would she mention past relationships anyway? Even if she were 100% straight it would still be weird for her to mention people she slept with when she's having her first meeting with her boyfriend's parents. 
"""Not wearing a bra under clothing"" is not ""exposing yourself""."
"Even though he's using it as an excuse,  I'll point out most contractors work for a company,  and as long as they are proficient at their job,  they'll get a new offer on another contract. Seriously,  it's very common. 

To the actual post...if he moves in,  I honestly think you'll be miserable.  You'll be teaching an adult man skills that he should have started to learn almost a decade ago.  I know 4 years is a long time,  but imagine the misery of spending the next 4 showing someone how to do laundry. ..someone who is in their 30s!"

Yep. How the envelope is addressed tells you everything.
"I already had the box when he said he would take it. And the difference is he had no right to order me to hand over the box. It should have been a negotiation or a discussion. I do have the right to stop him from messing around in my kitchen. He should have expected that ripping the box from my hands might cause an injury, but I had no reason to expect that me picking up the box would do anything.

Where do you draw the line? Am I supposed to obey everything he says just in case by some crazy chance it causes an injury (caused by him)?"

It's actually a pretty accurate one. Are you still 19?
"No, you feel intensely,  which is not the same as deeply."
"I don't expect a guy to tell me I'm the prettiest girl in the world. 

I *do* expect that he doesn't actively gawk over other women. He wouldn't have to explain that he's gawking because he thinks they are prettier if he wasn't making it blatantly obnoxious that he's staring. 

He has some growing up to do. He's being quite disrespectful. It's not a matter of him being honest, it's about being respectful. "
Are you sure you're not the husband here? You seem unusually invested.
I think she could do with some therapy too
Holy shit! Your wife is a terrible human being.
"As others have said, this is called karma. 

Your ex told and the company deemed your husband to be a bad fit based on ethics. Fair is fair. Your ex was there first, your husband does not just get a role because he wants it- especially if it could interfere with the productivity of the company or cause problems in the workplace. 

That's how the world works. Your ex was smart and professional to inform his company that he could not be unbiased.

"Exactly what I'm thinking he is running away with his kid, there is something really dark there, poor man."
Why is she drunk snap chatting him? Why did she lie? She did two shady things and you need to talk to her in person and ask why she did them. Kinda seems like she may have wanted him there... or thought you would back out fi you knew earlier. The only reason she would like is to hide something. Figure out what that is.
"Yeah its not normal. It's amazing that they love each other but they shouldn't be having sex/starting to have sex in easily accessible rooms when their children are around. Having sex in places like that when other can easily come and see/hear you is gross and disrespectful, no matter if you are a 20-year old or 50-year old. 

I know that my parents love themselves so much and have sex regularly but they always respect me and never have sex in ""public"" rooms of the house when I'm there too. And I do the same because I respect them. "
"I think if OP says that he should also be prepared that she may end the friendship completely rather than just cut back.

Different people have different boundaries of course, but I would never hang out with someone I knew had feelings for me when I have a boyfriend. I feel like it would be too disrespectful and putting myself in a bad situation - even if I did not return any feelings/attraction. 

If my boyfriend hung out with a woman who confessed her feelings to him and wanted to stay friends, I'd be hurt too. Because why else confess you like them unless your hope is they'll end their relationship and be with you instead.

Someone who isn't a friend of my relationship is no friend of mine (though I also recognize I've never had a bad relationship. I've had relationships end - always amicably- but I've never been with anyone bad or abusive or who mistreated me. So it may be easier for me to put so much value on my significant other)."
"As a millennial, I can't afford to ""grow up"" in the way OP's dad seems to expect. "
"In australia, student loans are a form of welfare. You default to a defacto relationship (and treated as married) if you live with anyone and your benefits will be reduced or denied.

 (this includes same sex people, our government  recognizes same sex couples when it comes to welfare but not.when it comes to marriage etc. Go figure). 

The onus is on the individual to prove they are not part of a couple. You answer shitty questions about whether or not you share chores (still not sure which answer means you're a couple there?) And a few years ago they started going through Facebook profiled trying to pictures and comments where you've tagged your 'housemate' as your partner, and launching investigations into benefits fraud.

Edit: I just found out that they also recognize poly situations. Ah, australian government, you are kind of hypocritical "
"How are you an asset to a relationship?  How does a woman listen to this and say ""Yes! Yes to this negativity and pessimism every day!"" 

She's going to meet a well-dressed man at a wedding with a twinkle in his eye who asks her to dance. And he'll casually mention that her boyfriend must not care about her all that much if he doesn't even bother to accompany a lovely, charming lass like her to such a fine event.  And they will make out like 
giggling teenagers under the stars between a couple of parked cars, and that will be that. 


But by all means,  continue to take your girlfriend for granted and be super negative and pretend that you're just being logical and reasonable instead of a huge lead anchor holding her back.  "
That's the thing with Russian roulette. It isn't problematic until it is.
"I had a summer birthday and the one day of summer birthdays kinda sucked. The rest of the class got their own day when they were the hero for bringing in cupcakes or whatever but for us summer birthday kids, we had to share with another 6 or 7 kids. Even worse, sometimes the teacher lumped the summer birthday party into the end of school party. Not cool. 

This was made even worse by the fact that all my friends were usually on vacation during my birthday, so my birthday parties were sparsely attended at best. It totally sucked. My mom finally started celebrating my half birthday for a couple years, and I loved having a winter half birthday I could celebrate with all my friends instead of a summer birthday. "
"It's hard to give very specific advice without more information on your exact situation/location than is appropriate for a thread like this, but:

* Is the situation *really* that bad, or are you depressed/defeatist/anxious about trying? If you step out of your comfort zone a bit, can you, say, take cooking courses, or art classes, or learn a new language?
* If the situation really is that bad, then it's likely you could benefit from moving somewhere with more people and activity. Obviously, the financial aspects of this are a complicated question.
* If there's nothing where you are and you can't move in the short term, what about looking for stuff online? Friends aren't less real just because your interaction with them is electronic. You may find groups that have less-frequent meetups you'd need to travel for, but that's something.

Do you have any existing hobbies or interests?"
"Honestly, you should apologize but don't try and get back with him.

"I personally don't really care about my birthday. I try to be super low key about it. However, if I was dating someone for whom birthdays are super important, like OP's girlfriend, as long as I wasn't comatose I would do anything I could to at least do *something* to acknowledge her on that day. 

I don't think our little side debate even matters though because it sounds like this argument was just the tipping point that brought the compatibility issues between OP and his girlfriend to light."
"Since most commenters think the girl was way inappropriate, let me present an alternative scenario.  Girl is immature and puts a lot of stock in getting presents for special occasions.  It's her birthday.  She comes home, bf is in bed.  ""Hey birthday girl.  I *thought about* taking you out to dinner, but... Hey I *thought* about getting you a gift but decided a fancy dinner....""  I had a dad who was a ""gonna do"" and I've dated guys who were ""gonna do.""  So maybe, in spite of the gifts you've given her, maybe you've been a ""gonna do"" a bit more than you realize?  But... you've broken up with her and she can find another place to live.  "
"It's hard to cut family out of your life even when the relationships are toxic. But say you decide not to take your brother in; what happens the next time you make a choice that makes your family angry? It's emotional blackmail, plain and simple, and you probably have experienced it on some level your whole life. Regardless, I hope you choose to keep your brother in your life even if it's not as his guardian. He sounds like a good kid who could be a great person with a little help and positive influence. "
"OP's question was ""how can I help my husband realize his own value as a father?"" so accusing her of not being on his side is overly harsh.

Second of all, OP's husband is talking about picking up the family and moving to another *state* over this. That will represent a major life change for OP and the children, so OP is absolutely not obligated to just go with it ""right or wrong"".  I'm not even saying it's necessarily wrong to move, but I think OP's husband needs to do a little better than ""I'm jealous so we're moving.""  Therapy might help them get to the bottom of that topic.

Also, I think ""child molester"" is a massive leap based on what OP wrote -- the much more common explanation of sibling rivalry seems more likely.  Moreover, if OP's husband genuinely suspects his brother of having inappropriate urges towards children, it's insane that he wouldn't share that with **his wife** and the mother of his kids.  You don't need court-of-law level evidence to say to your spouse ""Hey, I don't have a good feeling about allowing this person around our kids.""  "

"&gt; They were already fucking them willingly.

I honestly think that makes a huge difference. Regardless of how awful it is for younger girls of a minor age to be sexually active with older teens, that's just something that happens, especially in lower-income areas with a lack of good education. That's how you get 14- and 15-year-old teen moms. 

These girls were not tricked or bait-and-switched. They knew what they were getting into *because they were already doing it for free*. Getting some cash must've been just a bonus for them.

and i can fully understand why he wouldn't want his girl sleeping around guys she doesn't know. and yes, you know how to take care of yourself.. so does everyone until something bad actually happens. you're never 100% safe when travelling alone, do not make it that much more dangerous."

They both look bad. Which is why any relationship between them would be built on a rotten foundation.."

"&gt;I fundamentally disagree with you, even though I see and respect your point of view (thank you for sharing it).

Thank you for being so polite. =)

&gt; Jealousy is natural. But i's not intrinsic. And it's often deeply unhealthy and damaging.

I would disagree. Humans commonly bond to their partners and build lives together as a means for stability and safety. If an outside party attempts to interfere in that, it can trigger jealousy. This is fairly natural as you also stated. If it is natural, how can we argue - as is the case in many other comments - that flirting is natural and harmless, it's his biology, but jealousy, no matter how natural, is just bad? It *does* serve a biological purpose, she just isn't being afforded the same leniency he is. And this is why I think the flirting issue is more societal than biological, men are given passes that women are not because ""penis"". I don't buy that at all, I think it encourages/creates the behavior, damn near requires it, *and* excuses it all at once.

Compare jealousy to fear. Fear is natural, it's even good. You *should* be afraid of certain things, fear keeps you from getting yourself killed or severely injured. But if you are so fearful that you can't even leave your house, it's become a problem, a disorder. She hasn't mentioned any fits of rage or public meltdowns, she hasn't demanded that he cut all contact with females, she's been rather calm about the matter even as he brushes her aside, continues on anyways, and blames her. I don't see how this situation is damaging *because of her*. 

An example of ""bad"" jealousy would be flipping out any time your partner converses with the opposite sex no matter how mundane the conversation. This guy is actively encouraging flirtation in front of his wife to the point where a 25 minute hair cut took an hour of her sitting by the side waiting while he giggled like a school girl. Not cool.

Now, if he were married to a woman who didn't care, it would be fine. But he isn't so the situation needs to be considered logically with her needs in mind as well. If I had to pick which person was behaving more inappropriately it would be him. If my husband made me sit in a salon for an hour while he giggled with a woman while ignoring me, I'd have left, that's not how I want to spend my free time. I don't think he's a cheater, I don't even necessarily think he would cheat, but it's just not respectful to encourage flirting to this extent, make her sit and watch, and ignore her feelings. When you marry someone, you can't continue to go through life discounting their feelings; you should weigh them logically, yes, but he's just shutting her down when she's not really being illogical. As I said, it's not just *his* intentions that matter, he may not mean to cheat, but these women almost assuredly believe he's interested. Some couples find this kind of flirting healthy, many do not and that's okay. I think he likes the attention, he knows he's doing it, he has no intention of cheating, so he just continues. But being the wife, sitting off to the side while he does it, is kind of embarrassing. 

You might try to argue that he isn't flirting but you have to be aware of how you come off to the people around you, you don't exist in a vacuum; pretending that you do could land you in hot water at work or in your personal life if you just barrel through like a bull in a china shop. If I were single and a guy came in for a 20 minute haircut and kept chatting with me for an hour and I thought he was cute, yeah, I would start wondering if I could get his number. I'd react to the interest he seems to be showing me. It's very easy to see how over-interest and exaggerated behavior can be misleading. If I found out his wife had been sitting in the corner for an hour watching, I'd feel a little weird."

"You're 64, so well past the age of effectiveness, and even after the vaccines you can still contract HPV. There are dozens upon dozens of strains too. 

The vaccine, ideally taken as a teen for best results, lessens the likelihood that you'll develop the virus from those *particular* strains, but as I mentioned above the real bitch is that you can still get them even after the vaccines, even more so for you since you got the vaccines (yes, there's more than just one) late in life. STD rates in your age bracket are rather high too.

Most gynos won't test for HPV unless there's an issue or it's requested, so you could have really fucked your wife over more than just mentally."

"""Resort to this""? ""Better than ever"" meaning restricting yourself? Dude, you are putting off some major whiffs of shame around your entirely harmless fetish. It's just hair. It grows back!

I've done head-shaving kink stuff (down to the skin) and I had fun with it. Being bald made every outfit 100% more stylish. I wore big dangly earrings every day. Plus, the hair grows back incredibly fast and healthy! By 2 months of growth, I had a thick fuzzy cap of hair. By 4 months, it was long enough to style. I keep wanting to get it shaved again... maybe next year, haha!

Btw, your girlfriend is a submissive. She gets off on making you happy. It sounds like even though head-shaving started out as only your kink, but she's gotten into it as well. (People pick up sexual interests from their partners all the time, it's part of the fun of exploring!) It sounds like you're projecting your own guilt at being kinky onto her, and she's thinking of it as a fun sexy thing that she can do with you that you'll love and will leave her with a cute new look.

But seriously, you'll be so much happier if you can figure out why you feel so ashamed of being kinky. Go do some reading about how to negotiate consensual kink scenes. Have your girlfriend read too - she's been quite clumsy in her attempts to engage with you, but she can learn. Listen to her boundaries and desires and have her listen to yours. Talk about what you both would need for aftercare. See a kink-aware therapist. Because whether you and she do this scene or not, you shouldn't have to carry all this shame over a harmless quirk in your sexuality. "
"You're assuming she got with him just because he has money.  Most people are wealthier than artists, dude.  Especially in a major city.

"There is no such thing as ""not breakup worthy"".  He decided that the side of you you showed was something he didn't want to deal with and decided to end the relationship.

You don't ""get him to understand"" it.  It's over.  He broke up with you.  It's done.

And while I get being ""Michael Bolton""-ed (Office Space reference) can get really annoying because everybody thinks it's super funny to point out something, because for them it's kind of amusing, *you* have heard it all your life, I'll give a bit of advice.

You are way, way, *way* too old for this *triggered* bullshit.  ""Triggered"" typically, and properly refers to triggering a post traumatic stress induced incident.  When one is ""triggered"" in the proper sense it typically means flashbacks, panic attacks, and other *severely* crippling emotional and physical responses.

This is none of those things.  You aren't a sufferer of abuse or other traumatic event that went into a panic attack over something that triggered a post traumatic event.  You're a god damned nearly 30 year old adult who needs to learn to handle her temper better.  You flipped out over a (admittedly somewhat annoying and juvenile) joke and lost your shit.  And you got dumped for it.

You shouldn't be wondering ""how can I make him understand I was totally justified in flipping my shit like a child?"" and instead wondering ""how do I get my temper under control so I don't blow the next relationship I'm in?"""
"Sounds like you're trying to date to fill a void. That leads to desperation. You date people that you think you're superior, and suddenly there is no desperation so to you, it's easy. But when you start dating someone whom you value more because of their looks, you get desperate and suffocate the relationship. 

Focus on completing yourself instead of dating some ""hot girl"" to do it for you. 

Also maybe work on your attitude a bit. You come across as incredibly arrogant. "

"He maybe in police custody now, but in most cases it won't be for long. In most domestic violence cases the police NEED the victim to testify about the violence in order to convict but they won't. They may refuse giving a statement or retract the statement at a later date. The police need the victim in order to prosecute but the victim is in such a poor psychological state that it is hard to convince the victim that they NEED to send there abuser to jail. 

Where I live all the police can really do is place a temporary 'no contact' restraining order (up to 72 hours) and hope that the victim will go to the courthouse and apply for a long-term restraining order, when the victim refuses to co-operate.

The police do not have the legal power in domestic violence situations. The victim is the one with the legal power, unfortunately the abuser has made the victim feel so powerless they fear having the power."
But that obviously didn't accomplish anything. And he's still all buddy buddy with the guy. Actions speak louder than words.
"just awful, and awful awful person. an irresponsible, ignorant, negligent idiot."
you're welcome to keep telling yourself that lol
 I think him serving divorce papers is more likely to get your mom's head in the game than anything else you could do. Being served or even having divorce papers filed doesn't mean you have to go all the way to divorce. These things do pull some cheating spouses out of the affair fog. Facing real consequences make them take a good look at what they are actually doing and where that may lead.
"If you want monogamy, and she doesn't, you aren't compatible, and that's ok."
"35/32 is fine. 

It's about stage in life. 

When she was 14 he was 17. She was a kid, he was a horny teen.  Now at 16/19 she's still a schoolgirl and he isnt; he is someone who SHOULD be beginning to be an adult, dating someone who is still a kid.

 But as they age, the difference will get less important."

"&gt; What he compared it to is beside my point, it's still not okay. And yes they do, my mother had four kids and never screamed at my dad like that. 

Are you claiming you remember how your parents interacted when you were a newborn?"
"As it should be! I hope OP is reading all of these and taking note, she can do better"
"Yes, they're still considered Jewish. Being Jewish is all three of (a) an ethnicity, (b) a culture, and (c) and a religion, which is an unusual combination and I think can be confusing for outsiders. There's absolutely no doubt that they're ethnically Jewish, sounds like they're at least somewhat culturally Jewish, and they're not practicing religious Jews.

Worth noting that even non-practicing people can identify fairly strongly with a religion. For instance, I know families who would identify as Catholic even though they don't to church, they live together before marriage, etc. etc. Which just muddies the waters even further when it comes to Judaism."

This is one of the best and more hilarous comments I've read on this sub.
You don't have to tell her what they said to protect her. Just tell her you noted that they were actually jealous- something she might not have experienced before.  And express some concern that they might try to derail her happiness. That's what a good friend would do. 
"Wow you hate this dude, don't you? The contempt just drips."
That's not healthy. You could probably use a little time with a therapist if the minor inconveniences caused by others feel like personal slights. That's not a normal thing that a healthy person feels. 
"Well, you didn't marry the guy, so that's something. 

So there really are two people who you have to be able to look in the eye. Your brother and yourself. I honestly think that it will be possible one day. But it will be a long time coming.

For now, write your brother a note, explaining that:

1. You are, slowly, coming to realize just how badly you screwed up. One day you will need to sit down with your brother and a family counselor so that you can figure out if there will ever be a way that you can give him some sort of satisfying apology. But you're not so foolish as to think that day is today.

2. You will respect his desire for space, but you do want to hear from him.

3. You love him, and you want to figure out how to act in a way that shows it.

Give this to your brother, and then get some distance from all of this. At least you didn't marry the guy."
"That mom better get used to it.  Especially as her daughter grows, figures out her own preferences, and gets her own friends.  In my opinion, it's pretty stupid to name a kid something that has an obvious, common nickname and then take it as a personal insult when people use it.  

If I were you I wouldn't even apologize, since your boss already has.  Please try not to lose sleep over it.  "
"What we call ""gut feeling"" is simply another way for our brain to process information: sometimes we process it consciously, sometimes we process it without even knowing it. Our brain is alway collecting info from our senses, and it's always interpreting that information, weighting it and making decisions. Sometimes we are aware of those decisions, sometimes not. As any form of human decision-making, ""gut feeling"" isn't always right. 

Just sayin': because at the moment it seems to me that you (and we) don't have much information to determine if your boyfriend's dad is a creep or if you're simply not accustomed (and not really comfortable) with older people showing off too much emotion towards you. An advice: ***you can set boundaries while remaining polite***. As I said in another post, there are way too many people that don't consider the middle ground between ""doing nothing"" and ""bayonet charge"". If you're not comfortable with something or someone it's in your right setting boundaries: and in most cases (not in *every* case obviously) it's not only possible but also advisable doing that with politeness and consideration for other people."
"Thank you for understanding, and my best wishes to you. You sound like you have a great handle on your situation. Respect "
"Suggesting a therapist for having a type. For fucks sake 😂

There's nothing deep down she needs to discuss and be revealed that makes her like taller men. It's not some psychological flaw. It's thought to stem back from when we were more primitive, it was an advantage having a larger mate. We cannot help our tastes."
He's really saying that masturbating to children isn't child porn? Girl. 
This issue is much too big for Reddit. You both need counseling before adopting or bringing a child into the world.
"My husband had this problem for awhile. His parents were the type to (his entire childhood) be like ""hey, little 5 year old buddy, why don't you brush your teeth/clean room/not be an asshole??? Would you like that hmm???"" And he had very lax consequenses. Almost no consequences. 


So *I* had to teach him that daily showering and tooth brushing, flossing, and mouthwash were a requirement of living with me. Let alone sexing me.


His breath was *terrible* and he had TWELVE cavities and 2 teeth removed in the end. Even though he had started brushing his breath didn't get 100% better until the dental work got done. Now he's a normal non-stanky adult and I no longer have to nag him about his oral hygiene because all that dental work was painful enough he never wants to do it again :)"
If poolhouse were an option I would fake sick alll the time. 
"I am kind of a germaphobe. Someone having the flu doesn't bother me too much but once someone has a vomiting bug I will absolutely freak out. When I lived at home, when someone in my family was ill I shut *myself* away in my room. I am the one who has a problem, so I was the one who got to be shut away in a room. I would hoard a load of biscuits and snacks and just stay up there with tons of hand sanitiser and latex gloves. It isn't fair for him to push this on you."
"It's ok to talk about a future together but IMO, baby names are a bit too much until someone is actually pregnant. You don't even know if you'll be able to get pregnant together (what if one of you has fertility issues?). But, the bottom line is both of you have to agree on the baby name. If your gf doesn't like the girl name you chose, then find one that you both can agree with. "
"THIS! 

The only time I've seen this sort of radical behaviour change in people i know have been through drug induced psychotic episodes, or early stages of a mental breakdown/episode.

"Oh, well if she just threatens you constantly and is only violent around him and the kids then she sounds like Snow White.

You are in a domestic violence situation.  Please call your local hotline if you need more guidance.  Do NOT subject your child to this behavior and put your child in danger.  It is your responsibility as a mother to protect your baby from what you don't seem capable of protecting yourself from."
"I don't think this is too much micromanagement. When I went to college, my parents paid the bills online. We would pull up the tuition bill, food, board, whatever, and they would pay it straight up. I had some extra money from summer jobs to pay for extras. They gave me a credit card for gas for my car and books for the classes. But the credit card bill was mailed to my parents. So, they could see what I had spent it on.

When you're talking about *college* money, you're not talking about $20 here and $40 there. This is TENS OF THOUSANDS of dollars. If I was spending that much money on anything, I would want an itemized receipt. And why not? You worked hard for that money. If your son was paying for it out of his own pocket, I'd just say ""Welp, you totally screwed yourself. I can help you, but I can't force you to do anything.""

I don't know why anyone is saying you're micro-managing. I just spent over $8000 on a new air conditioner this week. How pissed would I be if I found out that new air conditioner is really a 21 year old guy playing video games? I'd be pissed and breathe over their shoulders as they put in a new air conditioner."
"&gt;Please don't suggest divorce

problem solved."
Thank you. I will try that
Because your best guy friend is probably interested in you more than platonically.  Ask him about why he's so focused on this topic and see what he says.  
"&gt;He tries to navigate but he doesn't tell me I need to make turns until too late.

That doesn't seem related to the side of the road you drive on, he's just bad at navigating. Try to explain what you need him to do very clearly, and if he still can't then you can just use a sat nav. 

&gt;Yes, he said he would drive. Now he's freaking out. 

I can see why that's frustrating for you, but as I said there's little you can do now. Perhaps for parts of the trip you can look into alternative transport methods?"
Pretending like this is natural will make you a lifelong cheater. You had perfect control over your actions and refusing to take responsibility for cheating is childish.
"Your wife is not the standard for everyone. You're being very flippant about something that could be quite dangerous.

Example: I have a friend with ADHD who has enormous difficulty remembering to do anything different at all on a route that she's driven before. For instance, she'll be on her way from home to work and she knows she needs to get gas, and then she'll arrive at work and realize she's totally forgotten to. I would be pretty terrified with her trying to learn to drive on the other side of the road -- she just can't flip a switch and change habits the way I can.

If she were moving to the UK permanently, then great, she should practice driving in a very tightly controlled environment for a long time and get to the point where her reflexes were different. But I wouldn't recommend that just if she were dating someone she visited every few months there."
Being sorry and repenting is just another part of the control and ctcle of abuse.
"She sucks, but so does your fiance.  He's as much a shitbag as she is, regardless of how sincere his confession may have been.  You just like him more, which is why you're keeping him around.  Your friends don't have that hierarchy because they aren't engaged to him, so if they're still friends with him, they probably recognize that it's only fair to still be friends with her.

And whatever, you can choose to stay with him, but you can't make your friends say, ""Alice, you're terrible, but OP still likes Ben, so he's allowed to stay and we don't hate him because she says we shouldn't."""
"Sorry to tell you this, but kissing does count as cheating.
 She Will probably go all defensive because you violated her privacy (which you did).
You obviously don't trust her or you wouldn't have gonne through her stuff. And she definitely wont trust you now. Are you sure this is the kind of relationship you want?"
"His physical health is better than most, he works out on a relatively consistent basis, eats well most of the time.

He rarely goes out, but he used to in his early twenties. I don't see his friends around anymore.

I've never heard of him dating anyone. He has a low opinion of himself. Most women his age are ready for marriage and kids, while he is struggling to support himself.

Therapy sounds like a good idea, but I certainly won't pay for it right now, and he can't either. 

Therapy is usually expensive yes? Hundreds per month?"

Not sure if this is the right answer but just had really freaking good sex with my fiance :p Is it just me or is it always better with fairy lights? 
"So have a new name that's not either. It's odd to have a firm boundary on forcing someone to take your name. I understand not wanting your kids to share a name with your wife's abusers, but that's specific to your wife. Not all women. "
I'm married and my SO has never treated me with anywhere near this amount of disrespect.

"just update her on the cleaning! ""hey, this and this worked, this didn't but I managed to find someone who did it for X amount of money—"" or ask her, before you do anything, whether she knows a way to take care of certain things/someone good to hire. it's not that big a deal, ask how she's doing now etc"
"Slim and fit women probably live a slim and fit lifestyle. Healthy eating, exercise/active. They are probably making an assumption the someone who is on the border of extreme overweight/obese does not share that lifestyle. You may think it's different for men, and men are more attractive being overweight, but your experiences are telling you something different. So either be very patient in finding the woman who will look beyond the physical (something you yourself have an issue with, so should understand how difficult that is) or work on adapting the lifestyle/look of the women you are into."
"It can last *years*. If she hasn't been back to the doctor since diagnosis or pursued treatment, she really needs to."
"OP, the best thing you can do is rip off the band-aid and tell her. Especially when you take your ages into account - women find themselves wanting to settle down and start a family a lot sooner than men, simply because by the time they hit their 30's, they begin running the clock on how possible it is to have children; each year that passes without these commitments is another year of running the risk that it won't work out. Getting married and having kids are two huge dealbreakers for a reason - you can't make yourself want to get married or have kids, and you can't make someone else give up those dreams (at least not without serious resentment).

If it does lead to you breaking up, at least she'll be able to find someone who wants the same things as her and won't beat around the bush until it's too late. "
"You knew the answer before you even posted on this thread so either move on from your ex and stop having 'sleepovers' (and no it is not like having a female friend over, seriously stop justifying it like that). **Or** break up with Brian. 

Don't be one of those people who ends up hurting their SO because you couldn't set boundaries with an ex. You don't have to stop being friends with your ex but you know as well as I do that your relationship isn't something Brian (or any partner) would be OK with cos' if you thought that you would've told Brian about these 'sleepovers'.

Tl;dr: stop being selfish and move on from your ex before you hurt Brian. Or break up with Brian because you are not ready for a relationship. "
"Just to back up the therapy suggestion..

I went through a stage when I would only eat cheesey bagels. Nothing else and I would only eat one every couple of days. I was severely underweight. I didn't have a traditional eating disorder - I didn't do it to be thin. But I had disordered eating and cheesey bagels were the only thing I felt safe eating. I needed help to get over this. "
"Oh my god girl, get out. Tell your landlord that your bf has rage issues and is scaring you. If he has *any* heart, he'll try and help you out of your lease. I'm sure there's something in your lease or local laws that would help you get out early anyways (although it's usually 60 days notice and extra rent), but if he knows you're scared of your angry bf he may be willing to waive some of those requirements.

It's easier to market an apartment over the summer anyway, so he may prefer some agreement where the two of you try to vacate by July or August 1st over giving him extra notice and rent, since the place is much more likely to be immediately snapped up than sit for a few months after you leave."
"The 1 year old wouldn't have been born yet (I'm assuming that's why SIL was in bedrest), putting her other daughter at 2-years-old at that time.  It sounds like they just did a small celebration at home, which makes total sense to me if mom is about to go into labor and your kid is only 2.

"&gt;Is it bad that I [20 M] scold my Mom

It's very bad. Your behaviour (as you describe it is here) conceited, callous, disrespectful, and cruel.

Your rationale is that you want to change her because she will be ""part of"" your life for a long time but in the long term your treatment of her will *damage* your relationship with your mother. She will be emotionally less close with you.

Responsive desire doesn't fit our cultural model of what 'desire' should be, so we're more likely to worry it's a problem that needs to be fixed. There is nothing wrong with you; I think you might be overthinking who initiates sex, and why, to the point that you're deeply unhappy with your perfectly normal desire. Get your hands on this book!"

"You have to love yourself enough not to be controlled by another person. You may not realize it, but his anger, threats to kill himself/break up with you, jealousy... it's because he feels out of control.

I mean... my perception of your relationship is only based upon what you've given us, so I don't know the full story. But I feel like you're not loving yourself, and your attraction to him (emotional, physical, etc.) is skewing your judgment."
"Damn straight. The only proper response to such a gift, no matter how much the recipient may not like it, is a gracious thank-you. That's what a grown woman does, whether or not she is currently pregnant. Jeez. (Also I want to see the frilly outfit, lol.)"

Also, OP, for sure mark her down as 'not quilt worthy' unless she comes to her senses ON HER OWN and apologizes. I say in her own, because really, for her to be quilt worthy she needs to figure out for herself just how much she goofed!

"Come on. You are just valuing your ""misery"" higher than her discomfort at being outside. 

You aren't experiencing misery, you're experiencing heat, just like about half of the US does during the summer. Unless you have a medical condition, it can be uncomfortable but it's not a health risk (as your wife has clearly demonstrated). 

She would rather be outside without you than inside with you, it seems, and you would rather be inside without her than outside with her. It's a choice you are both making. You're physically capable of going outside with her, so if you want to spend more time with her, do it and stop complaining. So you sweat a little. I promise itll be okay."

Getting a baby won't necessarily improve things, as the fundamental problem comes from the fact that she isn't satisfied with her day to day life. You're successful, and she would like to have a job that is as rewarding to her as yours is to you.

Depression will make her unwilling to look for change. She'll be afraid of the added risk of not finding anything good, adding another failure to the list. You need to help her past that. Take advantage of your stability to be a solid shoulder she can hold on to. Maybe ask your colleagues for advice. But help her find fulfilling work."
"Every time I went over to her place and I see her the most out of my whole family, the food and water bowls were always empty. The cat was forced to drink out of the toilet. The litter box was always disgusting and she never took him to the vet even though he has a wheeze, which might be caused from how nasty her apartment is, I'm not sure, but I set him with an appointment.

You are correct, my family 100% enables her.

I don't think she has any friends, except her ""boyfriend"" who is always too high to function. I'm not worried about him."
"I'm on the other side of this.  They get an actual bed, and they get a door and maybe a bathroom.

"...you're still a minor. How is it lucky that a 15 year old fell off a balcony? It's unlucky for ANYONE but if they're taking it to toddlers, maybe they should remember you're still in your early to mid teens if age is so important to them. "

"Does he have life insurance? Does his life insurance cover suicide missions?

This is a pretty good sized hill to die on. If he's not listening to you, you need to get everyone he respects in on this decision. His parents, church friends, pastors, uncles, siblings, teachers, college roommates. Publicly shame him out of this choice. Honestly I think it will be better in the long run if you are his nag wife who keeps him from fulfilling his mission or whatever the hell he thinks he's doing, than having to raise your children alone.

"Hello. FULL Filipino American here. Id like to say I think in different ways both of you are right. I think the reason why he thinks this way is to give your kid a defense mechanism. Growing up in America i've noticed its more socially acceptable to become racist to asians compared to other minority groups. So a defense mechanism should be developed.

BUT.

I think you're in the right because if the insults go too far you get racially self conscious biracials like the creatures in /r/hapas . From what i recall one of the reasons they're so racially self conscious is because their moms told them they're better than the Asian kids for being part White indirectly implying they're worst than the White kids for being Asian. This is a horrible thing to do to a child.

Anyways, the point of it all is i do believe your kid needs some form of calus to racism because whether or not you like it its gonna happen to your kid one day. But i dont think it should be to the point where he/she is self conscious about their race. 

Everything in moderation. Some light teasing here and there=Good. Full blown insults to race=Bad"

If you not wanting to be a human incubator to suit his personal preference leads to divorce, so be it."

'right to work' is with respect to unions, and applies to only 28 states in the US.

what you're looking for is 'at will', and that's every state in the US other than montana.

She isn't even overweight. I'm sure she looks great.
"No dude, far away or not, it's weird and disrespectful to check your phone during intimate times."
Offer to deal with phone calls for him. Also with lawyer (re his wife's death) and any other things he has to deal with but doesn't want to.  Help him do laundry. Vacuum.  Restock his fridge. 
"To be fair, 8 months still is a LONG time to lie to his coworkers and to his girlfriend. What else does he lie about ""for fun""?"
"Again, anything they'd say if you left ~~before~~ after 2 weeks, they would say anyway if you left now. In fact, 2 more weeks might make it worse. Stick to what you can control—your health, your dignity, and your faith in humanity to know they are buttholes who make up BS about other people."
"Just want to add to say I don't see this as a lack of strength on your part. Knowing your boundaries and having the ability to stand up for them takes strength. Learning what you need from a partner and how to express it is a process.

FWIW, I also dated a musician who sang lovingly about his exes &amp; dreams of infidelity, and it bothered me constantly. The more I asked for reassurance and patience, the more he defended himself &amp; retreated. Neither of us were wrong--we were just incompatible."
"So I recently had an ex FWB stay at my house - a month after my wedding. My husband has known since Day 1 that this guy was a FWB once upon a time, he's met the friend before and knows full well I would never do anything. My husband had to leave in the middle of the visit for a business trip and friend remained in our house.

The difference in my situation and OP's is that I as the one who was party to both relationships made it very clear to all involved what the situation was, what it is now, and made sure my husband was comfortable with it above all other things.

OP your husband wasn't forthcoming in any of the information he told you, nor did he answer you truthfully when you asked. Those are red flags and you are more than justified in saying you don't want this visit to continue."
"Yeah it's not far. 50% of your income is equivalent to his income. If he wants something outside your affordable means you're just going to be slowly perishing financially. 

I make much more then my SO and I don't ask him to pay for 50/50 because he is literally broke. I rather him have some savings then have 50/50 pay. "
Break up with your current LDR boyfriend asap. Your obviously not happy with it. 
"Yeah, in my brief stint in retail I worked at a place whose policy was a 15 minute break for every 4 full hours scheduled, plus a 30 minute lunch break for a shift of 8 hours.

Amazingly, most people always seemed to end up getting 7.5-hour shifts, so only one single 15 minute break.  Shorting the shifts that single half hour, in addition to knocking off a half hour's pay, also knocked off 45 minutes of break time.  Quite a deal from the management perspective.  But a hell of a shitty thing to do to employees to save $3.25 and squeeze out 15 extra minutes of work."
"You only want to tell him to get revenge on her. If you really felt sorry for him, you wouldn't have slept with her in the first place. You don't give a shit about him or his feelings.

So leave her to tell him if she wants to. It's their relationship and you need to butt out. It's nothing to do with you and it never was. Next time find a girl who's single."
"&gt; Maybe you can think of a reward for actually getting a degree, rather than for just being enrolled? The reward could be that he doesn't have to pay off his debt to you for those 5 months of doing nothing? But don't let that reward be a reason not to start him on a payment plan right now.

"I feel like the future version of you who stays with your bf. 

Please... I am divorcing a man who sounds JUST like your bf, after being together 12 years. I sounded just like you- always making excuses for his behavior, assuring myself that he did love me, believing his excuses behind when he was an asshole. And constantly cleaning up his messes.

He stole the money I put in our joint savings account- we were saving for a house. Actually, he never saved anything, it was all me. He said he was struggling with his credit card and would repay it- I believed him. He never repaid it. 

He hid multiple xanax addictions, which I only discovered when he went through withdrawal and I thought he had a bad flu and tried taking him to the hospital. He did this to me a few times, always swore it would never happen again.

He barely helped around the house, always made excuses and swore he'd try harder. He'd try for about a week, long enough to give me a tinge of hope, and stop. He thought yardwork (which I helped with) was enough.

He eventually started sexting other women and trying to have an affair. After I told him I couldn't handle being his ""mom"" for much longer. Instead of stepping up for me, he decided to step out. He even had an Ashley Madison profile!

Your bf is not capable of loving you. He thinks he does, but if he did, he would care about your frustrations and your time. He would insist on carrying his weight. He would make sacrifices to make your life easier. 

He's not doing any of that. I am you from the future- I wasted my 20s on this man, who is incapable of actual love. 

Please consider therapy- it's been the best thing I ever did for myself. It's helped me see reality, and take care of myself. 

I've only been separated since April, and my life is already SO MUCH better. I've even started dating a guy who actually is capable of love- I've never had someone be so kind to me in my life- he asks what HE can do for ME. He never blames me for anything, he's gracious, and generous, and kind. He brings ME water, and breakfast in bed, without expecting anything I return. He's grateful when I do things for him, and never just assumes something is my job. It's amazing, and I wish I had found him sooner. 

Please, please, pay attention to what people here are saying. You deserve better. If this man truly loved you, you wouldn't have to keep making excuses for him- he'd be making your life easier and better because that's what you do for someone you love.

Please start looking out for yourself, and stop wasting your time on him. Think if he would ever do any of the things you for him- he wouldn't. A true partner would, and more."
"Yeah, as someone who loves swimming and the ocean and boats people are being SO cavalier here. I grew up a few blocks from a lake and went swimming there every summer, and every couple years a kid would drown. It's great to love fishing and all but having a lake literally in your backyard while your kids are growing up seems like asking for trouble to me..."
"Some people don't mind friends having sleepovers but I think everyone minds if it's with an ex.   You can be friends with your ex but you should def. considering cutting back on sleepovers.  And your ex probably still has feelings for you I would imagine even if they're not romantic feelings, there's still this attachment.  He's just denying it.  You're not kids, you're adults.  You guys used to sexually sleep together so anyone would be uncomfortable with this level of intimacy. Some are even uncomfortable even if it's a same sex friend which I don't really understand if you're straight but whatevs.  people have their dealbreakers and preferences."
Yes.  People don't always recognize that a patent is a manipulative narcissist.
That chance is higher than 1 in 6.
"I was thinking the same thing! It's sad that's she's broken free of that much debt and getting ready to soar and her mother is acting this way. I wonder if it's jealousy? Regardless, you fly high , OP!"
"It might help to split this into two problems. One, she's flakey. Two, she makes promises she won't keep in order to avoid conflict. Separating them might be useful.

There may not be much you can do directly about problem one because you can't manage someone else's time for them. You've told her that it's disrespectful and hurts you, she says ""That's not true!"" and continues to do what she wants. That's kind of all you can do directly on that issue.

It's possible that addressing problem two will actually have an indirect effect on problem one. It seems very clear that she knows you're upset, can't handle it, and keeps making promises to avoid a fight. That's completely unacceptable, but focusing on her blowing you off doesn't actually address that problem. She's not, like, losing track of time. The actual issue is that she's scared of saying no. Try tackling that directly. 

It sounds like she is terrified of people being disappointed with her, and she seems to think that if she never directly says no then they're the one with the problem and she's off the hook. Take her trip to her parent's house. She's supposed to meet you, her mom wants help making dinner, her friend wants a ride, she wants to placate you by bringing you dinner, you both want her to have the clothes. So she says yes to all of you and convinces herself that fixes it. She can say yes to everything by pretending that timing isn't a concern, only task completion matters. She said she'd bring you food! It's not HER fault you got impatient! Or her friend with the break-up. He wants to talk, you want to hang out. So she talks AND hangs out. It's not HER fault you decided to stand on her porch for an hour! She showed up to hang out! She did her end of the deal!

She needs to come to terms with this about herself. If you're invested enough to want to work through this, you might be able to help by telling her that it's inevitable her actions will contribute to people being disappointed, and that's okay. Yes, it's possible to disappoint someone so much a relationship ends, but she has a very unrealistic view of how that occurs. There are degrees of disappointment, and her current coping mechanism is actually making it worse. You will be disappointed if she cancels because something else came up, you will be MORE disappointed if you waste six hours waiting for her. Her friend will be disappointed if she can't get a ride, but that's a last-minute request and most people won't be angry if it doesn't work out. You will be MORE disappointed if the thing you scheduled your day around doesn't happen. You can handle plans being outright cancelled occasionally because something important came up, but you can't handle waiting around for hours on end.

If she's open to it, resolving problem two may resolve problem one. It doesn't sound like she simply can't keep track of time, it sounds like she's a people-pleaser with a really bad coping mechanism. It might be more effective to address that."
so pander to her ridiculous insecurities and lie to her about it?

"&gt; ""you should just be happy on your own"" b.s.

That advice is a pain in the ass because it's useless on it's own, but nevertheless true.

If you're comfortable with your single life and who you are, you will not be desperate to get into a relationship any more. Like it or not, people can *smell* desperation a mile away, especially on an arranged date. Ultimately the only ways to get past that are:

* Learn to mask your desperation really well (yeah good luck).

* Engineer situations where they other person doesn't consider it a date and isn't on high alert (not gonna pull this off with online dating, natch).

* Get yourself into a place where you're not desperate any more &lt;--- HENCE THE ADVICE

Any potential partner is going to respond well if they genuinely believe you are into *them*, but there is nobody in this world who will respond positively if they get a hint that you're more into *a relationship* than them specifically."
"Mountain Dew of all things. WTF.

Hell yes your friend is pissed, and she should be. Your husband isn't a safe person to have around kids even when given explicit instructions by the child's parent. Damn.

You can't fix this. Apologize to your friend on behalf of your husband and drop it. If you're lucky she may trust him again one day."

"Trauma does horrible things. You've had the resilience and drive necessary to recover. He's been hurt beyond his ability to heal up (at least for now). There may be some learned helplessness too. There's not much you can do to patch him up. But here's some ideas.

Why not concentrate on spending time with him doing something pleasant that's out of the house? There's the gym as you mention. But what about a little hike? Or a picnic at the park? Or a movie out? Or board/console games at your place? Or gardening? What about listening to music? Whatever. The idea is to make happy memories. So that your brother might see that there's more to life than somber thoughts and trauma (and maybe he finds a hobby or preferred activities!). So that you guys build up lasting shared memories that are pleasant and good. You'll both cherish them. So that you won't feel so frustrated by your brother. 

Try speaking to a mental health professional who treats people like your brother. The idea is to get their input. Maybe they have ideas for things you could try. Maybe they can advise. At the very least they can listen to your frustration and help you figure out ways to cope.

Consider that it's possible that whatever you've been through, your big bro has been through worse. Often times, the older sibling deals with the worse of the abuse. The older sibling 'sacrifices' himself or herself to shield the younger ones, and takes the beatings. The older sibling, due to age, is also acutely more aware of all that's happening that's messed up (while the younger ones don't fully realize yet). The older sibling also often ends up 'parentalized', assuming the care of the younger ones. In one of my friends' cases, this added stress and trauma has resulted in the older sibling committing suicide. For the others, the older sibling is definitely more messed up in adult life. Maybe something like that is what happened with your brother. 

You're a good brother looking out for him. I hope you don't burn out and lose hope. "
"Yeah, ""she gives good sex amirite boys"" is obnoxious but forgiveable. ""She gives good sex *and it's the only reason I haven't dumped her*"" is a disgusting thing to say."
"I fully expected to read this and think you were overreacting. However, if I saw pictures of my boyfriend and he had a girl in his lap, she was pressed up against his chest on a wall, etc. I would be put off. I have male friends and I am a physically affectionate person, but I would not sit on their laps or cuddle against a wall. 

I'm not saying dump her outright, but it might be worth it to ask about them. Bring up your feelings. Adult relationships are built on communication, and it will help in the long run if you two are open and honest about your feelings and hear each other out. If you want to be with this girl, you have to accept that you both view physical affection differently and find a balance. 

What also worries me is that from your other comments it doesn't sound like she respect your feelings. Sure, maybe to her it's no big deal, and if she posted them on facebook it's probably innocent. However, if you are telling her your are uncomfortable with something and she is brushing it off, or saying ""well that' just how I am, deal with it"" or writing you off as overreacting, she isn't actually listening to your feelings. A more adult response from her would be ""To me, it didn't mean anything, but I understand it makes you uncomfortable so in the future I will be more aware of my physicaly actions and how they can be construed."""
"I sort of (think I) get where OP might be concerned though, in that WHICH ONE of these shades is really you? Which one is your happiest, and if it's not the one with me, why?

"Maybe, but not necessarily. If she posted here, her pov might be something like:

&gt;I went on an exchange program and would text my boyfriend everyday and try to call and talk to him, I'd write him letters and I missed him a lot. He'd promise to text me, call me, or write me, but most of the time he just never would. He'd answer maybe a couple texts a week, not sending his own first, and it's really made me reconsider things about our relationship. 

&gt;I'm in a new and exciting place and I've made new friends and I have been experiencing new things. I feel like this relationship might not be what I need anymore. It sounds bad, but I've met a guy and while I have been faithful, just the fact that I have been noticing him and 'wondering' feels like evidence my relationship isnt good anymore. I love my boyfriend, but I don't think that's enough anymore. The fact that he couldn't even text me when I was out of his sight and things required a bit more effort really changed my perception of him. 

&gt;I plan to break up when I get back home after having a talk with him because I feel he at least deserves that. Am I doing the right thing? "
"I disagree that an inability to do chores and hold up his end of an agreement he made to his partner is in his nature and thus out of his control. Men are not hard wired in a way that makes them incapable of doing chores thoroughly and regularly. Women are not born with an innate talent or love for housework, either.

He absolutely can change, the issue is whether he cares enough about this relationship to change. My (male) partner wasn't the best with doing his share of chores when we first moved in together. But I refused to be a doormat and I continued to bring up the uneven division of labor. I held him accountable. We worked out a system and when he'd start to slip, I would call him the fuck out. 

He does his share now. It's not always perfectly 50/50 (and occasionally I fall behind and he picks up my slack) but he does the amount of chores I need him to to feel valued and not like I'm a live in fuck maid. Incredibly, it turns out he is perfectly capable of running a vacuum and scrubbing a toilet.

It's toxic to say that guys like this cannot change because it's ""their nature"" to be unhelpful, useless partners. That's simply not true. You are perpetuating a stereotype that harms many peoples relationships. Men are JUST as capable as women when it comes to maintaining their home."
"Honestly, what's he going to do about it? I wouldn't normally advise this type of unilateral decision-making, but he's left you no options. You need to look out for yourself, at this point.

* Buy a generic roomba, they're cheap at walmart. Make funny cat videos with it...the kids will be entertained!  
* Hire a cleaner...or stop cleaning until he hires one. (These people need jobs too, btw...hiring cleaners is a good use of money.)
* Basically, just do what you need and let him deal with it. No sense in you being a good teammember if he isn't. Maybe he'll come to see this blindside of his and change...or maybe he won't, but at least you'll have a roomba!"
"Move out without telling him and don't leave your forwarding address. Change your phone number. If he tracks you down at work , get a restraining order. "
"This is rough. I have been in your boyfriend's shoes or similar *twice,* and wasn't able to overcome it.

In both cases, my affection didn't change, and my attraction didn't either. And it was just occasionally a barrier to intimacy. (Granted, the first time I had to stop having sex because I couldn't get my mind clear was probably the moment things started going steeply downhill.) 

But it did turn off that magic *whatever* that makes a relationship serious enough to consider taking up a notch. Going from marriage material to ""ok for now."" 

If this happened now, knowing myself better, I wouldn't even try to push through it. Possible, maybe, but I spent so long trying last time that I don't think I have it in me to try again. "
"And generally a relationship comes with ""I WONT fuck your friend"". If you're not sure you can ever forgive him then how can you stay with him?"

Good luck to you man,you deserve better do not waste your youth on an a**hole."
"True, my SO is wonderful and I should not take him for granted. Thank you."
"If I were your SO I would already be making plans to leave you.

Go to your SO, say you were wrong in inviting them into your shared house and say you will take responsibility for making them leave.  You may need to get legal advise depending on how long they have live do there and where's you live to make sure that you don't fall fowl of any tenancy laws, even though they are not paying rent.  You need to lead this.  You can ask your SO for back up, but you need to make the changes.

You'll probably need to give them notice of about 30 days to leave depending on law in your area.  While you are waiting for that's time to pass make life as uncomfortable as you can for your parents while they are under notice of eviction, change the wifi password, cancel the TV subscription, do not buy them food, do any of their cooking, laundry etc.  If they leave their crap around pick it up and put it black bin liners and chuck them in the garden.  Don't let them smoke in your house.  (I'd also preempt things and make sure my valuables were stored safely offsite).

Once they are gone, you are going to have to make it up to your SO something huge.  The only way you can save your relationship with your SO is to stand up for him and your relationship.  If you let your parents walk all over you with your manipulation you will lose him.  It may already be too late. You need to do it right now.  Don't wait for it to get better.  It won't.  Go and have that conversation right now."
"Yes, the emotional labour one describes a lot of the posts that pop up here, I think. "
"Each person is paying $250. The people who are in a couple get to sleep in a bed, in a nicer area, for their money. The single people get to sleep on the floor, in a less desirable area, for their money. Each person is paying the same amount but getting different accommodations.

By the same logic that couples are paying more so they deserve more, you could say the group of three single people is paying more than the couples, so the group of single people should get better accommodations than the couples."
"&gt;At this point the stress of being forced into not a lot of options is only building up more stress for me, and not helping to push me in a positive direction.

You only ever had two options: go back to school, or not go back to school. 
Nothing's changed on that score. It's just that your parents have taken steps to make ""not going back to school"" a *less appealing, less attractive* option. 

You get sick, you get bedrest. But after a while, bedrest ends, because you've had time to heal and recover. 

&gt; it feel like you are implying that before the last few weeks, I have not been trying to make progress or worrying about my future, and that is the one thing that I really disagree with.

How would anyone who is not inside your head be able to assess or judge that? How would anyone other than your confidential therapist have any indication as to what progress you are or are not making?

&gt;I have been worried about my future and what I will do. 

Again, like stress over returning, this is a constant factor of life. This is a subject you will struggle with, and revisit, over and over and over again in your adult life. And your life, be it education or employment or romance, *will not wait on standby* for you to ponder this. You're going to have to multitask on this one, sport.

&gt;I have been applying for full-time jobs to try to get better work experience which will help me a lot outside of school

...so to help you *after* you graduate school, you want to work a full-time job now, instead of going back to school? Not sure I follow the reasoning there. It would seem that working full-time would both keep you from going back to school, and take a lot of time &amp; energy away from the work you're doing on your emotions and behavior patterns. That seems like a step in the wrong direction as far as ""being ready"" to return to school, at least from the perspective of a person not inside your head. 

&gt;...not feel open to make my own progress at the pace that is comfortable for me

And there's another flaw in reasoning. Some things are never going to happen at a *comfortable* pace. Some things **can't** happen at a comfortable pace; they're meant to be challenging and difficult. You can absolutely walk on a treadmill at a comfortable pace, but you won't get much exercise benefit from doing so; you build muscle and cardio from jogging at an uncomfortable pace. 

You **don't** have to go back to school. But you don't get endless bed-rest either. If you broke your leg, you'd be in bed for a while, but then it would be time for crutches, then physical therapy and getting back on that leg. That's where you are, now, getting pushed out of bed and having to put some weight back on the leg. 

You can do this. It'll be uncomfortable, but there's no version of this that ends with you happy and healthy that **doesn't** include uncomfortable bits. Fighting and arguing that it *should* be easy, comfortable, and at your own pace is simply denying reality, so knock it off. "
Seems like it has really upset him that he was not able to control you. I would be wary. 
"It's up to you if you want to ""wait"", but I don't know man, there is something really off about this girl.

I'm female. Both my partner and I look at porn. I would not be happy with him posting porn of himself online. It's not complicated or some massive gender war issue. It's just being monogamous.
"You described two situations as examples of your gf's behavior. You could have cherry-picked her worst moments, so we are assuming you have. Yet you come out looking like a momma's boy in both. You need to get some distance from them and a spine if you want an adult relationship."

"So you meet they guy, he tells you his ex is pregnant, and pretty much immediately you agree to raise that child with him? Before even getting to know him?

If you and your now-husband were planning to raise the baby before it was even born, how did you know she was a bad mother? "
I thought this too. If OP was legit being creepy I don't think she would have gone out of her way to tell him that he hadn't done anything.
Yeah that is disconcerting. Your therapist sounds like exactly the right person to talk to about this. Cannot encourage you to talk to them enough.
Couples counseling doesn't work when one partner is abusive.  It just arms the abuser with more ammunition to use against their victim.
He makes up a fake age whenever he posts to reduce doxing potential.

"The best way to deal with this: *stick to the plan*.

Other people turn up to an event? Well and good, but the date is set and it's going ahead with whoever is there. Other events spin out of that? Let whoever does the spinning take the lead.

"It's honestly pretty common at your age to want to regress a bit from social interaction as you are at an age when you are developing your adult identity and likely beginning to feel the insecurities about your choices building up.  You are finding flaws in others and mentally exaggerating them as a defense mechanism, judging them before they have a chance to judge you.  You're going through a phase of life when you are more vulnerable and inexperienced than you have ever been, at least with regard to the much more expansive world you have entered, i.e. obviously, you were less experienced at sex and relationships when you were 5-years-old, but those things really weren't on the radar back then.  For better or worse, the only solution lies in practice and putting yourself out.  You have to face the fears and sense of vulnerability, spending time with people and giving them the benefit of the doubt.  Making the conscious effort to look for their good parts as well as their bad, thinking of how these people can be beneficial to you as opposed to possibly hurting you.  You also have to share the more ""embarrassing"" parts of yourself (i.e. the personal stuff you wouldn't typically think to share with others) to prove to yourself that the world won't end or that people won't hate you for the things you like.  In fact, you'll generally (though not always) find that you build closeness with people by exactly this kind of sharing.

With all that said, depression is also a pretty common issue that you should consider speaking with a mental health professional about.  It does seem like the declining interest in others coupled with a lowered capacity for emotional investment goes pretty well with the possibility of you being depressed, so a professional can help you diagnose it and hopefully figure out the best way to get it under management."
"&gt; he's probably a 6 on the Kinsey scale

So you're saying there's a chance!

Just kidding. Sort of. Good luck!"
"I have a friend who is on the way out, that there is a saying among all of us that know him.

""Telephone, telegraph, tele-Chris are all guaranteed to spread your secrets further than you expect."""
"Ah yeah then it's hard to judge why he's behaving this way. Doesn't sound like your fiance did anything wrong though...  
If you have siblings maybe, they have encountered similar behavior?"
It doesn't happen to everyone. I cleaned out zero closets and obsessed about zero baseboards or whatever during the last weeks of my pregnancy. I was just exhausted all the time!
"OP, I was once in your situation, but thankfully my partner stopped and communicated with me:

You're not being abused if your partner never asked for this. The IF is important and I'm going to assume that he didn't. Let me explain.

First off. If he didn't ask for the help, it's nice to pitch in, but you should likely ask what's okay to do. Likely it sounds like you're making yourself comfortable, but in doing so, you're getting mad that he isn't thankful.

When I first started sleeping over at my partner's (we've been together since 2008 now) house, he wouldn't notice when I did things and I'd sulk. You have to realize that doing things like cleaning because his standard of clean, well stocked fridge, properly washed clothes, clean bathroom, when to take out the trash when to wash the sheets or other gross or annoying things (my partner didn't do all of this I'm just thinking if shit I've seen) might not agree with everyone else. 

So when you adjust things to make your extended time there better, they might secretly HATE it.


Some of it also they might like, or you might be doing and it's sweet but it's not required which is stuff like dinner being on the table when he gets home. To consider: if he isn't too greatful it may be  because some people don't eat that early in the evening, and because people want time to quietly decompress. 

Also he's a messy person it sounds like. You can't make someone who is the person in control of the residence change their cleaning habits just because you want them to. I mean it's gross that they missed the trash can, but it's also not your house for you to demand that they go pick it up. 

You're basically a very demanding guest that likely gave herself housewifey chores

Keep in mind you live in an apartment things will still be 50/50, so you still can't command that he stand up and fix things now. 

While he's not abusing you, it's likely a hint that you're not well matched.  "
"&gt;I have always wanted to raise my family as Catholic. ... I have made it very clear from the beginning.

I suppose the main question is: Has he been equally clear FROM THE BEGINNING?

Basically, did you marry each other knowing this about each other?

If yes, why did you marry someone fundamentally incompatible?

if no, why didnt you discuss this, if it is so important, before marrying.


&gt;He has accused me of trying to force him and guilt him into a religion. 

Well that IS what you are doing!

&gt;I feel like I have sacrificed so many important aspects of my life that he could do this one thing for me.

Right, you'd like him to hypocritically mock your deeply held religion, by coming to a service he does not believe in, in a church he despises? You think God will fall for that?

And anyway thats not how sacrifice works. You moved FOR THE GOOD OF THE TEAM. You want him to lie and fake ann interest in something he despises FOR YOU. Do you see the difference?

1. Do not have children with this man. Religious differences will make your lives, and their lives, intolerable.

2. You need to get divorced. Oh wait, catholic. Yeah, well, you are fucked. He WILL divorce you if you dont drop this. 

TLDR: You made  a huge mistake. You need to let this go. Now. "
"I'm sure they can tell, at least on some level."
Ok thank you. 
"Does he know that there was a trust coming in to you and how much it would be? Given your ages, it may throw him for a loop if he didn't know. He may have expected this age to be around 28-30 so it will take a conversation, and you may find out he would still like to wait until a certain age to start a family. "
Anecdotal evidence and gender norms. 
"I'm of the opinion this was an asshole move.

Sorry, but I wouldn't invite an ex (FWB *or* otherwise) over to sleep within vicinity of me without my SO having an educated say and equal decision.

It's not like he didn't know."
"Why is breaking up out of the question? He sexually assaulted you, you shouldn't ever trust him again. This should be an instant deal breaker."
Why did you do a sniff test? Seriously why? That's just unbelievable
"&gt;implied consent is quite subjective.

The first time you are having sex with someone, there is no implied consent to do any of these things.  There is nothing subjective about it.  

Sure if the last 15 times my partner and I had sex I let her slap my face, I could see an argument for there being implied consent the 16th time, but not the first time.

I like having my face slapped, I like breath play.  I actively seek out partners to do these things to me, and, if asked, I'm down to do them with almost anyone I trust enough to have sex with.  But if someone sprung them on me without checking first - without even so much as asking if I liked it - I'd be gone as soon as I felt I could safely get out of there (and I'd give a lot of thought to calling the cops and reporting an assault once I did).

This is not an implied consent kind of situation, it's an assault."
"Start by trying to understand why this is making you uncomfortable. Is it that you simply don't like the way he looks in those outfits? Is this turning you off sexually? Are you worried he might recognise he is gay and leave you? Is your femininity threatened by this? Something else? Try to get to the bottom of it, and then communicate that to him. Also encourage him to talk through how he feels as he is experimenting with this. Basically, keep all communication lines open. I personally think men can look super hot wearing make up (and not just David Bowie!), but you have to see how you feel about it yourself. "
"It's been two weeks and her need to micromanage you is a habit that she has developed over years. Give it time, let her get used to the idea of you helping out more and **then** see if there is a change.  Better yet, look and see if there is a change you are missing now?

&gt; Just last night for example I was laying in bed to relax/go to sleep and she calls me from the living room to turn the AC on. She was changing our daughter so naturally it couldn't wait (the AC is in the living room 5 feet from where she was). 

That does not seem like a big deal to me at all. If my girlfriend asked me to do something like that for her I would gladly do it. 

If having to get up and turn on the AC for your fiance while she changes your babies diaper is a big deal, then I think you need to get your priorities straight. 

Maybe hands deep in poopy diaper while you relaxed may have not been the best time to ask you to turn on the AC, but dude.. poopy diapers.. help the lady out. 

**Edit - Never mind, read below, if OP is telling the truth then she is the one who needs to work on helping out more, and rightly he should feel under appreciated.**"
"If you have a strong sense of self and personal dignity, maybe approach it from the angle of how blatantly and bare-faced his disrespect of you was.  He put you in a position where you sat at home, waiting for him and texting him and wishing he was home, while he ignored you and had sex with a hookup.  What a humiliating situation to be placed in, to be kept waiting around by a man who isn't worth giving the time of day to.  Don't compound the error with rose-colored glasses and nostalgia for a relationship that ended the moment he chose to leave you hanging so he could bang a rando."
Bingo. When I was 21 I was working three jobs which equated to about 60 hours a week and I was going to school part-time. This is not an age thing. This is a spoiled thing.
"The problem here is that she. is. not. fat. Not to mention she was fucking pregnant. When your body weight accounts for two people can you really call her obese? 130lbs at 5'6"" is not obese. The breastfeeding calories thing is not a lie (just? Google it?), and losing weight takes time, not to mention for most women your body won't just go back to normal instantly after your stomach goes from being giant and round to not having a child inside it anymore.

"Yes, I feel sad for these kids that they're not getting the exposure to social and interaction skills that I can't provide."

"&gt; she told me that she could start making it a weekly thing just for me if I wanted... all I had to do was ask.

She flirts with a guy who is taken, pouts when he moves away, then offers to make the muffins  a ""special"" thing just for him....

To be honest I think you should do it. She sounds like someone who will twist and turn everything you do to fit into her 'OP is gay' story. But at least you have confronted her about it. People are not used to being confronted. 
"Parents don't get that kids have friends sometimes. They don't get that excluding them from social activities damages them. I'm 28 and still have never had a birthday party. My birthday falls just after thanksgiving so when my family would celebrate the holiday, my birthday got lumped in. My cake was pumpkin pie and I never got gifts. My parents probably never knew better either which sucks. "
"She picked him up dinner and took it to his house he lives in alone, and did not tell you about this until you confronted her with evidence? Not a likely story this is closure. Closure is sending a key back in the mail. 

She probably cheated."

"Check your local legal aid society - they often have free assistance for people in need. You certainly qualify. A C&amp;D does not carry punitive force unless she continues to violate it, and it conveys a very clear warning of the penalties of this behavior.

"It's because you are too understanding and probably always try to give your partners the benefit of the doubt even when they don't deserve it.

If this is the case then OP's husband still kind of screwed up here.

If the husband isn't jealous then he definitely has some communication skills he needs to work on!"
"You've tried mentioning it, but when you want something, it's best to be as direct as possible. Try a script like,


""Boyfriend, I appreciate your concern for my consent, but at this point in our relationship it's too much. I want you to stop asking for permission before doing things. I need you to trust me, in that I will let you know if something is happening that I don't want or like.""

"Thank you for taking the time to write this out. I have been considering a roommate and renting an apartment, but I would really like to find a job first. I guess that's where I'm conflicted. If I could land a job, I'd like to move somewhere near the area (my car is actually his car and under his name so I wouldn't be able to take it with me). But I have not been having much luck and will need to look into areas farther out. 

The only friends I have now are online friends, who know of my situation and check up on me weekly. My old friends I could reach out to, I will do so in some sort of electronic correspondence as I wouldn't want anything overheard. "
"No, I read that too, but I feel like while saying those things, he still uses negative words to describe that side of her that he claims he'd like. If he thinks the song she danced to is a stupid song, and her limerick is bad, and he describes how she behaved as contrary to the smart woman she is with him, it seems like he isn't in favour of that side of her.

If she did dance to a song that wasn't good enough for them in front of him, would he correct her on it? If she made a dirty joke, would he have been put out by that? He may have been sending her signals that he doesn't like that type of thing and that's why she doesn't do those things with him."
"&gt; It made breaking up more logistically annoying but it was fine.

I think that's the key. OP is pretty young, sure, but they've been dating long enough that it's not crazy to move in together.

But if either of them isn't 100% invested in the relationship and there's a chance they'll break up any time soon, it is just such a fucking hassle to break up when you live with someone."
"Yes, it's perfectly fine. It's healthy. It's normal. Unless he is not able to get it up, then you have zero to worry about and you're making an issue and drama out of nothing.

Edit: and yes, some girls get wet without being touched. That's also normal. Quit your body shaming."

A year is really fast to get engaged. You're still in the honeymoon phase. It takes *years* to get to know someone well.
"You sound very similar to my fiancé. He took klonopin for his anxiety and panic attacks that would triggered by new situations/transportation. His panic attacks have decreased dramatically. I can say, from experience, being with somebody like this was hard.

I respond with his story because my fiancé because you sound like you're in a similar emotional state right now. Multiple panic attacks a week was what my early relationship was like. My early relationship was also filled with my fiancé being angry at me because he was actually angry/disappointed at himself during his worst bouts of anxiety. He was filled with anger/sadness because he was so so so so so afraid. It didn't help that his memory seemed bad after all those years of anti-anxiety medication (at least that's what he attributes to it, that or pot).

Everything is peachy keen now that his anxiety has mostly become better. Instead of worrying about trains and taxis now, we've moved onto planes and different countries.

Since there isn't any information on specific examples of who was gaslighting who, I'm going to base my response on my experience of a very similar person/relationship. I think your anxiety needs to be controlled better and that it should prioritize who the gas lighter is. Then you'll have a clearer picture of your relationship."
"If you stay with him, one day when he hates his life it will all be your fault. You will be the reason he never traveled, never succeeded, never got the job he wanted.

"&gt;Ask your wife who she considers her best friend. Judging by the way she's reacting, she thought it was you. Don't make her second guess that.

I would be shocked if she isn't already second guessing it.

His family already loves her and would be thrilled to have her as the stepmom.

"
"What? I don't think you know what she's talking about. Being a ""cool girl"" means letting him do whatever he wants, just being one of the guys, pretending like you don't have feelings about certain things, basically trying to live up to this perfect, sexy girlfriend who never disagrees and is up for anything. It's not a control thing, it's an insecurity thing. Lots of us have had to learn to grow out of the ""cool girl"" phase."
Holy hell OP leave leave leaaaavvveeee! 
"This is literally the last few months you and your wife will have alone together for the next 18 years. If you still want to be married to her by the time your child graduates high school, I suggest you use the remainder of her pregnancy to focus on your relationship with her and not with Sam. Right now your wife is upset (and rightly so). She is carrying your child, not Sam. If you want to help relieve stress, do laundry or dishes, clean the bathroom. Do any household task that your wife usually does, and do it without being asked. She'll be grateful for the help and you won't put yourself in a position where your good intentions get you in trouble."

"Go for it! Things are hard right now because you're adjusting to how things turned out and how unfair they are, but you are still your own person, with your own skills and the potential to learn more. There's this lyric by The Killers that's always stuck with me, which says ""And if they drag you through the mud, it doesn't change what's in your blood"". Just remember that the actions of others do not reflect on who you are as a person. You did what you had to do for yourself and your son, even though it wasn't the easy thing to do. That took strength, and is admirable in its own way."

"Let me just say that I think the whole situation is bizarre (her friends' opinions are stupid, and if she's just using that as an excuse because she doesn't want to help you move, that's a really bad sign).

However, I also think it's totally valid to not want to help someone move. Yes, a relationship is about being a team (although 4 months is...not that serious yet), but moving is a pain in the ass. I don't make a lot of money, but unless it's just a couple boxes, when I move I hire movers. Because I don't like it when my back aches, and I don't like worrying about injuring myself (which has happened in past moves). I don't think it's wrong of her to not want to help. If the sexist stuff is really an excuse, then it's the *way* she's going about it (not being honest about it) that's the red flag. "

She needs to make friends and develop a hobby. Send her to some meet up groups.

Also offer some structured date night.

Also wondering how is the sex life.  Is she submissive in bed? Some of what you described is submissive behavior. If maybe she kinda wants you to be more assertive but lacks the vocab to say it. Just wondering if this was an overall thing with her."
"The trick is to emphasize the word dad. It drives home that the cute little teen you're looking to bag doesn't see you as a mature, cool hottie, she sees you as a dad aka an old, boring, out of touch dork.

"Wow, that is pretty astoundingly dumb, and a shocking thing to do considering your feelings on this mess.  While you ought to sit down and make your stance clear on all this, you have also done so a lot in the past only to be given empty promises and feet-dragging.  At a certain point, actions (or inaction) speak louder than words.  He just seems fundamentally ill-equipped for adult financial and marital responsibility.  Small wonder he spent so much time in his ex wife's orbit.  He's still in it, really."
"that's ridiculous, a lot of the comments here lack perspective it seems. it's clear com2 was working on the logistics of the offer and didn't want to tell your husband something final when it wasn't. if he hasn't signed anything with com1 they will understand why he pulled out. that's how business works and if that burns a bridge with com1 (which i don't think it will, people here are just being alarmist) the bridge was going to eventually be burned anyway.

Let me propose a strange hypothetical. They're friends. Sorry if that was to out there.
"Your boyfriend has already cheated on you, is going to cheat on you, or both.

You deserve better.  Don't be a doormat."
"Excellent. He will know that he was a fool for treating you that way, and he will know that YOU know that you are worth too much to look back. Pack his shit, curb it, and when he calls and texts, tell him it's over because of the texts, then block and move on. If only everyone did this to cheaters. "
"Seriously, OP you don't have to keep waiting on him to make a move - whatever that move might be. If you want to talk to him, initiate conversation. If you want him to have your number, send it to him. If you want to set up another date, think of something fun you can do together and ask him out. Half the fun of dating is putting yourself out there and facing the fear of rejection. Don't let him have all the fun. "
"This might just be dirty talk for him. You wont know until you talk about it with him, though."
"You are insanely violent and have insane anger issues. You break things, you start fights over nothing, you emotionally batter him, and physically assault him. 

You shouldn't be dating anyone- ever, until you have attended serious therapy and changed you reactions and attitude. The only thing you even mention him doing is restraining you- should he just let you beat him until you have battered him enough to be content? How many of his things do you get to destroy first? 

Leave him and leave him alone. And then get serious therapy. 

You aren't passionate. You are insanely abusive. You are going to end up in jail -and it will be your fault-
 unless you get mental help. "
[removed]
No one is responsible for your insane inability to handle your anger appropriately excerpt for you. Stop trying to push some of the blame onto him. He did nothing wrong; YOU did. 
LOL I know - how many plus sized male models are there?
"Agreed. It sounds like the relationship has been unfulfilling for your boyfriend for a while:

&gt; October of 2016 and then one fine day he had this huge outburst on how I always took him for granted and that he never felt loved in the relationship 

And that you have been aware that there was a serious strain in it:

&gt; He wanted to break up and I went and lived with him for 6 weeks and when finally he saw that I was willing to be a better person and control my fucked up temper, he agreed to be with me but I felt that damage had been done. 

But it doesn't seem like you listened to him or that you were willing to admit to yourself how deep the problems ran. 

&gt; I can't meet new people. I haven't made a new friend since college. All my friends were through this guy,

That's a lot to put on one person. It's unhealthy and unsustainable. I would guess that your boyfriend has felt smothered. Most people would. 

&gt; it went from us being in our perfect little world to that world not existing anymore.

You realize that this is basically what he said, that you denied, right? 

&gt; ""You wanted to keep me in a shell, in your own little world, and I don't want to be in that shell anymore""

Don't blame this other girl for the problems in your relationship. Your boyfriend has changed because he's grown up. He's gone from being a kid to an early adult to a full-fledged adult. Meanwhile you have neglected your social life to the point that you relied completely on him, to be everyone and everything to you. I don't think your world was so ""perfect"" in your boyfriend's eyes. 


"
"I'm sorry you got played by this shady douche, it's hard to bounce back from such a foundational lie. I think that you don't owe him any kind of response, I'd just block him out and take whatever time/action you need to do to process things.

Though if you want your art back, you're probably going to have to talk to him."
"So you let yourself be pressured into having a baby when you were still a kid yourself, steadfastly refused to accept that the father didn't really want to be with you and was merely ""doing his duty"" (guys who want to be around the mother of their child don't go to school hundreds of miles away), and engage in verbal arguments and slap him, among other things.

You're an absolute mess and need to seek help. Maybe your husband hasn't handled everything in best way possible, but honestly, I feel so bad for him. He's right: your decision to keep the baby and the way he was pressured into staying with you has ruined his life. Almost no one wants to be with the person they were with in high school, because people change and develop so quickly at that age. He likely would have met someone whose personality and values lined up more with where he's at now in college or afterward."

"OP I know this sucks to hear but I'm going to be brutally honest. Your husband doesn't want to be with you and nothing you can do will make him feel that way. He's with you only because you have  child together. You can bet that the second your child is old enough that he will leave you. It might not happen until she goes to college but honestly once she is a teenager she's not going to need much looking after so it could be earlier. Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if he was cheating on you right now either.


All of this aside though you have to do something to get your life in order. There are jobs where you can work from home or volunteer groups. There are also online undergraduate programs so you can get your bachelors. You need to start doing something with your life. With you the way you are and your husband the way he is there is no way your relationship will work out. But if you start to make small changes maybe he'll comeback around as well and you can meet in the middle. 


Honestly my advice would be to divorce but I know that's easier said than done. But you can't expect things to change if you're not putting any effort on your side. You know what he wants and it's not fair that you have to be the one to change but it sounds like he's not going to be the one to go out of his way for you. Good luck!"
"Inhaling anything is bad for you.  I wasnt making it a health issue.  Its strictly a legal one.  It should be legal everywhere, if the so is paranoid for that reason, there is nothing wrong with him asking."
I'm assuming the daughter was not planned seeing as how he knew his baby mama was a POS before the end of her first trimester?  She was already pregnant when you two got together and seven months later the baby was born.  Dude doesn't waste much time there.
"But I've already seen her value of life suffer because of this. Is it really arrogance if I've already seen this happen? She's stressed, friendless, and is always on edge, and it is very evident why (although she can't see this). She even admits that her value of life has drastically descreased, she just can't open her eyes and understand why. I don't think it's arrogant to assume that these issues will not magically get better if she doesn't change."
"You are NOT a bad person. You are not an asshole. You're in an emotionally-taxing situation and you are not obligated to be his friend. 

I really do believe that you will both benefit from this friendship ending. Once it gets to the point where he is apologizing for being autistic and you are just so stressed and self-deprecating because of the guilt, it's time to move on. 

You tried. That's more than so many do. You are NOT wrong to end this friendship. "

"When talking about it to her, I wouldn't take the double standard route (although it definitely is) since it would take away from the big picture. And the big picture is that you had a life and a past before her. It is a part of you and has shaped you into who you are today. These photographs are a reminder of that, the past. And they have no impact on the present. Tell her you appreciate her sharing her feelings and you have and will continue to be honest about the pastcard girls. But the photographs, like your past, is not getting erased."
"&gt;not allowed"" never really stopped me from doing anything

I get that but my family is different. If there are hard rules like this, we follow them. My dad's family is extremely wealthy and I am even in school under a fake surname. I don't need to have photos of me up and then the next thing I know someone is making a video of how I'm the devil.

How has PE affected your life?
She has a litany of serious mental health issues. A monthly psychotic break is a BIG DEAL. That's not a small thing and it has to be incredibly hard for her to constantly cope with. She is doing the right thing in taking time to focus on herself. I'm sorry. She may be great but that doesn't mean she is in a place to have a relationship.

"My guess is that you're deep inside unhappy with yourself, and project that onto others. Everyone has flaws, yourself included. You're focusing on other people's flaws to the point of irritation, but you don't talk about your own. You probably have a perfectionist expectation of yourself, which no one can keep up so instead of being disappointed in yourself, you turn to analysing why everyone else is less than ideal. Work on being more accepting of things not being perfect, and appreciating the positives. The fact you are punishing Jane when she does have a backbone, while being irritated when she doesn't makes me think you're just at a place in your life where you're unhappy with yourself and are trying to redirect that to others. What you need is probably some expectation management, and learning to accept things more as they are, instead of comparing them to your expectations and some golden standard, and getting frustrated when they inevitably fail to match up. "
"It is common in these situations for friends and neighbors to band together in helping out with household duties, such as preparing meals, cleaning the home, dealing with any home maintenance, even babysitting, etc. Typically there's one person who takes the lead in checking in on the husband often, and coordinating a schedule for other neighbors and friends to also help out. "
"Yes I am upset and I need like ten supportive hugs over this issue because I keep hearing the same ""different standards"" excuse when guys tell women to be the ones who keep track of all this annoying crap as if that part is not an entire universe of frustrating, emotionally draining effort in and of itself. 

Everyone benefits in the long run from these chores being done, in some cases up to and including being able to sell the home much faster and for far more money than otherwise would be the case, and it's just not reasonable to put the management of that off onto one person. 

I shouldn't have to organize all the chores or dread getting even that momentarily negative ""but I'm busy! wah!"" attitude when I do bring up a chore for him to do. No one is *ever* happy to do chores, and by making your lady ask you to do them anytime they need to be done you set it up for her to receive your minor annoyance or negativity pretty much *every single day.* That is a *heavy* emotional burden over the long run. Just like how mold builds up, the upset feelings at having someone act somewhat annoyed with you for requesting their help just snowball over the years into one big lump of sadness. 

You don't even have to say anything in response to her request, your annoyance with doing chores will be all over your face each time she asks because *nobody* likes scrubbing the toilet and you're going to express that to her somehow no matter how good you try to make your attitude. There's also *never* a good time for her to ask, she will always be interrupting you as you're doing something, and she's always going to get to ""enjoy"" that feeling of being the bad guy for making you feel slightly annoyed every single day.

Chores are thankless, endless things that everyone should help manage together. They suck and no one likes them or is better suited to them. Women just get guilted into feeling more responsible for the household from a young age. Our moms rope us into the chores our brothers don't want to do thanks to an overloaded mom just not wanting to deal with the bigger struggle the boys make on getting housework done. That turns into a habit over the years and then we wind up being the ones in charge of it with our untrained partners, too.

This is an outdated holdover from the days of stay at home moms, and it is still at work in the generations following. But we aren't living in that world anymore. There's no dedicated household servant anymore, we all work now. No one should be this overloaded at home and at work.

Can you imagine how frustrating it would be if your household cars needed their oil changed every single day to continue running well but your wife decided that she just doesn't have the same standards of care for the household vehicles as you do so you can be the one to handle all that every single day? Then she gets upset that you're upset over this and starts telling you that you can always ask for her help in changing the oil in her car sometimes! Why you so mad?! 

Pretty sure you'd all go ballistic. Just start tracking the housework for yourself and do it equitably without being asked. That's all. The payoff is worth it. Arg."
"I don't think he cares either. I think he cares more about his persona and his pride than he cares about my feelings. But I will fully admit to being an emotional blowhard who takes things too seriously, which is why I posted in the first place--to get a second (third, fourth) opinion. "

Not going to lie, I think you are overreacting. Maybe it is a cultural difference but I don't really see what is wrong with her giving her number to someone? Can you explain why that upsets you so much, especially considering she never even bothered texting them back?

It affects my desire to be around you, because who wants to be around people who make you feel like you're not loved or lovable unless you change who you are?

It's fine to have an adults-only wedding, but you have to make it clear to your guests."
This is the correct answer
"Felix, this  is such a shitty comment and I hope it gets downvoted into oblivion. Not your wedding, not your rules. My fiancée and I are having a childfree wedding because kids are a liability. If they break, stain, or otherwise ruin anything, guess who's paying for it? And if they so much as slip and skin their knee, sanctimommy will scream about how ""you let my precious Kaydhyhn Mareigh get hurt how dare you!""  Believe it or not, some people don't want their special day ruined because halfway through the vows, all you can hear is ""precious little darling"" screaming at the top of its lungs. ""I'M BORED! I WANT PIZZA! IT'S TOO HOT HERE! I HAFFTA GO POTTY! I'M HUNGRY! NOW IT'S TOO COLD! I WANNA PLAY PLAYSTATION!"" while the parents fail to do any actual parenting and just let it happen because ""oh, he's so cute when he has public meltdowns.""
OP, do NOT let anyone try to guilt you into anything. It's not about anyone other than you and your fiancée. Have the kid-free wedding of your dreams. As for your dad, if he doesn't have your back, he can suck on your sack. He already had his wedding-this one is yours."
"With that mindset, don't you think it would be better for the all of you if yout husband found at least a part time job and put the kid in daycare if it's possible? Even if the kid is lying (is he usually this consistent with his made up stories?), I don't think it's healthy for the parent who resents the existence of his kid to be a full-time parent."
"I'm a girl. I'm 6' tall. I'm 99% sure I've had a guy break up with me because of the height difference (he was 5'8) and he's definitely not the only one who was less interested because of  my height.

"But he isn't taking a fun trip. He's taking a business trip. For work. Where he'll be spending a large majority of his time working. 

It's weird how resentful she is of it, and her way of showing that she's angry about it is incredibly childish. He goes on a 3 day business trip once a year. There is literally no reason she should be reacting like this and freezing him out as punishment. There is no reason he should be *afraid* to tell her that he has to go on a business trip because he knows how poorly she'll react. "
"But also decide for yourself what you are willing to put up with. My father's new wife was very similar. Very clingy and outright obnoxious. Still remember trailing around after them when they went shopping in the sales on the one day I was going to see my father all year.

"Don't mention it. Keep it to yourself. Don't cheat. Yo girl, it's normal to have weird sexual dreams about random people. It could literally mean nothing. Can't really control what you dream unless you're lucid dreaming.

"""Guy would just tell her what to do and she'd do it""

Do you have an issue with her having been submissive? Because you've repeated this phrase a lot. 

You're really obsessing about the numbers. Like it seems to really bother you that she's more sexually experienced than you thought.  

People have sex for all kinds of reasons.  Including low self esteem. I've been there. Her past has nothing to do with your relationship except that you are now letting it.

"Do you live at home? Honestly, it's way too late for your sister to go through some miracle character change and realize what she's doing *is not okay by any means*. You need to distance yourself from your sister like yesterday. This is completely not normal and she should see a professional for this (judging from your post, it does not seem like she would ever agree but her level of behavioral issues warrants professional help, not just a sit down talk with her). Your parents really did not do her any favors raising her that way and rewarding her with gifts she wouldn't feel ""left out."" 


My sister was like this, too, when we were younger (I was in my teens and she was about 4-5 years younger than me). I had a birthday sleepover and she would want to ruin it because none of the attention was on her - my parents made me give one of my gifts to satisfy her so she would stop her tantrum, it was horrible. If I got something and she didn't get her way, she would knock over my jewelry stand and mess things up on my part of the room. She would cry instantly if I couldn't (and didn't want to) bring her around with my friends, and it was embarrassing when I had to. Every time I got something, she would always ask, ""But what about me?"" If I had a nickel for every time I heard her say that, my tuition would be paid off.  

It took a long time for my parents to fix this behavioral issue, but they did. And it worked because they put a lot of effort to stop this during her growing years, so she still had a chance to understand what was wrong about her behavior. 

The point is, that your sister is past that phase, she's not being raised anymore. *She will not think she is in the wrong, no matter how much you explain with reason*. "

"One word:  Gottman

Google his 4 horsemen of the marriage apocolypse and you'll see your wife -- and I do hope you will *also* see yourself.

&gt;It typically goes like this..
-I do something the wife disagrees or is upset in some way about.
wife gets angry with me, calling me out on it. -I'll not here that my wife's tone can be quite brash/aggressive.

That's called a harsh start up, and she may also be critical rather than complaining.  Does she use ""I statement"" like ""I feel hurt and unwanted when you aren't doing your share of the chores like I thought we agreed to""?  Or is it ""You never do the chores you agreed to do?""

&gt;It can go one of two ways from here; 1- I apologise or something to that effect
&gt;2- I'm upset that she's getting so angry at me, for something that I either; don't see as wrong, think she's being unfair, or she may have already done something to annoy me that day.

Yeah so Gottman's antidote to your defensiveness is to engage in taking some responsibility for the situation.  Did you take out the trash or not?  What does she disagree on and why?  Can you show empathy even when she's using a You statement (can you point that out in a way that's not aggressive but assertive)?

&gt;With option 2, I will tend to say something back to her.. this will always escalate the argument to nuclear levels very quickly. Ending with the initial issue.

Well, yeah.  You control your reactions.  You can set the tone and expectations regarding marital communications.  "

"Don't ascribe remorse to someone who has shown none. In the context of this relationship, he cheated on OP and expects her to just get over it.

"This stood out to me, too: she isn't an exam and he took the break to study for exams. Yeah, 8 matches is a lot (given each game eats what, some 45+ minutes) but he's almost done and there isn't anything he'll learn overnight that will make or break the exam the following day. I say no foul. 

She doesn't sound like a person who can manage a relationship, and really needs to work on herself. You sound a little too charitable. You're willing to put up with too much and accept way more honestly horrific behavior from her than is healthy. She also just sounds exhausting. "
"Never talk to him again! He was so over the line! And you don't want this to turn into stalking if he thinks he has a chance. Plus, even if he isn't going to turn into a stalker, he's obviously a selfish asshole who doesn't respect you at all! He refused to listen to you a) before that night b) during that night c) afterwards when he was sober! So that means it wasn't just a drunken mistake! 

As for mutual friends- honestly, I'd tell them what happened-once- and then don't talk about it again. Just tell people you and Dustin don't get along and don't invite him to things you organize. If he happens to be at events you go to, just ignore him. "

"&gt; Give him time to cool off, but don't let him off the hook with his reaction. Have a conversation about why he got so angry with your comment.


Thanks, that's exactly what I'm going to do. I'm not looking forward to having this conversation, but I guess we better get it out of the way now. I'm definitely not going down the road of ever combining finances or buying property together if this doesn't get resolved. "
"I have a bit of a different take here, I guess. I don't think that a person who would take advantage of buying a gift for a boss to skim off a grand total of $78 from their coworkers is going to give you anything but drama if you confront her about this. I also doubt that your coworkers are going to band together against her to make it clear this is inappropriate. 

If it was a friend I'd say something different, but it's a coworker- someone you have to work with regularly who can cause a major headache for you. So for me? I'd let it go. I wouldn't say anything, because I'd think I stood to lose more by saying something than by not. But I'd also keep more of an eye on that coworker- I'd cover my ass with her by making sure to CC on emails and keep documentation ongoing in case she ever turns on you.

Basically, I'd view it as a $13 fee to give you a headsup that you need to be wary of this coworker. Considering how congenial coworker relationships can get and how irritating they can make your day to day life, $13 for a warning is a low price to pay. "
"It's possible the fact she didn't straight out tell him the results made him nervous and he was too scared to ask and didn't want to admit it. Still, what a dumb thing to say."
"I don't mean to sound harsh, but she didn't ""force"" you - you gave up. And that's absolutely understandable - parental pressure, guilt, tradition, all the rest of it, but fundamentally it was a choice that you made. The question is, **why** did you make it. Is that tradition important to you? Were you afraid of your mom's reaction if you refused? Do you feel obligated to her in some way?

Seems like this tradition is important to her, for whatever reason - either she just likes it, or wants to give the impression of one big happy family, or she likes seeing everyone together, etc. But that doesn't mean it HAS to be important to you. As you get older, have relationships, etc., you're going to be put in the position of having to choose. Doesn't always have to be one over the other! But on each occasion you're going to need to learn to decide *for yourself* what you want to do, what matters to you, what's important to other people in your life, and who among them matters the most, etc.

I've read here before that adulthood is taken, not granted. Your mom isn't going to change - she wants everyone there at these gatherings, and that's absolutely her right - she's stating her opinion and what she wants. What you need to remember though, is that **your** wants and needs matter just as much. You don't have to cave to her demands, you can decide what's most important to you and stick to your guns.

So it's probably worth having a conversation with her about it for your own peace of mind, but be prepared for her to get defensive and a bit guilt-trippy about it. In the end though, you're an adult, and you get to decide how to spend your time and who to spend it with. However, an important part of being an adult is standing up for yourself - if you don't want to do something but are feeling bullied into it, are you going to give in to the guilt trip, or are you going to stand firm and realise ""no, I'm not being unreasonable - I've made an effort to see her recently, but this time I'm going to see my boyfriend's family""? It won't be easy, but sooner or later you're going to have to come down on the side of always doing what other people tell you to do, or deciding for yourself what's right *for you*."
"&gt; There is no such thing as 'doing less because she's female' lol.

"Honestly,  id be telling her to come get her damn kids or she can pick them up ftom the police station. You call her at work, google the company if you have to. If she gets fired then she'll have time to stay home and be a parent."

"^^^ Definitely sounds like misophonia to me. It's a neurological disorder that only certain sounds trigger irrational emotions. I personally suffer from this and wear earplugs most of the time as well. Things such as clocks, people chewing / breathing, tapping, will often make me want to cry out of anger. I've heard there are types of audio therapy you can do. But I haven't personally found a cure. "
"&gt;  bully...

I'm sorry but I feel like this straight up animal abuse. I guess I have zero tolerance for people who treat animals like this. It's not really any different than chaining them outside in the yard all day. The dude you are seeing is a shitty person. And his dog is probably miserable and needs more help than a regular old training. He needs a new life. Why does he even have the dog?
"I mean...... You're basically calling her a liar, just like her husband. Why would she come her and make something up? Obviously we're only hearing one side of the story, there's no way for any of us to know what happened except to take OPs word for it. It's kinda pointless to come here and offer advice if you don't even believe what people write about their own situation. Are you saying you think she *wasn't* pushed down the stairs? "
I would have dumped you too... Hitting a kid over a game. Shame on you. 
"If he's finding excuses to not see you but those excuses are strangely absent when it comes to doing other things he wants to do, there's a problem.

That problem could simply be ""you're holding him accountable for his inaction and he feels guilty and bad about it"" or some other negative feeling he holds near you. But it's a real problem that's not going to get better unless you discuss it.

He needs to be honest with you. Completely honest with you. Not just saying 'depression' with no further elaboration. He needs to talk about the feelings he's having, specifically. Both of you need to see a therapist, whether separately or couples counseling.

At the end of the day, only you can decide what you want, but you sound like you're pretty checked out. If you do want to give saving it a try, you need to sit down and tell him what you've told us, then GET THERAPY.

Is his depression being treated? Because it needs to be if this is going to work. Therapy, meds, anything that isn't nothing. ""Depression on and off"" is like saying you have bouts of illness on and off. You don't just manage it on your own - those need to be handled by a professional, and there's usually an untreated underlying cause."

Sometimes ""I have a boyfriend"" is the WORST thing you can say, because some guys just take it like you just said ""I'd totally fuck you right here, but I can't because of my bf"", so now they won't let you alone ever because they think they just have to convince you that your boyfriend won't find out.

Special occasion = extenuating circumstance = possible exception to a rule, and there's no way to know if you don't *ask*.

"The last thing I texted her was: ""can you tell me what exactly you're talking about? I feel really confused right now but I'm not trying to manipulate you or act dumb about it. I truly don't know what's going on. I've never spoken badly about you behind your back."" And that's when she just started leaving me on read, and now it's been a whole day. 

This seems like high school shit... except even in high school, I never had problems like this. I guess I'll just have to leave it alone for now."
"The name change and not opening the texts means there's something to hide. She's either got something going on still with him or keeping it on the back burner if it doesn't work out with you. Tell her your feelings and if she keeps acting sketchy, leave. Too early on for this."
"There's no grace or dignity left. You already decided how you value her as a person, there's no turning back. You destroyed the friendship."
"It's also useful to get in writing (and talk about) because writing things down can show that different people mean different things when they use the same words, and those differences (which can cause confusion and misunderstandings) can get sussed out early on.

My partners and I are all into BDSM, and anything long-term or serious gets written down, so all parties are aware of it, aware of what they're consenting to, and generally aware of what is going on sexually with the people around them. "
Wow a whole month of honeymoon and party! 😂
"He UNDERSTANDS when you say no, he just doesn't RESPECT when you say no.

""I'm not really comfortable with this."" is a great response to anything he says that you're uncomfortable with, like him saying he misses you. Or you can change it up with ""You're making me uncomfortable."" 

If he continues to ignore normal boundaries, block him. You don't have to let someone keep being rude to you. "
"I misread this at first, and thought your girlfriend was asking her guests to restrict their behavior while visiting and keep their dog outside. To which I was going, ""Well, that's a bit strict, but I suppose she's doing them a favor...""

Then I reread and realized you two are the guests, and she wants to restrict the behavior of friends doing you two a favor, in their own home. HA HA HA no. Nope. Nope! And tell her outright that unless she has alternative housing lined up already, plus a desire to lose this friendship, she shouldn't even think of asking these things."

"I work with young kids, and we have a child who is special needs. His parents *refuse* to accept he isn't just 'at a phase' where he is violent, loud, hums, runs around, etc.

It might be okay if the kid didn't also have a weird obsession with another kid, who he just punched the other day. The mom seems to think we love her kid and has asked us if we babysit outside of the school. 

She asked me the other morning and I told her no. She keeps asking. I finally just had to be as professionally blunt as possible when she didn't take ""I don't do babysitting outside of the classroom due to personal reasons."" 

I told her, ""I am uncomfortable having sole responsibility for a child who does not listen to me."" "
That would be a great summer trip for the cousins. Are they hs or college aged?
I think the most you can do is contact her. Say something like this; I'm just going to warn you about _. It's ultimately up to you but I think you're a good person and don't want you to get hurt. _ has done _ and _. Just be careful.'
"Never assume. Even if she had them treated, she should have had a followup to ensure they are cured, which most people don't think to do because they took mess so the problem must be ""fixed"".

"Good on you for recognising your feelings and realising that you should not act on them or pursue this any further. You need to set some firm boundaries now. Stop being that close to her. Stop being her best friend. Stop confiding in her and seeking her presence to be vulnerable. Your relationship is inappropriate full stop. If she notices and complains that you are withdrawing then be upfront and tell her that your relationship is inappropriate and out of respect for J it needs to be scaled down. You don't need to admit your own feelings if you don't want to, just the need to make your friendship more appropriate and respectful to her partner and your friend. And keep reinforcing that boundary. "

"I'm an amateur songwriter and have had similar discussions with SO's in the past.

Have you asked him if these songs were about specific people? Small details embedded in lyrics tend to make better songs, and it's possible that the song isn't about a specific person at all.. He just remembered a certain feeling and was pulling from that. That's how I write, at least. None of my songs are about specific people, just feelings that I remember and may be peppered with tiny details (like soft skin) that are universal in theme.. It helps people connect with the song on a more personal level. 

Hell, I've written songs about places I've never been, just using Google as a guide. When I sang or shared the lyrics, people ask me when I took the trip. "

Some things are not suitable to discuss by text. This is one of them
"Yeah, nah. You don't need that psycho BS in your life dude. I mean, you throwing away the band was so stupid. Such a stupid thing to do. Don't do that ever again. But her reaction to it was full blown extreme psycho stuff. It'll only get worse as she gets older and doesn't learn to handle it. It could wind up with you in hospital. You don't want that."
"Get that's alpha/beta crap out of your head. If she had all the power like you say then you wouldn't be hear asking about giving your password you would of just done it already. Hold your ground show that you have equal power in your relationship and it was her that came back to you to get the relationship back.  

So since getting back together what has changed about only feeling like best friends instead of a couple? Maybe you should of just stayed friends. 
"
"What are you wanting from this? Reddit isn't likely to confirm or deny the existences of witches for you.

Relationship advice? Talk to your girlfriend. Always talk to your significant other when you have questions about them. No one else is capable of answering questions about her. Will you trust her answers? Are you theoretically okay with dating a witch? (I would sort out personal feelings on the matter before asking her). Note, if people in high school thought she was weird, you may be entering into sensitive territory. It would not be surprising if people were crappy to her on that basis. Is she otherwise religious? Maybe ask her opinion or thoughts on witchcraft or Wicca or other supernatural topics to guage her feelings.

I know you said you were aware of coincidences, but for example I had a guy break up with me because he freaked out and said he wasn't ready for a serious commitment. Literally the next four girls he dated dumped him after a month and got engaged the following month. Weird stuff happens, maybe Karma just really likes your girlfriend? "

How does he justify her straight up lying to you about him leaving you? He needs to put her in her place for that.
"She expected more people to say he was crazy and sexist and a pig, honestly. She just wanted (surprise, surprise) validation.

I know it's tough. It really is. We are so conditioned to offer excuses and back ourselves into corners trying to politely decline.

"What stopped her from telling others where the money is going? Why does she need prompting to tell them? I mean, if this is a constant thing, then I can understand them feeling a bit used.

As parents, you owe it to your child/ren to provide a safe and clean home: This doesn't just mean what's under your roof, but everything around it as well. Your husband is failing his obligations as a father for his own selfish reasons, I hate to say it but if the threat of never seeing you two ever again isn't enough to light a fire under his ass than it doesn't sound like ANYTHING will be.
 
Make preparations on your own: Buy your plane tickets, rent your van, pack your boxes, and say your goodbyes. If he cares about either of you at all, he'll follow suit.
 
If he can't or won't decide on his own, don't be afraid to make the choice FOR HIM."

"Since you know it bothers her, stop doing it when she's with you."
"It's kind of the same thing unfortunately.  You don't want to tell them to make the decision but you at the same time are upset they aren't making the decision themselves.

We've been together for almost a year, we have a great sex life. If you can't get over the idea that I might be gay, we have a big issue.""

She says that it's because she has a few female family members who got married to men who were hiding the fact that they were gay, faked the marriage life, and then ended up committing suicide because they were so unhappy. She says she doesn't want that to happen with us."
For so many reasons this is a terrible idea. Absolutely do not do this.
"This is a major betrayal of your trust. You told him no the first time he asked you about it. He disregarded your answer and continued to bring it up every 6 months which shows a lack of respect for you and your decision. Then he decided to just go on ahead and film you WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT! He figures that he always sees you naked so what's the harm - the harm is that you said no and he did it anyway. He tried to treat you like a fool and tell you that the filming was accidental. I am sorry, OP but I don't think this is the kind of man you should be marrying. "
"Honestly, this comment disgusts me. The entitlement... Just ugh. 

Firstly, on them 'choosing to support him'. This was in the condition that the kid was in full time education. When he stopped, and just started fucking around and wasting his parents money, he was effectively stealing from them. He *lied* to continue receiving the money. The money was earmarked for educational and living expenses, not to buy video games and spend on random crap whilst moping around the house. 

Secondly, I see no way that the parents have previously micromanaged the son. They let him go off to college 10 hours away with no questions asked, including about his grades. If anything, it looks like they've realised they've probably been too soft, realised that they ended up with a lying, mooching son, and have suddenly tried to overcompensate by giving him more structure. 

Lastly, your assertion that the parents should apologise to the kid after he spent 6 months doing fuck all and lying to continue receiving money from them.. Well... That's just... Everything that's wrong with the world."

Some kids: tough love is all you can do. You've exhausted everything else, so it's time. I know it's *heartbreaking*. It doesn't mean you don't love him. But do everything you can to let him be on his own and to withdraw *any* support or enabling you provide him. 

You will always be there with open arms if he wakes up and is willing to play by your rules.

And good luck with everything :)"
"All right. I'm not sure what it is you were looking for when asking for advice, since it kind of seems like there's not much we can say? You should really see a therapist for you own well-being though. You don't sound like you have a healthy relationship with yourself. 

I just hope you will find happiness. Best of luck. "

* ""People avoiding counseling is predictive of failed marriages - we really need to do this.""

Like with any red flag - you cannot ignore the red flag.  "
"&gt; But remember just because you don't see it as a big deal, someone else might. It's important to present any things that majorly affect you like that to whoever you may potentially be dating because if things progress, you become their responsibility too.

In a similar vein, the guy probably should have disclosed that he was an asshole before going out on the first date.  Horrible personality traits will doom a relationship much more than minor disabilities."

And I'm guessing if the issue was guests/roommates/children being scandalized by her naked stomach or whatever, he would have told her that in the first place.

Instead of muttering and deflecting, he should have at least told you that he planned on proposing, and maybe even given you a slightly exaggerated timeline. I think it's normal that after years you would want to talk about marriage and he should have known better than to try to blow you off, even if it was because he was planning something. 

Why not suggest a nice trip, or date night, or something to celebrate? Try to focus on the fact that he loves you so much he tried to surprise you, even though it didn't work out. He wants to marry you and spend his life with you! HOW the proposal went is going to be such a small deal, you'll look back and laugh someday. Focus on your upcoming marriage, not on how the proposal worked out."
"If you want a prenup that is done correctly, she needs her own lawyer.  Your own lawyer will tell you that also.

But a prenup isn't very useful if you aren't even engaged."
"Very true, although I would say he should make it clear the weight is a source of issue, otherwise she may insist on something like counselling over weight loss, and nothing changes."
"He knows you think he is a loser.  He won't take your help or involve you further in his life as it would give you more reason to think this.  Given this, it is unlikely he will ever put himself in a vulnerable situation with you. 

Do you guys have an extended family?  Maybe an aunt or uncle he is close too who could assist you in reaching out?"
"You need to take responsibility for allowing your son to be abused by your wife, and find a way to support him going forward. Not with wishy-washy apologies that only serve to make you feel better, but in real, tangible ways. Food and shelter, education, money, and time are good places to start. 


Who *cares* if your wife gets mad? Good god! She's a terrible human being, and you are enabling her to continue hurting your son! You have made a terrible choice in choosing your abusive spouse over your child, and *he will suffer for it for the rest of his life.* Your child has been mistreated and demeaned until he felt he had no option but to choose *homelessness*, and you are at fault as much as his mother is. Stop feeling sorry for yourself, and change your life. Fix this as much as you possibly can, and if you're very lucky he may allow you to have a place in his life someday. Although one could hardly blame him if he never wanted to see either of you ever again. "
Why are you acting like she picked this fight? Is it her fault that she likes gifts? Is it her fault for answering honestly on this test? Does this justify him mocking her results of the test for no reason at all? Stop blaming her when he's the one who sucks at something most people can do and when he decides to pick fights and insult his partner for his own faults and weaknesses. 
The worst thing about mental illness is understanding where the person's personality ends and the mental illness begins. It's tough understanding why she won't get treatment but I think you need to make this a condition of you remaining with her. You then need to protect yourself by leaving if she doesn't agree to get help.
"You're tinkering on the edge of emotional cheating. You need to drop the friend and focus on your marriage unless you want to divorce.
""Avoiding him completely isn't really an option because our classes."" is an excuse. You and your husband need to start dating again, and your husband needs a timeline to help you too. 2 years of nothing is insane, even if he has depression.

"Somebody was also murdered and shoved in a suitcase in a hotel near my house. A few towns away there was a murder in a bed and breakfast where the man was actually discovered eating the women's face. 

After that I think I would probably call the police myself if I heard loud screams whilst staying in a hotel. Worse that would really happen if it's a consensual couple is a 'breaching the peace' type charge potentially and that would be unlikely unless they were repeat offenders. Worse that would happen if it is non consensual and you don't do anything is somebody losing a life and a murderer running off."

"Nah, he's just an idiot. 

&gt; Their parenting gets undermined by other family simply trying to make the kid happy.

I wanted those to be real so badly!
"Girl, I wish my parents loved each other like yours do. Hell, I wish my parents *liked* each other. 

You're an adult now, it's a little ridiculous to be so appalled by affection. A child sees their parents kissing against the kitchen counter and thinks ""OMG EWWW GROSS YUCKY!"" An adult sees the same thing and just thinks ""damn I hope I find someone who loves me in my 40's as much as these nerds love each other."" 

You live in their house. They're feeling confident and happy and attracted to each other. Laugh it off, be happy for them, and if you're not mature enough to do that then just make your presence known every time you walk into a room - i.e. ""OOOOKAY LOVEBIRDS, YOUR KID IS COMING IN NOW"" - until you get over it."
My boyfriend and I are finally living together after two years of long distance!

"Good idea. Google Drive, Dropbox or an external hard drive would be great "
"He's hoping you'll fall for it. It's that simple.

My husband is a recovering alcoholic. One night when we had no alcohol in the house, he was acting drunk. (I couldn't figure out why).

I'd been cleaning earlier that day and unwrapped a new mouthwash. I went into his bathroom and saw it was 2/3rds empty. Cue ""that's so weird"" and ""why don't you trust me"" or whatever. 

After 5 minutes of this, I make him use a breathalyzer. Afterwards he is STILL ""wondering why"" it registers him as beyond legally drunk.

You have to bottom line this for him. ""I know you're smoking, I'm not stupid. Stop treating me like I'm stupid and tell the entire truth."" 

Most likely he has been smoking in secret for far longer than you think. I'd bet the farm that's where the guilt and over the top lies are coming from, not a mistress who shares his favorite brand."

Ohhh, well I told her I only go to the bar because of her, so she gave me her number so I could text her and find out if she's going to be there!

Wait... who else is ""involved in your relationship"" besides you and your ex?"
"your sister is feeling trapped and is rebelling, your parents just want to control her more and shape her in to who they want her to be, in turn she rebels further and the cycle continues. your sister needs space, time, and a role model that she actually looks up to. Unfortunately you cant do much about that last one without her choosing/picking out such a role model for herself. The best thing you can do is be understanding and patient with her as she goes through adolescence, perhaps she might even see you as a role model if she gains more respect for you(not necessarily that she doesn't respect you already). She wants to be treated like an independent adult while everyone around her refuses to do so, even though they might be justified in doing so. "
"This is why you don't buy a home unless you are married.  Buying a home where there is a ""your's and mine"" mentality as opposed to 'ours' is asking for trouble.  Adding in the income disparity, it would be a disaster, which you are already seeing unfolding.

"There is a contradiction between your statement of not wanting praise but also wanting better praise than you received.  

TBH I think it's likely you're creating some of this disappointment for yourself by having unstated expectations.  You're allowed to have expectations, and she's allowed to decide to meet them or not, but only if she knows about them.  

I can't actually tell from your posts whether you have communicated any of this to your fiancee or not.  You should talk to her about this because ultimately it's only your opinions that matter and your responses indicate there is already some resentment built up about this issue. If your goal is to alleviate her mental load, then you will need to ask her what you can do to achieve that goal rather than guess at what it is and be upset when that action doesn't achieve your desired results (if that's what's happening, like I said you did not mention whether this has been previously discussed). 

It sounds like you might benefit from individual and/or couples therapy as well.

edit: meant fiancee not wife"
"&gt; But I knew that early on in our relationship, and it was my choice to continue it.

This doesn't matter. You made a choice to date a guy with anger issues, yes. But that doesn't mean you're morally obligated to stay with him if his anger issues continue or escalate or he refuses to deal with them. You're making a new choice every day to stay with him and you don't have to do that. It's the same as him making a new choice every day to blow up at you. And, as I'm sure many others have said, it *is* a choice. Does he blow up at his boss? Does he break his boss' stuff at work? Does he scream at his friends over trivial things? If the answer to these questions are no, then this isn't about him being unable to control his anger, but about him willfully choosing to direct it at you."

"Listen to him when he tells you to not stress out about it. He sounds understanding of your situation and knows that you had every intent in finishing the exam, but was unable to do so due to the time error.

You have to judge if this is worth totally desroying any trust she has for you because you snooped. And yes I've snooped, and confirmed my wife met up with  another guy, that was worth admitting I snooped. Another thing to think about is do you want to confront her because your upset with her actions, or because you want to clear your own conscience?"
Did you even read the post? OP very clearly states that his wife's family will not be involved in their lives. His question is how best to support her after she's already made this decision.

He's allowed to have pasta, oats etc but wheat flour is not allowed and our pots and utensils have to be made of material that can be completely washed (so not wooden spoons etc that can trap remainders of food). He has not once complained about my need for these restrictions because he understands that I will suffer if we don't have precautions in place. For your girlfriend to not understand how important your rules are regarding certain foods in the house she either doesn't realise how serious your food allergies are or she truly believes her right to eat whatever she wants trumps your comfort/health/life."
"I'm a waitress/bartender and I have dealt with sexual harassment things multiple times. In one instance I've had to go to upper-upper management, the others I have dealt with it just through the general manager. I'm going to give you the steps of what you should do not just for now, but if you face this in the future, because you need to know your rights and protect yourself.

The first step is writing down in explicit detail the things that this man has said or done to you that make you uncomfortable. This is for your reference and also for if the issue is escalated or the boss needs evidence for dismissal/suspension of the coworker.

The boss should handle it discreetly and with as much anonymity as possible. S/he should sit you and the accused down *separately* to discuss the situation and figure out what both sides are. If there are other girls being harassed, talk to them and see if they'd complain with you so you have more allies and so you've got backup. If you know they have been harassed but don't want to get involved, you say you know other girls have been harassed and you report every instance it has happened in front of you/you have witnessed, because even being *witness* to sexual harassment counts as sexual harassment towards you.

If the boss does not handle this correctly, if you feel unsafe going to the boss, or the boss in general doesn't deal with the issue satisfactorily, the next step is going to the boss's boss (if s/he has one).

If it's a chain, you write an e-mail to HR/the boss's boss detailing names, dates, what's been done by management (if anything), 'hostile work environment', and in explicit detail every thing he has said or done to you that you can remember (ideally with dates/approximate dates). 

Make sure to mention making a report to the EEOC. What I did was act like I wasn't sure what the proper procedure was and said something like, 'Should I report this to the EEOC?' I've had to go this far only once - my boss's boss, and my boss's boss's boss were in the store the next day, reprimanding my boss and also firing the sexual harasser. Corporate places *generally* handle this very, very seriously, because nobody wants to deal with the EEOC.

If the company responds by firing you, that is called retaliation and is also illegal.

That said, sometimes a job isn't worth all the work and you just need to walk away/find another one, but if your boss has a boss I'd make a formal complaint to them so that it's at least on file.

I like what another poster said about responding loudly when he does things, 'Don't touch me like that!' or 'stop sexually harassing me' *in front of customers* - this man needs to be humiliated. 

If you don't feel safe doing any of this, that's okay too, but you should walk away from any job you don't feel safe at and you at least should know your rights as an employee. If you want to take it further if the restaurant doesn't respond properly to the sexual harassment claims, I'd make an actual report to the EEOC. But I'm petty and I don't give any fucks, I do everything I can to take down these assholes and make their stay at the restaurant as uncomfortable as possible.

Having been in the restaurant industry for 10+ years, if the boss doesn't take appropriate action I'd just walk the fuck out. Screw 2-weeks notice, they had time to deal with this problem and they didn't. You are worth more than that, you are a valuable person and a valuable human being and you *deserve* to be treated like a *human being* and not an object."
"No, but it's not okay to verbally attack your partner either. 
Having a baby doesn't give you carte blanche to act any way you want to your spouse. Pregnancy is hard. It totally fucks with your body. It makes you emotional and irrational and a hell of a lot of other things. 
But your spouse is the person who (hopefully) supported you through that. Who dealt with seeing the person they love enduring something incredibly taxing and stressful and not being able to do anything to fix it. 

You need to be a team - and neither OP or the Wife are doing that. "

"FYI Condoms offer little to no protection against skin to skin infections such as HPV and herpes, and for that matter, there is no FDA-approved HPV test for men...not mention certain strains of HPV have a high chance of causing cancer in women.

"We're all responsible for our own actions, there is no ""I did it because I was angry"" in court.  As someone with anger issues, what we feel is not always up to us, but how we control those feelings and what we choose to do with them is."
It sounds like OP did not have any questions about fertility or other birth options. Generally when someone says they made a specific choice about how they plan to have children it is because they have considered every option carefully a million times.

"That's a pretty bleak outlook on life. I personally don't find my partners who have had bad past relationships to be broken, I see them as more experienced and wiser.

And the look on the groom's face, he clearly had no idea she was going to do it and he just looked so pained and awkward.

One option seems way smarter than the other to me; who'd be more upset in that situation, the friends or the girlfriend? And while she's in the same room, sheesh. At worst, his friends would poke fun at him for a little, and if they did more than that, they aren't good friends. I acknowledge guy talk exists, but he could have more respect. "
"I agree, but (based on my own experience living with someone who has chronic pain problems) I kind of wonder if this has happened before and OP didn't follow through. "
"but you just told me your parents thought it was funny that your BF's parents suggested they pay for small things along the way, and that your parents are taking your BF's parents financial help for granted.

please have a long serious talk with your parents about how much they are willing/able to help you in case things don't work out for you living at BF's parents house."
"&gt;It simply doesn't exist.

It does exist, it's just not worth it for you to move again to get yourself in a place that has better access. Are you attending university remotely? Do you not have access to student health services? 

If you can move for a job, can't you situate yourself better for your long-term mental wellbeing? This is the type of action your situation requires.

**ETA:** Look, I get that depression and mental illness affect your mood, as well as your ability to prioritize, motivate yourself, etc... It's a feedback loop of the nastiest order. That being said, you've got to come to terms with the fact that the only way you're going to be able to address your symptoms is to be your own advocate and put your mental health before *everything*. If you throw in the towel, you run the risk of losing more than your marriage."
"I think there are a few issues here:

1. This woman sounds genuinely obnoxious.  I would not want to spend any amount of time with someone who is a self-proclaimed ""genius"" and talks about how she shouldn't have to be ""humble.""  It sounds like she needs a lot of attention and acts outrageous to get it.  I bet that's why she doesn't comment on stories you tell - sounds like she wants the spotlight on her all the time, rather than having an actual conversation with you.

2. I don't get the sense that this woman particularly likes you or wants to be your friend.  It sounds like you think the two of you should be friends, by virtue of your shared connection via your husband, but it's honestly totally valid for her to want to be friends with just him and not you.  She should be pleasant to you, but she doesn't actually need to invite you to things or talk to you much.

3. I get the sense that you don't really like this woman but feel guilty about that, since you think you two need to be friends.  It's completely, 1000000% fine for you to not like her.  You don't have to feel close to someone or enjoy their company just because your husband does.  My husband has friends who I don't like, and we both understand that and don't have an issue with it.  I don't think you should try to force yourself to like this woman, just be pleasant to her.

4. I think you and your husband haven't talked a whole lot about friend boundaries, and you probably need to.  You guys should discuss the drugs issue - if you feel weird about your husband doing drugs without you, you can say that.  If you think this woman treats you badly, you can say that.  Maybe an ideal solution here is for you to not expect this friend to invite you to things and to just accept that your husband will usually hang out with her alone and possibly take drugs - having that knowledge might make the situation feel okay for you.  Or maybe a better solution is for your husband to agree he won't take drugs with this woman alone, or whatever.  I'm not gonna judge what is or is not unreasonable, since this isn't my relationship, but I think you guys can come up with a compromise.  I do think it would be good for your husband to primarily see this woman on his own, though, since she sounds kind of insufferable and you don't seem to like her much anyway.

Tl;dr: this woman doesn't want to be friends with you.  I don't think you truly want to be friends with her.  Go ahead and give yourself permission to not be friends."
"&gt; Maybe you're the one being overly sensitive about their renewed sex life..

That's fair. My younger brother &amp; sister don't seem to care."
"This. OP, /u/yuddachi is dishing out the hard truth right now."
"I'm not sure either, but that does sound like something I want to do. Just to treat myself. It is my birthday weekend after all. "
"&gt;Some women do prefer traditional roles, and while we could argue it's sexist, the reality is some women like these roles and we didn't fight with feminism just to arrive a place where we criticize women and put them in one box yet again.

&gt;Gender roles aside, it is arguable women aren't generally as strong as men so I can see why she thought it would be unfair. 

Is this where the ""women are only strong enough to lift 70% of what a man can, so she only deserves 70% of the pay"" argument applies?"
Why shouldn't he act huffy or make a big deal out of it? Being berated for your race like this sounds pretty traumatic to me.  It's not like he tried to start a fight or anything.
"The bluntness is appreciated...it's what I know I need to do deep down.

Thanks for reading &amp; responding."
Interesting that he got worked up about it - what exactly did he have an issue with? 
"&gt;I would say something about how he was probably talking to a younger woman.

&gt;So I wasn't saying anything bad about him.

So you made them think he was cheating on you.  No wonder they hate him.

"
"I would honestly try to get  the information directly to her that she may not be safe in her building. The building may not want to/be able to take appropriate action as quickly as necessary. 

People as unbalanced as this BF can ""snap"" in response to a triggering event, and this woman and her family deserve to be warned/protected. 


The threat of people like BF is exactly the reason this family is paying to live in such an exclusive, ""secure"" building in the first place."
"I don't know the immigration law, but I'm guessing that invitation letter wasn't like a marriage contract. It must have had its limitations.

And don't feel bad about what happens to her now, she brought it on herself."
"Document it, but don't reply. Don't feed the fire."
"Dump him. He doesn't respect you. 

You will feel better knowing you're not with someone who's more interested then messaging other women than being a supportive, loving partner. "
"And setting 15 alarms go to off for 0430 in their house. Good lord, I wonder if they're posting somewhere about their houseguest. "
"THIS.

OP, I did this shit for the better part of a 12-year relationship. If he didn't like what I had to say about something, he got upset about it. It was like dealing with a spoiled toddler. That should have been reason enough for me to nuke the relationship early on, but I foolishly believed that it would work out if I phrased my complaints more delicately or better yet, kept my mouth shut.

That didn't work well, either. I avoided conflict over legitimate issues big and small. He essentially learned that he could walk all over me, disrespect me and use my fear of conflict to manipulate me. My resentment for him grew and grew until the day I decided that I couldn't take it anymore, walked out on him and didn't look back.

Cautionary tale. Don't let this situation become yours."
File for child support from both of them?
"It definitely sounds like your personalities aren't compatible. 

It's worth bearing in mind that as a woman, politics may be lot more personal for her than they are for you. It's hard not to get angry when issues directly affect your life and health. But if that's not a mindset you want to have in your life, it would probably be better for you to look for someone more laid-back."
"If you pay him you could tell him what to do. If that's not an option, you could pack lunches for the kids so he doesn't have to make them anything."
He couldn't have crashed the car if he didn't try.
"&gt; err it’s like a 5 or a 6, hope you’re having a great day sweetie :-) 

LOL yes, agree with you being an idiot. This basically means: ""You look like shit, but hope you're having a great day"" "
Also stop trying to place portions of blame on him by pointing to his low sex drive.  That doesn't excuse or rationalize infidelity. 
"Don't do this.  You'll just be her enabler.

Your family sounds dysfunctional as fuck and I wouldn't blame you for going low-contact with them.  You can rescue the cat, but you can't save your family members from themselves. "
"Then why not just move in with him, without the engagement condition?

"
If she is overwhelmed..  why didn't you know before she started talking to another dude about it? She is suss. 
"An apology is not going to fix this, as you know."
"Don't look at him. Look at *you*. Why did you stay with and marry a man who was never, ever, at any point, fully present in the relationship? Why did you have children with him? Why do you want to fix it and stay? There is nothing to fix and never was.

Not that his behavior is fine. It isn't. But you can only choose for you. Why did you choose this? Where is the error in your thinking?

I ask because I dated a few copies of this guy, before I wised up and realized that from as far back as I could remember, I was taught that I didn't matter. That I was there not *with* a friend or partner, but *for* them. I was to like what other people liked, do what they wanted me to do, change anything they disliked take care of them, ""make them happy"", have no sexual inclinations unless that's what they wanted and then do whatever they wanted. I was taught I was not a person and that my only value was what I could provide to someone else. 

I woul lose myself in relationships because there *was* no self to start with. I would do ridiculous things to ""prove"" I was good enough, and deal with any manner of shitty behavior because I had to be ""loyal"". 

But now, fuck that. I'm fine to compromise on some things, but some things are a no go. There are things I need, and if I don't get them, I'm gone. There are things I will not tolerate and will end the relationship if they happen. There are things I will not change and will not do, and if that's a problem, then they need to go find someone more compatible. Period.

And then, when the next dude like your husband came along, and 6 months in had time for everything but our relationship, and wanted me to change key parts of myself that he admired in the beginning, it was obvious to me that he did not value me or our relationship. And so there was no more relationship. He wanted to live like a single man, so I gave him what he wanted. He didn't want ME, he wanted someone, and he wanted that someone to be there when he wanted them there, otherwise they could fuck off.

That's not a relationship and neither is yours. You deserve more than to be the convenient status quo. Of COURSE he wants to keep it that way. He gets handed everything he wants, for no effort.

So why do you think that's enough for you? "
So your partner cheated on you because of peer pressure? Gross.
"&gt;Ask her dad for his blessing ...

NOOOOOOOOOOOO!  Or rather, not unless you are sure she'd be cool with it. Many women UTTERLY HATE This. (a) it seems old fashioned like she is dads property, and B) what if he says no, eh?


Otherwise pretty solid."
"You're right

&gt;All I have been hearing from these fucking people is how it was lucky I'm the one that fell and not one of the toddlers in the family."
"I thought this was a troll post but I guess not. You guys need to discuss what is ok and what's not but to MOST people this would be off limits. 

For example. Watching porn is different than making a porno. Not the same. "
"You have to make sacrifices to be in a relationships. One of those is forgoing seeking sexual attention and validation from other people. Posting nudes for other people to masturbate to IS engaging them. I don't understand your mental gymnastics to make yourself think you aren't engaging other men for sexual attention when that is exactly what you are doing. 

If you need more validation from your SO, then discuss that with him. I would consider what you are doing to be cheating in my relationship. You are literally looking for sexual validation from other people.

You need to work on your insecurities. You need to feel attractive for yourself without the input of others. You need to learn to communicate with your SO and express your needs. If you need more support, you need to tell him that instead of looking to other men to satisfy you."
"sorry but yeah you kind of do.

This loser has been mooching off his parents until now and he intends to stretch out his period of taking 0 responsibility for anything by mooching off you.

I mean if he moved here FOR YOU how much is there that you're going to need to bankroll? You need to make it clear that if he does move then it's his decision, you're not forcing him and he needs to take financial responsibility for that decision. If he doesn't think that it's worth it then you have to let the relationship go. Past this point you're basically paying him to be your boyfriend. "
"Pretty much. Sure, there are people in their 20s who are less mature than a 17 year old, but that's not really impressive for the teenager. That's just *really pathetic for the 20-something*."

"OP says that all (*all*) of his songs are about fucking women, wanting to fuck women, and wanting to chase women in order to fuck them, so maybe those *are* his truest, deepest feelings....but maybe his songs are not exactly what you might be thinking they are. "
"Every woman who has been physically abused by her husband had never had a hand laid on her before the first time it happened.

He is escalating, and it is likely you will be next. You need to create a plan and get out now."
"I can't believe I don't see this higher, but when you ask him to get therapy he says that's what baseball is for??? And what he does at baseball is get into physical fights with other players? He's showing you that for him, solving anger is hurting others, that that's acceptable to him, and it WILL soon be you. EVEN IF it wasn't, look long and hard at 
staying with someone who commits acts of physical violence towards others. 

""Other times, like when he's beating up on the sofa or something, he doesn't care if I tell him to stop or calm down. He just tells me to back off."" Soon that will be him with the glass too. Please don't delude yourself into thinking you've got some kind of magical sway. He's escalating."
"Cut Mia off permanently and after this, if you have to cut your family off to cut Mia off, do it. She'll make false accusations AGAIN. "
"Why would the legality of it influence whether or not she was shocked? They had a very clear plan in place, and he changed it in a very big way and didn't tell her for a month. How is that not enough ""evidence"" that it would be shocking to her?"
I very much agree. Peeing your parents isn't really standard anxiety behavior. Sounds like she might have been sexually assaulted. The only thing I could recommend is therapy.
"I mean, I consider being on track to becoming a doc a good career. I've dated med students in the past, and am open to dating other types of students as well. I also don't mind if the guy's future earning potential is less than mine, I'd just prefer similar general income bracket"
"Yeah, pretty sure that's cheating... they made oaths to each other. Why do people like this even bother getting married :/"
Infinity symbol?  Butterfly?  No Ragrets?
This sounds like a template for a soulless business email lol. I definitely wouldn't word it that way
I agree. We showed up happy - anticipating a relaxing day babysitting and we're suddenly thrown into a horror house to say. We were both unprepared and inexperienced. Sadly I just can't deal with the stress of James. Just back at Easter he was at his grandmother's house catapulting off the fireplace onto a pillow. I was 1000000% on edge and had to leave the room from Jane clapping and encouraging his daredevil antics.
This is definitely how it would be done with a teenager today in a lot of the US.  Maybe not a 5 year old!  But probably a teenager.
"&gt; Women care about looks, too

Yes, but if she's dating you, you probably passed her looks test."
"Then he doesn't ""deserve"" to have any of them in his life. He can die alone."
"It's having extremely poor boundaries. I don't suffer from that problem, it takes wayyyy less than an episode like this for me to be like ""Nope, you're not for me, I'm going to ignore you now.""

Something like this would require literal begging and a very heartfelt apology (plus it never, ever happening again) for me to even consider a ""second chance"" or continuation of friendship. And I'd probably still be like ""Nah I'm good,"" because he's being pretty obvious about his attempts to separate OP from her BF and/or insert himself into their relationship. Him doubling down on his exceedingly inappropriate behavior is just the frosting on the shit cake.

"Just to say also - it would be ABSOLUTELY valid, if you feel comfortable doing so, to have a quick chat with your boss, briefly explain the situation and ask if you can have the afternoon off to sort things out and make up the time some other day."

"Breathe. I realize your old job is going to be hectic without you, but that's life. You're an office manager, you're not curing cancer. They can hire a temp or order their own office supplies for a couple weeks.

Call back and ask if your drug test came back. Say you know you're clean, but you want to be 100% sure everything is squared away so you can give your employer notice. Don't beat around the bush. Besides, are you sure they were testing for MJ and not harder substances?"
"I'm going to guess there are bigger issues around statements like this:

That your wife is fed up with and this is sort of the last ""straw"". Especially since her response was ""figures"". 

You sound like a handful, and I know *I* am not a patient person and wouldn't be able to put up with it. She may be significantly more patient, but everyone has their limits."
"Can we start some sort of ""I dated a musician (and all I got was this lousy band t-shirt) survivors club""?"
"I don't think that's the only reason. Employers don't test for alcohol partly because it's a socially acceptable drug, not just because it's legal.

As someone just said, some places will test for cigarettes. Cigarettes are legal, so shouldn't your logic apply to that? You replied to them with ""let's not argue semantics"". That's not what semantics means at all. They gave a concrete example to support their thesis that legality isn't the only thing that matters. That's like the furthest thing from arguing semantics.

I'm pretty sure if weed got federally legalized tomorrow, we'd still see tons of testing. It's socially unacceptable to many employers, which is one of the reasons they test for it. Your argument that it's due to federal legality and ""no other reason"" seems pretty short sighted to me."
Sounds like this kid could use some hurt feelings to see how others feel after interacting with him...
"&gt; You heard a song that annoys you and you embarrassed your boyfriend in front of his entire family and went home. If I were him, I would not only be humiliated by your behavior, but I would be afraid of your mental state.

"Adults pay rent. Why do you insist on playing both sides if the fence?

""I pay for his housing""

""He pays for his own food""

I don't understand why you're at the point where you have got your grown college educated son barricaded in his room? 

Why are you not evaluating his mental health and finding out if he actually needs immediate care and then giving your son options such as getting treatment for his illness or paying rent and living as an adult?

What about maturity/depth of character that comes with age and experience? Do those mean nothing to you?

Good luck with the wedding and the baby making! Like someone else said, if you want to drink at your wedding you may want to hold off for a month. And as someone who got married a year ago, please delegate as many wedding planning responsibilities as you can lol. "
"Your roommates are messed up and probably jealous that he ended up in a relationship with you after they knew him as the 'fuck boy'. They basically sexually assaulted him in his sleep, while he was on drugs, after a major surgery, as a 'prank'. Not cool.

"Jesus christ I think there's a less extreme solution then ""get rid of your dog or never see grandson again"". OP please don't listen to this, don't tell your grieving mother she needs to get rid of her dog.

Obviously visits will require more planning to make sure grandma is free of dander, and certain things are now off limits (like them visiting grandma at her house). But it's still doable if they're both willing to put in that extra planning."
"OP, the possible scenario to me is the guy friend did something not great to your girlfriend, probably when drunk, and everyone else including your girlfriend has been trying to cover it up since then.  She's trying to stop you from getting into a fight with him."
"Open relationships are only ok if both couples agree to it. You obviously don't and expect monogamy out of your partner. That's completely reasonable and you shouldn't stay with your wife if she is unwilling to respect your boundaries. That's a surefire way to resentment. If you want to try and save your marriage, couples counseling is a must. But it isn't ok for your wife to unilaterally open up the relationship without your consent. "

"It's not the jealousy that is the root of the problem, it's you being a selfish person.

If you cared about her more you could control your urge to interrogate her.

"&gt; tl;dr: I need skills to be stronger mentally.

I mean, no. He needs to be less of a jerk that can't control his anger and frustration over small or nothing things and blow up at his wife like that.

We he does something like this, don't clam up . Instead, challenge him. Tell him that you don't like how he is talking to you, and that he really didn't need to blow up at you like that, and that it hurt your feelings that he did. Talk to him in general about this. Don't bottle it in and work on ""being more mentally strong"" because this isn't an issue of mental strength, it is an issue of an occasionally emotionally abusive husband.

&gt; My husband just started his first job out of grad school. It is very stressful as it involves programming he doesn't have much of the coding experience. So it contributes to his bad mood. He goes to work around 8:30am and gets back around 7:30pm (that's 11 hours). He works at home on the weekends if he has the time.

I am confused by this. He has a Master's, but has little coding experience? And he works 11 hour days, but you aren't making much money either? Something just isn't adding up here. He is either seriously getting ripped off at his current job, or not spending all of his time at work. I work in IT and the only people putting in those kind of hours are the ones making good money.

&gt; We did not have sex for one and half years (only one recently). That is fine with me. Sex is like a Hershey bar for me, it's good but I seriously don't need it. For him it's just online stuff. It's all fine and dandy with me as long as he's happy. I'm happy too. If he wants to be a happy roommate, it's not ideal, but it's great and works for me.

This really is not going to last long term. It would only be a matter of time until one of you has an affair. The only question will be, would either of you be OK with that?"
"Awesome convo, OP. I admire your patience, and I hope boyfriend stays true to his word. 

I have to admit, to me he seems less aloof/lacking in emotional intelligence and more *conflict avoidant*. Conflict avoidant types will literally ignore shoddy behavior from others because not caring about their behavior will help avoid conflict. This is a good quality to have because it helps assume best intentions. 

But it can be frustrating in times like this when there is a person around about whom one really needs to be alert. Luckily, your bf has agreed in this convo to be alert from here on out.

I am rooting on him following through. This is a good learning lesson for him and I am so happy you're sticking up for yourself. You deserve to be comfortable around his family."
"Geez, I am so sorry this happened to you. It really hurts my heart. He does not deserve you. You could stay with him but would you really be able to move past all of this and be okay? That betrayal runs deep. Especially with his plan to go and visit her in Brazil. That was low even if he did end up canceling it. The fact that he did it all makes me feel sick to my stomach. If you do decide to move forward with him then you will need some serious couple's counseling. Only you can decide if he is worth the trouble though. "
"Do you have ANY idea how hard it is to take care of elderly people.

"They did contact him regularly to keep in touch. Not just disappear and come out of the blue two months later, but I see your point and agree."
"But only this month he threw a saucepan on the floor! Do you want us to give you a way to ""win him back""? You realise that by adopting this submissive position once again, granting him the 'honour' to be oh-so benevolent and let you crawl back to him, you'll further submit yourself to his control?"
This is exactly what I bet happened. Those are really potent rumors for some reason.

""I went out in bare feet, deal with it."" 

""I'm getting the toppings I want, deal with it.""

You should go to counseling, but until/unless that happens, if she creates a big argument when you defend yourself or point out she's being ridiculous, it seems like your best option is to refuse to engage on this shit that absolutely does not matter. If she has a point on something you do that legitimately impacts her, consider apologizing. But this meaningless crap, she just needs to deal with."

"This basically describes my mom's relationship with her in-laws.  In my honest opinion, I feel like if their family does nothing but create toxicity and bullshit for you and your relationship with your SO then they're not worth your time. Also I want to make a point and say:    
    
**You don't need to prove yourself to ANYONE but yourself, especially not toxic low-minded people like them.**

"You need to draw a line. It's ultimatum and boundary setting time. If she doesn't get help and start losing weight by x date, you need to be prepared to leave her. Or accept that she isn't ever going to change. "
"It's crazy to think that not five years ago we used to take trips that involved really active things like hiking. She used to be so happy and really excited to see places in nature that she'd never seen before to take pictures and explore. Some of the best times of our marriage were spent in places like Mount Rainier and Sedona just hiking and exploring. It's hard for me to wrap my head around the fact that she's the same person that's how much she's changed and it hurts to see her like that. I want to tell her that I want us to go back to the way we were but I have a feeling she'd accuse me of only loving that version of her if that makes sense.

Maybe an intervention? "
"&gt; I just don't understand what went wrong. I

Because your brother is surrounded by an echo-chamber of the negative values he's learnt. There are countless sources of information, news, music, entertainment, and internet places for him to keep being exposed to those values. I mean, for God's sake, the American President openly sexualised his daughter, and talked about 'grabbing [a woman] by the pussy"" and experienced only mild backlash (in the grand scheme of things). While we have made great strides in promoting and generating equality and acceptance, there are more than enough places for a teenager to find likeminded anti-female people. He likes being there because they accept him and recirculate those ideas so he never breaks the feedback loop. See the youtube video by CPGrey ""this video will make you angry"". 

Your brother is also a teenager. He's desperate to fit in and desperate to be radical. Also, this is a period of time where they often will develop ultra extreme opinions (right wing, left wing, pro-war, atheist, etc) as a means of countering the values they view as old fashioned that they grew up with. He finds being misogynistic thrilling because he and friends egg each other on in this new and provocative way. He exists in the student athletic world which prizes a lot of highly negative macho traits (aggression, violence, hyper-forward sexuality, and numbers over quality of sexual relationships). All of this is toxic and it's poisoning his mindset of the world. 

Be aware that right now, your brother is on at the crossroads between 'making bad choices' and 'making permanent and irrevocable harm to himself and others'. A bad choice is 'doing something a bit bad and being a bit negative about women, and boys being boys' and it's all dealt with inhouse and no police and nothing formal and it never really goes anywhere. A lot of athletes who never experience real consequences by always getting that path end up with this attitude because they're supposedly untouchable by the college/school. College Athletes can have their flaws constantly pushed under the rug to benefit the school and it breeds a false sense of security. I feel like this is what happened now. It was wrong, but the only consequences were a sit down chat and apparently some fancy footwork on his part. He's now learned that he could get away with domestic violence. The next person he hits might not be so lucky. The next person he hits, he could do more than just slap or hit someone. On a basic, coldly logical way, he could throw away his entire career for a domestic violence felony charge, a few years in prison, and the label of 'abuser'. A bad choice might get him expelled but he could go further and end up embroiled in a case like Rehteah Parsons or the countless of others that can be found in the media. It sounds hyperbolic but I bet those parents didn't think it would happen until they got served and their sons went on trial. It starts with your brother and it ends up worse. 

I don't know that you as a family coddled him but there are more than enough hints that a) he isn't being pulled up for this enough and b) you don't say how you dealt with teh domestic violence thing. You are not in a court of law. You do not need absolute proof of something to say, ""I heard this about you. What you did harmed another person. That is not okay at all."" 


&gt; Is there anyway for me to be a good big brother and somehow guide him back to a better attitude? Or is it too late at this point?

Call him out on it. If he starts shit talking, don't tell him how awful it is or whatever in detail. He knows it. He said it for a reason: he wants a reaction from you, so don't give to him. Practise simple lines:

- That's disgusting. I don't want to hear it again. If you say something negative about women again, you can leave. 
- This is not up for debate, this is not a discussion. Change the subject.
- When you say x about women, you also say it about our mom, our sister, and [other female relatives/partners]. How hurtful and small minded. 
- We have had this conversation before. You bringing it up again makes me think less of you because it shows a lack of respect and understanding that I know you have. If you bring up this subject again, I will leave. 
- I am not talking to you about x anymore. It is not up for debate. Stop talking about it or I'll leave. 
- What you are saying is both factually wrong and disgusting. When you say things like that, I feel disappointed in you because I know you are better than that.


&gt; Should I just focus on developing a closer relationship with Gemma? Forget about Jake?

Don't forget about him, but do develop a closer relationship with her. Talk to her about what she's feeling, what he's saying. Be honest with her about how what he's doing. Get involved with her life so you can support her. Jake may turn on her if he feels you don't want to listen to him so she needs to have you in her corner.

"Yeah, I never got soda as a kid either, and I don't like the taste of it as an adult now - I don't like carbonation either, like you! I'm actually really grateful that my parents never gave me a taste for it, now that I know how bad it is for you!"
"You are just jumping through hoops to justify this. Are you the husband?

I think, like the husband, you've missed the point entirety. She told a grown man not to give her kid something, he went behind her back and did it. As a guest in her own home. Doesn't matter what ""it"" was, or WHO did it. Plenty of people cut out grandparents for the same reason. Should he be cut off permanently? That's her decision, but he's not taking responsibility or proving in any way he won't do it again.

Does it happen all the time? OF COURSE. That's why parents are allowed to set boundaries with those people who disrespect and undermine their parenting.


&gt;She invited a bunch of people over to swim in her pool and everything else. Her son was walking around mainly following her.

It wasn't for the kid to take home. The kid was already home, and they caught the kid taking it inside. The husband was being sneaky. It wasn't for the kid to drink later, because if that were the case mom would have to know about it so that she could ration it.

There's plenty people can do short of shooting meth that shows they may not be emotionally mature enough to raise kids with. 

It's not just the act, however stupid, it's his reaction to being caught."

"Don't proceed with planning a wedding or anything until it's resolved – sadly, the most likely outcome is you find out more about his hidden racism. You're obviously pretty anxious about even discussing it with him, and it's really, really important to be able to talk about the hard stuff in a lifelong relationship (like marriage). 

I'm really sorry this happened, btw. It must have been so distressing to hear him use a slur like that. "
The difference is you wanted to change and were highly motivated. OP will never change him.
"Agreed. He's blaming her for his own debt!

&gt;  he has a substantial amount of credit card debt compared to my own (think $20,000

&gt;He however believes that if I made more money our troubles would all be over

&gt;he still blames me for our lack of ability to buy a house and move forward with our shared life goals


OP, the 20k debt is HIS, and it is HIS to pay off. Not yours to pay off. The lack of ability to buy a house is not because of your salary but because of HIS credit card debts (not even including student loans)! Yet he's blaming you for HIS money troubles when he should be blaming himself. Please do what is best for you!"
"The sexual assault whilst sleeping is a really big red flag for me.  That's beyond selfish.  That's seeing your partner as an object for sexual gratification, and if he can't get it when you're conscious, he'll get his gratification when you're unconscious.  What would you have done if you hadn't woken up and the next day found yourself bleeding and sore?  Are you willing to entertain the possibility that he'll get drunk, forget his promise, and you will find out?

Super great dudes who pester and hound you to repeat a sex act that caused you pain just because they like it are not, in fact, super great dudes.  They act like super great dudes, but deep down, they believe their partners should be their sex toys, because that's how they act.  If his kink/fetish was bloodplay and you told him not to cut you, but you found him trying to cut you in the night and he was constantly begging you to let him cut you up so he could get off, would you be comfortable?  Would you be willing to believe his final, reluctant promise?  Anal sex seems pretty normal these days, and for some folks it is.  But for you, it's painful and unwanted, but that has mattered less to him than his desire for it.  Again: huge, huge, huge red flag.

It's up to you if you want to believe his promise, OP.  But if it was me?  I'd be gone.  Life is too short to be hounded by an Otherwise Great Guy who tried to rape you in your ass and kept harassing you to let him do it thereafter.  I don't think his promise is going to amount to much, and I shudder to think what could happen if he decides when drunk that you'll actually really love it if he has anal with you when you're not awake.  He's already breached your trust severely.  I don't think giving him more chances to do so in order to have his preferred sex act is wise.  Be prepared for the fact that he will likely break his promise, given his behaviour up to this point."
"Yeah, that caught my attention too. Either she actually thinks she alone is ""everyone else"", or she's so disconnected from reality that she doesn't realize that no one else gets gifts on OP's birthday ( or anyone else's birthday for that matter). Either option sounds like an issue that only extensive therapy can hope to correct."
"As far as I'm concerned, you two are perfect for each other.

They didn't advertise what they were looking for - it's not super common to include in those tiny bios - and they were all completely on board during initial conversations where I would tell them I'm only looking for a FWB. They just change their minds without letting me know these things until I notice the dynamic shifting and bring it up. "

You're not receptive to others input and you acknowledge others wouldn't stay in your situation. 

So what's the question? What are you looking for from this community? "
"&gt; Maybe she didn't know he was already laying down (she was in another room). Maybe her hormones have gone crazy and she gets hot flashes at inopportune times. Maybe she was sweating onto the baby she was changing.

Maybe she bosses OP around over every little thing and we should take his frustration at face value. It seems like she asks OP to do trivial things because she likes being in charge and bossing him around, and it seems like you're projecting your own experiences and prejudices onto this situation. I don't think this is a mental load or emotional labor problem.

Oh, and I didn't realize we could blame women's actions on their hormones. I thought that was frowned upon, although I see it used around here to excuse bad behavior more than I'd like. "

"I think your GF should read up on ED. Her clapping hands and asking you if you ""are ready"" is not a very compassionate thing to do with a man who suffers from ED. It puts a lot of pressure on you to perform on command, which is very counter-productive. 

The idea that you should be erect all day because she hangs around nude all day (from one of your comments/replies) conveys a total lack of understanding on her part. She must educate herself.

You say she hates oral sex because she knows she want be getting PIV sex 50% of the time. IMO, your GF lacks sexual maturity and sensitivity to your needs.

Edit: If she can't educate herself and understand what ED is and how to make love to you as a whole man and not just a penis, you may need to reconsider her prospect as a long-term partner."

This convinces me even more that they're going to fire the caregiver and demand you give up your job to do this full time without pay because FAMILY! They're trying to exploit you while saving the money for their eventual inheritance. You need to refuse and perhaps even go to counseling with your husband about this situation and his relationship with his mother. You might have to go low or no contact with them.

You even acknowledge that there are red flags there. I appreciate not expressing those nice things in your original post, but if, at this moment, you still can't say exactly what you *do* love about him and that you don't know what you're doing, that *may* be a red flag in itself."

The outside agency do have access to barristers who advocate for the mentally ill (I donate to the charity that supports them!)

I do work in a heavily union represented area, but as I have said previously I have followed each and every internal procedure and have been told by a senior union representative the only concern would be if other team members complained as I have gone above and beyond what is required. My concern has been how to deal with an outside agency whose sole reason is to advocate for the mentally ill. 

Your advice on how to ask for incidences of bullying has been helpful, for that I thank you, it has really been helpful."

"From a person that once used to be like your gf, and this may not be the case, but I don't think she's fully invested in the relationship. When I was nonchalant with a guy, still cared but had other more important things going on, I used to just blow them off. It wasn't ""intentional"", it was just that I had other things I needed to take care of that seemed more urgent in the moment. And, it created some sort of energy where the guy would seek even more of time since I didn't have all my time to give. Reading from the lines, it seems that you're pretty well off or at least willing to spend a lot of money. Combined with her lack of you being a priority, I would take a step back, call and ask less of her time, and that will give you the answer you're looking for. "

"I agree.  I don't need validation but you need to understand how much time and effort he puts into facebook.  It's not just a passing thing -- he uses it as a way to interact with ""virtual friends"" nearly daily.  All these people whom I've never met feel really close to him and think they know him.  And it pisses me off that I'm behind the scenes, being with him, giving him love and companionship, planning things for us to do, providing emotional support, giving him suggestions and opinions etc.  And he STILL seeks the advice and adoration from all these virtual friends, all the while completely neglecting to mention me in any way.





As an example, recently his grandfather passed away.  I provided a lot of emotional support, I helped fine-tune the eulogy, I ordered the flowers and I drove with him to the funeral in a different city.  He talked a lot on FB about how his grandfather's death was affecting him and of course all these people reach out to him saying he doesn't have to go through this alone, that they are here to listen, etc.  







He doesn't say anything one way or the other (simply ""likes"" their comments) but it makes me feel invisible.  He's NOT alone!  I'm here every step of the way and the last thing he needs is ""Sandra from highschool"" to take him out for a coffee to figuratively hold his hand through this.  (not that he takes her up on this offer....but the fact these people feel free to offer comfort not realizing he has a finacee just irritates me).  Not sure if I'm making sense but the way I feel is a mix of sadness, invisibility and some strange jealousy."

I don't think Ben is merely too immature to be a father, I think he is a bad partner and has been for a long time.

She was already doing all the baby care anyway. Now she just has one less mouth to feed.

"You want to marry him AND you want him to change. The thing is you can't really have both. He has to at least be willing to have real discussions about how he speaks to you and how you communicate with eachother. Have you ever told him you are questioning the relationship based on how he treats you? Meaning has he ever been aware it's that serious?

Listen, only you know what you're going to do, and I'm willing to bet you do indeed already know. If you're going to marry this guy, then what is the next best thing you can do? What if you tell him tonight that you're willing to go through it but he HAS to promise to go to counseling immediately? You're not going to get him to see, understand, or empathize with your feelings or point of view, so there is little point explaining yourself over and over. Just tell him you aren't happy, you were considering not going through with it, and that you need counseling.

If he gets angry and doubles down, perhaps saying HE doesn't want to get married, let him. He just gave you your answer. 

Do not be afraid. You haven't done anything wrong. Please remember that all the things you visualize for yourself and all the things you want are all things that you deserve.

"Yeah, I mean that whole relationship sounds like it had been pretty unhealthy. It sounds like you need to figure out how to meet people in person to date to avoid seeking validation virtually. "
You really need to take control. This is addictive behavior. Treat this break up like an addition. If you dont take responsibility for your emotions you will suffer for it in future relationships. This is not the end of the world. You will empower yourself. You will love again. You are capable of greatness and self love. Focus on your counseling and cutting all ties. It gets easier over time. Self harm is just another addiction. Its not a solution. I recommend looking into DBT therapy. It teaches self control and mindfulness.  Good luck.

"Don't JADE (justify, argue, defend, or explain)-- she will find a way to go around you. Just have to say no. You're not comfortable with it and that should be enough."
You folks need to start talking about sex. Right now.

"I mean, I get it though.  Whether you say you didn't go to pride or whether you say you were spending time with your friends, that's lying, and lying feels bad.  And lying to hid your sexuality from your inlaws feels even worse.

But it's the same thing, from the other direction, asking him to basically come out to his parents for her is a super awkward thing to do for limited benefit to anybody.

Approaching this with sympathy, where maybe she doesn't have to lie, and he doesn't have to literally say the words to tell them, is a good middle ground."
I am concerned that she's hiding an STD behind the curtain of vaginosis.

"Its honestly amazing that she's able to blow that much money, I'm 19 and went away for university i get $250 CAD for food and transit and I make it work easily. "
"It really sounds like you're not compatible at all... and if he gets jealous and you don't, then don't cheat on him behind his back because you have different value systems. He doesn't deserve that."
"Two days isn't enough time for a child to transition into another household.

Kid might want her mommy, but it isn't about what the child wants - it's about what is best for the child, which is as close to equal time with each parent as possible."
"When my friends rent beach houses anyone who doesn't get to stay in a real bed in a bedroom doesn't pay.  Since all the bedrooms are taken and paid for we treat folks sleeping on couches/air mattresses as friend crashing on the couch visiting us for the weekend, essentially.  They have to deal with the bummer situation of not being able to go to bed until everyone else has and having to wake up as soon as someone else does.

That's what we see as fair since we're adults and not having a bedroom is pretty awful, but every friend group is different."
"There are a lot of kids at that age who don't understand the difference between seeing the violence on screen and parents telling them not to do it. I have nieces and nephews who have watched similarly violent shows at that age and some will listen to the parents about not copying the TV show and understand that violence is bad, and others don't listen and just want to do it because the good guys do it, so proceed to punch and kick people around them. 

Just because you understood no to be violent after watching the show doesn't mean other 4 year olds will be the same. They have suggested viewing ages for a reason. "
"Seriously.  A 30yo with a good salary should be able to pay a dental bill or be able to put it on a credit card.  He should also be mature enough to prioritize his health and finances over some ""gadget.""  Does he seriously have no savings?  "
"I'm actually pretty proud of myself for realizing my mistake in storming out and apologizing, but the top comment right now is calling me out for handling conflict poorly, so I felt the need to explain myself a little bit. "
"I mean, in these situations isnt it less about the age itself and the difference in priorities, maturity, expectations etc? She doesnt seem like she is some naive college kid, so just give it a shot. I wouldn't think too much about it though. "
"Yeah, the fact that they're *engaged* and he's never even mentioned her in passing blows my mind. I've been dating my bf for five months and he and I aren't connected on fb because we work together, and it honestly bothers me a little bit. I couldn't imagine this going on for years. Is he not going to post pics of their wedding?!"
"I ultimately have to agree with this. There really is no compromising on such things. After reading what OP wrote, it sounds like she needs to think of her own self-preservation. One does not owe their SO a baby for any reason, let alone at the cost of their own health and well-being. If he can't handle that, it raises questions of how much he truly loves and values her over something that isn't even a person."
"She was tired and wanted to go home, so you decide to dive underneath her skirt, then grab her breast? What made you think that was a good idea, that she would appreciate that? Or didn't you care what she thought?"
"Agree with this one. If it makes you feel any better cross your toes, legs, or fingers while saying sorry. it's not as sincere. 

He got what he asked for, however you could have left him more injured with than the cat. You should really be careful about where you punch people. "
"Whose life is improved by telling her? It doesn't improve the roommate's life. It doesn't seem to improve the date's life. It only improves your life because you think it will make you feel better, potentially at the expense of considerably inconveniencing both of the other women involved. You only went on one date. You don't owe her an explanation for not going out with her again."
"&gt;I know I can't just tell her ""Don't get it cause I don't like them"" 

that's true

&gt;and she also cant just be like ""I'm getting it cause I like it.""

that's not.

she actually CAN do that b/c of the whole 'it's her body' thing.

i'm like you. i hate tattoos. really hate the way they look on anyone and i don't care what the tattoo is. it just completely turns me off. so i'm not coming at this from some 'pro-tattoo' sense. but she does get to get one if she wants, and you get to not be attracted to her once she gets it.

sounds like you've made it pretty clear that this is going to be a huge problem for you. the ball's in her court now.

"
"Right, literally one of the first things a kid sees in his/her life is a breast, and the adults know she has some anyway. If her shirt isn't transparent, then she's decent for going around the front yard."

9pm is not that early for a teacher who has to get to work at 7am
"Right here you are undermining her ability to think for herself. You are undermining her emotional intelligence. You are asking strangers about what is best for her rather than trusting her own judgement.

Knock it off. Its rude as hell."
"Don't date someone who tells you how to dress. Simple as that. This is a control tactic, nothing else. If the neighbors had been offended, they wouldn't have waved.

I live across the street from an elementary school and I regularly take the trash out in my night gown/bandeau and sleep shorts/oversized hoodie/bathing suit. Its my property, my bits are under fabric, I'll do what the fuck I please."

"You are 32 years old. Time put your big girl pants on, think clearly and act like an adult. "
"He's only admitting to as much as he thinks is forgivable so that you don't leave right away. He may trickle truth you further down the line when he thinks the immediate danger has passed. 

I seriously doubt that he's telling you the truth, but even that is all there is to it, it would not be an overreaction to leave him."
"Even if it was because your kids accused you of abuse? No abusers are going to admit they do it, a nanny cam would at least mean she didn't immediately take the kid's word as proof -otherwise she'd get out straight away herself."
"&gt;So you're like me in which logic means more to you than emotions do when it comes to decision making. 

That's bull, there's nothing logical about obsessing over his girlfriend's sexual past."
Ok. Just making sure. I think that what other people have said about nanny cams and therapy are your best bet for now. 
They are shitty to all their kids.
"No. Just no.
She is an adult and if she lets her parents run her life to this degree?
I would run away, far away because it isn't going to be a one-time occurence."
"Well, I can't do it today since today is the birthday party. I want to, but whenever I do bring stuff up, I'm still the one in trouble."
You mentioned that you think your dad &amp; his girlfriend got together while he was still with your mom. It's possible the girlfriend is really overprotective of him going out places because she knows what he was like when she was the other woman. Just food for thought. But yeah definitely tell your dad you just want alone time 
"I think he has a job, because in the OP it says ""he wanted to change jobs and move instead as he hates the place hes at now"". But he just won't change jobs to move to her. "
She has been using you and your family and is not treating you with respect and love.  Break up with her.  You deserve better.
"It cost $100, so both $50. We didn't buy it new but it's still in the condition we bought it in. Like I said I have no clue what I'm expecting because I haven't dealt with this before. "
"That's the great thing about an EX husband. Not your circus, not your monkeys. Recommend that he go to therapy ONLY if he comes to you for help or advice. Otherwise, let him go do his thing. He's 10 years older than you, there should be nothing that he needs in terms of life experience. He's been an adult 3 times longer than you."
You don't love him enough. You both deserve better.
"Well, you need to make it clear that he needs to pay more attention to  what you're saying. Tell him that you are pissed and why are you pissed. Ask him to never do this shit again, especially when you're around potentially dangerous objects.

While it's possible he's being macho or stuff, it's also possible someone pulled the old good ""No, I can do this myself""....""Why aren't you helping me?"" shit on him and now he's trying to help even harder when someone tells him they got it because he thinks it means he's gonna get in trouble for not helping, if that makes sense. If for example his parents did this when he was a kid, it may be a tough habit to break.

Anyway, he's a danger to himself and his surroundings and needs to get over this pattern. If you don't explain it to him again, there's chance he'll keep doing it."
"Your husband cheated, so you cheated, then you went to live with the guy who has no problem getting involved with a married woman, and now you're wondering why he won't ""commit""?  OP....come on.  Just break up with him, divorce your husband, and get some intensive therapy.  Your moral compass is broken."

"You need to stop worrying about getting inside her head and figuring her shit out, and you just need to manage your own.

You've clearly stated you want a relationship. She's turned you down and it seems like even now, you are not 'in a relationship' in any way regardless of what else she has said she feels. She doesn't have 'a relationship' on offer to you.

What she is offering you, is impacting your mental health negatively.

You need to end whatever this is, for your own sake.

You're calling this complicated and delicate because that feels better than admitting what it truly is: Not what you want. No signs of becoming what you want. "

"Doesn't matter whether you understand. The end result is that she cares. If you care about her, accept that she cares. Don't try to make her justify her likes and dislikes, that's horrible."
"You so realize that the more you use this reasoning, the more she will doubt a future with you? If this is your view on weddings and marriage then what's the the point of her doing it with you. I'm just curious, you've never gone to watcb a movie with her that  she wanted to see and you didn't?"
"I don't consider it a miscommunication. He and his fiance (whom I lived with for several months when I moved to the same city) both had told me at different times I was in the wedding party. She has two sisters who are BOTH Maids of Honor. I'm his only full sibling and the only one he grew up with and he completely forgot about me. He forgot what he had said to me on more than one occasion and then he forgot about me when he had to write out his wedding party. I'm his brother, not some military guy he's known a handful of years."

"I doubt it.. Katy is ridicilously beautiful and will often turn heads when walks in to a room. She says after seeing the pictures, it feels more real to her and she really doesn't like it so I don't know what I can do."
"This is a super unhealthy expectation/hope to have for him. He should tell her that he's developed feelings and thinks they should get some distance between them because she's happy in her relationship now, he shouldn't be trying to homewreck with this revelation."

Traditionally jokes involve humour. 
"He tried to make you jealous/insecure/ prepared for a short relationship by being decisive about your future together (because ""all girls"" are supposed to want to be married young and thus must plan ahead) and he was baffled when it didn't throw you off and broke you into tears. 

That's also why people here will advice you to break this off (girls are supposed to only choose partners they can have babies with) and find a guy that you get more attached to so you can plan your whole life through these next five years - while on the other hand its pretty normal for guys to get a comfortable girlfriend they can just have some short term fun with long into their forties. 

Just enjoy this and don't think too much about the future right now. I know plenty of girls over thirty who's not married and is enjoying life without any rush.

"Yeah....this whole story sort of reads like some weird fetish description or writing exercise, especially with the very specific descriptions of their looks and bringing other people in the hotel into their sex life...yeah, such a difference in looks/size is normal, get over it, why people apparently can't stop commenting on a non-issue?

He is an FWB for a reason there is no commitment to a relationship. If it makes you uncomfortable maybe this lifestyle isn't for you.

"It would be sort of unfair, but he gets to unilaterally make decisions about your life, it's time for you to make one yourself.


OR, you could just pack his bags and leave them outside the door.  Your basically a single parent anyway, and he seems to not care at all about your feelings, your needs, or the kids.  Let him pay child support."
"### List of Red Flags in this post

1. A heated argument and she told me she was packing and staying with her parent's for a couple days.
2. She threatens to leave pretty much every time we have a fight. 
3. She doesn't mean temporarily.
4. Her: YOU'RE MEETING UP WITH A FUCKING GIRL!!!!
5. Starts throwing everything on her nightstand at me.
6. The zong hits the dog.
7. Glass hits me in the shin.
8. She storms past me, pushing me into the wall.
9. She proceeds to slam the bathroom door repeatedly.
10. Shattering on the tile floor and it cut both of my feet and I had a couple cuts on my right arm/hand.
11. She has completely refused to take accountability for it.
12. She has jealousy issues and it has caused other problems in our relationship. 
13. She wants to meet any member of the opposite sex before I hang out.
14. She seems very reluctant to [get help].

Any one of these are justifiable grounds for breaking up with someone. Several of them are justifiable grounds for filing a police report, getting a restraining order, or pressing charges. The fact that she's like this after **a little over a year** and that she's **32 years old** means that this is completely beyond saving. You need to take a good hard look at yourself and what you want out of life. What would you do if a friend came and told you that their partner did any one of the 14 things listed above?"
"Amen. I bet she doesn't scream at her boss like that, or her teachers, or the crazy looking guy on the bus. She abuses people she can get away with abusing. "
This is an unhealthy mindset. You need to see a counselor to work through your own issues. 
"Nothing you've said has anything to do with her and everything to do with you. 

"" I have no judgement of promiscuity, although I think it can sometimes indicate a deeper problem with a person"" 

Well, that's definitely a judgement, so. 

"" I have a feeling she's always on the lookout for her next new ""fix""""

Like as in a new activity? Or a new person to be with? 

""Very friendly with men, has a lot of male friends, always hates on women even though she has female friends as well"" 

That's unfortunately a product of society; we're taught to be competitive with other women. 

I have no idea what the actual problem is here. I agree with the other comment on the post; get some therapy for yourself.

"Drop the ex from your life altogether.  He's going from insecure issue-boy to passive-aggressive guilt-tripping creeper.  As long as you keep in contact wit him, he's going to continue to inch into your life, trying to get into the friend-zone in the hopes that someday you'll ""come around"" and sweep him off his feet.  The fact that you are already viewing this as a power struggle is a HUGE red flag.

Those are the actions of a boy.  You deserve a man.  Don't play his games.  Hell, it sounds almost like he gets off on this sort of drama."
"I'd say it's both sex and affection, but isn't sex really just another form of affection??

I totally recognize the difficulty of med school.  And trust me I happily sacrifice pretty much anything in order to help, support, assist, or get out of the way, whenever needed.  

I also see her classmates and spouses managing their relationships and families, able to display their affection for one another while still going to med school.   I'm not asking for her to drop everything she is doing and pay attention to me, I'm just saying be emotionally present when we are together.  Show excitement to see me when she comes home.  Hang out with me while we are out with friends. Be even the slightest bit flirtatious towards me in any environment or atleast be receptive when I try. 

These aren't high effort or time consuming actions.  They are simple little things that go a long long way."
"She asked why you married your wife because she thinks your wife is ""unfriendly"". Your mother is not sweet."
