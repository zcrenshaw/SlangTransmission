0,"We've been together just under 16 years, and have been living together for 13 of those years. I'm an insomniac with a chronic migraine problem. He's a hard sleeper who has a weird thing where he doesn't sweat like normal. We are very compatible in life... We've never even had a fight. We're just not compatible sleepers, and that's okay. 

We shared a room for a good six years before we decided that enough was enough, we just aren't meant to share a bed. We both find ourselves less irritable and much better rested since deciding we needed our own rooms. It also gives us our own private space to do whatever in.

Some people think that this is sad. I think that those people would sing a different tune if they were able to enjoy a night's rest without being bothered by snoring, blanket wars, or flopping. We have very little control over the kinds of sleepers we are, and instead of letting it build up resentment, we decided to sleep separately. Our relationship hasn't changed except for now we're both getting plenty of rest.

Sleeping separately doesn't mean a relationship is bad. It can mean two rational adults who really care for each other took the proper steps to make sure the other was getting plenty of rest. I love him more than anything. Even tacos. Why wouldn't I want him to get the best sleep he can? He feels the same. "
1,"If you're going to stay behind me please just keep your distance. I'm probably going to start walking faster whatever you do. 

If you come speeding up behind me because you're about to pass I'm going to find it initially alarming and then be glad that you're in front of me once you've passed.

If you crossed the street I would find that reassuring but recognise it's not your responsibility to do that. "
2,"Due to his work hours my partner often naps when I'm awake next to him in the afternoon. 

Whenever I sneeze he mumbles a little Bless You, and if he turns over and accidentally touches me he makes a little ooh sound, like he's just discovered something pleasant. 
"
3,"Yes, because I won't need them once I'm dead, the least I could do is give them to someone in need. "
4,"He sleep cuddles me. He is totally unaware that he does it. If I get up in the middle of the night (say to go to the bathroom), he'll instantly turn over and spoon me, holding me super tight. Any movement I make in bed triggers him to do this. When I talked to him about it, he said he's not aware of doing it (which I believe) but he just loves cuddling so isn't surprised."
5,"My ex. He grew up middle class but was convinced that he had had a 'poor' childhood because his parents weren't able to indulge his every whim - seriously, he thought that because he didn't get every single thing he'd asked for as a kid that he was poor. 

Because of this, he believed that the universe 'owed' him. He didn't try in school, or work, and then would get angry when he did badly because it wasn't 'fair.' He would get angry at his friends who got better jobs than him (because they were better qualified and better at their jobs) and demand that they quit so that he could have them because he deserved them more. He got angry at *me* for any awards or scholarships I received for my hard work because it wasn't 'fair,' despite us being in completely different programs at different schools and therefore not even competition for each other. 

He had a work placement as a part of his program, spent the majority of the time playing video games on his phone and ended up costing the company 10,000$ because he okayed an incredibly defective product without actually checking it because he wanted to get back to his game. He couldn't understand how this was his fault, was absolutely devastated when his boss yelled at him and tried to ensure he didn't get a credit for it, and was even more upset when they wouldn't give him a positive reference letter. 

My dad has a nice sports car. He bought it as a young adult in pretty bad condition, fixed it up and now it counts as 'classic' or whatever. My ex believed that *he* was going to inherit that car when *my* dad died. Not me. Not my brother. Him. I don't think he and my dad ever even had a conversation.

Seriously, I could go on for ages, I have 1000 more examples. But he constantly went on and on about how the world 'owed' him things and how nothing ever went his way and how 'unfair' everything was because he perceived his childhood as less-than-perfect. "
6,"No one really cares but I am very small up there. 

Some guys do think it's ""hot"", and a couple people have asked me why I went bra less but it never has been a big deal. 

You should wear  a bra tho for job interviews. I had an employer look straight at my nipples once.  "
7,"Every time he gets me something in a bottle of some sort, like Gatorade, water, beer, or something else he cracks open the lid so I don't have to struggle with it. "
8,Sending unwanted dick picks and complimenting women by insulting other women.
9,"Donate to organizations like Planned Parenthood, PFLAG and the ACLU, organize a toiletry drive for a local women's shelter (I suspect they'll see a lot more demand). Look around you, I'm sure there's plenty of organizations that could use a willing pair of hands right in your own community.

 My city's sister march was snowed out today, but I joined  my union's regional women's council, and  I'm busy organizing a food drive instead of shovelling my way out today. "
10,"If I give him the option between which days we can meet up, he'll *always* pick the one that's soonest."
11,"I've noticed people going braless in public before. But how awkward would it be to go up to them and say ""HI I SEE THAT YOU'RE NOT WEARING A BRA"". Also, I just don't care that much about it either way. "
12,"they complain about women having it so easy and being able to get a guy no matter how ugly they are.

meanwhile i've read rejections threads (rejecting women you're not attracted to) and while the vast majority of guys were overwhelmingly sympathetic because they know how it feels, i was kind of awe-struck by the sheer number who *also* admitted that they feel at least on some minor level pissed off, bitter, or mopey that the only women who pay them any attention are ugly, not the ones they actually want. only a few said they'd be flattered without adding in this caveat.

with women it's just a quietly accepted truth that we will deal with being approached by men old enough to be our grandpas and everyone in between, it's not something to even complain about."
13,"As a young teenager I went to a concert and put glow-in-the-dark nail polish in my eyelashes because I thought it would be cool. Not so much, had to cut them off after I couldn't get it out and the remover couldn't be used on eyes, So I had NO eyelashes for ages."
14,"If ever have to go away for the night/weekend my SO sends me pictures of him and our cat on the sofa together, captioned something like ""Our boy is enjoying some man-time with his dad""





It makes me melt every time."
15,"The only person who has ever noticed is my SO and since he is the suavest man on the planet he blurts out ""Are you wearing a bra? Because I can see your nipples""


Literally no one else has ever said anything about it.  If they noticed they have kept it to themselves."
16,"That red wine colour that's everywhere right now? I absolutely love it. I want it everywhere. Clothes, throw pillows, lipsticks. "
17,*If I wanted the government in my womb I'd fuck a senator*
18,"That I was a drug addict and alcoholic for many years. But I understand in a way, because I'm the same when I meet other ex-alcoholics. We swap stories and I just can't believe the healthy, smiling person in front of me used to pass out in their own vomit every night. 

Also that I'm a lesbian. They can believe that I'm into women, but a lot of people seem really confused that I'm not into men. I get comments like, ""But you could have any guy you want!"" Like I'm going to go, ""Oh shit really? Well then maybe there's hope for me! I hereby renounce my lesbianism!"" "
19,"dealing with the strange stares from people when my husband would for example come in with me uninvited to doctor appointments, meetings with social workers etc because i ''needed a translator''. 

in my home country (former USSR) it's normal for the husband to handle the business, so i was very grateful when someone in a position of authority would pull me aside or even chastise him in front of me, saying that not letting women handle their own affairs wasn't normal here. he had told me it was normal, and it was just one of the lies (including that i'd be deported if i left him).

like someone else posted, i constantly have nightmares that i'm back there, too!"
20,"My husband I eloped with our best friends at a castle. We already had a kid, a house, the whole 9, and didn't want to shell out for a huge wedding (his side is basically My Big Fat Greek Wedding so his guest list would start at 120, just ""immediate family""). And we wanted were some nice pics, you know? His side was annoyed...""why didn't you do it at the church?"" ""What about having a reception?"" Can't you get remarried at Fancy Country Club?""...and we'd say back, ""Sure Aunt Bertha! Thanks for offering to pay!""  They shut them up fast lol. But after a few weeks it all calmed down and no one cares about it. Except my MiL, but she's a monster. "
21,"We have a three-month old who wakes up a lot. Normally we sleep in our bedroom with the crib next to us. But if one of us really needs to a break (especially my wife because she had such a rough pregnancy and has to breastfeed too, so she deserves all the rest she can get), then she will sleep in the guest room. 

Then if he cries, I can see if he settles down without feeding. Sometimes my wife can get 5 or 6 hours sleep like that. But if he's hungry, I unfortunately have to wake her up. I wish I could breastfeed for her. (There is a way you can induce lactation for the non-carrying mom, but it often needs hormones and we didn't want to fiddle around with those.)

Also, when she was pregnant and throwing up 40 times a day, she sometimes forced me to sleep in the guest room if it was really bad at night. I kept saying I wanted to help, but she wisely said it would help her more if I was actually rested and could take care of everything else during the day. "
22,He will always cut off a piece of whatever he is eating and put it on my plate so i can try it (when we eat out). 
23,"Not a movie, but the show ""Black Mirror."" Most episodes, but especially ""White Christmas"" made me say that multiple times."
24,"I'd prefer passing, or ideally crossing the street.

The other night there was a group of 20ish drunk guys walking uncomfortably close behind me as I walked home from work, so I crossed the street. They immediately crossed too! DON'T DO THIS.
"
25,Keep trying to pursue you even though you've expressed that you aren't interested.
26,Sorry I have no experience I just wanted to comment on how absolutely adorable this post is.
27,"I like the general trend that it's acceptable for adults nowadays to dress young. Like I'll regularly see people in their 40s in Converse and fun tees and baseball caps. But if you look at photos of people in say the 80s, everyone looked so much older, know what I mean? Like a 28 year-old back then actually looked like a grown-up who could own a house and have a family! But now a lot of us look indistinguishable from teenagers.  

It also has to do with the fact that nowadays a lot of adults are still living the lives of younger people. Both because we're screwed financially, and because we have more freedom to do creative or unconventional careers. 

Anyway, I'm just glad no one bats an eyelid at the fact that I dress like a 12 year-old boy. In fact I somehow get complimented on it. "
28,"I really love it when SO and I are in separate rooms and I overhear him saying ""I love you"" to the dogs. "
29,"I'm a vegetarian for the simple reason that I don't like meat. The taste and texture has always grossed me out, so I don't eat it. People always expect me to be a PETA warrior and I'm like ""lol no"". Although if I don't make as big of an environmental dent and save some animals, that's nice too."
30,Yes.  My sister was and she ended up saving 4 people.
31,"My cousin's family; they're a perfect example of ""champagne tastes on a beer budget"".

For example: My uncle offered to buy my aunt (his sister) a basic car model. She said, ""I don't want this car, I want a [bigger, more expensive model]."" They had a back and forth about it (he wanted to know why she needed a bigger car since she would be the only one using it), but ended up giving her the money. She bought the cheaper car and pocketed the difference.

She (and her children) have also depended on my uncle to fund their leisure travels/trips in the past, to the point where when we dropped by their city, they called him up and said ""Why don't you give Bill and his family some spending money?"" (Bill is my dad). And over Christmas, my aunt kept telling me ""Oh, you know if you need money on your trip to see your LDR boyfriend, you can just ask your uncle"". Like thanks? But I already saved up the money months in advance.... "
32,"My husband does that. He claims to hate snuggling while he's asleep because it's too hot, but then when he's actually asleep he will grab me with both hands and pull me to him. Occasionally he will take the bear i sleep with and throw it off the bed in a fit of sleep-jealousy."
33,"Empathy, imo. Lots of times you can learn to grow in other parts of your personality if you're just willing to be empathetic and put yourself in someone else's shoes for a bit."
34,"I eloped in my best friends back yard back in 2013.  I still hear people complain about not being invited, and the fact that I didn't have a reception.  My grandma is the worst.  ""I'm your only living grandmother and you didn't even invite me to your wedding, blah blah"".  


Honestly I don't care.  I spent $20 on shoes, and $15 on a marriage license.  The end.  I could never justify spending a lot of money on a party. But I like attending other people's."
35,"Anything can be breakfast!

I grew up with a very western idea of breakfast -- cereal, toast, eggs, bacon/sausage, pancakes, etc. All the standard western stuff. The very idea of something not in that lineup was crazy and weird to me.

I've been dating a Chinese guy for a few years. To him, anything edible can be breakfast, and Chinese cuisine is famous for eating some breakfast stuff that I would have never considered morning food. 

But now I'm a complete convert! I'll eat dumplings, dim sum, wontons in congee, pork buns, beef satay over noodles, ham and egg noodle soup, and a bunch of other stuff for breakfast that I would've balked at a couple of years ago.

Now my friends think *I'm* the weird one..."
36,"This sort of thing happened to me last week!

Occasionally, I make bath bombs. Lately, I've gotten lazy and instead just dump in some epsom salt/coconut oil  and a few drops of essential oil into the tub. A deconstructed bath bomb, essentially (ha!).

I was really sore and tired, so I figured I'd do peppermint and eucalyptus. This was a past successful bath bomb combination. It provides a very light, soothing cooling sensation. 

While the water is running, I add in a few drops of both oils. The last brand I had used a little dropper tool, while these ones had one built into the cap. Instead of carefully measuring it out, I was just dumping the oil in. 

The tub smelled *really* minty. Way more than it had when I used the bath bombs. I was a little annoyed, but figured that since I was showering off afterwards anyway, I wouldn't be too fragrant that night. 

Anyway, I'm sitting in the tub, relaxing, when I notice that the water is really...hot. But only in some areas. My hips and elbows are starting to burn. I pick my hand up out of the water and drop it back in. It doesn't burn. Maybe my hand is suddenly less sensitive to hot water, I think. Maybe it got used to it while I was swishing the oil in earlier. 

I ponder this for about another minute, when the burning gets worse. Now my legs are burning, and my upper arms. I jump out of the tub and the burning is even worse. Fuck, I think. It's the essential oils! I pull the tub plug and turn the shower on. The water is coming out cold because I used the hot water for the tub, and soap and water is just making it worse. I start googling for remedies, and see coconut oil. I grab globs of oil and smear them all over me. My skin might be burning, but hot damn it is soft. 

I end up practically slithering around my bathroom like a minty slug, slathering more oil on until the burning finally stopped. My skin looked a little red in some places, probably from me smacking coconut oil onto it, but the burning was gone. The minty smell stuck around for a few days."
37,"That everyone should by default want and have children.

Children are much happier and healthier when they are truly wanted. If not - don't push anyone into being a parent."
38,"Basically everything by Linkin Park. ""Bring Me to Life"" and ""Going Under"" by Evanescence. Not really ""angsty"", but I also loved ""I Write Sins Not Tragedies"" by Panic! At the Disco."
39,"Always waiting for a woman to get ready to go somewhere. I've never known women to have worse time management skills than men. Some women sure, but I've known my share of men who are always making people wait.

I swear to God, I'll have gotten dressed, and done my hair and makeup all while wrangling a toddler who I also got dressed and packed 17 snacks for, and my husband will meander out of the shower and have no idea where he left his jacket."
40,"Wearing black and brown together. Fuck you, I'm fabulous!"
41,"Emotional Labor. 

I don't want to be the one who has to keep track of everyone's birthday and food preferences and plan events and make sure everyone talks things out instead of bottling it up until they explode.... but somehow it's the womenfolk who end up doing this shit. "
42,"My bathroom has no space to put a hot straightning iron so I left it on the floor. Stepped on it. Jumped back, screamed a bit and spent five minutes running cold water over my foot in the sink. Took foot down, stepped in the straightning iron again."
43,"I'm not even engaged yet, but my parents have flat out bribed me to elope. They are NOT into the idea of the fuss of a traditional wedding"
44,"well, i was in love with the idea of who he was, but ultimately it was a ''green card marriage''. i had hoped we could be together for real, but it did turn out to be too good to be true (european men who seek foreign brides don't tend to be the best of the bunch). he resented me the moment he realized i was a traumatized girl who wouldn't reward him ''saving'' me with eternal giggles and sunshine and in fact had problems from my upbringing. though he had promised he would let me go without resentment if we didn't work out because he cared most of all about me having the opportunity to be a free woman, he went back on it and began the control and abuse.

i'm long gone!"
45,"Wearing oversized sweaters despite having a larger-than-average rack. I don't care if I look like a pregnant potato from the side, I'm comfortable as hell. "
46,"If everyone is in absurd, sexy armor then it's just funny. If it's only the women, then it's annoying."

50,"""im horny, send a pic"" - Stranger

So. Because *your* penis - which I couldn't give fewer fucks about - is feeling some type a way, you expect me to drop everything, including my morals, to rush to the bathroom to take a picture to cater to *your* needs, since obviously I don't have anything better to do and pleasing people is the cornerstone of my existence?

There's probably better examples of entitlement out there, but it hurts my brain every time I see those messages on /r/creepypms."
51,"Him: I don't like that

Me: This?  
Him: No, that feel's weird.

Him: No. I don't know what you're doing wrong.  
Me: any idea how I can try to do it right?

Me: Can I watch you jack off so I can learn what you enjoy?  
Him: No, I want to have sex.

Him: That feels weird.


THE FUCK DO YOU WANT!!!!!!????


When we finally gave up, I convinced him to jack himself off onto me, then;

Him: Can I finger you at least so you cum too?  
Me: No, sorry, I have some allodynia going on, I can't orgasm today.  
Him: But I want to make you feel good.  
Me: You could rub my shoulders, or play with my hair, or just trace your fingers on my skin, or snuggle.  
Him: Nah, it's ok.  "
52,"Not so much with what they say that happens but *why* they think it happens. 

""I can't read minds"" and complaining about a woman not telling the guy what is bothering her or what she wants: By my experience it's almost always because she already said that before and nothing changed, or the guy discouraged her to talk either by talking like expressing a negative feeling = nagging or by overreacting.

Women only want to date rich guys and/or guys that would fit in People's Sexiest Men Alive list: Look around in the streets, you will see men from all kinds of looks and financial status with a partner. Mind I'll say, usually the guys who complain like this are the guys who would *only* date a woman who looks like she would fit in Esquire's Sexiest Women Alive list."
53,Girls just wanna have fundamental rights
54,"Driving like they're on a race course to impress you. I don't think that's cool, I fear for my safety. "
55,"I resent the fuck out of the fact that if my house isn't clean it's *my* fault, even though I live with 2 grown-ass dudes who are just as capable of cleaning up. ""Conventional female practice"" would decree that I suck it up and do all the cleaning anyway. I'm not gunna."

Sure she did, bud."
57,"Unfortunately, there are some people out there. Just a few days ago I was actually wearing a giant sweater of all things and a lady in a parking lot practically yelled to her boyfriend ""That girl NEEDS to be wearing a bra.

63,"I'm married to a man. Most people that I meet assume that I'm gay, and since I wear a simple band and call him my partner, assume that he is a woman. He's not. I'm bisexual and present pretty butch. "
64,"That I am disabled.

I have an ""invisible illness"" and can usually hide this fact.
And when I can't - I usually stay home.

The onset of the disorder really hit hard in the last few years - so I have been quietly backing out of certain social things I used to do (example: playing league kickball or going to events where it is uncertain if I can be accommodated - having a seat, staying a comfortable temperature).

You have to go through a mourning phase to accept the fact that the life you ""desired"" will not be the life you lead. Once you accept this fact you can start to ""come out"" as being disabled.

Not everyone knows about it because it isn't something I parade. But sometimes I do have to advocate for myself and ask for help or assistance, or maybe explain why I cannot do X, or someone sees that I have a handicap parking placard - and this usually leads to me telling that person about my new reality as a disabled person.

I don't look it and you'd never guess unless you happened upon me during a flare up.

For the curious - I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome

She was 20 and had been dating him (my uncle) for a few months.  They've been married almost 50 years now.  I'm not sure they really love each other anymore, but are just used to each other.

Pair with a nice top for business casual, pair with a T-shirt for more actual casual, and they can double as pjs in a pinch.

74,"One night I was walking home from the gym (about a 1km walk) on a well lit street that I've never had an issue with and a guy was walking quite close behind me with his hoodie pulled up over his face behind me so I crossed the road.......and so did he, so after a few metres, I crossed back.....and so did he....and again I went to cross back  and could feel him right behind me and some great advice I'd read somewhere popped into my head ""If you're feeling threatened, act crazy, noone wants to deal with crazy', so I turned around and screamed right in his face LOL he absolutely SHIT himself and sprinted off in the other direction! 

I have no idea what he was doing or what his intentions were but I just felt like he was toying with me and trying to make me feel uncomfortable. "

76,"My ex roommate was the most entitled / selfish person I have ever met in my life. She had a small yorkie, and did not take care of the poor thing. I was the one that fed the dog most of the time, and she didn't take it outside so you can safely assume what the dog did in response. But she just didn't care, seemed like it was more of a thing to take selfies with than actually care about. She did not pay for her own rent, her parents did. She racked up $10,000 on her mom's credit card by shopping basically every day and taking ubers everywhere. 

She started seeing guys on tinder every night, even one's she didn't like just to be taken out to dinner for free. Then with tinder she met a professional athlete who shall remain nameless, but was super into coke (which is a lot of them), so she got into it. And from then on my life was this girl having parties every single night, leaving messes everywhere and giving our key out to random dudes. She also didn't pay the bills, so I either had to pay the entire thing or our heat/ elec/ internet would go out. 

When I confronted her about anything, she was super passive aggressive and basically stated that because I didn't go out partying or live the lifestyle she did that made me unpopular and just upset that my life wasn't like that. When she was yelling at 4:30am and I politely asked her to stop, she would yell at me from her room and start talking about me with her club friends. Basically, she didn't really care about anyone but herself, her appearance and her lifestyle. "

78,"I once stepped in for a friend who doesn't want kids who was getting flack from a male coworker telling her that he *didn't believe* that she didn't want kids. All I said was ""would you believe her if she were a man?"" and he just stopped dead and you could see the realization sweep across his face.

I mean, I personally do want kids, but that's *my* choice and it should be nobody's business but mine and my partner's. Being childfree is also an absolutely valid choice but somehow women who make that choice are not extended the same courtesy as I and other women who want kids are."

Now, there are hundreds of *cheap* bralettes that are cute and comfy. I really dig the more natural look that's popular now with bras. I guess I'm also lucky in that my breasts are medium sized and bralettes are perfectly comfortable for me. I love them so much, I kind of want to stock up in case the trend passes."

But me... man, I can't be bothered to *shave my legs* regularly. Like I'd touch up my roots if I dyed my greys. So I'm just letting them come in. And wrinkles. why are wrinkles such a bad thing? especially if they're smile-wrinkles. :) when I smile and the crows feet come in around my eyes, I kind of like how they look. They look like the eyes of a woman who is kind as well as wise and I try to be both.   

I think its BS that a man can go grey and he's ""stately"" or ""distinguished"" whereas I'm just getting old. Ugh and the whole Dad Bod thing. My refusal to participate in all the anti-aging would be I guess 2/3rds laziness and 1/3rd feminism. Mostly I just know myself and I know I can't be bothered to adopt a complicated routine to correct something that doesn't really bother me."

95,"Our wedding was only semi-nontraditional, and I expect by 2016 standards it was pretty traditional (it seems like nontraditional really has gained a lot of traction in just the past few years!). We had an outdoor wedding at a historic home in our area that is rented for events. We had a friend marry us in a secular ceremony. It was short, and we had friends and family read (pre-written by them and approved by us) advice to us as part of it, and we recited both semi-traditional vows and vows that we wrote ourselves. I walked down the aisle to The Smiths' ""Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want"" and we exited to The Darkness' ""I Believe in a Thing Called Love."" We also used Ray Charles' ""Ain't That Love"" and Queen's ""Don't Stop Me Now.""

We had a cocktail hour but had our photos done before the ceremony and instead used that time to have a few minutes to ourselves and then do some mingling so we had more time for dancing later. We had a dessert table with many small cakes and pies instead of a big wedding cake. We had food stations with tacos, burgers, and BBQ instead of a ""traditional"" meal.

I was expecting some major pushback from older family members but got surprisingly little! Only my grandmother, once she found out about the food stations, kept commenting that she hoped that she would be able to find something to eat (for MONTHS before the wedding). She wouldn't let that go. I assume she found enough to eat as I never heard any complaints from her after the wedding. I was expecting some comments about the ceremony and having a friend marry us, but we got none. And I received a surprising amount of compliments after the wedding that it was the most personal and fun wedding people had been to, which I really took a lot of pride in because that's what I was going for! Our ""theme"" was ""shit we like"" so I was a bit worried about how it would come across, but people really seemed to love it. Do you, that's what people will respond to, apparently!

Edit: spelling"
96,"We were already in love when we got married, but the decision to marry was actually for financial reasons. We were both college students and planning on living together. The town where our college is has super high rent. We could not apply to low income housing as students unless we had one of a few exceptions. One of them is being married, so we got married and then applied to this apartment complex. (The other ones were like being on disability, having a kid, or being a veteran.)

We would have been living together anyway, but our rent is about half what it would be if we had to live in normal apartments.

I never thought I would get married before living with someone. It's been about a year and a half and so far it's great :)

If it wasn't for the financial situation we would have lived together as boyfriend and girlfriend."
97,"I had an abortion.  While it was happening and immediately afterward, I realized this was a child.  Not the nameless, formless blob I had convinced myself to think about, but an actual child.  I was far enough along that my abortion was actually induced so that I would give birth to a stillborn, and lying there with that dead baby was like a knife to my heart.

But to be absolutely clear--I would never again get another abortion for these reasons, but that is *my* choice for *myself*.  I don't have the right to make that choice for other women.  So I am personally pro-life, but I am politically pro-choice.  I would never judge another woman for making her own choice with respect to her body."

101,"I really hate this situation. I'm angry about the fact that Trump is the President Elect. Given all the news about his terrible cabinet picks as well as his lack of qualifications, fuck. Not only is he not qualified, but he's unprofessional and doesn't seem to understand diplomacy. He's a fucking bad person and with all the weirdness towards Russia? Goddamn. I do not respect this president because I do not feel like he respects me. I don't think he respects anyone really. He's a completely different breed of President that we've never experienced. How are Trump supporters not alarmed? I honestly feel like we have a different set of values. 

I know people are saying we need to come together and unite, but I can't. I'm mad. I am losing sympathy for those who voted for this man. If he ends up fucking us over, I doubt I'll care about the people who chose him to run this country. He had red flags flying everywhere (and continues to) and people still have the gall to talk about how corrupt Hillary was in comparison. 

Fuck. That's how I feel. 

On a positive, I am becoming as politically active as I was in undergrad. I was on the Elizabeth Warren campaign in 2012 and feel a lot of pride about what she's doing right now. "
102,"OP asked for serious so you're gonna get serious. I went to a GP because I had a lump that came and went on the side of my breast. I must not have timed my consultation well because when he examined me he found nothing there. He went through the usual ""don't worry, you'll be fine, chances are very slim, you're too young, etc"" but he did give me a referral for an ultrasound if I felt I wanted to follow up. He implied it would be a waste of time and as I know they throw referrals around like confetti just to cover their arses, I went home feeling relieved that I was going to be OK. Life went on and so I forgot about it for a while. Around 8 months later I noticed that although I didn't have a lump, the side of my breast had gone concave. I went to another doctor and as soon as I took off my bra the expression on her face told me all I needed to know. She was straight with me, although she couldn't say anything for certain she told me that it wasn't a good sign, and sent me for an ultrasound. This time I went. I got the ultrasound, they immediately biopsied whatever it was they found there and then gave me a mammogram. A not very long story short I had my initial results, was referred to a surgeon and within a week was in surgery. Two days later I had my diagnosis. My cancer was advanced (metastasized to spine and liver) and my prognosis was 25% chance of living beyond 5 years.

I do not blame that first doctor. Doctors probably deal daily with people banging on about ridiculous complaints and in reality the chances of something being wrong is quite small. But on this occasion I was that small percentage and if his attitude was less dismissive it might well have meant the difference between catching my cancer in time, and my current reality."
103,"To me, cheating is a betrayal of trust and demonstrates a lack of respect for the partner and overall relationship. That's why it is a total deal-breaker for me. As to whether or not it is the worst thing one can do in a relationship, that's up to how the people involved feel. To me, it would be an irrevocable end to a relationship, but not the literally worst thing they could do to me. There are a lot of things that are total deal-breakers to me. None of them have to be ""the worst""; they are just unacceptable. "

* somehow still managed so end up spread-eagle (while burrito'd!), at best crowding me and at worst (twice) literally pushing me out of a king-sized bed. His half, it seems, is from the middle.

I, on the other hand:

* am a light sleeper who is easily woken by noises, even if wearing earplugs (which I do);

* can't sleep without some covers on me; and

* don't respond well to being kicked at or pushed out of bed.

* Oh, also I don't easily get back to sleep after being awakened.

I don't think I can deal with the physical changes of pregnancy. To me it doesn't feel magical. I don't want my whole shit to change. I'm really private and get skin creepy-crawlies when someone touches my stomach. I don't think pregnancy would work for me. 

But I love kids. And I'd love to adopt. It's expensive and difficult though my company covers adoption costs. "

I told him I didn't want to. Some hours went by and he said he was going to do it anyway, 'to see how I felt after'. 

Screw that guy, not in the good way either. That was so disrespectful. I cut contact after that.    "

I'm finding it hard to explain but, the implied negative view of women is a deal breaker on its own, but it also is a huge red flag for any relationship, because I'll constantly have to play a role and live up to that expectation. It's similar to a guy who hates all his exes, you have to realize you'll be next in line for that hate. "
124,"I usually get paid a differential of 8%-10% because I am bilingual.

130,"&gt;What issues do men complain about that just seem like a load of baloney to you guys?

When the topic is sexual consent and laws about it, I often see guys complain about how laws about clear consent would be bad for them. They worry about having consensual sex with women, and then being accused of rape because the woman changed her mind *afterwards*. Or the woman cheated on her boyfriend and felt bad about cheating so she said she was raped.

Like accusing someone of rape is a standard everyday thing for most women."
131,"I didn't know I was different until I eavesdropped on my mom talking to an aunt about a possible autism diagnosis when I was 13. I was always quirky, but it didn't seem out of the ordinary for me. That conversation was a life changer and I started seeing I was much behind my peers (emotionally and socially) and how different I was.

Even now at 21, my mom and psychologists and psychiatrists say I'm emotionally 14. I feel much behind my peers while at the same time being a step forward since I've been on my own since I was 18 while everybody else still lives at home. I'm getting married to a man with Asperger's and a low emotional intelligence (but very high intelligence in general) too. It might seem like a train wreck - but believe me, it's not.

I was only diagnosed with Asperger's at 20 when I raised the issue to my psychologist because I was tired of feeling weird."
132,"There's a board I'm on which is primarily men, with one other woman.  The guys ragged on the other woman for taking photos when we would meet and how she was on her phone all the time.

She is out of state for two months because her daughter had a baby.  Suddenly everyone is asking where the minutes are (she unofficially kept notes as we went on her phone and would email them), missing meetings because no one texted them to remind them, complaining that they don't have progress photos to refer to, etc.  But then they joke about how she isn't there, on her damn phone.

When I point out that her being on the phone brought the following values, they look confused."
133,"That we shouldn't show emotion or it makes us weak. And that affects everyone, including women. The only difference is that women are assumed to be weak already, so on the surface it looks like we get away with it - but actually it's one of the main reasons women aren't taken seriously in public spheres. 

We have to suppress emotion to be even on the same playing field as men. And even if we manage that, people still point to our ""periods"" or inability to think ""rationally"" to try and prove that it's impossible for us to ever overcome our emotional weakness. 

And of course for men it means that showing emotion or seeking help for mental health is out of the question, and is a huge contributor to the massive male homicide and suicide problem. (Which isn't talked about enough IMO. A few terrorists happen to be Muslim, and people rally to ban all Muslims. Meanwhile *almost all mass shooters are male* - but no one says shit about men.) "

135,"Guys who act like paying child support is worse than being pregnant, having a child, or being the primary custodian of said child. They also act like it's unreasonable to expect them to prioritize their own birth control, up to and including postponing sex until they know somebody better. 
 
Pretty much that entire argument smacks of, ""I should get to have sex whenever I want, and never deal with any negative consequences."" No. That is irresponsible as hell, and you are an idiot for expecting it. Putting 100% of the responsibility on women for pregnancy is not the answer, and you're an idiot for acting like that's a reasonable thing to ask. Either prepare for the possible outcomes of **your choices** or don't fuck. "

I feel bad about the wrinkle between my eyebrows that signals I'm definitely not 24 anymore. I seriously consider Botox sometimes. But goddamn that shit costs money.

151,"He had a lot of expectations of me, and what I was supposed to do in a relationship. Like, I should put a lot of effort and thought into birthday/Christmas/anniversary/Valentine's Day presents every year because he deserved gifts but I should be grateful that he saved me a beer from a six pack as my birthday present. 

There was also this expectation that I should be willing to have sex/perform sexual favours at any time. He used to randomly send me dick pics and expect me to send nudes in return. And when I say randomly, I mean like I would say 'Hey sorry I'm just at my brother's graduation right now, I won't be able to reply for a bit.' and then he'd send a dick pic and demand that I 'sneak away' to take nudes for him because it wasn't 'fair' that I had gotten nudes and he hadn't. 

There was also this constant battle about my interests. I am not a gamer. I like some video games, but they weren't the *right* video games, and this frustrated him to no end. He whined constantly about how I wasn't a 'cool girlfriend' and how we didn't have any of the same interests. But what he really meant was: I didn't share *all* of *his* interests. I tried! I really did, but it was 'unfair' that I didn't want to spend 18 straight hours playing Halo 4 with him because that's what a 'cool girlfriend' would do. 

He wanted my parents to pay for everything. This requires some backstory: My parents aren't rich or anything, but they had a different mentality when it came to spending than his family. His family would take 10-12 small trips a year, whereas my family would take one big trip. His family made medium-sized purchases throughout the year, while my parents would save up for one big thing. But he was so convinced that his family was poor, he couldn't see that their spending was probably roughly equivalent to my parents' so he decided that my parents were like, millionaires or something because they made these big purchases. My parents had a pretty strict rule about money with me which was 'if we're not there, we're not paying for it.' Which he knew about, and yet he still tried to get them to pay for everything.

He wanted us to go spend a weekend away? I should ask my parents to cover our room, board and travel. We're going out for our anniversary? I should ask my dad for some cash. He'd ask me to ask for money for gas, for his hobbies, for me to buy him more expensive presents. He'd say things like 'Tell your parents to take us out to dinner,' all the time. Eventually he decided he 'hated' my parents because they wouldn't bankroll him. 

The worst though, the *worst* was when we were in university he complained incessantly about how broke he was and how the only grocery store near him was super expensive. So for Christmas, my mom bought him a $100 gift card for his local grocery store (it was also applicable at all the different chain stores too) and she did this two years in a row. And BOTH years his response (only to me, thank god) was: 'Wow $100 that'll only last me two weeks.' Like he had expected more or something?? 

Man, this has gotten long so I'll wrap up cos I could keep going, haha."

165,"My point exactly! When it's just women in skimpy clothing, that means it is clearly targeted for men and women are ignored. If both men and women have skimpy type outfits available I feel more included. I honestly don't care if a woman has her boobies and ass hanging out in a game. But if that's the case, give me a hot skimpy guy to stare at too! Men aren't the only partakers in fantasy! Women like it too! I want a hot elf with no shirt!

And YES there are gay men and women but I hope you see my point. I'm generalizing here!"

We had a second ceremony in his country for his grandparents and the rest of the family. His aunt and uncle eloped and they still haven't heard the end of it.

If we're eating out and I try to give him more than 1-2 bites of my food, he turns it down until I'm done eating because he wants to make sure I have enough food.

When he makes his last snack of the evening he always offers to make me one too, makes me try a bite of his, tries to give me half of it. On the rare occasion I do crave a late-night sandwich, he gets all ""HELL YEAH!"" and rushes to the kitchen to make each of us a crazy caloriffic grilled sandwich.

Then we're laying there and he says, ""Wow, you came like 7 times.""

188,"When I was in middle school I had really bad abdominal pain. It was awful. I spent three days crying, vomiting, and being miserable, with some periods of time where I felt marginally better. My mom thought I was being overdramatic about minor period cramps and didn't do anything. She made me go to school. It wasn't until I threw up at school that she finally decided maybe *possibly* it could be something and grudgingly took me to the hospital guilt tripping me the entire way because it was cutting into a planned camping trip. It turned out to be ovarian torsion. My mom still blames me for missing some of the camping trip because she thinks that I didn't drink enough water and that caused it because she looked it up online while I was in the hospital and found somewhere that said that. The doctor told her that that was very very unlikely, but she's convinced that the doctor was wrong and it was my fault.

I'm still super bitter about it because my mom can't admit she did anything wrong in not taking me to the hospital sooner like I repeatedly begged. But a few years later my sister had some bad pain which she took her to the hospital for that day. It turned out to be cramps which of course just makes my mom feel validated. "

Luckily my neighbour (an off duty policeman) called it in and my ex was arrested.

203,"When I was in high school my mother started feeling tired all the time. Like she would get winded walking to her car. We went to a family bbq and she ended up with a couple mosquito bites.... all which swelled up massively and became purple/bruised. She thought that was really weird and got some blood work done. Her white blood cells were crazy high, her red blood cells were super low, and she barely had any platelets. Her doctor wrote it off as a viral infection and sent her away. 
She felt really dissatisfied with this answer and by chance had a dentist appointment the next day. She showed her dentist the paperwork and the dentist told her to forget the appointment and told my mom she needed to get herself to a doctor because there was a very high chance she had leukemia and she could start hemorrhaging with the way her platelet count looked. 
Within the next few hours my mom went to a local hospital, got the diagnosis, and was rushed to UPenn to start emergency chemo. They told her if she had waited any longer it probably would've been too late. 
A couple rounds of chemo/radiation and a bone marrow transplant later and she's now 5 year cancer free/past the rejection threshold."

I have one sibling. Easy. He has four, two of which have a partner and children. So... It'd be weird to invite just the sibling and not their family.

Ok... And if brother-in-law and teenage niece is coming, won't grandma and grandpa feel slighted? Yep, better invite them too. His grandparents live in the same house as his uncle and it'd be weird if they were like ""ok bye, we're going to that family wedding that you weren't invited to,"" so I guess we gotta invite him too.

And if one uncle is invited, all the other uncles and aunts will feel slighted if they aren't invited, so I guess we gotta add them AND their partners and children.

Suddenly our ""small"" event is like a hundred people. 

The point is you gotta draw the line somewhere. And no matter where you draw it, *someone* is going to feel slighted and excluded. If I want to draw the line at ten guests? Then sorry, grandma. "

I have a neuromuscular disorder and he used to be horribly cruel to me when I was sick.  Once he said, ""taking care of you makes me want to kill myself.""

Another time I broke out on my cheek and picked the zits which left red marks.  He was FURIOUS.  He said, ""Every time I look at you for the rest of my life I'm going to be disgusted.  I'll never be attracted to you again.""

What an awful person."

219,"My entire life my family told me that my periods were normal for women in our family. That everyone had really heavy periods and sometimes they lasted for a longer than normal. 

When I was 30 I had routine blood work done and they called me and told me to rush to the nearest ER and tell them that my hemoglobin was at a 3.1. 

I did and I was immediately admitted to receive iron and blood transfusions. I was so anemic that my brain wasn't getting enough oxygen. From the time that I had my blood drawn to when they rechecked it in the ER it had dropped to 2.7, which apparently is close to passing out. 

During questioning by the Doctor I mentioned that I had been on my period for 2 months. Tire screech. Freeze frame. They all looked at me in shock. Turns out that you're NOT supposed to bleed like that. And it's NOT normal.

He'll say it in the most genuine, excitable way. Like I read his mind or something. It makes me feel really appreciated and happy. 

For his Christmas present, I got him this Game of Thrones wax seal kit. It comes with miniature envelopes and paper. It's adorable. A couple days after giving it to him, I open the mailbox to a wax sealed letter. Inside, it's a goofy love letter from Ser Bae. I thought it was the lamest, cutest thing.   

He's not great a secret gifts, so when he sees or hears about something he thinks I'll like, he mentions it immediately. ""So, hm, would tickets to **some band** be a good gift for your birthday?"" or ""hypothetically, that'd be a pretty good additional gift, right?"" He got me tickets to a band I like that's playing at an amusement park (god, he hates amusement parks) for my birthday. I loved the band growing up and always said how it's on my bucket list of bands to see live. I really love the gift because not only is it a band he does not like, but he also despises amusement parks. I think it's so thoughtful that he got the tickets despite all of that.

I've just realised my brother is more entitled than my friend....who wants to hear about him?! :p

- Complains non-stop that our parents phone me more than him but when my parents do call him he doesn't answer the phone or respond to the missed calls/voicemails they leave. When they finally catch him on the phone he is rude and speaks in a dismissive monotone until they feel uncomfortable and politely say their goodbyes. If they ask him how best to contact him (because he never picks up...), he says they should 'keep trying on the offchance they get him at a good time'. Those are his words. I'm not even exaggerating. My mother forgives this because ""poor him, he's busy"". He is *extremely* busy, he works constantly, but so am I, and I just end up fielding the calls that are supposed to go to him and play middle man whenever my parents need to know some info (like whether he will be there for Xmas, for example). This gives him more ammunition to say they call me more than him. Yes. Because I am actually reliable and polite. It doesn't take a moment to return a missed call or text message. I have explained this. He does not agree that his behaviour has any impact on my parents' likelihood of calling him. If they ""really loved him"" they would chase him....*vomits*....

- Complains, still, in his 30s, that he was happy until I was born and moans our parents loved me more. Still feels owed 'love' he thinks I got (I got more attention, admittedly, I wouldn't say I got more love). Because of this, he feels I also 'owe' him (because it's my fault I was born or something?) so he'll be critical, cold, controlling then when I pull him up on it he will say that that's just the way our relationship is and I have to suck it up and deal with it. Or, he'll tell me he has to behave that way because I'm too ""weak"" and ""boring"" and it's horrible for him to have to be around me. If I was better he wouldn't be upset, and then he wouldn't have to behave that way.

243,"Twenty years ago, I was 27. 

Not a ton of difference, honestly.   It's a matter of degrees.   Less slut-shaming,  more openness and acceptance of alternatives to the mainstream. I'm stunned to hear tweens talking about consent issues, about their LGBT friends, or self-identifying as ""pansexual"" - none of that was even imaginable as a young adult two decades ago. 

Back then, I was married and a military dependent.   Now I'm divorced and on civilian Healthcare.   That makes it difficult to compare some things. "

Eventually I lost so much weight they put me in a psych hospital and started treatment for anorexia. Basically, I had to eat lots and lots, and have therapy about my body image and calories and stuff. It didn't help, obviously.

259,"Manic pixie dream girl. It's a trope in pop culture where an extraordinarily average dude happens upon a girl, generally quirky and cute, who's entire purpose in the story is to transform the male character.

283,"Not only is it a negative view towards women as a whole, it can turn women against each other in a sense. I remember when I was still young and impressionable, I liked it when other dudes said I wasn't like other girls. It meant I was ""cool"" and part of the ""boys club"" and that I was allowed to chill with the bros, and the other girls were just too dramatic for that. This attitude also crept into my relationships. I tried so hard to be the ""chill girlfriend"" that is down for everything and never makes a fuss about anything. First of all, I just want to state how emotionally taxing that is. I never got to express any issues I had in the relationship because I was afraid of losing my ""cool girlfriend"" status and I let that boil up in me.

286,"He made the false assumption that all food was shared food, even at restaurants.  I do this thing where I eat the parts of the food I don't like first, then I eat the part I like the most.

I'm angry right now thinking about this."
287,"He has such sweet pet names for me that makes me feel safe, pampered, and loved. Babydoll is a favorite. There's a number of kinkier ones x~x

Anyway!! He kisses and touches me often. We exchange ""I love you"" every five minutes (we've been together four years and have twins). He picks up snacks I like without asking. He lets me have the corner seat in the booth. He stands between me and strangers. And traffic. He cuddles me closely every night and grumbles a sweet little protest if I have to get up to check on the babies (assuming he hasn't already, he's amazing). He puts all he has into every single meal he makes and oh my fuck he is such an amazing cook...

He's so patient. So creative, so loving, so accepting. Even his laziness is a plus in the way it manifests- there's no one else that I'd rather spend 5+ hours cuddling and dozing with. "
288,"Whiplash. It got me on the edge of my seat for the entire last scene, the tension is just so good."
289,"Very good. The ways in which we are different give us balance; we are each strong in each other's weak points, so the end result is we're much better off as a pair than we are single. 

For instance, I tend to be highly emotional, spontaneous and very headstrong when it comes to getting my heart set on an idea, even if it's something as simple as where to go for dinner. He has a very narrow emotional range and doesn't tend to pursue his preferences or decisions.

So to me, he brings a real stability and sort of unchanging emotional base that I need to feel safe and secure; to him, I bring more spontaneity, more excitement and the basic function of making lofty plans and achieving them. With me, he's travelled the world -- something he always wanted to do but always seemed to overwhelming to plan.

Similarly, I plan for the future; he's more focused on the present. I'm financially savvy; thinking about money stresses him out. He is a great cook, I often just won't feed myself if I can't throw it in the microwave. 

So together, I get our personal finances sorted out and have long-term plans for our happiness and stability; he ensures our day to day life is successful, we have good food on the table, and he has really pushed me to be more attentive to cleanliness and order. 

Ultimately, we just function well as a partnership. As soon we got together, our lives improved significantly. I never dated anyone so different from me before, but it turns out it works perfectly."

I wouldn't have an abortion either but I'm 0% pro-life and a 100% pro-choice. Pro-life doesn't mean that you believe in choice and *choose* for yourself to carry to term - that actually still falls under the definition of pro-choice. Pro-life is the *political* position that abortions should be *legally forbidden*. That's the meaning of this expression. "

I now have my own kid, and before I tell her how beautiful she is, I tell her how smart she is. "
297,"My ex was a lite version of this guy - he had rich cousins and was constantly comparing what he got to what they got, and it was so annoying listening to it because I got NONE of that shit. He got to go on a ton of fancy vacations with his cousins, which included a free 3-week European trip for his cousin graduating high school. But he always complained that his cousins got so much more than he did. When I was growing up my dad had a full time and a part time job, we didn't go on vacations (or if we did they were road trips and sleeping in the car) and I had never even left the country in my life, so trying to be supportive was a real effort.

I supported him through a year of unemployment and he couldn't even clean up after himself. At one point I was cleaning and grabbed a rag that was filled with cold splooge, and almost vomited on the computer (that I bought him because he had crap credit).

He also did the thing you mentioned with expecting other people to pick up the check almost all of the time - my parents, my sister, ME. This is the one thing I look back on and feel the worst about, that he took advantage of not just me, but the people I care about.

Laughably though, he ended up breaking up with me after almost 5 years because I didn't want to watch TV with him for 6+ hours a day and go out drinking every single night. I helped him move out and he took with him some of my furniture because he didn't have any, like it was my fault he was 33 and had never lived alone or done anything responsible in his life. He also wanted me to cosign a car loan for him since his credit was horrific, while he was breaking up with me. Hmm, nope.

I was pretty distraught he literally told me that he thought I wasn't good enough for him. When I told people this, they typically laughed and said he had it backward, that they had always thought I was settling for HIM instead. Maybe he found what he wanted in the end though, he's dating a lady who makes like 150,000 a year but works 80+ hours a week and never takes time off. 

I definitely found what I wanted though, I married a super awesome guy whose features include being a functional grownup! yay!"
298,"A big wedding is fine, if you and your fiance pay for it. Having a big wedding on someone else's dime just seems wrong these days.  The father of the bride is no longer expected to foot the entire crazy bill.

300,"I worked a lot, especially from home. I was free during the weekends because she has a dad so I used that time to do errands for money and go out with friends. I also went to university in the meantime. Most childcare in my country is free so school was never an issue, and neither was university (free too).

My parents helped some, but most of the time I was alone with my daughter living in a house I rented myself at a low price.

Frankly, I don't know anything else so I can't compare, but she's had a great life so far and I've had wonderful years alongside her. Wouldn't trade that for anything in the world, even if it meant having her so young.

Like how everyone should be able to drive around with no license or insurance or current tags on their car. Because he kept forgetting to renew his tags and would lose his shit and get fined. But obviously it was the *laws* that were at fault. He also liked to go to the ER for things then just not pay. Because he 'shouldn't have to'. And he 'shouldn't have to' update his card information when his debit card changed and it was 'bullshit' that his power would get cut off. More than once. Like...you know you got a new debit card. They mail you updates that you haven't paid. They mail you updates you still haven't paid. They mail you updates that they're going to disconnect. He just refused to check his mail more than once every month. He also 'deserved' a nice car then it was 'bullshit' that no one would finance him because he didn't make much money and had shit credit (wonder why). Luckily for him his parents bought him a Porsche and then he inherited a house, which is now just a drug den from what I hear. Congrats. I figure at some point he'll forget to pay the property taxes too and just lose it.

310,"It's beyond rude and inconsiderate. It's forcing somebody to have a sexual interaction with you that they didn't consent to. This is the same behavior that drives everything from flashing and masturbating in public to catcalling, sexual assault (the casual ""grab her ass in the bar as she goes by"" kind to the premeditated, ""trap her physically or socially so she can't refuse"" kind) to rape.
 
When you flash people on the street, you get arrested and end up on a list with the rapists and the child abusers because it's considered deviant and abusive behavior. Sending a photo of your penis is no different from flashing people on the street like a stereotypical pervert in an overcoat. Guys who do this are not ""getting off on exhibitionist behavior"". They're getting off on being a fucking **sex offender**. Do we need to start a list for these guys, too? Maybe that will start convincing the male population that *you don't fucking force people to interact with your penis*."

321,"&gt; ""I can't read minds"" and complaining about a woman not telling the guy what is bothering her or what she wants: By my experience it's almost always because she already said that before and nothing changed, or the guy discouraged her to talk either by talking like expressing a negative feeling = nagging or by overreacting.

I think this is *so* spot on. One of my friends, for example, will ask me what's wrong / did he do something wrong but if I honestly answer he gets defensive or rude about it. Even if it's something simple like asking him to address me by my first name instead of a nick name. "

338,"Over the summer I had an issue with my spine which left me unable to sit upright. We found out it was a herniated disc. We tried all non-surgical options first (physical therapy, steroid injections, narcotic pain meds, etc). Eventually it got worse, so we ended up having to schedule surgery to fix the issue. The day of the surgery, my parents and boyfriend were at the hospital with me. They did a pregnancy test (routine procedure before an operation). After a while, they had asked everyone to leave and spoke to me privately. Turns out my test came back positive. I asked them to bring my boyfriend (now fiancé) in. I told him. We both cried (happy tears). It was a shock, but I wasn't scared. We want to have kids, so I think initially we were going to keep it. My mom even said she was thrilled. Not the best timing, but a happy surprise. 

After speaking with my doctors, it was clear that they would not move forward with the much needed spine surgery. If I were to keep the child, I was risking permanent nerve damage to myself. Additionally, we met with my OB, and she explained that with all the meds I'd been on, and all the procedures I've already had done, that it was unlikely that the fetus would be viable. We scheduled the abortion for the following week. 

It was, by far, the hardest thing I've ever had to do. I remember sitting in the holding area before the procedure. They bring you back there alone, my SO had to wait in the waiting room. I remember sitting there with that IV-I just wanted to pull it out and run out of there. I will say that the nurses took excellent care of me. One of the nurses checked on me and saw me crying. She asked if I was crying because I was scared of the procedure, or if I was crying for the loss. I responded ""both"". 

When in the room for the procedure, that nurse was next to me. When they were getting me ready, I turned to her and asked if I would remember the procedure. She responded ""it's my job to make sure that you don't"". That is the last thing I remember. 

It was an extremely hard decision to make. I'm still pretty heartbroken about it. Luckily my partner has been supportive. I know it hurts him, too. And I know not everyone who's gone through this is as lucky as I am. "

It's total and utter betrayal, showing a lack of respect or loyalty for your relationship or your partner's feelings. Who would want to be with someone like that? 

Just because there are worse things that can happen, doesn't negate the fact that cheating is still awful and 100% a justifiable reason to break things off with someone.   

It would be disgusting to tell a person who was cheated on ""Hey, at least they don't abuse you, amiright!?"". You can't just create a hierarchy of relationship issues like that."
343,"Oh oh! I have an excellent one for this!

Last July I had an extremely bad cold. Thought I could push through it and come to work that week. By Friday I couldn't get out of bed, lost my voice and was just a wreck.

Went to work on Monday feeling better, told coworker that the rest helped and that I went to see a movie Sunday night. She flipped out on me telling me I shouldn't have taken a sick day if I went to the movies two days later. She's been ignoring me since July. She made my job incredibly difficult and I wasn't able to get half the shit done that I needed to do because she would straight up ignore me instead of work with me and I failed my ""performance review"" because I refused to apologize and be a door mat to her."

I've worn more obvious outfits (a sheer t-shirt with a heavy men's jacket on top of it, strategically pinned or taped for nip coverage) and yes, occasionally people say things to me. It's usually only older women who will say anything negative, usually along the lines of 'what if your boobs sag' or 'what if it gets cold in here'. Most people who notice either just make an obvious effort to not stare at cleavage, or they just complement the outfit."

357,"Many years ago, I was seventeen and living in Indiana. I had basically zero sex ed and limited internet access (super Christian mom). I had just had my first period, and it was awful. My doctor recommended hormonal birth control to help regulate me  (because I started menstruating so late) and help with the dysmenorrhea, but my mom screamed at him and called me a whore. So, no pill for me.

My boyfriend of three years and I had, secretly, just started having sex, and were using condoms. It was only the third or fourth time we did it, and the condom came off inside me.

I left school during lunch, and snuck over to the drugstore down the street to get Plan B. I could not get it because I was a minor. I was going to have to tell my mom.

I told my mom what happened, and she flipped out and beat the stuffing out of me. She even made me transfer schools so I wouldn't see my boyfriend anymore. I still got no Plan B. After a month or so, I discovered I was pregnant.

My mom found the pregnancy tests in my bathroom trash while I was at school. She took me out of school and hauled me to a Crisis Pregnancy Center. They gave me a pregnancy test, which was positive like the others. They showed ne a model of my ""six-week-old baby,"" which was just a tiny baby doll and not at all medically accurate. They gave me an ""ultrasound,"" which showed a baby--despite the fact that six weeks along is too early to see anything.

I worked next to a grocery/health food store, and went over there during break and bought pennyroyal tea and parsley. I drank the tea and shoved the parsley inside me as a pessary in the hopes of inducing miscarriage. I started smoking cigarettes. Nothing happened. I considered using a coat hanger or knitting needle, but I was too scared and couldn't figure out how. I never even gave a thought to whether I wanted to abort or have the baby--I was in panic mode and just wanted the entire situation to disappear.

I never told my mom that I wanted an abortion. She had been a teen mom when I was born, and often said that she regretted having me. So, one day, she had me take $600 out of the bank (all my savings at that point) and drove me to an abortion clinic.

The first day they made me watch a video and look at an ultrasound. I don't remember exactly how far along I was--barely too far along for the abortion pill. There was a heartbeat. The next day, I had to come back for the procedure. I was given no painkillers, as my mom would not give permission for so much as a tylenol. I had never been to a gynecologist or had a pelvic exam before, so I had no idea what to expect. It REALLY hurt, but I was glad when it was over. Until my mom started telling everyone we knew that I'd had an abortion. That sucked. I became persona non grata in my entire community. I moved far away the day I graduated high school, and put myself through college and grad school. I haven't spoken to my mom or anyone from my family or hometown since.

I have never regretted having an abortion.

I do regret the way the situation was handled, and that a scared teenager was allowed to be treated that way. I do regret that I got pregnant at all--I wanted hormonal contraceptives, and I wanted Plan B. Had I access to those things, I would not have needed an abortion in the first place. I took the pill diligently for ten years after I turned 18, and never had so much as a pregnancy scare until my husband and I decided to have children on purpose. Hormonal contraception *works,* so long as girls and women have unhindered access to it, know how to use it properly, and are properly advised which method will do its job best for them. That's the best way to prevent abortions and reduce their numbers. Nobody WANTS to end up having an abortion. It's humiliating and painful. But everyone--even (or especially) teenagers--should be able to get one if they need it."

He has a very low libido, and had been pressured by previous girlfriends to have sex more often than he liked, so he kind of understood how I felt about things.

So we have sex maybe once or twice a month. It's often enough for him to be satisfied, and infrequent enough that I don't mind indulging him. And he's shown me that if I need to stop halfway through, or if I'm just not in the mood for it, he backs right off and we just cuddle and watch cartoons instead. He's the best."

My hair is very think and I've shaved my whole life, so the lady, who spoke very little English, was having a hard time. She would give me a comforting little pat on the coochie after every strip. It was so painful, and when it was done it looked like my pussy had mange. It was terrible.

2) I had some home wax strips, and as my boyfriend had kind of a hair removal fetish/fascination I told him he could try waxing a small area. He decided to start with the area right beside my pussy, like the little patch between my leg and my lip. I guess he was holding my lip down when he pulled, because my skin between my big and little pussy lip literally tore all the way down. It was so painful and bled so much, but the look on his face was so priceless it was almost worth it. He was so horrified that he couldn't even talk.

That is part of it - being shamed.

I look totally normal and I almost NEVER use my handicap parking placard... but... when I do - you can always bet there is someone glaring at me.

Making assumptions about me. It really gets into the core of you sometimes. Makes you feel crazy some days.

For anyone interested in understanding a little deeper - [the Spoon Theory](https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/) is an excellent explanation on how these kinds of illnesses can impact your day.

On a side note: One of the weirdest things I have had to adjust to is when someone who is ""healthy"" (aka not disabled, no diagnosed disorder) starts complaining about a pain or a discomfort they have. In my brain I am thinking ""if you only knew"" - but I also have to accept the fact that just because I experience intense and chronic pain very frequently - it doesn't mean their reality is any less valid. 

However, it gets really hard when you politely decline an activity and give a generic (but still true) reason why, and another person chimes in and ""one ups"" you with something they perceive as ""worse than you"" and basically tells you to ""suck it up"" and do said activity.

It then becomes a balancing act on whether or not to out yourself in defense or to just take it and look like a lazy fool.

Luckily my husband and the friends that know about this usually have my back and sort of shut it down - but it happens very, very frequently oddly. 

People love to one-up, especially with no context."

Now, it of course seems gross and strange - *we were kids* - but it's scary to think I really can't remember when it started, when it became *part* of the walk.  It's scary that I just always remember that walk including a few honks, a few choice words and a few adjustments of our shorts which suddenly felt too short. "

413,"Every single discussion about adoption is riddled with people saying, ""I'd adopt because there are so many babies needing a loving family!""  That's not true.  I don't know where this notion comes from.  There is a long, long wait time for infants, the absolute opposite of an abundance.  There are older children available for adoption in the foster system, but research has shown that in most cases, outcomes are better if kids stay with their biological families, even when those families are troubled so the virtuousness of that system is in question too.

Infant adoption is also fraught with troubles that we don't like to talk about.  Why don't we support lower income, women of color, and younger parents in parenting rather than coercing them into relinquishing?  Why is it seen as a ""step up"" for children of color to be adopted by white families?  What about the suffering many adoptive mothers live with for the 18 years that they are separated from their child?

Adoption in general isn't a virtuous act.  It's a means to a desired end (parenthood) just like pregnancy.  And by the way, there's nothing wrong with wanting to be a parent.  It's fundamentally normal.  Adoption is still a viable option, of course, and there are biological parents who genuinely welcome the opportunity to relinquish their child to a chosen family.  But we should stop glorifying it and the discussion should revolve around an honest assessment of the system."

415,"&gt; But to be absolutely clear--I would never again get another abortion for these reasons, but that is my choice for myself. I don't have the right to make that choice for other women. So I am personally pro-life, but I am politically pro-choice. I would never judge another woman for making her own choice with respect to her body.

Isn't that still pro-choice though? Pro choice means that you have the right to choose for yourself, and you've chosen to not have abortions, where as pro life would mean you are against abortions 100% and would not allow anyone else to have an abortion. "

So when he rejects me, my immediate emotion is crushing rejection. I feel unattractive. I feel embarrassed.

Then I get over myself.

I remember that he chooses to be with me every day. I remember that he *loves* having sex with me. I remember that even though the mere thought of him gets my motor going, there are days when even I don't want to have sex, simply because I'm emotionally not in the mood or I'm tired or whatever.

If I'm already depressed or stressed or a combination of the two I can think of nothing worse than going out shopping in person to all the busy shops full of other people getting in my way and generally being annoying. I find trying on clothes a necessary evil in shops but I get SO HOT and that stresses me more. I swear they deliberately crank up the heating in those places. Plus spending too much money will probably make me feel bad again.

We were engaged for a year before the wedding, he didn't give butterflies in my stomach. The marriage was against my wishes (he didn't know) cuz I was asked to stop studies. The first night was weird for me (I had made out with my ex'es before but never sex). But slowly over time I started enjoying it. He's good at foreplay. Sex aside, I'm glad it's him I am married to. Unlike most of the people in my community he's pretty progressive even though a bit religious. Example, he doesn't drink, but has no problem with me drinking.

I hit puberty at the average age that most black girls do, and my breasts came in incredibly quickly.  I was probably a D cup by the time I was 11.

I had previously been wearing undershirts beneath all of my clothes (something I still do to this day), but when I was about 9, my mom said I had to stop, and took me bra shopping for the first time.  I got cute little nothing bras at first, but later that year, my mom took me to the adult section to get me some real bras.  She spent a long time scrutinizing each bra to make sure it wasn't ""inappropriate"", and didn't have any sort of lace or frills on it at all.  

I asked her why I couldn't wear bras like the others that were in that section, and while I can't remember her response word for word, the idea was that I didn't want to appear ""fast"" and give people the wrong idea.

That's also the year that my dad gave me the ""don't let anyone touch you in these three places"" conversation that I really didn't understand at the time.

I was first hit on when I was 10, but that was the first time I felt like I made my debut from being a little, innocent girl to something that men would fuck."

438,"He told me the reason he doesn't text me back during the day is because he works hard and I ""sit in an office all day on my phone."" 

He had a lot of making up to do that night "

Judging from her social media she is living the same lifestyle. She is quite an attractive person, and spends a lot of time on her appearance so she does well on social media. Some minor beauty brands even sponsor her, like a lip injection place she goes to for example. So no, I don't think she learns from it, but maybe at some point karma will catch up to her.

If the GOP starts the process, it will look good on them when their terms come up for reelection.  "
442,"When it's late at night, there's more than one person behind me, and I'm alone, yes. "
443,"I get ""oooh, what a waste"". Why, because women don't deserve hot women too? It makes me sick. "
444,I like the way you said that. You seem like a nice person.
445,"Guns

No thanks"
446,"Wow.... I just had a chuckle reading the part about the bloke ""levitating above the bed while spinning in mid air to completely burrito himself"". I commend you on your way with words and just upvoted your comment."
