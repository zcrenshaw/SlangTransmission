FREE SPEECH MEANS THE **GOVERNMENT** CANNOT CENSOR YOU, IT DOES NOT MEAN OTHER PEOPLE OR INSTITUTIONS CAN'T TELL YOU YOU'RE BEING AN ASSHOLE AND ARE NOT WELCOME. "
1,"I was totally and completely alone for Christmas one year. I made my dog a stocking and wrapped presents for her the night before, then carried her down on Christmas morning and opened them for her. She was the only living thing I talked to all weekend. I cried and felt so lucky to have her. 

Edit: [Here she is.] (http://imgur.com/i29RksL) Isn't she sweet? :) "
2,"i was the ugly friend. she was this gorgeous german exchange student. long blonde hair, very nice pear shaped figure. every time we went out, floods of compliments, getting things for free, the bartenders pulling out all the tricks trying to impress her. it was like i didn't even exist.

then the universe threw the most massive curveball and she kissed me one night while we were hanging out. me! the frumpy, fat, ugly friend who lived in her shadow. she said she had been hoping and praying i was into girls because she thought i was so sexy and cute. i ruined things because of my own insecurity and i still hate myself for it so many years later. but god damn was that the life lesson of the century."

6,"By remembering that even if I had to tell them, they're still doing it because they want to. In any healthy relationship, both partners should want to make each other happy. If my SO tells me they want me to do something, then yes, I do it ""because they asked me to,"" but that's because I want to do what they want me to do. I'm not a mind reader. I need help to know what things I should be doing, because what I want is to make them happy. I try to remember the same is true for my partner, and not worry so much about it.

Edit: It appears I misread the question: I though OP was asking what we do when we're caught in that cycle, not what we're currently caught in that cycle about. My mistake!"
7,"This is a silly one, but when I ask for my SO's opinion of my outfit/appearance, I genuinely want his honest feedback! I never say ""does this make me look fat?""  I try to ask him more specific questions, like ""does this top make me look like I don't have a waist?"" Or ""do these pants make my hips look wider than they actually are?"" He just yells TRAP! And then gives me a bs answer, like ""you look great no matter what babe!"" I mean maybe sometimes it's honest, maybe the top really doesn't hide my waist, but it's reached the point in which I ask our male housemate for his opinion because I trust him more.

The whole ""woman asks his opinion solely to make herself feel better and then gets upset when he's honest"" is such a pervasive societal meme. Do women really do that and then get mad if he's critical? Or do men just assume we're gonna get mad but never actually find out because they don't want to risk it? I'm sure it's a little bit of both. It's just frustrating because I genuinely want his feedback! "
8,"I slept on my sofa during a breakup because when you have your back to the sofa back, it feels like someone else is there"
9,"He had developed a huge crush on his office colleague who he used to work with for 12 hours of the day. And repeatedly he was prioritising her over me.When I had had enough, I gave him an ultimatum that it was either her or me.I cut off contact with him for the week to have him come back with an answer. He dumped me later that week saying he had already cheated on me with her two months back and no longer had feelings for me. He dint have the balls to come clean to me during the two months and the ultimatum gave him courage to do the ""right"" thing. "
10,"I proposed to my SO at Christmas. We'd had a general conversation about getting married, and he'd brought home a ring sizer, so I knew he was serious. But I was ready and wasn't interested in waiting for him to summon the courage.

I bought him a ring. It's even got a stone - an amethyst. I put the ring box in the bottom of his Christmas stocking, and when he opened it I just said, ""Well, can we get married now?""

He said yes, then ran into the bedroom and came back with the ring he bought me, got down on his knee and proposed right back. Although we bought each other surprise rings, my ring also has amethyst in it, so they match."
11,"Single now, but back during my birthday my ex said he was going to make it the best day ever for me because I always went all-out for him. I ended up crying in my dorm room all day, alone, because he failed to spend any time with me or even get me a present. Wouldn't have been so bad if he didn't talk it up to be something great, then completely forget about my existence. "
12,"I started out my last relationship as the other woman and the trust that I had for him was so low from the start. We were with each other all the time and constantly keeping tabs on one another when we weren't together. I made no time for my friends and isolated myself from everything. I went from being confident and happy to embarrassingly insecure in myself and my relationship.  So if you're thinking about it, just don't do it. There's so many other people out there and you should absolutely consider starting a relationship where you can trust the other person entirely because how it all started will always be in the back of your head. "
13,"Once, my best friend and I were walking through the mall and there was one of those kiosks that rents out to different businesses. The flavor of the week was some too-expensive skin goop, and there was a guy peddling samples. He extends his hand toward us (I was closer) and says, ""Sample for the pretty lady?"" I smiled and reached out to take it and the man violently snatches the sample backward and then informed me, ""It's for her."" in a really obvious tone and motioned to my friend who was frozen like a deer in headlights. I felt so awful and embarrassed, and I think he seemed to understand at that point and began to try to offer me another sample while I awkwardly distanced myself from the situation. It felt bad at the time but I chuckle when I think about it now. "
14,"I'm bisexual, and always preferred women, but I've dated more men because of so many queer women's attitudes towards bisexuality. 

In my attempts to ask ladies out, I've had so many lesbians tell me that bisexuality isn't real, or that I'm only interested in girls because guys like it, or that ""I don't date bisexual women because you'll just leave me for a man."" 

While I still dated some women - mostly other bi ladies - those attitudes drove me out of the lesbian dating scene in my area, and also acted as a gatekeeper keeping me out of spaces like Pride where I felt people might tell me I don't belong."
15,"When I'm having strong emotions and others write me off as bossy/PMSing/mouthy/emotional/*ad infinitum.* I'm allowed to have feelings, motherfucker."
16,"Sometimes I text myself to ""have a good day"" "
17,"""sticking my boobs out""

I have very large breasts. When I stand straight and don't hunch my shoulders they look larger. 

So no, I'm not standing with good posture to attract men, I'm doing it because I am 29 with terrible back problems from hunching my shoulders my whole life so that people would stop calling me a slut. 

Edit: in typical reddit fashion, you mention you have tits and men start swarming in to give their ""2 cents"". "
18,"I would watch this movie

19,"Apparently my unfeminine personality is faked to impress guys (I can assure you it doesn't work out quite like that, for the record)."
20,"Right? I'm SO sick of people claiming free speech means you should get to do whatever you want with no repurcussions. If you're an asshole, individuals and private institutions are entirely free to call you out and to not want to associate with you."
21,I cuddled the power brick of my laptop to keep warm while watching *Eternal Sunshine* on repeat.
22,"my mom. a year ago almost to this day, we were talking on skype. i humoured her for 2 fucking hours talking about nothing except the only topics she can talk about (weddings, babies, interpersonal drama), being as pleasant as one can be with tedium like that. when it came time to leave, she thought she hung up but she didn't. i listened as she ranted to my sister about how i was ignoring her, thought i was too good for them, and she doesn't know why she ever bothered with me. i'm pretty sure there was more, but i think i had a dissociative episode in the middle.

naturally, when i gathered myself, called back and confronted her, there was insistence that it had been the TV, that i had heard wrong, and when all that failed, hysterical tears.

fuck that, it was just the excuse i needed to cut her off. i always hated the fake-nice-talk-shit bait and switch, but this was just too much.

(felt good to write this, thanks!)"
23,"I hiked the Niagara Falls trail, entire Canadian and entire American side, all by myself. Got there at sunrise, finished at sunset. Watched the fireworks all by myself before driving home. Cuddled with a kitty in one of the random parks during my hike. It was actually pretty nice, until I was crossing the border back into Detroit early the next morning and the border guard didn't believe me that I went to Niagara Falls to go hiking by myself. He said no one goes to Niagara Falls alone, it's the honeymoon capital, couples go there, I must have been meeting someone. Then I felt kind of bad that I didn't have anyone to go with. Almost cried trying to explain to guard that I'm single, no prospects, no friends who would go with me, and I just really wanted to see the falls. Stupid guard ruined what was actually a pretty nice day trip. 
Edit: found the picture of the random cat I cuddled at the falls https://m.imgur.com/AWpm2pu"
24,"Yes. All through high school, guys would only talk to me to get with my two really gorgeous best friends. I was called ugly in middle school too. Just overall the ugly duckling, I used to call myself a potato too. Looking back, I wasn't. I wish I had a higher self esteem then. I'm 19 now and I'm still working on my confidence and it's not easy. I really believed I was ugly but I definitely wasn't, I was pretty darn cute! No one approached me either but that's likely because i was unapproachable. 

My biggest tip, get out of the ""ugly girl"" mindset. I carried myself like I believed I was the ugly friend and it really showed. I'm sure there are many people who find you attractive. It's hard to approach someone who appears like they have low confidence. Just think, I'm sure you know someone who isn't the most physically attractive but they have a charm or confidence that draws people to them. Work on your good inner qualities and it will shine on the outside. Trust me! I've been there. I wish I could give you a hug because I totally understand how you're feeling.

Walk with good posture, smile more and be the kind of person you want to be around. Also remember, just because she's pretty doesn't mean you're not! There are different kinds of beautiful and everyone is unique.

25,"Of course Harvard was right. You have to be a real idiot to post racist memes on a website where your real name is attached to everything you do. Nobody that stupid should go to Harvard. You wanna be edgy and controversial for the sake of likes, be ready for the consequences."
26,"I'd always been the grenade in my friend group. In addition to being pudgy and improved by a paper bag on my head, I was the poor kid in a rich town who always had awful clothes (way too big, full of holes, that kind of thing). Despite all this, I was the only one to have a long term boyfriend in high school (3 years to their 3 week relationships).  However, he even told me in his love letters ""you may not be the prettiest girl but...."" And now, at 28, I've cast off a lot of those friends. I'm really only close with one of the pretty ones now. She still hasn't had a relationship for longer than a year or so and....she was my maid of honor at my wedding. Being fugly helped my confidence rise. I have ZERO fear of rejection. That high school boyfriend? I asked him out (he said no at first but then changed his mind). When I met my husband, it was on a dating website. They say women get bombarded on those things....I did not. I got a few nibbles but not even close to what other women experience. And any of the men with substance that I was really interested in....I messaged first, including my husband. He's a lot more attractive than I am, so I have hope for any children we may have, but he's a total dork and an introvert. I may be ugly but I'm the most fun motherfucker you'll meet. I dance like nobody's watching - because they really aren't lol"

29,"I had a feeling he wasn't brushing his teeth often (or at all), so I put a little glob of tooth paste on the tip of his dry brush to see how long it would sit there. A week later, I was at his apartment again, and the brush was still sitting there with this dry glob of paste on top. Nope, nope, nope, nope. We had a come to Jesus talk about how I NEED him to get on board with brushing at least once a day (preferably twice), and if he couldn't do that, then I'm out. It was a tough talk at first because he said he didn't really think he needed to, it wasn't that important, etc. I made it clear that him having old milk/rotten egg breath was affecting my attraction to him severely and that I simply could not be in this relationship if this were to continue. He listened, understood, and we've been fine since. And I feel a lot better about kissing him. "

31,"During the seven years my boyfriend and I have been together there was only one time I issued an ultimatum.

He did and that was about four years ago. It's been mostly uphill since!"

46,"Not me, but my roommate is a waitress at a sports bar.

It is unbelievable how often women will scream at her for apparently flirting with their boyfriends while she's waiting their table or bringing them drinks. My roommate is in a long term relationship, and on top of that she is only trying to be friendly to the group to provide good service and to hopefully receive a good tip. I think a lot of women assume this just because my roommate is quite good looking and I guess view her as a threat?

It's quite horrible, though. Normally these tables won't tip her, and the customers screaming in your face is an awful way to end the night."

49,"My dad's pretty bad. He's actually an incredibly sensitive person, but growing up in the South in the 50's, that didn't go over well for a boy.

The result is that as an adult he never talked about his feelings, never told his family members he loved them, etc. When something would happen to me as a kid - if I got hurt, or got lost, he would yell at me for ""getting"" myself hurt. 

As a kid, I was just afraid of being yelled at. And then one day as a teenager I stepped on a bottle and cut my foot open, and my dad started screaming at me for ""not watching where I was going"", and I just realized that he wasn't really angry at me - he was afraid for me and upset I was injured. But because of how he was taught to be ""manly"", the only way he knew to react was to get angry at the world for hurting me. And since it was useless to scream at the world, he screamed at me instead.

In his 60s and 70's, he's learned to talk more, to open up about things he feels other than anger, etc., but it took losing a lot of his friends and having to care for them through cancer etc for him to start learning its okay to tell someone you love them, and to miss them when they're gone, and to be sad and afraid instead of angry."

56,"Rough stuff.

I'm sexually submissive and love getting slapped, choked, etc....

But a guy who just assumes those things are cool before we've talked about limits and a safe word and all of that is never having sex with me again."
57,"Sometimes it bothers me, but it's sort of always been my life so I've never really payed much attention to it. I think it helps to be confident about your personality, and to realize that anyone who would give you less attention based on how you look is just not worth your time.

I can definitely relate to your experiences though. It does really suck when I go out with my super pretty friends (I mean, all my friends are beautiful, but I mean coventionally pretty) and they just get constant compliments from random strangers. I can't imagine what that's like.

Another ugly friend consequence is that I'm less likely to be in my friend's selfies. This is probably a younger generation thing, but my friends will sometimes pull out their phones to post on their stories, and if we're in a group, they'll pose with others but I'm rarely the person included in their snapchats.

I guess to cope with it, I just accept that that's the way things are and that I just need to fight a little harder to get to people's hearts."

Both relationships ended with me being cheated on. I'd like to say it's something I deserved falling for it twice, I really should have recognized the pattern, but the circumstances at the start of both relationships were so different I hadn't put together that it was the same thing.

I was very trusting, blindsided both times, but I can take ""being too nice"" as a personality trait."

Then ONLY buy stuff you love and know what your personal style is. Get basics!!!!!!!
Chose a color palette that suits you. 

Mine is : black, grey, white, navy, red, rosy. 

I don't own anything in a different colour. I can put on ANYTHING in my wardrobe and it always matches and I just own one single tshirt, no leggings... 
Just different comfy clothes that still look stylish. 
This way even when I try to look like I didn't care, I still look out together. 

I actually started cleaning out my wardrobe only a year ago. It's not perfect, but many people commented on me always looking put together now. 


EDIT: somewhat unrelated: my boyfriend has almost the same colour palette than me. Neutrals with red and dark pink-red. 
He actually gave me the idea, since he has that color palette already long before we met. 
It's a coincidence that most of my clothes were the same palette already. 
We loved matching out clothes (both wearing grey jeans, him wearing a red sweater, me wearing a white blouse with red flowers...) when we started dating.I think it's fun to always somewhat ""fit"" together. Makes for great photos, always. "

67,"I haven't read a lot of bullshit, but The God Delusion infuriated me. I'm as atheist as they come, but when I read this argument: ""If religious people really believe in an afterlife, why are they sad when they find out they're going to die??"" Was just ridiculous. My mom died of a slow illness. She was very Catholic and believed in heaven. But she was very sad because she was *leaving her fucking children behind*. The night she knew she was going to die, she had to look us in the eye and say goodbye knowing she would never see us again. Does Richard Dawkins not understand human emotion? "

74,"When men feel the need to violently and aggressively defend ""their"" women. Like dudes who start bar fights because another man looked at their girlfriend. Or fathers who meet a new boyfriend with a shotgun in hand.

75,Dads being treated like sex offenders. Every dad I encounter is hailed as a hero for even acknowledging his kids. 
76,"Hay, I have been in both places. When I was young I was overweight and my closest friends have always been truly stunning. Once two guys were fighting for my hot friend's attention while we were at the beach and they didn't acknowledge me and one of them actually said to the other guy ""ew"" when referring to me. Mind it, I was almost 18, and had never even been kissed. I kept up the appearances in front of my friends, and joked about my ""nice personality"" which I do have. I did cry, I did feel worthless when I was alone and thought about it, but I kept a smile on my face and everyone liked who I was despite me not being the one they first picked to fuck....

Here is the catch though, I managed to lose weight, I love fashion so I'd say i dress well? I'm super fit. I can't go to the supermarket and buy tampoons without being hit on by a guy, no jokes. Even when I try I'm still not invisible, there are always eyes on me.
And guess what?
It doesn't bring any happiness.

Guys will actively go out of their way to chase me, but all they want is photos, and lead up to sex. It feels gross, and it is hard to be able to have a friendship with a guy and get to know him, and know that he actually likes WHO I am. At the end of the day, I'm not any happier than I was when I was the fat ugly friend. 

Take care of yourself, your body, your mind, be the best version you can be, learn to dress for your shape, and don't worry about it because when people compliment you, they will truly be seeing who you are, more than your looks. When a guy/girl fall for you, it will be for who you are, they will be chasing you for your special qualities, they will be seeing beyond your looks (which, btw, just because your friend attracts a lot of attention it doesn't mean you are not good looking too!). 

Don't compare yourself to her either. Pretty doesn't bring happiness. "
77,"I have a couple of tops that don't show the outline (or not obviously). They're flowy and made of a slippery material that's just thick enough. Patterns help too, like small floral prints if that's compatible with your style.

80,"okay. some background: i'm a freelance writer, i write for several big magazines and mainstream online publications. one of the many topics i cover is tech, and i can't tell you how many times i've had men unknowingly parrot MY OWN GODDAMN ARTICLES at me when trying to ""prove"" i'm just a fake geek girl for all the, uh, male attention or whatever it is us fake geek girls are attempting to steal. "
81,"I've given up on explaining this to my family:

I'm repulsed by the existence of insults like ""bitch"", ""pussy"", ""be a man"", ""throw like a girl"", ""man up"", etc... and my male family members say those things a lot. I can't explain to someone why I'm offended by these things. When I say ""The problem is that competence, toughness, intelligence, integrity, and both physical and emotional strength are summed up by the phrase 'being a man' and not 'being an adult' because society sees these as male traits"", the person I'm talking to says ""But that's just the bad parents because the good ones teach the boys that being a man means all those things and the girls that being a woman means those same things""

SHUT UP! It's not about whether you raise your kids to be functioning adults. It's about the fact that you claim to not hate women and still degrade female traits to the point that you're shouting at your 4 year old daughter to ""be a man"" after she scrapes her knee."

86,"The other day I was speaking to my SO and let out some remark that I wish he would buy me more flowers. Simple. He said he would, and you'd think that'd be a done deal. But then I did that thing, you guys; I said, ""But no, now that I said it, then you're only buying it because I told you to.""

Now, I like to think that I'm a decently mature person with a decently mature idea of relationships; yet, somehow, I can't avoid this line of thought!

So anyway... I'll start! I never thought I was a ""flowers"" type of person until I got flowers one day from an SO and realized that I *loved* it; it wasn't the flowers themselves but the thought behind them, the fact that he was probably grocery shopping, saw the flowers, and thought of me. So, getting your SO flowers randomly is a great way to remind them that you love them! "

107,"If it was literally ""leave now or shit my pants"", of course the better option is to leave. Twice, I had to pee really badly in the middle of important meetings. I used to be an awful alcoholic and the urge to pee would come out of nowhere and wouldn't wait for anyone. Yes I'd be drunk at work, it was awful (been sober for 10 years now!). 

But I didn't want to explicitly say I had to pee, especially since there were like 20 people in the room, so the first time I suddenly clutched my eye as if I was in pain, and whispered, ""I'm so sorry, my contact lens is stuck"" and excused myself. I don't wear contact lenses so I don't even know if that makes sense, but people bought it. 

The second time, I faked an awful coughing fit, like when you drink water and it goes down the wrong pipe. I just signalled to my throat and left the room. Everyone else just thought I was super responsible for removing myself and not disrupting the meeting.

Even if you don't traditionally celebrate christmas, all your friends are bound to be busy, places are shut, etc! Your dog's adorable. I would've loved to have someone to keep me company. The loneliest thing I did that night was go for a walk around the block at night. I walked past rows and rows of houses all lit up and I could hear families inside having dinner. I thought I'd spend the time with my ex in the home we shared. Standing outside my front door in the dark, knowing nobody would be there when I went inside, was the loneliest thing I've ever done in my life. "

Sometimes that's true, but I've had coworkers in the private sector who are the same. There are shitty employees in every organization. But most of the public servants I've interacted with are hard workers, care about their jobs and want to do them well. 

Edit: Case in point: I was just in the elevator in my office building, which is occupied almost entirely by federal employees, and thus woman was in there loudly complaining to the person she was with about someone she knows: ""of course she took a job with the government, who wouldn't want to sit around scratching their butt for five hours rather than doing any real work?""

I sat in his driveway, cried a little, called him, knocked on the door...

Anyways, I needed coffee to warm me up, so I ended up at a, waffle house at 4am. I held that cup in my hands and tried really hard to figure out how I didn't see it coming. I remember thinking that there is nothing more lonely than a waffle house at 4am in the middle of nowhere"

151,"A former mentor who I used to think was teaching me the ropes and warning me about potential pitfalls at my job. I always used to wonder why she was stuck at the same position for 8 years, she used to be clear that she felt it was simple sexism. 

Well after a couple of rapid promotions for me it's become clear that she's just a horrible person. She wasn't teaching me the ropes, she was exploiting me into doing her work for her, she wasn't pointing out pitfalls, she was just creating drama between me and perfectly nice people. 

Once it became obvious that other women could and did receive promotions/advancements, it wasn't sexism to blame anymore. It was that those women were 'too-friendly' with their bosses (nudge nudge wink wink) and she doesn't do that. The Indian lady, oh she was promoted because it's political correctness gone mad, what's a poor white lady like her to do. 

Once I managed to repair the damage associating with her caused me, I've started doing well for myself. And I guess I should thank her a bit, doing her work for her turned out to be the best form of training for my current role and I'm acing it. "

He ended up being resentful and mean towards me (I think it's partially because his guilt over how it began) for most of the three years we had together. 

After him dismissing multiple desperate pleas for couples counseling, I got sick of his behavior and ended up leaving him for another guy (ironically). He made my life hell because of it.

153,"I mean, there was a lesson here: your conduct in other spaces has the power to open and close certain doors for you. 

As well, the students still have the ability to pursue education -- just not at Harvard (for now). 

And I'm not sure I follow that these students, who made it into Harvard, lacked education on social issues. Certainly you can expect a little crudeness from adolescents in terms of their world views, but these memes were about pedophilia, lynching, assault...to me, the argument that the students didn't know any better is really troubling. 

I tend to think in the other direction, and I hope more institutions enforce cultural standards like not participating in the circulation of hateful material. "

I suggested many times he go to a Dr, we go to therapy, asked him if it's something about me, etc, but his only answer was that he didn't need sex to be Happy. Which didn't make sense because we had a great sex life for the first couple of years (I suspect he was cheating but I never found out). I said if things didn't change then we were done because I need that form of intimacy. He tried, we had sex a couple times, but it felt so forced and non- intimate that we brow up anyways. "

I have actual shit to do and for random coworkers even to come up to me and be like ""since I know you aren't busy, could you do this for me?"" is extremely insulting. I am on my phone 24/7 even when I am at home or on a weekend, checking for emails and have to be readily available to pick up phone calls at 12:45am to coordinate an entire catered breakfast for an 8am meeting in 7 hours (this has happened before) I can 100% lend a hand but if they were to frame the question differently and say ""Hey, if you find the time in your bandwith to help me out that would be great!""

Everything came to a head a few weeks ago and she ran through my front door having been beaten. I spoke with law enforcement that I was certain the girl had been attacked first but they told me both the child and the step parent were claiming they were hit first. I talked about the emotional abuse that had been escalating and they yelled at me that they don't care about emotional abuse. No one was charged and her parents abandoned her with her unstable biological mom that night. She was dumped out of the frying pan and into the fire. I've taken some clothes and toiletries to her but things look grim. My heart breaks for her, I've spent the last 3 years getting to know her bright, happy, resilient face and have listened to that step mom tear her down bit by bit.

Literally every time we go somewhere in public men are craning their necks to see her and she doesn't even seem to notice! It hurts after awhile feeling so invisible next to her. Since I was little friends and family have made remarks about how gorgeous she is... and follow that up with ""you and your sister are total opposites!"" LOL. 

Going out to bars and such is tough. Guys come up to her fo flirt and act like I don't even exist. It's not to be mean, they simply don't notice me. She will introduce me and they dont give me the time of day. I don't deal with it very well, I tend to harbor a lot of jealousy and resentment. Luckily we have a very close relationship, she is humble and we still manage to have fun going out together.

I would say they key is her confidence but that would be a lie. I'm a very confident, outgoing person but men are just more attracted to her - it's a fact of life. In the long run we will all be old and wrinkly so I try not to dwell too much on it.

182,"So many men are deeply dissatisfied with the emotional intimacy in their lives and share only with their romantic partners. They're so lonely and have all this shit to work through that they could really use each other's support with, but won't open up to each other because they're afraid of losing whatever it is that masculinity gives them.

Edit: I want to add that this kind of isolation between men makes them feel/think that they're the Only Ones in their lives to experience whatever bullshit they're going through. While the women in my life see things like depression or dissatisfaction with their direction as just a fact of life or something that lots of people experience, the men in my life feel uniquely tormented. My roommate came home yesterday having an emotional meltdown about something he recognized as small but couldn't regulate his emotional response to. My friend and SO were there with me and we were all trying to talk him through it and kind of give him constructive outlets for his feelings. He kept harping on the fact that this Always Happens and nobody understands and he's just fucked up. It actually took me explaining that we had each actually been in an extremely similar situation and had developed ways to manage it for him to realize that he was being a melodramatic ass and that he needed to seriously consider making some changes to his life. Though most of the men in my life aren't this extreme, this is a fairly common attitude in my experience."

There is no reason to be such an ass to religious people. Just because someone believes in God does not automatically make them stupid or a bad person. As long as you're not harming others with your beliefs, the fuck does it matter?! I can't stand his condescending writing style either. My ex was a big fan and it caused a *lot* of arguments."

I overheard the classic ""look at how she dresses, she asked for it"" from a coworker when I was assaulted by a man at work.  My shirt was boat-neck.

Also I play a lot of video games, so many people have accused me of being that ""fake gamer girl"" to get guys to like me.  And while that one is mostly from dudes, a fair share of girls have said such things to me in person, wondering how I could actually enjoy games. "
193,"For me, the telltale sign of insecurity is not jealousy; it's when the hate normally projected to the other person is reflected back on yourself. For instance, if you see a beautiful woman walking down the street or talking to your partner, you don't hate her, you hate yourself. ie ""She's probably way smarter than me too. And super interesting. I'm just a stupid sharkface."""

197,"I would encourage them to keep them, maybe not display them, but definitely keep them. Photographs are nothing more than moments caught in time; a way to look back at fond memories.

198,"He had a woman in his life who was in his life just for casual sex. He didn't even really like her as a friend but every time they were both single they would have sex. In between that they would sometimes talk about work and a quick ""What's new?"" conversations online and they followed each other on social media. I told him I felt uncomfortable about this, you know, it was like she was there as a bench warmer. At first he said he didn't even talk to her unless she texted something about work or something he would respond and I think felt like he owed her to keep her in his life because they had known each other for years. I said something like ""You are free to have whoever you want in your life, I'm not telling you what to do. I'm telling you I'm free to not feel comfortable about this and if she will stay in your life, I won't."" He took some time to think then took her out of his life."

208,"People have weird double standards when it comes to dating. 

I've heard a few people complaining about women not dating them because of their appearance (the usual you know, I'm a nicer guy than the one she's dating, why does she always go out with assholes when I'd be the perfect man for her) but unsurprisingly, they not only never interacted with them but also refused to date someone who wasn't beautiful enough.

Like, you're physically attracted to only 1 of your coworkers, out of the 500+ women working here, and would never date anyone else because you don't feel anything towards them, why are you surprised that the one you got a crush on isn't attracted to you ?"
209,"A rape accusation ruining someone's life.

210,"When I was 20 and had ""guy friends"" over 50, I was not aware enough of social conventions to know that they were only spending time with me due to sexual desire. I honestly believed that they were intellectually stimulated by being around me, and thought that they were happy to be my friend.

It took a rape to get it through my head that there's a very low probability that a retiree wants to be friends with a college kid. I think that most men who are interested in much younger women are predatory or immature, even if they're not aware of it. The guys who went after me probably didn't think of themselves as predators, but they definitely took advantage of my lack of expertise and knowledge."
211,a six year old talking like that to a peer means that an adult was talking like that to her.

217,Women do not get free drinks thrown at them every time they go to a bar. Reddit seems to think that women have it easy when it comes to dating but they overlook all the average women they don't notice. 
218,We live in a house that he bought about a year ago and I moved into with him after a promise of marriage. No formal proposal but definitely implied. After 3 years together and my name not being on the house but me putting my money and my hard work on fixing up the house we had a come to Jesus talk about our relationship and what our future holds and I told him I needed a ring OR a life insurance policy/living will where I was the beneficiary should something happen to him. We have some financial stuff we've both been working on so that when we do get married we are not bringing a lot of personal debt into the marriage. So my ultimatum was more of a protection of an asset than a you have to choose me. We're both very much on the same page when it comes to the future of our relationship. 
219,"I get emotional about a man being the only breadwinner/trying to make more money and things on that line. More than once a woman implied I was responding that way to get men like me. In reality, my late dad was the only breadwinner of the house and worked even on his last day on earth, when he could barely see and was extremely tired. It reminds me of my dad, that's why I have a sensitive spot, not to get dudes like me."
220,"* Guys are rarely vocal in bed.  I like to get some verbal feedback, or at least a moan here and there but...

* Women are supposed to put on a performance.  Which means there are times when I can't focus on how something feels because I'm too concerned about whether I'm too loud or too quiet, if my belly is poking out in this position, if my back is arched in an attractive way, etc.  It's stressful and distracting. 

* Everyone needs to be ""kinky"" or into something besides ""vanilla"" sex.  I *do* happen to have some kinks, but there are times when I just want some boring missionary, and I don't like feeling like that's boring.  It's always rubbed me the wrong way when I've told people some of the stuff I like and I've been told that I'm like a pornstar?  It's like the sexy version of hearing that you're ""not like other girls"". Only these days the stuff I'm into is considered very close to vanilla, so. 

* Certain sex acts have just been considered standard and it was never asked if I'd be okay with it.  Anal, blowjobs (especially deepthroating; I don't like the idea of *literally fucking choking*, but some guys have tried to shove it down my throat without warning... holy fuck, no), cumming on me, and porn itself included.  

* Hairlessness, don't even get me started.  I had a traumatic experience with a high school boyfriend who was *shocked* that women could be hairy.  He went around and told everyone that I had a full bush and it was gross.  I found out about it in a really embarrassing and hurtful way.  Whatever.  I still have a very complicated relationship with my pubic hair. 

And, okay, this one isn't directly related to my sex life, but I haaaaaaaate when you're hanging out with someone and they just casually start playing porn like it's nothing.  Really, really bothers me. "

223,"I proposed one night in bed while we were cuddling. I didn't have a ring or anything. 

But the Christmas lights wrapped around my headboard were on so there was a soft red glow everywhere, there was rain pitter pattering outside, my cat was purring at the end of the bed, and I just thought it was a good moment.

I blurted out, ""Marry me?"" 

He smiled and replied, ""Okay. On a Sunday?"" 

And I was like, ""Yeah, let's do it on a Sunday."" 

A month later, we were in bed cuddling and he asked me, ""Marry me?"" I replied the same way he did. He gave me a ring and that was that.

So in the days leading up to the wedding, we would jokingly whisper ""Suuuunday"" into each other's ears like Gollum would say ""precious"". 

We did not get married on a Sunday though, because that's a weird day to get married. lol.

224,"&gt; My friend is someone who would never think to grab random women in a bar, so he just doesn't believe it happens.

I've experienced this with a lot of my male friends.

Because their brain is just screaming ""WHO DOES THAT?!"""

227,"I work teacher's hours and he works evenings/nights, so on days when we both work, we barely see each other for a few minutes before one of us is out the door again. When he gets home (around 2 or 3 am, usually), he sneaks into the bedroom and wakes me up with some cuddles and kisses, and maybe some conversation if I'm not too out of it. He doesn't stay too long before he goes into the next room to decompress by playing video games for a little while.

Next-level grossness: I often appear to be awake during these nighttime conversations, and can even respond to him when he talks to me, but I wake up in the morning with absolutely no recollection of it. Sometimes when that happens, I'm freaked out and even scared--he never came home last night!  So he's started tucking me in with this big dragon plushie: if I wake up and don't remember seeing him but I'm holding the dragon, he's home and he's checked in on me.

Also when either of us leaves, we'll often stand by the door hugging and kissing each other for an excessive amount of time. That's mostly my fault: my brain tortures me with ""what if a DISASTER happens and this is the last time you hug/kiss/see him?!?! Better make sure it's perfect!!!!"""

235,"Depends on what it is. I'll try to explain: Maybe I would like my SO to occasionally surprise me with small gifts. The main point isn't that I want chocolate (although I do want chocolate), the surprise gift is more like a symbol of ""I think about you when you're not around"" and the point is that I didn't ask him him to buy the gift, he thought of it all by himself because it's a small thing that'll make me happy. Me asking him to buy me chocolate doesn't do anything for me, I mean I can buy myself chocolate, it's more what the gift represents, the fact that he'll try to make my day better even when I haven't explicitly asked him to.

238,"Weirdly, it's just because I always wear dresses. I slip on a simple dress, and usually some sort of matching shoe or hair bow, and people think I look put together. But it takes me five minutes. I literally give myself fifteen minutes between rolling out of bed and leaving the house for work."
239,"When I say no. I am not saying ""convince me"", I am not saying "" maybe"", I am giving you a hard no. And I would like this to be accepted. No matter if this is about not drinking, not eating lettuce, not wanting to have sex with you, or actually: anyone. "
240,"I generally follow the 5-by-5 rule. If it won't matter in five years why spend more than five minutes upset about it. And if that doesn't work and I find myself thinking more with my heart than my head, I try to make myself think about it logically. Like ""did this person really say that to upset me specifically? Or could something else be the reason?"". It tends to help. "
241,I think this is the real issue. They weren't just posting offensive memes. They were posting offensive memes in a Facebook group with Harvard in the group title. They were directly associating the offensive content with Harvard's brand.
242,"I worked at a jewelry store, I really wanted him to buy me a piece of jewelry (not an expensive one!) just so I could have something to wear every day and think of him. Didn't want to ask for it because it just felt greedy and materialistic. I silently yearned for a year or two. Finally one day he was talking about one of our friends buying jewelry for his girlfriend as a gift and just asked, ""Would you like it if I bought you jewelry? I've always avoided it because I thought you might think it was cliche and low-effort because of your job."" I jumped at the chance to say no! It wasn't cliche at all! And now every year on my birthday I get a reasonably-priced and carefully chosen piece of jewelry. I'm glad he eventually asked on his own because I think I would have just felt guilty if I'd given in and mentioned what I wanted."
243,"I work in a library doing circulation. There are several misconceptions:

- that all people working in the library are librarians. Librarians have MLIS degrees, and most of the people you encounter in a library are just regular staff, not librarians. That doesn't mean we aren't knowledgeable, but we don't have the same responsibilities as a librarian.

- That all we do is read all the time. Nope, we are usually helping patrons with account problems and questions, working on processing deliveries of books, or doing other types of tasks. Working public service in the library is very similar to working any other public service job where you interact with people all day.

- that libraries are places of total silence. We encourage collaboration and engagement. While we appreciate you keeping the volume down for people who are studying, etc, it is totally okay to talk in the library!

- that the people working in the library are mean and unapproachable. I see a lot of stories on /r/books about how people hate using libraries because they had a bad experience years ago with fines, a lost book as a kid and were shamed for it, etc. Libraries have changed a lot in that time and many are focusing on providing great customer service. If you have a question or problem with your account, it never hurts to ask about it. We want you to use the library and we're almost always able to work something out."

And then I leave by 8:00. Even though it's usually less than 40 minutes, I like to get places early or stop for coffee. If I were to leave late, I'd have to rush, and I'd show up just as disheveled. :| So that's why it's part of my morning routine. "
246,"I like to secretly slip a hand under his butt JUST as he's about to sit down, I always get a laboured sigh, it's fantastic"
247,"And maybe it's just me, but if you are going to be a racist/sexist/___ist asshat on social media, at least be smart enough to use privacy controls on that shit! I'm glad that these kids are seeing consequences for their shitty actions, but I'm also sad that people capable of people getting into Harvard aren't smart enough to limit their social faux pas to a group who might agree.

Then again, I didn't read any actual stories about this and don't know if they were identified by screenshots (which seems slightly dubious because that's easy to fake) or by public posts. If the latter, I just think they're doubly dumb."
248,"The pain, for sure. 

I can handle it, but ever since I got my beloved IUD it can get bad. I doubled over in the library yesterday and got some weird looks. Sometimes it makes it hard to focus in class, too. It's not unmanageable, but I'd love to be able to go back to the occasional, barely-there pain I used to have!"

It's not because you told him to; it's because he genuinely wants to do something that would put a smile on your face, and you just told him what that thing was. 

I know my SO loves sour Jelly Bellys, so every so often when I'm at the local convenience store before heading home from work, I'll grab a bag if I see them. Same thing."
252,"That there's an epidemic of fat women who feel entitled to date super hot male models. 

I'm plus sized myself, and I've never really seen this. I've seen bigger women hit on and pine for conventionally attractive guys, sure, but I've never met any who felt entitled to a date or anything. If anything a lot of us expect to get turned down by everyone. I don't doubt that there are women who are entitled like this out there, but you'd think every other fat woman was like this if you followed some sub reddits. "
253,"Why should she have to ask though? Men, you're adults. You should be cleaning your house. It's your job. Just like cleaning my house is my job. It's everyone's fucking job.

The next time you see dishes in the sink, remember, if you were single and living alone, you'd have to do them. Having an SO doesn't change that, it just halves the work load."
254,A washerdryer. Why do I need TWO MACHINES to do it? 
255,"I learned by experience it's a bad idea to say this or that preference/opinion of some men is unhealthy on male-dominated subs. Like on a thread where a lot of guys say they'd have sex with an 18-year-old girl even if they were in their 40s or older themselves you can say ""You are literally talking about a *teen*ager"", they will go ""She's legally an adult!"" and talk down on you, couple guys will support you and the others will attack him too."
256,That is reasonable. I've never understood directing the rage at the random woman.
257,"My stepmom used to do that. I remember her grabbing my arm once- I don't remember the fight that preceded it- and telling me ""you are NOT the only woman in your dad's life anymore."" I think I was 11?

I got down on one knee, started bawling my eyes out, grabbed his hand and asked him to marry me. He said yes!! We're getting married this October. He had no idea it was coming. He did say he was planning to propose to me but was very happy either way. I didn't get a ring for him and I didn't want an engagement ring either. We're just doing bands at our wedding. :)

Prepare the house: tidy, shine all the mirrors, make the bed with a top sheet and store the extra pillows, vacuum the rug, change the rabbit litter box, scrub the toilet and the shower, lock up any meds with my name on the label, put out fresh towels and face cloths, wipe down the counter and tables and such, make sure there are three sizes of condoms and lube is stocked, all the toys have been washed, febreeze everything, turn the phones to Do Not Disturb, put on music. 

Prepare the bod: hit the number two, shower, shave everything, product in hair, brush the teeth gently, mouthwash, drink lots of water, tweeze things, lotion, make up, lingerie (or outfit as requested). 

If I do this whole dance, I'd better make at least $600 that day (about two hours of appointments). 

Edit: Had a couple private questions that I'll answer here. 

After a session: Count cash, log the session (I have a coding system on paper for keeping track of who I saw so I can reference people's notes before they visit) and earnings along with any receipts (wine or food) for taxes, pull the sheets and pillow cases and replace for the next appointment, wash toys as necessary, quick bottom rinse in the tub, get dressed, mouthwash, check the email/texts for next date confirmations or advertise to find more work, retouch make up, don't think about Groundhog Day, and back to work. 

Yes, my friends and family know what I do and it doesn't bother them. I served my time in salaried positions and I'm not keen on it, and this way I can finish paying off my student loans faster.  Yes, I like my job.  No, I don't think anyone could do it. My job requires attention to detail, skills in bed (remember, people are going to publish reviews of your work online, so you better have some idea of what your doing), serious and unwaivering self-esteem, security protocols, intuition, charisma, a vagina helps (but isn't necessary), and an ability to laugh at yourself when things go a bit sideways.

266,"As a guy I think it's really weird how much obsessing there is over male virgins but not even a whisper in the mainstream internet about women who have a hard time with all of this.

For unattractive women:

-Try to hit on guys = vicious mockery.

-Wait for guys to hit on them = get laughed at for waiting for prince charming.

-Give up = get laughed at for being crazy cat lady.

-Actually get a bf = possibility of being treated like crap because partner views you as settling/plan b.

And then you get the Nice Guys crying about how girls don't like them when they never ever ever lift a finger to meet girls of below average attractiveness."

They started by announcing that there was a passenger announcement and my step dad turned to me and jokingly said 'I bet it's someone with a bomb!', I replied with 'yeah, of sorts' but I don't think he heard.
Then my mums voice came overhead and his face dropped.
He said yes and we got a free bottle of bubbly!"
278,"It's not uncommon for persecuted communities to ostracize those within their community who ""pass"" (or at least who they think pass).  Bisexual people can choose to be in straight relationships, and are perceived the option to blend in with the majority without completely giving up the possibility of romantic happiness.  Many gay people feel that anyone who has that choice will obviously eventually take it, and that those who are openly identifying as bi are basically taking advantage of whatever small number of benefits come from being different or special (especially in young adulthood).  However, those people will eventually want to blend in and they'll dump their same-sex partners in favor of a more conventional relationship. 

None of this is right, obviously, but it's a theme repeated throughout history.  It's not uncommon for people from poor families to be ostracized from their community once they become rich(er) because they're ""too good"" for their old neighborhood now.  Or for masculine-presenting women to be excluded by more feminine women, or mixed race people to be excluded from non-white/non-majority spaces, etc.  Of course, passing by the definition of the persecuted group doesn't always mean passing by the definition of the non-persecuted group, so these people often end up being excluded from both.

Once we get past that part, a lot of people still seem confused by the fact that I'm not an actual healthcare provider and I don't work in a laboratory developing new drugs. 

I tend to just skip that whole thing and just tell people that I work at the health department, and then 95% of people ask me something about restaurant inspections. I think a lot of people don't realize just how many different things a health department does. "

I think she must have had her wedding gown hanging next to her graduation gown in her closet, because they got married in June when she was 18.) 

In my defense, I was locked down pretty strictly with regard to 'just going out with my friends,' but somehow 'going out on a date with this guy' was No Problem as long as I was back by curfew, so in retrospect that's sort of odd. 

My attitude at the time was 'hey a guy apparently likes me, who knows if that's gonna happen again,' plus choosing between the lesser of two borings, one of the choices could drive and buy beer. Logic, yeah?

Honorable mention to the guy from the local-band-of-modest-repute-at-the-time who was chatting me up and asked where I went to school: when I named my HS and said I was 16, he made an eek face, apologized, and scurried away.

I'm an aircraft maintainer in the Navy and we do not have a lot of female pilots. Especially when I worked on F/A-18s.  Fuck, we don't have a lot of female maintainers. You represent your gender whether you want to or not. If you're a shit bag, ALL women are. But if you're hot shit, you're an inspiration. Which sounds like a lot of pressure, but pressure makes diamonds.

 The first time another women says that you inspired her, or she thought of what you would do in that situation, you'll never doubt what ideas you give people again. 

Who cares if people think stupid things?  Stupid people are going to think stupid things. Forever. Good people will see you as you are. I got an incentive ride in one of my jets, for being good at my job, and it was by far the coolest thing that has ever happened to me. No one thought I got that because I'm a female, or because I'm attractive. And if they did, I couldn't see them from 38,000 feet. You're above that silliness, or can be.

Now that I'm 32, I can't even imagine dating a 19 year old. I also realize, looking back, that he was one of those guys who dated women much younger than himself because they wouldn't realize how much of a train wreck he was.

Well that fucker just shoved it right back in my face. Not only did he finish his bachelor's while working full time, he also got into a great masters program and finished that and is now at a top tier university for his phd.

He's never given me a reason to suspect infidelity.  I know he's had harmless crushes and even a ""work wife"" but that never much bothered me because he always remained devoted to me.  We got to be really good friends with the work wife.   He never stayed out late at night, never hid his phone or emails, never exhibited any ""cheater"" behavior.  If he cheated and I don't know about it, I don't care.  I'm not going to go look for trouble.  I'm not jealous or suspicious by nature.

She did not teach me anything, she held me prisoner pretty much and the only time I could leave my house was when I went to church. She killed a pet cat by drowning it because it was too much trouble. (I guess taking it to a shelter was too much work?) She's a hoarder. She was laid off from her job 4 years ago, hasn't looked since. But when she needs money, she finds a reason as to why I owe her money. I'm 28 and if she sees me in a dress that goes above my knees, she'll try to lift it up, to see if I'm wearing anything underneath and tell me I'm a whore if I don't have shorts on under. When I came back home after leaving my very  abusive ex, I tried to clean the house, despite it being so fucked up by her hoarding that I had to spend about 36 hours total before it was presentable so I could have a friend over, she got pissed off that I was throwing things away and told me that she hated me, and that she wished I would die.

So he would not support my quitting, even though I literally came home crying every day, because I was just ""venting"" and ""jobs are just hard"" (his mom was mostly a SAHM, I have been working since I was 12). 

One of the most validating moments of my life was when the counselor asked me something, I answered X, then she asked my SO what he heard, he answered Y, and she looked all confused and told him, ""okay, I'm not sure how you even got there.""

My biggest issue is kinda the same but kinda the opposite: I ""interpret"" exactly what he says. And he does not have a filter or much finesse with words. So if I show him some awesome new boots and he says, ""aren't you afraid people will laugh at you when you wear those?"" I hear that as ""those boots look stupid and people will mock you and your weird taste."" When what he ACTUALLY meant was ""those boots are more daring than what you usually wear, are you going to be comfortable wearing them in public?""

Now we are much better at clarifying with each other. He had to learn to hear what I was saying and to repeat back his understanding of what I said, and I had to learn to not get immediately offended at what he says until he gets a chance to explain. This has lead to some hilarious conversations, like when I was driving him around to pick up gear for his new job. We were laughing, talking, having a great time, and suddenly he turned to me and said, ""what do you think about getting a divorce?"" And I just laughed and said, ""You're gonna have to back up a few steps because that question came out of nowhere.""

Taxes. We were discussing his new pay so he was wondering if filing as two single people would save us on taxes. 

It's an adventure! lol"
380,"We fall asleep holding hands. One of our cats has picked up on this and now she wants to be right underneath where our hands are, it's goddamn adorable. 

We also use kissy noises as a sort of Marco Polo if we're out shopping, or just want to know where the other is. "
