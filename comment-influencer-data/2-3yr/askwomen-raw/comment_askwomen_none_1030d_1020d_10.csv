0,"I'm gonna hit 2 birds with one stone on this. First I think I want to try and explain why all of this happens.

As a guy with experience in *plenty* of ""alpha male"" style relationships from my career choices, I can say that it *is* joking around and they are *not* intending to hurt one another. It's about the wit of the person making fun, and the willingness to accept ones weakness of the person being made fun of.

It is an act of bonding between people who have established each other's boundaries and are willing to play.

For example. Let's take a group of male friends playing a card game at a table. Male B is bald, Male F is fat, and Male U is ugly.

**A language warning is in order for the sake of this sub's rules**

A conversation like this may occur:

&gt; F: ""3 of a kind, gentlemen. I win!""

&gt; U: ""Damn.""

&gt; B: *jokingly* ""Show us wear you're keeping the extra cards, F.""

&gt; F: ""I don't have extra cards. I can just read B's cards off of the shine from his head.""

&gt; B &amp; U: *laughter*

&gt; B: ""It also give you the advantage so that you don't have to look directly at Medusa-face over there and turn to stone.""

&gt; U &amp; F: *laughter*

&gt; U: ""Yeah, well, me and B never have to worry about women running away screaming when we say hello to them. I turn them to stone, and by the time they see F, they've already fallen into his gravity well.""

&gt; B: *laughter*

&gt; F: ""*sarcastically* Are you trying to say I'm fat? ... NOOOOO! How 'come no one told me about this? How was I supposed to know?!!""

&gt; B: ""Dude! You could have just looked at my forehead!""

&gt; B, F, U: *laughter*

Okay, so that's a pretty typical, and light hearted example, of what I've seen. Let me explain what was happening.

Every human being creates some amount of emotional walls to protect themselves from cruelty and maliciousness. It varies in height and depth. However, these walls are invisible. 

I'm gonna make a bit of an analogy here, but stay with me. Let's pretend you are in a field and in front of you is an invisible wall. You can't see it, but it will stop you if you walk up to it. If you wanted to know where it was without moving, you could toss something at it like a rubber ball. When it bounces, you know where the wall is. If it somehow moved closer to you, the ball bounces back sooner. If you want to break the wall, you'll have to throw something hard, like a brick. If the wall has come down, the ball will never bounce back.

The playful mocking is a form of each man bouncing a ball off of each other's invisible wall. It's well intended, but it also says a lot about the relationship, and how each other is doing. Lobbing a joke at someone is throwing red rubber ball at another person's emotional wall. Each bounce off the wall says that ""I know where your wall is, and I respect your boundary."" It also says, ""I'm not going to throw a brick at it and hurt you."" It creates a bond by establishing everyone's boundaries and respecting them.

If U made his fat joke and F responded: ""Alright guys, that's enough."" It means that the ball bounced back immediately. F's boundaries just changed and are further out (and thus more protective) than they were before. It's not too concerning, but something has changed. Maybe F needs re-assurance later, but at the same time U now knows not to throw any balls too hard at F, lest the ball bounce off and hit him in the face. A new boundary was established, and all parties must recognize, and respect, that.

If U had tried to hurt F, he might have said something like ""At least I'm not a fat cheating *fuck*."" To which F might have responded: ""What the hell, man?"" In this case, U threw a brick at F, and brick's don't bounce back. The action is clear, an intention to hurt, and the relationship is damaged, but the wall is thankfully in tact. Now, something might need to be adjusted between the two because clearly U *isn't* respecting F's boundaries.

But now if F had responded with, ""Yeah..."" that's a whole different problem. That means that the ball just didn't come back because the wall isn't up anymore. Someone broke F's wall and he's left exposed to all the cruelty that the world has to offer. That's bad, and his friends will notice that someone hurt him. If they are good friends they will either drop it and not throw anything his way while he rebuilds, or they'll help rebuild with him.

I can tell you that I've personally had long emotional conversations with men like this and it ends with jokes, comedy, and small insults. The reason is because if you're going to help F rebuild his wall, it's still invisible. You still have to toss a little rubber ball at it to make sure the wall will hold. A wall isn't good enough if it get's knocked down by a rubber ball.

Now, are a lot of women like this, no not really. Some women are, and it's clear when that is the case. They'll be treated like this. Women that aren't comfortable with boundary testing like this, shouldn't be treated like that. A good way to tell when you crossed that line is when a ball bounces off the woman's head and now she's hurt by what was supposed to be a joke. Now you feel like an asshole because she didn't have an invisible emotional wall. Worse, this is a good way to get a brick tossed at your wall if she's one of your guy-friend's girlfriends. That brick gets a little note attached to it that says, ""Don't you do that again or I'm throwing a boulder next time.""

Now, /u/beepoobobeep said something interesting that I feel should also be addressed here.

&gt;No, you're pretending it's ""just joking"" for some kind of asinine masculinity-proving bullshit. This is why you never discuss any of your feelings and problems with your male ""friends"" and dump it all on me and other women in your life.

Now, there are guys that like to throw bricks, and there are some guys that aren't emotionally mature enough to figure out that getting bricks thrown at you isn't worth the relationship. That does happen when people don't pick up on normal social cues or when the guy with the bricks is willfully ignoring it for his own desires to be a deouchbag. Or even as a preemptive measure for his own, probably insecure and shitty, wall. A la: ""Look at me! I throw bricks! Don't toss stuff at me or I'll get really mad and throw even bigger bricks, brah!""

In a situation like that, a guy needs help rebuilding his wall. But rebuilding that wall takes a lot of effort. If he's not getting his friends to help, or he keeps going back to someone who throws bricks at him, he needs to find new friends. I can certainly understand a woman's frustration with helping a dude constantly rebuild a wall that he keeps letting get smashed and unrepaired.

*However*, I've got to say, that if you think your guy friends are coming to you with lots of emotional issues because they are throwing these joking rubber balls at each other (rather than bricks), let me assure you that it's not the half of it.

I know guys whom I've had to talk to that had 9mm's in their mouth, and guys who've been gang raped, and guys who lose their wives, their friends, their kids, and their minds. The phrase ""I need to go home and talk to my wife/girlfriend/mother about this."" has *never* come out of their mouths."" A lot of them have not, would not, and never will tell their romantic or familial female companions about it because it's a burden on them already, and they *don't* want to dump it on someone they love.

It would be like going to a woman who doesn't have a big emotional wall, and backing up, and pouring out a dump truck full of bricks onto her. Why would they do that? You don't even have a wall to protect you! So, as a guy friend, they might come to me and tell me, ""Yeah, I just... I had it in my mouth with the safety off."", it doesn't deter me because I can deflect a lot of those bricks. When they see it doesn't hurt me, they know that they can be more open and get more of the bricks they've been accumulating behind their walls. It's a test to see how much I can be trusted. When they see I'm not phased, they know they can continue.

That being said, if a guy is using you as an emotional dumping ground, he's so far in the wrong that you should definitely drop him or tell him to unfuck himself right quick. But yeah, most guys (again, speaking generally about heterosexual men) don't tell people have their problems, and explicitly *avoid* telling their female romantic partners or family members."
1,"....so what your saying is that we need to build a wall?

Edit: Thanks for the gold! I'll enjoy it, believe me"
2,My friends and I joke a good bit and I absolutely second the ball bouncing analogy. That's perfectly worded. 
3,"A lot of the guys I know seem to love being assholes to each other. I don't get it. They always play it off as joking around or ""just giving someone a hard time"", and it does not seem enjoyable at all. I'd drop a friend right fucking quick if they started ridiculing me in public (or even in private) the way I've seen some of my guy friends talk to and about each other. 

I think it was actually a big problem in my last relationship. My ex was like that with his ""bros"" and would often treat me similarly, which I did not appreciate at all."
4,"I washed all the dishes last night and put them in the rack to dry, and when I went into the kitchen this morning I found out my roommate had put them all back in the sink. I texted her to ask why and she just said ""haha idk.""

What the actual hell."
5,A friend told me he found a wallet and returned it after taking the money out. Someone did that to my mother when I was a kid and took all of our present money. Learned that lesson early in life. Earn your own damn money. 
6,"there's /r/ladybonersgonewild

also I imagine that guys who post on gw would get downvoted by straight men who are outraged at having to see a naked man."
7,"He was obsessed with chicken fingers. Like I'm talking everywhere we went he ordered chicken fingers. Then AFTER we had just had dinner we went to the casino, he asked me how much I thought the chicken fingers were there. I told him I didn't know the going rate for chicken fingers. I have never seen someone laugh so hysterically in my life. But I was so serious, I just stood there looking at him.  "
8,"When I was leaving an abusive marriage, she told me that she was upset with me because I did not have biblical grounds for divorce and that Christian men can't be abusive, so I was at fault or lying. 

Get out of my life. "
9,"1.) He shaved his beard and had an ugly, weak chin underneath. 
2.) He asked me to flat iron his hair ""like Ryan Seacrest"".
3.) He wore an all red (different shades) outfit because he was trying to match. I'm talking hat, shirt, shorts, socks, and shoes. 

These are 3 different dudes. "
10,"Want 2-3 times a week 

Get..2-3 times a year 

I live with my SO. It's awful 


Hi all I wanted to edit my comment really quickly to say I appreciate all of your feedback and love and advice and I will definitely try each one! Also, if you creepy guys could stop spamming my inbox with offers of sex or your creepy questionnaires about what kind of sex I want and how you could satisfy me I would appreciate it."
11,"The amount I want : once or twice a day



The amount I get: none in 18 years"
12,He wants to have sex in a way that causes procreation. That's a hard limit for me. 
13,"I think it's weird that the idea of Skin Care is often a ladies-only topic. If a man goes to r/skincareaddiction with a issue he often prefaces it with ""I'm a dude, but ..."" when that is mostly irrelevant to the topic. Basic skin care should not be '*girly*'. 

We all have this organ, the skin, and we should all be interested in taking good care of it. Simple face wash, moisturizer and sunscreen. Come on guys, don't neglect this most giant and visible of organs. 

Exceptions that *may* be gender specific: Concerns about hair/shaving and the effects that it has on skin. Also, skin issues that may be caused by hormones. "
14,"The majority of his conversations were lines from movies, followed by, ""Do you know what that's from?"" It's like he didn't have an original thought it his head. "
15,"Red flags:

- Lesbians who don't like bi girls (ETA: and bi/pan girls who don't like lesbians or are afraid to be percieved as fully lesbian!)

- Lesbians who can't be friends with straight people or gay men

- Lesbians too focused on the gold star standard

- Lesbians who say they're the 'man' or the 'woman' in the relationship. Especially lesbians who are trying to prove they're so macho that it's like a guy who's overcompensating by acting too 'manly', it's not their natural personality. Obviously it's cool if it's your actual personality. 

- Pillow princesses

- Every ex is a friend, every friend is an ex. It's really notably present in the lesbian community. When I was dating, I tended to stay away from that clusterfuck as it always turned out badly for my best friend

- Isn't out"
16,"Copying and pasting from another comment this week:

I introduced her to a much older man who was a trusted friend of mine whom I thought she would like. We were 22 he was 52, he had two sons our age and just seemed like a nice dude who treated me with respect. She ended up sleeping with him that night, which upset me a little because he was also a colleague of mine and I would have hoped she would just have a conversation with me first. But anyway I got over it pretty fast, not my business etc. 

Anyway, I redirected my anger to him. Told him he should know better and that if he hurt her I'd fucking kill him. Later that night he took me away from our colleagues at large under the guise of apologising and confessed that he was in love with me before slamming me into a wall, pinning me, and assaulting me. I bit him and ran away, biked home in tears, called my friend right away to tell her the whole thing because I was so scared and confused and upset.

She hung up on me. Dated him for months after. Broke up with him for reasons I still don't know, though I have my fears about that. To this day doesn't believe me, or if she does she refuses to acknowledge it.

Anyway, she threw away 15 years of being best friends over a rapist and whenever I see her post things on facebook about standing up for survivors etc it makes me rage. I have no respect for her at all."
17,Was craving a diet coke and was too lazy to walk 10 minutes to the corner shop. Ordered a pizza with a diet coke. Problem solved 
18,"""Hey I just shat in your bed.""

""WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?!?!?!""

""haha idk"""
19,"Oh, god damnit!..."
20,Leggings are like denim. That shits here to stay^^🙏
21,"She took my ex-boyfriend's side in our breakup. He tried to cheat on me multiple times during the relationship. I finally ended things when I moved to a different city, and very shortly after I slept with someone new. She was at the party where I went home with the guy. She said that if I didn't tell my ex, she would.

Somehow him trying to cheat on me within the boundaries of the relationship was okay to her, but me getting some rebound sex after wasting three years of my life was an abomination.

The fun part? The only reason they were friends was because *I* introduced them. "
22,"My 9 year old has zero time for bullshit and calls people out on it. I used to get in so much trouble for not biting my tongue. I just tell him that he can be right without being an asshole.

Like the time they were doing review in math and he took out a book to read. His teacher asked what he was doing. He told her that the lesson was beneath him and to carry on with her job. This got us a parent teacher conference. :/"
23,"He said ""supposably"" and my dog didn't like him. "
24,"I went out on 2 dates with a guy and then noticed he had a vanity license plate on his car and I just couldn't go back out with him after that. And also, awhile back I was casually seeing a guy who I was also friends with on Facebook and I saw that he would regularly ""like"" those ""1 like=1 prayer"" posts and I lost interest after that. Whatev. Judge me. "
25,"I'm thankful that none of the men I associate with whine about how easy it is to be a woman, especially while dating. I'm sick of dudes complaining how simple it is for women to get sex. 


Anyone can get laid if they have no standards. And they vastly overestimate how attractive the average woman looks. 


It's annoying. "
26,"I had to learn the hard way that I need to define boundaries, and stick with them. Making compromises is fine - but ignoring your own no-gos is a step in a direction that doesn't end well.  
  
When the relationship ended, I learned to be more self-confident. I'm not anyone's doormat, I will stand up for myself. I need to voice my concerns and wants, or I'll never get them. "
27,I like my men like I like my books: well-read and bound in leather.
28,"Everyone is still talking about cleanliness and perfumes and lotions, which I'm sure you already know about.

One very important tip is to _maintain a good level of hydration_.  

Eat well.  Drink well.  Maintain good nutrition.  Try to maintain a wide and varied diet. Bad health often leads to bad breath and bad body odor.  "
29,"A friend of mine once told me how much she loves black babies because they remind her of monkeys. We were in public, having lunch, and she didn't have a clue why I reacted so badly."
30,"He got a haircut. He had beautiful curly hair and one day he came to class with a shaved head and my crush on him was gone :/ He was still cute, but my spark of interest disappeared.

Also, another guy traded our desserts at dinner without asking and ate almost all my brownie. Nope! Bye! 



"
31,He owned a denim kimono and wore it out for dinner
32,"My sister said that women who dressed nice when they weren't with their men were asking to be harassed. And goes on to say that our younger sister can't be upset when guys grope her in bars bc she asks for it by dressing sexy. 


And it's your duty as a woman to dress hot when you *are* with your man so you are a trophy and other guys get envious. Idk. Some shit like that. 



I lost what little remaining respect I had for her that day.  My husband had to step in and pull me away. "
33,"He started balding. I know it's a terrible reason, but 19 year old me just couldn't handle being with a guy who was going to be bald in a few years. Now that I'm nearing 30, I couldn't give a shit about baldness. I'm sorry Dave :("
34,"Not a close friend, but more of a group friend. She was dating this guy and got pregnant on purpose behind his back. Turns out, she was cheating on him and the baby daddy is the other guy. She and the bf broke up, and she is a complete asshole to the father. He wants to be involved, do everything he can, even tried to date her so they could be a family. The only thing she is interested in is a child support check, complains about the troubles of being a young single mom, and whines when the father's family gets on her case about seeing the baby. 

I was never particularly close with her, but now I don't even like being around her."
35,Buy a book on kindle because I couldn't be bothered to look for the paper copy I had somewhere in my house...
36,"Most people have to have *some* emotional walls. From what I understand, men in American culture tend to have thicker ones. I personally know this is true for men in ""alpha male"" cultures or environments. Women can definitely have them to, and having some wall is definitely a healthy thing. Just, you know, everything in moderation."
37,my bf smokes more than a pack of cigarettes a day and has cancer in his family.  he's pretty much in denial that one day this will catch up to him.  :(
38,"Sewing. There's a lot of value and power in being able to make your own clothes/make existing clothes fit well, and at the very least it's good know how reattach buttons and stitch up open seams."
39,"knitting/crocheting. i remember reading that it was primarily men who crocheted early on when it became a thing (tying things in knots to make things = HARDCORE)

it's so ridiculously relaxing and you don't even have to make frilly crap. i pretty exclusively focus on making reuseable bandages for charity, which is dead simple and plain colored. "
40,"When I was in the deepest part of my WoW days I had a mini fridge and microwave next to my desk. 

To take it up another notch of lazy. I was using the microwave and I couldn't reach the back if it finished there. So instead of leaning over more I turned it back on so the tray would rotate back to the front so I could grab that sweet, sweet, hot pocket."
41,"I just found out I have a cyst in my brain and that's why I'm seeing double and having daily migraines.  It's not great news.  I have two small children who don't understand why mommy is always grumpy and it's not fair.  

And my in-laws who hate me and stress my husband and me out are coming tomorrow.  It will be a miracle if I don't fucking cuss them out at some point.  If they try and give food to our two month old baby I will slap someone."
42,"One of my old friends is an alcoholic. We've tried to talk to her about it many times, and so has her family, and she just doesn't get it.

Same woman is also confused as to how she's ""mysteriously"" gained so much weight in the past 8 years when her twin sister hasn't and they eat the same stuff. It doesn't take long around them to see that she eats twice as much as her sister on top of drinking about 10x as much. We've tried to explain to her - gently - about calories in alcohol and such but she just refuses to acknowledge the problem."
43,"I once dated this guy who said ""as well"" instead of ""too"". Which wouldn't have bothered me except he ALWAYS said ""as well"" and he NEVER said ""too"""
44,"My mom thinks my/sibs' OCD came out of nowhere.


I say this as I'm watching her pace the room like a caged tiger, unable to stop rearranging random clutter and clearing up plates out from under someone who is still eating."
45,"He told me to go get him a beer. Now, I don't mind being asked politely, but you're not going to be ordering me to do shit."
46,"I'm just not interested in the idea of sleeping with another man or woman while he watches. It's something he's mentioned as a fantasy, and I just can't get into it. I feel like it's a slippery slope (for me personally), and sex for me is strongly connected to my emotions. When I'm with a person, I don't really find myself sexually attracted to other people anyway."
47,Thank you for the graphic fives. She looked in the mirror and said she looks like the pointy headed Jedi now.
48,"Not my current SO, but my ex was really into pegging. I tried it about 3 times, but every event ended in poop. Poop. Everywhere. Is that what is supposed to happen every time? Do other women here do that and experience an overload of doo doo?

After the third time, I knew I couldn't handle the smell... the sight of it. I wanted to please him, because I knew how much he loved it, but I nearly threw up every time... and actual shit is a mood killer for me. 

Here's a nice ending I'll leave you with: ex-SO had a bit of a drinking problem, and one morning he woke me up after he'd been up drinking all night. He slurred, ""Can you get this dildo out of my ass? I lost it."" I was perturbed, to say the least, and just grossed the fuck out. I put on kitchen dishwashing gloves and went in almost wrist deep... and there was no dildo. There was lots of SHIT... but no dildo. He had to go to the hospital to get it removed.  

I was done with it. Done with the shit, done with the ass play... just done. I can still smell it. Ugh. "
49,"Finding a bill on the ground and keeping it okay there's not much of a way to get it back to its owner. 

Find a wallet with ID and still taking the cash, it's gonna be pretty obvious when you return it that you took the cash. And as a side note if someone returned my wallet with cash in tact depending on how much was in it they'd get a tip and possibly all of it for being honest. "
50,I get the feeling you're 18?
51,Sounds like you have PTSD. Post traumatic shit disorder

53,"Here in college, I was the only guy in an early morning yoga class. I got a weird (even hostile?) vibe from everyone so I always showed up early to get the spot in the front so no one felt like I was there to stare at people.

Its really uncomfortable being the only dude in a yoga class. I don't blame guys for not showing up. The pressure of constantly keeping my eyes lowered was exhausting. Pretty sure the instructor felt for me and she was super nice and used to talk to me. But the entire thing got too uncomfortable and I quit."
54,Don't.
55,"I didn't know what my ""cat type"" was until I got cats: Old Cats.

3 years ago I was on craigslist looking for a dog, I came across an ad for two cats and I saw the ad was almost a month old.  The lady had to get rid of them because her newborn was allergic and the cats were currently stuck in one room in her basement to contain the allergens.  The ad said the two cats were free and they were offering a shitload of cat stuff with them.  Most free cats gets snatched up pretty quick on Craigslist, so I was curious and emailed the lady selling them and asked her politely why nobody had taken the cats yet.  She then informed me that they were 11 and 13 and that several people had come to see them but didn't want to take old cats.

Well that's when my weak heart took the wheel and I was on my way to pick them up the next day, and fuck did I ever luck out.

As a guy who watches a lot of sports and works out outdoors, when I get home all I want to do is sit down and chill in front of the TV, and old cats are the fucking shit for that lfiestyle.  All they want to do is lay beside me on the couch and get pets.  They're obsessed with me and it makes me feel like a king.  I fucking love those old geezers and I'm all in on having my apartment being their retirement home.  

Old cats ftw."
56,"Sorry. It's a bit of complicated topic. I guess if I could try TL;DR ...

**TL;DR -** Men use ""joking around"" to check on each other's relationship status and respect each other's boundaries. Many men do not share their emotional problems with the important women in their lives out of the risk of hurting/burdening them emotionally."
57,"I was driving him home the morning after the first night we spent together and he was hanging off my arm with both of his arms. While I was driving standard. 

I wish I was kidding but it annoyed the fuck out of me. "
58,"reddit's heavily dominated by straight men who want to see women, i'd wager"
59,"How they express their lack of desire for period sex determines whether I think they're childish. Not wanting to make a mess, not liking blood, or not wanting to perform oral during my period totally makes sense. Telling me it's disgusting, referring to it as ""blow job week"" or acting all squicked out over a totally normal bodily function ... that's childish. 

My SO and I rarely have period sex because it's uncomfortable for me. He doesn't particularly like the mess either, so when we do it's almost always in the shower, which is fine. I'm not going to make him have sex he's uncomfortable with but he's also expressed that discomfort in a totally adult way, so it doesn't bother me at all."
60,"He played in a local band in the next state over as the lead singer. They were an okay band, but he was hot, so girls would basically throw themselves at him. We had been hanging out for a while, but I would always go to see him. He finally came to my place to spend the weekend and met my friends and my brother. It all went really well, my friends got along with him really well, but he would not stop calling himself a ""rockstar"". 

Also, the second day he was there, he wanted to day drink with him and I told him that if we did that, I wasn't going to want to go out that night. He said that was fine, so we did some day drinking. By the time night rolled around, he was bugging me and acting like a fiend, going on about how he needed to go out to a bar, rocking back and forth on the couch, just being overly dramatic. He's ""used to the rockstar life and wasn't used to staying in"", blah blah blah. I couldn't stand it. He FINALLY left the next day and we haven't talked since. 

And I really liked him up until that point. "
61,"Yes. At my college engineering career fairs, I wanted to be considered for field engineering internships so fucking badly. Every damn company rep I spoke to would look me up and down and say something like ""you know you'd have to wear steel toed boots and a hard hat and get dirty sometimes, right? Would you even be willing to do that?"" And every single time I said absolutely, I could see that they didn't believe me and I never got a single interview. Got plenty of interviews for office work though. 

None of my male classmates were ever asked the same questions.

ETA: and considering some of the replies this has gotten, it just goes to highlight another issue that we tend to experience. We share a personal experience, and we get shit like ""well I don't think it happens like that / I've never seen it happen, so ur wrong ok bye."""
62,"Just being a cat. 

I really like cats. 

Meow. "
63,"This thread is honestly the first time I've ever felt alone in this sub. I lack interest almost entirely, it's always been a struggle with partners. I never know how to handle it. 

There's nothing wrong physically, I would say I have a healthy interest in other people/things, get turned on, can get off with other people, etc, but I could never have sex again and be ok."
64,"I told my roommate how uncomfortable I was with her friend because he'd sexually assaulted me when I was drunk. Sometime after I'd had that conversation with her, she gave him a tour of our apartment.  Including my bedroom. And proceeded to tell me about how much he'd liked the top floor and my bedroom. 

We are no longer roommates, and no longer friends. "
65,"My boyfriend started a fight with me right before I had to leave for my uncle's funeral. Because he was ""stressed and tired"". I got the most half hearted apology and its pretty clear he felt like he did nothing wrong. And when I got home and started crying I got a very distant ""what's wrong"" and a shoulder Pat. Like he knew what was wrong, and his whole attitude was that I was being difficult or making a big deal. I'm incredibly angry that he feels justified acting like that."

69,"She's 16 now so all the typical teenage angst, wanting to find her identity and be ""different.""  She wears clothes now exactly like me which is hilarious.  Last year she was all frills and monogrammed everything and this year its all hipster fashion.   She's also a hopeless romantic like her fsther and I and now has her first boyfriend.  

She and I grew up almost exact opposites so its hard sometimes to relate to her since by her age I was living on my own.  She is spoiled with love and support and parental time at all times which is far from my teen years.

Having a teen is by far the best part of being a parent.  I love watching her grow into her own person and find her space in this world.  Every day I get so excited to hear about everything in her life and hear her thoughts on the world.  "
70,"I was in the Cost Guard in my early twenties. At the time I thought that I was ""one of the guys"". I was always a tomboy and I had a lot of male friends and didn't think the military would be any different. I had several though situations that I was thrown into, and I don't want to get into specific details. 

I lived and worked on a large ship so it's not like I could not go home at the end of the day, but that's military life. The senior women on board became the allies that I didn't know I needed, and I'm so thankful for them because they protected when I was a naive noobie. So look to the senior ladies for guidance. 

My advice to you is that you always need to be aware that you're in a male dominated  field -- always keep that in the back if your mind. Sometimes it seems like you are connecting with so many people, but try to judge the intent of those relationships . Make friends with the women in your unit and work on those relationships. I met a ton of amazing people from both genders, but I wish that I would have worked on my relationships with the other ladies more. 

My life turned out better due to my service, and I wouldn't change it for the world, but go into it with your eyes open. "
71,Her dog wasn't trained well. She would let it basically bite the shit out of her and anyone who got near the bastard and because it was like 5 lbs she didn't give a shit. She would leave it home in her apartment alone all day. More than once I saw notes taped to her door from her neighbors telling her she's a bad owner. First time she brought the dog to my apartment it shit on my floor. 
72,"My dad is in complete denial that I plan to get married and have children. When I came out as gay, he said he was extremely upset that he'd never get to go to my wedding or have grandchildren. I didn't say anything at the time because I didn't want to spring too much on him in one go. 

But since then I've said I want to get married, have kids - that tons of my lesbian friends have - and it's like I'm talking to a brick wall. He talks to me as if I'm going to be single and alone forever, and that my brother is his only hope of wedding and grandchildren. It's weird. 

I don't think it will sink in until I bring home my fiancee with a ring on our fingers. "
73,"&gt; pillow princess

Usually, a woman who is curious about sex with women but only wants to experience being given oral, she doesn't want to reciprocate. Or just a woman who expects her partner to do everything in bed. I think it's pretty selfish, an immediate no for me. I've known girls who bragged about being a pillow princess. I'm also wary of women who are the opposite of pillow princesses, something a stone butch woman is stereotyped as. Though I guess they could be a match made in heaven, so whatever works for them. It rings bad bells for me personally.

It's a lesbian who's never had sex with men. Some women brag about that, too, or think it's better."
74,"We were on a date at a fun bar. I ordered a beer. Bartender then asked for his order and he responded, ""Oh I don't drink. Just give me a soda with 3 limes."" Okay, a little odd, but whatever. Moving on. So we were chatting, I was drinking my beer, he was enjoying his soda with 3 limes. Then he dug all 3 limes from his glass, popped them in his mouth one at a time like you would a handful of peanuts, and CHEWED THEM UP AND SWALLOWED THEM!? Rinds and all! 

Nope. "

He pretty much ate fast food twice a day because and when he had an actual meal on a plate he wouldn't eat the foods that touched each other. 

This drove me nuts."

79,"Fluffiness, pattern, friendliness, cuddliness. My new kitten is so cuddly I can't even take a shower without him coming into the bathroom, bringing a toy to play with while he waits for me. "
80,"I may be a jerk and people might strongly disagree, but I'll be honest anyway. I ghost. Stop making plans, stop hanging out, taking longer and longer to answer texts untill I don't answer at all. I don't use social media (except for reddit), so that already helps. 

It has never failed. People deserve someone that is as invested in the friendship as they are, and if I'm not as invested they can dump me as a friend whenever they want. 

Some people might say that it's better to have a conversation, but for a friendship I think that's too awkward. For a relationship, yes, always, but for a friendship I find that a little weird. "

Overall it's not all bad. And it's easy to learn to (literally) filter it out. But for a lot of surface users, and a lot of women in women oriented subs (who are therefore targets), the misogyny ranges from sporadic to wearying.

And despite the ""feminazi"" reputation mods here have, I'm probably the most permissive by far. I'm genuinely a super lax person who probably errs on the side of ""rose tinted glasses"" in terms of overall outlook. I'm not a feminist (due to apathy), and I don't feel victimised in any way in my offline life. So the times when ***I*** take notice, it's usually pretty fucking glaring...

**Edit:** An argument can be made that many instances of misogyny are coming from trolls or assholes etc. But it's telling that they're choosing to express their assholery in the form of misogyny. I don't believe for a second that the majority of these people trolling are picking misogyny at random - they're picking it because a lot of them *believe* the shit they're spouting. 

Being a troll and being a misogynist *are not mutually exclusive*. Misogynistic actions by troll *still counts as misogyny*."

Individual subreddits, on the other hand, can be welcoming enclaves. This is one of them, for the most part. If your experience of Reddit is one that mainly consists of hobbyist, self-improvement, or entertainment subs, sure, you're not going to see as much sexism. 

I'd like to know more about your view that ""Reddit is generally very supportive of women."" I don't see it; I see more than a few instances of women being treated as objects of lust and/or hatred, and while there are plenty of male posters who do treat women as fellow human beings, the ones who don't are *loud*...and they are very much in charge.

The military is totally different. You will get screamed at daily in Basic and insults will be hurled your way so get used to it.

Even afterwards, people interact with each other in ways that will force you to either grow a thick skin or quit. A lot of the guys are raised in very traditional Midwest small town cultures and that's all they know, so you may be a little uncomfortable by the way they live and talk if you live in the super progressive cities before joining.

Political correctness is nonexistent in day to day life. For example we are all called ""Airmen"", even the women. Women and men are held to different strict hair standards. People will openly make fun of women being weaker than men. I know some folks here would raise a big stink about gender roles and sexism but that's the way it is.

With all that said, let me emphasize I'm not endorsing outright sexual assault. That is never okay. Luckily the military is taking more steps these days to prevent it."

126,"You're not alone! 

I don't *think* I'm asexual - I like sex, I get turned on, can orgasm relatively easily - but at the same time, sex is pretty low down on my list of priorities. I have sex maybe once a month with my partner, which I enjoy, but I could easily go without forever. 

FWIW, there's a few strategies me &amp; my partner use to get through it, as he's more highly sexed than I am. 

* I have no issue with him masturbating and using porn. Generally I'm not a fan of porn, but I figure it's unfair of me to ask him not to if I'm not delivering in the bedroom as it is. 

* We have rules. He knows that I am very unlikely to initiate sex (and when I do he jumps on it). He also knows that if he tries to initiate, there's a good chance I'll say no. As long as he backs off if I say ""not tonight"", there's no issue with him trying. 

* I keep an open mind. It's not that I force myself to have sex - I don't. But if I'm feeling neutral about it and he's clearly horny, I try to make the default reaction a ""yes"" rather than a ""no"". If we start getting hot &amp; heavy and I decide I don't want it, then I say so and we stop. But most of the time I find that once we get going I enjoy myself. It's like there's an initial barrier in my own head that needs getting over before I'm turned on. 

* We've discussed in-depth the possibility of some form of open relationship so he can get his needs met elsewhere if necessary. It's not (yet) come to that, but it's an ongoing discussion.

Hope that helps, and please feel free to PM me if you want to discuss more/in private. But if nothing else, know this - you're not alone."
127,"&gt; The playful mocking is a form of each man bouncing a ball off of each other's invisible wall. It's well intended, but it also says a lot about the relationship, and how each other is doing. Lobbing a joke at someone is throwing red rubber ball at another person's emotional wall. Each bounce off the wall says that ""I know where your wall is, and I respect your boundary."" It also says, ""I'm not going to throw a brick at it and hurt you."" It creates a bond by establishing everyone's boundaries and respecting them.

Wow, that's a great way to put it. I've used tennis as an analogy before, where male conversations can range from a casual tennis match, a competitive tennis match, and actually trying to hit someone in the head with a brick that you snuck into the tennis court. "

132,"Oh man. I can totally see why you wouldn't want to hang with that person any more, but I'm reluctant to say that she is a bad person because of this. I know that sounds awful, but hear me out:

My boyfriend grew up in the middle east, and came to the US for college when he was 17. He is a wonderful person and I actually want to say one of the least prejudiced people I know. However, there are certain things he doesn't recognize as being racist, and that would be one of them.

As he sees it, a statement like ""Black people are stupid and violent"" is racist, whereas a statement like ""Black people look like gorillas and enjoy fried chicken and grape soda"" would not be. He also doesn't see why blackface is racist. As he sees it, some people look like unflattering things, and saying them to their face is mean, but that doesn't make it racist. He also thinks there is nothing racist about saying black people like grape soda or fried chicken or watermelon, because what is wrong with liking those things? He wouldn't be insulted if someone said he liked those things, so he doesn't think there is anything wrong with it.

Mind you, he doesn't SAY things like that because he never has any reason to, he just doesn't think they are racist. He is so unfamiliar with the cultural and historical context in which these statements are made that he doesn't get why people react badly to them. He insists that they must be taken at face value because that is the way he, being unfamiliar with the context, interprets them.

He is not a bad person though, and he is not a racist. He is just very unfamiliar with the historical context that makes statements like that so bad. I imagine the same might possibly be true of your friend.

139,"Women want men's money.

I don't live in some freaky ghetto and even in the ghettos I am familiar with, women are more likely to work than men.

One pinned me down in an alley and tried to get up my top, until a security guard from the supermarket nearby heard me screaming and stepped in. Another felt me up while we were crashed out, then stalked me for months after, calling me up to 50 times a night. Third one grabbed me and pulled his pants down, and for weeks after would periodically drop by my door in the middle of the night and knock for hours. 

All of this happened after years of being great friends with these guys. They'd all told me they liked me, and I said I only liked them as friends. It's like one day they just snapped.

I brought all the work to the last night again, - tomorrow is my meeting with my supervisor. It's the middle of the night, and I do whatever you name - I watch videos, TV shows, I cook (at night), I clean - anything but studying.  After this I feel so guilty, that I actually cry because I am ashamed of myself. And add sleep deprivation to the mixture, because I cannot go to sleep - I have to study.

159,"I can give you the example of my father, he was an engineer by profession but could do anything and only perfection would do. He could knit, crochet, sew (putting me and my mom to shame - he could take up hems better than us), he made curtains after my mom had given up -try it, it's a nightmare. He cooked anything and my favourite was when we sold our house, he made the ""for sale"" sign for the garden. After selling our house a neighbour asked if the sign was for sale. So he even sold the for sale sign. For his day job he built bridges.      "

161,"I say this a lot, but if you aren't sexually compatible you should look into ending things. It sounds harsh, but sexual incompatibility leads to sadness and unfulfillment. These general lead to adultery or unhappiness in life. It's often better to just stop it at the start.

Obviously, you should continue trying to bring it up first, but at some point you need to accept the difference as too great to overcome."
162,Threesome with my best friend. I don't think I'm able to do it. 
163,"My ex and I were together for about two years before I ended it. I was one of those fiercely independent people who refused to rely on others and would keep all negative feelings to myself, whereas he needed a lot of constant reassurance in everything. My inability to open up and his inability to let go led to me realising it wasn't healthy for us both.

After we split I made a supreme effort to be more open with people and seek help when needed. It lost me some friends who looked to me to be the stoic one, but I'm actually a really emotive person. It was definitely a positive change.

Obviously I have no contact with him any more, but mutual friends tell me it was a catalyst for his own change, too. The funny thing is that our break up led to us becoming the people we would've needed to be to sustain the relationship. I sometimes feel sad because I reckon had we not got together we'd have been amazing friends, but such is life. I have no desire to reach out to him, but I'm glad he's doing well."

166,"I have an extendable paint rolling rod that sits next to my couch so that when my dogs nose open the kitchen door, I can close it again without having to stand up (there's maybe three feet between the loveseat and kitchen door). My SO had an extendable back scratcher that he used to do that, but it wasn't long enough for me to reach the door. Haha. 

I've also used aforementioned back scratcher to scratch the dog because I didn't want to lean across the couch to scratch him with my hand. He didn't seem to mind."

170,"I live in a place where AoC is 13 and the amount of abused girls and boys because of it is TOO DAMN HIGH.

These people act as if the age of consent needs to be lowered because other countries have it low without actually even talking to people from said countries and seeing how it really is. They just want to manipulate and fuck teenage girls.

I've seen friends in my teenage years get pregnant time and time again by their boyfriends in their 30s and 40s, moving in with them, all while being clearly manipulated and abused and only 14-16.

This shit makes my blood boil so much because I'm actually a girl who was anally raped by a man 10 years older at 15 but because AoC is 13 I couldn't do anything about it. He still abuses teen girls to this day and I'm now 21."

175,"I learned that you can't out-talk incompatibility and that love most certainly does not conquer all. If you don't view things in a complementary and, more preferably, similar way... that's gonna be a struggle in the long term.

We met in person because I hoped the phone made it sound weird. Nope. Still has a freaky voice. Sorry dude :/ "
180,"My SO about both the cause and potential solution for his weight gain. He swears it's age or metabolism or any thing under the sun other than food intake as the cause. He also swears the only answer is diet pills or surgery after giving loose attempts at decreasing calories for a few weeks. Most recently he was ""pretty sure [he] has ADD"" because he sees appetite decrease in our son and I on our actually needed ADD meds. 

It's frustrating and given his family history I am very worried about his long term health, but at this point any conversation just makes me want to rip my hair out so I dunno. "

188,"I put everything into my last relationship. I'd do anything to make sure he felt loved. Id bake him cookies all the time, make his favourite meals, tell him I loved him over and over, fulfilled his sexual fantasies that I wasn't into, etc. but after he broke up with me, I realised that I was miserable because he didn't make me feel loved. He didn't listen to the mix CDs I made him. He was late to everything. I can count the number of dates he paid for on one hand (it was almost a 2 year relationship). I communicated very well and told him what upset me, but he never tried to change anything. I learnt that relationships are a two-way street, and no matter how much time, love, and effort you put in, if the other person doesn't do the same, it won't work out. I also learnt that just because you're in love with someone doesn't mean you should always stay with them. I thought my love for him was the only thing that mattered to sustain a relationship, but I was wrong. "

198,"Not OP, but I'm white, and until earlier this year I was in a LTR with a black woman.

I didn't realize a lot of people have such weirdly strong feelings about race, often because *they* don't realize it. I fielded more comments about her race than her height or doctoral candidacy, both of which I felt were way more relevant to who she was as a person. Since the breakup, more people have guessed it was for racial reasons than the very obvious growing distance between us, and I suddenly started hearing friends say the kind of dog-whistle phrases I associate with casual white supremacy; the whole ""I'm just tired of people trying to make me feel bad for being white! I never owned slaves,"" thing - and I know they wouldn't have said it if I was still with my ex. It's not the same situation as OP, but it does open your eyes a bit when people you assumed had the same opinions as you about very basic things take a left turn and expect you to agree because of your race."

My gold star (and a lot of other people secretly,  in my opinion) I'd entirely due to circumstance. "

205,"One time an ex friend told me that he thought women were naturally less creative than men, because ""look at how many more successful male musicians and composers there are out there!"". When I asked him if he thought that could be because women were historically given less opportunity for and encouragement in musical creativity, rather than because our brains are somehow wired to be less creative, he told me that I always make everything about feminism."
206,"Absolutely. Not only that but in very mixed-gender fields sometimes they don't hire a woman because the office is fully male-populated. I have personally overheard or directly told by some employers how they don't hire a woman because they think it will distract the male employees in the office. To be fair though, I've seen the opposite happen, too. Like one guy friend of mine was working as a medical assistant and when he lost his job, he couldn't find the same job somewhere else because all doctors were looking for a woman. Same goes for pharmaceutical sales rep and company receptionist jobs, in my city at least 9 out of 10 times they specifically look for a female employee. Edit: typo"

The recruiter may not openly lie to you, but mine tried to bully me into going open contract. I stood firm and landed a job that I really wanted.

BIGGEST RED FLAG EVER as a bi girl let me tell you.  And being bi doesn't always immediately come up so the girl may still be trying to get with you but will start trash talking other bi girls in general.  That's when it's time to leave.  The whole reason I'm so hesitant with women is because I had a girl throw her phone right at my head when she found out I'd slept with men before after sleeping with her.  Never again.

lesbians who don't like bi girls can be downright hateful."

You know that kind of ""rockstar"" shit. I'm not a prude by any stretch, but he was just using me to peacock and live out his desirable romantic rockstar hunk fantasies.

230,He asked me out on 2 dates. I paid for us both times and he ended both dates by asking me for gas money.
231,"I have admittedly little experience dating women compared to men, but ime the red flags are somewhat similar, so I’ll give a comparison of my experiences with the major ones. These are all generalizations from my experiences dating, I’m not saying that this is how everyone acts, just that this is how I’ve seen these red-flags exhibited when they show up in the people I’ve dated.

* Profession of deep feelings too soon. I’ve found that women are more likely than men to express deep feelings sooner than I’m comfortable with, they tend to look for a more serious relationship sooner. Conversely, men are much less likely to know what they want. I get more mixed signals from men than women by far. I’ve had more men say they want a casual relationship, then get their feelings involved, where women tend to know if they want something serious or not.

* Jealousy, anger, or similar emotional issues. Men are more frequently jealous or have anger issues, while women will be more passive aggressive or need validation. Both are equally unappealing, though the anger issues are much scarier. Men seem to be afraid that you’ll be taken away from them by some “other”; women are afraid that you’ll leave them of your own volition.

* Competitiveness with other people or showing a sense of ownership over me. Men will be more openly jealous, competitive, or territorial than women, though I’ve met women who do that too.

* Poor money management. I haven’t noticed a difference between men and women here. If they’re bad with money it’s usually because they’re parents are.

* Poor relationships with family, friends, or all exs (i.e. “all my exs are b*tches!”). These also don’t seem to have a gender bias, though the way men and women describe people is different. 

The single lesbian-specific red flag I’ve encountered is animosity or distrust towards bisexual women, or towards men. Some lesbians are uncomfortable dating bisexual women, which is fine, but an obvious red flag to me as a bisexual woman."
232,"I did the same but worse.

I saw part of a Harry Potter movie marathon on TV, but they skipped Order of the Phoenix. I own all of the movies. I know exactly where they are in my room. I've seen them all plenty of times. But I ordered Order of the Phoenix on OnDemand to fill the marathon gap.

I paid 6 dollars for 2 days of access, not even a full purchase. Cause I didn't want to get out of bed to watch a movie I've seen a dozen times.

I think /r/frugal would kill me without remorse "
233,*shrug* I don't see what the big deal is. Maybe if men were exposed to male nudity more often they wouldn't lose their minds when it does happen.
234,"No, he's much more vanilla than I am. I'd love it if he randomly busted out with a crazy fantasy though because I'd be up for it. "
235,"I went on a great date with a guy that I met on an online dating app. Later, after some extensive google-stalking, I found that he had lied to me about his last name, and he was actually married with a kid. Some people are so scummy. I hate dating."

It also sounds like he is having some real trouble with empathy. :/"
241,"That's a fair analogy, to be sure.

I think the added benefit of mine, comes in explaining the emotional walls.

It also explains the reaction of women who don't have emotional walls built up. A man lobs a ball at them expecting a wall to be there, it hits them in the head, they woman gets mad, the man who lobbed the ball feels bad but *genuinely* thought there would be a wall, and the woman is left asking ""who the hell just goes around throwing walls at people's heads?!"""

One of my roommates *cut an extra fucking vent into our HVAC, in violation of our lease* to get her bedroom more AC this summer. She literally has the most central, insulated, and best temperature-regulated bedroom in the house, but we all have old-ass drafty windows and she just couldn't handle her room at 78 degrees instead of 74 on afternoons. Please note what she cut into was the main shaft that takes air from the first story up to the attic, where it then distributes to second story rooms through ceiling vents. Now that it's winter, *surprise surprise*, she keeps turning down the fucking heat because her room is too hot."
247,"She's admitted on more than one occasion that she is terrified of any of those things happening to her. I think she copes by believing that god will protect her and that only bad things happen to bad people. I became a different person to her when she learned what happened. While I have sympathy for that insecurity, part of taking care of myself in the aftermath involved distancing myself from those who act the way she does. I struggled to deal with the barbs she slung my way when things were going well, but during times of crisis she is not a good person to have in my life. "

255,"&gt; surely she would/should have seen it as a red flag for herself.

sadly no, one of the reasons she probably so adamantly denied the assault was because it would mean the guy she was idealizing was a rapist.

the even sadder (and probably most likely) possibility is that she thought it was consensual and OP was making up a sob story to ''backpedal'' on her clear plan to steal the dude for herself :( even mothers accuse their own daughter of seducing her father rather than face the reality."
256,"Yeah..my friend is white, working-to-middle class, college educated and British. IMO she has no excuse for not understanding why this is a bad thing to say.

Not understanding why something is racist doesn't make it not racist for saying it. Even if you don't actually hate black people, casual racism like this is what keeps full on hate going."

267,"You know, I want to say ""I run away immediately"" but the truth is, I don't.  There are a lot of ways that people can be deliberately cruel that don't register as ""Oh shit gtfo"".  Often, they're so minor that people will look at you like you're crazy if you're like ""Yeah, I don't talk to her anymore because she said she played a prank on her coworker.""

But I notice.  When someone brags about some witty zinger they yelled at a stranger who made them mad, or how they tricked someone into doing something for them, I notice that that they are taking pride in deliberately taking actions that hurt others.  And if that's a pattern, I don't get close to those people."
268,"I think it's probably a little like seeing the number ""42."" If that number isn't significant to you in any way, you don't take any particular note of it. If you're a Douglas Adams fan, it resonates; it's something that is familiar to you. 

Sexism against women is all too familiar to many of us. It matters for us to pay attention to it, to be highly sensitive to it in fact, because it's a warning: ""This man might be dangerous."" Obviously, a Reddit troll won't be hiding under my bed to grab my ankles when I go to sleep, but most of us have very sensitive antennae when it comes to threats, and that carries over in an online context too. 

Thank you for listening to your friends and looking for more knowledge. You'll see ""42"" a lot more often, I suspect, when you're aware it's there.

270,"Men also primarily knitted too.  It was seen as an advanced craft and there were knitting guilds (like labor unions) in the middle ages.  Knitters had apprentices that learned to make jackets, socks, and felted hats. 

When knitting machines were created, that is where the knitting decline started for men.

But anyway, I would recommend men take up either knitting or crochet!!  If you have anxiety, it is a repetitive task that can get you in the same mind state as yoga.  "
271,"I wish we could get over the social stigma that comes with using them. Sometimes they're necessary, especially in a hectic place like the mall or an amusement park. Little kids are not independent and aren't allowed to make their own choices, so I don't know why we pretend that physically restricting them is some horrible degrading thing. We already do it with seatbelts, high chairs, play pens and cribs.  "
272,"While out for a 30th birthday (read:drunk all day) I was on a patio with some girlfriends. We've all known each other since we were small. A trans woman walked past and one of my friends drunkenly pointed and YELLED ""that's a man!!"" I snapped at her to not be a jackass and she honestly didn't see anything wrong with literal bullying. She just kept saying ""well that's my opinion"" (do you need to announce your ""opinion"" on somebody's gender?!) and I was too mad and drunk to back down. The birthday girl ended up telling us to stop fighting. It still makes my blood boil. "

277,"My (former) best friend is in denial about his Ketamine addiction. I say former because the drug has completely taken over his life. His memory is deteriorating, his urological and cognitive functions are clearly diminished, he can't keep a job and is now on government EI and puts it all towards the drug, then takes out a payday loan on his next cheque and does it again. And yet he still thinks he is in control, refuses to seek help or admit it's an addiction, refuses to even consider it may be linked to depression and perhaps a few other mental health disorders."

If it's starting to look REAL rough after a few days, then I'll pull it up into a poof on top of my head, or I'll wear a pretty headband. However, if I'm going somewhere where there's more expectations of my hair, I like to opt for halo braids (the style where it looks like a single braid wrapped around your head). Also box braids, Senegalese twists, faux locs - protective styling in general is the bomb. My hair is pretty easy though since it's short and cut into a tapered fro, so when the curls are defined and purdy it tends to style itself. 

Little side rant: I think it's so unfair that natural hair is seen as unprofessional. It's my HAIR. Like...I know my hair can get crazy if I get lazy for a few days, but even when it's freshly done I sometimes still feel pressured to straighten it because of the looks &amp; comments I get. :/"

I've had a couple of excellent therapists who are working to get me back on track, and I'm coming to terms with my Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I highly recommend it. 

I'm also reading my way through *The Mindful Way Through Anxiety*, and holy cow is it helpful. Life changing book; it's showing me how my issues are related to my values, and how I can keep track of my daily activity and come to terms with past failures.  Mindfulness is a big deal to me and I try to practice every day. I use these UCLA Guided tapes: http://marc.ucla.edu/mindful-meditations

If you have a few minutes to meditate, holy hell it is worth it. 

My thing has been making sure I can keep an honest accounting of what I've done; often it's not as bad as I think due to unforeseen setbacks. 

I recommend being honest with your advisor about your feelings if you think he or she will respond well; I've had good results from that.

309,"At a videogame society at university I was directed to the Wii room, I guess because I was female and Asian. I love Nintendo as much as anyone but I was there to play CoD. I went to the CoD room and the guys playing would pay a game, pass their controllers to the next person, play a game etc. The controller kept getting passed over me. There were like 3 people who came in after me (all guys) who got a controller before me. Eventually I piped up and asked at the end of a game and the guy who handed me a controller asked me, ""Do you know the controls?"" It was so patronising, no one else was asked that. Then I played and I was trying to join into the banter, getting kills etc. but it really felt like everyone was ignoring me. 

I left after a game and went to the PC room where people were playing League, DOTA, CS...again got asked if I was looking for the Wii room. Someone else asked if I was looking for someone. 

I was done with the society after that. I've never felt so patronised and irrelevant."

They get offended about one certain woman saying she doesn't like one certain thing about guys, and flood the sub insulting or contradicting us. The presumption, narcissism, egocentrism, bullying and mansplaining reaches new heights depending on subject or Sub.

They can call women every piece of shit in the book, talk about rape farms, and how we should bow down, but who the fuck are we to say, ""Don't hit on me while I'm pumping gas"" How dare we turn down a man. How he suffers because men must initiate--blah, blah, bullshit."

330,"&gt;I do believe and internalize everything people say about me if there are supporting facts though. That's not a choice for me however, I truly believe the negative things people say because of the evidence supporting their argument. 

I know where you're coming from with that, and it is a choice. You just might be seeing only the negative evidence. You could be bias against yourself. You're choosing to let it effect you, but you might not need it to. I'll get to that in a second.

&gt;For example, my life is a burden upon the human race; there are dozens of facts supporting that. 

I disagree. You haven't burdened me at all.

&gt; If someone says I have a right to live, I need to know why. They never have an answer other than ""Because you're human."" Or similar, which isn't answer.

No, it's an answer. All human beings, by definition, have the right to live because all human beings have potential for a great deal of good in our society.

&gt;I am unable to simply choose to not accept a comment. There is no defense. Saying aloud or in my mind that it's not true makes me more upset. I do believe it. 17 years of therapy has done nothing to assist in this.

That's because 17 years of therapy can't make you do anything. Therapy can lead you to water, but only you can drink. And you can choose not to accept a comment, you do based on evidence already. The difference is that you're choosing to look at evidence in a certain way, and I'll get to that.

&gt;So if I was fat; someone telling me I'm fat would hurt because it's true, it's negative, and there are no redeeming qualities that outweigh the comment. Nobody can say anything positive about me without making it up, saying it only to try to make me feel better, or to relieve their own guilt from previously hurting me so badly. Typically all three.

First of all, why is it a negative? In the words of my friend F, so what? Yeah, that's his weight, his eyes are also blue. This is a statement of fact, but it's not an indictment. Why should F let it hurt him?

Second, there are *plenty* of redeeming qualities that outweigh the comment. Churchill was fat. I fail to see how fatness is an indictment of Winston Churchill, and there are *plenty* of positive attributes that are more important than him being fat. Like saving the free world. For my friend F, he is incredibly loyal, kind, and generous. Those are all more important than fatness. I do not say that to make him feel better, it is what I have seen for myself. Which leads us to part 3...

Thirdly, I doubt that you are a human being without redeeming qualities. I've already found one, inquisitiveness. I suspect that although you believe you are looking for validity, your perspective may be badly skewed. I would argue that you are *not* internalizing what people say as facts, and that you are dismissing some with pre-conceived notions in your own mind. These 'redeeming qualities' are inherently subjective. To claim that you have none, as an objective stance, is impossible. Someone, will assign you a redeeming quality that they believe to be true from their experience. You say you are dismissing it because it is objectively untrue, but that's impossible for you to prove. If I say an apple is sweet, and you say apples are objectively not sweet, you can't *objectively* prove that because sweetness is subjective to an individual person's taste. It is sweet *to them*. 

Now, let me run with this. The same can said for things that are ""spicy"". We can objectively, and quantitatively measure how hot something is by assigning it units (Scoevilles). What people find to be ""spicy"" varies on that scale because it is subjective. When we say something that is 1,000 Scoevilles is ""not spicy"", we don't mean it objectively, we mean it subjectively. We are really saying that something that is 1,000 Scoevilles is *probably* not spicy *to you*.

I suspect that what you've done, is created a scale for yourself, and defined your behavior along that scale. But instead of saying your behavior is *probably not redeeming to others*, you've simply declared it to be not redeeming altogether. Yet, I suspect others, like myself, have assigned you behaviors that *they* consider redeeming that you are rejecting out of hand. If you wanted to be truly objective, you would have to accept that these subjective beliefs are as legitimate as the negative comments you've been already internalizing.

I would even argue that it's not that you don't have walls. It's that you have walls to target the wrong things. You're walls block compliments, but let in insults and those are the only things you internalize.

Furthermore, I would say that from my own experience, this did not happen by accident. This was done on purpose by people who intended to hurt you, and get you to hurt yourself. No one naturally builds walls like this on their own. The ones you had protecting you from criticism were torn down, and the ones that were protecting you from compliments were built up. Which means that you are doing this because you have been trained to allow people to hurt you.

I would encourage you to consider that your actions are not meant to be your own. That someone has used you and manipulated your boundaries in order to hurt you. And that it is in your best interests to reject that. I suspect your perception is flawed, and if you choose to change it, you will see progress.

341,"If I were to guess, a combo of things. At their core, most of those careers are sales first, finance second. If there's anything that will build up a thick skin fast its spending 8-12 hours a day being rejected more often than not. These careers usually have a commission element if not fully commission. You don't keep going after someone yells and throws every cruel thing they can think of at you, you don't make money, you don't eat. Your tolerance gets high because it simply must to stay in that type of career. Most employers are also fond of publishing week or month end results, so there's a period where you can see where you fall not only next to your friend and coworker, but also some person you've never met in a different state, in an office with different traffic and different socioeconomic status. 

If you didn't have walls when you started, you build them or you leave because those jobs would all crush someone with no walls. They are high stress, long hours and the back and forth soft bounces with coworkers are almost a stress relief in a way. Clients or prospective clients will throw bricks all day because they have no obligation to your boundary. The soft bounces are reassuring. Someone knows where my line is and I know where theirs is and we can play, but there won't be bricks. 

In the same way, I've learned to find it reassuring in friendships and relationships as well. We can joke and it's fun, but I can trust you not to throw the brick and you can trust that I won't either. And if an accidental brick goes, I can trust that you give a shit when that brick never gets thrown again while still maintaining the bounces. "

I learned to be comfortable on my own, and found things i enjoy and did things i wanted to do. I became happier, and more confident.

352,"""bad"" is an odd way to phrase it.

No one can easily judge whether or not how a person deals with emotions is *wrong*, unless they are *suffering*. If you live life comfortably as you are, and your friends are all still good friends and know not to throw balls at you, then everything is fine. If this kind of situation is making you suffer, then perhaps building a wall might be a good idea.

The reason we build a wall in the first place is so that we don't automatically internalize everything that's said about us. If you're psyche was determined by everyone who ever told you, ""You're fat"", ""you're stupid"", ""you're smart"", ""you're strong"", you would probably be a mess, bouncing from one extreme of emotions to another. So, we build walls to keep stuff out, and to stabilize us from the inside.

And it's not just that your walls are always appropriate. Sometimes they need to be bigger, further out, smaller, or closer in. It's never clear which way is best, just which way is good enough for you right now in your current life situation.

Personally, I have larger and thicker walls. People still go over them, but I like having enough of a wall so that I don't internalize everything that gets said to me. If I reject things that are said to me, still take them into consideration, but don't let them hurt me, then this is the foundations of being confident, and confidence does play an important part in achieving a better life for myself. 

So, the real question here is: do you want to be the type of person who lets those things bounce off your walls? If yes, then perhaps you should start building a stronger wall. The first couple times someone says it. Take the hit, and realize it doesn't hurt you because you know who you are and you don't have to internalize that. This gives you confidence, and then playfully lob a soft joke back. If you don't want to be like this, then you're fine with the way you are, as long as everyone understands where your boundaries are.

The only exception I would say is about your social or political agendas (to a degree). If someone would like to challenge those, you should allow for a healthy conversation. A healthy conversation or debate about your social or political agendas will allow you to find weak points in your own beliefs. It allows you to be more open to finding better solutions, changing your beliefs, or even re-enforcing them. It would be like being introspective about your beliefs but having someone there with you to come up with the questions. A healthy conversation about your political or social agendas shouldn't necessarily be about you personally as much as they should be about the agendas "
353,That's called permanent.  
354,"I worked at a restaurant/movie theatre. And I was 16 at the time. It'll make sense later. 

It was pretty late at night (around 9:30) and we were about to close when this older man (probably late 50s) came in and asked if he could buy a chocolate bar. I pull out the one he wants and tell him that it's $2. He ended up only having $1.50, to which I said it's fine I'll pay for the 50 cents. Well apparently being nice to someone means that they can sexually harass me. 

So after I ring him up he starts telling me that I'm really nice and sweet. ""There should be more women like you"" ""women are so rude now a days"" etc. I just smiled and tried to show him that I was busy stocking up. But he just kept going, asking my name, where I lived, how I liked working here. Then he proceeds to tell me that I would really like to meet his ""**son**"". 

""Do you want to meet my son? You'd really like him."" 

I told him that I don't want to meet his son because well, for one I don't know anything about him and two, I just didn't want to meet him. 

Then he says ""He's tall, and handsome just like me."" 

I tell him that just because you say that would not change my mind. Then he said (and I quote) 

*""Doesn't the mystery of it all turn you on? Girls love that shit.""*

My dad swooped in like a hawk and got into 10-15 minute argument with the old man telling him my age, and that he's a pervert and that is so inappropriate, to which the man said ""You're just a protective asshole! She's old enough to do whatever she wants!"" 

I swear my dad was so close to punching him but he didn't, and he finally got him out of the building. 

And you want to know something even weirder that my dad told me after? 

**He didn't even have a son.** "
355,"I have the same situation. I have a sex drive like yours and my wife has one like your SO. The lack of sex isn't the problem it's the lack of intimacy. Feeling like your SO doesn't want you, the rejection, the feelings of dejection from the relationship are terrible things. "
356,"I dont think its petty but HE did. He hated cats. I have three of them. I can never not have a cat theyre wonderful companions. I kinda wish I didnt have *three* but I cant get rid of any theyre family &lt;3 he called me crazy for choosing cats over him. Wed been on like two dates lol

My husband loooves my cats btw &lt;3"
357,"All the penises going inside me. 

Sorry. It's true. "
358,"Guys  who text me all the time without having anything interesting to say. And guys who talk about how weird or nerdy they are.

I've been losing interest in a chap I met recently. I was initially excited, as he seemed really interesting and there was heaps of chemistry, but we've been out a few times now and while the sex is great and the physical chemistry is there, my attraction to him as a person is waning a bit.

It is literally because he says dumb shit. He constantly feels the need to say ""Oh I'm so nerdy"" and ""I hope that wasn't too weird!"" ... when he isn't that nerdy or that weird.  I stopped feeling the need to box myself up like that when I was a teenager yet he's nearly thirty and still feels that way. I find that offputting.

I'm also super busy and he isn't in my city yet. He was working here, but isn't moving here for a bit.  And we've only gone out a few times, yet he texts me literally every day despite me telling him I dislike texting and putting my phone on silent during the day. I'm losing interest because he has stopped being interesting and has also started being annoying. 

It's a huge shame because he did seem great, but I can't handle the ""we barely know each other yet I'll text you daily"" thing. We are not together and I am still (theoretically, if not actually) seeing other people; we'll just see how it goes when he moves here. But now maybe we won't because I'm getting sick of him.

"
359,"I take a lot of care of my skin because it's acne prone and I like it to be soft and clear. A couple of my girl friends ask me for advice all the time. They've known me for a year now and just a few days ago I found out that because I know so much about skincare and because I shave my body, they thought I was gay. I was bewildered on how they made the jump from skincare to sexuality.

So, yeah, I'd love to indulge in female dominated hobbies (thinking of learning how to knit soon), but ain't no way I'm telling that to the women in my life."
360,Sometimes I think people pay the devils advocate because they actually think that - but know its socially unacceptable. 
361,"This is true in a lot of professions.  Most home cooks are women, most professional chefs are men.  Most people who use, like, or work in fashion are women, but high end fashion design is dominated by men.  Even high levels of nursing or school administration tend to have far more men in them than you'd expect given the overwhelming dominance of women in those professions in general. "
362,"This is why Canada has a great system.

12 &amp; 13 have 2-year close in age clauses.

14 &amp; 15 have 4 year close in age clauses.

16 for most things. 

18 to participate in porn, sleep with someone in an authority position, etc."
363,"In a strange sort of way, they kind of are, although probably just because it's such an incredibly common fantasy."
364,"dude, i live in painfully white europe where i didn't even see a black person until i was like 12 years old, and even *i* know it's racist to say black babies look like monkeys. the not racist thing would be to say that she loves babies because they look like monkeys.

she knew what she was saying, she just didn't *want* to understand and so she played dumb."
365,"I feel bad for the actors on Bones when they have to do those super obvious Toyota product placements: ""Well, Booth, this car is so technologically advanced it can practically drive itself! And our daughter loves the rear reclining seats!"". I like David Boreanaz and Emily Deschenal, and just kind of feel like they must be internally cringing every time they have to do it."
366,"My 8 year old is the spitting image of me.  He is so impulsive and rarely thinks about how his actions will affect his life.  He has a lot of trouble focusing on task, especially ones that do not interest him.  School is hard!  I am a recovered alcoholic and worry that one day he will go through the same struggles that I have gone through.  He has a lot of trouble controlling his emotions.  I try to lead by example now and we are currently going to a psychologist to help improve his coping mechanisms.  We are learning ""feelings"" vocabulary and practice daily.  Yesterday he was bullied at school and was really sad but it's hard to get him to talk about his emotions most of the time.  If anyone has any good book recommendations for boys this age I'd really appreciate it.  Bedtime reading has become a cherished time for us both and he has recently taken to reading like you wouldn't believe, but I'm always on the lookout for a good book that has some deeper content.  Currently half way through ""Holes"" and we both are loving it!  We find a lot of interesting topics in it that we often can discuss.  Last nights topic was racism and having compassion for your fellow human beings.  So Reddit, any recommendations for books that will help develop emotional growth?"
367,"Yes to moans. Yes to feedback. Some good examples: 

""*You feel so good"" ""You're so tight"" ""Oh god"" ""I can't get enough of you"" ""I want you so badly"" ""I'm going to cum"" ""Cum for me*"" (only if you know her and she's actually going to cum baha) ""*You look so good on top of/underneath/against me"" ""The things I want to do to you"" ""Good girl*""


I could go on but now I'm sad that I'm single haha."
368,And the guys that grope women at bars because they think they're asking for it if they dress sexy.
369,early 2000s nu metal
370,My husband wants to have sex. I'm considering it. ;-)
371,Easiest way is just putting other things and people in your life ahead of that person and then eventually that person isn't as close as they once were.
372,"When I kissed him, his breath almost made me puke. It smelled like literal dog shit."
373,"Not everything we do is meant to impress someone. Competing to me is fun. Even if I lose it's a great motivator in sports, my job and my studies. Some people don't like this altitude but for me and the people I work with it works great.
"
374,Thrown away dishes instead of washing them because I didn't feel like doing it
375,[deleted]
376,"Reddit is a big place.  There is a lot of anti-woman content here, although a lot of it stays in its own area.  Even outside of the worst places though, I see plenty of negative stereotyping, objectifcation, othering, etc.

You can filter out a lot of it though."
377,"&gt; I thought most guys peed on you in the shower, lol.

As a dude, I find this really weird."
378,"Every time a teacher would ask me to do something I didn't feel was pertinent to me (i.e. Roundabout ways to do math, reading a chapter in class that I'd already read at home) I would say, ""To what end?"""
379,My brain cannot even begin to imagine what that looked like. 
380,I'd be more concerned with the fact that Redhaired103 can hear smells
381,He cried in legitimate fear when a can of biscuit dough popped. 
382,A woman can get in-vitro fertilization by a male donor. Pretty much the same as normal conception without all the business
383,"Found out posthumously that a friend of mine had AIDS and didn't tell anyone. Not even the scores of women he had sex with. Nothing happened because he was dead but I still feel shame that I was his friend for over twenty years and never realized what a selfish, low-down, miserable monster he was."
384,You'd love my cat. She's the chattiest cat I've ever met. I swear she thinks she's holding an actual conversation sometimes.
385,That's not something you can live with.
386,"His ex was disgustingly unattractive, IMO &amp; knowing that he slept with her disgusted me. 

"
387,I've brought it up dozens of times in the last 5 years...no changes. :(
388,"&gt;It's like men are allowed to be manly, but women have to be girls forever

this is sad and profound and true"
389,FYI-those are actually better for hair than normal towels (because they're microfiber)
390,I'm really sorry to hear that. I hope something opens up for you soon. 
391,Glitter and tinsel. Those floating glitter cups. Mittens that are attached by a string because I lose them. Beanies with animal ears or two pom poms. Crazy straws. Glam photo shoots for our cat. 
392,"High school teacher. I make $40,000 before taxes, retirement, and so on. I bring home like $1,100 or so every two weeks. 

Teaching is definitely rewarding if you're passionate about it and have an incredible amount of patience. I tend to use up all of my patience at school and can come home and be cranky, so I have to be careful of that. My favorite part about teaching is watching my students develop as people/citizens and taking part in that transformation. 

I would absolutely NOT recommend teaching to anyone whose first choice isn't teaching. You have to want to be around children/teens all day long, and you have to be motivated to work outside of your set hours and think about your job even more than that. You also have to be motivated to keep trying your hardest even when all signs are making you feel like you're failing (a student is a jerk to you, an observation doesn't go as well as you hoped, a new policy changes how your classroom runs, your students don't turn in a project on time, etc).

I would also not recommend teaching to someone who JUST likes kids/teens or JUST likes their content area. You have to be passionate and knowledgeable about them both. 

One of the ways teaching works for me that I didn't expect was how well it fits the part of my personality that 1) likes accomplishing things and 2) loves a challenge. 14 year old wants to be a jerk to my face? Watch how patient I can be, kid. Student can't seem to learn how to use a comma? Bring it on. Grades have to be updated by Monday? Watch this. 

You have to find things that reward you for your job, because it's not often rewarding in an explicit way. You have to savor small victories with your students, and you also have to find something to keep you going when no one is thanking you or acknowledging your hard work. If you find something about teaching that makes it worthwhile to you, then it can be a great job regardless of the stresses. "
393,"People will treat me differently once they realize I have Black family. I get so many questions to field like I'm their personal search engine to spring every ignorant thought they have off of and I'm required to smile and act like they aren't being racist. I most often get people assuming I am Latina or Greek/Southern European. I have also had multiple people think I was Middle Eastern.

I had an acquaintance I knew through a community group when I was a preteen. My mom (who is white) usually picked me up. One day my dad and my grandfather picked me up and this girl had endless questions. They were ridiculous. ""What is it like having family like that?"" Like what exactly? ""Your dad speaks so well! So educated sounding!"" He has a masters degree but thanks for being concerned about my dad's education.

She was relentless and when I told her she was offensive. She was just ""curious"" and I was being mean and unfair to her. Whatever, no. Just no.
"
394,"Haha, I read it I was just making a snarky comment "
395,"Everyone is using numbers and letters to describe their hair type, and I'm a little lost. Is there like a labelled chart of hair types that everyone is referencing?"
396,"I don't even like *getting* head, but it's a matter of principle: if my partner refuse to give head, so do I. "
397,Maybe he had a terrible fear of scurvy.
398,"which is odd I think. Professionally speaking being a cook or a Chef has always very much been a very strong male populated activity.    

I can cook and do cook all my own meals but I dont know that I can really call it a hobby, so maybe thats the difference? "
399,"my friend said guys that get raped are losers and whimps, shouldn't be called men anymore. he knew that i was a victim too in a situation like that, this guy usually has many bad opinion but that one did it for me. cant even look at him the same. were best friends for 12 years "
400,Honestly? If a turkey isn't done right it's fuckin' overrated. And I've had more Thanksgivings where I'm eating turkey and saying *I am eating paper* instead of *omg this is so good*. I'm so much more into sides. and pie. and wine. 
401,"The biggest thing is something you already do: Be aware that women are generally a bit more on edge about walking down a dark, mostly deserted street than men are. Being able to empathize with that and remove some of the anxiety from someone else is thoughtful of you. No one's going to flag you down and say, ""Hey, thanks for not scaring the shit out of me or being a creep!"" so I'll say thank you for that here on this thread. Thank you! :) 

As for other things you can do: 

- If you have a phone, talk on it. Someone who's clearly doing his own thing is reassuring; it means he's not focused on me. 

- Creating a little distance is good. Speeding up to overtake someone can feel at first like speeding up to *catch* someone, which is scary. 

- If you do happen to pass her -- if she's stopped for a minute, for instance -- eye contact, a brief smile, and a nod are fine. Looking busy and not acknowledging her is also fine.
