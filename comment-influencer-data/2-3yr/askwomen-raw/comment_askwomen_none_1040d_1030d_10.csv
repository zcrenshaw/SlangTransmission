0,I'm thrilled this shitshow will be over yet terrified of what will happen. 
1,"He came home with a black eye and told me it had happen at work. He said he had run into something. A week went by and we were at a party when he suddenly wanted to leave. A week after that we ran into one of his friends at the store and he again tried to get us to leave, leaving all our stuff in our basket and running out. Once in the parking lot his friend chased after us and started shouting ""you better tell her you slept with her best friend or I'm going to black out your other eye!"" Lost a friend and a boyfriend that day. "
2,"I go for the classic ""Be as funny as possible in a group and completely ignore the guy I'm into.""

It rarely works."
3,I was blown away that someone I had met maybe two times stood up for me like that. We did end up becoming friends after the fact. 
4,"That I am chanting ""please don't die RBG"" "
5,"To be honest, if I were having sex with Goku I'd *already* be scared because I'd know Chi-chi was on her way to murder me."
6,"The assumption of good will. As in, strangers will assume that I'm safe and friendly until proven otherwise. I imagine if I were a 6 foot muscley guy with resting bitch (bastard?) face the standoffish from others could become saddening."
7,I've seen many times men lamenting that marriage only exists so us women can take half of their crap during a divorce. Because that's every little girl's dream.
8,I hope you're friends with that friend of his... S/he did you a favor chasing him into the parking lot.
9,"I'm a big fan of my vagina. Makes me feel like a kangaroo, I have my own little pocket if I feel the need to hide stuff, like snacks."
10,"I'm fairly confident Clinton will win - but not confident enough. There's some worry that I will wake up on wednesday morning and hear the other one has won...

And I live in Europe.

EDIT Nov 9 8.09AM GMT+1: Well fuck me... Waking up today was not pleasant."
11,"i'm black.....


im serious.....i have heard the ""I would sooo date you if you weren't black"" line often, among others with the same general idea.

it's definitely not something i'd change, lol im bombtastic

Edit: BTW it's fine to have a preference for certain features a race may provide. But if you're saying you won't date me because my superficial qualities prevent you from forming an emotional connection....hmmmmmm"
12,Pants without pockets but still look like they have pockets.
13,"That it is someone's fault. 

Sometimes shit just doesn't work, sometimes people don't mesh, sometimes people grow apart and change, sometimes life isn't fair, and sometimes the only thing you can do is concede with grace, walk away, and move on. 

Placing blame on someone for every situation seems small minded. The universe is complex and sometimes it isn't anyones fault. It's okay to feel about it, but it isn't fair or helpful to be placing blame all the time. You force someone else to be the victim of your inability to process effectively. It's a feedback loops of ugly things and ineffective coping skills.

14,"My dog loves to eat leaves. She goes crazy over them! Any leaf, old leaves, crunchy leaves, brown leaves, leaves still on the tree. Just pick one up and wave it at her and she will get super excited and jump to get it. It's fun watching her run at full speed, spot a leaf, and try to grab it while still running, lol. 

[Picture!](https://i.imgur.com/xx6FliW.jpg)"
15,"I sell my dirty panties to creepy old dudes. Very lucrative, low effort, great return on investment. Socks too. "
16,"Was having an Amazing night out with friends, the group left for another area in the club, I stayed behind and danced and enjoyed the music with some strangers. 

This guy starts dancing beside me, seems friendly at first. Later on he starts touching my neck. I tell him dude stop, that's weird what're you doing. 

He does it again. I get annoyed and tell him more firmly to quit it. 

Suddenly this piece of shit, out of nowhere, grabs my crotch. I was so speechless and enraged. 

In hindsight I wished I dragged him over to the bouncers and have him kicked out, instead I just left to look for my group and dance with them. "
17,"I go to events on SURKUS, which is an app that does crowd casting for events or bars that want the illusion that there's more people there. You make a profile and if you're picked and agree to go, you basically just go dress up, go to cool clubs, drink, and mingle with people, and youre typically compensated with free bottle service, $10- $20, and Uber credits. It's not a ton of money, but you also save money by not paying for drinks when you go out, and it's great if you have friends that are on the app too. I think it's probably only in major cities though (I'm in LA)."
18,"

If you tell me you're going to be in one place, but get sidetracked and end up in a Starbucks or whatever, it's no big deal. Telling me you're at work and I find out it's your day off and you're at your ex's house? We're gonna fight. 

If there's nothing to hide, there's no reason to lie to me. "
19,[deleted]
20,I'm not even American and I'm so fucking glad it's finally over. Finally we can talk about something else again. You seriously need to do something about your election length. I feel liked I haven't read anything but Clinton this and Trump that in the newspaper for about a year. 
21,Only one thing -  my erections  aren't obvious so I don't have to hide them. That's it. 
22,"I'm married now but back in the day it kind of went like this: Make as little eye contact as possible with the object of my crush. Ignore him whenever possible. Pretend I don't even know who he is. If he talks to me, respond with something really awkward. Go home and cry. 

Ninja edit: I have no idea how I ended up married, lol."
23,"SHITTING. Seriously, the guys I work with talk about it all the time. No one wants to know about that one time you took a big dump in a Home Depot. "
24,"I've seen it expressed many times that if a man is single, it's because women are shallow and only want attractive assholes while ignoring the average-looking dude with the world's greatest personality. But if a woman is single, it's because she is shallow, fat, a bitch, a whore, etc."
25,"Lying is a deal breaker, especially about something like that. If you're lying to me about where you are you're probably doing something I won't like. It's a compounding problem that will only get worse. "
26,"My wife cheated on me twice, but she was basically having a mental breakdown and never intended to cheat. 

She was dealing with family tragedy. I was away for work a lot around then and she had no support. So she started drinking to excess and doing a bunch of self-destructive stuff she's never done in her life. 

One night she got drunk and ended up being led back to a guy's hotel room and being coerced into sex. I was away, and came back a few days later but had to leave again the same night. All I noticed was that she was in a completely distraught state. So I cut my next trip short so I could be with her. 

In that time, it happened again. I came back just as she was coming home from that guy's place, and she broke down and told me everything.

So it wasn't the type of cheating where she enjoyed it and wanted to keep it secret. It was the type of cheating that is self-harm and left her feeling like she had violated herself. (We're still together btw, it took me almost no time at all to forgive her.) "
27,"I grew up where we'd have white Christmases every year, and it's one of the things I miss most about home. (I live in California now.) 

The first Christmas my wife and I had after moving in together, she gave me snow! I told her I would have to briefly sneak out on Christmas morning to get something. In the meantime she scheduled this truck to come over that shoots snow out of a hose. It completely filled our back yard. 

When I came back and went looking for her, she was standing out there drawing a heart in it.

Oh, and what I bought back was a rescue kitten! We had fallen in love with her when we both went to visit awhile before, and as my wife was getting the car, I told the shelter we would take her and could I pick her up on Christmas morning. 

And the kitten loved the snow too and we were all very happy! "
28,"They need to be hot, but not too hot, that's intimidating. And while I can appreciate a certain level of cheesiness, I don't want them going overboard. "
29,My little girl dream was to grow up and be a dinosaur.
30,"That women have it so much easier when it comes to getting a date/sex.

There seems to be this incredible disbelief that women actually want to be attracted to, and have a good time with, whomever they sleep with."
31,"People give me more space to be vulnerable and show a range of emotions than they do men. 

It's also more acceptable for me to pamper myself and talk about taking ""me time"". 

Guys need those things too but often are socially punished for it. "
32,  I'm pretty sick of hearing about how a woman's appearance makes a man's penis feel. 
33,"I'm totally jealous of this. A few months back I was sitting outside a coffee shop reading the news, enjoying breakfast and the quietness of a crisp early Saturday morning. A woman walked up with her pug pup, a little tiny guy, not realizing that she couldn't go in and order with the dog. She scans the nearby area, sees me and asks me if I would mind holding him. SCORE!!! She hands him off to me and walks inside. As a 28 y/o bald man I have never been asked/trusted with something like this and it completely made my day. 

I only made 3 facebook posts with the little guy. "
34,"That's awful, no wonder you're angry. I would be too. I understand that feeling of ""in hindsight I wish I'd..."" but you're not at fault here. You told him to stop, and he persisted. It's not surprising that in the moment you were shocked and just wanted to get away, so please don't beat yourself up.

FWIW, it sounds like you actually handled it well. You told him to stop, and when he didn't you put space between yourself and him and went to find your friends so you weren't alone and had a support system to back you up. Very sensible - you did good!"
35,"What I worry about is, somehow the shitstorm continues. "
36,"Girliest answer: being able to dress up, do my makeup and hair, wear cute jewelry, etc."
37,"I play piano and whenever I play Bach or Mozart my kitten gets on my lap. If I play other composers, he leaves, but comes back for Bach and Mozart. I was thinking that he was a super classy and refined animal and secretly felt kind of proud of him. 
Then I played 'Love is Blue' by Liberace and he went fully bonkers, got on my lap, meowed and purred. Maybe he's not so classy..."
38,"Um, really worried. We already have some states with very restrictive abortion laws and we have Republicans controlling the house, senate and executive branch, the VP of which has only run on banning abortion (like literally the only things he did in congress was try to get abortion banned or restricted). If we have conservative judges get into the Supreme Court, there will be no protection for abortion rights."
39,"I've seen a lot of ""if we don't kiss on the first date and have sex by X weeks, I assume they're not attracted to me and consider my other options. If we don't have enough of an emotional connection after X weeks for you to sleep with me, when will you?""

I guess I'm lucky all my partners were willing to wait way more than that. "
40,How they feel the need to tell me they don't like women that wear makeup 
41,"Having my value instantly determined by my attractiveness. If I don't wear makeup or I go out in sweatpants I am treated significantly differently than when I look nice. I would PREFER zero attention, just scan my shit and take my money, but being told to ""cheer up"" or being asked if I'm sick just because I didn't feel like spending 30 minutes getting ready is getting really old."
42,"I am very worried. I posted a thread here asking women how their sex lives would change if abortion were illegal and a lot of people said they'd double up on contraception, get more reliable contraception, get sterilized, avoid PIV sex, etc. I think we are all worried. People on that thread said they would rather die than give birth.

You're going to see a lot of women traveling to blue states to get abortions, a lot of women traveling to Canada to get abortions, etc."
43,wat
44,Those big pieces of tissue that come out when you're on your period. 
45,"I'm exhausted. Even my 7 year old is annoyed at the political commercials. I told her we have one more day and then it'll be over. She said ""Thank god."" lol.

I already voted so we're just going to chill and watch the news tomorrow. I feel a little bit of anxiety because nobody really knows who it's going to be yet. "
46,"Terrified. I've had an abortion before. Had the option not been open to me, I would have tried to do it at home and likely have died. I understand the level of fear and desperation that drives you there. I'm not scared for myself, I'm scared for the millions of women out there. "
47,Trump has promised it will if he loses.  And he has promised to put his opponent in prison if it wins.  He is doing his best to ruin the idea of democracy....
48,"I don't have a seperate drawer for underwear and socks, they're together. "
49,"Yes. I posted this probably a few weeks ago, but the first red flag was that he was close with his ex but also never told me about their previous relationship. It was his friends who brought the truth to my attention. I tried to be cool with it because I know exes can be friends, but the lack of transparency was a huge issue I should have addressed sooner. Then when I would ask questions about her or express concerns based on actual events that were happening (ex. she once crashed at his place for a week straight), he would warn me that I was ""raising red flags"" for him. I felt distant from him, like I couldn't actually open up or be myself around him, and basically realized the relationship was a sham. I'm glad I left sooner rather than later, but damn I wish I had paid attention to the signs even earlier."
50,"That a woman in a bar/club/wherever has her pick of the single guys there.  One, not all women are attractive.  Two, in my experience single guys looking for sex are super picky.  That's not even a criticism, if you're going to be picky that's absolutely the appropriate situation, but it's definitely not true that men will just sleep with any woman who expresses interest (or even any attractive woman that expresses interest).        "
51,"Get enough sleep

Drink more water"
52,"We ""semi eloped"" with our parents in the mountains. After the wedding, the two of us went to our hotel room alone. We turned on the fireplace, lit a candle, put on a playlist we'd brought and had our first dance alone in the dark."
53,"I figured something was up, but wasn't sure. He was very good at lying and covering his tracks.  He worked odd hours at the law enforcement center so if he picked up extra hours here or there I didn't think anything about it. That also meant he was rarely working during the hours I was.  I actually had someone tell on him to me anonymously on Facebook. Confronted him and more lies.  Eventually the shit hit the fan when I was contacted again by someone else that sent me proof.  He had been cheating for years with several different women over the course of our marriage.  Took me a while to pick myself up and realize I didn't deserve that treatment and no one does.   Getting screwed in the head for years takes some time to undo. "
54,"I play a lot of video games. A lot of guys say they like a girl who plays video games... until they see that I'm better than a lot of them. And fuck no, I'm never changing that it's part of who I am, I'm never changing that for a guy. My current bf doesn't mind, in fact he likes t and tries to keep up with where I'm at with that regarding tournaments and leagues and stuff."
55,"Well, no, I wouldn't be scared. But I also wouldn't fuck Son Goku. Or any iteration of Goku because he's the fucking worst.  

Future Trunks or gtfo."
56,I'm childfree and I'll have tubal ligation soon.
57,"Consistent cheese. Right to the edge. None of those, ""I'm only gonna cheese some of the time"" pizzas. "
58,When my partner tells me qualities he likes in a woman that I don't have. 
59,"I was just being sexist, ugh, don't bring me down with your actual facts."
60,Step 1: be pretty :\
61,"step one: stare a lot, especially sideways. peer at him without trying to catch his attention

step two: engage with him in larger social interaction - so in a group of maybe 4-8 people. try to make him laugh/smile at some of my comments; actually make eye contact

step three: side conversation in which i hopefully make him laugh more

step four: ask lots of questions and try to get him to open up more about himself/his interests

step five: hang out one on one, hopefully over drinks or a joint. keep trying to make him laugh forever.

my ""try to make them laugh"" usually isn't in a teasing way. it's either self-deprication (a light level - not quite on a meirl scale) or weird observations or general absurdity."
62,"I have to get up before my boyfriend but I always kiss him and tell him I love him before I leave. The habit came up once in conversation and I told him that I do it because if something happens to one of us during the day, I don't want the last words we said to each other to be something like ""farts,"" which would be possible because we have juvenile senses of humor. When I kissed him the next morning and said, ""I love you,"" he sleepily answered, ""Faaaaaarts."" Now ""farts"" is code for ""I love you."""
63,"Being able to do stuff without judgement. Yea, I want to drink vodka and eat twizzlers and popcorn for dinner while watching 6 hours of chopped. Like an adult. Or just eat a bag of kale for dinner bc I'm too fucking lazy to make a complete meal and I know that requires one pan and I'll be full. Or being able to eff around at the gym from 5 pm to 8 pm and not have to hurry home to make dinner or whatever. Or spend the night at a friend's house without making plans about it, first. But, honestly, being in a relationship helps keep me balanced. I need accountability in my life (see: my choices for dinner)"
64,"Honestly, nothing. There isn't anything I can do."
65,"Pro (men): there's a really clear end point, which is comforting to someone with sexual anxiety (me.) there's a ""script,"" so to speak.  the male orgasm is really exciting and fulfilling for me. I generally crave PiV in a sexual encounter. 

Pro (women): can't get pregnant. there's more of a mutual understanding that things need to be individually tailored. I don't feel self-conscious about my body as much. 

Con (men): risk of pregnancy and STDs goes way up. in a first-time sex situation, I'm way less likely to physically enjoy myself. sometimes I just don't want to deal with a dick going into any orifice. 

Con (women): I sincerely don't know wtf I'm doing, in/due to my limited experience. it feels like I don't have quite as solid of a goal to work towards (some women are satisfied without an orgasm, some aren't satisfied until they've had multiples.) sometimes I crave penetration but have the vague notion that a dildo or strap on would make me feel awkward. "
66,How people can vote for Donald Trump.
67,"The ""friendzone"" and how he's always in there. There's probably a reason for that, mate. 

Or all of his ""crazy"" exes and all the ""totally crazy"" shit they did like have emotions and expect not to be treated like doormats. 

There are definitely some abusive women out there, but 9 times out of 10, when a guy is telling me about his ""crazy"" ex it sounds like she was just a normal girl who wouldn't put up with his shitty behaviour. "
68,"I would not meet up with someone purely based on pictures, and not within an hour of hearing about their existence.
I also wouldn't meet at a bar I had no choice in, the ones closest to me are sketchy as fuck."
69,"Idk why you're getting down voted, this question is hilarious. 

But I wouldn't want anything to do with Goku. Not my type. I'm all about that Vegeta, though. "
70,"I always got the impression Goku had sex exactly two times in his life, was very confused about it both times, probably cried a little the first time, then Chi Chi promised to make it all better with a big dinner and Goku never made the connection between sex and babies because he didn't think to ask. Gohan and Goten just kinda happened in his life and he went along with it because nobody else seemed surprised."
71,"Yep. He kept talking about his colleague, bought himself a load of new clothes and aftershave, started going out with his friends more (or so he said) and didn't want to have sex as often. It was pretty obvious to me that something was up and I suspected he was cheating. It just took him a while to come clean about it. "
72,"We always have a free seat next to us on the subway though, loads of elbow room because people always, always pick another available seat. 6ft RBF male checking in.

Yes I shower daily :D"
73,"Personally I wouldn't be having sex with Goku, he's waaaaaaay too childish. 

I'm all about Vegeta though. I want to be the princess of all Saiyans! 

If Piccolo didn't reproduce agametically I would be all about him but alas :("
74,I'm not usually the praying kind but if there's any hope for us it's that RBG makes it another 4 years. Or like 3 and we'll have a midterm resurgence like the conservatives had for Obama to reclaim congress and block nominations.
75,So you're a Vegetarian?
76,"I do search evaluation with Appen Butler Hill. Basically, it's 20 hours a week helping determine what people were looking for when they search certain words and phrases. Pays well too. I recommend it."
77,"I can only flirt on accident. I can't do it on purpose. My on purpose flirty is stages of awkward, avoidance, and then overly blunt. 

My friendly accidental flirting is open body language, easy laughing, eye contact, my general tendency to fidget with my hair and way too many articles saying this means something, asking open question, being genuinely interested in responses, and casual touching if the other person is doing a similar thing. Also I mirror a lot when I'm trying to be friendly. "
78,"I hear so much complaining about how men are forced to pay for everything and women are expecting $250 dinner dates, a $500,000 house, a $60,000 car, and a $20,000 engagement ring.

If you meet a woman who expects you to pay her way for everything, you do not have to date her. Not to mention that, while I'm sure these women exist, I and most other women I know either go back and forth with who pays, or split the bill every time."
79,[deleted]
80,Yep. The sickness I felt the morning after Brexit will be nothing compared to if I wake up to Trump as POTUS... it's just a terrifying idea.
81,"Not to speak for OP, but stricter abortion limits may make it impossible to choose not to carry a child to term if it has a severely shortened life expectancy or no expected quality of life due to severe developmental issues or if there is a danger in the pregnancy that threatens the mother's life. 

Late stage abortions especially usually deal with fetuses that face so many medical issues that they will never be viable outside of the womb. The idea of being forced to carry a child to term under those circumstances and then watch it die slowly in a hospital can be very traumatic, where a late stage abortion could minimize suffering for both the parents and the child."
82,"I'm actually getting pretty major anxiety about it. My heart rate spikes when I read headlines, my mouth has sort of a copper taste to it, I keep randomly getting shaky. 

I think Clinton will win. What's making me anxious is that even when she does, the problems will stay. 45% or more of this country will have openly and proudly demonstrated their racism, sexism, homophobia, and hateful ignorance. The House and Senate will still be filled with conservative fuckwits who will make the next four years as ineffective as the last eight. The voter suppression and intimidation that had been rampant this election (and has been a part of all elections) will remain. White Nationalism will take this defeat and become louder and potentially violent. The FBI and Fraternal Order of Police will still have shown their ugly underbelly, and yet demand the trust and respect of citizens. There will still be people screeching their uninformed brains about about ""ripping babies from the womb."" I'll still remember this whole fucking thing. 

I hate this. "
83,"This is the correct answer.  

Also acceptable:  This would never happen because Chi-chi would murder me."
84,"I'm sorry this happened to you. Your reaction (or lack thereof) is perfectly normal. 

I'm sorry I have no tips to give on ""dealing with it""... you just kinda do because you have to. I've sometimes gotten rid of pants I was wearing when things happened, so if that's an option for you maybe it would help? If you find it continues to affect you for days you could try talking to someone. They have hotlines and everything."
85,"Yes, let's not forget the next big Congressional election is in 2 years. Time to start organizing!"
86,europe is watching anxiously. you guys living there must be shitting yourselves..
87,Being referred to as a girl when I'm a woman
88,BOOBS! 
89,"My dad is a classic emotional abuser. His favorite thing is to move or hide other people's possessions, mail, etc and insists that they never were there. Second favorite is to scream insults then act confused and hurt when you react in kind. 


I've taken to gaslighting him back by saying how concerning it is how he keeps forgetting things and maybe he should be tested for dementia. "
90,"Absolutely. He would do things like pick up ""shifts"" at work last minute (turned out he was cheating on me with his coworker), drive downtown after I went to bed to give a female friend (that I'd never met) a ride home from the bars because she called him drunk at 2am, then hang out with her at her apartment, etc. I'm not an idiot, I knew something was up but I didn't have proof. He would get angry at me, deny, and gaslight me. Making me feel like I was being irrational.  

My trust in him dropped to zero. I was suspicious, and pretty frequently angry with him. I had extremely high levels of stress and anxiety as well as not being able to sleep properly. When I actually caught him in the act of cheating on me it was one of the best things that could have happened, since I don't know when I would have left otherwise."
91,"That being physically fit will gain you more success in finding relationships with ""worthy"" partners, versus having actual social skills, personality, and independent interests.

Similarly, that dating is formulaic, and if you just follow x procedure or course of action that will net you dating success."
92,Yeah they all think it's cute until they see you play for 14 hours straight lol
93,"Yeah, all while ignoring average-looking women and looking and wanting the model-like ones. It's one of the things I hate the most about reddit's sentiment about relationships too."
94,All expenses paid? Go to San Francisco. There's no end to the cool shit you can do there if someone else is paying. 
95,"I've got a part time retail job. Pats decent ($12/HR), is very good about sticking to my hours available and giving me days off when asked, it's easy and low stress, I get in a lot of walking which is a nice contrast from my more office based day job. 

I'd be worried about Uber type jobs because of the insurance issues and that it puts more wear and tear on your vehicle. "
96,Don't speak to me or my Future Trunks ever again
97,"I feel like this election has really brought out an ugly display of how misinformation has spread into our national political conversation, more than ever before. 

I’ve been in grad school, studying International Relations for the last year and a half. Every semester I have to write papers and back up my assertions and assessments with *evidence.* And I can’t just cite whatever I want, I have to vet my sources. Are they reliable? If their reliability is in question, can I find a second source to confirm? What is their methodology in gathering data? 

And then I’m listening to the radio and they’re interviewing people at a Trump rally. Guy says that Clinton is going to allow Sharia law to spread in the US, like it already has been in Dearborn Michigan. Reporter calls him out on it. “I’ve been to Dearborn, they don’t have Sharia law.” Guy doesn’t believe the reporter. Says he’s “read things” and he *really, truly believes that ISIS has taken over Dearborn and has established Sharia law.* Based on some nosense someone posted on Facebook. 

If I made the statement ""ISIS has taken hold in Dearborn, Michigan, and has implemented sharia law"" in one of my academic papers, I would get an F. There is no empirical evidence that supports such an assertion. 

Trump, and his campaign, *knows* there is no sharia law. But they won’t clarify this, they feed on the falsehoods and lies that are being spread, mostly through fringe wacko websites that people take as gospel truth. Apparently, media like the NY Times and Washington Post are just spreading lies and deceit. Yes, their editorial boards are liberal, but they do truly honestly try to published facts and reality. Alas, it isn’t what people want to hear, so they flock to the wacko clickbait articles and share them on social media and the lies and misinformation spreads. 

I’m also frustrated with the lack of solid vetting and investigation of Clinton. There are real legitimate reasons to criticize her! A good opposition candidate should be able to dissect her policy positions from her past and the many ethically questionable things she has done! Where is that? Do I blame the “mainstream media” for not being more critical of Clinton? Maybe a little, but I truly blame the GOP and Trump for failing to put together a solid *facts based* critique of Hillary Clinton. Half the things coming out of Trump’s campaign are tin-foil hat conspiracy theories and half-baked nonsense, and then the media spends the rest of its air time discussing Trumps bombastic bullshit that he can’t seem to reign in. The morning after one of the debates, Trump blasted out a bunch of tweets about a beauty pageant contestant. NOBODY CARES! Clinton is trafficking in questionable financial deals between foreign autocrats and Wall Street bankers, and Trump is tweeting about the waistline of a model!?! **Seriously?!?STAY ON MESSAGE YOU TWIT! CLINTON HAS LOBBYISTS ON SPEED DIAL AND YET YOU CANNOT ARTICULATE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHY THIS IS A PROBLEM!** 

It almost feels like Trump was *trying* to lose to Clinton, he didn’t put together a coherent narrative that provides realistic alternatives to what a Clinton administration looks like. Build a wall? Make Mexico pay for it? Deport 11 million illegal aliens? Are you fucking kidding me? That is the best you can offer? In what universe is any of that sensible or realistic? The GOP is supposed to be the party of sensible government and an ethical custodian of taxpayer dollars. If you can’t show me that your grand plans meet the basic tenants of common sense, then go back to your golf course and high rise penthouse and never speak in public again. 
"
98,Thank you for truly loving your wife. 
99,"I spent a few months defending my Trump-supporting coworkers to my friends, explaining that they're good people, definitely not racist, just a bit ignorant and worried about their jobs and wanting to vote according to what their Union supports.

Since Wednesday morning I've had to keep my office door closed at work to block out the comments, and I've had to unfollow each of them on Facebook, one by one, for posting vile, anti-immigrant and anti-black content, or making comments mocking the ""liberal scum"" for being sad the day after the election.

I'm looking for a new job."
100,"That physical attractiveness (in a narrow, people-on-TV-based range) is the be-all, end-all of finding partners, and that people who are not gorgeous will definitely be forever alone because of this. 

All of us are surrounded by perfectly average people in lasting relationships. Where do they come from? How do they happen? If the pudgy, poorly dressed guy or gal in accounting is happily married, maybe you not looking like Brad Pitt is not the sole reason why you're single?"
101,"I was supposed to be on my period during my wedding. It ended up being late and I chalked it up to stress from the wedding and doing midterms. I thought I got lucky because it made sex that night go off without a hitch.

But then a few days later I got a positive on a pregnancy test. Was *not* expecting that. "
102,"A mix of relief that it'll be finally over and I don't have to hear it constantly, and fear and anxiety about who it'll be. "
103,"B-b-but...women don't have to be the pursuers! They get offered penises for free! You mean to tell me you don't want any old penis offering itself for free?

/sarcasm"
104,"i'm a recovering alcoholic. i like myself so much more after four months of sobriety than i ever did during the 13 years i was actively using, so idgaf if that's a deal breaker for some people."
105,Have you ever tried _jolly ranchers_?
106,"My poor 7 year old is still hung up like, ""But mom, Bernie is the nice one, why do this mean man and lady get to be the only people who run? Why doesn't the nice man get his chance?""

I'm just sitting here like, man I feel the same way, don't make me cry!"
107,Channing Tatum type guys. He looks like a neanderthal. 
108,"I don't have any friends. I know many people would consider that a red flag. My social skills are also quite underdeveloped. Also, serious mental health problems in the past. 

I would like to change it but I find it very hard. I'm naturally kind of a cold person. I mean, I'm polite and kind, but I'm very uncomfortable around people and they can tell. I also tend to either romanticize or demonize people I don't know based on insignificant details. Another thing is that I've been 'lonely' for so long, I often feel I would not be able to give it up. I like being by myself most of the time. And TBH sometimes I worry I couldn't learn to like new people anyway. But sometimes I would like to have a friend or two, you know. "
109,"I love how every time a date has told me this, I am sitting across from them with a full face of makeup. And they point to me as an example as ""not much makeup"". "
110,weird that if you give some men a chance all of a sudden there's a time period you're not allowed to go over. But lots of men are willinh to wait for months or years with a woman they're pretending to be friends with and lament being 'friendzoned'. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a cross between these two groups.
111,There are people who restore your faith in humanity. 
112,"I love getting simple compliments from other women. 


When a guy compliments me, it's usually pretty meaningless like ""you have beautiful eyes."" And I'm thinking thanks... I got them from my parents? I don't know, I just have them--I didn't do anything to deserve a compliment. I think guys aren't usually great at complimenting women because they rarely compliment each other, and when they do it's something basic like ""sweet shoes bro.""


When a woman compliments me she's *always* on point. Like ""girl, your eyeshadow is perfect! What shades are those?"" Then I'm like ""holy shit, *thank you* because I spent so long blending that shit!"" Or they'll say ""that dress fits you perfectly!"" And I'll be like ""IT HAS POCKETS!"" And there's a mutual understanding that a great victory was won the second I found that cute dress with pockets.


God, I fucking love women."
113,"Oh and that naturally, we expect the men to pay for the whole thing to boot. :| Even though every single REAL LIFE couple I know has either split it 50/50 (because shocker, the men actually want to be married too? WHAT? it's not just a WIMMENZ thing??) or they split and have assistance from family. 

And of course those sentiments always come from men who aren't even in relationships LOLOL."
114,"None, but I'm Mexican so participate in all Catholic holidays and traditions because food."
115,"Sending dick pics. If I didn't ask, don't send!"
116,"I mean, the nice man did have a chance. Then he lost by 3.6 million votes because he failed to reach out to minority voters and the entire southern USA. "
117,"I'm an Indian living in the US and yesterday, an even bigger event happened back home. Our Prime Minister pretty much removed any illegal aka ""black"" money and no one saw it coming. It's a huge event because India is plagued by corruption and illegal money- less than 4% of its citizens declare their earnings and pay taxes. This is a step in the right direction and I'm proud of this decision.

With regards to the election, it felt hateful, but the end result is what the American people have voted for. "
118,"That I still have the option to just give up on life, get married to a wealthier guy and become a stay at home wife/mom with no job or college degree without being judged that badly. Not saying I would want to do that, but it's nice to have that option. Men usually don't have that option."
119,"We had an extremely ill-advised drunken hookup one night while I was trying to get over a breakup. We both agreed it should be a one-time thing because our friendship was too important and we didn't want to fuck anything up. After a couple months of, ""OK, no wait, THAT was the last time,"" we finally just decided to give dating a shot. Almost three years later, we live together and have a baby on the way. :) And he's still my best friend. "
120,"This is so common. Every average boring schlub thinks they deserve a supermodel genius with a great job who's also a gourmet chef and yoga instructor, but as soon as a woman is like ""I like men with beards"" they're apoplectic with rage about how shallow women are."
121,Having to be completely hairless except for the hair on my head. And of course the hair on my head has to be long or else I'm seen as unfeminine.
122,"1. Become better friends with their friends for learning details and for greater potential of being at the same place at the same time. What a coincidence!
-If friendship does not yet exist, use ""A)"" to approach friend and befriend before approaching prey.
   A) Approach prey casually and ask ""So what brings you here?"". You already know what. They live here, It's their third roommates birthday party who's turning 23 and you happen to know they hate chocolate cake. 
  B) Be very ignorant of all the things you already know and proceed to ask questions, ""How old are they? Are you roommates? Did you guys get them a cake? Oh, what kind?""
   C) Disengage from prey and mingle, generally become accepted amongst the group.
   D) Reengage prey at a later point, when they are just between sober and drunk. Tipsy enough to carry on a good conversation. Bring up topics of their interests (because you googled them and stalked their Facebook and dating site profile). 
   E) Repeat A &amp; B throughout the remainder of the night. Make point of saying goodbye to prey when leaving. Leave with a good impression.
   F) Get phone number of prey through friend at later point."
123,"I went on a lovely romantic hike in the mountains with a guy I am newly seeing a few weeks ago, and he turned to me and said proudly, ""there's just something about being in nature with all this fresh air that just makes me need to take a shit. It happens with every guy in my family when we hike."" 

And it became suddenly very apparant that he grew up in a large family without any sisters. His poor mother. "
124,"Context matters. 

Some dude angry with me, mouthing off and calling me a bitch? That's not okay. 

Trying on dresses in a dressing room with a friend and she says, ""YASSS, work it bitch!"" That's cool in my book."
125,"I've always loved the name Gabriel for a boy, but I feel like he'd get teased because the first syllable is ""gay"". Also his moms would be gay, so it would be ""Gaaaaybriel with the gaaay moms"" :(

(We're still undecided on what to name our son who is due to be born any second now!)"
126,"I moved to a new town at age 41, where I knew no one.  I spent about 6 months not knowing many people outside of work.  Then I met one key person (through OK Cupid, honestly), and he introduced me to his friends, invited me to a party at his house.  That one small party introduced me to the core of people I know now.  

I'm not comfortable in bars and clubs either, unless I'm with people I know and just socialize with them.  That doesn't have to be a necessity. "
127,Stop that
128,Incredibly. To the point where I was seriously considering starting to have children in the next couple of years and now I am too terrified to. 
129,Same strategy. I have a 0% success rate.
130,"Similar thing, my ex had an entire relationship for 1.5 years while we were dating before he went to the hospital and both I and another girlfriend showed up. We dumped him and went out to lunch. 

In retrospect, hiding your phone is a big red flag, as is so many family deaths. Also, the drive to Philadelphia does have phone service. 

Still not over it. "
131,Some people are incredibly oblivious. I had someone seriously tell me how much they loved subtle makeup like mine while I had a face full of stage makeup and false lashes on. My eyelids were 4 colors. I thought they were joking. Nope. 
132,"start with coworkers you don't hate, and ask if they want to get a drink after work (if going out with friends/people you know will help your anxiety). if not a drink then just dinner or some other activity. invite them to whatever you're doing on the weekend."
133,"If you have to reprimand an employee always always **always** do it in private. A public display will make so much ill will that is near impossible to recover from. 


Also don't trash your employees to other employees. Especially if they are lower than you on the totem pole. "

""Man, Sophie is really attractive today""

135,"Well I was trying to throw myself into my work but my computer and my printer aren't working. And I'm a government worker in Canada who currently needs access to the Immigration Canada website to do her job, but that's been down since last night, so I've got a great big error message on my screen right now reminding me how everything has gone to shit and no way of really distracting myself. 

But I do have a cup of tea and my dog and SO got extra snuggles before I left for work this morning. I never, ever listen to Christmas music before December, but I've also got the Pentatonix Christmas album going because I might as well look forward to something. So that's what I've got. I am so sorry, America. This is rough. :("
136,Plunder that fucker like it's gold.
137,"I need a lot of time alone. I am a writer, a researcher, and an editor. I cannot do those things with people talking to me in the background. I learn languages obsessively and I can't do that with someone either unless they are in the process of learning as well.

I will not text anyone regularly unless there is actual information to be transmitted. I am happy to chat about actual topics, but none of this ""How are you?"" ""Fine, how are you?"" ""Fine,"" on and on ad nauseum.

I expect that if I spend time with someone, that they actually interact with me instead of being on their phone every ten minutes. If that's a problem, then I prefer being alone.

I don't like going to parties and very seldom do. I would far prefer to be with another couple for dinner than go to a party.

I have no interest in popular culture for the most part, meaning films, television and videogames. My favourite thing to do was to spend time in my family's summer cabin with no electricity. We would swim, look at birds and wildlife, hike and look the auroras at night and read and play games. 

I wouldn't change those things if I could."
138,Women can't be/aren't logical infuriates me the most. Having arguments dismissed out of hand because they're considered 'emotional' or 'irrational' is such rubbish. And the people who are like 'Herp I am 100% logical no emotions me-robot' type are the worst. 
139,"""Women are just *so* emotional,"" exclaims man who punched a hole in the wall after his sports team lost"
140,"If I may be frank for a moment. Fuck being socially punished for 'me' time. I don't give a fuck, I am having a bath this evening with candlit steam licking the soles of my feet while listening to chilled out EDM and it will be fucking excellent."
141,"You guys are crazy friendly - I find it really nice you seem so worried. 

I'm fine, I will be fine. It's just so mind boggled to me that a) creepy assholes like that exist 

And b) that women deal with it almost every time they go out. It disgusts me. 

Sorry you've experienced similar. It really sucks
"
142,"I don't think you get the mentality behind why people are against abortion. It's nothing like pot at all. I was raised very religious and the people in my church literally think it is murder. You're never going to get people who think abortion is murdering a child to support a law allowing abortion. It's not at all about controlling women and their reproductive rights, it's about protecting children from being murdered in their heads.

I am pro-choice and I think most pro-choice people simply don't get why so many people oppose it. "
143,"Guy here, is this actually something you consider flirting? I'm just a little confused, because it all seems very non commital. Is your aim to actually make a move or to get the guy to make the move?"
144,"Constant jealousy! He would get very moody/sad whenever I talked about anything having to do with my friends. 
             
Me: I talked with my friend today, she said her cats are doing better!
           
  Him: Oh? It seems like you two had a great time. Why don't you hang out with her more? Why do you even                   
             bother with me?

At the time I was only really hanging out with my friends who were girls too, so I really don't know what he was always so upset about. Also every time I went out with them he would remind he that he ""was trusting me"". Then while I was out he would constantly text me saying he was worried, or asking if I was ok, if I was staying hydrated, and if I was eating enough. Then when I wouldn't respond he would say something along the lines of ""Okay, I get it. I'm ruining your day out. Don't bother responding to your poor worried boyfriend."" It's not like we were going clubbing or partying, I would go over to their houses to play video games or put on face masks and hang out in a hot tub. 
Eventually I just went through his phone and found that he had been texting some girl for sex and to complain to her about me. It explained so much of his behavior. We broke up a couple months later because he had joined a dating website and I found out.  
"
145,im fat.
146,"My cat chews on plastic. All plastic. She doesn't eat it, she just chews on it. 

My other cat tries to be like her so he tries to chew on paper. He doesn't do it right, though, and ends up accidentally eating it and immediately spitting it out. "
147,"I look at pictures and gifs in reddit way more often than actually watching videos, because viruses. I have a tab open right now, actually. 

I generally look at porn every few days. "
148,"Haha, I do this too! If the guy I'm into is talking to my friend (they're good friends, I met him and talked to him a few times and developed a crush), I'll make jokes and stuff while looking at my friend and ignore him. It's really bad. "
149,I hand knit chunky scarves and do manicures on the side at my college. I live in the Midwest so college girls keep me p busy. 
150,"Super muscle-y guys, I hate the 'ripped' look. I like a man who look fit and healthy, but I'm not in the market for body-builders or pro-athletes.."
151,"Our dog likes to lick the wall when she's done drinking water.  Husband thinks she's trying to dry her tongue off, I think she's just a nut."
152,"Right now I'm selling a bunch of things on eBay/letgo/Poshmark etc. I'd like to do some art on the side but I seem to lack the discipline.

I know someone who runs what basically amounts to a consignment shop out of her house. She works with mostly clothes, but you can drop off almost any item in good condition, she sells it on FB or CL and gives you half of what she makes. I asked her about her profits and they're about $500-$1000 a week; however, she's very disciplined.

Edit: I also forgot that I just started pet-sitting, which is pretty much the best side job ever."
153,"I am me.  If I was not a woman, I would not be me.  Pretty much that.  I like being me."
154,I've seen guys go from love to hate it in the span of one match against me 😏 apparently girls playing games is fine as long as they're not good at it.
155,"&gt; the end result is what the American people have voted for.

Well, technically, with Clinton winning the popular vote, this is explicitly what we *didn't* vote for."
156,"As someone who *needs* hormonal birth control to balance hormones, I am also worried they would not only get rid of abortion but begin to encroach on birth control as well :( "
157,"Oh I have a list: 

* Drunk girl bathroom chats. Seriously I've met some really lovely girls whilst drunk in a bathroom 
* Being close with your friends and not having to worry. Sometimes I think guys struggle to be close to one another.  Today I told my friend that she looked great and gave another friend a hug cause she had a stressful meeting. I don't think I could do that so easily if I were male.
* I love that I can do stereotypically girly things without any social stigma for example if I wanted to get my legs waxed I could. No pressure. If a man wanted to get his legs waxed there's a lot of social judging. 
* I love how flexible my wardrobe can be.
* boobs
* If I'm cold no one judges me for being wrapped up in blankets or cute jumpers
* If I want to cry I'll god damn cry. 
* most sex toys are aimed at women so that's nice
* Underwear! There's so much variety. Boys get Briefs, boxers, boxer briefs and that's kind of it."
158,"I was young and in bad shape when I had mine. Had I not had the option, I would have gone straight to suicide. There are a lot of women and girls out there today, who are as young and in at least as bad a shape as I was..."
159,"I've had sex with a, um, *limited* sample of people of two genders, but here's my two cents anyway (as a bi woman with zero gender preference):

* With (some) women, an orgasm isn't the end of sex, but sex can also sometimes end without an orgasm. I like that flexibility. My boyfriend is exhausted after an orgasm (though there are advantages to having a set end point, I suppose), and I would, for some reason, feel awful ending a sex session without giving him at least one. 
* It is *so* nice not to have to worry about pregnancy during sex. Really. I'm on a reliable form of birth control, and my boyfriend knows I would abort if somehow it failed, but I am *so* reassured every single month when my period comes around.
* Boners are an awesome thing. I like being able to tell he's aroused even when he's fully clothed. 
* On the other hand, boobs are really awesome too.
* This is a huuuge generalization and I don't have anything to back it up and my boyfriend is clearly a counter-example, but I still believe, in general, women are the better kissers.
* I think being vocal in bed is largely seen as a female thing. Guys should do it more, because it's fucking hot as hell."
160,"The British TV station Channel 4 commissioned a small study for its *Dispatches* program in 1995. Of the 81 cases of male sexual victimization that they looked at -- 60 of which were penetrative rapes, and 21 sexual assaults of some other kind -- the *least* common response among male victims, at 17%, was physical resistance. 23% tried to talk their way out of the situation. 60% froze, reacting neither physically or verbally. It's almost the default response, for both sexes, in these kinds of situations."
161,"In the wake of depressing news, I want to share something a little happier:

I'm Indian and come from a very Hindu family. One of the things Hinduism preaches is that you take what you're born with and do with it what you can. I remember having a conversation with my mother about transgender people and how she couldn't understand why they couldn't just be happy in the bodies they were born with. I think she saw being transgender as some sort of cosmetic thing. Using this belief I knew she had, I explained that many transgender people also feel intense gender dysphoria, and that in many cases, this is something they were born with. We discussed this for a long time, but she came to the conclusion that maybe there was a reason they were born in the body they were, but that doesn't mean that they shouldn't be able to change it. And that maybe, something in the journey of transitioning is the reason why they were assigned the wrong gender at birth in the first place.

It's a small step, but having that conversation with her and seeing how open minded she really is despite coming from a very conservative culture gives me so much hope, and reminds me that people all around the world are having these types of conversations every day. "

163,"They whine that women can get sex with any old penis whenever they want. They don't take into account that, if I were to take up the offer, the sex would range from feeling like nothing at all to downright painful. 

I would rather have no sex than unenjoyable sex. Yet somehow, they are envious of this. "
164,"&gt; Similarly, that dating is formulaic, and if you just follow x procedure or course of action that will net you dating success.

I find that men who believe this also tend to view women as just two dimensional beings with vaginas. They're always looking for ""a girlfriend,"" not a specific person with thoughts and feelings."

168,"I am a dancer (stripper). I work 2 nights a week and all the money I make is spending cash for my husband and I. He works full time and also has his own business, so the money he makes pays the bills and goes to savings. I'm basically a stay at home mom during the day, then after the kids go to bed I go into work. They don't even know I'm gone since I work 9pm-3am.

172,"I think Roe vs. Wade itself will probably remain intact, but that some states are going to enact even more laws that *effectively* ban or severely restrict abortion.  We're hopefully not going to have abortion reclassed as ""fetal homicide,"" but we are going to have radically different healthcare in red states and blue states and the Supreme Court will do nothing about it.

Hopefully, Trump will only have a chance to replace Scalia.  I'm honestly pretty disappointed that aging, left-leaning justices didn't take the opportunity to retire during Obama's term...  It's unusual for one party to hold onto the presidency for three terms so there was always a high likelihood of a Republican being in office.  The Supreme Court theoretically should not be a political entity, but clearly it is one now."
173,"My skill and interest in gaming is often doubted.

Many times I have been accused of faking an interest in gaming just to get attention from guys. People often don't believe me when I tell them my hardcore gaming history. In mmos I have been told ""*you can't be a girl, you're too good at this game*"". On one occasion some guys didn't believe I own a Gameboy original and I brought it in the week after only to be accused of borrowing it from someone.

It happens less these days, likely due to my friends tending to be older (*I'm 32*) and that it's much less unusual to find female gamers now. 10 years ago it was awful. "

176,"The first time I cuddled my boyfriend who lives halfway across the country. I had been talking to him for months, totally falling in love with him.

187,"Remind yourself that, at least in your day-to-day life, you can still make a difference. You can love people well, show compassion, be kind, and stay strong. America isn't built on a president, it's built on people. It's disappointing that somehow a candidate like this has won- but Clinton still won the popular vote. And she won the younger demographics. The majority of people in the country, and especially the majority of the people who will be running the country in the future, don't agree with Trump. We'll weather the next four years and hope he's been putting on a flashy show and he isn't able to get much done. Then we'll try again.

199,"You wake up every morning, look in the mirror and point out everything you love about yourself. If you can't find something, then choose your eyes. Your eyes see all the beauty the world has to offer. Do this every day. 

Be kind to others. You'll be beautiful because of your kindness. Even when people are mean, just be nice. You'll love yourself for being kind. It'll make you feel wonderful inside. 

Do not compare yourself to others. Realize you're beautiful in your own ways. Jealousy is common and use it to better yourself. Other people are beautiful, too. But you, you are beautiful in your own ways. Realize it. 

Know that other people love you. Whether it be your family, friends or significant other. But also realize that you do not need them to be happy. People will betray you, it's life. You still have yourself at the end of the day. 

Find hobbies. Play video games, or do a sport, or read books. Or comment on every Reddit post you know, or learn to juggle, or get a dog. It'll distract your mind and also help you to feel whole. 

Keep a journal. Write how you're feeling often. If you're happy, or unhappy. Keep your favorite parts of your day in this journal. Or keep the worst parts of your days in your journal. This one, I would recommend the most. After a while of writing, you see the beauty of the ups and downs of life. And you realize you can overcome so much of it. 

Life isn't perfect. Life will never be perfect. But once you're happy, life is beautiful. You won't be happy everyday for the rest of your life, but once you learn to love yourself, you know you'll be able to be happy again. Love comes from happiness from within. You'll get there with time. "
200,"Here's an example. My ex got out of bed and said he was going to make coffee. After my shower, I went to the kitchen to get a cup of coffee, and when I found the pot empty, I asked him why he hadn't made any yet. He answered ""I never said anything about making coffee"" Now, this wasn't a big deal to me, I was happy to make the coffee, but confused about his reply. I said he had said he was going to make coffee when he left the bedroom 10 minutes ago and he insisted that he had not, and joked that I must be going crazy. I did have a bit of a short term memory issue, so this was easy for him to exploit. This kind of thing was played out over and over again in random, mundane situations like who put the milk back in the fridge or who said what, etc. Until I really did doubt myslef. Over time, the gaslighting became more sinister, but by then, I was already unable to trust my own memory or perception of things. He had me insisting to my doctor that I was bipolar and in need of medication, and despite 3 different doctors telling me I was not bipolar, he insisted I was, and I believed I was broken in some way. By the time I divorced him 10 years later, I was a mess. He would continue insist to my face that he had never laid a hand on me, but I knew better, but it's pretty convincing when he says it. It took me longer than it should have to trust my own memories. That hole in the wall where the coffee cup that missed my head landed helped. 

Gaslighting is a form of mental abuse where the abuser plays tricks on the victim's mind, convincing them that their own thoughts, feelings, perceptions, and memories are unreliable and/or unreasonable.

However, once a 2nd conservative is added to the court to replace RBG or Breyer, it will be over. Even with Kennedy continuing to move leftward and serving as a buffer, we'll be done.

Alito and Roberts, and of course Thomas, will never budge on abortion - if you need proof, just look at how angry they were about Hellerstedt."
204,"Conservative state legislatures wasted no time in passing abortion restrictions after the last midterm elections. Legislative activist groups like ALEC have these bills pre-written, and they stay ready to hand them to their lawmaking friends. Abortion restrictions pop up immediately, and watchdog groups sue immediately. It happened before and it will happen again.

To give you an example, the latest SCOTUS abortion decision was Hellerstedt this summer. The state law in question was passed in late 2013. That's less than 3 years in between, and for part of that time the law was unenforceable due to the lowest court's decision invalidating it.

206,"Everybody is saying it's not a thing.

Because it's not a thing.

But in case anyone reading this is thinking, 'Hey, what about the 'Ladies First' rule or 'Girls Get in Free' nights in clubs? Surely that's a privilege in its way?' let me explain why it's not, by the modern definition of the word, a privilege:

1. Most female 'privileges' derive from a point of assumed inferiority to men. The 'Ladies First' rule, as well as things like men paying for dates and being 'chivalrous' are traces left from a society where men provided for women, who were often made into powerless subordinates by the traditional family structure. Men paid for women to eat, because women had little or no independent access to money. 

2. The aspects of what might be termed female privilege that don't date back to outmoded societal norms are, perhaps more insidiously, objectifying and commodifying women. 'Girls Night' in the club, where women get in free, and sometimes even get a free drink, is a money making tactic to lure in thirsty dudes who want to be where lots of girls are in order to up their chances to get laid. Is it nice to get a free drink? Yes. Is it a privilege? No, because that free drink is the expression of a power structure in which you are the product, on which men spend money in the club.

3.
So, male privilege is based in a society where men are assumed to be more competent and intelligent, and are thus given more opportunities. Female 'privilege' is rooted in the idea that a woman is either an object to be won with favours (or alcohol) or in need of assistance based on her gender. I'd more accurately term what people call a female privilege as a perk. 
A consolation prize. Like, 'Yeah, you spend your entire life being condescended to, threatened, and possibly controlled, based on a demographic factor you had absolutely no control over, but here, let me give you my bus seat to make it better!'"

209,"I'm not enthusiastic either way. People tell me I should be enthused about a woman getting elected as president, but I'm just very unimpressed with *who* she is. Gender of politicians is very unimportant to me compared to their actual policy. 

But it looks like trump will lose, which is good. I'm getting a bit sick of hearing from The_Donald on the front page of reddit. Their tantrum when trump loses will be of epic proportions, but then I feel we're stuck with a mediocre president. So thats hardly worth celebrating."
210,"A lot of these replies are giving you ideas on how to meet people but the key is becoming friends after you meet them. For that, you have to be proactive. Instead of meeting someone and saying ""yeah this was fun"" and then going on your way, you need to get their number, call them, make actual plans; it's a lot like dating. And when you make plans, encourage they bring others into it by asking if they have any friends that might also be interested in the plans you made or simply stating ""bring your fiends, the more the merrier!"""

On the other hand, any time I see ""female privilege"" brought up I usually *am* pretty fucking side-eye-ey, since it tends to be by folks who also think women and men have the *same amount* of privilege.

EDIT: I'm not gonna lie, I'm actually pretty disappointed at a lot of the extended discussion going on in this thread. Ignoring advantages that you have doesn't make them not exist, and acknowledging them doesn't make inequalities disappear. It's pretty important to be able to recognize difficulties that other folks face that you may not experience. "
232,"I think both sides are a bit dishonest in their discussion of whether or not having sex is easier for women.

I do think there's some truth in the fact that, as a woman, I would have an easier time finding a man who wanted to stick his penis in me than a man would have finding a woman in whom to stick his penis. That doesn't mean every woman could find someone, but I think denying this general trend is a bit dishonest.

However, this analysis totally ignores other completely relevant factors. A woman engaging in casual sex faces higher risk for a lower likelihood of reward. I have a much lower chance of having a pleasurable experience than my partner, and I have a much higher chance of being in a dangerous situation. "
233,"I am bisexual, heteroromantic (so 50/50 bisexual, but 100% only date men). 

Women pros: The sex can go on *forever*, you aren't restricted by penises. Tons of clitoral and whole body stimulation. So much oxytocin (I read that two women give off a crazy amount together, and this is part of why lesbians U-haul). Tons of orgasms each, and you don't have to wait for them to recover after each ones - as Nina Hartley says, vaginas are sturdy!

Also there's no set way to do things, it's not like foreplay then PIV. I always end up doing about 10 different things with the women I'm with, and it all just melds together in one long sex session. 

Another huge pro - you can't get pregnant! Having casual sex with men is really stressful because the birth control pill is hell for me.

Men pros: The only pro I can think of, and it is a con of being with women too, is the stigma that comes with being gay. Although, this is a dating thing more than a sex thing. 

I struggled a lot with accepting my same-sex attraction, and having to deal with people saying it isn't ""real sex"", objectifying us and asking for threeways, or just homophobia in general. But hopefully one day that won't be an issue at all."

236,"&gt;you do not have to date her. 

DING DING DING! That's exactly it. Am I going to lie to you and say I don't like those things? No. I happen to be someone who'd like (and has....) some of the things you mention. But not all women are like this. A good chunk of my friends don't care about any of those things.

Most importantly though? No one says a man needs to date this woman...go date someone else. Reality check to the men who don't realize this: women come in all shapes, sizes and personalities.  You don't want to foot the bill on $300 dinners? Then don't date a person who likes those things. Don't want to buy a diamond? Don't date someone who wants those things. So simple!

238,"Flirting isn't a specific formula as much as it is something you communicate through your eyes and body language. It's subtly touching your neck or chest while giving them a sheepish (or wolfish, depending on how far into it you are) grin. It's that special laugh a girl reserves for a guy she's into. It's catching their gaze across the room but instead of looking away, you hold it and undress them with your eyes. It's touching them in playful but unexpected ways (example: on my second date with my husband, we were bowling with another couple and when we got our last strike to win, he was expecting a high five but I gave him a hug. He always points this out as an electric moment for him). Flirting is in the witty banter you share back and forth, maybe with a hint of innuendo (again, depending on how far into the process you are). It's suddenly giving them a sincere compliment out of the blue. It's how you treat them differently, perhaps preferentially, above their peers. Flirting is a dance, but to know the steps you have to listen for the tempo and every song is different. "

It can't also be too thick for the amount of toppings there are. A pizza that has nothing but sauce, cheese, and pepperoni does not need a thick crust.

254,"My current SO and I started out super casual. We met through a friend of a friend's Facebook and we lived in separate states. I'd come up and spend a weekend, we'd have really great frequent sex, get dinner, then I'd go home and we'd repeat in another few months. If one of us started seeing someone else, the other wordlessly backed off. It's not cool to send nudes while he's dating someone and vice versa.  

Over time we became best friends and confided everything in the other yet still kept things ridiculously casual. Eventually we  started taking about being closer to see what that'd be like. One of us would drink too much and tell the other they meant the world to them or couldn't  see their life without them. I love you and I need you without saying the words.   

Finally, after watching me get back together with my idiot ex and then be subsequently dumped (with an *email*. An EMAIL.) on my next visit out, forehead to forehead with the blankets pulled up high he said he'd fallen in love with me. I said (nothing for like 5 seconds shocked and half thinking I'd imagined it) I was falling in love as well. We walked around, late into the night, talking. How long? When did you? Why didn't you sooner?    

we decided I'd move out to his city for 6 months to see what it'd be like living close together. We'd only ever spent sparse weekends together. I moved out there and stayed with him while I found a place to live. That proved hard as hell. Since his lease was up in 6 months, it didn't seem to make sense for me to find my own place if in 6 months we might want to move in together anyway so we decided to skip it and I moved in with him.   

Whew. All that was 3 years ago. We have a new place together and adopted two adorable littermate kittens. I'm reeeeeasonably sure we'll be engaged perhaps in 2017. He's slow as molasses but his intentions are pretty clear. :) and I couldn't be happier. He's my best friend. "
255,"My ex husband exhibited behaviors that felt a lot like gaslighting, so I'm curious about others' experiences. It was things like, insisting during an argument that he never said something, I was just remembering it wrong. Or saying something in a really mean or angry tone, then insisting that wasn't how he said it, and I shouldn't be upset. In any disagreement, he always insisted that he was right, that he was the logical and reasonable one, and that I was the inconsistent and irrational one. He'd say the most ridiculous things but in a cold, measured tone of voice. If I raised my voice at all, or let any kind of emotion color my voice, he'd take that as proof that he was calm and I was not, and therefore his point of view was more valid than mine. Or he'd move my stuff without telling me, then say that if I didn't leave things laying around I wouldn't lose them. That wasn't all, as our marriage went on, he kept getting more controlling, condescending, and judgmental in other ways too. 

It became really bizarre when he started using my towel, and my toothbrush. I always, always used the towel on the right side of the towel rack, and he used the one on the left side. I'd replace his towel more frequently, because he played a lot of sports so his towel got more use than mine. Then one day I noticed that my towel was always damp for a few days straight, while his was dry and pristine. I asked him if he was using my towel, and why. He said, perfectly matter-of-fact, that he has always used the towel on the right. It sounds so stupid, but it sent a chill down my spine. I said that was impossible, and explained how I knew because of my routine of replacing and laundering the towels. He just said, ""Okay I guess I used the wrong towel then,"" as if it was nothing. If that was me, and someone pointed out that I'd suddenly started doing something completely different, without being aware that I had changed, I'd be a bit stunned. But he just turned back to the TV as though the conversation never happened. The same thing happened with my toothbrush shortly after. 

We're now separated, and every time I start to think I made a mistake by breaking up our marriage, I remind myself of what it was like, and why I was so unhappy. "

263,Those same men will make fun of a woman who *truly* has no makeup on.  Neutral makeup is still makeup!  It's like they don't know what a human female looks like without a dab of makeup on.

Those are the only ones they consider women anyways."

268,"This new family I'm babysitting for. I should've trusted my instincts when she didn't want to pay me as much as I asked (it was on the low side of what was fair hourly). Now a month later the mom keeps asking if she can pay me late. Uhhhh no? I have a life and bills and this is the way I make a living. So irritated and I'm quitting this family soon. 

I really wish I trusted my gut and never started working for them lol "
269,"I just try to get know them like I would anyone I found interesting. I always go in with the mindset of ""she seems awesome, I want to get to know her"" without thinking about dating or sex or any of that. 

If it turns out we fancy each other, it will be pretty evident without us having to purposely flirt. For example we'll end up texting a lot, arranging to meet up a lot, giggling, blushing, having close physical contact, complimenting each other a lot, etc. That stuff should just happen naturally, it's not anything you need a technique for. (Unless you're trying to manipulate people into sleeping with you, but I have no experience in that.)"
270,"Periods, but since birth control stops them for me it's a wash. 

Edit - yeast infections and UTIs also suck. "
271,No one on Reddit has ever done that. 
272,You don't see these kinds of shit posts in AW very often. It's a nice change of pace.
273,"And then they're the ones who propose.

Seriously, how many women propose compared to men? Yet most people I've seen who whine about marriage being a trap are guys. Like dude just don't get married lol."

I like to wear my prettiest lipsticks too. "

280,"I get to wear really gorgeous lingerie. Men get to wear neck ties.

If I am feeling down and generally shitty, I can cuddle with Theo and not feel silly.

I can wear lots of really nice shoes in a million different styles. Men have black wingtips...or brown wingtips.

I have the option of wearing support pantyhose. Men have boxers...or other boxers.

I get to whine unreasonably about bras, yet find new and interesting ways of spending $75 so my tits are comfy *and* gorgeous. 

Men get to wear socks. Black, brown, or navy. I get to wear tights or sheers in about 120000000 different styles."
281,I've always said that the best thing about being a woman is that I can think about sex. All. Day. Long. And have nothing to show for it save for maybe some wet panties. I don't have to worry about weird erections.

283,"As much as I love 30 Rock, Liz Lemon, *and* Tina Fey, I do find that character a little annoying sometimes. The jokes about her being an out of shape, over-eating, lazy, sloppy woman just don't line up with the fact that she's played by someone as thin and good-looking as Tina Fey, and the character herself is very successful.  

I get that Tina Fey is considered not as pretty *for Hollywood* but in real life she looks great. "
284,Ask if I'm on my period when I'm emotional. It's the worst. It makes me feel crazy with rage. 
285,"I was recovering at my parents house after having my wisdom teeth removed, still groggy from the anesthesia and pain meds. I curled up on the couch with a big blanket to sleep it off when my sister's dogs, a Boxer and a Boston Terrier, that my parents were watching, decided they needed to sleep with me. They both crawled under the blanket, the Boxer curled up behind my bend knees with her head on my hip and the Boston curled up in front. It was warm and I couldn't move, but it was wonderful and just what I needed. 


As for non-animal cuddles, I really like it when the guy I'm seeing basically uses me as his pillow. He wraps his arm around me and rests his head against my upper back or my chest depending how I'm laying. I could stay like that forever. It makes me feel warm and happy and safe. I love me some cuddles. "

288,"I'm an egg donor. You can donate six times in your lifetime and a handful more if a previous recipient requests to have you donate again. This is one of those widely misunderstood things, so please feel free to ask questions.  
   
  
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO CONSIDER if you are thinking about doing egg donation is whether you trust your clinic or not. Do NOT get sucked in by clinics that offer you an insane amount of money. They are money machines and they are taking advantage of you and the recipient. I get about 3k (US) per donation and that's a typical amount. If they offer you 10k, keep looking. The money is tempting, but this is *your health* and it is not worth it. A good clinic should be honest, personable, and invested in *you*. I have been reminded multiple times by staff at my clinic that I have a choice in when and how I donate. If a month doesn't work for me, either my recipient can find another donor or wait. If I called them tomorrow and said I was done donating forever, it would be fine. Find a clinic that respects you and your body.  

You have to be in good health, under 35, and have a relatively good genetic history. It's completely anonymous: the recipient knows what you look like, but not your name or contact information.  
  
The actual donation cycles are only about two weeks (personally mine run about 11 days from start to retrieval) long. During those two weeks, you self-administer injections into your belly/thigh. They are not very painful, and the needle is short and very thin. These drugs stimulate your ovaries to produce and grow egg follicles. Every few days, you go into the office to have blood drawn, your follicles counted, and to be given updated dosages based on your progress. Once you're ready, you will have the retrieval done. It's a relatively short procedure, but it is under anesthesia.   
  
Recovery takes a few days, but after the first day you can typically go about business as usual (just no sex or exercise for about a week).   
  
The most widely discussed potential complication with egg donation is Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome, or *OHSS*. There was a very popular article circulating a few years ago discussing this complication. Essentially, your ovaries start leaking fluid into your abdomen, which can be painful and can cause your lungs to fill with fluid if it becomes severe. This is more likely if you have high progesterone levels during your cycle, and your clinic will administer the proper medications for this.  
  
I have had *very* high progesterone levels for each and every donation. I have never had OHSS so severe that I needed to go to the doctor. What works for me is drinking only fluids with electrolytes (as per the clinic's recommendation), limiting sugars and upping protein intake, and limiting my fluid intake based on weight gain. What this means is that if I'm drinking fluids, and only peeing a little bit and gaining weight over the course of several hours, I will cut back on drinking fluids.   
  
I know this is a lot of information, but I hope to clear up some of the misinformation out there on egg donation in case anyone thinks it may be a viable option for them. For me, it's been a lifesaver through a financially turbulent period of my life. "
289,"Nothing because I don't know how. If anyone has an actual practical suggestion, let me know. "
290,"No, I would feel very unsafe and it would also feel forced. I also wouldn't meet someone based on just pictures."
291,"This. It's quite maddening that creeps like that are normalized, and that, more importantly, it's on the person on the receiving end to either (1) avoid these situations, or (2) protect themselves when it happens. 

Wouldn't things just be easier if we taught people that it's NOT okay to touch someone without their explicit consent?"
292,"My cat likes being smacked along the spine, sort of like a downward open hand motion repetitively. Occasionally I pretend his back is a pair of bongos. 

Must un-kink his spine or something. Either that or he's a masochist. "

295,All the characters on Girls. They're all horrible people and I don't understand the appeal.
296,"You know, if the guy is into you too, he's almost certainly thinking ""shame, she's really attractive but clearly has no interest in me.""

I know that's what I'd feel in that situation and I certainly wouldn't attempt to pursue anything as a result."
297,"I can't think of anything I want.  My son wants us to get our DNA analyzed and see exactly what our heritage is, so I think that's what we'll do."
298,"I'm honestly stunned.

Since December 2015 when I was talking amongst other people in a book club, I was adamant that there's no way Trump could win an election, let alone a primary, given his lack of qualifications.

Now? The Republicans captured the Senate and the House, and looks like the White House too.

It's been very clear to me that I've been living in an echo chamber, both on Reddit, Facebook, and media sources.

I should've been more receptive to what Michael Moore wrote (http://michaelmoore.com/trumpwillwin/) or LA Times writer Vincent Bevins (https://www.facebook.com/vincent.bevins/posts/10105426634702363?pnref=story).

I won't call the other side a derogatory word because it's simplistic. There were very legitimate reasons to dislike Clinton and the Democratic party."

300,"I'm sorry this happened to you. I think one of the worst parts for me is how mad I get at myself afterwards. Like I should've screamed or had him thrown out or hit back or something and I'm mad at myself for just disentangling or pushing him away or (the worst) nervously giggling and extracting myself from the situation like that. 

I go back and forth between being really mad and blowing it off as not a big deal. The thing is, it *is* a big deal, but acknowledging that gets me fruitlessly angry and means I have to deal with it. I guess I did deal with it--I basically never go to clubs anymore, maybe a couple times a year, and always with my boyfriend who is bigger and scarier than I am.

Try not to beat yourself up. You handled it well and he's a fucking ass. "
301,"Have pets. Will always have pets. Have bouts of depression. Not completely decided on the kid thing one way or another. Spend a lot of time with my family. 

I have no problem with any of these things about me. I mean I could live without the depression but I manage. "
302,"Oh, you don't want to have sex with people you're not attracted to either huh? Despite the fact that you *could* easily have sex with them? What a concept. "
303,What stimulates their penis
304,"EXACTLY. I swear women are less shallow than men and would much likely pick a not so good looking guy who's smart, kind than someone who looks like a model. I've been saying this for a long time, many men have much higher standards. I've seen gorgeous women with average looking men(and no they weren't rich) but never the same with guys."
305,"No, he didn't care whether you changed your mind or not. He got off on doing it, and probably on making you feel a little uncomfortable, which is the truly gross part. Guys like that don't want a mutually enjoyable sexual encounter. They want to push boundaries and make other people feel uncomfortable."

So... does my tactic work?

No! Guys almost always end up dating my attention-seeking friend and then only sometimes making a pass at me later."
310,"Yeah, because us women can only stay at home right? We can't be the breadwinners and have men take half of our shit when we get divorced, obviously."
311,I'm sorry to hear that. That's truly awful. 
312,"I don't envy women and people of color right now, you will see the same things in America that happened in Great Britain after brexit. Now they know they won, they have the power to discriminate against anyone they don't like.

317,"Trump is, reportedly, getting wrapped up in a vendetta against everyone who ""wronged"" him.  

If he loses, he's going to have to choose between dealing with his own upcoming indictments, going after the women who made allegations against him, going after the politicians who denigrated him (Dems and Reps both), going after Hillary, going after the media, retaining the support of his base, building his media empire, maintaining his existing businesses, continuing to kiss Putin's ass, etc, etc.

She offers the tea to me, cause she doesn't want it and knows I like tea. I take it and don't mention it's actually my gift...

She would've felt terrible, and it doesn't bother me that she didn't like it (I wasn't sure if it was her *cup of tea*). The only thing that slightly bothers me, is that she didn't even remember I gave it to her..."

He soon followed suit, working longer hours, having to work on the weekends (looking back, the ones that she didn't work), he became mean and angry towards me, which is definitely not him.

I knew something was up but I needed solid evidence.  One day at work I checked her phone that she left unlocked and in the open on the counter, and found damaging texts between her and someone with a ""code name"" who was obviously him.  I confronted him, she got fired and he almost got fired from his job as well."
358,"My brothers friend had unprotected sex with his girlfriend knowing she wasn't on birth control and so of course she got pregnant yet according to all of his male friends, she's the one who trapped him.

359,"Tall men. Lots of women seem to swoon at tall guys, but I honestly never understood it. I prefer men to be a just few inches taller than me. Anything more is excessive. I briefly dated a very tall guy and it was very awkward because he had to either pick me up or bend over to kiss me. "

I was downright suicidal with guilt. Guilt at putting him in this situation, guilt at ruining his life, guilt at feeling gross and dirty after what happened.

So for everyone who just supported a man who nationally announced that you should grab a woman by the pussy, please take a big ""Fuck you"" from me."

365,Easier to justify so much money in politics when it takes 18 months of campaigning and years of canvassing. I was hoping Trump would bankrupt himself trying to get elected. Alas.
366,"I'm a 59 year old man and this worries me immensely. 

The way I see it, this is not about Trump. The Republican party hates him. I would be surprised if he is still President by the end of next year. The party isn't celebrating Trump's victory, they're all about Pence and Mike Pence will do every thing he can to pass ""personhood laws"".

He and his ilk want to impose a 'Fundamentalist Christian' theocratic fascism on everybody. Look at his record as governor of Indiana. He gutted the public health system and oversaw the reduction in the availability of health care to poor women and men. In doing so Pence also caused the largest HIV outbreak in recent history by denying health funding for the opiate addiction wave sweeping rural Indiana. 

You may ask, as an old dude, how would this affect me? Well, it doesn't directly; it affects my daughter,  my friends, the women I work with, my family members and the freedoms of overall  society. These things are more important than myself as an individual. 

They won't say much about it at first. They'll let things simmer down until our attention is diverted, either by events  or purposely, then they'll slip it right by. Before you know it, all women's reproductive choices will be gone. It's  going to take a lot of vigilance to keep women,  our wives, daughters, friends of all stripes and coworkers safe from these extremists. "
