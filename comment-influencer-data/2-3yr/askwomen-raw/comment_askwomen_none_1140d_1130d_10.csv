0,Yelling is a deal breaker for me. So many people find it acceptable to scream at their SO because they're angry. I'm a grown ass woman and I'm not going to be yelled at because someone can't control their emotions. Get out of here with that crap.
1,"""Omfg it moved on its own wtf""

No one tells you in sex ed that it can jump around and shit. I thought getting an erection was a smooth process like an elevator or something. "
2,"Met a guy yesterday about six. He asked me out for lunch, sure, could be fun.

I get his number and text him, he asks to meet up the next day at 7PM. That's not exactly lunch, but sure.

Then he asks what time I get off and if I want to make a late night visit...no. I don't. 

It's ok, he understands. But can I send him a pic? Fuck off. He was blocked by 10:30pm.

Those were pretty clear signs."
3,"Deathly allergic to cats or dogs

I understand allergies and I am sympathetic.  But I am very passionate about my pets.  This is an absolute deal breaker."
4,"I'm 26 and haven't been even close to a relationship in 4 years. I've moved around a lot too, so friends are kinda... sparse, or not where I am. I occasionally visit them or they visit me here, but we're talking once or twice a year. I play football and get on with my team, but they're not really friend friends yet - it is a good way to start out in a new place, I've found. I get on with the people at work, but they're all a lot older than me. 

So most of the time, I do stuff alone. Weekends when I don't go out to the shop/pub, I might only speak to my mum on the phone. 

Key is to *me*: Get comfortable with yourself. It's harder than it sounds. But like yourself. Have fun by yourself. Buy yourself things. Hang out with friends when you can, but really, be happy hanging out with yourself. I got paid yesterday, but had nobody to go out with, do something fun with - so I bought myself a nice Turkish takeaway, found a film to watch, lit my candles, put my little dangly lights on, had an ice cold cider and chilled the fuck out. Tonight I got myself a frozen mojito packet and am gonna make steak. 

I do me. If someone turns up who wants in on that, great, awesome. If they don't? I'm not fussed. Being on your own has awesome advantages too. I'm applying for all sorts of jobs all over the place. Because if I get it, I can just pack my stuff and go. I can hang out in no clothes if I want to. I can watch trashy tv and not be judged. I can cook stuff I want to eat and experiment. If it goes wrong, the only person who has to eat it is me. 

I am possibly just a bit weird, but it doesn't bother me too much. I lack self-confidence sometimes, but that wouldn't really change - I just hold myself to high standards in a lot of things, and if I don't meet it, I lose a ton of confidence. But that's not to do with other people really. "
5,"Reddit has made me feel SO normal about 99% of lady stuff. 

extra pooping while on period? check

hairs on boobs? check 

horny during period? check "
6,"Physical compliments or compliments very focused on appearance and beauty, excessive groping and being handsy, doesn't seem to care too much about getting to know you, insisting you meet at his place on the first date."
7,Bad money management and impulsiveness calls for instability in by book. Having 3$ in your bank account and going to the zoo the same day makes you look dumb
8,"&gt;lie down

&gt;try not to cry

&gt;cry a lot"
9,"I didnt know boobs kind of sag a little bit. For some reason I thought they'd be perfect domes and any sagging meant I looked old and gross. I probably looked great back then, I don't remember. Because what I did next was wear not one, but two bathing suit tops along with my bra for extra support. My mom didnt notice I needed new bras so I was a middle school kid with a C cup at least, wearing an A cup bra and two bathing suits to make it work. At one point it started to hurt like crazy every time I took off my layers, so I just wore them into the shower and washed them as well as I could. Pretty sure I wore those tops for over 6 months before I got the courage to live with the pain and ask for new bras. 

Talk to your kids people. Ask them regularly if something about their body is bothering them, or if they need new clothes. "
10,"Must have a desire for knowledge. 

Living in your own little world can be great, but wanting a better understanding of the world can be much more fulfilling.

I want someone who reads the news, cares about what's happening politically, listens to podcasts, watched documentaries, and who is willing to change their opinions on things based on justifiable data."
11,People who argue or play devil's advocate for sport. My brother in law is like this and I have no idea how my sister married him.
12,That it was a lot higher and front-er on the body than I thought it would be. The mechanics of sex started to make a lot more sense.
13,Decent pockets on all of our clothing. The pockets we do get are always shitty and they might as well not even be there most of the time. 
14,"""Holy crap it's....actually it's kind of ugly. But....kind of ugly-cute... like I'm not repulsed at all but... WTF it's twitching that's.....disturbing and fun at the same time.... This is a very confusing moment, I'm just gonna grab on and hope for the best."""
15,"No serious musicians. College boyfriend was a music theorist and early musician and he got us kicked out of two apartments because he fucking refused to stop practicing baroque guitar in the middle of the night. He didn't care that it interrupted my sleep, much less that it pissed off two landlords (in a row) enough to evict us. 

ETA: grammar "
16,A device that just sucks your period out of your body. I would love to have it over in a minute
17,"I ended a friendship for this too. She was of the ""explode and then carry on"" mentality, which I found super off putting. I forgave the first instance of her lashing out, but the second one put me over the line. Control your temper. Stress is not an excuse. 

I grew up in a yelling household and promised myself I'd never be in that situation again. "

19,"I worked the front desk/retail area as an asst. salon manager, if that counts.  I had no experience in hair, I came from a retail and administrative background. 

The salon is in a mall and we used to be closed Sundays and Mondays, but the company that owned the chain suddenly decided to open us for a few hours on Sunday afternoons. Because it was so new, it was staffed only with junior (fresh out of hair school) stylists, and nobody had anything scheduled for the first few weekends, and had to rely on walk-ins from mall customers. 

The second Sunday that we were open, we had 2 clients, a mom and daughter.  They waited out front on the couches in the mall hallway (rather than in our salon waiting area) and then came in when the stylists were ready. About 10 minutes later, both stylists came out to the front.  

Head lice!  On both of them.

Rather than buy the lice shampoo from a drug store, this lady thought it would be equally as effective to come into a salon for a quick wash and trim. 

Everybody basically freaked out. I didn't know fuck all about lice other than it being something you can ""catch.""  The junior stylists had never had experience with it either, and NONE of us had any training on how to handle the situation. I ended up turning away a couple of men's cuts while the team bleached the shit out of those stations, and called the mall office so they could clean the couches, except they roped off the whole corner and thus blocked off our shop entrance so potential customers couldn't even access the retail area.  

We couldn't get ahold of any of either of the store managers because it was a Sunday and we didn't have the Internet on the store computers (this was before iPhones) so we couldn't even look up what else we should do to make sure we were in the clear in terms of health &amp; safety or making sure the next clients to come in wouldn't contract lice.  While I was misinformed in how contagious lice is, thought I was acting in the best interest in both our clientele and the salon's reputation.

I got fired the next day for closing the store early, even though we were cordoned off by the mall."
20,"i was never successful, tbh. it felt like the guys would put up a charade for however long they needed to get what they wanted and split

but generally speaking, the guys who just wanted sex would put a lot less effort into trying to impress me, only tolerate proper dates for a short amount of time, and then resort to bait-and-switch tactics (''meet me for coffee at this address!'' and i'd show up at a fucking gas station on his route home)

low-to-no-effort seems to be the key! if i did it again, i would never agree to have any kind of ''chill'' (private) meeting for the first month. you wanna see me, it better be in public and we better be doing something fun to bond non-sexually"

23,"Ahh, the ol' PB&amp;J wipe..."
24,"I noticed awhile back that all of my black colored undies were getting bleach-like stains in the crotch area and smelled ammonia like. It freaked me out until I learned that it was pretty common with other women and caused by the pH levels of our discharge. I discontinued using Dr. Bronner's soap and the ""bleaching"" stopped. "

28,Fine.
29,"Pants sized using waist and inseam measurements! I'm always so jealous that my husband can pick out pants in 10 minutes, but I need to spend and hour figuring out if this new cut will fit me correctly. Also, they change the pant length and as someone who is on the extreme end of the height spectrum - this has a huge impact!"
30,"Making out with my boyfriend.  I figured just because he showed me his dick, it didn't mean I had full license to just grab at it.  So, I asked.  He said, ""of course"" and it was all good. 

"
31,"I always heard from sex ed teachers and doctors that were no big dead because the *total* volume of a period was ""about 2 tablespoons of blood"" and that PMS was a myth that some women used to get away with being nasty.  Meanwhile, I was overflowing overnight pads in a matter of hours and suffering from PMS-related cyclic depression that was so bad I wanted to kill myself.  I don't know where this ""2 tablespoons"" myth came from, but it's total bullshit!"

33,"Not terrible, but frustrating. I manage a small day spa and we had a guy come in for a 1 hour relaxation massage, he had never had a massage before. He specifically said he needed to relax. After the massage he came out and seemed annoyed and I asked what was wrong and he said ""I don't feel right."" I asked if he needed to sit down, did he need any water, no. He said he was ""too relaxed and didn't feel right"" and that his ""muscles felt too loose"". He was angry because he wanted to go play golf that afternoon and now he didn't think he would be able to. This man was mad at me for doing exactly what we advertised.. a RELAXATION massage. I'm very sorry that we did what we promised we would. "
34,"I walked into a salon and the chick who cut my hair was cut from the same cloth. I was like ""hey we have a lot in common. I like friends. Wanna be friends?"" and she was like ""omg thank god!

She stayed there till 2003, waiting for airplanes to fall out of the sky, and such.

37,"My mons pubis sticks out FUCKING FAR. Like so far... [like this NSFW](http://i.imgur.com/yx2rIdH.jpg).

This upset me to NO END when I was younger, I was very VERY insecure about it until I found out that it's actually p common. I also spent a large part of my life wandering around thinking I had a ""FUPA"", until I discovered that it actually is very bony and becomes more OBVIOUS when I am slimmer. Okay then.

40,"i think i just have a six sense for it. i can just kind of tell. like...

1. does he only want to meet when its convenient for him, and shows little regard for your own schedule

2. overt suggestive comments before its naturally progressed to that point (tbh i tend to chop off any guy who is suggestive before we have sex, lol, i'm quick to just be like ""oh yeah you're doing too much for me"" and block them)

3. its not my experience that a willingness to wait around necessarily means he is interested in more than sex. there have been guys circling me for years at this point who i'm certain just want to bone. its more about the quality of the time they've spent with you than the quantity.

4. that said, obviously the quicker he is to push for sex the more likely he is to primarily just want sex

5. sometimes you just have to look a guy up and down and ask yourself ""does he seem like a little shit?"" if he seems like a little shit, go with your gut, even if you dont have hard evidence. 

6. disappearing and then popping up again and then disappearing again = he just wants sex

41,"I have better stories from beauty school. I both worked and was a student at one. 

Rhonda is a bleach and tone. Rhonda likes to dispute the price. It starts at $55 and it's $15 for every extra 80g. So she gets her bleach blonde hair done for $70, instead of the hundreds of dollars it would cost elsewhere. I worked the front desk and Rhonda CRIED and SCREAMED at us that she never had to pay that before. Except this happened every time for half a year and we have extensive records of our guests including payment history, purchase history, color formulas, cut instructions, and even personality notes. 

Carmen came in every two weeks for her retouch. Most of our frequent guest we charge only product, but not her. She was such a negative human being! She was also a perfectionist. For the longest she insisted we add Splenda to the haircolor to keep it from irritating her scalp. Some color lines it works with, but it isn't necessary with ours. So we stopped doing it and unsurprisingly her scalp had no issues with the color. She also brought in her own paint brush to use instead of an actual color brush. And top of everything else she insisted upon blow drying her own hair. I never had her as a guest but I would have flipped my shit if she tried to touch anything of mine. I went through two hair dryers during beauty school as it was, I don't need a guest breaking it! She ended up getting banned for a waxing incident where she was verbally abusive to the student. 

Trisha is an old woman who likes to wear pants with rhinestones on them. She isn't terrible but she is very particular about which instructor is stationed with her chosen student. Well we've started a new thing to track instructor productivity so students have to stay in their designated bank of stations with that one designated instructor, and can't go off and find a different instructor. Any who Trisha was PISSED when we started enforcing this. My manager sweetly smiled and said if she wants that instructor so badly she can get a service with her wherever she works in salon and pay those prices, instead of $35 for all over color. 

Kim is a methhead who has been banned from services but still has gift cards so she is allowed to still purchase product. She has admitted in the past she gets the gift cards from drug sales or prostitution. She used her processing time to sell drugs over the phone. One time she came in and had $20 left on her card. She was about to buy some conditioner but wandered off to the makeup. Now she was so loud and kind of erratic so I just rang up her purchase and handed her the bag before she was even done shopping. I just wanted to get her out of there!!! She had open sores on her face and swore so much! 

Laura got banned because she is a racist and was verbally abusive to students and staff. She also liked to have a few too many beers before she showed up. She looked like a dark haired Michelle Dugger. Now a newbie accidentally booked an appointment for her after she had been banned so we honored that last appointment, except she called to say she was running late and when the receptionist told her we wouldn't have time for both color and cut if she ran late, she called her a fat donkey and all sorts of other names, and made her cry. Laura got extra banned. 

Alexa likes to decline the disposable panties for spa services and walk around with her robe open. She's beautiful but seriously put it away! She also tries to use multiple $5 off coupons at once. Alexa your manicure is already only $8! Get a grip! 

Edit: i really appreciated all the kind words! I used to be a creative writing major before I switched to becoming a hairstylist. I hope I can combine the two someday! "
42,"I found that verbalizing how I'm feeling helps. For example, if I come home from work cranky, I'll tell my boyfriend I'm feeling stressed about work and I just need a few minutes to wind down before we do anything. Once I've said it out loud I feel like I'm more aware of my actions after that and can recognize when I'm taking it out on someone else and immediately shut it down"
43,"&gt;I got fired the next day for closing the store early, even though we were cordoned off by the mall.

44,"""Can I touch it?""  I was really fascinated with it. "
45,"This probably could also be posted under a recent thread about the dirtiest person you know:

-In college we lived with a girl who I truly believe had some sort of mental disorder that caused her to be ridiculously disgusting. It's like she just didn't see the filth, or was missing the wherewithal to be bothered by it.

-She left used condoms, dildos, and (thankfully) negative pregnancy tests on the floor of her room. She often took in stray animals who would defecate or give birth on her carpet, sometimes the carpet in my room. When she cooked, I shit you not, it truly looked a bomb had hit our place. Food would sit in pans until it grew mold. Underwear, socks, and wrappers littered our common area.

-Once we were having a party and she was out of town, so we cleaned up the common area and moved her things out of sight. She was upset when she got back and wrote on her public diary (back when Facebook had those notes) things that she wished it was legal to throw people into an incinerator.

-The loud sex with her boyfriend shook the walls.

-The cherry on top of a slovenly sundae came when I went to use the bathroom we shared, and walked in to find a very used, opened, pad sitting on the lid of the toilet, sprawled in all its bloody glory."

My current boyfriend does not drum in our apartment at all. Him and his band rent out an actual studio to do that. When he makes music in the apartment, he does it with headphones on and his guitar plugged into the computer so only he hears it.

eta: I will say the super annoying thing about dating musicians is all the extra space you need to store their crap."
50,"I was working in a spa a few years ago, and I had a woman come in for a Brazilian wax. It's common courtesy to trim the hair down there to about an inch long before coming in for this type of waxing- it's less painful for the client, and easier on the waxer. I took her back to my treatment room, and her alone for a minute to get undressed. When I came back in the room, I noticed a pair of scissors had been taken out of one of my drawers and left on the counter (a drawer that was CLEARLY NOT MEANT for client use). They were office scissors, not meant for cutting hair and definitely not sanitized. When I went to lay down a strip of wax on the woman's lady-bits, I notice she's bleeding profusely. I asked her about it, and she said that she took the scissors out of the drawer to trim her hair for me. She had pulled the hair away from her body to cut it, but instead of cutting the pubes she accidentally CUT OFF THE ENTIRE CHUNK OF SKIN. Needless to say I let her know she wouldn't be getting waxed, and she left. I never heard from her again. "

91,"I suck at adult friends... So my SO and I started doing a monthly game night. We invite a bunch of our friends and acquaintances on Facebook (the people you talk to but never physically hang out with), we make a main dish, everybody contributes a side dish or drinks, and we hang out and play a game (Cards Against Humanity, Resistance, Exploding Kittens, Geek Out, etc).

We've been doing it for almost a year now and sometimes the location changes and somebody else hosts and invites new people. Now all of those old friends, new friends, and acquaintances (like that one mom from my son's hockey team or that couple we met at that one place) that we had on Facebook and only spoke to online have become real-life friends. It's been great and they're just as happy as we are to hang out once a month (if not more). "

I think she's the consummate politician and just a little bit... slimy.  I think she claims to have beliefs when it's helpful to her, such as her stance on marriage equality.  I honestly have no idea if she truly believes in marriage equality.  I suspect she does, but I don't know.  

However, I also think that she's very intelligent, hard working, and very diplomatic.  I think she would make an excellent president.  I guess you could say that I don't trust her in that I don't believe everything that she says, but I do trust her to be a good president.  I don't think I would voluntarily spend time with her or be her friend, but I don't look for that in a presidential candidate."

99,"It was fun, but we were both nervous. We spent the night having sex, eating, and then watching law and order as the sun came up. Our 10 year anniversary was a few weeks ago, and we watched law and order all night in memory of our honeymoon haha. Overall it was an A+ experience minus the nervousness and tiredness from the wedding. "
100,"As someone else with large areolas who had surgery to reduce the size...  Don't do it. 

It's my biggest regret in life, I was ashamed of my breasts before I had the surgery, now it's to the point where I don't even let anyone look at them. 

My areolas have grown back, and with the scarring you will get (you can tattoo over to make a new outline) it looks completely ridiculous. It's areola, new made up outline that's stretched with grown back areola mixed in one horrible package. 

They do warn you, but I was so obsessed about getting it done that I went ahead with it anyway. Now I'm saving up to have a second surgery, but it will be at least twice as much as they need to fix it and reduce them and as a mature student it's not easy to get that amount of money. 

I know you said no lectures and this isn't meant as one, it's just my experience and I wish someone had told me this before I went through with it. I understand your feelings, I have them too. Just don't end up in my situation, I don't wish that on anyone. "
101,"Sounds similar to mine. She started off with a bang when she asked to put her dancing pole in our living room. She had previously been kicked out of on-campus housing before and had mandatory psychiatric treatment. 

She had HPV and left condoms, tampons, vomit and blood (from cutting) all over our bathroom. She also didn't wear shoes in the shower, which is how you contract the particular kind of HPV she had. 

She had very loud sex and very loud fights with her boyfriend, who I saw naked more than once because he would shower and walk back to her room with no towel. He would have to walk across our living room and my bedroom door to do this. 

On one phone call after a confrontation between her and I, she said to her brother ""I don't think murder is necessarily wrong..."" 

The kicker was that she was bulimic and would binge on OUR food, and then purge IN HER ROOM INTO MY COOKWARE AND DISHES. I moved out the day after she carried a bowl full to the brim with vomit across my bedroom door into the bathroom, sloshed some of it on the floor and never cleaned it up. 

It was an actual hazmat zone, and I had health issues from the stress of living with her. Thank god I never contracted anything. That's only the tip of the iceberg with her too."
102,"Most of the men I've dated that were primarily interested in sex were way too pushy to not notice. We're kissing? Okay, cool. You're going for my boob already? Move his hand. Going for the pants now? He gets a stern no. Keeps it up? Get the f out."
103,"Tough love here: I was diagnosed and treated for social anxiety and I had a lot of similar thoughts. Finding the right therapist is a lot like finding the perfect hairstylist, it make take some work to find one that is a good fit. But a good therapist is not there to ""provide emotional support"" by validating everything you think. They are there to help you question and challenge negative beliefs that you assume are true. I've never met you, but I am confident that you are not single because of ""total social rejection"" (as you put it). Why? Because I used to feel adamantly the same way, and after therapy I know that kind of rejection doesn't even exist, it's in your mind! The people you encounter on a daily basis are not busy judging you, they are primarily caught up in thoughts about themselves and their own lives. I don't know what the ""deformities"" you refer to are. Believe me, people may notice but it is a blip on their radar. They are the main character in their own lives, not you.  

There are big and beautiful women, disabled women, heck, even just obnoxious women who still have loving (and in the latter case, I assume very patient) partners. If you bring your internal story about being unlovable, judged, and undesirable with you into your interactions with potential partners, your negative and defensive behaviour will turn it into a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

Some more tough love: no one is *owed* sexual attraction from anyone else. This attitude is what makes ""nice guys"" so disgusting: they treat women like sexual vending machines who are obligated to dispense sex to men in return for their ""niceness"". If you are bitter because you have yet to find someone who is attracted to you, a part of you believes that other people ""owe it to you"" to find you sexually attractive. They don't. All you can do is work with the body and attitude that you've got to try and be the best that you can be. 

From your comments, emotionally you are in a pretty dark place. I've been there. It probably feels like normality for you. ""Acceptance and self-esteem come from within, no one can give it to you"" probably sounds like bullshit told by attractive people to ugly people. But it is the truth. I strongly encourage you to commit to therapy (CBT is a great option) because life is too short to spend it suffering the way you are now. "

108,I'd like a spray on hair removal. Something that would dissolve the hair on my legs and armpits instantly without damaging my skin. I'd even do it daily if it meant I could completely avoid shaving forever. 
109,"I work in a big city, and I'm surrounded by hotels and airports. I see about 300 new faces each month on top of my regular clients, weddings, etc. I've been to Manhattan for classes, Nj, all over. Continuing education is so very important.

I can literally copy and paste my most difficult clients. Not even exaggerating, every single client I've ever had an issue with was the exact same person. Blonde, middle age, from Chicago/Houston/La, gets blow outs 3 times a week back at home, wants ""most straight with lots of body and texture in the layers"" blow out. Go. Run far away from me because you will not be happy with me.

I've had one throw a brush at me, one had me in tears because she said she could, ""smell my lack of confidence,"" and one laugh hysterically at me when I reiterated exactly her words back to her. 

Go. Away. "
110,"I've never had someone use me for sex although some have tried, this is what I've found that worked for me:

-Does he mention sex very early on? Is he full of sexual innuendos? Stay away from guys who advertise sex as a priority. Focus on ones who are interested in getting to know you and doing activities with you.

-This is personal but I stayed away from guys who were very physically touchy from the get-go. I feel like this is contradictory because my SO and I made out after our first date/meet after meeting 2 days prior on OKC. But he was really respectful during the date (long) and we talked for hours about so many things, not sex, and he was not super flirty. He listened to what I was saying from the get-go.

-My boyfriend and I were very familiar (he came over to my place, etc) a lot in the beginning but we waited a month to have sex. I wanted to wait and he was fine with it. Why did I wait? Because I wanted to be sure he was worth my time. Bring up waiting, in person, not text, and watch his reaction. Is he annoyed? Does he laugh it off?

-I don't like charmers, guys who are very flirty, very charming, always know ""just want to say"". Don't focus on charm. Focus on authenticity. Find someone who has interests, a life, worries, goals, fears, and is willing to talk it over and share with you. Men who want to get you into bed ASAP are usually not ""real"". They are saying what you want to hear. Authentic men are themselves and yes, they will not always say what you want to hear but it's fine because I'd rather have someone imperfect and authentic than someone perfect and fake.

-YMMV, but in my younger years (18-early 20s, college) I stayed away from guys my own age for a while because I found that 18 year old men were just horny beyond reason and were not looking for a relationship. You will find old horndogs who will and can use you for sex but keep in mind, a lot of young guys may do the same. Consider the age of the man in question and where he is in life, what he is seeking from it. **Someone who is partying regularly, doesn't have his life together, and has untreated mental problems is not someone you want to build a LTR with**

I'm 26 and all of the guys I've had sex with were guys I had relationships with. I think part of that is luck and part of that is just not falling for charmers and guys who say what they think you want to hear. There's a lot of them out there. Be careful."
111,"I hate how it feels on my skin, I don't want to spend the money or time, and it's inconvenient. I have a good skin care regimen of course, and always put moisturizer/SPF on before I leave my apartment but otherwise, no make up. "
112,"I would use ""attractive ugliness"" to describe a vagina, like ""...wtf is this shit?...I want to stick my penis in it"".We're self-conscious animals, and nature can be dirty and weird."
113,"I guess I never thought I'd be alone forever but social anxiety coupled with being overweight my whole life did result in a lot of loneliness. I lost my virginity at 25 to a guy who liked fat women but couldn't handle what other people thought of him for it. I'm not ugly or super huge, he was just an asshole and I had low self esteem so I settled for that shitty relationship for five years. 

Then I realized I'd rather be alone for the rest of my life than spend another second with someone I fucking hated. I got back in meds for the anxiety, moved to a new neighborhood, got a dog, met my now best friend and decided to try dating again. It sucked and I almost gave up but I was ok otherwise. 

But then... I met the man who is now my husband and not only does he love me and my body and all my flaws, he's proud to be my husband. 

If the worst thing about you is the way you look or a disability that you struggle with, I'd say that's alright really. I don't know if there's someone out there for everyone. I hope there is. "
114,"They're called a ""suction"" D&amp;C or vacuum/manual aspiration and are still used (in Canada at least) for abortions before ~15 weeks depending on the provider. They have to be done under sedation, you still bleed a bit after, the dilation part to open the cervix is essentially artificial labor contractions, and with each procedure there's a risk of puncturing the uterus and/or permanent scarring ([Asherman's syndrome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asherman%27s_syndrome)) preventing you from ever having children. Not a great add on to a spa day!

If you just don't want a period, there's hormonal IUDs, continuous BC, [endometrial ablation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrial_ablation), and of course hysterectomy.

My medical bills came to just under $18k, and I'm still paying them off two years later.  Pregnancy #2 will only be about $3500 total thanks to Obamacare being in full effect now and covering a lot more!  Neither includes the monthly health insurance premium of about $700 both times.  "
117,"Yes so many women (especially larger chested women) seem to believe that their breasts are saggy because they don't float magically in midair. But to me they don't look saggy at all, just normal. Gravity makes them hang down a bit, it's natural."

119,"Lived with a guy for three months as part of a sublet. He was a friend of a friend, I needed somewhere to live badly, and we hit it off right away.

It was alright for about two weeks, then things started falling apart. Zach was one of the least hygienic people I've ever met. He showered, sure, but he rarely did laundry. His bedroom was full of piles and piles of dirty clothes, and he never washed his sheets. If he left the door open to his room, at the back of the unit, I could smell it as soon as I walked in the front door.

He ate off my dishes and used my pots and pans to cook, but literally did dishes *one* time in the whole three months, and even then he only washed half the dirty dishes and left the rest in a sink of cold soapy water for me to finish. A month after that, I asked him to please wash one pot out for me since he left cheese crusted on it, and he flipped his shit complaining that he JUST washed dishes (a month prior).

He was also financially insolvent. He had a job, but he was always broke and pawning his things. When he ran out of his stuff to pawn, he started pawning things that belonged to the girl we were subletting from. When he ran out of that, he asked if he could pawn some of my shit, and I said no.

But the real kicker to all of this was that this guy had a kid, a 6 year old daughter. He didn't have custody, but sometimes had her on weekends, coming over and staying in his total sty of a bedroom. When Kiddo was over, his idea of spending time with her was to turn on Cartoon Network and sit on the couch by her, playing on his phone. She usually got bored and would come find an excuse to get into my room instead, and I'd play with her or go outside with her. Zach had no idea how to entertain a kid, or how to feed a kid either. Every time she came over he fed her nothing but cheese pizza and yogurt and gatorade, even though he knew that at home with her mom she ate mostly vegan. Then he was totally at a loss when she started feeling gross from eating so much dairy and threw up on the kitchen floor. "
120,"Sure. 

Made me feel like he never really gave a damn in the first place. Which I guess was kind of the case, since he'd been sleeping with her for the entirety of our relationship."
121,"""Uhhh, how do I...interact with it? C-can I touch it? Will I hurt it? Oh it's weird."" "
122,"Sometimes after sex, my boyfriend will go ""hey babe.. babe look, look at this"" and I'll look over and he just has the most smug grin on his face while his halfhard dick is bouncing on top of him. He also does it inside me before pulling out after sex sometimes when I'm just lying on top of him trying to catch my god damm breath because he knows it freaks me out. And is a surefire way to get me off of him in half a millisecond."
123,"I've been told that at 22, it's unreasonable that I don't find a point dating people who are dead set against kids.  I have gone through periods on being dead set for kids and kind of on the fence, but I don't want the option taken from me.

I really don't like yelling, that comes from my father growing up, he yells constantly and it terrifies me.  Like yelling makes me immediately cry.

My version of lying is probably a bit broader than most people from what I've been told, and lying is a huge deal breaker for me.

132,"Ah when I was in school I had many stories. A few stick out. 

A mom brought her daughter in, she was maybe 12-15 yrs old and told us she wanted her hair bleached. As one of my fellow students applied the bleach, suddenly bugs started crawling manically on her head, girl was infested with lice and her damn mom brought her in thinking the bleach would kill it, without informing us of it. We immediately sent them out the door, bleach still in her hair and had to shut down the school the rest of the day to clean and sanitize everything. 

One woman screamed at me in pain anytime I barely touched her hair, saying I was being too rough. It was just incredibly stressful and drawn out because of that. 

There are some really nasty rude people that want to get their hair done, it can really beat you down. But there are amazing clients as well and ones that you'll never forget.

I just want to share one I won't ever forget. A woman comes in to the school to get her hair done, I'm chosen to take her. She sits down and starts telling me her daughter use to go to the same school during the day classes (I was evening). The more she talks, I realize her daughter was the girl from my school who was recently accidentally shot in the head by her boyfriend, which killed her. She didnt finish school because of it and it was a really sad time. Her mom told me I'm the first person since her daughter to do her hair, she shared so many pictures and stories of her daughter with me and we laughed and we cried together while I was doing her hair. I didnt know her daughter, but by the time her appointment was over I felt like I knew her so well. I just felt so bad for this poor woman, it was by far the most heart wrenching client I've ever had. I cried for an hour after she left. It's hard to tell if it was a good or bad experience, but I felt honored to be the first one to do her hair since her daughter. "

156,What situation were you in that you saw an erect penis for the first time ever and didn't think it was appropriate to touch it?
157,"I have small boobs and somewhat large areolas (about 2 inches). They're fairly common among women who are older or who have had children. Considering I don't fit into either of those categories and I'm not overweight, cosmetic/plastic surgery is my best bet. It's something I've been contemplating since I was like 12, so I've given it plenty of thought and I'm not looking for lectures.

But on another note, I've always struggled with ridiculously terrible periods. From my very first period I dealt with excruciating cramps that would cause to blackout, but not before I would vomit+have diarrhea. When I searched online or read Seventeen Magazine, I always just assumed I had really bad cramps, and that it was normal to experience cramps several days before your period. 

But finally I went to my gyno and she confirmed what my mom thought: I have endometriosis. Well she hasn't confirmed it because I haven't had a laparoscopy, but I have the symptoms and my aunt has it as well. I've heard of many women having similar symptoms and their doctors brushing it off as them having bad periods.

**EDIT**: I'm not trying to be a jerk, but this has nothing to do with what men like, or yalls thoughts/opinions/experiences with surgery. I'm sorry you all feel that way but I'm not going to base my decisions off of what people on the internet say. Thanks though."

161,"I think that she was born for politics, and sometimes shows it through her decisions - good and bad. She is more moderate than I'd like, but you know what? America, when averaged out, is a pretty moderate place. It's not how I see myself - I was pretty much totally behind Bernie - but I've really come to appreciate the fact that Hillary's a bright lady who genuinely walks the walk just as much as she talks the talk.

I also think that there is literally no choice she's ever made, no thing she's ever done, no personal feelings she's ever had evolve, that has not been raked over the single largest pile of coals EVER. Wear a pantsuit? TOO MANLY. Wear a dress? CANKLES. Actively change her political beliefs, like so, so many other people do? WHAT A FLIP-FLOPPER. Be ambitious? FUCK THAT LADY. Not smile or speak with verve? HOW DARE SHE? Like, she can't win - this is just further proof that absolutely no woman can truly have it all.

I was scrubbing a floor in a classroom and I fell, said I was okay, got laughed at, and then grabbed onto a shelf in a cubby on the wall to get up. My legs slid out from under me and I fell again, except I fell mostly on my face. My glasses fell off and I went to say that I was okay but my teeth were in the way and I realized I'd fucked up. Then I saw the blood on the floor. I stood up and my boss grabbed my shoulders and literally just slid me out of the room.

Telling people I broke my face just falling on it normally has them looking at me like I must've been drunk or some shit but no the floor was just mad slippery.

Edit: I should note that I broke my maxilla and chipped one of my teeth. My dentist had to manually move four teeth back into place and I wore a splint (braces from canine to canine) for a month, at which point she filed my teeth in some areas so I could close my mouth (they are now further back than they used to be) and also I will need at least three root canals at some point soonish."
172,"I never get sick of him.  Being around people wears me out, but when I'm around him I'm just so happy and comfortable. We've been together 11 years and I still look forward to seeing him every day. "
173,I sometimes feel like the only person I know who is a huge Logan fan. 
174,"Vegan here. I eat anywhere others do. Unless it's an Italian or authentic Mexican restaurant, I'll find stuff to eat. I don't expect the group's plans to change based on my diet. Worst case scenario, I order a drink and say I'm just there to enjoy the company (which is true--I have plenty of awesome food at home and only eat out for the social aspect)."
175,"How *kind* he is. Not in a ""Nice Guy"" way. He genuinely cares about other people, even when they don't deserve it. He'd give anyone the shirt off his back, or offer them help with whatever they need. And he's so sweet and gentle with kids and animals it makes me melt. "
176,"I really disliked Lane x Zac and my least favourite thing about the show was her getting married, HATING sex (and that never getting resolved as far as I can remember) and then getting pregnant with twins. I thought it was just such a cop out for her story and to character. She was supposed to be a rock star but now she's stuck in Stars Hollow being a mother, it just didn't seem like Lane at all."
177,"For starters porn viewing never felt natural to me. It wasn't something I enjoyed.
In one of my first relationships I had an ex who would talk about pornstars, would bring up comparisons between me vs them, and would always try to force me to watch it with him. I never asked him to stop, but it took a terrible toll on me when I was younger.

Fast forward to my current relationship. Long story short, he stopped having sex with me daily (we went from every day to maybe once a week), and I asked him why, he never gave me an answer. I asked if he was watching porn and he told me yeah, which instantly ruined our intimate life for a long period of time and absolutely killed my self esteem. Again I was faced with porn in a relationship, and this time I really noticed how to me: I couldn't handle it. I told him, and he ""stopped"", only to admit in a breakdown 6 months later he never stopped.

It feels worse than cheating, because it is but isn't. I stopped looking at other naked people because I got into a relationship, and gave my self 100% body and mind intimately to my partner, when they couldn't do the same. It feels like it isn't me and him, there's someone else in the room to turn to for his needs, and he'll choose it over me sometimes. It's a HORRIBLE feeling to me.

I get a lot of flack because even here I get the same comments like: ""wow you must really like getting lied to"", but in reality there are many many people who also think porn is damaging to relationships. 

Sorry, I really just wanted to explain myself and give you a thought out reply.
TL;DR:  to me it feels like cheating, so it's a deal breaker."
178,"This isn't as bad as others probably, but my second ever roommate was the worst. She was narcissistic and was also someone who ""didn't believe in taking medicine""...for anything. As you can imagine, that caused a lot of problems in the freshly incubating bacteria wasteland that is Freshmen college dorms.


Before she moved in with me, she brought scabies to the entire dorm building. Her roommate wanted her out so bad, so she got bunked with me instead when my original roommate moved out to live at home &amp; commute.


Her friends would come over and sit on my bed while I wasn't there, so I would have to ask them to move when I would get home. They would bang on the door at 2AM every weekend like drunken jerks. She would literally always lose her key but didn't want to buy a new one so she would LEAVE OUR DOOR UNLOCKED when she left so she could get back in. I would lock it at night and when she came back at 3AM, I would ignore her banging on the door and pretend I was soooooo sound asleep.


I am a person who never gets sick. Like, ever. For the first time since I was 5 I had gotten very, very sick out of nowhere. Somehow I had gotten scarlet fever right before leaving for Thanksgiving break. Honestly, I blame her for it, based on all of the other medical issues she brought to the dorms and her lack of wanting medical attention.


She wanted us to be best friends, but I couldn't stand her personality. She only talked about herself, and when people were talking about fun things, she would always redirect it back to her somehow even if it wasn't relevant. People got really fed up with her really fast. Not only did we live together, but we had *every* single college class together as well. I wanted to die. I was so happy when she dropped out of college to go live back in Long Island."
179,"When they don't want to go on dates. Just wants you to 'come chill at my place'

Maybe the first ever time you meet them (from say tinder) might be on a date... But it would usually be something low key like a bar.

If he never mentions doing anything else with you besides chilling at his, he's in it for sex.
"
180,"""Laura got extra banned.""
LOL!! Love it!"
181,"That is a huge safety risk to go over at a guy's house on the first date especially if you don't know them well. Meeting in a public place with your own mode of transportation is usually standard. Personally, I prefer something very casual like coffee or a drink as a first date so neither party is stuck in a long time commitment if things go sour."
182,$18K?! To have a baby. That is insane. 
183,"Your comment makes me very happy, because I've been single for a while now and I'm starting to feel like I'm at this point. I like myself, I enoy being on my own. A relationship would add to my life but I'm not lacking without one because I'm enjoying the benefits of being on my own right now. 

 I'm glad someone else sees it like this too. Thank you :)"
184,"Yes!

And good for you, it's generally a good idea to avoid long distance relationships.  Go date people where the gyms measure in kilos."
185,"This is the exact opposite of my reaction the first time I encountered a vagina, so that's pretty interesting. The mechanics suddenly made sense to me because I found out it was a lot lower and more towards the back than I expected."
186,Staying in a relationship too long. I should have broken up with one ex after about two years but we ended up being together for seven years.

190,OH MY GOD THIS IS HORRIFYING
191,"I worked in a little punk rock salon on a large university campus, so we had quite the variety of people come in. There was the guy who came in high as balls on who knows what who got his hair colored blue and orange. When it was all complete, he asked his stylist if she would also color his pubes blue and orange. She declined. 

I had way crazier people in beauty school though. My school wasn't in a great neighborhood, so we got a lot of trashy clients. It's noteworthy that I was homeschooled and therefore super awkward at 18. One of my very first clients was thrilled to tell me that she had just gotten out of prison and was giving herself a makeover to celebrate. I think I just mumbled something along the lines of ""that's nice"" and didn't know what to say for the rest of haircut. 

I also had an elderly black woman throw a screaming tantrum that I had been assigned to do her hair, because she didn't think a white girl would be able to do her hair. She ended up walking about because the instructor wouldn't reassign students. 

I think my worst story from beauty school was my first kids haircut. First off, I don't really like kids and I don't have much experience with them. With the luck of the draw, my first kids cut was on a six year old boy with cerebral palsy. The poor little guy couldn't control his movements, and while I was trying to trim around his ear, he involuntarily jerked and for the first (and only) time, I nicked a client. I felt so bad, I started crying in the middle of the haircut and the instructor had to finish his hair. I think it scarred me forever on kids cuts lol. 

I ended up getting a degree and I work in insurance now..."
192,"More penetrative sex toys that look nothing at all like penises! All the ones that feel best to me have an entirely different shape. 

Not to get too graphic but my ex did this thing with her hand, and I would KILL for a toy shaped like that.

People need to think outside the box a bit more, no pun intended. "
193,"Sure, I guess. If you really think that's best."
194,Bad hygiene and not knowing how to dress. My parents were very strict about it when I was growing up. My dad would straight up tell me to go change if my hair wasn't neat and my outfit was a mess. I can't really date someone who prefers not to shower and doesn't care about what he looks like.
195,"I started dating my ex-fiance when I was 17. Got engaged when we were 21. A few months before the wedding, my mother died suddenly and I couldn't go through with it so I called it off, but we stayed together. People were very understanding.

Bought a house and moved out of state. Ex became increasingly abusive and eventually I had to flee after the final, intense, physical altercation. I had to couch surf and sleep in my car for a while and it was brutal. Not marrying him was one of the best decisions I ever made; it would have been so much harder for me to leave otherwise. 

It's been years since then and I've never been happier. "

I wouldn't date a muslim. I grew up muslim and am sick of having that religion as a part of my life.

edit: guys I get it, you wouldn't date someone who believes in any religion because you think it's mumbo jumbo. But I wish you wouldn't compare your reasons to my reason, which is that islam has been used to psychologically and emotionally harm me personally. I don't hate people who follow religion, and I wouldn't be opposed to dating people who have religion."

2- Had a guy throw money at me to pay because I'm female...  So I threw his change back at him.  He was actually confused as to why I did so... 

3- A guy sat very crooked and asked for a mohawk then asked me if I can cut straight lines (attitude biker kind of guy)... So I replied with ""Of course!  It'll be an even straighter mohawk if you sit up straight like the grown-ass man you're supposed to be."" He wasn't amused but he sat up straight and let me do my job.  I heard snickers from my coworkers who thought I was ballsy to speak to a client that way.  

Don't mess with me,  man! 

I'm writing a book on my career because it's endless.  98% awesome tho. The bad stories are rare, they just stand out. "
206,"There's also a dearth of study into (and education about) female-specific medical issues in general.  For example, something like 1 in 20 women has recurrent yeast infections and there is literally no treatment except taking antifungals until the issue magically fixes itself, which could take decades.  And then there are issues like endometriosis which your average GP apparently has no clue about so women who are passing out from pain on a regular basis during their periods are brushed off and told to take ibuprofen.  It's really a travesty."
207,no self esteem/boundaries is a helluva drug. i told myself that it was a compliment that he wanted me so much that he forgot we had a date.

212,"I live in Utah right now and every time that statistic comes up I have a good laugh about it.  At first I was like, ""Why are they paying for it?  There's more than enough porn that doesn't cost anything"".  And then I realized that they're not allowed to look at porn, and that's probably well monitored while they still live at home (all the Mormon parents I've run into have the most intense online monitoring systems that I have ever seen for their children).  So somewhere between 18 and 22 when they get married and move out they've had no exposure to porn, but know it exists, so of course when they start searching for it they just assume that the pay sites are the only option.  Most kids start looking for porn before they have money that's usable online, and before they can legally buy porn at a sex shop, so they have to go through the effort to find the free stuff (and the effort of hiding that they've found the free stuff).  It's not a lot of effort for even mildly tech savvy kids, but having to pay for it isn't a barrier for someone with a credit card, so the adults don't have the same motivation to make the effort to find the free stuff.      "

215,Legal and easier to obtain abortions covered by healthcare. Better access to birth control. Better menstrual products. Better understanding and acceptance of menstrual issues - from cramps and discomfort to things like endometriosis.

219,I had a Bartholin's (spelling?) cyst when I was around 12 up until I was about 18. I never told anyone because I thought that it was caused by God knowing I masturbated. Turns out they're pretty common and cysts in general are common.

229,"Disclaimer: I don't have kids. But I work as a teacher in a heavily female workplace with lots of young 20 somethings who have given birth. My fiancé and I are going to attempt to get pregnant starting this December. 

Most teachers try to plan their delivery to be late in the spring, so that they have the summer to bond with their kiddos since we're off. But not all of them do. That's not always something you can plan, and for my fiance and I, we'd rather give birth in the fall so that our children will be the oldest they can be and still be in x grade. Developmentally, it's easier on the child. 

So, the Family Medical Leave Act, which covers pregnancy and birth, says that I can take six weeks off of work for illness, injury or childbirth and not lose my job. That doesn't mean I get paid. It just means that I don't lose my job. I'm planning on hoarding my vacation time from this year so that if I can get pregnant this winter like I'd like to, I'll have three weeks of paid vacation to take off when the baby is born. That only means I'll be unpaid for three weeks. Being a middle class person with a decent salary, I'll simply be saving this year for that loss of income. 

My mother plans on moving in with us for three months after the baby is born, to help with childcare. We're extremely grateful that she's got the vacation time to actually do that. She may need to work one day a week or so, but my fiancé can work from home one day a week, so we've got that covered. After three months, our baby will go to day care. My fiancé works at a university that has a child development lab, so we'll have priority in getting in there. They do research on normal child development, and also educational experiments regarding language development and stuff for babies. Older kids get all kinds of neat experimental reading and math programs. This will be in addition to normal schooling, so it can't do anything except help. Plus it's free for employees. It's a very sought after arrangement. 

My finance's insurance covers all prenatal care 100%, and 80% of all the costs of the birth. In total, we researched and it should cost us around $4000 to have a baby if there are no complications. 

I'm lucky. I've got a good salaried job, as does my fiancé, with very good insurance paid for mostly by my employer. I have paid time off. I have family that can and will support and help us through this difficult transition. 

Many American women are not so lucky. I don't know how a single mom with no familial support working minimum wage with no insurance handles it. 

Edit: FMLA allows for 12 weeks unpaid leave, not 6. Also, a lot of people sign up for ""short term disability insurance"" when they are planning on getting pregnant. It'll pay some or all of your lost wages due to maternity leave. "
230,"I used to work as a salon receptionist, but I do still have some stories.

Gloria was an extremely snotty woman who always bragged about how much money she had and how she could afford such nice things, but at the same time she would always try and haggle to get a lower price on her services. She had a Louis Vuitton handbag that she told us all the time how expensive it was. Our manager, who collected high end handbags and knew a lot about them, told us Gloria's LV bag was a fake! She could tell from the stitching or something I guess. After that I always hated Gloria even more because she was such a phony. 

Alfonzo was a walk in client who looked and smelled like he hadn't washed his hair in weeks. He was going on about all sorts of conspiracy theories about big businesses and then when it came time to pay, he tipped the stylist with oxy! He was banned from the salon after that. 

Patti had an insane amount of hair, very thick and coarse and down to her lower back. She would come in for her services late constantly and would complain if the stylist took (what she considered to be) too long. She expected to get an all over color and cut in under an hour from the time her appointment was supposed to start even if she was 15 minutes late. Even though the stylist told her before hand, she would always argue about the extra fee we would charge for long hair. The final straw was when she had a huge screaming fit when it was time to pay, and told her stylist he was ruining her life and that she hoped he caught HIV and died. She wasn't allowed to make appointments after that. "

A few drinks &amp; joints in we start talking about our experiences in this country and he mentions something about how difficult teaching can be...Now, I was drinking, but I wasn't drunk. It's totally possible that he was in school and teaching at the same time, so I asked how long he had left until he graduated. The confused look on his face was priceless. I could see the exact moment where he realized he was a ""med student"". He said he had about a year left and quickly moved on to asking me if I felt good enough to go to his place because he had a really comfy bed that I can rest on until I'm sober enough to go home. That guy sucked."

You'd assume all the practice they get would make them better, but they keep pedaling irrelevant *gotcha* bullshit for the sole purpose of getting an emotional response out of people as a part of some kind of power trip. The people who understand that there is a time and place to play the devil's advocate are able to play the role with tact and an understanding of nuance. They actually do a good job at presenting other sides to an idea. The ones who do it for sport are just trying to pass off stirring the shit pot as something else and they're fooling nobody (but aren't clever enough to see it). "
235,"actually, it went way worse! i wasn't too familiar with the area (i'm an immigrant and maps are confusing), and he said that there was a cafe near me that we could meet up at. i went there, and he called asking where i was, and he said i had gone to the wrong one and he was coming to get me

my apartment was literally on the drive between the two points, and he conveniently ''forgot'' that we were supposed to go on a date and drove me home :| i should have thanked him for the ride home and told him to fuck off, but instead insisted on getting a date, had a super-sad gas station coffee-drinking while he impatiently kept asking if we were done, and THEN let him take me home for sex.

258,"When I was young it was before the days of internet. I thought that all vaginas were literally just holes since that's all those diagrams ever show them as. I thought because my opening wasn't just some hole, that my vagina was growing partially out of the opening and something was wrong with me. I went over the conversation in my head with my doctor about how I had a growth out of my vagina, until I saw a porn magazine for the first time and was extremely relieved. "
259,"Oh my god this worried me too. When I got my first boyfriend, I was 13 and he was 14. He had yet to grown a happy trail and he complained about it a bit, but I already had one and I was soooo embarrassed that I had more body hair than my boyfriend. "
260,"I think Hillary Clinton is, honestly, a devoted public servant who legit wants to make peoples' lives better. She's also secretive, bitter, and dismissive towards the press and at times the public, largely due to being disproportionately attacked and hounded for 30+ years. (This woman wanted to keep her last name in her marriage, and changed it when Bill started running for office in Alabama and people were successfully attacking and judging him over *her last name*.)

I think she's not allowed the space and appreciation to be a complicated human that male politicians much more frequently get. Nor are her mistakes forgiven nearly as easily. (All I wanted to do during Biden's speech the other night was get in fb arguments with all the Bernie supporters I saw fawning over him. I actually love Biden, but I also love Hillary. These folks apparently love Biden but hate Hillary, even though Biden HELPED WRITE AND WAS THE LEAD SPONSOR OF THE 1994 CRIME BILL THEY WON'T STOP BLASTING HILLARY FOR SUPPORTING. The two people have had almost the EXACT same policies the last 20 years.)

I admire her career, her determination, and her wonkishness. I do fundamentally like her as a person. And I'm really excited and hoping she'll be our first female president."
261,"This is one of my husband's more difficult traits. Sometimes, I JUST WANT TO TALK! Not everything is a competition or an invite to be all ""well, actually...."" Like, just let it go FFS. He's working on it, but I sometimes find myself not telling him mundane things for fear that it'll be a situation where I'm on the defensive. Point being, I get that! It can be a, uh, difficult thing to overcome when you're dating/ hanging out with that person, especially if they have no intention of working on it"
262,This seems like more a problem of character than a problem with musicians.
263,"Met the ""man of my dreams"" and was engaged in six months. Chose to do a long engagement to wait out him getting out of the military and moving to my city 2 hours from his base. He moved to my home two years later, couldn't find a job, and I was supporting him financially. Bought him a vehicle. Paid his child support. 

Four months before the wedding, I found out he has (another) child making 3 with 3 different mothers. He didn't plan to tell me because he was ""embarrassed."" Went to counseling, worked through it. 

One month before the wedding, I caught him cheating on me, in our home, while I was at work and he was supposed to be looking for a job. I called off the wedding, but sadly, wasted 2 more years on that dude.

Thank goodness I finally stood up for myself. It was the best decision I ever made. Now i'm in a relationship with someone who loves me, respects me, and I never have to worry about his fidelity. I hope to marry him some day. The quote ""don't marry a man unless you'd be proud to have a son just like him"" comes to mind."

268,"&gt;I know I need to try to go out more but I feel so shy going alone that I never go. 

I used to be like that, but then I realized that **I don't give a flying fuck what people think.** Who cares if people judge you for going out alone? And honestly, fuck those people. Those people are shitty, miserable assholes that you wouldn't want to hang out with anyway. So fuck it! Go out and do stuff because *you want to* and that's all the justification you need. Even if you don't meet anyone, go out and enjoy yourself. You only live once.

269,"My husband is the same as OP. Will not tolerate me yelling at him. My family are yellers. I grew up with my heart on my sleeve, lots of tone variation, dramatic, and yelling when mad.

270,"It's not stupid at all. Idioms are confusing if you haven't encountered them before. Cut from the same cloth just means that two people or things are more similar than dissimilar.

271,"I try to take an objective look on the situation and see if it's really a big deal ordinarily. I repeat to myself, ""I'm upset because ____"" and nine times out of ten, it sounds silly to me. If it sounds silly, I try to let it go."
272,"&gt;I honestly have no idea if she truly believes in marriage equality. I suspect she does, but I don't know. 

Personally, I would like to think that she believes in marriage equality.  People are allowed to change their opinions.  My SO's grandma (around the same age as Hillary Clinton) was very opposed to marriage equality at one time.  But as time passed, her opinion changed.  The world around her became more open to the idea and then her granddaughter came out so she is pro marriage equality now.  

I get a little grumbly when people accuse her of being a flip flopper on that stance when [in 1996, only 27% of the population was supportive of gay marriage.](http://www.people-press.org/files/2012/02/2-16-12-C-1.png)  A whole lot of people have changed their minds in a fairly short amount of time but I guess we can keep pointing fingers at one person."
273,I rest a bowl of popcorn on my tits and eat it by just sticking my tongue in the bowl and picking up whatever sticks. 
274,"So, a week ago there was a thread about ""unusual deal breakers"" and I mentioned that I don't date people who don't either bench more than me, or don't get awkward or insecure about benching less than me.  I mentioned the number because it's a very large segment of the population who fits into this category.

I got crossposted to another subreddit, where a bunch of dudes dug through hours of my youtube videos (including completely unrelated-to-lifting promos) for proof that I ""didn't really bench that much"" or that ""it doesn't count because it's geared"" or whatever.

There are so, so, so many dudes that get so, so, so insecure about the idea that a woman could even *possibly* be stronger than them, that they have to prove that she's not.  That they have to undermine my accomplishments, or tear me down.  Or at the very least, just feel embarrassed and shitty about something that I'm really proud of.

I can understand with our culture of toxic masculinity how a man could feel really awkward and crappy about being physically weaker than the woman he's dating.  But after having boyfriends curse me out in the middle of a gym for sharing advice that he asked for, or getting called a ""know it all bitch"" for claiming to know something about a topic I won a world championship in, I've realized that I don't have the energy in my life to deal with that.  I can understand those emotions, but I can not be the person to help you process them.  I'd rather spend my time with people who don't have to go through a bunch of mental gymnastics to be ok with the things that I really like about myself."

277,"Someone who can't acknowledge and talk about their emotions. My first boyfriend presented an ""unemotional"" facade, totally bottled up his emotions, refused to talk about it (even when it was super obvious he had a problem, like he would ignore me, snap at me etc.) and said nothing was bothering him, and eventually grew to distance himself from me. 

When we finally broke up, he ranted for around 10-15 minutes about everything he didn't like about me, and everything that he thought was wrong about the relationship. It was a lot to take in, and now I just prefer someone who is able to vocalise a problem out loud and talk things through if there's an issue."

280,"My favorite everything is just Kirk. I love his little pops of weirdness throughout the show, he never failed to make me laugh and he was really quite sweet!  I really loved when he got together with Lulu and just couldn't stop talking about the fact that he has a girlfriend."
281,Silent sex is weirdly off putting. I totally agree with that but I find some people don't even realise they are doing it.
282,"This is not my least favorite, but it's the one that gets the most flack from my friends - I really don't like Luke and Lorelai. I think they're a terrible couple, and while they have good chemistry with an ultimately satisfying ""finally!"" kiss, they don't really work. They don't have much in common, they suck at communication, and they just don't seem to have much fun together. Don't even get me started on the April nonsense (oh, that is probably my least favorite story line). 

Controversial opinion number two - I think that Lorelai and Chris actually make the most sense together. They have a ton in common and have a delightful back and forth. Their eventual marriage was a terrible plot line in a bad season, yes, but their breakups always seem contrived. 

Also, I fucking love Emily Gilmore, even when I'm not supposed to. "
283,"I thought that too--that it was just a plain, nondescript hole like a nostril or something.

287,"Pretty much all of them, but the last one takes the cake. The one who made me get my own place.

This girl had been living in the apartment before, so most of the furniture was hers... therefore, she thought of the apartment as hers as well, and the other roommate and I just rented rooms. Since the apartment was ""hers"", she never bothered to tell us when she was going to have people (often with pets) over, it was normal to get home and have a party going on, or 10 girls getting ready for an event, or 15 random people watching a game, making *a lot* of noise and drinking (my) beer, or just a bunch of people smoking pot (which I hate). She also ""decorated"" it the way she liked, which meant stuff like gluing pictures from magazines to the walls, putting an espresso machine (that only she was allowed to use) in the middle of the living room, keeping a giant dead plant, picking up stuff from the trash, like huge, moldy and warped Bob Marley posters, and even bringing home filthy traffic cones. I tried to make the place a little nicer by buying an orchid for the living room, which she promptly hid and replaced with a red candle on a wine bottle, making it look like Dracula's place. Every day I'd come home dreading what I would find when I walked into the apartment.

One day she called me and told me her old roommate (and best friend), whose room I had taken when she moved out to live with her boyfriend, was single again and wanted to move back in. I protested and she replied ""this isn't your choice, we've already decided it. You're gonna have to move out."" Since there was no lease, there was nothing I could do, and at this point I didn't really want to live there anyway, so I found a studio apartment and moved out three weeks later. I'm much, much happier now.

.

Edit: For those saying I should have sued: we didn't have any legal contract. The owner died and her daughter wanted to rent out the apartment, but couldn't because of some paperwork (her mother didn't leave a will or something). So she just rented us the place with no contract, no real estate agency, no nothing; we'd transfer her the money every month and that was it. Even if I could have legally done something, I wouldn't bother; I'm way better off living by myself. Also, I'm not in the USA. It sucks how people on reddit just assume that everyone is."

298,"When I was 16, I was told I had ""pre cancer cells"" on my cervix, which were caused by an STD, and meant I'd need to have pap smears more frequently than other gals (to keep an eye on the progression of these cells and have them scraped off if necessary). Problem was, the only things that had ever been in my vagina at that point were tampons and my fingers. Needless to say, I couldn't convince my parents that I wasn't having sex when my gynecologist was saying I had an STD. I was fiercely grounded and lectured. It was about 20 years later when a test was developed to determine which of 2 versions of this pre cancer existed (one version is caused by an STD, one was not). I was tested and of course it came back that my cells were not caused by an STD. I'll never get those 2 years of being grounded back and I have to get my cervix clipped regularly, but my mom did apologize, so I've got that going for me, lol."

315,"It was a whole goddamn shit show.

In my Sophomore year of high school, I got really sick.  I had an injury where I could not use my arms very well and that got worse because I got pneumonia.  My mother and step dad were working all the time and I had to stay home from school for a while, so my aunt took care of me.  As far as I knew, she was just a bit of an odd lady but really she was just a relative who lived close to us.

No, she was a fucking nuts.  She filled my head with a bunch of sexist bullshit about how a woman should be and act and what our place in the world was.  It was at the worst possible time for me, too.  I had been going through my teenage crisis stuff right then and latched onto it.

I decided to become the girly girl I was supposed to be according to her.  I stop doing martial arts, I went heavy into gymnastics and cheer leading, I got my makeup game on point, wore dresses and skirts, stopped carrying knives and hunting.....Yeah, it was a whole new me.  A completely different me.

During this time, I started dating a somewhat childhood friend of mine.  About 6 months or so goes by and he proposes.  Because of how screwed up I was, I thought that was my goal in life to get married and have babies and stay a housewife.  I said yes.

He controlled everything that I did from that point on.  He would chastise me for eating bad food, was disapproving(to downright hostile) any time I wanted to hang out with my friends(which included guys), insisted that he drive me around anywhere, had me join the same classes with him the next year(even though it did not fit with my college plan), etc etc.  It fucking sucked, but I thought I was supposed to like a guy telling me what to do, so I pasted on a fake smile and stayed there.

Almost a year into this, I broke down to my mother in a massive fit about how much I hated myself and how I would hate being married and how upset at everything I was.  To keep this from being too long, she helped me to break things off with him.

After that, it got nasty.

I started to hear rumors about me.  I slept with him on the first date, I used to give him blowjobs in the parking lot, I wanted him to shit on me after sex, I was sleeping with the entire football team(for money), I cheated on him with someone(like the principal or the obese kid), he had dumped me because I had hit him, I had a mental breakdown and tried to kill myself, I slept with my brothers, I was a drug addict, and probably others I cannot recall right now.

Well, I was really an asshole before this and so those rumors spread really easily.  Plus, his mother was also spreading those rumors to the adults in the town, so it was even more likely to be believed when you heard adults talking about it.

It sucked.  I ended up leaving my hometown and joining the military just to get away.  I even now rarely go back to my hometown because of that shit."

She pushed through the pain and walked everyday. Eventually she was confident enough to join a group that jogged during lunch. I remember asking her about it, because I get shin-splints when jogging for a long time, ""Doesn't it hurt?"" Her response: ""It hurt walking everyday for at least 6 months. After 6 months, the pain was still there, but it didn't bother me anymore."" Yea, my Mom is a fucking terminator or something.

The jogging turned to walk/run session, and next thing you know she was signing up for a half-marathon. At 47 she completed the LA Marathon. She's now 53 and has a wall of medals from her Marathon runs. A typical non-training Saturday morning for her is now a 4 mile run, which is nothing to her. She's completely changed her diet, because eating poorly caused her extra pain while running. Running is a part of my mom's life now, a very important and enjoyable part. She is nowhere near obese, and when going through old photos, my wife who never knew her when she was larger, legitimately didn't recognize the old picture of her. My mom was really happy about that.

343,"My son was 7 when his dad and I separated, and introducing folks happened organically.  I had a number of friends, male and female who my son knew, and so when I was dating someone who wanted to spend time with me, he could just come over and the kiddo would meet a new friend.  I avoided any overt displays of affection in front of the kiddo, and limited sleepovers to when he wasn't with me.  Eventually, I started dating a long-time friend, and, since it developed organically, there wasn't a big 'break the news' conversation with my son.  

Having said that, I do see how it could be problematic to expose your kids to someone you're dating in early stages.  Before I started dating my now-husband, I was dating someone semi-seriously, and so he spend a fair bit of time with my son and I.  When we broke up, it was tough for everyone, and it made me very hesitant to introduce anyone to my son after that."

346,"I didn't go on a single date until after some of my friends were already married because I was busy chilling in the closet. Also for as long as I lived at home and a few years after I thought I was 2unattractive4life, so even without the closet I probably wouldn't have tried.

I dealt with it by having a lot of friends and sometimes being angry that I would never ever have that other stuff. But for the most part it was cool --- I never felt isolated or lonely because I had a wide social circle and way too many interests to be able to pursue them all. 

The worst was when I went somewhere with a couple and they'd kinda treat me like their kid (I'm slightly younger than many of my oldest friends). Like one time my friend and his girlfriend picked me up at home and then I don't know what we did and then they bought me ice cream. It was weird."
347,I bet she has things taped under there. The logistics just don't work otherwise. 
348,Poorly
349,Personality. I don't understand why 90% of men who approach me on the street ask me out before I've even said one word.
350,maybe she was tired of everyones shit and just needed an excuse?
351,"My cripplingly low self-esteem. Seriously it shames me how insecure I am about myself, and then my self-esteem dips even lower because of how badly I criticize myself over everything. "

355,"You don't *have* to. They're estheticians. Hair removal is part of their job.
You trimming just makes the job a little easier for both involved. It is in no way a prerequisite. "
356,"Not a horror story, just a pet peeve: please don't ask me tons of personal or business questions. I'd love to tell you every hair trick I know, I'd love to hear about you, gossip about others, or hell, even discuss the damn election. Doing hair in silence is also great. 

But for the love of God, I see about 200 people a month. I know it seems polite to ask if this is my busy season, am I doing well, when will I hire more staff, have I heard of (random other salon)? Why am I busier during the holidays than the summer? How many men vs women do I see? Where am I from? Oh what part of Arizona? Oh I've never heard of that town, where in Arizona is that? What brought me up here? Do my parents come up to visit often? Never!? Oh am I sad about that?

It's just.... a lot. Of having to explain myself. 

I love all my regular clients and I want to love you, too, in time, and I understand as your new stylist if you want to interview me a bit and make sure I'm not a numbskull. 

But if I keep trying to steer the conversation away from my life and back onto you or your hair, it'd be super awesome to switch the topic for a minute so you can chat at me and I can breathe for a sec. "
357,"Yes. She told every one at family dinner how she was practicing role playing turning us away, so she'd be strong enough when it happened. No joke."
358,"Mine would have been $36k. But that was a c-section with twins and a one night NICU stay for them. Thankfully I had amazing insurance at the time that made my entire pregnancy cost $350. $50 covered all the doc visits and the $300 was the hospital stay.

My insurance isn't nearly that great anymore."
359,"My SO was like this when we met, mostly out of ignorance and never having learned how to handle money. The key factor that made it not a dealbreaker is that he happily accepted my help to fix it, and now he's out of debt and totally on board with budgeting and saving. My dad makes terrible financial choices but refuses to cooperate with anyone who tries to help, and my very frugal mom is miserable because of it. Attitude is everything. "
360,"No, I actually support legalization because I think the criminalization - and especially the sentencing - is ridiculous and overblown. But oh my god, I hate that smell. 

My parents are both pot smokers, and I grew up around a lot of people who smoked through them. The smell is really offensive, and I can't say I'm impressed by the way stoned people act. I'm fine with my friends doing it or whatever, but I couldn't ever stand to live with it again, so a relationship is going nowhere if the person is a regular smoker."
361,"Passive aggressive behavior in general. If you can't talk to be about something that bothers you *like an adult in a healthy relationship should*, I want no part of it."
362,"This is a very sad thread and I can relate (36 m). When I was a kid I had an abusive father and my mother had to work all the time. The rough childhood made it difficult to connect with others. From as early as I can remember to 22 I felt utterly alone. It felt like my heart was starving. 

I'm happily married now with a beautiful daughter, but the memory of that pain still lingers and when I hear people talk about it I immediately empathize. 

I've worked with burn victims and amputees in the Army (I'm a former Army chaplain) and many of the burn victims suffer isolation and rejection like you wouldn't believe. The majority have their spouses leave them shortly after their injury. And, no matter how big and tough you are, when your face scares little children, it breaks your heart.

I say all of this to share a conclusion that I've come up with: I'm going to love.

I'm going to find broken, abandoned, and struggling people and love them, whether or not I'm loved back. In my experience, the more I step out and care for people, the more I'm loved back, but my purpose isn't to be loved anymore, it's to love. There's a big difference there and I think it defines you. 

There's millions of orphans out there. There's burn victims suffering the agony of rejection. And numerous others who need help and love. 

You can curl up into the fetal position and wither away or you can get out there and start healing somebody else's misery. Your life will be measured not by how loved you were, but by how much you loved. 

The burn victims I mentioned usually go one of two ways: midnight cowboy or rockstar. The midnight cowboys isolate from society and only shop at night, hence the name. The rockstars, grateful to still be alive, bounce back from their loses and start hitting on nurses and move on to do incredible things. I met several BVs that actually married their nurses. 

Most of you aren't burn victims, but even if you are: Make a list of what you can still be grateful for and be a rockstar!

He was making all kinds of creepy remarks that were getting more and more disgusting and she looked like she was about to cry. I walked up and put myself between them and pretended I knew her from a class. Just completely shut him out. I started blathering non-stop about some class that I'd actually taken that she actually hadn't been in and she just nodded along. He breathed behind me reallyhuffily  If for a bit, then sulked and got off the bus. If you're unsure about doing something, do it if you're not putting yourself in immediate anger.

377,"As a boyfriend to a girl who sometimes struggles with this issue, this is good advice. It helps you like you said, verbalizing the problem and getting some time alone to collect your thoughts, and it helps me because I know she's just in a bad mood and I didn't do anything wrong. It's also a good warning to me to just take a step back and don't try to ""help"", which typically just makes things worse. "

393,Learning how to remove blood stains means no longer having period panties and ruining cute pairs. 
394,"I think the key here is that regardless of how Clinton may personally feel about gay marriage (and I believe she supports it), you CAN trust that she will support the constitutionality of Obergefell v. Hodges and the right of gay marriage to remain legal in all 50 states. And that is what is critical about the issue. Tim Kaine is a devout Roman Catholic, and personally opposed to abortion, but he has consistently and publicly stated that he supports the constitutional right to privacy for a woman to make her own reproductive choices. So it doesn't matter to me how he personally feels about the issue, as long as he supports the constitutionality of Roe v. Wade. I respect that in any politician, and it has become a rare sight after the hard line, rigid, uncompromising Tea Party takeover of Congress."
395,"No or little physical attraction. I used to buy into the whole ""looks don't matter"" thing....they do. They totally do. It's way to painful trying to force myself to be attracted to someone, and painful for them because they know what's going on. Never again."
396,I remember it being weird in that it felt like it was super hard yet a little squishiness over the hardness. Like thick cut bacon over a lead pipe. Then all wrapped in soft super soft skin. I had never felt anything like that on a human body before. 
397,"He had clearly checked out of the relationship but was too complacent to actually do anything about it. I decided the pain of trying to be with and love someone who didn't want to be with or love me was worse than letting him go. So I ripped the band-aid off and did the breaking up for us.

It was *awful*. He seemed relieved, I was heartbroken. But the sadness and heartache from missing him and grieving the future I thought I had didn't hurt nearly as much as the every day torture of desperately hoping to win his love back during the last couple months of the relationship."
398,"I worked as a law clerk for an abusive, evil woman. Just the meanest person I've ever met. I would feel literally sick every single time my phone would buzz because I knew it would be another abusive text from her. I lasted about three months, crying myself to sleep basically every night. It took me a solid year to begin getting my confidence back.

I recently had lunch with the guy she hired after me. He lasted six weeks. He said he lost 15 pounds because he was too anxious to eat. "

407,"Not that this excuses what she did (nothing does), but chances are good that she was raised in some truly hairy circumstances. 

I was raised by a mostly absent father and a borderline personality disorder mother who is also a hoarder. I wasn't as inconsiderate is your chick, but it took two years of cognitive behavioral therapy after college that was specifically focused on hoarding and housing, in order to make it possible for me to live in a 'normal' housing situation. I truly and literally did NOT see the mess that I made at times, the same way that you don't really ""see"" your knick-knacks and photos hanging on the wall after a while. And until I had therapy, I have extreme anxiety about neat spaces; I didn't know how to live in them. I slept with stuff covering my bed for years, because a full-sized bed that just contained me was too empty for me to handle.

It sucks, and I'm glad that my roommates before therapy were also messy AF, so they weren't particularly bothered, as they were just as/nearly as bad as me. "
408,He was definitely masturbating.
409,"Senior year of college. I'd been living on my own off campus for the prior three years but I found myself needing campus housing for my final year at the last minute.

Got paired with a desperate still-a-freshman. Like, she had spent a year at school full time but only obtained 18 credits. Great for her, since with my seniority we both got to live in the *really really nice* upperclassman apartments.

She was a slob in the typical ways (cooking bacon uncovered on the stove, grease everywhere, fanned the smoke with a box of my favorite cereal which then popped open and flung Reese's Puffs all over the kitchen, did not clean it up), but I soon discovered she was an exhibitionist. 

""Hey, I have a class presentation tomorrow and couldn't decide on an outfit, can you look through the pictures I took and help me choose?"" She just sat there staring at me as I flipped through the photos on her camera and then just smiled when I suddenly had an eyeful of her vagina, spread-eagle on our living room carpet.

She broke up with her boyfriend and then had him secretly move in with us because he was ""homeless"" (his parents enforced a curfew and didn't want their 19 year old kid drinking in the house). They would deliberately have sex when I was home. I walked in on her giving him head only for her to turn and smile at me with a mouth full of dick more than a handful of times.

Final straw was when I woke up one morning (we shared a bedroom, as is typical in university housing) and looked down from my lofted bed to her naked ex sleeping on her bed, roomie nowhere to be found. She'd left me alone with an enormous naked dude who I didn't really know and definitely did not like or trust.

I finally told the Resident Director what was going on (sexually harassed, overnight opposite-sex 'visitor' against our policy, felt unsafe) and the verdict was since I was the one with the problem I was the one who had to change housing.

I ended up with some really cool women for the last part of my senior year, but I'm still grumpy about how that all turned out."

411,"There was a comment on a thread about embarrassing moments a few weeks ago, where this woman posted something about trying to fight a bully when she was a little girl, but she tripped and instead of getting back up and continuing to punch the girl, she got up and pranced away while whinnying like a horse. I was waiting to see my therapist at the time and I was still laughing so hard when I went into the appointment that I ended up having to show her the thread.

We wasted like a good quarter of that appointment just in hysterics about that."
412,"This may sound trivial but it was SO annoying. One house mate would spend over 30min on the toilet and in a house with one bathroom for seven of us it got really annoying. In the end I would start knocking and he'd come out within five minutes luckily. The bizarre thing would be he would walk out with his laptop, without flushing and there was no evidence of the toilet being used! I have no fucking idea what he was doing in there - many people suggested he was masturbating but if this is the case why couldn't he do it in his own room? I could never discuss the issue with him as he didn't speak English.

Anyway one night I woke up needing to pee at 4am and thought 'finally, the toilet will be free and I won't have to wait'. But NO! He was in the toilet again, GRRR. 

I still am puzzled by this behaviour to this day. "

418,"I have this issue with my SO. There's a lot at play - bed size, human size, animals - but the main factor is that I've had serious sleep issues since I was a young child. A normal night for me involves 30-60 minutes of lying in bed awake and moving around before I can fall asleep, and I have several nights a year where I wind up lying awake most or all of the night. 

SO and I maintain separate bedrooms. Sunday through Thursday, we each sleep in our own room, then Friday and Saturday we share, because we don't have to worry about being rested for work the next day. "

427,"A few months after the 3/11 earthquake and tsunami, my cousin posts a picture of her chugging milk on Facebook. 

My aunt (her mom) comments that she shouldnt be doing that. Why?

Because the radiation traveled through the air and ocean to the US water and soil, was ingested by cows, and now was in our milk supply. She was adamant about this, and POSITIVE it was enough radiation to pretty much drop dead kill you. 

I tried to explain to her that even if it had already reached the mouths of some poor Georgia cow her daughter was getting milk from, the radiation would be less than that of an x-Ray. No dice.

So then I appealed to her hysteria and said - are we not breathing the air and drinking the water the cows are? Why aren't you freaking out about the water, why only milk? What are you planning on eating that hasn't been polluted, twinkies? 

My cousin responded that I needed to grow up, her mom is ALWAYS right about these things so she's going to stop drinking milk.

I was just speechless.

At home she was eating mostly fruits and veggies and grains and drinking milk with breakfast and dinner basically. At our place she was having strawberry yogurt for breakfast, with a gatorade, and then mac and cheese for lunch, another gatorade, and cheese pizza at dinner, with gatorade.
