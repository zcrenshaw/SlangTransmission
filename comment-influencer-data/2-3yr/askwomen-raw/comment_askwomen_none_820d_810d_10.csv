At least the Amazon reviews are funny."
1,"Well I'm not planning on taking it to the grave but....


I went back to college 3 years ago @ 41 years old.


I haven't told my mother yet (she has nagged me for 20+ years about it).


I'm waiting until I graduate and then will present her with the invitation to graduation, all of my Dean's List certificates, the article that was written about me in the school magazine, and my National Honor Society certificate."
2,"We don't have to hide a boner when we get aroused. I can really enjoy a good hug without having to worry about poking someone. It's natural, but it can be uncomfortable for the other person..."
3,"Complimenting me by putting down other women. Especially if it's by putting down *all other women*. 

Dude I can guarantee that I am not the ONLY woman who [anything].  "
4,"I mostly hated university and spent 4 years just waiting for it to be over so I could actually start my life. I told my parents, who paid for it, that I loved it. My degree has been useful but I hated every second spent getting it. I am the first person in my family to go to university though and they were just *so proud* of me it'd break their hearts if they knew I spent almost all my time alone, didn't fit in and didn't make any friends in the time I was there. 

Also, my cousin's new baby is *really ugly.* 

I won't say anything because it's horrible, but it's true.  "
5,"My year 7 science teacher bet us all a packet of Polos each that we wouldn't get through the first two weeks of class without someone getting a Bunsen burner injury.  

I did in fact get burnt. Nasty blister on my thumb, but I kept it to myself. We got our Polos."
6,"I was at a mall and heard a woman scream from the upper level. I turned around, looked up....and reflexively caught a toddler who had somehow managed to squeeze between the iron safety rails and fallen literally on top of me, a good 20-25 feet below. Perfect catch, not a scratch. I've replayed this in my head dozens of time and still to this day do not know how the hell I did this.
"
7,"Just the whole idea that sex should be used/withheld as some sort of bargaining chip. Sex should not be a reward for men, nor should it be a task for women. Likewise, sex shouldn't be an act that is done *by* men *to* women. Sex should be a consensual act enjoyed between partners because they want to enjoy it."
8,"Well I'm significantly less likely as a woman to be red-green color blind, or have hemophilia."
9,"What we eat.

If I get a salad, I get comments about being on a diet or ""eating rabbit food."" If I get a burger, I get comments about how it's attractive that a woman actually eats. I just want to have my food without anyone's input."
10,"I have a clit, and it never gets caught in my zipper. Also no balls to protect. 

Edit: I understand not every guy has done this. It's just a ""common"" guy issue as far as jokes go. You can stop proudly declaring your exemption from it now, thanks."
11,"As a shorter person, I fit into plane seats better. "
12,"my 6 year old got up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. He was taking longer than usual so I went to check on him. Before going in I stopped in the hallway because I heard him talking. Listening closer I realized he was talking to one of our anxiety prone cats telling him ""its oki rosie its just me you dont have to be scared no more Ill stay with you til you stop being scared youre such a good boy rosie I love you you lovely kitty"" heart melted"
13,"When someone in a romantic movie travels across the country to surprise the one they really love but she doesn't know it yet...

I've seen that play out IRL; He drove 9 hours over night to surprise her at her parents house over spring break. They'd been dating 2 weeks at this point. She freaked out.

Another! Girl breaks up with guy after 3 months because she was going to study abroad in France and wanted to enjoy herself and tells him that it won't ""be on"" when she comes back either. He liquidates his bank account and buys plane tickets to Paris to surprise her. Literally shows up and she has someone else in her dorm room and then is shocked that she's freaked out and upset- and she won't let him stay. Since he liquidated his bank account, he couldn't change his flight back and had to live on the streets and in the airport for two weeks. He still didn't understand why she blocked him on social media."
14,"Husband: Why do you think you have three brothers and you are the only girl?

Daughter: Because I'm worth three boys.

The hair flip was strong."
15,I mean if your dick doesn't reach the zipper then you won't have that risk. 
16,"welp, i got linked on the main reddit and my inbox is being spammed by assholes. i might save a screencap for everybody. thanks for the support, people of AW!  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.2570  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/53739)"
17,"Just the other week at petsmart I saw dog treats in separate packages ""for boys"" (in blue) and ""for girls"" in pink. They were the exact same treats."
18,"The other party puts in the bare minimum of effort. You're always going over to *their* place, they never bother to come to yours. Or when you want to see them/talk to them, they don't text you back... they only want to interact with you when they don't have anything 'better' to do."
19,"Honestly, four packs of ramen but one is accidentally beef flavor."
20,"Jane Goodall. She was told for a lot of years that she couldn't be a scientist because she was a woman. Despite everything, she completed a 55-year study of Chimpanzees and their behavior. She is considered the world's foremost authority on Chimpanzees. She has been granted the title of Dame by the Queen. She started multiple foundations, including one for kids called Roots and Shoots where the focus is on general science, ecology, and conservation. She's amazing."
21,"""You can change him!""

Uh, no, you can't. He has to be willing and committed to changing himself; you can't do it for him. (Another thing: sometimes, what you're trying to fix isn't broken.) If you can't love him and accept him for who he is, just as he is, or if he's treating you like garbage, you need to get out and find someone who's actually compatible with you (and doesn't treat you like garbage). That goes for him, too. All of it."
22,"""Excuse me, 911? Yea, I just witnessed a murder"""
23,"Donuts, flamin hot cheetos, avocado, and coffee beans. I'm a mess "
24,"The ""ball and chain"" type metaphor with their wives.  I hear this a lot at work, it's weird to me that people trope their wives like that."
25,"Anything relating to any iteration of ""she wouldn't give me the time of day, but eventually I kept asking her out and wore her down and now we're in looooooove!"" 

How is it romantic that you didn't respect being told no, ignored her wishes in favor of your wants, and had to basically convince someone to be with you? Like, what?"
26,"Burns my britches a little bit when I see those pink tool kits.  They usually look like children's toys when they're right beside the ""gender neutral"" ones.  "
27,"This is very apocalyptic and a little economic: I need less food to survive. Buying enough food for the men in my life has been almost shocking. 


I'm smaller and can shimmy into places the men in my life can't fit, and my hands are more dexterous too, which is helpful. 


And the pain tolerance being higher is nothing to joke about either. "
28,[removed]
29,"Unsolicited advice. 

I've had first dates where the guys have told me

- that the way I'm raising my daughter is wrong
- that I shouldn't wear high heels since I'm tall
- that my dress was too short for my age

In all these instances the guys have been surprised that I declined a second date. Dude, work on that social intelligence."
30,Last night my 3 y/o daughter informed me we call fire ants 'spicy boys'. 
31,Multiple orgasms. The cruel trade-off is that it's generally more difficult for women to reach orgasm in the first place.
32,"""In this house, we do ____."" List of fourteen obvious things any decent person would do. 

Where did this thing even get started?"
33,"Love Actually

A guy secretly films his best friend's fianc√©e  and then after they're married he goes to their house unannounced, tells her to lie to her husband and say there are carolers outside, then he professes his undying love for her even though they've exchanged like a total of five words. 

That's creepy af and puts her in a weird situation. Plus it's a shitty thing to do to your supposed best friend."
34,"I think everyone deserves paid sick days. Menstruation related things can fall under that along with illness and family sicknesses.

Paid menstruation days just gives incentives against hiring women and for many women it is unnecessary. For those who do have debilitating menstrual cycles, it should fall under medical protections."
35,"Men's Q-tips. [Yes, that's right](http://www.qtips.com/product/detail/1182569/qtips-mens-pack), Q-tips. Advertised as a ""multi-tool"" and perfect for things like ""car detailing""!"
36,"""If a doctor perscribes you some medication, especially for a mental issue, you're definitely better off taking a good stern look at youself in the bathroom mirror and flushing the pills down the drain. A montage of you overcoming your troubles via pure willpower is sure to follow.""

I'm horrified by these scenes - and they are so common!"
37,"By nature of being a lady, even a big lady, people assume I'm harmless.  


But it works to my advantage. "
38,[deleted]
39,Putting women down for liking traditionally feminine hobbies such as makeup. Invalidating our feelings because supposedly women are over emotional and exaggerate things.
40,My son will opt out of playing with other kids to go pet a dog.  He will remain petting the dog for the entire visit.  
41,"I gave my sister some money for college. I'm pretty certain she knew it was me, but when she asked, I played dumb and never owned up to it. She was intent on doing tuition herself, but I overheard her tell a friend that she was going to have to take a small loan for the last year because her job was cutting her hours. I didn't want her to have debt, so I helped out. Anytime she asks, I change the subject and play dumb, so I'm fairly certain she knows"
42,"Daughter was asked what she wanted to be when she grows up and she said ""a warrior.""

Edit: another one: When my mom mentioned to my daughter that her pants didn't match her shirt, she turned to me and said, ""At least I'm *wearing clothes,* right mom?"" That's right, girlfriend."
43,"I promised my 4th grade best friend I would never ever tell anyone who she had a crush on at the time. I don't know why this sticks out to me, it's kind of silly, but I have never told anyone even though it's been almost 20 years and I haven't even seen her since 8th grade. "
44,"For me, it's casual shit-talk about marriage, how my husband must not get laid, why'd he let me cut my hair short, he's got a ""ball and chain, amirite??"" My husband has to be the most bachelor-iest, freest married dude I know. I rarely ask him to help me (and it's only with stuff I physically cannot do), he plays video games all the time, I don't dictate his schedule, ever.

I don't like that marriage is seen as the end of your social or sex life, and being committed to him makes me feel (and he'd say the same) that I have the best parts of being single because we don't do the ""ask permission"" thing, we really are like 2 people, oddly enough"
45,I remember there was a Dr. Pepper 10 that was geared towards men because apparently diet soda is too feminine
46,"I work in a male dominated industry and get a lot of comments from male coworkers about how surprised they are that I ""turned out to be"" so smart/competent/authoritative/professional etc. after they've gotten to know me. I let it slide because I know they mean well and they're not the most socially capable group of dudes but WOW talk about a backhanded compliment! 

I've also found that when I'm the only woman in a work group or area, I'm constantly asked how to fax things, reserve a conference room, to organize a potluck, etc. I'm not the Office Administrator and I'm definitely not your mommy. "
47,"When you have a complaint, their reaction is always annoyance instead of trying to understand and communicate with you. As if you need to be there as entertainment and anything negative coming from you is a burden on them."
48,"Telling women to smile. I get it from old men all the time, and I guarantee they never tell other men to put a smile on their face.

I'm allowed to have hard, stressful, or sad days. I'm sick of having to be ""happy"" and smile for them. It's a control thing."
49,[removed]
50,"All the nonsense about ""wait two days to text him back"" blah blah. No. If you like him, tell him so directly and use the word ""date"". I think romcoms are the source of it for the most part, but this book was responsible for a surge too: https://www.amazon.com/All-Rules-Time-tested-Secrets-Capturing/dp/0446618799

Even in Juliet's balcony speech, she apologizes for being so ""forward"" and saying how much she likes Romeo when she thought she was alone! And a man (?) (probably) wrote Romeo and Juliet. Women have been told it's not modest to be direct for a loooooonnngggg time in our entertainment (and god forbid you be immodest)."
51,"I hate this too. If you dislike your wife so much and consider marriage to be ""the end"" then...why did you get married? Unless you were forced by violence or blackmail, you don't *have* to get married. 

My fiance likes to counter those comments with ""I'm sorry you felt like you made the wrong choice but I actually like spending time with my fiancee."" "
52,"My son, 37 yo, walked into the house after work mumbling ""Wine. We have wine. I know there's wine here."" 

Rough day, kiddo?"
53,"Also,  a feigned look of pity and a gentle ""I would be so embarrassed if I spoke to people the way you do.""
Bonus points if there are others around to hear it, as they'll always agree with you."
54,"EAT signs in the kitchen. WINE signs above the wine rack. WASH signs in the bathroom. We get it, we know what room we are in and what we're supposed to do in there. It's so basic and pretentious. "
55,[deleted]
56,"As a black man I understand this 100%. The number of times I've gotten ""oh well you're different"" or ""you're X for a black guy"" is fucking infuriating."
57,I am definitely a lot more flexible than pretty much all my male friends. It makes yoga fun
58,My genitals are inside me and between my legs so generally pretty well protected.
59,Don't have to worry if my dick will get/ stay up
60,"When my seven year old was a bit younger, she gave me a big hug when I dropped her off to daycare, and said ""If there's ever a zombie apocalypse, I hope they eat you last"".

Thanks, kid. "
61,"Most things tbh, unless it's interacting with your sex-specific body parts. Like, why is my dish detergent so manly? It's fucking dish soap. Razors don't need to be gendered either! Also giving things boy names - like ""man bun"" or ""guyliner"" or ""man purse/murse""... *Those things already have names.* They don't need special boy names so men can have them.  "
62,"the Notebook. Ryan Gosling had to hang from a ferris wheel to get her to go out with him, which is basically the modern day equivalent of ""if you break up with me I'll kill myself"" "
63,"Any and all personal decisions, really.  

It feels like women get crap if they want kids, and they get crap if they don't. If they wear makeup, and if they don't. If they want to be a homemaker, and if they want to pursue a career. If they want to get married/have a wedding, and if they don't. There's always someone fucking judging, and there's no winning."
64,Crying. I don't do it for any other reason than an emotional release. It happens most when I'm incredibly angry. It automatically changes the conversation and most men assume I'm trying to be manipulative. Nope. I wish I didn't cry as easily as I do. This would be the number 1 change I'd make about myself. 
65,"When you're the lopsided partner:

* Your partner's future plans involve you, but your plans don't involve your partner.
* You want to keep your relationship and your social life separate. 
* You don't want to commit to plans that take place more than one week in the future.
* You don't want to introduce your family to your partner.
* You don't want your relationship to have an official title.
* When you make things official, it is due to a sense of obligation rather than excitement or happiness.
* You text them only to discuss when you will next meet up, not to make casual conversation.
* When you see an event you want to go to, your partner is second or third on the list of who you want to attend with.
* You typically dictate what movie/music/tv show is playing whenever you hang out.
* When there is an argument, you are not usually the first to apologize.
* When there is an argument that threatens the future of your relationship, you are unwilling to put forth effort into salvaging the relationship, and you are ambivalent as to whether the relationship continues or ends.
* You secretly think you can do better. 

I've definitely been the shitty partner before, so hopefully this list can help someone else avoid making the same mistakes I've made. "
66,"Sounds like a lottery to me. Women can:

-Orgasm in seconds

-Orgasm in minutes

-Orgasm in 20 minutes

-Orgasm NEVER

-------

-Able to orgasm continuously

-Able to orgasm several times within 5 minutes

-Able to orgasm a couple times in 30 minutes

-Able to orgasm once and then ""Please stop touching me!""

I think women roll both of these dice when they are made and get a wide variation of outcomes. "
67,"Bro talk is cool and all, but there's a difference between shooting the shit with friends and disrespecting women/your SO. "
68,Grease. She's not good enough for him until she changes everything about how she acts and how she looks. 
69,"I heard my brother (autistic) whisper to the dog ""I love you. But you're being an asshole."" In the only one who heard it other than the dog but I was full of pride."
70,"The going to their place one can have many reasons though. 

Your house is too dirty
You live with your parents 
You don't go grocery shopping enough
Your roommates are shitty people 
You have no parking
You live in a bad neighborhood
Your bathroom is a biohazard
You dont have a spare pillow
You don't have a coffee maker

All of these are reasons I've had for only wanting to hang out at my place. "

74,"One time, I flew into San Francisco, and my luggage came out *first* in baggage claim. I won the baggage claim lottery."
75,"When we went out to a steakhouse to eat. She wanted ribs and steak but I told her she could only have one or the other. So, she suggested my personal favorite compromise..

""How about you order the ribs and I'll order the steak and then I can eat your ribs too?""

So we shared!"
76,"My boyfriend's friends are starting to make these kinds of jokes and they really bug me.  Recently, one of them looked at me and said, ""Oh, come on.  Let him out for the weekend!  Don't kill his fun!"" About my SO going out drinking for the weekend.  

I was going out of state to visit family and he had already told me he didn't want to go out so he could save money and he just wasn't interested in drinking.  I responded by telling them he doesn't need my permission, I'm not stopping him from anything, and he can go out anytime he wants.  They continued to insist I ""let him out"" and ""let him have fun without me.""

It was super irritating.  Not only did it deny him his agency, but it's a stereotype about women in relationships that I honestly hate."
77,"I live in the south, and have been house hunting for several months.  If I see one more damn listing where everything is ""rustic"" and ""shabby chic"" and ""I love Jesus but I cuss a little"" I'm going to personally light it on fire."
78,"the whole pet food/product industry is marketed for people. dogs don't care what food they eat, toy they chew, bed they lay in.  the dog doesn't care that the food has naturally sourced exotic meat, it'll eat it's own poop if given the chance.  just my annoyance rant. "
79,"Cutting me off. I know plenty of guys who are otherwise awesome people, but will cut off girls mid-sentence. What's funny is they usually end up saying basically what you were already half-way through saying. "
80,Fuck you self-checkout machines. I already put the damn frozen pizza in the bagging area. It's not my fault you can't sense it. 
81,"My former boss loved her pink toolkit because it stopped her husband and sons from taking them- which I found hilarious.

All her tools that weren't pink would end up ""missing,"" and she would eventually find them among her family members stuff. The pink ones were never out of place. "
82,"Being too feminine or not being feminine enough. 

You literally cannot win it."
83,"I randomly get Snapchat selfy videos from my daughter with wacky overlay graphics. This causes me to roll my eyes and laugh out loud, which of course is why she does it. She's in her 30's."
84,"Fellow black guy here.

I always got ""You speak so well"" and ""You're one of the *good* ones."""
85,"&gt; packet of Polos

Like...the collared shirts? o_0"
86,"Gatekeeping.  

Like baseball? What's the batting average of the player in the clean up position for the Marlins? 

Like Star Trek? What was the name of Captain Christopher Pike's horse? 

Like heavy metal? Who plays drums for After the Burial, an obscure Minnesota heavy metal band? 

They think they're just trying to test us to make sure we're really fans, but they're trying to test us to see if we're just making it up to impress them into liking us. And that's almost NEVER the case. "
87,"""Can we do nothing and go nowhere today?"" - my 3yo son. That's my boy. "
88,Cool. So am I.

90,"Obligatory *Romeo and Juliet* mention.

Also, watching *Buffy* as an adult made me realize that the Buffy/Angel relationship was wrong on so many levels. Even if we can believe that Angel stopped mentally aging when he became a vampire, that would still make him 26-years-old. He started pining after Buffy when she was 15. They started dating when she was 16. Ew."

97,"Jane Eyre.
SPOILERS IF YOU HAVEN'T READ IT.
When you think about it, Mr. Rochester is extremely manipulative of this young girl who has no family to go to and no experience in the world outside of the female boarding school that she grew up in. He's powerful and rich and she is penniless. He makes her think that he's in love with Blanche Ingram and toys with her emotions there. Not to mention the whole secret wife thing. Looking back at it, Mr. Rochester is kind of the worst."
98,"A few years ago, I spent an hour at a coffee shop consulting with a potential client for a photography job. She wanted her fashion line photographed editorial style. It was a pretty intense gig and involved a lot of hours and commercial use licensing. Went over business plans, locations, potential models, etc.

At the end of the ""interview"" she says to me, ""So, I have this thing where I don't pay people the first time they work for me.. But this will be great exposure for you!""

Completely wasted my time and hers. For the sake of context, the words, ""I can't pay, but it will be good exposure for you,"" are some of the most disrespectful words you can say to someone in the art world."
99,"TV and movies are full of this shitty trope, but one of the biggest offenders (imo) is Scrubs. Almost all the women on that show use sex as a power play, or it's something they *tolerate* their partners doing to them (to say nothing about how the men are portrayed; desperate, pathetic, etc). I like the show but it's pretty damn gross sometimes."
100,"Taking things out of my hands to 'help.' I'm an adult, if I can't lift it I know that and will *ask* for your help. Also, if it is already in my arms it's pretty well proven that I can lift it.

106,"I grew up reading romance novels as a teen. 15 years later and when I reflect back on them I can't believe I liked them. I even re-read them several times. 
They were filled with coercion, stalking and heavy-handedness, on the male leads part. And sometimes rape too. And all of this non-sense was supposed to be romantic.

Disturbing."
107,"Spending a lot of time shopping for clothes when:

* Clothes sizing schemes make no sense
* Different levels of formality and different styles of clothes required for different occasions
* Clothing quality is poor in general
* Clothing is required to fit tightly usually so a good fit with the terrible sizing schemes are required
* The range between ""too revealing"" and ""too prudish"" is incredibly small"
108,"The overcontrolling guy, but who is ""romantic"" about it. He follows the woman around sneakily, asks who she is talking to, asks her who was on the phone call she took, and overreacts over minor incidents because he is just SO IN LOVE! People eat this up as passion. No, it's dangerous obsession."
109,"Mistreating or neglecting your kids. If you choose to bring people into the world, it's your responsibility and duty to give them the best life you possibly can."

112,"I honestly wouldn't care except to be pleased he felt comfortable sharing that with me. 

It seems like some people are concerned that a bisexual partner would have 'twice as many options'. But logically a) if they're not already inclined to cheat they probably won't start now because b) they've probably always been bi, the only difference is you didn't know about it before. So if you felt comfortable with their faithfulness before, them coming out as bi really shouldn't change anything. 

Being bisexual isn't the same as being a polygamist. So there's no reason your relationship should change. "

117,"As someone who lives in Japan, let me tell you that no one actually uses it because it's unpaid and no one wants to call in and tell their boss that they have their period. (Plus, missing work for *any* reason is highly looked down upon, so most people don't even use all of their paid leave.)

I'd say just add it as a valid reason for taking a sick day, and leave it at that. (Which probably already works in places that don't require a doctor's note, anyway.)"

125,"Here's mine: I *really* don't like my engagement/wedding ring all that much.   
Don't get me wrong, it's beautiful, just not my style.   
My now husband had it custom made with diamonds he got form his aunt's old rings, so its' got a huge center marquise &amp; a bunch of small diamonds.    
Marquise is really the only cut of diamond I dislike (which he knew) but he got it for free and wouldn't have been able to afford another cut.    
He basically got a 6K+ ring for only 1K (which is good cause we were broke).     

I just wish he would have consulted me a little on the design, I hate surprises &amp; I know it, so just knowing him &amp; his aunt were custom designing it without me just killed me.     

It's just so big &amp; shiny &amp; marquise-y. I know I sound like a brat and I really am grateful, I just would've picked something else.

Those stick-like women that are on pictures and wine glasses and stuff now.  I brought it up in another thread a while back and someone said they were supposed to be stylized like those fashion sketches that clothing designers use, but I still don't get why anyone would want to deck out their home with little pictures of women.

Flamingos.  It was quirky and funny at first, but there are too many of them now.

Almost to the exact day *this* April, while I was in Paris, and literally the same day I noticed my tan line from wearing it had finally faded away completely, I got a fb message from a complete rando letting me know they'd found a class ring at the bottom of the lake with my name on it and they'd like to return it to me. It looks pretty weird now after having been at the bottom of a lake for a year, but whatever! It's basically hidden treasure now.  

Coincidentally, I had been on a walking tour earlier that week where the guide had encouraged us to rub the boobs of this statue because it was supposed to bring good luck to the fondler. I'm thinking I'll have to go back for a second fondling sometime haha

ETA 2: [This is how the ring looked when I got it back.](https://imgur.com/gallery/FrA4K) It used to be the same color as the ring on the right! My pictures of the inside of it show its wear a lot better, but my full name is inscribed on it :/"

132,"When my oldest son was born, I couldn't believe how freakin' cute he was. No other newborn I had ever seen was as cute as him. I actually felt sorry for other parents, because all the other newborns in the hospital just looked misshappen and weird to me. He's 4 and ridiculously adorable now, so much so that we get stopped in stores by people exclaiming over him and his equally adorable 3 year old brother. But I look back at pictures now, and yep, he looked like any other newborn. His head was almost comically conical, his little face was beat-up and puffy, and his skin was blotchy and unevenly colored because he was bruised all over (he was a huge baby and I was in labor for several hours - my joke is that the stunned look on his face after he was born was ""dude, you really need to fix that door! I like to NEVER got outta there!""), but at the time, I couldn't see otherwise and I wouldn't have believed that he wasn't the most perfect baby ever born. The biological programming to love and protect our babies is really strong, and it's helped by things like this. Our own perceptions are altered so that we see our own babies as superior in every way to others, so that we will stay around and take care of them. Even when they won't let us sleep or eat, even at the detriment of our own health. 

But yeah, newborns (especially newborns that aren't yours) are kinda strange looking.

134,"Travel while you're young. I mean yes, I get the appeal and I see the value of it for sure. I'm not saying people shouldn't travel when they're young if they're able to. But it bugs me because it

 a.) doesn't talk much about the financial aspect of travelling. I know there are ways to save money while travelling that can help minimize the cost but still, travelling costs money and not every young woman will be in a position to afford it. I don't think it's a good idea to sacrifice financial security or put yourself in debt just so you can travel because everyone says you should do it in your 20's or you're missing out. 

b.) It kind of has this weird, underlying message that after your 20's you won't be able to travel. I'm assuming because these articles/magazines/blogs are assuming by 30 every woman everywhere will have a career and kids and obviously you can't travel then! And what about retirement? I know so many people in their 60's-80's who are travelling and loving it. It's not like once we reach senior-hood we stop enjoying life. 

It's not terrible advice but it's just annoying because it assumes that all women are going to lead the same kind of life i.e. single student/traveller to career woman and mom and obviously that's not the case for many women and no one should feel like they're missing out because they didn't get a chance to travel as a young adult."

I always felt uncomfortable holding his hand and eventually realized I just really didn't like him.

Me: I've been in [club] for two years and have held various leadership positions. *(I point to the section of my resume titled ""extracurriculars and leadership positions"")*
Her: Ohhh ok and you're able to start asap?
Me: I'm sorry, did I misread the job listing? I thought it said the position would start for the spring semester... in two months. 
Her: No it doesn't *(checks listing)* ohhhh sorry I thought I was recruiting for *this* semester. You're right. 

It went on that way for a little bit longer. She clearly hadn't read my resume and didn't have a clue about anything. To my surprise, she then offered me the internship on the spot. 

The next day, I received an email from her saying ""Sorry, I actually decided to go with another candidate instead. I've forwarded your resume to one of the stores for a sales associate position""

I obviously wasn't planning to accept the internship after that terrible interview but I couldn't believe she would offer it and then change her mind within 24 hours! I never responded to her email.

On the day that the seniors had to take some kind of standardized test in the morning, the juniors were instructed to go and sit in the cafeteria and wait until they were done.

It would have been nice for her to sleep in and then just go to school when class started, but the administration nixed that idea.

210,"Not entirely about gender, but more class/ SES/ income. If a wealthy person indulges or gets a pedicure or has a girls' night, it's ""self care"" and taking time to enjoy life. If a non-wealthy person has ANY luxuries at all, there is this idea that they are ruining their own life or don't deserve anything nice in life. Being poor is probably among the most harrowing, depressing parts of the human condition, and yes, candy is bad for you, but sometimes those little indulgences are the only thing that makes life seem doable, yet poor people seem to get shat on for every. little. thing. that they buy or do or have, and given the advice to ""cook at home and eat veggies and lentils!"" 

Same with having 3+ kids - a wealthy family does it and they're a ""beautiful, #blessed family."" But a poor family does it and ""they need to learn about birth control."" Motherhood in particular has some really sexist, classist attitudes and double standards behind it.

Also, the idea of being ""open minded."" A lot of women I know, especially depending on the social circle, think that women who are traditional or religious or whatever are suffering from 'internalized misogyny' and the only way to be enlightened is *their* way, without acknowledging that no one's choices, even progressive ones, exist in a vacuum"

213,"The other person puts in barely, if any, effort in the relationship. You do the initiating, planning, paying, traveling, and emotional labor. They shrug off your concerns, especially regarding the relationship, and make more excuses to keep their behavior going than make even attempts to reconcile or listen to what you have to say. They don't want to partake in your interests, but expect you to partake in theirs. You are rarely, if ever, a priority--even when you are together, they would rather be doing something else than spend time with you. If they do make plans or promise to change behavior that is hurting you/the relationship, they typically don't follow through on their word."

220,"I'm finding that getting over an ""almost"" relationship can be harder than getting over a relationship that lasted a fair amount of time and came to a natural end. And that's why- there was no natural end. My almost relationship was so close to being a real relationship- he asked me to be his girlfriend and all that. Then two weeks later he went quiet and sort of started that pre-ghosting thing, ON CHRISTMAS. That felt like shit. You know what still feels like shit? The fact that I feel like I met this person who I felt so excited about, which is a feeling so hard to find these days for me. And we felt incredibly compatible. And he was affectionate in the ways that I need it most and it wasn't that I thought we were going to grow old together, no, but I thought we were going to really *have a relationship* and be together and know each other and share our lives together for at least long enough to get sick of each other. And it all went away. For a stupid reason. 

This was 6 months ago. I've been busy and haven't thought about it a lot until now for some reason. It's really bothering me. It's eating me alive honestly. The ever-present reminders that he still exists on social media don't help, but without them I think I would still be having these dreams. I try not to let it but I think it just makes me feel...inadequate. I'm usually so good at making these thoughts go away and I don't know what's gotten into me lately. I'll tell myself it's because I don't have anything *else* to worry about right now. My skin's good, money's good, house is good.. I must be looking for something else to covet.

251,"""Love can heal all."" 

No, no it can't. If your partner is mentally ill and you think you can just solve it or go through it together by just *loving them hard enough*, you need to reevaluate if they need you, or if you need them. Sometimes people need to be by themselves to heal and reflect, and that can mean the end of a relationship. *Don't* try to cling on because you think you can totally fix their problems by loving them. 

Supporting an SO is another story entirely, obvs. Some people think their love can actually change someone just by being present. It doesn't. And it can actually be harmful since someone could use it as a coping mechanism or escape (focus everything on the relationship and nothing on themselves) and never get better.

298,"In addition to what other people said, don't overly romanticize the person or what could have been. 

Story time: my grandma had an ""almost"" relationship with this guy named Bob. I guess they were kind of dating/not dating in high school but something happened to break them up. Then she got pregnant and had to marry someone else (my grandfather, to whom she was married until their deaths). 

But she always resented the fact that she had to marry him, because she felt like she would have been happier with Bob. So because she believed she could be happier, it became a self-fulfilling prophecy in which she wasn't as happy as she could have or should have been with my grandfather, who was a patient, loving, good looking man with whom she had three kids. 

I don't think they ever spoke or had an affair, she was just hung up on him. Meanwhile he married someone else and had a family too. Eventually Bob died and my grandma went and laid flowers on his grave and took a Polaroid of it, which is how I know all this. After he died she was really torn up because she never got to tell him how much she loved him all those years.

So maybe in a movie this would be sweet. And maybe it is, in a tragic sort of way. But she had a wonderful husband who she didn't appreciate as much as she should. She had three kids that maybe she wasn't as attached to as she could have been. She loved her family but she was kind of harsh and I wonder how much of that was resentment that she didn't get the life she thought she wanted when she was 22.

Sometimes I'm in danger of doing this myself; I had a hell of an ""almost"" too. My mom wanted to throw away that Polaroid because she didn't want to indulge my grandma, even beyond the grave. But I kept it, because I think it's a valuable life lesson.

* doesn't even take you out on dates hardly at all. you seem to skip straight past the exciting butterfly stage and straight to the hanging out at each others' houses watching netflix, stage. he never seems head over heels over you. and if you really think about it, neither did you until you had sex and got invested in winning him over.

* you initiate most contact and make most of the plans. he initiates most of the contact and makes the most plans... if they involve a sex-date. he drags his feet, is busy, or only very reluctantly agrees if you insist on doing something fun together. bonus points if he rushes through or half-asses the activity so he can take you home and get to the ''real'' fun part."

As the years rolled by, we began to feel there was a void in our lives we couldn't quite put our finger on as to what it was. We were financially in a good place. We had a good home. We had a lot of love to share, and nobody to share it with. By then, we were older, and past the point where we wanted to deal with the hassle of babies and toddlers. 

So, we decided to adopt an older child out of the foster system. There is a great need for homes for older kids, and whereas the costs of adopting a baby is staggeringly high, (most of a year's pay,) adopting out of the foster system is essentially free. We took in a 13 year old girl, who we fell in love with the moment we met her. She was a child filled with rage and bad habits from a lifetime of poor and neglectful parenting, but underneath was this intelligent, beautiful young woman that just needed someone to love her, discipline her, hold her. We went through over a year and a half of slammed doors, epic arguments, and occasional school discipline problems, and we consistently loved and disciplined her through it, never once turning our back on her. 

One day, she surprises me in the car and tells me she never wants to go back to her bio mom. She says she chooses us. She wants us. She's sorry for being a brat. And I, a grown-ass man, wept like a little girl.

She's ours, now, legal and true, and she's 16 now. She's in honors classes. She's got her first job. She's *pleasant* to be around.

So when people ask if I regret not having any bio kids of my own, I just point to my daughter and say, I may not have made her, but I love her the same as if I did. 

It might be that for you the ability not to have natural children is instead an opportunity to be there for another child. Keep your heart open."
311,"This might sound bad, but I mean it positively: we weren't as desperate to see each other. Prior to moving in, all of our time together seemed fleeting. Like we would need to jam as much into it as possible. When we starting living together (after about a year of dating), our relationship became calmer and more mature. It wasn't about making sure we had sex and did activities. It was about enjoying each other's company."
312,"SPLASH. With Daryl Hannah and Tom Hanks. 

I LOVED this movie as a kid because she was a mermaid. That's really all I cared about. Well I watched it with my best friend a few months ago and we were like ""wtf are you doing Tom Hanks..."" So this girl who can't talk, doesn't know anything about anything and attaches herself to Hanks is apparently very romantic because she has a high sex drive and Hanks is fine with it. She LOVES him after all... 

Like seriously. He knows nothing about her when they meet but it's fine because he thinks she hot and ""quirky."" What. So much in that movie was a big WTF. "
313,"I work in a bar and it's disgusting how people always compare me and the other bartender to try and get laid. They seem to think the other bartender can't hear them. All of these lines have been equally used on both of us:

""You're way hotter than her."" 

""I don't like her hair, I wish it was more like yours.""

""You have the better boobs/ass/legs.""

""Between you and me, I'm not into girls like that. I much prefer girls like you.""

""Her personality sucks, I like you better.""

Like ok? That's my best friend and no one asked for your shitty opinion.

316,"Razors. My mother always told me to use men's razors on my legs as they're cheaper, and the only way they could really be different to women's razors is by being made for coarser hair, which would mean that they give a sharper &amp; more efficient shave. Maybe.

I have a son who really likes things that are more girl gendered at toy stores. Like veterinary play kits, most stuffed animals, any sort of cooking stuff. He is 6, and has definitely absorbed the idea that he shouldn't play with ""girly"" stuff. For birthdays he never asks for or receives things that he really wants, gets some random superhero thing that sits in a closet forever gathering dust, and plays with the four or five beanie babies he has at home. If you aren't into superheroes, cars or toys marketed from disney/nick jr. shows, as a boy your options are limited. 

My daughter is a tiny total pink explosion of femininity and so doesn't seem to troubled by the extreme gendering of toys, but my son misses out. :-("

339,"So agree. So many times, the feeling of wanting to change your partner is simple incompatibility. 

Not even in abusive ways, but smaller ones. Ex: I'm pretty tidy, for instance, and being with a sloppy person would drive me bonkers and make them feel like I'm constantly nagging.

340,"I read the first two Shades of Grey books in college and absolutely loved them. I've owned the last book forever but hadn't gotten around to reading it yet until now and jesus it is way more creepy than I remember it being.

Who cares if he has serious control and mental issues. Now I am just creeped out by everything. Girl Run!

341,"I did the Ancestry DNA test and the DNA part was interesting enough, mostly what I expected. What I didn't expect was that they show you other people who could be 1-4 cousins of yours that have taken the test. I didn't pay it much mind until I got a message from another user. It showed we were likely 2nd cousins but I didn't know who they were. I have a big family but I knew who everyone was, except for my mom's biological father because he deserted my grandmother when she was pregnant. It turns out, the guy the messaged me is my mom's bio cousin who we didn't know existed. From there we learned more about my mom's paternal family. It has been quite surreal. "

I had a very simple lifestyle and had enough money for that with occasionally borrowing some money from friends. The reason I lied is my extended family always had negative comments about me working freelance and if they heard I wasn't making money that would only help them blame every financial problem me &amp; my mom had on me, which they already did even when I was making money. I had to lie to my mom too because she accidentally says stuff sometimes. I'm never going to confess because for no reason they treat me like a liar (never lied to them before this btw) and if they heard I lied, oh boy, I would never ever ever hear the end of it."

You look at their PowerPoints, their drawings, listen to their ideas.

349,"My coworker gets migraines frequently. Maybe we should implement migraine sick days.

This is ridiculous, that's what sick days are for. Periods don't affect women all the same way, and people deal with other issues that require they stay home. There's no need to have special days for periods. I also don't really need my employer and coworkers knowing when I'm on my period and tracking my 'period days off' "
350,"They look at vaginas all day.  **All day.** It seems obvious, but it's still easy to be self conscious, concerned, embarrassed.  When you catch yourself feeling that way, remember they have literally seen it all.  

And don't worry about any procedures they do in an annual visit.  Worst case scenario you're a little uncomfortable, but the discomfort literally lasts minutes (like less than 10, maybe even less than 5).  Not to mention, they're going to do their best to make you comfortable (or as comfortable as you can be with your legs in stirrups).  

Also, be sure to mention this is your first visit -- a good doctor will take that into consideration and explain what they're doing, looking for, etc. every step of the way.

Last but not least, remember to breathe.  Anytime you feel some discomfort take a nice big deep breath.  It's temporary.  Breathe and think of what you're going to treat yourself to after the visit.  I'd go with some ice cream with hot fudge, but be sure to think long and hard about what you're going to do *after* the appointment -- what self care you're going to indulge in.  I think this is the most important part, but that's just me.

Good luck!"

355,"It wasn't solely due to porn, but it was bleeding over into our lives in a horrible way. He had always been massively into porn, especially anal (especially violent stuff). I am a little squeamish about that but he made out like I was being a prude. Anyway I got pregnant and he started getting really angry when there were times I didn't feel like having sex. Towards the end it was hard to get into most positions, except doggy style pretty much. At one point he slipped into my ass and violently pounded me, which hurt like hell. I of course raged at him. I considered a separation but I was about to pop with this baby and couldn't deal with it right then. 

After I had the baby, he got super pissed off that I didn't want to have sex. He said my vag looked darker and looser and was showing me links for vag rejuvenation. The abasolute worst part was getting extremely pushy for blowjobs and anal because he ""had needs"" and my watching me give birth had ""ruined vaginas for him"". I guess jerking off to porn 3 times a day wasn't enough for him. I walked in on him jerking off to an anal gang bang, with *my daughter* (the baby) in the room. That was the final straw and I moved back in with my mom and started divorce proceedings."

After an hour of this he comes over and starts talking to me asking why I was looking at him, I tell him why and now we've been together for almost four years.

She missed the older kid's promotion from elementary school to middle school. I didn't. I took photos and a video of him walking on the stage and everything. 

I knew she'd want me to send it to her. I sent it publicly, just posted it on her timeline. I captioned it with something like, ""Hey, I know you probably want to watch this since you weren't there... so here's the video I got.

Just insinuating yourself in something that I'm doing/working on because you assume I need help.
