0,When I first started dating my husband I was surprised at how often he'd reference something I'd told him days or weeks earlier. The motherfucker was actually *listening* when I spoke. It blew my mind. 
1,"When we were first dating, I came into the room one day and discovered my now-husband cradling my cat and cooing to him over what a big, handsome boy he is. He (boyfriend/husband) was embarrassed but shook it off. Now that I think about it the cat was probably a little embarrassed as well."
2,"I went on a date with a guy once. It was to a nice Italian place. I had pasta. As I was swirling my pasta onto my fork, using the spoon to help, I accidntally flung some sauce onto my date. I laughed, he looked like I insulted his mother and excused himself to the bathroom. 


A few months later I went on a date with another guy, and because I don't learn from my mistakes ordered some super saucy pasta again. Same thing, but this guy laughed it off. Wiped up with his napkin and tried to fling some sauce at me. 

It made me really realize how important a sense of humor is, and with as klutzy as I am, I need someone who can laugh and roll with my mistakes. "
3,I always notice when the other person is just as polite to complete strangers as they are to me. 
4,"One of many, but NOT playing the texting game. When my current boyfriend and I were still just ""talking"" and right up to our first dates, I couldn't believe he'd actually respond immediately and carry on actual conversations.

I'd never been involved with someone new I felt like I could just contact whenever for no reason without it being too forward."
5,"My SO recently bought me a book that I couldn't even remember I wanted. He saw me check the price at the bookstore and put it back, then went back in a few days later and bought it for me."
6,"Just a lover? No. If he's not sticking around for anything serious then it doesn't matter. 

But he does have to give, taking is too easy and that's the way it is. "
7,The things men will do for pussy.
8,"When I started dating my now-husband, we went to the ocean in April (cold, rainy, not a sunny beachy-time like you'd picture). It was... a shitshow. We had his dog in the back, that puked, couldn't find parking, dog peed in the hotel room, the brewery we stopped at didn't have food that day (for some reason, and we hadn't eaten much), no GPS... it looked the a setup for a horror movie.

And... no yelling, no name-calling, no accusations. It was a fun adventure, rather than a terrible letdown. We stuck our toes in the ocean, but forgot dry socks. So we were cold, wet, hungry, lost and... to date, his patience and humor dealing with all of it is still one of my favorite memories"
9,"When I was first dating my husband I decided he might be a keeper after the first time I went to his house. 

First, he introduced me to his cat. She was a kitten he'd found abandoned by a dumpster behind where he worked. He took her home and bottle fed her until she was old enough to wean. She had twice as many toes as a normal cat and, as she got older, had issues with the claws from the freaky toes growing back into her skin. He'd paid the vet bills to have her extra claws removed. Dude was a broke college student working a crappy retail job but he scrounged up the money to take care of his spoiled rotten dumpster-kitty. 

Then he introduced me to his two ferrets. This quiet, reserved guy dropped to the floor, rolled around making goofy noises, and generally acted like a complete loon entertaining and playing with his ferrets. 

Anyone that saves dumpster kittens and turns into a complete idiot playing with his ferrets is my kind of guy."
10,When they approach with the sun at their back.  Shows they have tactical smarts.
11,"I lived alone and things were falling apart. He started staying over every night, because he lived an hour away. That kept up until I told him that he should just move in.

Having just been burned by an abusive moocher, I was on high alert and kicking myself for letting things progress so quickly.

First thing he did was dismantle and overhaul the lawnmower so that he could properly mow the grass. He then bought a second car and let me drive his awesome VW GTI. Then, he built me a PC. He methodically went about fixing or upgrading everything in my life. 

Over 15 years later, and he's still at it!"
12,"I had a sadly short marriage because my wife passed away young (married for just five years), but we had three pregnancies during that time. First one we weren't trying to, but were careless. Second one we weren't trying to, and we were even being careful. After that we just said ""Fuck it, after we hit four kids I'll get a vasectomy."" We loved everything about having kids so we just went caveman: do it when and how we feel like, and whatever happens, happens. So pregnancy number three wasn't unexpected, but neither was it really planned. She just told me one day that she was pregnant, again, and I said, ""cool!"" It was like we had a fun event planned in the not-so-distant future and we had some errands to run to get ready. Sex was really the same from the beginning of our relationship until the end: when we had time and energy, we fooled around and had fun. Babies were just a nice side-effect. (She was six months into pregnancy number three when I lost her in a car accident, so I never got to meet my third kid. Number one and two are teenagers, now, and are the best things in my life.)"
13,"Well yes, because friendship never ends.

 *girl"
14,"He's got a smoking hot registered nurse as a GF, she seems mentally healthy and fits him and his lifestyle. I've still got PTSD and moving again soon... He upgraded for sure. I'm happy for him because he deserves someone like him, without the kind of baggage I have... I'm also kinda sad because I'm still me. And he's got the cat... I really fucking miss that cat."
15,"I had left him for the many reasons our 7 yr relationship just wasn't working and we were both unhappy. Three days later, he brought me to a suite where flower petals were laid among all these happy pictures of us. And he proposed with a beautiful ring, but of a design that looked nothing like the style he'd always talked about getting for me. It was really hard to say no, but life isn't like the movies. One grand gesture doesn't change you or how you're living or cancel our debts to each other.

Months later, after getting his life straight and becoming comfortable with himself and his independent solo life (and me working on the same) we eventually got back together. We got married the next year, and we've never been happier 6 yrs into married life with an awesome daughter to boot."
16,"I was on a first date with a guy, and I noticed he was treating the waitstaff strangely. He would ignore them when they walked up until I addressed him. He wouldn't look over at them or acknowledge they spoke unless I did first. I thought it was weird, some sort of power play maybe? But he was polite and friendly to them once I directed his attention to them, so I decided to file it away as a yellow flag. On the second date, he reveals to me that he is completely deaf in one ear, and has to sit with his good ear facing the wall or else he can't hear the person he is talking to. He wasn't ignoring the waiters, he was just completely unaware they were there!"
17,"When I first started messaging with my long-distance boyfriend and there was talk about if we could video chat, I wanted to schedule it in advance so I'd have makeup on. And he went, ""I'm sure you're beautiful without it, but if using it makes you happy, then that's what matters most"". Not, ""Come on, you don't need it, let's just skype"" or, ""I don't like makeup, women look prettier without it"". I was sold, and reeled that weird little dude in like the rare fish he is."
18,Why the fuck didn't Ariel use writing as a form of communication with Eric.
19,Positive talking points. They talk about things they *like* instead of opening conversations by talking about things they don't like. Positive vs negative conversation is a big thing. 
20,"""the measure of a person is always in how they treat those who can do nothing for them""."
21,"Any time a woman is inexplicably wearing makeup.

You get a female character who's spent months as a prisoner in a dungeon or being marched across the desert, and apparently her captors have given her daily rations of bread, water, and mascara."
22,"I slapped my friend's Dad on the arse, in front of an entire party of 17 year olds.  
He was wearing the exact same outfit as my bff's boyfriend.   
The slap basically echoed through the party, it was awful. "
23,I'm basically 99% sure that my husband married me for my cat. 
24,"If you feel like you don't have to put on a front to impress the other person and most communication feels safe and straight forward both ways, that's a very green light in my experience.

I say ""most"" communication because there's obviously stuff you probably wouldn't talk about yet on date 3. But if most topics feel safe already and you feel like the other person understands and accepts you for how you communicate and what you talk about, and visa versa, that's what I'm referring to."
25,"&gt;All I could think is ""What the hell was he doing with me?!""

Maybe you blinded him with science?"
26,My husband does this to a point that would freak people out. He used to work overnights at a gas station and would remember conversations he had with customers weeks earlier and then bring it up when he saw them again. Most people wouldn't even recognize him and freak out that he knew about whatever was going on in their life or ask about how their vacation was.
27,"My highschool boyfriend who just completely broke my heart and I thought I'd cry myself to death for months and months afterwards....

Is totally a lazy balding flabby dweeb now. 

We got back in contact years after the breakup, decided to hangout and drink, got drunk and he was kind of whiney but I didn't think anything of it. I pass out over there and we wake up cuddling and like. 

His thin slimey peenie was poking me in the butt. And I just had this moment of really taking in my surroundings and this situation. This guy, My Ultimate Heartbreak, the guy who found my online journal then read my mortifying entries about him to his friends to laugh at after we broke up, the guy who would repeatedly stand me up or just in general be SUCH an asshole to me while I was so heartbroken... 

Was like 27 and had anime figurines on his IKEA desk in his dorm-room-sparce apartment. There were old beers everywhere and clothes on the floor. His body was flabby. His tattoos were stupid.

I got up, threw up in his bathroom, cleaned a glass in his disgusting kitchen so I could drink some water... and left. 

I don't know if I really ""dodged a bullet.""
But if I had still felt any pain over that relationship, I definitely don't feel it now. That wound got cauterized and the scar removed, I tell ya."
28,"Being called ""older"" for being over 25..."
29,I'm not sure if this counts but he asked me during sex while he was drunk. I told him he couldn't do that and what was he thinking? He realized his error the next day and it was just an ongoing joke between the two of us. Eventually he proposed for real. We're married now... he still says inappropriate things at inappropriate times but I love him and he'll do.
30,This is huge. My now-husband texted me the morning after our first date with a reference to something we'd talked about the night before. It just picked up where we left off and felt *right*.
31,"I didn't run into him but I saw his Facebook profile. He's doing exceptionally well. Studied, great career, thousands of friends, a really lovely wife and 2 wonderful children.

I, on the other hand...have a wonderful child. That's about it. I'm not awesome looking, I don't have a career, I don't have friends, I don't even have a penny to my name. That said, seeing him do so well was part of the reason why I went back to school some years ago. I'm really good at it, too."
32,Fairly certain this is the only reason my wife married me. She is out of my league in every way possible. But goddammit I listen.
33,"I was a new boss and had to fire an employee for the first time. She packed her bag, cleaned out her desk and I followed her to the door. And I said ... ""See you later"". It was just a habit. The way she looked at me ... I still cringe so hard thinking about it."
34,Oh gosh. Keep that one. That gives me the warm fuzzies in a huge way. 
35,"I tend to get impatient and finish people's sentences if I think they're going in a predictable way. It's craaaazy rude and I always get a little annoyed when people to it to me, so I make a concentrated effort not to. "
36,I'M GOING TO QUIT MY JOB AND BECOME THE ULTIMATE POKEMON MASTER. FUCK WITH ME.
37,I put the Q-Tip in my ear. fuck what the box says
38,Eh. Not as impressive anymore. I heard the pound became less last week.
39,"When I was a barista, I loved working the machine while Jackee worked the counter. She remembered pet's names, major events in peoples' lives, kids' favorite drinks, everything. I'm good at making lattes but suck at remembering things, so between the two of us we would make BANK"
40,"Secondhand Lions- a story about a boy who is sent to live with his two uncles for the summers. It sounds super boring, but is actually a really great movie with lots of adventure. It balances the funny and the dramatic perfectly."
41,And Harry and Ginny. Really really don't get it.
42,Accountability. Someone who owns up to their actions and offers a sincere apology when they mess up.
43,"I've noticed that people are increasingly unwilling or unable to withstand any form of discomfort whatsoever. Waiting, boredom, physical exertion, mental effort, etc."
44,Patriotism and nationalism are more or less the same thing. It's just that Americans describe themselves as patriotic and everyone else as nationalistic. 
45,"What do you mean? So tell me what you want, what you really really want... I'll tell you what I want, what I really really want."
46,"When guys ask questions that imply they think women are a completely different species, I generally assume they are quite young. Or when they ask questions like ""What do you think about a guy who wears a hat?"" or some other equally unimportant qualifier.

Also, when people give answers that are very black and white and they fail to see or they dismiss the grey areas of a subject, I wonder if they're young. Not always though. 

"
47,"We don't have kids. But my MIL has gone from advising us to not having kids to badgering us about it because she has decided she wants a grandkid and that, and that alone, should be reason enough. (All her friends have grandkids now!!)

I find it hard to put into words how disrespectful, and dehumanizing I find the idea that I should subject myself, mentally, emotionally, and physically to having a kid. Not to mention a lifetime commitment that will drastically alter MY life. It's hard imagine any idea more self absorbed or selfish than someone suggesting that you have children for THEM, when they have to do none of the work, have to pay nothing for it, and will not have their life altered anymore than they want it to be. 

"
48,I found it really challenging in India that often men wouldn't talk to me - I would ask a question and they'd answer my male travel partner. I'd pay and they'd give him the change. 
49,"Saw my ex-husband accidentally on someone's instagram feed a few months back. He got fat, started going bald, looked terrible, and had an ugly girlfriend. There was an extra skip in my step that day."
50,"I was (finally) moving out and the day I had chosen for moving she threw a temper tantrum, was screaming a ton of stuff about how I was abandoning the family, was going to be raped and murdered, and I wasn't grateful and I was a brat, etc etc, and turned around to leave, saying something about how she was going to take care of her children.

My younger sister and I pretty much raised them. My youngest siblings were born when I was fourteen and my mom just wasn't there for them. If she wasn't out drinking, she was high or sleeping at home, so she just wasn't there. When we was in school, they were sleeping, and from the time we got home until three or four in the morning, we was responsible for them, starting in high school. As they got older it got easier and they got reasonable sleeping schedules. I was still responsible for them, though. Hearing my mom say 'I'm going to go take care of *my* children!' Really set something off in me because the only time she ever takes responsibility for any of her kids is when she's trying to hurt someone. It really upsets me. I just screamed 'Finally!' after her.

She came running back and started punching me in the head and I hit her back. I was so scared because I never talked back to my mom, and I definitely hadn't ever hit her. My sister fought back once and my mom threatened to kill her, and I believed with complete certainty that she'd do it.

She backed off and looked so small, for the first time in my life. I was scared of what would happen but I realized that she wasn't going to kill me. She looked scared and confused and told me never to touch her again and ran out of the house. I cried.

I'm still terrified of her, of course. She's extremely manipulative and cruel, but I'm not afraid of her specifically beating/killing me anymore, and it's pretty fuckin cool."
51,"Yesterday, my linguistics class received their marked essays back. I was checking the comments on mine and found that I had left [this](http://i.imgur.com/4Qz9Pg3.jpg) in my essay and submitted it. Needless to say I was horrified."
52,Rachel and Joey grossed me out. 
53,"Good thing you didn't post that to r/relationships after the first date, they'd have told you to drop contact with him immediately. "
54,"I haven't needed to defend myself since taking the class, but the knife disarm was great for getting the TV remote away from someone because *no I am not watching ""How It's Made: Tractor Edition"" again goddamit.*"
55,"I wear a hijab, have for most of my life, and haven't felt any real animosity! Sure, there are second glances and too long stares from some but nothing too unbearable :)

My biggest worry was if my patients would feel uncomfortable around me (just a med student) but but they've been great! My concern was whether they'd feel uncomfortable or ask to see someone else, but no one has seemed surprised/unsettled and we've gotten along fabulously, alhamdulillah :) 

I consider it an integral part of me so I pretty much take it into consideration when getting dressed. Fashion is a huge part of my life so I make sure it *complements* my outfit or vice-versa if I'm rocking a particularly cool hijab :) 

*Edit--wrong use of compliment. Hijabs can't talk :)"
56,"Squat toilets. No matter how many times, I can't get used to them."
57,"my bra straps are very often visible. but hey, it's summer, i am physically uncomfortable if i don't wear a bra, and i'm gonna keep wearing tank tops because it's hot and my job doesn't include a professional dress code."
58,"Coming from Sweden and visiting Paris when I was 18, I was completely shocked by how aggressively men come on to you there. The constant catcalling and lewd remarks, and if you ever even for a split second meet someone's gaze, that's basically an invitation. I had men following me down the street and in to shops, hoping to...what? I don't know. It was crazy, and slightly terrifying."
59,Only if he's willing to slam his body down and wind it all around. 
60,Ron and Hermione. I just don't understand it.
61,i am so much more pro- brienne/jaime than brienne/tormund and i'm not sorry about it
62,Asks you about you instead of just talking about themselves and shows a genuine interest in what you are saying.
63,"My first fight in like 3rd grade, I was going to punch Jamie, she was being rude. So we got into fighting stance, I started at her and tripped on my shoe laces and fell to the grass. How did I recover? I curled up with my knees to my chin and rocked around for a second humming strangely then jumped up and  pranced around like a pony (literally). We didn't fight. I acted like I did it all on purpose even though it obviously wasnt. It was just the stupidest response. I hate it."
64,"The first few dates with my husband, I noticed he was treating me differently than any other dates had. He was getting to know me as a person, not just as a potential romantic partner. It truly was just like making a new friend. I didn't feel like he was counting down the seconds until he could make the first move. Takes a lot of stress out of the picture. He's a keeper."
65,"I was hooking up with a guy on and off for like 5 years.  Basically we had sex all the time and spent all our time together but weren't dating.  Because although he clearly wanted to be official, and asked, and told me he loved me and stuff, I was a huge ass and did not want to call him my boyfriend.  

So I kind of dragged him along forever, with the intention of going nowhere.  To be fair though, I'd been very clear I never wanted to date.

Anyway, a couple month ago he broke it off for good and now has a lovely new official girlfriend.  Ran into them at a bar we'd go to.  And I realized fuck I may have more feelings about it than intended."
66,"Speaking as a book reader and show watcher, I just love Tormund's infatuation and Brienne's obvious confusion about it. I mean, all her life she was mocked for her appearance to the point of being called ""Brienne the Beauty"" ironically, and now there is this hulking, savage Wildling giving her these adoring looks and deep sighs and she has no idea what to do about it, because she has never had a man actually look at her and be attracted to her for how she looks. 

I mean, I am still totally all about Jaime x Brienne, but damn do I love me some Tormund x Brienne side infatuation. I think Brienne deserves to have a moment of ""whoa, what is this, someone thinks I am attractive and they aren't mocking me??"" "
67,"&gt; And he's got the cat... I really fucking miss that cat.

:("
68,"My girlfriend passed away in late 2014, but I love telling people what happened when we met the first time because it makes them smile. 

First time I ever saw her I was coming out of a cafe when she walked into the back of me, hard, and spilt her coffee on my new shirt. I turned around and she just glared at me, and I remember thinking 'man she looks super pissed off, but those eyes are beautiful'. But I'd had a really bad day and she had too so we actually exchanged a few choice swear words before I stormed off and she flipped me the bird. 

The whole week I was thinking about this beautiful, stupid girl who didn't look where she was going and ruined my shirt. And then a week later I saw her in the same cafe sitting in the corner booth. I was going to go over and tell her that she'd ruined my shirt but when I actually walked over she was crying into her hands, because she'd just been fired she told me later. My heart totally melted and I forgot all about the coffee and why I was even mad in the first place. "
69,"I hate when people equate weight with beauty. ""Ugh, I'm fat."" ""No, you're beautiful!""

I didn't say I was ugly, I said I was fat. The two are not synonymous. 

Edit: Adding [this](https://imgur.com/gchEv2a) because as a fat person, it warms my heart. "
70,"Seriously, it's hot as shit. Like you're tapping into a very deep purpose for sex."
71,You dodged a fucking bazooka. 
72,"When you're playing Mario Party 8, if you're a guy character and land on a Bowser square he'll call you a loser or something, but if you're a girl he'll call you ""cutie"". Fuck you, Bowser. I'm not cute. I'll fucking stab your face next time you take that patronizing tone with me. Turtle-shelled ugly face asshole."
73,"Pedestrian etiquette. I'm from the U.S. I worked in Korea for a year - Seoul, specifically. Considering there are so many people squished so tightly together there, it does make sense that 1) you're not going to be too bothered when you brush/hit someone when walking past and 2) you're screwed if you try to hold the door open for someone - you'll just be holding the door for literally everyone. So I certainly don't begrudge them that. It just took getting used to - in the U.S., I tend to veer out of of the way of oncoming traffic out of politeness. In Korea I had to learn to give no fucks, like everyone else. Which I did.

Funnily enough, I was walking during the daytime with some friends through Itaewon (essentially the neighborhood most highly populated with foreigners). A few guys passed by us on the sidewalk (they were either American or Canadian), and one ended up bumping me as he walked past. I literally thought nothing of it because by this time I was well-trained. But a second or two later, I hear from behind me, ""Oh, sorry! Excuse me!"" Like, hilariously, that dude had had a delayed response about it. My only guess is that he suddenly realized we were both westerners and back home his action would have been rude. Even more hilariously (to me at least), I was so fucking impressed. My mind's going, ""Oh, what a gentleman!""

Then I came back home to the U.S. and realized I was now an asshole pedestrian. I didn't even realize until I was walking into a bookstore with my mother, and a stranger directly behind us. I let that door slam shut right in that stranger's face. My mother says my name in a horrified tone and only then do I realize what I've done. After that I had to consciously re-train myself for American pedestrian etiquette."
74,First thing I thought was 'l want to take this one home' and then I did. He said he thought the same thing when he met me but I had to make all the moves because he didn't think he had a chance. 
75,"Mine's a little counter intuitive, but I hate when people insist I'm *not* fat. This almost always comes from fit/hot women (read: the people who say it are almost always fit/hot women, rather than fit/hot women almost always say this). If I mention that I'm working to lose some weight they'll say ""Whaaaaat? Noooooo, you're so beautiful!"" and they're always the ones who say stuff like ""You know how to get a bikini body? Put a bikini on your body."" I recognize they're trying to be supportive, but it feels like anything but. I know I'm beautiful, but I also know I'm overweight. I don't need anyone to pretend I'm not. And the bikini comment, and others like it, are irritating because it becomes very evident that those people don't know what it's like to want to cover your body. "
76,"Leslie Knope from Parks and Recreation! She's smart, funny, and values friendship above all. That show will always put me in a good mood. "
77,"For reference, I am a scientist and I'm cute, but I'll never be a bombshell. 

I was dating an engineer that was transferred out of state. He wanted to marry me and was begging me to move with him. Instead I broke it off. A few month later his Facebook status is he is dating a new person... a beauty queen from Texas. Her profile picture was her shaking hands with Obama. Seriously. He posted photos of their great dates in the new city he lived in and in all of them she was stunning and dressed better on her normal days than I dress for weddings and stuff. All I could think is ""What the hell was he doing with me?!"""
78,"As a fancy rat lover I just cannot watch Ratatouille.

Remy is a goddamn blue dumbo. There is no way a rat with those genetics could survive in the wild. And the human character guy (forgot his name) bases his whole business around an animal that even with the best breeding would only live for 2-4 years total, but Remy is a BLOODY BLUE DUMBO that will likely need a lot of vet care and have a much shorter life expectancy. Don't forget Remy was an adult when they met, so he had like 2 years left to live probably.

I can suspend my disbelief to accept that entrepreneurial rats can cook, but you can't tell me that a wild blue dumbo can run a successful business in the long term. That is a step too far."
79,"Right?! I'm dating a guy now and I was venting to him about work. Then I remembered how much other guys sucked at listening so I apologized for being so negative. 

He was like, ""No please. You need to vent and I like listening to you."" 

I want to marry this dude already haha"
80,Because I would've shat my pants watching that as a kid.
81,"&gt; His thin slimey peenie was poking me in the butt.


I clenched."
82,"He would not wait until after graduation.  ""Now or never"".  He felt I needed to make our relationship a ""priority"" and that by not dropping out my last year, I was being selfish and not putting ""us"" first. 

He'd graduated the year before and took a job a few hours away (not even in another state), and wanted me to join him there right away.  

I didn't want to drop out after I'd already started my last year and he just brushed it off and said I could finish up later. (Which would have been hard to do)

Eventually, I realized he really just didn't want me to earn my degree.  I decided that being with someone who wasn't supportive of a reasonable and ordinary goal (graduating college) was not going to be supportive of any other goals I'd have. 

"
83,"I'm a bit skeeved out by the idea of having underage beauty contests to begin with, but not having swimsuits in there is at least a little less skeevy"
84,"""I don't judge anyone anywhere ever and have no prejudices of any sort ever and am super tolerant of all always and see all sides of every argument ever."""
85,"I tend to force myself to focus on cringey moments so that the cringe feeling fades and it just becomes funny. Telling other people as if it's a funny story always helps.

The cringey moment I'm currently willing to fade is how I got too drunk at my friend's engagement party and asked a lot of people whether they partake in anal fisting. I tend to bring up taboo subjects when drunk in a very jokey manner but I am relentless. Or at least that's what my memory makes me feel."
86,"Take a photo of a group of people who were posing, like I was doing them a massive favor.... With my own phone. (I was drunk). Didn't say anything, just smiled when I was done, nodded, and walked off.

Oh god why!?"
87,"I was a teaching assistant for Statistics in college. I held a review session on the day of the midterm, and I was answering questions left and right. The smartest student in the class asked me something and I gave her the answer. She seemed skeptical but I explained it and she was satisfied. 

Then during the exam, I was bubbling in the Scantron key and saw a question that made me realize I had given her the exact wrong answer, and that my explanation had made absolutely no sense. After the exam, I ran the tests through the Scantron machine and went through the results. The student had answered just one question wrong and of course it was that one. I shamefully went up to the professor to explain what happened so that I could adjust her grade. He was extremely by the book and required excruciating detail about the events before he begrudgingly allowed me to make the change, and only after I made sure that everyone else who had attended the review session had answered correctly. I also had to personally tell the student about the correction so she wouldn't think the wrong answer was right just because she got a point for it. Every exam after that, the professor would ask me if the Scantrons were ""alright this time."""
88,"My college bf had an issue with drinking too much and peeing the bed. ""A phase!"", I told myself. Recently (ten years later), I hung out with him and some old great friends at a wedding. He got wasted, passed out on the couch of my hotel room, got up in the middle of the night, peed in my luggage and denied the whole thing. At least he has graduated to the corner. "
89,"Not me, but someone I know did this. Her kid is now 4. She's pretty depressed. Postpartum depression specifically was really really hard on her. She also had a pretty traumatic birth. I mean, she does all the mom things. Her daughter isn't neglected. But she's sad. She doesn't say that she's sad anymore, I think she just adopted it as part of her being around year 2. 

Her mom is around a lot. Helps take care of the kid. Babysits frequently for our coffee dates or whatever. I'm not sure if her mom realizes how much pressure she put on her daughter to have the kid, like that she's the main reason. But at least she's not the stop-by-twice-a-year grandma. Her mom seems much more interested in spending time with her daughter than she does. It's the little things, like making a game out of putting on the girls shoes, ect. 

Her husband is moderately helpful, but I gathered that he wasn't really especially wanting to be a parent just yet either. But then again his dad was a pretty checked-out parent too, so he might just not realize he's not very involved. 

I guess they're ok with their life, but they're not going on family vacations (though who really wants to family vacation with a toddler?)or taking family trips to the park and instagraming it or anything. "
90,"I left ""blah blah blah I for real cannot do this end my life"" and a bunch of random letters and numbers in a lab report, once. My professor circled it and just wrote HAHAHA! in red marker and then let me rewrite that part of the lab report after class. She wrote ""much better and more scholarly"" on the rewrite. She was pretty funny. "
91,"I was with a guy a few years ago and we went to see a local band play. My first boyfriend (of 4 years too) was there, and we clinked beers as to say hello since it was loud in there. It was awkward but whatever. 

As we left, I started I said to my boyfriend ""did you see me say hi to that guy in there?"" And he said ""oh yea, that sad homeless dude?""

He really, really looked homeless. 100%. But I didn't really see it because I guess he always looked that way?? 

But I also heard from people that he was living in a tent in his mother's back yard of his own volition, and even tried to dig a pipe for ""toilet plumbing"" to his tent. Why. He was mid twenties FWIW."
92,"A lot of my friends are incredibly quick to bash on Christianity for any little thing and basically act like anyone that views themselves as a Christian is below them. At the same time, they're extremely quick to defend Muslims despite similar beliefs and equally similar faults. I'm atheist for the record, but it just irritates me that they turn a blind eye to all of the other monotheistic religions. "

95,"I'm a print designer and I had to send out a few 100 items for print at a local shop. My boyfriend and I went into the shop for me to talk to them. The shop was owned by an middle aged guy and he talked to my boyfriend, even though I handed him the files and started the conversation. 

I asked about paper options and if I could see some printed and the guy made an off handed comment like ""Well, it's not like picking paint for the house, once you pick one you have to stick with it."" And laughed while looking at my boyfriend. It was obviously a remark about women being indecisive and he was hoping my boyfriend would join in on the joke with him. 

My boyfriend just said ""You need to talk to her, she's the one doing business with you"" "
96,"I got genital herpes from my boyfriend at the time, who I lost my virginity to, when I was 16. The nurse asked how many sexual partners I'd had, I said one. She then asked how many partners my partner had had. He told me that I had been his only, so that's what I told her. She laughed at me. I was in so much pain, emotionally and physically, and she fucking laughed. I am accepting of the fact that I have to live with herpes for the rest of my life, but thinking back on her reaction still fucking hurts tbh."
97,"This. My boyfriend told me once, in the first few months, that he'd gotten 'my' orange juice. I had no clue what the guy was talking about, but hey, orange juice is always nice! Turned out I had talked to him about how I really liked the Innocent branding. Their bottles used to also state what's not in them; shopping carts and rubber ducks and stuff. He used to study something marketingish (which he hates) and it probably came up in a conversation about that. He remembered, even when I didn't. I was pretty impressed.

He knows what chocolate I like, he knows what fruits I like, which side of the bed is my favourite and regularly messages me with news articles he thinks would interest me. He's not been wrong yet. And because he listens, I feel like he knows me a lot better than most people do."
98," He got engaged and I realized he had been cheating on her with me (I didn't know she existed)

Yeah glad that ended for me... they're married now and I'm really curious as to how long it will last. Poor girl had a promise ring too."
99,"In my experience, there are way more women helping men who should fail through college than anyone likes to talk about. I knew of girlfriends writing papers for boyfriends, two women helping one dude write his masters thesis even after this dude was told by his professors before they let him into the masters program to go to the writing center for help when writing his papers. Bonus, these women were in the same masters program so helping his ass was just more stress on them. Hell, even scheduling the meetings for group projects fell on the ladies."
100,"Alright, some problems with Ross in general:

* He has severe anger issues, demonstrated over and over throughout the show
* He perpetuates stereotypical gender roles - He gets angry at Rachel for hiring a male nanny (with the infamous line ""What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? It's like if a woman wanted to be...""), and he gets really pissed about Carol letting Ben play with ""girls"" toys when that's what the child wanted to play with
* He is very homophobic - Ranging from his constant belittling of Carol's relationship with a woman to his defensiveness at any implication he might not be straight to his ""no homo"" type response to hugs and the like
* On a related note - He's a posterboy for toxic masculinity - I don't know if I even need to go into this further after the last two points 
* He's absolutely condescending to everyone - He makes it damn clear over and over again that the things *he* is interested in are the only legitimate things to care about and if people don't know about them they must be inferior in some way - He is especially patronising to Joey and Phoebe
* He literally says ""Not all men are like that"" when he's supposed to be listening to a friend's problem

And problems with Ross specifically in regards to Rachel:

* He is literally the epitome of Nice Guys - He has been wanting to get into Rachel's pants since she was a teenager and whines about how she dates other guys while he's just ""a friend"" - to the point that Ross Geller's weird relationship with Rachel is what actually coined the term ""friend zone"" to begin with - He is the original Friend Zoned Nice Guy
* He is incredibly controlling - From trying to stop her from dating other people while they're not together to actually telling her she needs to realise her job is ""just a job"" and quit because he doesn't see her enough and doesn't feel like he has a real girlfriend
* He is extremely jealous - This is obvious enough when they're *not* together, but when they *are* together, he bugs her constantly about potentially being interested in other men and actually goes so far as to show up at her work place to essentially mark his territory in front of her male boss so he knows who she ""belongs"" to
* He is also emotionally manipulative and abusive - He blames Rachel for every problem they have, he treats her as a possession (even when they're not in a relationship), he cheats on her and then blaming her for it, he genuinely negs her and tells her he likes her ""in spite of"" all of the flaws he sees in her, he refuses to divorce her when she wants to separate and even goes so far as to hide the fact that they're still married from her so he can hold it over her later, etc.
* He's completely does not respect Rachel or her feelings at any point in the show. He doesn't show any empathy towards her, he doesn't seem to care about her as a person at all, just as an object he wants to own."

118,"My final breaking point was over hubcaps.


Back when I was in college, I had a little Nissan that had lost two of its hubcaps over time. Not a big deal, I didn't really care. But my mom kept telling me that it looked trashy, so to appease her, we went shopping together and bought a cheapie set of $20 plastic hubcaps and put them on my car.


A week later, I came home after a long day of work and discovered that one of my new hubcaps was missing. I knew I had lost it during my commute home -- it had been on the car that morning.


My mom called me that evening and I casually mentioned it to her, thinking it was kind of funny that my car just didn't want hubcaps. Instead of laughing, my mom flipped her lid. She demanded that I go back and scour the side of the interstate for the hubcap, and that I was ""demented"" and ""deranged"" for not caring very much about losing a cheap plastic hubcap.


This was so typical of my mom -- valuing stupid material things over people and hurling nasty verbal abuse at me because I didn't agree -- that I just couldn't take it any more. First I explained to her that looking for a hubcap in the dark on the side of the interstate is very dangerous. Would she rather lose $5 or her daughter? Was that $5 piece of plastic really that important to her?


Then I told her that my priorities were straight, and that I was neither demented nor deranged like she was always telling me that I was. I explained that I would no longer accept that kind of behavior from her, and would not be speaking to her again until she had an apology.


A week or so later, my mom called and apologized. I reiterated that I would no longer tolerate abuse from her when our priorities didn't align, and she seemed to understand. And you know? She backed off. Ever since then, she's treated me with respect as an adult and hasn't denigrated me when we disagree."

130,"Both times I got pregnant, we were very actively trying and I was charting. The times we had sex when I was fertile for me was pretty much like normal sex but occasionally I would think ""maybe we are making a baby!"" That's slightly weird, but didn't ruin it or anything. I do also think since there were certain days we knew we had to have sex to conceive, it felt a little more like a chore than something spontaneous and fun, but once we got into it it was more normal."
131,"Was biking with my friend along the beach and saw an ex biking with his friend. We are a good distance apart, but made eye contact, so I smiled and waved, and instead of waving back, he high-fived his buddy and said ""I hit that."" Bullet dodged. "
132,"I'm not sure I can say it was pressure from my parents so much as...everyone? Society, I guess. ""It's different when they're your own"" / ""The first time you see them you'll be filled with a love like no other"" etc. etc. I've never been a maternal person or really liked kids (not disliked either) but my husband and I had been married for five years, we knew our families would be ecstatic, and it felt like what we were *supposed* to do next.

(I know--shitty, shitty reasoning, but anything you can say to me I've already said to myself many times over, believe me.)

I got pregnant much quicker than we expected and it wasn't until late in the pregnancy that it started becoming real to me in a very bad way. Everyone around us was excited and elated and I was increasingly filled with dread. Birth was a horrible experience and when I held my son for the first time I felt...nothing. Exactly what I'd feared and expected. I was hit with severe post-partum depression (although I can't separate out exactly what was PPD and what was just ""I didn't want a kid enough"") and we basically had to uproot our lives to move closer to family and get the support we needed.

My husband stepped up *massively* for our family and he is my champion and favorite person in the world. He never once blamed me or resented me and just wanted to find solutions to make sure everyone was happy and healthy. He's the primary caregiver of our son and he's amazing at it, much more of a natural than I ever could have been. The thing I regret most about leaving our old lives behind is all the time we used to be able to spend together. I still miss that every day.

Did it get better? Yeah. My son is 18 months and the difference between now and a year ago is massive. He's running around and babbling and playing and doing his funny little butt dance when he hears music. I can't in all honesty say I *love* him yet, love takes time for me and he needs to be more of a *person* before I can get there, I think. But I kiss him and cuddle him and read books and play and make faces and chase him and throw a party when I see him just to make him smile. I will never, ever let him know how hard this has been for me--it's not his fault his mom was an idiot and didn't think this through enough.

I know it'll keep getting better as he gets older and I know I'll love him someday. We have a ton of family support and he has love coming at him from all sides, so I'm not worried about his future. I just want to caution anyone who has kids for any reason other than that *they* really, really want to, or buys into the line of ""it's different when it's your own""--it may not be. And it's a long, hard road clawing your way up from that."
133,"That quite a lot of people have pretty bad 'toilet related' problems that they just don't talk about because poop is gross or ""You're just not meant to talk about it"" so they end up living more stressful lives as a result of it.

First of all, 120 pounds is not an unhealthy goal weight for someone who is 5'2"". Second, I'll be sure to tell my doctor that you think the goal she set for me is unhealthy. I'm sure that will change everything."

My girls birthday was coming in a month. I asked if we could cruise REI to look at camping gear i love. She occupied herself looking at the discount jackets and was trying on a purplish one that fit her well. She said ""ive wanted a thin down jacket for a year and promised myself id get one"". Then she put it back and we left because she didnt like it QUITE enough to pay for it. 

Next day while she was at work, i drove 45 minutes back to the store, talked to the lady who knew her shit about jackets, and she really liked that one. So i bought it for my girl and drove 45 min back home in time to get to work. Sat on it for a month till her birthday. 

The look on her face when she opened it at her birthday party in front of all her friends? Worth it. "
140,"Ugh, you reminded me of the time I submitted a paper with [this](https://67.media.tumblr.com/f2d7ac97b53d5f7e4b9c364527bb015f/tumblr_inline_o4vyiwyW3U1typ855_540.jpg) picture of Zac Efron where the conclusion should have been. I had two copies saved on my computer: the rough draft I had sent to a friend to proofread--just to make sure my interpretation of the material made sense--and the final draft. Unfortunately, I did not do a very good job of naming them clearly to differentiate which was which. 

The kicker is that my final draft actually had a decent conclusion that I actually spent a decent amount of time writing! I don't like writing conclusion paragraphs--to be honest I didn't really like writing this paper as a whole--and Zefron seemed like a natural way to make the process less miserable. 

*Thankfully* my professor was this amazing old German dude who was endlessly amused by American pop culture (even if he didn't quite understand it), and called my, ahem, creative conclusion, ""quite the Sunday treat while grading papers."""
141,"My husband saw this question and brought it to me so I could share with you ladies how I had three boys, without trying. Im older then most of you Im sure, at 67 I have raised three sons of my own and 22 foster and at risk children for different amounts of time. I grew up Roman Catholic and soon learned I liked sex not just to have kids and keep my husband from straying as a ""good"" wife should but because I enjoyed the orgasm. My first pregnancy took forever and I was doing everything ""correct"" as my physician told me (over a cigarette in the exam room none the less) I was healthy and just needed to heed gods plan!! I was doing my chart and temperature and after every orgasm by my husband I would kick him off and shoot my legs in the air hands supporting my back and sing the star spangled banner. I was told this was the precise time needed so gravity would hurry the sperm floatilla to my egg and combat could begin! We kept this up for 16 months, finally I could do no more. Sex was like washing the car, a chore that ended up with a wet mess that you just needed to do again in a week. So we just gave up, well my husband was sent to NJ for his work and I got to go to Atlantic City. In those days Atlantic City was beautiful and a real couples destination! We trotted off like newly weds and took advantage of everything Atlantic City had to offer. So now the dirty part, my husband was always 2 seconds from ready I had developed my own ways to get into the act and I actually became a pioneer of the oral act.(and quite enjoyed the giving and getting) He had begged of me all day to give him an oral session and to be honest I wasn't much for it as I had a sore tooth, so I took the opportunity to offer up a naughty romp behind the tall grass on the ocean beach at dusk. Well the Mr. was all about that I tell you! We snuck down and raced behind the dune and had our fun with my new R.H. Macy stockings and sassy bikini cut lady's brief's I felt like quite the temptress! A hurried session of love making ended with sand in unmentionable places and my husband in need of a submarine sandwich. We carried on to find his food and never gave a second thought to our dalliance in the tall grass till 2 weeks after I got in and in my daily duty's realized something that always was well was not! Back to my physician and with a lucky strike for him and I, the information on my new family members pending arrival was given to me. No special calendars, no temperatures and I certainly wasn't going to ruin a four dollar permanent to roll up on my back with legs in the air to sing the star spangled banner. The birth was natural at home (not by choice, snowstorm) and I had my first of three. The next year we elected again to put the effort to the latest methods and try to increase our family size. Again over a year of heart ache and misery with the advise of my physician being the same and my priest of ""be it Gods will"". The summer came and my husband had purchased a small sail boat for our family to get to the bay and clam and fish as he did when he was a boy. We had decided to spend the night on a small sand spit island and as soon as my son was asleep my husband was looking for love! More sneaking off in the tall grass and making submarine sandwich with the same result 4 weeks later my middle boy was born. We elected for the hospital and everything went well. Time was left for me to recover and with nursing and one boy just getting off the breast mommy was worn out. My husband was very mindful of never wanting Irish twins like his family was full of so we decided two was sufficient and he would get the surgery. Years pass and I had a full home with my two boys and my foster kids seemed someone was always sick or hurt and my husband worked in a constant arc of time, he was always fearfull of one of his charges or I wanting for something so every shift he could was worked. We decided to take our first real vacation. 1982 we booked passage to Bermuda on a cruise, top of the line everything! I loved Bermuda but I didn't know till several weeks after we returned that we went as two and returned as three! I never took my suit off on any beach! Im still not sure how he got me, with the surgery and us being technically careful but that little Irish pecker found a way. My third happy healthy boy was born in 83. SO the point Im making is take heart ladies and remember conception isn't on your time table and sometimes when you think the door is closed its wide open. What really matters is your all safe and loved and healthy.  Good luck and be blessed, Mrs. C3H8pro"

 So, he contacts me and at first acts totally normal, but then wants to rehash some stuff from our relationship....more than 10 years ago. He ends up sending me this long rant about how his life sucks and it was all my fault. 

Yeah, so glad I dodged that bullet.

We've been spending the night together every night for the last couple of weeks and in October we're planning for him to move in.  I've been seeing him since March.  It feels very sudden, and yet it feels totally right.

The most upsetting thing is everyone telling me that I will change my mind and do it again. It seems that all the only children in the world can't possibly exist. "
172,"Most, if not all, white people in the U.S. (myself included) have culturally enforced racial bias. Tell that to most white people though, and they freak the fuck out. 

Also, most people give to charity out of selfishness and a desire to show off rather than empathy or compassion. Working in a non-profit, you'd think I'd grow to have more faith in human kindness, but I'm actually way more cynical about it."

182,"Aww I know I'm in the minority on this but I loved Rachel and Joey and HATE Ross and Rachel. Ross talks to Rachel like she's a child and neither have any respect for each other's careers, but a doctor on a soap opera would have been perfect for Rachel and Joey was really interested in fashion. I think the writers should have come up with a better reason to end the Joey relationship because Rachel couldn't stop laughing the first time she hooked up with Ross either."
183,I hated the ending of The Hunger Games. 
184,"When I was a little girl, my mother made me leave my grandparents house (they raised me) to move to Florida with her fiancé that I had only met 2-3 times.
My mom didn't care about my feelings on the subject at all, and she forced me into the car the day after Christmas with my grandma running after me telling me how much she loved me. I was afraid because my mother was an alcoholic, and so was her fiancé. Both of them were abusive. In fact, he beat her in front of me one of the times I was visiting them and she told me he had just had a bad day.

I outgrew everything I brought with me, and my mom never took me shopping. Everything in that house smelt like cigarettes, and to this day I can remember how strong the smell was. I never bathed, and I was force fed all the food I would try and didn't like. ""Mommy I really don't like fish, can I just eat my sides?"" Nope, I was forced to stay at the table until 3am sometimes until all of it was gone. Didn't matter, I'd puke it up anyways.

I didn't do well in school at all, in fact I didn't do any homework or projects. I was in second grade and we had a weekly reading assignment that I never did because it required parent signatures and my mom never cared to sign them in the beginning, so I never did them. The teacher didn't notice the bruises, but said my behavior was due to moving. Nobody ever asked me what was wrong. I was scarred hearing my mom and him screw every single morning. I can still hear the moans. It makes me sick.

I was beaten weekly, and my step dad would pinch my inner thighs so much they'd bruise. I told him to stop and that I didn't like it, but he never did. I was deathly afraid of spiders and I'll never forget him pushing me into a banana spider web. What I did forget was what would happen at night, and it took me until I was 20 years old in therapy to discover I was sexually abused. 

When I did get out of this situation and came home, my mother blamed me for everything that happened. She would still beat me, but all I ever wanted was for her to love me. It never took much to trigger her, even saying I didn't like the random men coming over would get me punched. The worst part was we were living with my grandparents, and they saw everything and never did anything. They were afraid of her.

I was abused until I was a junior in high school. My mom tried so hard to show me she wanted to have a relationship with me, but every time something good would happen something bad would. When she'd hit me, she'd take me shopping. I actually didn't mind the beatings because I got to spend time with her, with her actually loving me. She started offering me weed and booze to be a cool mom, but I did those with friends and ended up having a drinking and drug problem until I was 20.

When I was 18, that was it. 18 was the magic number that made it so that she could never hurt me again. I told her I'd call the police if she ever laid a hand on me. She took away my health insurance, never gave me a graduation party and didn't buy my prom dress, and showed up late to my high school graduation because she was hungover. Refused to sign for student loans, so I couldn't go to college. Then she moved, and I was with my grandparents. I was so confused, but then I started going to therapy, and that's when I had a breakthrough that none of what happened was okay despite her preachings that all children were treated this way.

I was diagnosed with bipolar depression and PTSD. They put me on medications. My therapist thinks my mom has bipolar disorder, and that's why she triggers all the time. I seriously thought about killing my mom because of how much she had damaged my life, but I was just fed up with seeing her or interacting with her in any way. 

I got a serious boyfriend who helped me get sober and actually pushed me into going to therapy. I was a broken young woman at 19, not just from how my mother treated me, but even from previous romantic relationships and dead friendships. I felt love for the first time in my life, and two years later I'm still with him with plans to get married.

It took me almost 20 years to realize that I was fed up with my abuse, and the breaking point was when I reached clarity from my therapist. I wanted my mommy, but I realized I never had one. I was a little girl who grew up without love, and despite suicide attempts at the ages of 12 and 15, made it to 21. I no longer trying to win my mothers affections, in fact, I barely speak to her if at all. She calls me for money, and sometimes I give it to her because I feel sorry for her. Sorry that she is alone, and still believes that what her little girl went through wasn't her fault. 

I currently have one year of college under my belt, but can't go back yet due to finances. I work 40 hours a week while trying to deal with all of this. I still take meds, I still have episodes of flashbacks, and I still lock every door behind me thinking that somebody will try to come in and hurt me. It's been a majority of my lifetime, but I feel as if I'm starting to find happiness and security.

Sorry, I kinda let it all out, but I figured it was essential in seeing how hard it was to escape my abuse. They only people who know all of this is my boyfriend and my therapist. Did I have a breaking point? Did I stop taking the abuse? Only when I was able to escape."

It wasn't and that person was calling her ""papi"".  It was a joke between friends.  She was very angry.  "

195,"My biggest culture shock is kind of ridiculous/embarrassing:

I grew up in suburban Utah which is very non-diverse.
My town was 97% white and 90% Mormon. The few minorities we had were either Asian or Hispanic.

I went to Virginia for a summer for an internship when I was 17 and we were housed in the dorms at a historically black college.
I know it sounds stupid, but it was the first time I really spent any time around a lot of black people, and it was a shock to me.

It was the first time I got jolted out of my comfort zone and realized how out-of-touch I'd been. It took a few days to get comfortable with seeing a different mix of people than I was used to.

I've been to Europe and gotten lost in places where I don't speak the language and tried peeing in a hole in the ground, but those two months I spent in Virginia are always the thing I come back to when I think about really ""getting"" the diversity in our country.

I'm  glad I went because it helped me realize that I was really naive about a lot of things and got me thinking about a lot of things.
I'm still naive, but now I know it and try to think outside my own comfort zone."
196,"The Book circlejerk.  I often see posts that basically say ""I read books, therefore I am better than you"".  Novels are ultimately a form of entertainment.  While they are better for putting us in the place of the characters, expressing thoughts, and ultimately showing us a specific point of view, there is nothing inherently deep nor thought provoking in the act of reading a generic book.  Anyone can publish a book and there are shelves upon shelves of pulpy romance or mysteries that a person with a state-sanctioned 6th-grade reading level can get through.  And don't get me wrong, i don't think that everyone who reads should only read Pynchon and Vonnegut.  There are a lot of thought-provoking children's books out there.  I just don't think you should put people down because they don't enjoy reading when there are so many different forms of entertainment out there and so many other ways of broadening your mind.  I also think it's gotten to the point where people are just trying to show off when quite frankly, your reading material isn't that impressive (but it's still ok because you can like what you like).

197,The Doctor and River Song. Just no. No no no. I don't like her character. The whole idea is just bonkers. It seems too stretched. I was ok with her as a one off character in the library - ok.

206,"*Twilight* pisses me off because it actually had potential. If it had been written by a more self-aware writer, or one who was just better, period, it could have been superlative literary horror.

She makes a permanent and irreversible decision at 19 that she doesn't have the capacity to understand, and someone with a more able pen really could have done something with that, and with Bella's growing realization of what that decision actually means."

I'm glad I don't have to deal with expectations of masculinity and everything that comes with it - jobs you're judged for doing, clothes you wear, affection you give, emotions you're allowed to express. I think women have a greater amount of emotional and social freedom, even job freedom (but less *career* freedom). 

I'm also glad I don't have to deal with the burden of not being able to decide what happens in the case of unwanted pregnancy. I don't think I'd ever have sex if I wanted kids at some point, but not at the moment (because if I wanted kids at some point, I wouldn't be able to get a vasectomy). Especially in countries where men have to take on the responsibility of financial support of a baby they didn't want from the beginning, and the judgment that comes if they don't want to participate in parenthood."

I could go on but we've all come across this guy.

I kind of wish I did take up hijab since I love my religion but personally it's hard for me, since I like how I look without it.

She went a few hours drive away for college, which was quite rare for young women from her rural community.  He showed at her dorm room, late in her sophomore year of college.  J asked her to drop out of college, marry him, and raise horses with him.

She said no, and that was the end of their romantic relationship.  Her father was pretty upset.  I think she and J remained friends.  My mom met my dad in grad school, a few years later. J was supposed to be in the wedding party but had to skip due to a family emergency.

Then, we did not find any food because the everything was closed in this small town. When we got back to the hotel after charging the car, we found that our friends had left us no blankets/comforters to sleep under. We had one sheet and used towels on top of that.

262,"Walking around in Egypt, I was shocked at how easily 90% of people out and about were male. It just felt like a bizarro man world like something out of Sliders. They were also very unfriendly yet at the same time trying to sell stuff/convince us to go to their cafe/shop/restaurant. 

I was living in Japan at the time, where a lot of expats get cynical and whiny about Japanese culture because of things like being offered a fork instead of chopsticks. In Egypt, however, sticking out wasn't just a minor inconvenience, it was very unsettling and sometimes downright scary. I seriously cut back my complaining about the typical gaijin problems after that trip. "

266,"I said not right now and explained why.  We had a long talk about it on and off for about a month.  He kind of knew that might happen, given that I didn't at the time like the idea of marriage.  When he asked me to marry him it was just an over the dinner table at home conversation for that reason, not a formal all-or-nothing proposal, and he wasn't particularly shocked by my response at all."

270,"I'm from southeast asia and maybe it's coloured my experience but I've always expected that people from western countries will tend to experience culture shock more than people from areas like SEA. I think it's because the western worlds gets much more media representation. 

I'm pretty well travelled (over 50 countries) and I think the American tipping culture was my biggest shock. I was pretty young then and yes I have seen it in movies but I assumed it's what rich people do or something people do to reward good service. I couldn't wrap my head around the fact that service people were underpaid and had to survive from what is basically handouts from customers. It made budgeting all weird in my head, same with shopping because tax is not included in price tags."
271,"Regularly with old biddies at my office. Especially any work day that's fresh off a holiday. Conversations go as follows:  
  
*Old Broad:* How was your 4th of July?  
  
*Me:* Good, we went to my girlfriend's family's cottage with her whole family, had a good time.  
  
*Old Bird:* Oh it's so nice to have such close friends, to spend holidays together! And with her *family* **too**!! 
  
*Me (thankfully in my head):* Yes, Carol, it **is** nice to have such close friends we have a shared bank account and touch each other's vaginas."
272,"My ex and I are still pretty close, we text on a regular basis and probably talk monthly, but he definitely ""won"" the breakup.

He lives alone in a very nice suburb of Los Angeles with a very good job. He's happy, successful and very secure as well as incredibly handsome. 

Me on the other hand recently divorced from a 13 year marriage (no kids, didn't want them) with a live-in boyfriend with a six year old son. Decent job, but nothing spectacular and I'm fat... Like doubled my weight in my marriage kind of fat. "
273,"Every girl he's dated since has looked like me. He got fat and painted a confederate flag on his truck. 

I've mentioned him before: the guy I tried four times to get rid of. "
274,I cannot upvote this enough. Also perfectly shaved legs and armpits on things like The Walking Dead. Do they really expect me to believe that when faced with certain death at the hands of zombies women are shaving their armpits and legs?? Cause I sure as hell would not be dealing with that. 
275,"I worry about discipline more than motivation. But reminding myself ""You'll be glad you went when you're done,"" works for getting me out for a run or yoga class."

278,"Walked into the local dying mall years ago (long since bulldozed), and my ex that cheated on me was walking out of a pizza shop where she had just bought a slice.

She had her eyebrows plucked down to about 1 micon wide, and was wearing thigh high boots ...

And our eyes met and ... I pretended not to recognize her.

 "
279,"Getting random boners.  
Being physically strong and tough. That body builder/swoldier physique that is really popular seems practically unobtainable and torturous to maintain. And if you can't pick up some dumb weights then you're weak, pathetic and unmanly.  
And on that same path, having mental problems is so stigmatised with men. Pain isn't softness. And softness isn't weakness. "
280,"Wow, grandkids are not the prize you get for raising children. Stable, self-supporting, productive members of society are what you get for raising children well. What if your kids don't want children? I've told my kids that I hope for grandpets at least, and they can fully expect for me to be an overly attached grandpetparent, but I can't imagine demanding for them to have kids just to please me. That's terrible."

282,"Bella and Edward. I've only read the first book so maybe it gets better, but I thought he was often abrasive with her. And his habit of sneaking into her bedroom so he could gaze upon her while she slept struck me as pretty creepy."
283,"There's a few.

• I was a teenager at church, leading the choir, and I sneezed a giant, slimy, snotty booger onto the floor in front of everyone
• I was at church again and I was supposed to recite a bible verse. I looked at the crowd, forgot what to say so I smiled. It didn't come to me so I giggled. It still didn't come to me so I started laughing, and slowly like a wave of your worst public speaking nightmares a chuckle spread through the crowd. Then I started kind of laughing hysterically and everyone was laughing. Then we were all laughing and the tears were streaming down my face and then I had a panic attack. 
• I wasn't feeling well, so I went to the local pharmacy. I vomited the cherry coke and French fries up from the night before in front of both the entrance and the exit doors. People saw. They were almost as horrified as I was.
• It was summer, I was wearing a bandeau bra (strapless kind of bra) under a sheer top. I realized after walking for quite a while, maybe 10 minutes, that the bra had slipped down under my sheer top giving everyone driving by a chance to peek at my ta-tas.
"
284,"I write as a hobby, and near the beginning of our relationship, my boyfriend asked me to tell me about the book I was working on. I told him about it in all sorts of detail, and he has ADHD so I kinda assumed he'd tune out or something. He listened the whole way through, and when I finished, asked ""Wait, what happens next?"" When I told him I hadn't finished planning the next part, he asked me to tell him everything I was thinking. He's not a reader at all, but he cared about this because it meant so much to me.

Pretty sure that's when I started to fall in love. Caring about your interests is such an amazing thing in an SO."
285,"Amy and Rory from *Doctor Who.* Now, I LOVED this period of the show and it was largely down to these two because I just loved to hate on their relationship. Amy was a horrible, *horrible* person. The way she treated her husband was absolutely appalling. She didn't seem to fall in love with him until towards the very end, she spent a large part of their relationship constantly trying to fuck her imaginary friend, she relentlessly belittles him and she seems to frequently hit him (in one episode, he tells a harmless little joke and immediately flinches saying ""the last time I said something like that, you threw a shoe at me""....that looks like domestic abuse to me!)

Meanwhile lovely, steadfast, lovesick old Rory is nothing but loyal, knows she'll never love him as much as she loves The Doctor and (frequently) dies for her as well as guards her for thousands of years. He really deserved so much better than he got. "

288,The day one of my brothers sought help for being suicidal and she flew into a rage because she felt he did not consider how it would make her look to others....because she was afraid he might make her out to look like a bad mom to the medical staff treating him.

292,Oh gosh.... it seemed so forced. 
293,"I'm glad that if I'm ever a victim of domestic violence, people probably won't laugh at me. I'm also happy that people won't say that my gender can't be raped. "
294,"Marge and Homer. I never understood why she put up with him. It would be cool if he was just the loveable idiot, but he's kind of  a drunken jerkwad who abuses his children, and she is such a sweet heart who gives everything to her family. Makes no sense to me whatsoever!"
295,"He doesn't need to redeem himself. As Elizabeth herself says, ""In essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was.... When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.""

Jane Austen did something remarkable in *Pride and Prejudice*: she only lets us see Darcy through the eyes of Elizabeth. So when Elizabeth overhears a conversation, her first impression is fixed --- and so is ours! We aren't allowed to see how wrong she is until the end of the book. That's why the original title of the novel was ""First Impressions,"" and why the final title includes the word ""Prejudice.""

Despite his clear intelligence, Darcy is incredibly socially awkward and doesn't know how to converse easily with a stranger, especially with a woman he's attracted to. He's also so wealthy that the only women he knows are along the lines of Mrs. Bennet or Caroline Bingley -- vapid fawning mothers and heiresses who want him for his money.

Darcy grows immensely over the course of the book, but that growth is a matter of knowledge (awareness of how he comes across to others) rather than character (rethinking what he values and what moves him to action)."
296,I took my friend to get an abortion in a not so great part of town. The doctors wouldn't even let me hold her hand throughout the entire procedure. And then they showed her the fetus afterwards and she couldn't even tell me what happened because she was crying so hard.

302,"Well, she could (presumably) read and sign the contract...."
303,Ugh. There was nothing appealing about him *or* her.
304,Your doctor is either incredibly ignorant or just blatantly lying to you. What the fuck.
305,"Not OP but: yes, I was scared when I realized how compatible my SO and I are. Because if I screw it up, then I'm losing out on something really, really wonderful, maybe meant to be. AND because you're like, ""Shit, the rest of my life might be starting. This might be it."""
306,"True consideration or thought behind actions or words, rather than using social scripts or doing what society expects blindly/without thought."
307,"Ugh, that is awful. I've had somewhat similar stuff happen in the US, honestly. I'll give my credit card to the server and despite the fact that I handed it to them and they could see a female name on the card, they'd hand the check back to my boyfriend.

Or like last week when my boyfriend and I took my truck's battery into a shop to test it (I was having trouble starting the truck), and even though it was my battery the guy would only talk to my boyfriend about it."
308,I'm doing my best :D
309,"Yes, but if he bugs me I'll say goodbye. "
310,I feel like most people can't conceptualize what a healthy weight is for a body size that isn't their height.
311,My boobs now are fine. What I want is for bra manufacturers to make more bras in my size.
312,"My ex asked me a couple times. 

He was cheating on me. He was drunk at a NYE party and pissed that I was trying to leave. It was used as a last-ditch effort to keep me in his life. He never gave a damn about me, nor did he actually want to build a solid life together. He just wanted to keep me around like a security blanket.

The first time I told him no, he acted like he was hurt over it. But that was him realizing that he can't have everything he wants, not because he actually cared. Because if you care about someone, you don't cheat on them while they're in the next room.  The second and third times, he acted like he expected me to refuse.  

Of course I told him, and everyone else who asked, why I wouldn't marry someone incapable of honesty."

318,"I went to my gp for my depression/anxiety after years of trying to struggle through it. I sobbed my heart out and told him all my symptoms. 

He asked if I had a job, I said yes. He said if I had a job I was going to then I can't be depressed. He then rubbed his thumb across my forehead (big no no) and said I was sweating and it was the heat, not anxiety. He then asked if I loved my partner, I said yes. He asked if I wanted to have babies with him, I said no (a life choice I have made) and he said that I couldn't possibly love my partner if I didn't want to have babies. He told me to go have a baby and it would all be better, I was just sad because I'm a girl.

That's the first time I seriously considered downing a bottle of pills or taking up drinking. "
319,"He treated her like absolute shit and when I was younger I thought it was soooooo romantic they ended up together and that their chemistry was so special. Now I just see he was a commitment phobe emotionally unavailable douchebag who she waited around for and pined for unnecessarily. Very eyeopening tbh.

322,"Have you seen the King's Speech. I don't know how you feel about historical movies but this is about Prince Albert's rise as the King of England as George VI. The only romance in the story is him with his wife as a supporter, and his brothers lover, but nothing excessive

323,"Omg there's more of us! I'm always talking about anal when I'm drunk... It's a wonder I have any friends. Well, I do, I just made sure they're all into anal."
324,"A break implies that she wanted to get back together.  If he wanted to get back he shouldn't have dove head first into someone else's bed. 


Ross is a whiney man child who only banged someone else for revenge. Regardless if he felt justified or not, that's a crappy thing to do. He slept with someone else for his own vindictive pleasure, and only regretted it when he found out Rachel wanted him back. 


Then he was running around town trying to hide it from her, so he knew he messed up. And was deplorable. 

He acted without talking to her, judged based on his own blind jealousy, and burned the remains of that relationship to the ground, then had the audacity to act like he was the injured party. 

His behavior causing the break was also abhorrent. He was the worst sort of boyfriend. Complaining about her job? How she wasn't giving him enough attention? The constant jealousy? How unprofessional he was at her work? Huge turn offs. 

Team Rachel all the way. 

"
325,"To be fair, thinking someone is doing great because of how they present themselves on FB is not an accurate picture. "
326,"My 15 year old self would have been so furious with you, and probably been able to recite direct quotes from the books on how you are misguided and the Ron/Hermione ship is perfection.

To be fair, they didn't make each other miserable for the last three books. Most of the time they are just normal close friends, with the occasional hint that *they fancy each other oooh* in a nice gradual buildup culminating in DH. Especially in OotP, there was no conflict between them at all. In HBP we have teenage drama cause they are too dumb to realise why they're jealous of each other, and in DH there's actual serious drama, but neither of these falling outs actually last very long. They also serve as ways for them to hesitantly move their relationship further, and developing as characters.

We also have to remember that it's all told from Harry's point of view, and he's clearly rather uninterested in whether his mates fancy each other as long as it doesn't interfere with their group dynamic (and clueless enough to not realise this until halfway through HBP). We never actually get a firsthand account of their relationship, only snippets. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione are spending most of their summers together and hanging out without Harry around as much as they do with him. 

I really like Harry and Hermione as just friends, there's a lot of love and trust but to me there was never a hint of any romantic or sexual tension. Having them get together would have just felt a bit weird. Besides, I feel like there is a lack of portrayals of really strong friendships between a man and woman where romance never comes into it ever. But back in the day, before we found out how it all ended, the Harry/Hermione ship was just as popular as Ron/Hermione. I remember the internet fandom outrage when Rowling actually confirmed which way it was going to be haha. So I doubt you're alone."
327,"I am overly sensitive, an active apologizer, and an over thank-er.

In my personal goal to make everyone I know a happier, healthier human, it helps a lot. It helps make my loved ones feel comfortable and appreciated.

329,"I'm from the U.S., but my biggest culture shock happened right here in New York City when I attended an orthodox Jewish wedding.

I've never felt more like a second-class citizen. The reception room was divided in half by a portable curtain that was about 7 feet tall. One side for men, and the other for women. Of course men were allowed to come over to the women's side as they pleased, but women were forbidden to go to the men's side. 

The men were served their dinner first, and the women were served from what was left when they were done eating. Not literally the scraps off their plates, but whatever food had been cooked and untouched. The men might have had alcohol too, because my dad definitely got drunk. There also might have been a band, but I couldn't really tell because the music was coming from the men's side. 

The men looked like they were having tons of fun hoisting the groom onto chairs (I could at least see that happening over the 7 foot curtain), yelling, laughing, all the usual wedding stuff. For the most part, the women just sat on our side and quietly chatted with each other until the men were ready to leave.

My dad recalls this as one of the best weddings ever, and I distinctly recall it as the worst. 

Disclaimer: this is the only orthodox Jewish wedding I've ever been to, so I'm not claiming that this is typical for Orthodox Jews. I have no clue what's typical."

338,"I've taken public transportation my whole life and I've seen the number of people using wheel chairs increase a lot. It's people that I've watched just grow more and more obese and now a lot have trouble walking so they use scooters and wheel chairs. Because of this, the busses are almost never on time because of how often they need to pick someone up in a wheelchair. It can take several minutes to get someone on the bus and buckled in. 

What's sad is that because these people didn't take care of themselves or didn't have the recourses to I've watched people with legs missing or who are paralyzed have to wait for another bus because the spots are taken up by these people. Who weirdly travel in pairs. 

The busses can't even accommodate to the size of these wheel chairs most of the time. I don't even know what you would do about that. 

I feel bad for getting annoyed because these are people who are poor and usually have some kind of mental disability.

Our first date I honestly wasn't really interested because from the first impression he seems like one of those self centered arrogant people.

Also, I don't need diet advice. Do you think I got to be 37 years old and it just never occurred to me that eating less might help?  I've probably lost 450 pounds or more in my lifetime. It's just that they're really the same 30 to 50 pounds over and over again. I know how to lose weight. What I struggle with is the constant all-encompassing hunger I experience afterwards that leads me to put it back on. "

I took wayyy too much LSD (7 tabs dosed 100-150) and we went to a public park on a beautiful summer day so the park was full of people and I became convinced everyone was there as an elaborate setup for him to propose to me. We had been dating about 4 months. I began ecstatically yelling ""YES!"" I started having an allergy attack so he asked a nice woman for a tissue and I thought the ring must be hidden in the tissue so I ripped it up but couldn't find the ring so I thought I must've dropped it and started hysterically crying. He had to drag me out of the park because everyone was staring. Then I told him I was pregnant. Poor guy was on acid too (much less than me) and justifiably freaked out.

This was almost 3 years ago.

He moved across the country to work for a very large, well-known company (probably making a ton of money) and is now engaged to someone I can assume is a great person. I am in the same suburban area with admittedly a great and high-paying career, but I have a string of failed, dead-end relationships behind me. I look better than I did when we broke up, but that doesn't mean much to me when i don't have much to show for it.

I don't regret breaking up with him, as I still don't think we were destined to get married. But I very much regret taking for granted what a great man he was. I haven't seen him perse, but visiting his facebook is always bittersweet. "

373,"I have a mom one too! Well, stepmom but I consider her a mom.

My dad asked her twice. I don't know know the intricacies of their communication about it beforehand but she turned him down because she wanted to be absolutely positive she was ready to have two children (one with special needs) &amp; an insane ex-wife in her life *forever*. She didn't think it'd be fair to my sibling or I, our dad, or herself, to say yes unless she was completely certain. ""It'll all work out eventually"" was not good enough to get married. She made good &amp; sure that she was ready &amp; I'm so thankful for her."

375,"It seems many people pay little mind to being financially stable before having kids. Note: I get that accidents happen, so I'm referring to people who knowingly and intentionally procreate before they're in a position to do so.

I understand the cost of raising a kid is exorbitant, and I don't think procreating should be limited to the rich... But I also think a lot of parents are overly idealistic and adopt the false mentality that ""well, there's no good time to have a child--but hey, we'll be okay because we have love."" Ergo, lots of parents struggling to make ends meet, living on credit cards/paycheck to paycheck, being unable to pay for childcare, etc.

It also seems taboo to mention that, in regard to mental disorders, there's often a genetic component and kids with mentally ill parents may be predisposed to bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, etc. In general, I think these parents are giving their children a disadvantage from the very beginning. Just strikes me as very sad and selfish."

377,"/u/peanutsbeta wrote the best analysis of this stupid argument I've ever seen:

I can't stand Ross or Rachel. They're awful, manipulative, petty, shallow human beings.

Rachel, unless she is the most colossally clueless girlfriend in history, understands that Ross is uncomfortable with her friendship with Mark. It likely stems from jealousy, since Ross is a remarkably insecure man. But it's also exacerbated by Ross having lost his wife to another person. She is incredibly insensitive to flaunt her friendship when her boyfriend is so uncomfortable with it (especially because Ross is aware that Mark wants a relationship with Rachel). 

Ross is completely unable to voice his concerns to Rachel in an adult manner. Instead, he relies on snarky remarks and passive aggression. He never gives her a chance to assuage his concerns about Mark, and exhibits a stunning lack of trust in his girlfriend. Even if he's recently been left by his wife for another person, he's enough of an adult to realize that Rachel is not his ex-wife.

It is absolutely understandable that, given Rachel's inflection, tone, and penchant for sarcasm, Ross would understand her comment about taking a break to mean that they are broken up. I'd even argue that, based on how Rachel acted the next day, even she thought that ""taking a break"" means they are broken up. Given the emotion in the situation, I even understand them not having a conversation to clarify what ""on a break"" means.

Ross is, as I've mentioned, infuriatingly insecure, and amazingly childish. When he, in a rare moment of grown-uppededness, called Rachel to talk things out he heard Mark's voice, immediately assumed the worst and dissolved into a puddle of lukewarm self pity. Then he does what any insecure, shallow, and (most importantly) absolutely hammered person would do, and sleeps with the first person who gives him any positive regard. He drowns his sorrows, so to speak.

Rachel, having her own not-as-fleeting-but-still-irritatingly-brief moment of being a reasonable, level headed actual person and not a demon, reconsiders, rebuffs Mark, and goes to reconcile with Ross. Ross, having sobered up, is horrified to learn that he has slept with another woman, and attempts to see her out, only for Rachel to show up.

To this point, I mostly understand why everyone involved acts as they do. But here's where it goes all sitcom-y. Instead of the two of them realizing that they need to communicate, both ask forgiveness from and forgive one another, and work on their relationship, they make things worse.

Ross attempts to hide what he's done. Which backfires. And Rachel in her usual shrill, selfish manner attacks Ross.

From there, Ross creepily refuses to acknowledge Rachel's wishes. Rachel waffles on how she feels about Ross, not wanting to date him without constantly reminding him of what he already knows is the stupidest thing he's ever done, but also not wanting him to date anyone else. They go back and forth and ultimately wind up together.

Rachel is right. Ross did a horrible, insensitive thing. Ross is right. They were broken up at the time. Ross is wrong. He refused to acknowledge Rachel's feelings and let her grieve for the relationship. Rachel is wrong. She passively aggressively tortured Ross (and his girlfriends/fiancée) and expressed her interest in Ross only when he was with someone else.

Tl;Dr - They're both right, and they're both wrong. They're horrific excuses for people. And they deserve each other. And I can't think of a worse insult than that.

378,"I was 26. We had been together half our lives. We were each other's first everything. Everyone kept asking when we would set a date, as if on the outside we were the perfect couple. 
We grew apart though. Familiarity bred contempt. He became very controlling and insecure. He became obese, smoked , binge drank and his sex drive tanked. He lied about some consumer debt he racked up and I had to bail him out. 
By the time he proposed, it was during one of many fights, as if it was a plea for us to stay together. My answer was firmly no. We finally parted ways and are happier now."
379,can i get his number
