Don't quite understand what that one's about.."
1,"Oh you misspelled ""heelys"" "
2,"The best advice I've ever heard on this situation is just to distract the guy, by asking him if the bus just passed, or whether the shop down the road is open, whatever. It's less risky for the guy stepping in, but gives the woman a chance to get out of there. "
3,"When he moved from his town to my town in his new house, we had a celebratory supper of pizza and champagne in Dixie cups after unpacking all his stuff from the uhaul. 

When I went to grab a Dixie cup from the stack to pour some in, the cup had ""Move in?"" written on it. I think my jaw immediately dropped and I got goosebumps. 

*Turns out he wrote it on all the cups because he wasn't sure which one I would take!"

5,When a person who normally isn't very smooth or flirtatious winks at you. Especially if it's done after they've said something or made a joke to someone else.

You DO NOT have a ""really good metabolism"". "
8,"I don't think this really answers your question but, it irks me to no end when I am watching a movie and they show a Black woman going to bed with no scarf on her head... -_-

Something that answers your question better. I hate when people re-write classic movies just to replace white people with POC. Like, no that's not what we want. We want to write our OWN stories that are true to us. And to create new characters. The point is not to replace white people on TV. The point is that there is more than enough room for different races/religions/etc to be represented on TV."
9,"Seeing a man's forearms flex a bit so the muscles in them are defined and visible.

Even better if those arms are wrapped around me from behind and I'm looking down at his forearms."
10,I was angry at my boyfriend on my way home from work so I bought a snack just for me and ate it in the car so I wouldn't have to share or get him one. 
11,"Honestly sometimes I worry that my husband doesn't stack up to the expectation of what makes someone an incredible spouse. He's kind of clumsy when trying to take care of me because no one ever taught him how to be nurturing. He's loud and a little too rough with our dog because he never learned how to be gentle. He gets too angry over video games and when he's upset his language center shuts down and he can't tell me if he's hungry or sad or frustrated because his whole life people told him he wasn't allowed to have feelings, let alone express them. So he messes up sometimes and says hurtful things and I doubt I'll ever have the kind of husband that would show his love for me by fixing my dead father's watch or hand feeding me his grandmother's chicken soup or by writing me a poem about my eyes.  


But I did marry the guy that told me it was okay that I had scars from self harm and that it was okay that I didn't want to have sex and that it was okay that I had a panic attack and that it was okay that I am too scared to drive on the highway until I stubbornly decide I need to prove to myself that I can and then that's okay too.


So to answer your question, the nicest thing an SO has ever done for me is say ""that's okay"".   


Edit: thank you all for your heartfelt comments and for sharing similar stories, and especially thank you to the very kind person who gilded this comment.

12,"I was on my way to his, but we'd just had an argument over the phone and it was kind of my fault. So, I decided to buy us dinner and stormed into a thai takeaway and angrily ordered our favourites but I ordered his black bean   curry extra spicy because he can't handle too much spice. 

To cut a long story short, I felt absolutely awful and couldn't tell him so I gave him my order and swallowed his extra spicy his order instead. He asked why I was crying over my meal and I told him I felt terrible for arguing over the phone, it was only half a lie. "
13,"I got stranded in the US during a snowstorm and was stuck for 3 days. Absolute travel chaos. My SO picked my dog up from the boarder (so I wouldn't be stuck paying even more fees) and took care of him for that time, then drove across town to shovel out my parking spot and tidied up my apartment so I could just collapse when I got back. After an incredibly stressful trip we weren't even in touch for most of, I got home to everything just *handled* and it made me melt. "
14,"It is like being a teenager again, except instead of trying to find a place where my parents won't catch me, I'm trying to hide from my children.  "
15,Have intense and draining anxiety if you're not on time.  Allow your feelings of discomfort and fear overwhelm you and rule your life.
16,The number of languages I can speak
17,"Showed up at my house late one night while I was deathly ill with an arm load of groceries and a fuzzy blanket. Banished me to the couch while he made me soup and tidied my apartment. 

I cried. I'm used to being on my own, and having someone take care of me was a very new experience. 


- The time he fed me tea and nausea meds and made his apartment chilly so I could be a little more comfortable while my migraine medicine kicked in. 


- Or the time he sat with me in court for a domestic violence hearing against my ex. He held my hand the entire time, then bought me the best breakfast you can find in this city.

18,"Glorifying things associated with men, while degrading things associated with women. Example: Bacon = manly and good, but pumpkin spice lattes = girly and ""basic."" I don't see why these things are even associated with gender at all in the first place, let alone why those associated with men should be considered superior. "
19,"When you compare hands with someone and they just have *big* hands üòç did it last night on a date and he was like wow you're so small, and proceeded to see if he could fit his fingers around my wrist. Swoon."
20,"I'm not a big fan of throwing the token ""ethnic"" person into the show who is super 2D. And worse, when they try to show either exaggerated versions of them in either direction  (either they're the super stereotypical version of that ethnicity or they're the polar opposite like so unbelievably ""white"" it's too much).

21,"I don't know if this counts, but about 12 years ago, I was looking up cheat codes for Sonic 3 online, and one of them was called ""Make Sonic Have A Really Big Afro,"" and it was literally just to stand next to the goal sign in the right position to make Sonic's head look giant."
22,"hip V also know as penis shoulders

23,"My husband wears sweats and basketball shorts as his around the house clothes all the time.

24,"If any of you are familiar with Cheryl Strayed, author of *Wild*, she used to have an anonymous column on the Rumpus. This is one of her most beautiful letters.

Dear Sugar,

I read your column religiously. I‚Äôm 22. From what I can tell by your writing, you‚Äôre in your early 40s. My question is short and sweet: what would you tell your 20-something self if you could talk to her now?

Love,
Seeking Wisdom


Dear Seeking Wisdom,

Stop worrying about whether you‚Äôre fat. You‚Äôre not fat. Or rather, you‚Äôre sometimes a little bit fat, but who gives a shit? There is nothing more boring and fruitless than a woman lamenting the fact that her stomach is round. Feed yourself. Literally. The sort of people worthy of your love will love you more for this, sweet pea.

In the middle of the night in the middle of your twenties when your best woman friend crawls naked into your bed, straddles you, and says, You should run away from me before I devour you, believe her.

You are not a terrible person for wanting to break up with someone you love. You don‚Äôt need a reason to leave. Wanting to leave is enough. Leaving doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre incapable of real love or that you‚Äôll never love anyone else again. It doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre morally bankrupt or psychologically demented or a nymphomaniac. It means you wish to change the terms of one particular relationship. That‚Äôs all. Be brave enough to break your own heart.

When that really sweet but fucked up gay couple invites you over to their cool apartment to do ecstasy with them, say no.

There are some things you can‚Äôt understand yet. Your life will be a great and continuous unfolding. It‚Äôs good you‚Äôve worked hard to resolve childhood issues while in your twenties, but understand that what you resolve will need to be resolved again. And again. You will come to know things that can only be known with the wisdom of age and the grace of years. Most of those things will have to do with forgiveness.

One evening you will be rolling around on the wooden floor of your apartment with a man who will tell you he doesn‚Äôt have a condom. You will smile in this spunky way that you think is hot and tell him to fuck you anyway. This will be a mistake for which you alone will pay.

Don‚Äôt lament so much about how your career is going to turn out. You don‚Äôt have a career. You have a life. Do the work. Keep the faith. Be true blue. You are a writer because you write. Keep writing and quit your bitching. Your book has a birthday. You don‚Äôt know what it is yet.

You cannot convince people to love you. This is an absolute rule. No one will ever give you love because you want him or her to give it. Real love moves freely in both directions. Don‚Äôt waste your time on anything else.

Most things will be okay eventually, but not everything will be. Sometimes you‚Äôll put up a good fight and lose. Sometimes you‚Äôll hold on really hard and realize there is no choice but to let go. Acceptance is a small, quiet room.

One hot afternoon during the era in which you‚Äôve gotten yourself ridiculously tangled up with heroin you will be riding the bus and thinking what a worthless piece of crap you are when a little girl will get on the bus holding the strings of two purple balloons. She‚Äôll offer you one of the balloons, but you won‚Äôt take it because you believe you no longer have a right to such tiny beautiful things. You‚Äôre wrong. You do.

Your assumptions about the lives of others are in direct relation to your na√Øve pomposity. Many people you believe to be rich are not rich. Many people you think have it easy worked hard for what they got. Many people who seem to be gliding right along have suffered and are suffering. Many people who appear to you to be old and stupidly saddled down with kids and cars and houses were once every bit as hip and pompous as you.

When you meet a man in the doorway of a Mexican restaurant who later kisses you while explaining that this kiss doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúmean anything‚Äù because, much as he likes you, he is not interested in having a relationship with you or anyone right now, just laugh and kiss him back. Your daughter will have his sense of humor. Your son will have his eyes.

The useless days will add up to something. The shitty waitressing jobs. The hours writing in your journal. The long meandering walks. The hours reading poetry and story collections and novels and dead people‚Äôs diaries and wondering about sex and God and whether you should shave under your arms or not. These things are your becoming.

One Christmas at the very beginning of your twenties when your mother gives you a warm coat that she saved for months to buy, don‚Äôt look at her skeptically after she tells you she thought the coat was perfect for you. Don‚Äôt hold it up and say it‚Äôs longer than you like your coats to be and too puffy and possibly even too warm. Your mother will be dead by spring. That coat will be the last gift she gave you. You will regret the small thing you didn‚Äôt say for the rest of your life.

Say thank you.

26,"[Use a reusable CD-R/W case to store bagels on the go!](http://imgur.com/a/pUVsg)  

Because 

 A) I wanna keep my old CD-R/W cases around for bagel transport purposes 

and 

 B) What is wrong with a sandwich bag or a piece of tupperware?  

Am I so obsessed with filling a void in my life that I have to fill the hole of my bagel when stored, too?  What if my bagel has ham, or cheese, or any addition that doesn't give way to a stupid CD spindle?  Why should my sandwich conform to such an archaic and outdated mode of transport for CD's, much less sandwiches?

These, are the LPT's I do not need or want.  
"
27,Surreptitiously taken photos posted on the internet and meant to shame people. Mind your own business and don't be an asshole. 
28,"Depends on their relationship now, if he lets me meet her, if he's weird or secretive about it, and just the general vibe of the situation. "
29,"&gt; *Turns out he wrote it on all the cups because he wasn't sure which one I would take!

D'aw. This makes the story so much sweeter. "
30,I like watching him tie a tie. Cause he knows how. And it's my favorite thing. 
31,"We have to lock doors. 

Also we tend to only have sex when it's late at night or early morning when the kids are in their beds or down stairs watching cartoons. It's a mood killer having some great sex when you get a knock on your bedroom door from your kid asking for something to eat/tell on their sibling etc. It's easier now that they're older. 

We tend to do it in the shower a lot more though which for the husband is a bonus. For me, ehh. 

We haven't had a day in bed having sex in...I can't even remember. I miss that. A lot. My parents are moving to my town in a few months and I cannot wait for some husband and wife time while the kids are with nanny!! 

We've been together something like 15 years and our sex life is still awesome kids or no kids. 

"
32,"I'll always be grateful for a stranger that helped me in this situation. I was young, like 18 I think, taking the subway. He was probably mentally ill but my default is still ""be polite, be quiet, hope he goes away."" He was saying sexual things to me in English and swearing at me in French (Montreal) as I stood on the platform trying to ignore him. Train arrives, and even through he'd been several meters away he moves to get on the same car as me. I sit in a half empty car, he proceeds to sit next to me and continues harassing me. I try to change seats a few times, he follows each time. Finally a friendly guy offers me the seat by the window, and sits next to me to block my harasser, who tries to talk over him nonetheless. Friendly guy then starts talking to harasser, and gently takes him by the elbow to another set of seats. At the next stop I get up to hurry off and when harasser tries to follow, friendly guy gently says ""She doesn't want to talk to you"" and blocks his way, trying to distract him with conversation.

It's been over ten years and I'll always appreciate friendly guy's smooth reaction. "

35,Sweatshirts tied around the waist in middle/high school. Sooooo many accidents with heavy periods were safely hidden!
36,"I personally don't like that really uncomfortable white savior story line that they use in feel good movies. Like...the whole school was failing and all it took was one (usually white female) teacher to see the good in that inner city thug classroom to turn it around and get them into Harvard?

Why is that acceptable? It's annoying, overdone, and insulting. "
37,"As someone who was homeless for a few years I'll try to help out here. First and foremost: WATER. A reusable water bottle (I like the collapsible kind like the Platypus), some of those water cleaning tabs maybe, or just a damn jug of clean water.

Small soaps, soap is heavy, but sanitizer doesn't do a great job. Wipes are alright too. *I really like the tiny bottles of doctor bronners, you can use it on everything.

Long lasting, lightweight food. Think dried goods; dried fruit, granola, nuts, jerky.

Since it's winter I'd also say those little hand warming packets and some serious socks would be good. Also maybe a poncho.

Bandaids, toilet paper and Aquaphor/Vaseline are also good. The Aquaphor works as lotion, lip balm and salve for wounds, it's pretty great.

We have clothes, we can get clothes easily, don't waste your time on clothes, please.

I'm sure I could go on and on, feel free to ask me. I was homeless for about 2.5 years in the Chicago suburbs (read: really fucking cold) edit: adding a few little things, taking out one apparently dangerous mistake. "

Also, when he hugs me before he goes to work every day, he always hugs me like it's the last time he will ever wrap his arms around me. I can literally feel how much he loves me. 

Everything he does turns me on in some way. I have never been so in love with someone. It's ridiculous."

44,"They're not worth the calories to me if they aren't intoxicating. I mostly drink water when I'm not drinking alcohol. And the only alcohol I drink these days are IPAs, vodka, and alcoholic ginger ale. I like the taste of IPAs and ginger ale, but I probably still wouldn't drink them if they weren't alcoholic (and I know I already don't drink non-alcoholic ginger ale even though it's readily available)."
45,"My last manic phase:

I started going on mega shopping sprees. I spent $12000 on a necklace, and two weeks later I lost it at the beach and didn't even blink. I just went ""oh well, easy come easy go"". But it wasn't, because I'd signed up for a new credit card and maxed it out buying that necklace. I couldn't even tell you now what it looked like or which bank the credit card belonged to.

I spent hours wandering around the supermarket, trying to find the perfect onions and potatoes and then I left with nothing because nothing came up to standard. I drove insanely recklessly, I started parting really hard. I drove 15 hours across the state to go to a party and drove home straight after.

I started repainting my house, a mural in every room. Then I stopped and decided to paint the fences instead, stopped halfway through and built a chook run.

Then I began feeling like someone was following me. Then I could see them, always moving out of my vision when I turned to look. So I started double and triple checking all the locks in my house. Then I stopped going out, because I could hear this person calling my name across crowded rooms.

I'd wake up in the middle of the night and smell smoke, then have to search every nook and cranny thinking there was a fire somewhere in my house. I'd wake up thinking I was having a heart attack because my heart was racing so much. I couldn't focus on anything, every time I looked at something it moved.

I started cutting, because it was the only thing that seemed to slow my heart rate down and make me actually able to focus.

She printed off my posts and showed them to everyone that we know. It was horrible. In the end, I decided not to start a new account. If she wanted me to tell nicer stories about her, she should have treated me better. "

51,"When he takes his sweater off and his shirt gets stuck to the sweater, so both pull up for a few seconds. Omf it's no wonder we have a baby crawling around. "
52,"It's happened a few times but I really appreciate when he is so patient with me when I'm clearly upset over something. As a child, I hid away and cried and never let people know my real feelings. I often cried myself to sleep. I was convinced if I told anyone they wouldn't care, I'd just be burdening them, it was a waste of everyone's time etc. I think I became that way because the few times I opened up to my mum (my only parental figure) she would make it all about herself. So I gave up telling anyone at all. Clearly not the healthiest coping mechanism.

But with my SO, he recognised when that was happening with me. I'd be upset and he wouldn't accept 'I'm fine, it's silly, it's nothing...' as an answer and kept saying that if it upset me then it clearly did matter. He would sit with me in silence, just holding me, letting me know he was ready for me and would listen to me and cared for me. He wouldn't try to fix the problems, he'd just...hold me. Really tight. And he'd check I was okay before he let go, and even when I'd try to fool him and say I was fine now, he'd double check and look into my eyes so I couldn't lie convincingly.

I guess what astounded me though is the lengths he'll go to stay with me when I'm feeling that way. It doesn't matter what time it is. How inconvenient it might be. Doesn't matter if it's 3am and he has to be up early for work or if it's 6pm and he's starving. He puts me first. And that's how I know how much he cares."
53,"My first HS boyfriend: He was a little controlling about image and spent an hour telling me that he thought my makeup was boring. He wanted me to wear more colors.  The next day, I decided to show him!  I went into my makeup collection and turned my face into a rainbow of color.  Multiple bright and contrasting shades of eyeshadow (extending out to my temples), teal mascara, bright blush, 2 shades of lipstick.  He looked quite shocked when he showed up for our date.  He also never tried to tell me how to wear my makeup again.

My husband: Sometimes, when I'm really annoyed with him, I will watch and delete things off the DVR that he has said he wants to watch.  Not his favorite shows, just random movies or something that have been on there for a while.  He usually doesn't even notice, but I know."
54,"I wish I'd understood the colossal amounts of change I'd experience. I'm almost 28 and I'm not *remotely* the same person I was at 20. I don't want any of the same things, a lot of my worldview has shifted, my social circle has changed drastically. I'm more confident, I have way more money, I feel like I have a direction and control over my life, and the future doesn't freak me out nearly as much. 

Your twenties aren't when you get ""old."" Your twenties are when you do a lot of growing up (which is not the same as becoming all serious and not having fun -- I have tons of fun and plan to continue). And it's been a little scary but mostly exciting so far. 

Also, yes, sunscreen. And try not to dig yourself into any financial holes.  "

59,The ice soap life hack that recommended freezing liquid soap in a block of ice and washing yourself with it. I think I cried laughing so hard the first time I read the comments on that thread. 
60,"Remember that the girl being harassed will probably also be suspicious of you, so don't do anything like encourage her to come with you to get away from the harasser, or try to hug her to comfort her, etc. Even if you're a good guy, she doesn't know that, and unfortunately there are dudes out there who think by 'saving' a 'damsel in distress' they're then free to make a move on her themselves. So bear in mind that in a situation like this, she's gonna be suspicious and a little panicked, so don't rely on her trusting you. If you're with a female friend / girlfriend things are a little different, as she'll probably feel more comfortable around another woman. 

Also, don't make her feel embarrassed or patronised. For example, by saying to the harasser, 'look how terrified you're making her!'. Don't speak for her, or draw attention to her vulnerability. When being harassed by a stranger in public, the last thing you want is even more eyes on you. Plus it's just embarrassing, and just drives home the point that she's unable to defend herself. 

De-escalate the situation. Don't start a physical fight or something like that, 1. because violence is bad, 2. because she's gonna feel way responsible if someone gets hurt defending her, and 3. she's just gonna want things over as soon as possible. 

So basically, the best thing to do is to draw attention away from her, without escalating the situation. "
61,"Well, last summer I was on a date with one girl. We were on a bench talking drinking beers when another one sat close by.  she started to enter the conversation. 

Which was odd. But hey, i never back down from a conversation. She told us there was a weird guy following her so we reseated to make it a 3 person group. I didnt know what to do so I gave her the last remaining beer. 

She usually waits there for her bf but he was running late and she was still freaked out from before. She was very happy with the beer. Later the creepy dude found her/us sitting there. 

We reseated. I sat next to her. My date across from us. And we ignored him. I did pay attention to the guy and noticed he was mostly mentally not all there. So I couldn't get in a conversation with him and distract him. 
Soon the bf walked up. Surprised by the two strangers with his gf. luckily they are made for each other and with a few words we all went on our well planned double date. 

The date and I didn't work out. But we all remained friends.

So I say beer and conversation is a solution sometimes. "
62,"I have three sons.  

At the age of 8, they had to start changing their own sheets.

At the age of 10, they had to do dishes every night, and vacuum, dust and bathrooms once a week. 

At the age of 14, they had to start making one meal a week.

At the age of 16, they had to do their own laundry and help with grocery shopping.

I remember someone visiting us gasping when the boys started to clear the table and do dishes.  ""How do you get them to do that?"" they marveled.

""We live here,"" the youngest responded.

They're good boys."
63,"This is really minor compared to other comments, but I was in a LDR and felt like I was doing all of the emotional work in the relationship. We usually talked on the phone every night, if only for a few minutes, but I was always the one to coordinate this. One day I just didn't call or text and decided to wait to see how long it would take for him to reach out to me... it took a week. When he did finally call he was surprised I was upset with him.

I definitely could have handled that situation better, as I essentially set up a trap for him, but it was very revealing and the relationship ended shortly after."

When I get the hiccups they last forever and are really loud unless I keep my mouth closed. Rather than running to the kitchen to get a glass of water to cure them, I just sat there hiccuping my butt off with the sole purpose of annoying my bf. I kept my mouth open the entire time so my boyfriend couldnt really even hear the tv, just my nonstop squeaking. After about 20 minutes of this I could feel the tension in the air and I could tell my bf was getting pissed ""but baby, I cant help it!"". So i went to the kitchen pretending I was getting a glass of water for my hiccups. Instead I chugged some soda, making the hiccups even worse. After another 20 minutes they went away and my petty revenge was over.     "

74,"6 months into the relationship, I was really upset because I missed my sister who was away for school. Neither of us could afford the plane ticket. He surprised me and got her fly here. I was living with roommates back then and didn't have any room for my sister. He insisted us to stay at his studio, he went to his friend's house for the week. I love that man so much."
75,"This is so so true that even as a white girl it annoys me. Master of None's ""Indians on TV"" episode was one of my favorites. It brings light to everything this post is about. I miss that show."
76,Jenson Ackles. That man is a genetic freak. 
77,"Years and years ago we were fighting and I knew he'd worry about me so I opened the door and made it sound like I left, then hid in the house. He went outside looking for me like I knew he would, and I reclaimed the bedroom. 



He was not amused as he was certain I'd been abducted "
78,"Well, it's been a bit more awkward since this past weekend when my 11 year old, whose chore it is to pick up the dog poo from the back yard, found one of our condoms sticking half way out of a turd. ""You should probably dispose of those better."" he said with a straight face. "

86,"I find that some men tend to ignore the whole ""ranting makes you feel better"" thing when it doesn't apply to them. They rant about their problems and I listen, throwing in an occasional ""Wow, that sucks!"" or ""Jeez, that dude's an idiot!"" but when I have a problem that I need to rant about, they go on and on about how I can solve the problem. Dude. I'm an adult. I can solve my own problems. What I need is for you to listen to me rant, like I do you, and agree. Don't try to treat me like I'm a child who can't handle difficulties and problems. 

Makes them seem selfish and like they're sitting on some high horse with their (imagined) patience."
87,"Dated a guy for about 9 months. He made a big deal about introducing me to his family, told me he loved me, the whole deal. One day he called me on the phone and said he wanted to break up. That he never loved me after all. That he had lied every time he had said it. That he did it on purpose, and that he had used me to get over a girl he was crazy about. He told me that he wasn't attracted to me and gave me a very specific reason (read:  physical flaw) as reasoning why. Then he hung up. 

That fucked me up. In the moment I asked him how and why he could do something like this. How did it start? And he responded ""it just started out as usage"". Usage. Usage is something you do to a shampoo bottle or milk carton, not a person. 

How did I move on? It was hard, not because of missing him or mourning the relationship, because it was clear after that that he was basically satan. The hard part was not letting his words get to me. I had to fight every day not to believe that he was right and that I really was not good enough. The hard part was looking in the mirror and fighting back that voice that tells me that I'm less-than. Humiliation like that doesn't wash off in the shower the next day. It seeps into your skin and gets down deep and it has to be *worn* off. Over time. Somehow I made it."

109,"I'm half East Asian, and I remember how much the character Glen from the Walking Dead stood out to me the first few seasons of the show. Yeah, he's very clearly East Asian, but like that's it. He's also shown as sexually attractive (and gets the hot girl), important to the group, a hero without being some sort of ninja, and has a skill set that has nothing to do with math or science. I think his race was mentioned like one time (Merle the racist refers to him as 'Chinaman' and Darryl says: ""He's Korean""). And having a racist insult hurled at you isn't an unrealistic experience.

I just remember being shocked at how surprised I was by his character and its development because I realized how rare it was."

My job is slower pace, less pressure, but the environment (government) can be really frustrating. My work problems are not ground breaking compared to his work problems, but they're still *my problems* and sometimes I need to vent about them because they still ruin my day. 

I've expressed my frustration and my need to be listened to without being one-upped and he's working on it.  "

I was new to town and didn't have any help. He frequently chose magic over me. So, when he wasn't looking, I shuffled random stacks of magic cards and put them throughout the collection. I also deleted all the save files from a final fantasy game he had played over 15 hours on and still hadn't beat but was near the end. "
139,We had gotten into a fight and he thought that he would just run off and lock himself in the office with his computer to ignore me. I turned the wifi off and he spent an hour restarting his computer and calling the IT tech line before he realized it was just unplugged. Bwa ha ha.

142,"So I've been severely sick with the flu on and off for about a month now. I don't have health insurance so I've been holding out on going to the ER/walk-in because im broke as shit. But, after a few restless nights this week I finally decided to go and dish out $130 for the visit. Severe Bronchitis/dehydration/sinus infection. Happy I can get better before Christmas. Not so happy part- the medications came out to $200 total. I broke down at the pharmacy because I had literally $60 to my name and I was delirious from driving myself around all day. So I called my SO crying just to vent and boom- he left work, drove 30 minutes out to me, and paid for my medications. Knight in fucking shining armor. Now I won't be sick when I go home for Christmas.



Tl;dr: sick as fuck, broke as fuck. couldn't afford medications, SO paid for them. 

Edit: we've only been seeing each other for about 4 months. I think he's a keeper"
143,"This is pretty much us too. We have two daughters ages 7 and 16. We are a pretty close/open family. My daughters never shut their bedroom door, unless they're changing of course, nor do my husband and I. So, now I feel like anytime I shut and lock the door they must know what we're doing. It's very hard to get in the mood. I agree with you, a lot of late-night sex for us too. We've been together 16 years. You just find ways to get creative. Too bad for my husband though, I hate shower sex.

All that being said, we don't hide affection or the fact that we have a sex life from our children. We obviously don't do anything inappropriate in front of them, but I think it's important for them to know that sex is not a dirty or taboo thing when done responsibly."
144,"The ability to admit they don't know.  One of our first dates with my husband, my car was having trouble.  I asked him if he could look at it.  He said, ""I can open the hood and stare at it and tell you it's an engine, if that's what you mean.  But I haven't a clue what would be wrong with it.""

I've been with SO MANY MEN (dad and brothers included) who feel they have to solve it even if they don't know.  I love a man who can admit they don't.  And then go out and get the learning to know in the future."

Just the other day, I had a cashier make a ""joke"" about how I ""wear the pants"" in the relationship and ""obviously"" have my SO on a short leash just because I was the one paying for our groceries.  

Also, just this weekend, I had a man come up behind me in a thrift store and try to reach under my arm and grope me. 

And that's just this past week in a fairly liberal part of the US."
153,"I guess the second rape. 

I was raped early 2015 (didn't know that's what it was), and was really uneasy about dating. I met someone who was good about my boundaries and encouraged me to open up to him about what I had been through, and we swapped personal details and whatnot over a period of quite a few months. We met up once, but nothing happened and he left quite abruptly. He apologized and we went back to talking. 

Anyway, he did something similar to what the first rapist did, only that time, I ended up getting pregnant, because he didn't use a condom. It came out during that whole awful ordeal that he had lied about everything. His age, where he was from, his mother being dead, his father being in a nursing home, everything that he had told me had been a lie. He apparently just thought I was an easy lay, and acted accordingly. He was repulsed by me, and hated every second of his raping me. 

I'm in therapy now, but I've withdrawn from dating and sex altogether. I'm going to be alone for the rest of my short years (except the cats and dogs), and that's fine with me. I don't trust anyone, and I don't want to go through the process of trying and failing to trust someone again. Im quite content-ish with my lot. "

157,"When discussing a legitimate problem: ""you'll feel better when your period is over."""
158,"I'm East Asian. As much as I'm glad there are shows that are finally giving us a voice (eg. Fresh off the Boat, Kim's Convenience), their portrayals of Asians are limited and even borderline offensive. I'd like to think that we as a society are finally getting past using the played-out ""Tiger mom/dad"", ""emasculated Asian man"" and ""hyper-sexual or submissive Asian woman"" tropes, but with every new TV show or movie release starring Asians, apparently not.

161,Definitely!  As a white girl I had no idea that this was the norm until I got to college and lived in dorms.  I cannot think of a single instance where I saw that portrayed anywhere.
162,"I actually look better at someone if they are friends or at least civil with their exes. To me it shows that they are able to end things in a mature civil manner. Sure everyone may have one or two crazy exes, but if every single one of someone's exes are the devil then it makes me question the one thing they have in common, the SO. "
163,"There's a guy at my climbing gym who I see around and refer to in my head as my boyfriend, e.g. ""Oh look my boyfriend's here."" I'm currently trying to seduce him by walking past him all the time but not making eye contact."
164,"No, but it's how many women are raised to behave. And in a situation like that it's frightening to consider angering the creep into physical rather than just verbal abuse."
165,Material goods exchanged for tearing your perineum.
166,"Overlook in *themselves*? Possibly social grace. I think being able to carry a conversation well, adapt to and recognize body language, moderate their speech and behaviour, and genuinely *enjoy* other people translates into a person others find enjoyable to be around and who can attract people into their life.  
  
Charisma, basically."
167,The whole making fun of people who are just living their lives and not hurting anyone thing.
168,This one sticks out to me because it is so silly and sweet. I had this hamster that I LOVED but he died and I was heartbroken. Everyone who knows me knows I was obsessed with that little fucker. After he died I was pretty depressed and then one day I got an email saying my hamster had been accepted into the hamster astronaut program. He had signed him up for it without telling me so it would be a surprise. It was such a small thing to do but was totally sweet and unexpected. I just imagine this big tough man on his laptop signing up a little dwarf hamster to be a hamsternaut to make a girl smile. It worked.

174,"When Roseanne was first airing I remember thinking it was cool that one of her best friend's was black.  Rewatching it as an adult, I realized that the black friends are only there when everyone is there (like for a Mother's Day BBQ) or when issues of race come up (""Our son doesn't want to kiss a black girl in the school play, have we done something wrong in our parenting?"").  

Same with gay characters to some extent.  I remember being happy that they even had gay characters and even one whose sexuality wasn't his #1 personality trait.  But rewatching it, the gay characters are super stereotypical and their sexuality is the butt of the joke more often than not."

186,"In middle school, I got my period in class once and bled through my jeans. When class was over, I did the typical sweatshirt around the waist and started for the batbroom. One of the super popular girls comes up next to me and asks if I need a tampon. I was ready to cry with how nice and discreet she was being. Since then I never gone anywhere without one. "
187,"When faced with any mundane decision - ""I don't care, I'll let you decide"". Like it's a favor to me to have to choose dinner, date location, movie, etc. every single time. To be fair I'm sure this isn't a man specific thing. "
188,"Aw, I found that a little disappointing. Just pics of forearms? I like to see them as part of the whole package. It's like seeing a closeup pic of a dick. It's just there looking veiny and dumb.

190,"The DIY waterproof phone case using a balloon.

It literally was blowing up a balloon, placing the phone on top, deflating the balloon, and having it ""shrink wrap"" the back of the phone.

So not only is it nowhere near waterproof, it also covered up your speakers/headphone jack/charger jack/etc., probably made your phone overheat, and finally, *you have a damn balloon on your phone and you're calling it a phone case.*"

I live for the tight black pants, tight black shirt, combat boots, baggy red plaid over shirt look. I even recently bought red plaid sheets for my otherwise black bed. "
194,"Well, my story has a happy ending that is in progress. 

I was crushing pretty hard on a guy who caught my train on the daily. We also caught the same bus home in the afternoons. I was new to the city but he caught my eye in that first week. Weeks went passed with me trying no to stare but to try and get the same carriage with letting him feel like he had a stalker (fine line :/) and then I was gonna move houses. To the other side of the city. So I made a move, I tapped him on the shoulder, as he turned slowly, my heart felt like it was going to implode and the thumping in me ears was deafening... I stammered out some incoherent words and gave him my business card with my private mobile number on it. I thought that my poorly articulated stalker moment wouldn't yield results...

Well, we have been together for almost 2 years now. Apparently, I was his commute crush too!

It has been the best relationship I have had and even though I get embarrassed to admit that I made the first and somewhat awkward first move, I can't argue with a ""happily ever after"".

Or, when a guy ha strong hands and arms. I don't need or lust over a six pack, a little squishy in the middle is cool with me, but nice arms make me swoon. As I tell my friends, I like a man who could kill me with his bare hands lol"
197,When a guy is taking off his belt and he has to pull it tightly for just a second to get the metal thingy out of the belt hole. Idk why but something about the motion really...stirs me.

199,"Scarlett Johansson. Don't get me wrong - the girl isn't ugly. I just don't see the big ""WOW"" factor in her.

Most of the women I think are stunning are already seen that way by the majority - Margot Robbie, Olivia Wilde, etc."
200,"I have lost 40 pounds on purpose. I never get sick of people reacting to it!

What I do get sick of, honestly, is when people begin making unsolicited excuses for themselves. ""Oh, I could never do that! My metabolism is too slow/I love beer and pizza too much/I hate sweating. etc.""

I worked hard to lose and maintain my weight loss, and I resent the idea that I'm somehow less fun, eat gross food, or partake in inhuman levels of exercise.

201,"Is Dabbing still a trend?

Because the car commercial I saw sure as hell thinks it still is.  Freaking 9 year olds dabbing because they're car elves or something."
202,I had an ex rip my car window out with his bare hands. His hands were all bloody.... scariest shit ever. I gtfo of there fast 
203,"Yeah, and then you should lie down on a great big sheet of aluminum foil while tanning. Make sure to turn around every 15 minutes to get an even tan.  Also, did you know that fresh rosemary and thyme are really good at absorbing the good sunrays while helping to block the bad ones? You should try it!"

205,"I got tired of washing his huge ugly dirty dish pile that he would leave on the computer desk. Normally dishes would pile higher and higher until I got tired of it and washed them. 

But then I realized he was leaving them there *because* I was washing him and his ass was being lazy. Wtf dude.

Seriously, every day I was cleaning up this guys ridiculous mess from basically all his collective meals from the day literally stacked one on top of the other- plates, bowls, cups and all, in front of the computer. I hate doing dishes to begin with.

I know my SO. He picks up after himself once he gets sick of looking at a mess...but it takes a while for him to get to that point once he gets set in his ways.

So I let his dish pile grow. I wouldnt touch it. I let it grow until he had to reach around his dishes in order to play computer games. Oh and he did there for a while, stubbornly. I watched it bother him, wordlessly,......snickering on the inside, marveling in his discomfort. 

I let this happen again and again, each time he gave up and washed his dishes the next pile would get smaller before he gave up and did it again.

And thats how I got him to start doing his dishes again. 

Pretty passive aggressive of me but I have no regrets. "
206,"Don't stop running - you will get fat and unfit and it's easier to carry on running than start it up again!

207,Definitely! How could I not? 
208,"The first one....seems not bad?

I'm sure I'm not the only desi girl who appreciates this trend...we've been thinking that our eyebrows are ugly for years."
209,"I had a kind of opposite experience. 

There was a professor in my masters program who was so fucking hot. 

I never took a class with him but we crossed paths in a few contexts and the chemistry was palpable. 

I asked him to be on my thesis committee and he declined. 

I was so completely shocked that I almost burst into tears sitting in the chair across from his desk. My face was just burning hot with shame. 

He handed me my outline and there were was scribbling all over it - typical academic stuff. I didn't read anything there. I just thanked him for his time and excused myself as quickly as possible. 

I sat in the parking garage and cried until I felt able to drive. I called my mom, hysterical, and told her everything. We tried to figure out why he wouldn't want to be part of my team. I blew off a lot of steam. 

After a rest, I sat down and read his notes. They were smart and helpful. Then, buried on page 3 was a post it note; actually, it was two post it notes - the top one was blank. 

When I lifted the blank one, I saw a note hidden underneath. ""I'd really like to talk to you in a personal context,"" and a phone number. 

I called a FWB and worked off my excitement, so as not to seem to eager. 

I called him the next day and he immediately told me that he was so sorry that I was hurt by his unwillingness to serve on my committee. 

He told me that he would love to explain, in person, but that I needed to consider this a personal matter, not a professional one. 

We met for drinks the next day. He was on his second cocktail when I arrived. Half way through his third, he told me about how he was wildly attracted to me and had been working hard to suppress it and couldn't possibly be professional toward me on my committee. 

We fucked on the regular until I came back as faculty and it would have been kinda a mess. Nobody has ever spent more time giving me head in my life than him. The dude like really, really liked going down. 

God bless him. 

"
210,"When he let our more easily scared daughter go into her school's haunted house for halloween because she assured him she wouldn't get scared. spoiler alert, she was fucking terrified and cried for the next two hours. I made him sleep in their bedroom that night. ""You deserve this"" I said as I tucked them all in. ""I know"" he replied."
211,When your broken bits match up with kindness. 
212,"New fitted plain white tshirt with jeans

But not dingy white or baggy.  "
213,"Seconded on Instagram style makeup. Like I love makeup, but it seems the look of the moment is very heavy handed and stylised. Everyone kind of looks the same and a little uncanny valley. All highlighter, eyebrows, contour, and overlined matte lips. When you're being that heavy handed with makeup, you gotta know what you're doing or else it looks like you've been shot with homer's makeup gun."
214,"Even in a forum full of women talking about their experiences with misogyny, there will still be dudes who deny it happens. "
215,"Couple weeks ago I got out of the shower to find my boyfriend silently sitting still in my living room, visibly upset. I sat down, put my arm around him and asked what was wrong. He shrugged, started tearing up and said, ""They just sound so sad."" 

His ex didn't show up after promising his kids a fun event, no call no show. (She got wasted instead, and lied about it.)  The kids were with grandma who called to tell him what happened while I was washing my hair. 

Seeing how helpless, sad, protective and loving he was in that moment just wrecked me."
216,"I hate it when people (especially men) call women females. It has seriously become a pet peeve. It makes me feel like I'm on the animal planet when someone uses that term about women.

221,"Right now it's Chris Evans. He isn't even that striking... I mean he's really just a generic white guy with blond hair and blue. Not usually my type. But every time I see him on screen ... I just lose my mind a little. I have seen those goddamn Captain America movies WAY to many times. 

As for women Halle Berry circa 2001 or whenever she has that super cute pixie cut makes me stop in my tracks. She has been my crush since I was a wee lass. To me she is incredibly beautiful. "
222,"I think this is going to be pretty unique to every relationship. Some people make it work out just fine, some don't. For both my SO and I....we kind of don't see the point. Our exes were parts of our past that are no longer relevant to our future. So I can't see a time where I'd feel the need to talk to my ex of all people vs either my SO or my other friends. Same with my SO."
223,"He's sexist and immature. There are no excuses, women make up 50% of the population. "
224,"Ugh my work crush did this yesterday. Nice dude, jokes a lot, but isn't flirtatious at all (strict boundaries with coworkers that I obviously respect). He made a joke at the expense of another coworker and then turned to me and winked and my heart stopped."
225,"I was down for almost a month with this unshakeable respiratory infection. This dude... Took my grocery list while I wasn't paying attention and went shopping for me so I didn't have to try to breathe in the cold.

231,"Yeah, I hate that there's this idea that men never rant or blow off steam or whatever.  ""Men are problem solvers, women just want to be listened to!""  Okay, so you really think my dad five states away is complaining about his co-worker being unsafe because he thinks I can offer some kind of solution?  Of course not, he just wants to complain to someone.  It's cool, everybody does it.  "

244,Some girls at school were pretty nasty to me about my thick eyebrows in the era you're talking about so I took a tweezer to mine and didn't do a good job at first. So many bad photos exist of me with really obviously uneven brows! I managed to get them a lot neater but idk I feel kind of resentful now that people are falling over themselves to have really thick eyebrows when I had a lovely natural pair - that I can't get back because over a decade of plucking means they don't grow back neat like they once were. So I have to keep plucking them or else I have a load of random messy black hairs above my eyelids.

247,Here's [the original ice soap post!](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/jinex/shower_to_go/)
248,"

My best friend is white. I go with her to events, and I'm the only black person. But she also goes with me to events where she is the only white person. we share in each others lives, I'm not just an accessory in hers!

So many tv shows paint it like we are just accessories that show up as like a condiment in the white lead character's lives, but you never get to see the white characters be an accessory or condiment in the black friend's life."
249,My girlfriend does this. She's only seen me shave twice and both times she looks like a cat gazing into a Christmas tree... only hornier. 
250,I still do that when I have a sweater but don't feel like carrying it. 
251,"Emma Watson. Maybe it's just that a huge amount of men grew up watching her in the Harry Potter movies, and those teenage crushes have carried over into adulthood? She seems like a nice enough person, though."

254,"I'm a lesbian so it's a constant internal struggle like... do I want to BE her or be ON her???

The answer is yes."
255,"When we were in high school, my boyfriend told me he didn't like me wearing short shorts because he didn't want other guys to look at me. The next day, I put on my shortest, cutest pair of pink shorts that were guaranteed attention. 

He knows better than to make suggestions about my looks now!  

Quick edit: not abusive, good heavens. We were teenagers. He's over the jealousy thing. "
256,I once gave a SO basketball shorts in a Victoria's Secret box.
257,"And fucking yogurt commercials! I've seen ONE with a man in it and the whole joke was that he thought it was pudding, so their yogurt is so delicious even a *man* would eat it. "
258,Don't get in a relationship until you're in a healthy relationship with yourself. 
259,"I'm friends with both of my exes. As long as it's a real friendship and they can set their boundaries, it would be fine."
260,"I look *very* young, like I'm nearly 21 and I get mistaken for a high school freshman very regularly. I've had men who are probably in their late forties try to hit on me that have only targeted me because they think I'm young and impressionable. There was one that even yelled at me for lying about my age because there was no way that I wasn't 16. It's a very gross feeling. Men that age who go after such young girls are predators and it's scary to be targeted by them."
261,"Give yourself an extra few minutes to do all the things you need to get ready, and be realistic about how much time it takes you. I'm super punctual, my brother is ALWAYS late. Some differences I notice: 

He always shorts himself on time. He thinks it'll take him 10 minutes to shower, another 5 to get ready, and 15 minutes to get somewhere. So he starts getting ready 30 minutes before he needs to be there. The reality is, he takes 20 minute showers, 10-15 minutes to get ready, and it's a 20 minute drive, so he's automatically late. If anything comes up (traffic, etc) he's even more late. 

Me on the other hand - I'm honest with myself about how long it takes me to do those things, then still give myself extra time just in case. I take 10 minute showers so I give myself 15. Takes me another 10 to get ready, so I give myself another 15. If it's a 20 minute drive, I give myself 25 minutes. So I start getting ready basically 55 minutes before I have to be there. I'm often early, but that's preferable. 

Funnily enough, I'm typing this while sitting in my car at work because I don't have to be in for another 6 minutes. I got here 8 minutes ago. :P"
262,"We have a 2.5 yo boy and 1 yo twins. We are tired and sex has to wait until kids are asleep but we average to about 3 times a week. 

I also feel much sexier and more horny after I started exercising 3 times a week. It gives me more energy and my knees don't give in too quickly. We also experiment more than we did before kids. 

Edit: we also never co-slept. It's difficult first month and then kids got used to sleeping 8 + 4 hours. Even the twins. It was one of the best decisions we made. Now they are on a 11-12 hour sleep through the night and we have lovely evenings."
263,"I don't understand the hype about Kate Upton. I just.... Really don't get it. 

Charlize Theron might be one of the most beautiful women on the planet. "
264,"THIS. No idea why, but watching any man tie a tie is so incredibly hot. Even in movies, I need to divert my eyes because it gets me so hot and bothered. "
265,Mojitos man. I could drink a pitcher for breakfast. Probably margaritas too. All beer.
266,Lol thats kinda adorable.
267,I would get 300 days a year! Hahahah! I approve of this plan. 
268,"I'm a graduate student in Logic, Computation, and Methodology! I was given my own computer at the age of eight and I learned HTML and CSS. Then I started working at fourteen doing web development for real estate companies all over the US. I used this money to switch to private school. In college I changed my major every week freshman year before deciding to make my own. I had to petition an academic board and work closely with faculty to design my major, but it was approved! I graduated in May, and now I'm at Carnegie Mellon concentrating on modal logic to diagram technical systems. :D"
269,"I'm more comfortable with people who don't see me as something to fuck. Their sexuality has nothing to do with it, their shittiness vs not-shittiness does."
270,The irony is real.
271,"Definitely do sunscreen. I've been wearing it daily since I was 16-17 and now I'm 38 I've only just got the beginning hint of a wrinkle on my forehead, and I've really got to look for it. 
Keep on top of debt as much as possible. Save as much as you can. Travel while you're still fairly unfettered by life. Have fun too. "
272,Aziz Ansari in everything he does
273,Or worse when the male-female dynamics of Muslim people are nice quiet lady in a hijab who only nods when her overbearing husband speaks. Most hijabis I know would probably never put up with a guy like that in real life.
274,"My dad would have considered bringing me into the family business in a leadership position instead of hiring me as a receptionist and holding out for my only brother, who is fourteen years younger than me and presently ten."
275,"Matt Bomer is weird for me. Like, he is objectively very attractive but I personally don't find him attractive? Does that even make sense?"
276,"Yup, I gave up drinking and still love a Virgin Mary (or, as the barman insists on calling it, a 'Bloody Shame')"
277,It would also be underwhelming for the people who get 0.

279,"When she gently brushes my hair out of my face when I'm kissing her, or... y'know. I melt!"
280,That short pause before answering a serious question. 
281,"I don't like Robin from how I met your mother. It's nothing about specific interactions, I just hate her overall character.  She's bitter and rude. "
282,"I think it also depends on the ex. Like if they were married and share custody, I'd hope they were friendly. If it was someone who mistreated them, I'd worry. If it was an ex who they dated in high school and it fizzled out, that's hardly worth jealousy. If it was someone who they were very recently serious with and they only hang exclusively, that's something to suspect."
283,"Background: we prank each other a lot, and he particularly likes to prank me by startling me as he presses something very cold to my back/neck/whatever. I have terrible temperature management. Sometimes I'll be terribly hot, sometimes terribly cold. It's just my feet though, the rest of my body is usually fine. He does not understand this at all but I don't either so that makes two.

So one evening I was lying on the couch and my feet were BURNING. Legitimately, they felt scorching hot. I tried watering them under the tap but nothing would help. He asked me if I was having hot feet again and I said yes. He sighed, got up, walked to the bed and got a huge bottle filled with frozen water out from under the bed. Him: ""I was going to prank you with this, but anyway, here."" He wrapped it up in a towel so my feet wouldn't freeze to the bottle and positioned it under my feet so I could cool them. 

He forfeited a prank to keep me comfortable and that was just the sweetest thing."
284,I used to turn on my read receipts whenever my ex was pissing me off so he knew I read his text but wasn't responding. 
285,"&gt;Calling women females.


The way some people use it (particularly online) has this weird 'othering' effect. You know the type of people I mean ‡∞†_‡∞†"
286,"A couple of years ago, my ex and I had these massive fights about money. He got a new job that required him to travel a lot and basically supported both of us. I had just lost my job, so I was looking for a new one, working a minimum wage job, and keeping busy on my own projects. 

At one point, he was gone for about a month. During this time, he decided he needed a new piece of equipment that was very expensive. I told him we couldn't afford it, laid out the facts, and he bought it anyway. 

When he got back, he checked our bank account and found that we had less money than he thought. He immediately accused me of ""spending all of his money,"" told me I ""chose the dumbest career path ever,"" and that he was tired of having to always support me financially (I called my mother that day, sobbing, and my mother, who is an accountant and did both of our taxes every year, straight up pulled out our tax returns and confirmed this was not true).

He even told his dad, right in front of me, that I ""hadn't been contributing."" 

It was one of the lowest points of my life. I have always been a very independent and hard-working person, so to be made to feel like I was mooching on the man I loved when I was in a difficult transitionary period with my career was devastating. "
287,"The number of friends and family I have who will have happy, healthy, enjoyable lives.  "
288,THIS THIS THIS! THIS is (one reason) why women hate dick pics. I want to see the whole thing not just the wiener or the arm or the whatever. 
289,"I have a friend, well we met on COD on PSN lol but he lived nearby and we became friends, anyways, he had this long term girlfriend before that he was telling me about, she moved for college for a year and they stopped talking for over three months before he finally reached out to her, thats exactly what she was doing waiting to see how long it took him to call cause she was always calling. Three freaking months. And he was surprised she considered them broken up!! I dont talk to someone for three months Im gonna consider us broken up lol"
290,"I don't call that emotional intelligence.  I call that emotional control.  Emotional intelligence to me is reading and knowing emotions based on a person's behavior, and then usually responding in an appropriate way that will cause them to feel better or whatever.  It's being aware of what's going on with a person's emotions. "
291,Yup! Can you imagine what it is like to be a teenager now? How do we expect them to grow into well-rounded people when every mistake they make can be photographed and posted to shame them.
292,"While I can't speak to his actual capacity for emotional labor, (as I am not in a relationship with him) I have a friend who I frequently describe as ""the nicest guy ever"" because he's demonstrably thoughtful, and I have to assume thoughtfulness translates to being capable in emotional labor kinds of ways. My husband is great at both. 

Examples being: friend always is the one to ask about or suggest meal options if he thinks a get together will run long into a typical eating time. He remembers people's allergies. He reached out to me last weekend before a snow storm came through to offer that my husband and I stay at his house because I was past my due date and he lives only five minutes from the hospital. He wishes people happy birthday by reaching out personally instead of just a Facebook post. When someone makes a vague suggestion (""let's all go to GenCon next year"") he's the one creating a group to communicate about actually making plans.

Tl;dr: my guess is that people who demonstrate empathy are probably good at emotional labor."
293,"&gt; Being able to admit when they don't know something

This is it for me."
294,"One time I got really ill from an infection. We made an emergency trip to the after-hours doctor. I asked if he could give me something for the pain I was in and the doctor gave me paracetamol but in a suppository form because that's apparently more effective.

Went home, boyfriend at the time (now husband!) tucked me in, got me ready and then I was like ""omg I've never taken a suppository before...do I just put it in my butt?"" and in the sweetest, most earnest tone he just looked at me and asked ""Do you need help?"" The man was going to stick a pill in my butt for me. I mean, he didn't, but it was the completely honest way he asked, like no problem I will stick that in your butt for you to make you feel better. 

Right now our cat is super sick and I've been sleeping on the couch to look after her in the night. She's incontinent, AND a cuddler, so I'm getting peed on a lot. I woke husband up at 6am and and just PASSED out in our bed. He took over taking care of kitty. When I woke up, he'd ordered a kid's play pen from Amazon Prime, set it up, and had kitty in her own little fortress so that now I can sleep better.

Yeah, he's a keeper.

He's not romantic in the flowers and jewelry sense, and that's fine with me, because goddamnit he is there when I need him and he's just a big stupid face.

295,Don't go to law school. Do something you actually like.
296,"friendships are going to shift, and you will probably lose some people you never thought you would. adult friendships are so different from the friendships you form as children, and even in college. 

life comes in stages, and you won't always be at the same stage as the other people your age. yes yes, we know, everyone around you is having babies and you're just binge-watching whatever on Netflix. but where you might throw yourself headfirst into your career and be making the big bucks, your friend might hit 28 and still not know what to do with their life. it's all normal."

301,"On the other hand I think skinny jeans suit pretty much everyone, as long as they fit."
302,"Yes, yes, yes.


Because here in the good ole US of A I've been told point blank by employers that I won't be hired because I'm a woman and they didn't believe I could do the job.  It's a common attitude in my field, every woman I know has a similar story.

305,"I can't rely on motivation to maintain my workout routine tbh. Motivation is a fickle, exhaustible resource, and some days it really just isn't there. I have to tell myself it's another responsibility, just like going to work every day, or brushing my teeth.  

To me, dragging myself to the gym is like a second job that I get paid for in confidence instead of money. Thinking about it that way has gotten me to stick to it better than anything else has."
306,insisting on ''discussion'' of the ''facts'' to clear the air and pave the way for reconciliation when the problem is the fact that they're an insufferable jackass incapable of empathy.

He said the right things. We connected in all the right ways. We passionately agreed (and disagreed) with the same parts of life. **WE GOT EACH OTHER**. Sometimes we swore we heard the others thoughts in our heads, despite never being spoken out loud. It was weird and crazy and unreal, and we were both drawn to each other over and over again, no matter the distance or time passing. He would leave relationships to come back to me. We could never stay away from each other, and constantly sought each other out over the years.  

One day I thought to myself, ""we only talk when he gets ahold of me"".   

I resisted the thought, I made excuses, I came up with all sorts of reasons (that he supported) for why I was there for him when he wanted me to be and not the other way around. Any time I wanted him, I was brushed off - made fun of or demeaned, left hanging and waiting for a glimmer of acknowledgement. But I kept trying, and agreeing with his reasons and suppressing my own feelings about it.  

The tipping point was after an 8 or 12 month disengagement by him, can't remember the exact time. He called me out of the blue in the evening, around 11pm IIRC. We chatted for a bit, and then I tried to say that I was hurt by him not staying in touch, and that I really cared for him and would like it if we could talk more regularly and stay in contact. He said I was out of line and putting limits on him, creating things in my mind that didn't exist, and needed to respect his individuality. We went back and forth for a bit, then he hung up on me. When I called him back, he yelled at me for calling back so late and potentially waking his family (mother and brothers that he was staying with), and then called me ""a hater"". I told him he called me first, and I wasn't ""a hater"", I was expressing my own feelings about us, not judging. He kept name-calling and taunting, and I eventually hung up. He then called me over and over for half an hour, until I unplugged my phone for several hours (this was in the landline-only days).  

To be fair, yeah, I WAS creating things that didn't exist. What didn't exist was our relationship. He knew that all along, unfortunately. 

He got ahold of me a couple years later, on IM/chat. He approached me by saying ""whats up"". That's it, that's all. I responded by saying he acted like a piece-of-shit in our last conversation by pretending nothing ever existed between us, but I forgave him. I understood he was going through things in his own life and couldn't properly respect me, and while I didn't appreciate how he basically treated me like an on-call whore, it was OK now. That was then, and this is now. I no longer wanted to be with him or communicate in any way, but I still loved him and wished him well in wherever his life would take him, and best of luck.   

His response? ""Get lost loser, OMG, I knew you had issues before but clearly you're still a mess now. Wow, get a life"".  

I consider it a win in the end. "

After weeks of guilt he just had to tell me that when the surgeon attempted to stop the seizing he botched it, that she should still be alive and that we should hire a lawyer. Since we were only engaged there was nothing I could do about it and her parents chose to do nothing as well. "

This year he, and our children (who are younger than 12) didn't do anything. I thought they were pulling my leg. Nope. I didn't even get a card. If I hadn't said it was my birthday they wouldn't have even wished me a happy birthday. He took me out for breakfast because we hadn't eaten, so it was just another day.

It sounds stupid. But it hurt more than anything over the last 14 years with him. "
323,"My wife was approached by 3 men in a car who were making her feel very uncomfortable. She was walking our dog with out 6 month old baby. And they wanted to know the dogs breed and then said they wanted the dog. She said at first she thought they were joking but then it became apparent they wanted to actually take our dog (she's a gorgeous pit bull). 

A man walked by and asked her if everything was all right. She said she was just leaving and he walked with her a while. 

Simply adding yourself to the equation, regardless of what you say, gives the woman the opportunity to leave and changes the dynamic enough that the man may back off. "

336,"Watching him work. He's in construction, and watching his brain work the math and then his muscles moving to make it happen is sexy as all get out. "
337,"Having the sassy loud black girl or hood black guy.

Having black people speak in slang or Ebonics or in a way they would never have a white character speak. I feel like I haven't seen 1 show or movie where a black actor doesn't speak in some sort of broken English or like they just left the hood. And if they do its portrayed like they're ""acting white"" for comedy.

The very obvious token black friend who has no character development and is only there to further a white characters story.

Asians as super meek/submissive or always having an accent(same w/ latinos). 

Absolutely hate the white saviour complex.

Only having a huge number of black and Hispanic actors when it has to do with prison or crime or violence.

Black/latino characters always have some sort of struggle.. poverty, racism, crime etc. Why cant they be some middle class/well off person living their life or various other roles that are given to white people.

I feel like I barely see asians in roles at all, especially as the main character, except to play the nerd, cute girl, or in a karate movie. "
338,"This is just a personal reflection but, you really do change a lot in your 20s... I was with a guy from age 19-22 and I committed so fast without really knowing myself fully. I found myself changing and what i wanted out of a relationship changing.

It's so cliche to say but really, don't hurry into a commitment so early!"
339,My boyfriend is in regular contact with his ex because they have a kid together and have to make arrangements regarding her. I'm fine with that. I'd also be fine with him casually keeping in touch with other exes.

348,"For context the day before my birthday my then boyfriend and I had spent the day at sixflags. When we got back to his place we pretty much showered and passed out. Tired from working all week and then being out in the sun. I woke up because I could hear music. I roll over and see my boyfriend is gone. I lay there confused and want to get up and investigate. Then it occurs to me the song being sung is ""Feliz Cumplea√±os"" my then boyfriend's is Mexican, his first language is Spanish.  So I made myself presentable and went out into the kitchen. In the middle of the night he got up and picked up a couple of his friends to come serenade me. Fully dressed in traditional mariachi clothing. They sang me a few songs and then he had to take them back home.

That was by far the sweetest and most romantic thing I've ever had someone do for me. I felt so special and loved in that moment. "

357,"I've told this before and I feel the need to preface this with how unimportant he made me feel during sex because even though I was very vocal about what I wanted, he never did any of it. So once after he got off during sex, I knew it was over cause he wasn't gonna keep doing anything for me as usual, I said ""you suck at sex"" with such hate in my voice. His face immediately changed to hurt. I felt terrible. Truth is, he did suck at sex. But idk. While he needed some reality slapped into him, I know it hurt hearing it from someone he loved. "

-He makes sure to tell me I look pretty each time we see each other. He always compliments my outfits, too.

Every day he blows me away with how sweet and considerate he is. He always takes the time to make sure I feel cared about. All the swoonage."

368,"Emotional intelligence is something I look for in both women and men, but it's something I don't see as much in men (this is a generalization of course, and based on only my personal experience). I can best describe it as being able to separate feelings and logic and air them both so that the person can find the subtlety in between them. 

For example: let's say my friend Argo was in a fight with a friend that got nasty while drinking, and in the heat of the moment his friend said something personal and unforgivable (in Argo's mind) in front of a large group of people. He wants nothing more than to flip the table over, yell, never talk to the guy again, yada yada yada. He can handle this in a variety of different ways, but I admire it when people can take the emotional high road even when the situation is emotionally volatile because it shows *emotional intelligence*. Saying something like ""Hey, that went too far man,"" and leaving, would be the obvious ""right"" response (to me) in that situation, and even if a lot of 'bros' would consider that a weak or cowardly exit... flipping out and getting pissed is easy, controlling it because you're the better person is hard.

It also broke my heart how little he actually cared about what I wanted in my future. He just expected me to go along with whatever he wanted.  
These were all issues that led to our break up. The fact that these actions broke my heart meant I knew deep down we'd have to break up. It just took me a long ass time to get to that point. "

As long as the topic doesn't get into the how's and why's of the person's weight loss, you're golden. That was always the uncomfortable one, because the answer of ""eat less, move more"" wasn't the glamorous answer."

He found out she owned thong underwear, and he strangled her against her bedroom wall with her feet off the floor, called her a (expletive that demeans women). She survived and he was charged with domestic assault. 

He was buddies with the county attorney where he was charged and everything was dropped. On top of that, he got his records expunged so no one could see it on his record.

383,"When they make every black person from the 50s talk with a super southern twang and broken english.

Ex: The movie Red Tails, about the Tuskegee airmen. 

All of those pilots were top of the line and highly educated because they had this super hard test they had to pass with a perfect score and during Jim Crow times, it was rigged to be so difficult that no one would pass. The guys who passed it were incredibly intelligent and educated.  But when Hollywood makes the movie, they have a guy chewing on a toothpick speaking broken english and acting goofy. 

Black people have been highly educated and amazing speakers throughout the history of the US, but please find a movie that shows anyone as such.   

When will we see someone who speaks like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_hYraYI2J8 in a movie set in the 50s?

Also a problem! I HATE the HELP!!! The black people are just vehicles for the white women's morality and character development and they are given lesser position as if it's some sort of gift! The black woman's happy ending?

Now she's starting to reach back out and try and be friends again.

The thing is that I don't miss her at all.  I realized I was the only one making the effort in our friendship.  I would make plans and 50% of the time she would bail the last minute.  So I'll be nice, I'll be kind, but I'm not going to make the effort anymore."

405,"- Know how to cook, clean and wash clothes, and actually do them. No one wants to be a parent to their adult partner.

- Be trustworthy, reliable, honest and respectful. A decent human being basically. Treat others how you would like to be treated.

- Have no prejudice. Don't think a woman is angry because ""she's on her period"", or that women don't like sex or any other stupid stereotypes.

- Nurture the relationship. Don't think that attraction can't die.

- Be sexually responsible. Don't assume every woman is on the pill (there are many side effects of hormonal birth control. Learn them before you want someone to take them.)"

Along those lines, the frumpy wife that never puts out. Again, how often is it directly related to the effort dwindling on BOTH sides?? I don't think marriage is a death sentence for your sex life, at all, if both parties keep trying to seduce, talk, touch, be sexy.

417,"The most important thing is trusting your partner. If they act shady, or if you have other reasons not to trust them, you got bigger fish to fry than an ex. A cheater /lier can always find a willing partner. "
418,Butterfly clips....I wouldn't be caught dead wearing them now though lol
419,"Related: parents who take and post really inappropriate/gross photos of their children, that the kids themselves are too young to be aware of or properly object to, with no regards to how the child will be affected by it later, or how they would feel if they could understand. "
420,"Welp, I need to get my tie tying skills up to snuff"
421,"I didn't know anything about reddit several years ago.  I was seeing a guy at the time who frequently visited and commented.  After we broke up, I looked up his account and saw him saying some pretty egregious shit about me (nothing identifying, but just fucked up/wrong), and I copy/pasted some of it to pretty much say ""fuck you"" to him (which was very immature of me).

His only question was how I found him and how horrible it was for me to ""pry.""  I was like, dude you sat next time me on your laptop, night after night logged in to reddit; I have eyeballs, I can read your username.

I didn't know at the time what a big fucking deal it was to know someone's handle.  Now I understand.  

In addition to complaining about me/bragging about himself, he also liked to give lots of shitty relationship advice that made me laugh because I actually knew his deal, and I would never suggest taking any of his advice.  "
422,"A few days ago, we were supposed to get ramen with our 2 friends from out of town like a usual Sunday. The thing is, I always work at 5pm. So we go, we eat and hang out a bit and we come back down to where we live. (About an 45min-1hour drive) We're always super excited to go every time but at last minute, he remembered he had to go to his work's Christmas party. We were both super bummed that we couldn't go like usual. Even more so then, I was bummed that he was going to go anyway while I was at work. I joked that he should bring me a doggy bag of leftovers. Anyway, point is that I got out of work and made my way to my car, and I heard his car's engine. I directed my attention to where the sound was coming from, and sure enough he's parked right outside of my work. I went up to the window, asked ""what are you doing here?!"" And he handed me my Taro milk tea, my favorite bubble tea from Quickly; along with my own serving of ramen. I was so excited, speechless and over all so thankful for the kind deed."
423,"Right??

My mom saw pictures of me at a campus event my freshman year with some friends and the guy I was currently seeing. One of said friends was dressed as Tony the Tiger and sitting 15 feet up in a tree. Mom thought he looked like 'my type.' I laughed cause the guy I was with was definitely a catch and Tony had a long-term girlfriend.

Eight years later and I'm married to Tony the Tiger. Things are GRRRRRRREEEAAAAAAT!"
424,It worked for his husband.
