0,"Sklyer White (Breaking Bad) - Her husband is emotionally unavailable when he gets his diagnosis and then learns he is a drug producer and and then a murderer. Of course that would freak anyone out. She isn't the villain, Walt is. 

ChiChi  (Dragon Ball Z) - Is it so wrong that she wants her son to study so he does not turn out like his idiot father who only cares about fighting shit. Plus she is the one doing almost all of the heavy lifting in parenting. "
1,Sansa Stark.
2,"I found out my ex is pretty much the least responsible person with money ever.  Among other things, he had no bank account and literally kept cash in a shoebox under his bed.  He would forget to cash paychecks and borrow money from people for a month until he went in to cash them.  

I tried to put up with it for a while and help him deal with it, but general financial stupid was probably the number one reason we broke up."
3,"I don't have a ton of concrete evidence for this but generally, right after you break up, you should feel relieved. It's normal to feel sad because of the situation, but the balance of relief vs regret in your gut should give you a good indication of how you truly feel"
4,"I walked in on my parents when I was a kid, saw my dad's penis, and thought it was a tail growing from his vagina."
5,"Teaching and nursing are the first two that spring to mind, teaching especially. Having positive adult men as a nurturing, caring influence on children would be super useful in dissolving gender roles. "
6,"I have quite a few, but I went on a date with a guy I met online. We met at a local restaurant and he asked me if his jacket looked familiar. I was puzzled and said no. He said ""It's [guy who dated and abused my best friend]'s jacket"" and my blood just ran cold.

Apparently this guy recognized my pictures from photos with my best friend since we have never met. I was just like ""uh. . .are you kidding me? You know that guy is in prison for trying to kill my best friend?"" He said ""Yeah, I've visited him in jail. I've heard her side of the story"" and he rolled his eyes. 

I said ""yeah, this is really fucked up, I'm leaving now."" He was absolutely SHOCKED! ""I can't believe you're leaving! I was trying to be honest with you upfront! I even brought you a bottle of wine!"" 

I bolted to my car and left him standing in the restaurant looking flabbergasted. I called my BFF and she laughed her ass off and told me I should have asked for the jacket since she paid for it. "
7,"Asking the woman's father for permission to marry his daughter (or for the parents' ""blessing""). "
8,"He plays with our daughter's heart. She's seven. 

He sees her about 1-2 times a year. Christmas and her birthday (half of the time). He is allowed to see her whenever he wants and we live in the same city. He still only sees her once or twice a year and I suspect it's because his parents ask where she is on Christmas or her birthday, not because he cares at all. 

He sees her just often enough to make it really hurt. She adores him. After she sees him, she cries because she misses him and wants to see him more. This goes on for months until she finally hardens her heart and then it's about time for him to rip the wound open and see her again. I wish he would just decide to either be involved or abandon her altogether instead of constantly wounding her. 

I thought about just not allowing him to see her anymore but I'm not going to be the one my daughter blames for keeping her and her dad apart. She has to realize he's a dick on her own. The second she tells me she doesn't want to see him anymore I'll oblige but not before that. Luckily were moving soon so I figure after that, he won't bother to travel to see her. 

One time he asked to see her out of the blue. I asked him why once he brought her home, you know, just casually because it's really out of character for him. Maybe he was finally missing her? No. He said he took our daughter with him on a first date  with a women he knew who liked kids because he thought it would help grease the wheels and show her he was a good dad. I was furious. 

I don't hate him for the seven times I caught him cheating when we were together. I don't hate him for the psychological abuse. I don't hate him for making me work two jobs while going to school full time and having to do all the housework so he could play video games all day and do nothing else. I don't hate him for the endless nights crying myself to sleep or the way he isolated me from my family. To hate him for Those things would mean there were still fucks to give about our relationship. I have no fucks for that. do however have a lot of fucks to give about my daughter. "
9,"He was just a gross roommate. I'm not the cleanest or most organized person, but I'm a clutter kind of messy...not a dirty kind of messy. He literally peed in the bathroom sink. Not when he was drunk or when I was using the toilet and he really had to go. All the time. Our sink was stained yellow when I moved out. He left dishes in the sink for ages. He had a towel that he jacked off into that just kind of hung out next to his bed and he continued to use until I would secretly wash it.

I moved out because I was moving to go to grad school and not because of any of those reasons, but once I was living without him, I knew I could never live with him again. We are no longer together.

Edit: The sink he peed in and the sink he left dishes in were not the same sink."
10,"Mine: I used to think sex was like an injection and there was no movement other than ""insert penis once.""  

My brother probably takes the cake though.  When he first found out what sex was he was in elementary school, and he assumed (God knows why) that the man's penis had to be amputated and permanently put into the woman's vagina for eternity and the baby would be made out of the penis."
11,"Skyler from *Breaking Bad*

Jenny from *Forrest Gump*. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/18lvwe/who_is_the_most_misunderstood_character_in_all_of/c8g4njy) is one of my favorite Reddit answers of all time."
12,Saw him at the bar before he saw me - he ordered 3 shots and downed them all in quick succession. Ended up being a raging asshole throughout the date and told me I better stop looking so cute or he might have to rape me. 
13,"I love how women look out for each other. They'll flip your tag if it's outside your shirt, lend you their jacket if you bled through your pants, and travel with you to your car so you get there safe. I also love how nice most women get when they drink. All my friends just sit around crying about how beautiful everybody is when they get drunk."
14,"The driver behind me was way to close and wouldn't back off. And when I say close I me I couldn't see the hood of his car. We were probably only a few inches apart. I was going slow because I saw a cop. I couldn't move over to the next lane either because the guy next to me would speed up or slow down as I did, which was equally as infuriating. After a solid minute that felt like forever I am able to slow down enough to move over and the Driver behind me blares in the horn flipping me off and screwing by me. The cop pulls out and pulls him over. It felt so damn good."
15,"Was planning on meeting a guy, but then he told me that I'd look cute with a dog's cock in my mouth. "
16,"* I feel less comfortable bringing my boyfriend to a gay bar, LGBT club meeting, or Pride event, but I could still do it.
* I can't really talk about girlfriends with my family. I mean, they *know*, but it's pretty obvious they don't want to hear about it. Whereas as soon as I date a guy it's all: ""What's his name? How old is he? How did you meet? Can I see a picture? What does he do?""
* With girls I don't feel 100% safe showing affection in public no matter where we are. I didn't realize this one until I dated a girl for the first time. I mean, it's totally acceptable where I live and I still do it just as much as with a guy, but I was still always hyper-aware of our surroundings when we kissed, in a way I've never been when being physically affectionate with a guy.
* Depends on the specific partner, but I suppose in general I'd be able to have a biological child with more men than women.

... That's all I can think of right now. I'm surprised I came up with so much, actually."
17,"I've posted this before, but I didn't realize the penis went *into* the vagina the way it does. I thought it slid in and out of the lips, like a hotdog in a bun. I didn't know there was depth to the vagina."
18,"With my ex from college, I realized that I would pretty much have to do all the cooking and cleaning constantly because he could never be bothered with it. Moaning and tantrums happened when I asked him to do something. And he wondered why I became cranky all the time. "
19,I'm sure this is a popular opinion; public proposals. 
20,He always notices little things that are tough for me and fixes them without me asking. For instance: I had a hard time reaching glasses in the cupboard and would just climb onto the counter to reach them. He spent an afternoon moving all the shelves down so I could reach them. Had to rearrange half the kitchen. 
21,"His libido was just through the roof! When we were only seeing each other 2 - 3 times a week, I miss him and felt very desired when he'd want to have sex with me twice at night and once more in the morning. When I realized he expects this EVERYDAY and throws tantrums when I'm not in the mood, however.... slowly every night became me trying to come up with every excuse to not have sex, and him nagging me for an hour until I finally give in and let him have some star fish sex just to shut him up... which in turn makes me want sex even less. I somehow stayed in it for another year because other reasons, but I'm so glad I finally left."
22,"I had no idea that all men's penises became erect when they were turned on. In sex ed we learned about the ""states"" that a penis can be in: flaccid and erect. However I thought that what they meant was that there were two types of penises and a man was born with either of the shapes. In my mind this had no bearing on how sex worked whatsoever, because I'd never had sex at the time of when I learned this, and none of my sex ed classes cared to explain the mechanics of sex. I had no clue that it's pretty much impossible to have sex with a completely flaccid penis. 

I actually learned the correct way a few times having sex after my first time with my highschool boyfriend. The first few times I only ever saw his penis hard, but I think something like the 4th time getting it on he kept it out after he came and I noticed that his penis became significantly smaller and softer. I was absolutely mesmerized. "
23,"i love Sansa because she's.. well, exactly what most of us would be in that situation. sure, we like to talk big game about how we'd stick up for ourselves and never be abused and emerge as badasses who reject gender roles like Arya and Brienne but.. those were the times, and Sansa exemplified how just surviving is strength in of itself."
24,That is a didgeridon't
25,"In terms of non-sexual stuff, I always felt free of gender roles with women and never had to worry about them feeling insecure. With men, they'd always butt in when it came to things like lifting shit, paying restaurant bills, dealing with car salesmen/hotel receptionists/whatever. With women I felt entirely equal, and tasks were split according to who wants to do them or who's best at them, not according to gender. 

Things I could do with boyfriends were PDA without hearing, ""Omg lesbians that's so hot is there room for one more?"" 

In terms of sexual stuff, it's like night and day. Women can and do go on forever. I didn't know I could have multiple orgasms til very late in life when I slept with a woman, and we'd have around 5 each on average every time. Penises, and the internal wiring in men that says they need to cool down and chill after an orgasm, are severely limiting. "
26,"The way he wakes me up.

He always gets up before I do, gets dressed in the dark so the light won't bother me, and then wakes me up kissing me when he's ready to leave. "
27,"He is very lazy and I knew this prior to moving into his apartment with him. But, I didn't understand just HOW lazy he can be. When he's working, he's completely different but when he doesn't have a job, he becomes very lethargic and really only gets up from his computer to pee. 

When I moved in, I made it clear that he needed to have a job within 3 months or I would move out. There were a lot of tense nights living in that apartment, but he made it clear that he didn't want to lose me over this and tried very very hard to get a job. Any job. 

He now works for my Dad and he's the happiest I've ever seen him! "
28,"It doesn't matter what other women's libidos are like.

Yours is what yours is, and you shouldn't feel guilty or compare."
29,"Dude bit my arm. 

I can elaborate if anyone is interested.

EDIT: So, I was studying in Indonesia and decided to try Tinder. The first and biggest problem was that all the hot Indonesian guys spoke limited English. After a lot of unsuccessful Google Translating back and forth, I gave up and matched with a South African guy who had a year contract in Jakarta with the World Bank.

We first met at a club in Kemang. I didn't stay long that day, but it was long enough to ascertain that this guy had some very misleading pictures. I hadn't noticed that in each of his Tinder photos, he had been strategically covering the lower half of his face (by smoking a cigarette, drawing a bow and arrow, and so on). There was definitely a reason for that. That being said, I didn't want to be shallow and he seemed normal, so I agreed to a lunch date that Friday.

On Friday, everything went sideways. First, dude kept talking about wanting to make positive changes in his life, like quitting smoking, going to the gym more, and eating salad. I asked him if there was any particular reason he was making all these changes at once - maybe a quarter life crisis? He hemmed and hawed and didn't want to tell me, but I insisted. Finally, in a very scattered and nonchronological way, dude explained that 1) he had had a long-term girlfriend, but 2) he cheated on her with a local Indonesian woman, who 3) became pregnant with his child, upon which he 4) immediately abandoned them both, until 5) the woman's father came to him begging him to not let his grandson be a bastard, which is really bad under Indonesian law, so 6) he reluctantly married this woman, and is still married to her, but 7) now that the baby was born, he wants to get a divorce, but his wife doesn't, so he is 8) *in hiding from his wife*.

This had all happened very recently. His son was born in November, and this date was in February or early March. So here's this guy who cheated on his girlfriend, abandoned his wife and his infant son, and is now in hiding from the law, trying to date on Tinder like three months later. I just started laughing because this guy's life was so terrible and it was all his fault. Also, I asked him why he cheated on his girlfriend, and he just said, ""Exoticism"" and started going on about how he had always wanted to have a Japanese wife (bad sign, since I'm Asian American). 

Based on all this, I knew we could never hook up, and told him so. Really, I should have left right then, but dude was like, ""No worries, we don't have to hook up, we can just hang out at my place with my Canadian roommate,"" and I was super dumb and naive and thought that sounded legit. So I agreed to go back to his fugitive hiding spot. 

Almost as soon as we arrived and I met his roommate, said roommate vanished to take a very long shower. So now it's just me and this stranger hanging out in his room. At this point I know what's up, so I'm sitting awkwardly in this guy's computer chair to try and create some psychological distance between us, wondering what I should do. I'm in a part of Jakarta that I don't know at all, and I don't have an Indonesian SIM card yet, so I can't easily call a taxi. Meanwhile, dude is playing some of his self-composed music and keeps getting up and leaving the room to refill his beer glass. On one of these trips, while he's out of the room, I'm thinking I should really leave, when I suddenly feel something on my arm. I look down, and this guy has quietly padded up behind me, crouched down on the floor, and bit my upper arm. In fact, he's still biting/attached to my arm, even as I'm looking down, realizing what's happening. We make uncomfortable eye contact, biter to bitee. In retrospect, I think this dude was trying to be playfully erotic, but at the moment it was just so bizarre and out of left field I burst out laughing and announced that I'm going to call a taxi and go home. The taxi to the train takes two hours because of crazy Jakarta traffic. And I've never met someone off Tinder since. "

31,"Well, have you tried it? Still feels pretty good 🙊"
32,"In my early 20's at a dive bar, near closing time. I just put money into the jukebox and was making my selections when a very large man pushed me away and fished into his pockets for money to make a selection. He realized that the machine had credits available and used them! I didn't fuss because if he was capable of shoving me for a few songs, what else was he capable of?  
Anyway, after he walked away I looked at the floor and saw that he had dropped a folded up $100 bill! I casually stepped on it, hiding it under my shoe and picked it up without suspicion... Instant payback!!!"
33,"When I went on my first field trip, at the age of 4, I got separated from my group. We were at the zoo and I was just staring at the lions too long and everyone walked off.

When I realized I was lost, I went up to a woman with dark, curly hair and a little girl about my age, and asked her for help. She took my hand and walked me to the front office, where my group was waiting. Being a tiny kid, I never even said thank you, just ran off.

10 years later, I signed up for a big school trip over spring break, from Texas to Italy. It was my first time leaving my home state, much less the country.

Italy was beautiful, but the trip was tough for me. I was the youngest person on the trip and didn't know anyone. A bunch of my classmates got in trouble for drinking and partying, but they hadn't even invited me to join them because they thought I was such a nerd, so while they were all under 24/7 chaperone supervision most of the trip I was left to wander around alone.

One day got particularly bad. I was tired, it was raining, and I didn't have an umbrella. We were supposed to be watching a leather working demonstration, but I just gave up and sat down on the floor in the entryway instead, and put my head on my knees.

After a few minutes, I heard a woman's voice asking, in accented English, ""Are you okay?"" Looked up and it was like I got hit in the face by a two by four of memories. I told her I was fine, then asked cautiously if she'd ever been to Texas. She said yes, many years ago. 

Yes, it turned out to be the same woman who found me at the zoo when I was 4, on a totally different continent 10 years later. I had thought as a kid that she was Mexican, but apparently she was actually Italian, and living in the US briefly while her husband was studying at a nearby university. "
34,"&gt;star fish sex

So, neither I nor my husband had ever heard of this until the other day. We were looking up something else on Urban Dictionary and ""star fish sex"" was like the next recommended word. We laughed for a while and I forgot about it.

The next time we had sex, I'm on top, everything's going very nicely... and he spreads his arms / legs and starts rolling his eyes around in his head. I ask him WTF he was doing.. fucking ""star fish sex"". "
35,"My experience with women is that I can be honest about how I feel about our interactions (our sex, our relationship, etc) and they won't be hurt if I say, like, 'This isn't working, maybe try this.'

My experience with men is that you can absolutely amaze them with dumb shit like basic skincare and stuff like that."
36,"The expectation that you will meet someone, fall in love, marry and have kids all by your early 30's. It's a time table! And being judged for not wanting/settling for someone just to comply with the time table can be hard."
37,"I didn't realize penetration was a thing. I thought the dude just pointed his penis and squirted the sperm into the woman from a few feet away. The mental imagery of this act is really, really hilarious though. "
38,"Skylar was my immediate thought upon reading your question. Do I *like* her? No. Do I think she reacted in a reasonable and expected way to her husband (and father of her children) becoming an evil murderous drug lord? Absolutely. And it's scary how many people seem to idolize Walter because he's a ""badass"". No. The show is about a good guy becoming a very bad guy. "
39,"A lot of guys apparently think it's romantic to keep asking someone out again and again no matter how many times they say no, I think it's incredibly disrespectful and potentially abusive and frightening."
40,"Faux helplessness, in this case in the kitchen.  I've stated before that I don't mind doing all/most of the cooking in a relationship, and that's true.  I had an SO who said about all he could do was heat shit up in the microwave, and I really didn't care.  Guy also more or less claimed he couldn't even boil water or make toast (yeah, right - this is an electrical engineer) but whatever, NOT a dealbreaker, just silliness.

Until I got a grill.  And suddenly, guess who can cook?  I was like, fuck that - you cannot get near the grill until/unless you produce something in the kitchen.  Which never happened.  

Again, not itself the dealbreaker, but the propensity toward that kind of silly, petty, ""Oh, I just *can't*"" behaviour has become a red flag."
41,Asshole cut in front of me in the check-in line at the airport claiming that I'd cut in front of him. When I'd been standing there for several minutes. And then while going through security in a hurry he dropped his laptop. 
42,"Not a character, but a character archetype -- the nagging, unpleasant wife/girlfriend who is mean specifically so the main character (a guy) can cheat and we won't be mad at him. Get Him to the Greek, 50/50, and a bunch of movies have this character and I HATE it. Also they're always completely myopic (""I know you're saving the world right now but I'm calling to berate you for not doing the shopping!""... or even ""I'm calling to berate you for something seriously important and all you're doing is have wacky adventures, but the narrative is still going to portray me as an unreasonable harpy!"") They're the tyrant princesses hollywood is so convinced are everywhere."
43,"If he wakes up to go to work before I do I always get a kiss goodbye. Even if we are in the middle of fighting.

I have a habit of making a weird squeaky noise when I want a kiss and he always complies. Sometimes I do it when he's sleeping and he will wake up half asleep eyes still closed and kiss me."
44,"Valentines Day. People can show each other how they feel the other 364 days in a year, but for some reason, this one day is the most important and heaven forbid if you skip it. Seems like one big contest to see who got the biggest bouquet delivered to their desk."
45,"When I am dating a man, I feel like I don't have to dull my sparkle on my relationship to save the feelings of others.  I don't ever feel pressure to say ""I saw a movie this weekend"" instead of ""My boyfriend and I saw a movie this weekend.""  I don't feel pressure to avoid PDA, or awkwardness booking hotel rooms.  I don't feel the need to be defensive when telling an ex that I'm dating someone new, and processing their feelings about that.

When I'm dating a woman, I don't feel the need to dull the sparkle on myself.  I dress how I like, cut my hair how I like, play the sports I like, speak the opinions I feel, and just in general *be good at the stuff I'm good at* without the fear that it's going to reflect poorly on my partner.  Even if some dude doesn't feel emasculated by me being myself (and most of them do) other people are going to think that, and that's a thing that I don't have to deal with when dating women.

Also holy shit, it's like when men have sex they forget that they have hands."
46,"Man, I hated Sansa in the first book, especially since she's kind of written as a foil for Arya who identified with and liked a lot more. But she is actually such a great character, and I began to like her more and more with each Sansa chapter in the books. "
47,I don't think he thought that far ahead.
48,"Red flag city!

Red Flag #1: As we ordered dinner, told me he was drunk.

Red Flag #2: When I asked him where he'd been drinking earlier, he told me he'd been hanging out and drinking with Sandra, his FWB. (I was hoping he'd been at one of our neighborhood fairs or a sporting event bc it was pretty early in the day.)

Red Flag #3: ""Technically, I'm still married.""

At this point, I know there is absolutely no potential relationship with this guy, but he cracked me up and I thought maybe we could be friends? So, we headed to a bar for a drink.

Red Flag #4: Turns out he had another date waiting for him at this bar.  That's right, he took me (a date) to meet up with another date.

As much fun as I'd been finding Red Flag City, I decided it was time to put myself in a cab and call it a night."
49,"I don't think I hate him, I just hate the things he did and said.

I was so in love with him, I thought he was perfect for me. This one day, we were sitting together alone and he started tearing up saying, ""I wouldn't ever want to lose you, I can't imagine being without you. Like if you found out anything, I wouldn't want to lose this."" I was confused at first *'if you found out anything'*, but I didn't want to ruin the moment so I just comforted him saying I wasn't going anywhere.

I wanted him succeed in life since his dad was abusive and sometimes he was depressed. I wanted to stick with him for a long time.

Until I found out he was cheating on me, the same month he 'teared up' about losing me. 

So now I can't trust love at all, a stupid guy can 'cry' for you and just end up cheating on you. 

EDIT: Thanks for sharing your stories :)"
50,"Martha Jones from Doctor Who. 

Dude, she saved the universe, yeah she was a tad annoying but you're coming from Rose Tyler who everyone basically loved to Martha who isn't Rose and she was everything Rose wasn't, but by God I loved her. "
51,"God was finishing up creating the universe. He had a couple of leftovers in his bag of shit, so he stopped by to visit Adam and Eve in the Garden. He told them that one of the things he had to give away was the ability to pee while standing up. ""It can be very handy, you can write your name in the snow and relieve yourself almost anywhere"" God explained to Adam and Eve. ""Who wants it?""

Adam popped a cork. He jumped up and begged, ""Oh, give that to me! It seems the sort of thing a man should be able to do. Please, Lord, let me have that ability. I would be forever grateful.""

Eve thought that would be fun, but Adam obviously was crazy to have it so she told God that if Adam really wanted it so badly, then she really wouldn't mind if he were the one given the ability to urinate while standing up.

Then, He looked back into his bag of leftover gifts. ""Now, what have we here? Oh, yes, multiple orgasms..."""
52,"Haaaaaaate it. It's so fucking condescending. Sure, have color options, great. But Jesus christ we get it, we have vaginas, just give me the damn drill. 

Edit: also, can I get some goddamn work gloves in a small size please? I go to Lowe's and I can find men's work gloves and kids work gloves but the only gloves for women are gardening gloves. I'd wager more women need Mechanix gloves than kids do..."
53,Is it taboo to say a vibrator? Nobody has mentioned it yet. I have a healthy sex life with my fiance but still... not sure why I waited so long!
54,"He'll randomly stop in the middle of what he's doing and come snuggle me for a few minutes, then resume what he was doing. 

There's also a few little things, like picking something small up from the store that he knows/thinks I might like. "
55,"I stopped for a red light, albeit a bit short, but the driver behind me didn't like that and blared their horn loudly as they went around me, running the red light.  Immediately a cop that was on the green light side of that intersection put on their lights and pulled the car right over.  I beeped a friendly toot! as I drove by. "
56,"Diamonds as engagement presents, especially the idea that you must spend a month's salary or some such nonsense on it.  Most over-priced rock on the planet with artificial scarcity (they're really not rare)."
57,"Well, I thought my libido was extremely low/non-existing, then I gave up hormonal BC and was like ""_Oh_"". After years and years of not really being interested in sex, my libido has returned (?).  


Before, I felt like sex was a chore, boring, not worth it. Being in a relationship, it goes without saying, that feeling that way was awful. "
58,"My ex did the same. His excuse was that he was never taught how, his parents just always did it for him. He'd say he wanted to learn, but never showed it. Moaning and tantrums, as you said. He was shocked whenever I'd tell him that I need his help in keeping the place clean, get mad at him about it, or say things like ""I'm not a fucking housewife!"" So shocked. Went on for MONTHS. When I finally broke up with him he said the breakup came out of nowhere, he wasn't expecting it at all. Wow, really? Open your fucking eyes."
59,"I grew up spending my summers in a small beach town. Another kid in my town was a bit of a bully. He spent an entire summer throwing jellyfish at people and rubbing them on seats so that people that sat down would get stung on their butts. After a whole summer of terrorizing others, he jumped off a raft in the water and a jellyfish made its way into his swim trunks. It was such sweet karma!"
60,"Because I had a very limited sex ed, the emphasis was just on sperm meeting egg, so semen was kinda overlooked. I thought that, since sperm were too small to see, the male orgasm was just like a fart. "
61,"30 minutes into our date he decided to invite his live-in girlfriend to join us. She knew he dated other people, but I didn't know he had a girlfriend. 

I stuck around in horrified fascination long enough to learn he'd met her online as well, but she'd lived in another state, and he'd paid to move her from there into his place, where it seemed she was now basically trapped - allowed to go to school and the gym but forbidden from holding a job and separated from all her friends and family. 

Then he told me that in his opinion, if my relationship with him moved forward, I would also move in with them in the next few months and have a similar life to her - the gym, some classes at a local college, and the house only. 

I actually did not storm out immediately because it was so obvious this poor girl was super isolated and really hoping for what she seemed to think of as a live-in BFF to give her someone else to hang out with and a buffer between her and her ""boyfriend"", and I felt really bad for her. I hope she got out and is doing okay now."
62,"This isn't a huge deal, really, but Facebook relationship status changes.  I have a cousin who is in a relationship, and then not, several times a month.    "
63,"Rachel from Friends. I didn't even know some people hated her until Reddit. She took some stupid decisions and did annoying things on the show sometimes, but every character on the show did them, only Rachel gets that level of hate. I wonder if it's because she was portrayed as the more fortunate character."
64,"Awful at life. He acted confident and had a great job and owned a home at 30, I thought wow this is great! 

Turns out he blew through 40k(from his house sale with his ex wife) in 4 months on beer and girls at the bar, bought a car at 18% interest because the girl he liked thought Jeeps were hot and he bought the car dead drunk and over all was a huge man child that thought I was his mommy.

I left. He moved back in with mommy."
65,The guy I'm currently seeing once told me I was dangerous. I really liked that. 
66,My ex stole my cat. I absolutely hate him for it. 
67,I found a $100 bill in the parking lot of a store once. It wasn't the best neighborhood so I thought it was either drug money or meant to pay someone's bills. I left my email address with the store and told them that I found some money (didn't specify how much) and if someone asked about it they could email me. A few hours later I got an email from a woman asking me if I had found a $100 bill. I met her at her workplace (a daycare) and she wept when she got the money back because her daughter was in the hospital and she had borrowed the money from a friend to help pay for things.

71,"Old men whose wives have died. But not old women whose husbands have died. (Being heteronormative on purpose here, because I think it's relevant). 

Idk, I think it's just because all of the elderly ladies in my extended family have been great at carrying on their lives after their husbands died but the men... Not so much. They're just all sad and helpless and can't deal with themselves because their wives did everything for them for like 50 years."
72,"There's this moment in 500 Days of Summer where the little sister challenges JGL to look at his relationship again and rewinds back to all of these memories of his that were beautiful and it shows Summer's obvious disinterest or unhappiness in the relationship. 

After every breakup, you're going to remember the good things and you just have to be really honest with yourself, why did you think breaking up with them was good to do at the time? If it was because it got a little hard then that's one thing, but if it's because they were too controlling or mean or condescending or whatever else the reason might be, then you have to surface those things up. 

It's really difficult to do at first, but try to make an honest list of what about the relationship was worth while and what about the relationship was not - and if I were you, I'd start with the latter to remember more clearly why this person wasn't right for you. 

Best of luck, friend, this part is never easy. "
73,"Do you know why women can't park? 

Because men are always lying about what 8 inches looks like.

74,"Be beautiful but if you spend too much time/money on your appearance you're shallow.

Have kids but if you want a spouse who can support a family you're a gold digger.

Be thin and in shape but if you won't date a fat or short guy you're shallow and snobby.

Be flirty, available and friendly, but if you are with the wrong people or with too many you're a slut.

You can be smart and successful but if you try to get a word into a conversation you're too emotional.

Be available to hang out with your boyfriend but if you text him too much you're clingy.

Stand up for yourself but if it inconveniences soneone you're a ""word not allowed on this sub.""

There are a comically depressing number of contradictions fed to women our whole lives. Men hear their own versions as well. Gender norms and expectations in general just really suck."

76,"I'm not *very* financially successful, I'm still solidly 99%, but I own a home, work a job I like, and don't ever worry about paying bills.  Read on if you're interested in being happy and having enough money to do stuff you like but probably not being super rich!

The biggest piece of advice I'd give to anyone is to decide what to study based on what you want to do for a living, rather than the other way around.  Your job is something you'll have to do for 8 hours a day for the rest of your life, and your education will be the most expensive thing you ever buy.  And the thing that makes your job enjoyable, or even tolerable, isn't the topic it's in.  It's the tasks you do.  The kind of person who enjoys solving puzzles will probably be equally happy troubleshooting rockets or toasters.  But no matter how much they love space, they'd probably be deeply unhappy as a tour guide of a space museum, or writing NASA press releases after the first week.

So the more you can do to research jobs that you might be interested in, what daily life is like in those jobs, how hard it is to get those jobs, what education you need for those jobs, back up plans in case you don't like it, and then find out the best way for you to get that education, the more likely that you'll end up prepared for a job that will make you happy.

And also, you are allowed to get a job that doesn't make you happy!  You can get a job that is satisfying and tolerable with pleasant hours and benefits, to give you the money you need to dedicate the rest of your life to all the things that do make you happy.

For myself, I went into college wanting to be a lawyer, but knowing that law school was expensive, and you can do basically anything undergrad.  I also knew that you can get a job with a bachelors in a scientific field that is likely to pay for law school.  So I took a Physics scholarship, but when I realized I didn't like Physics, I switched to Comp Sci.  Graduated with a BA in CS, started working as a Software Developer with the intention of saving/using workplace education subsidies to go to law school, and liked my job so much that I never wanted to.

Now I work as a Software Engineer at a small startup and I love it."
77,"I don't hate him, but I'd love to punch him in the mouth. 

He wasted five years of my time, never genuinely cared about me, and when he dumped me (sporting a hickey and smelling like her shampoo), he told me he'd lied every time he ever said he ""loved"" me. 

I was just a stand-in for his ex. They dated for *eight months* and even after several years, he couldn't remember my birthday (but he'd remember hers) and called me by her name in his sleep more than once. 

Turns out, he'd been cheating on me with her for four of the five years we were together. Everything I'd thought we'd ever had, every inside joke, every new adventure, every special thing he did for me... It had nothing to do with me at all. He wanted me to be her. Five years. Wasted. I never meant a goddamn thing to him. 

I don't hate him but if he makes a pass at me while he's here next week, I'm going to make him truly wish he'd never even seen my face. 

**Edit:** I can't believe I forgot about this! So. He left his two cats with me when he moved out of state. Promised me vaccines and a standard de-worming would be taken care of, and the female (Hades) would be spayed, before coming to live with me. 

That did not happen. He dropped them off with some supplies and bounced. Never offered to pitch in on a single vet bill. Did not get their drontal squared away, and the bigger one (Loki) vomited roundworms all over my kitchen table. I went the fuck off. 

When they lived with him and I'd come over for some stuff after we broke up, I was so sad for the animals. Litter box so gross there were dried out cat turds in the bathroom floor, no toys, pieces of shredded cardboard all over, smoking inside around them. Loki likes to drink from the bathtub, and there was a fucking purple ring around his. I cried so many times because I couldn't take them while they were chipped to him. Ughhhhhhh. 

**Another edit:** [pictures!](https://imgur.com/a/VDb9o) Hades is the gray one, Loki has stripes. "
78,Every year on our anniversary my husband and I exchange keychains with each other. It might sound silly but they actually get used and don't cost so much that if we lost them it would devastate us. The one I got him this year is a swiss army knife with his name engraved. The one he gave me is a turtle carved from Amethyst. We keep all the old ones in a big shoebox so that if we lose the one we were given this year we can just use an old one. We also put a little tag on each saying what year they were given. We like our system :)
79,"Catelyn Tully/Stark. 

People forget that she is a mother who loses every child she has and her husband. She loses everything she loves very slowly and painfully. Her son ignores her best advice and she has been unfairly vilified by all kinds of fans.

82,A dirty reusable cum towel. Jesus 
83,"He was a lazy piece of sh*t, basically a child, and completely irresponsible with money. He would spend money from our joint account that was strictly for bills on toys. Not like ""adult"" toys, but he would honestly, as a 20-something go to toy's r us and buy CHILDREN'S TOYS. TO PLAY WITH. He would also never clean up after himself... I would find said toys all over the house, dishes in the sink, towels/clothes on the floor when I got home from very long shifts. He worked part-time at Target while I was the breadwinner and literally didn't do anything at home except play video games and dick around. 

I put up with it for a couple of years to try to ""teach"" him before I realized it wasn't my job to be his mother. 

Also the sex was awful. Obviously we are no longer together. "
84,"Mine is average I guess. 

I masturbate, but that's separate from the drive to actually have sex, which when I'm single is pretty much zero. But when I'm seeing someone I'm attracted to and comfortable with, the desire for sex is high and frequent."
85,"As a female, I don't have multiple orgasms and no desire to keep going after I have one. It becomes painful and uncomfortable to be touched afterwards and I have 0 interest in anything sexual for like weeks to months after I have one. So, not true for all women."

88,"Teenage girl was shitty to me at my job, really really rude and I'll behaved. About 10mins after she left I noticed a wallet left behind. I opened it to look for ID to contact the owner as was the store policy, and it was hers. And she had a fake ID in it. I laughed and figured I'd call the house next day if she didn't come back.

Well, she came back with her dad in tow talking about how she should be more responsible with her belongings and how we better have his baby's wallet. I could see the panic in her eyes when I opened it and asked if I could have the name of the owner to verify it from the ID. He told me and I grabbed the fake and smiled at her while I said ""oh. That's not the name on this card. Here sir, is this correct?""

Never seen a dad drag a brat out of the store faster or harder.

Fuck you, Caroline. I WIN."
89,"I love it, but I'm still not used to it. I had my daughter when I was 17 and never ever expected to NOT struggle financially. I grew up on food stamps and donations from the church, so not stressing about how to afford groceries is a huge shift. I don't know if I'll ever get used to it. "

This kind of age gap power-trip he pulls is so calculated and he's had all this time to perfect his method, she stood no chance. A lot of us (people) have had that one really long, stupid, lack of judgement moment. Throw in the high stakes, the thrill, that dumb baseball pitcher says all these weird things to convince her how wonderful it is that Edward found her, ""the asshole that only *I* can tame"" bullshit... she's trapped. Girl has issues. Some old man making her feel protected and invincible sounds really tempted to a teenager. But do I hate her? Yeah I kinda do. Just because."

97,"""and was too stubborn to learn""

This part would be such a bigger problem to me than the basic ignorance. Not everyone has someone to teach them, and it's easy to be intimidated by banks and all that, but to not even be willing to try and learn would be a total deal breaker."
98,"Had a friend borrow my car, it was parked in the parking lot at her work when another car jumped the curb and slammed into it, totalling my car. My 'friend' somehow got the persons insurance company to make out the check to her and she used the funds to buy herself a new car. Leaving me without a car or financial compensation for it. She then proceeded to let my totalled car sit on the street until the city towed it, the city sent me a bill for $250, since I was the owner. Infuriating.
Edit: to clarify, it was an old POS, worth maybe $1000, and it was a long process, it was maybe 6 weeks from the date of the accident until she got a check and bought a new car. She was already distancing herself, just telling me she was handling it, another 4 months or so until I got a bill from the city. I assumed that the other drivers insurance company didn't put up too much of a fight due to the obvious responsibility of their driver and the low dollar amount."
99,Omg how the hell do you not have a bank account?! How does he... Oh man. Good thing you got out.
100,When I was in high school my parent went through a divorce. They were married for 23 years and I was the only kid left at home. It was hard for me. I went to my locker at school one day and there were two notes from my best friends at the time explaining to me that they didn't want to be my friend anymore because all I did was talk about the divorce and how sad I was about it.
101,"I developed a few habits that have made a really big impact on my life:

- Exercise. I started weightlifting because I wanted a place to run away to for some ""me"" time. Terry Crews said to make the gym like your spa - go there to rejuvenate and do something good for your body. Strength training is really centering, because you're working your brain and body: you practice focus and release endorphins, while developing discipline and positive changes to your body. All good things.

- Fresh air. Go outside more. Getting some sun, and being near some greenery is important. A walk outside never fails to make me feel good. I love to listen to happy music while I get out, and Spotify has a great selection of playlists and moods. I walk to the gym to maximize my exercise and to really feel good, but I also like to get out and play some Pokemon go too.

- Meditation and mindfulness. I tend to worry about the future and things outside of my control. So I take a minute to sit and just *breathe*, and really take in just sensing with my body right now, in this very moment. Right now is all I have and can control, so it's important to ground myself where I am so I can get where I want tomorrow.

- Clean. Visual clutter is emotional clutter. Take 5 or 10 minutes to do a chore or tidy up your immediate surroundings. A clean and tidy space is a worry free space. It takes away a lot of background stress."

107,"I was waiting at a particularly annoying light (admittedly, one I have jaywalked a hundred times) with several other pedestrians on the way to work when a bicyclist blew by, nearly getting hit by a car who had the green light.

108,The woman taking her husband's last name.
109,"I thought most people hated her because the ""blank slate"" character is a lazy way of writing."

113,"Literally ""fake it till I make it."" At my job, once I got more comfortable with some of my coworkers, I started joking around when they'd say something like ""You did a good job on this"" by saying ""YEAH BECAUSE I'M A GENIUS."" Or when they say ""Who can do this for me?"" and I say ""ME BECAUSE I'M THE BEST THERE EVER WAS."" It's obviously completely a joke, and nobody thinks I'm serious... but about a year later I weirdly discovered that I actually *did* feel more confident in my work. Perhaps it wasn't the jokes themselves that made me feel more confident... perhaps it was the fact that the time I spent making them was time I *didn't* spend discounting my own accomplishments or doubting myself. The time I spent jokingly saying ""BECAUSE I'M A GENIUS"" *wasn't* time I spent saying ""No, it wasn't *really* that good, I could've done [X] or [Y] better...""

I also sort of like to refer to myself as an ""unreliable narrator"" when it comes to myself. I try to remember that I am far more critical of myself, and far more quick to discount my own accomplishments and focus on my failures, than others are when they consider me. I try to remember friends and coworkers who capable and accomplished, and yet constantly beat themselves up and doubt themselves, and realize I'm doing the same thing to myself. I then try to view the comments, observations, compliments, and criticisms I receive from others the way I would think of them if they were being given to someone else. It helps me separate any legitimate doubts over the comment-giver's reliability or intentions from my own flawed self-image by making it not about *me.* If I find the person totally on target in their compliments/criticisms of others, I'm going to accept them at their word about me. If someone is an absolute bullshitter, I'm going to take their comments about me with a grain of salt without it becoming about my own self doubt."

Today I was sitting on the floor with three kids. A 10 month old, a 13 month old and a 15 month old. They were happily playing. The 10 month old was looking at me and we were interacting. Suddenly he sneezed. Kids that age respond well to grown-ups mirroring them, so I went ""achoo!"". He completely lost his shit laughing at my fake sneeze so I repeated it a few times. He could not stop laughing. 

It occurred to me that one day he's going to be grown up. He's going to deal with bills and heartache and loneliness and loss and as an adult, it's going to be so hard to find joy as pure as the joy he was feeling when he just thought it was hilarious that I sneezed. And that makes me sad. "
121,"I had no idea the size and shape of penises until I saw one on the guy I was with in high school. My mom instilled a fear of them in me by telling me they were scary and gross.

127,"I'm a secondary school teacher in the UK and my experience of homeschooled kids who turn up in my classroom is that they are socially stunted and academically far behind their peers.

132,"The worst was:

Guy catfished me (super old profile pic). He was dressed horribly and was about 100 pounds heavier than the pic he had. The entire time he complained about his mother (he was mid-late 20s) and his cat. He then started to get a bit creepy and told me that when he likes a girl, he likes to envision what the first dance at our wedding would be. Mine was ""I'll Stand By You"" by the Pretenders.

Refused to let him pay for my dinner, or kiss me at my car. "

I remember my boyfriend mentioned that he was shocked that I barely reacted when he first made me scrambled eggs and toast, apparently in the past he actually had to make a point of not cooking for girls too early on because they would see it as a sign that he must be in love with him. This is how common men not willing to cook is!

He came home and asked for a divorce.  I sat down slowly and looked him dead in the eyes and said, ""You want to go.  I understand that.  Go.  I'll be here when you get back.""   He sobbed for hours after that.  He felt if he divorced me, he wouldn't have to leave me worrying about him.  Yes it sounds messed up and he even says now it was a stupid thought on his part.  

And yes, I did wait and he came home. "
146,"She told our class I'd been raped so the boy we both had a crush on wouldn't like me.

We were in grade school and both liked the same boy. She decided to announce to everyone in the middle of class that I'd been raped, to make me less desirable.  Of course, it was right in front of him and the two girls who had bullied me. I was furious! I yelled at her, so our teacher got mad at me, then I walked out of class which got me in even more trouble. 

And oh, yeah, I'd never been raped. I had, however, been repeatedly sexually assulted which she knew. I was never able to forgive her for using that against me."

162,"Decided to meet up with guy who had no profile picture. He didn't drive so I go to pick him up. I can't really judge him on that cause I'm borrowing my parent's car. So he's waiting for me dressed in rubber boots, cargo shorts, and a rain coat (it was rather rainy). This guy must have been pushing 300lbs around 6ft. So he gets in the car and we say hello and comment about the weather as I drive off to the movie theatre. The conversation becomes focused around my clothes, hair, and sexual preferences. I try to laugh it off giving generic answers and move the conversation to something else like music and what movie he wanted to see. But he keeps bringing it back. Asking questions like:

 ""Do you always wear your hair like that?""

""Are those the type of clothes you usually wear?"" 

""How big are your breasts?"" 

""What are you like in the bedroom?"" 

""Am I making you nervous? I shouldn't, you're really pretty""


I didn't know what to say or do, as he's asking and talking about this shit I'm just thinking of a way to get out of this date but he's making me so uncomfortable I can't really think of a way. So we arrive at the theatre walking to the doors he tries to hold my hand and I just can't let him do that so I avoid touching his hand. We're about to buy tickets when he mentions he only brought enough money to buy his. I think to myself this is my chance. I tell him I left my wallet in the car and I'll go and get it. I leave the theatre and I can hear him walking after me I tell him I'm just getting my wallet but I'm sure we both know what I'm really doing. He shouts after me that he can buy my ticket, I tell him that's alright I'll just get my wallet. 

I get in my car and leave, fucking so relieved to be out of that whole situation. I feel bad for leaving him there so far from where I picked him up, I should have kicked him out of the car when he was being so rude. "
163,"I'm probably alone in this but I find almost everything about (traditional) weddings really unromantic and generally unappealing. The man asking permission from her father, the man proposing publicly or otherwise, being 'given away', all the men with major roles doing speeches. Ugh, it just smacks of the history of marriage as an institution where women are essentially property being passed between men."
164,"&gt;And also, you are allowed to get a job that doesn't make you happy!  You can get a job that is satisfying and tolerable with pleasant hours and benefits, to give you the money you need to dedicate the rest of your life to all the things that do make you happy.

THIS. I am not one of those people who will crow about my job and how great it is and how much I love my work. I don't hate my work, but I'm not passionate about it and there are way more interesting things in my life. I don't wake up every morning excited to go to the office. But they pay me well, the hours are stellar, and I get 6 weeks off per year. My job is what *enables* me to pursue my passions, like travelling or gardening or refinishing furniture or writing or taking care of my pets. I have so many more hobbies and interests now that I have the time and money to do them. I wish we'd stop pushing on people that they have to love their careers. It's great if you do but your life won't be wasted if you choose something practical that gives you the freedom to chase your interests.

165,"This is the real correct answer regarding Sansa.  In the beginning she is a whiny,cliche, helpless, princess character.  That's boring, to say the least, and annoying and distracting as well. But as the books go on and she has to grow... she gets a compelling story.  Easy to hate early on, almost impossible not to respect and enjoy as the story progresses through the novels.  "
166,"One of my favourite things is how comfortable girls are with each other physically and how we're free to show affection. For example, just a week ago I was relaxing in between my classes when two girls see each other and immediately run up to each other and hold hands for a bit. Then I heard one girl really excitedly go ""I want to tell you about my date!"" and it was just so cute."
167,She's gained popularity in the last few seasons but even that's bullshit. She was always a good character. In the beginning people hated her because she was a typical girly girl and they hated her because she responded to the drama around her by just trying to survive. People hated her because she was a female character who refused to fall into that 'I'm not like other girls' stereotype which is apparently the only way a female character can be liked.
168,"We adopted because of infertility. We wanted the newborn experience, so we chose to go through an agency and do a private adoption.  We brought both of our kids home from the hospital as soon as they were discharged after birth.  

Biggest challenges, cost and patience.  If you are in the US, there is a great tax credit for adoption, where you get back a good portion of the amount spent.  I think it is like $13,000 now (my kids are school-aged now) and we probably spent an additional $10,000 that was not covered by the tax credit.

The waiting is often not as bad as popular culture would have you believe.  My husband and I are both white and our kids are biracial (AA/Cauc) and because not all adopting families are interested in adopting from all races, being open to other races can be an advantage.  Also, things happen faster for those who are more comfortable with things like prenatal drug exposure.  

With my son, we were active with the agency, meaning paperwork and fees completed and our profile was ready to go out to birthmoms, for less than a day before we were chosen to be his parents.  He was born just 9 days later.

When we decided to adopt again, we brought home a baby girl after approximately 3 months of waiting.  This ended up being a failed adoption because the baby's father did not consent.  It was a pretty harrowing experience, and our agency was protective of us after that, only showing our profile to cases with low legal risk.  

Following that, five months later we were matched with my daughter's birthmom, and she was born two months after that.

I am happy to answer any specific questions if anyone has them."
169,"I don't love the phrase, but am also not hugely offended by it. Most of my friends and I are in our mid to late 20's. We are infinity-scarf-wearing, Starbucks-drinking, top-knot-sporting caricatures of women who share far too much of our lives on instragram. So, when we heard through a friend that we were being called *basic*, we really weren't all that surprised or offended. I just really do love pumpkin spice, and I don't feel any need to apologize for it."

171,"I just saw Forrest Gump for the first time about a week ago, and I had no idea people hated Jenny. Even if you don't completely comprehend all the nuances of Jenny's character, it's pretty obvious she's going through some pretty major shit on her own, and she wants to keep Forrest separate from that. How can you hate her for that?"
172,"That's amazing, congratulations!!

It's not that exciting because I'm pretty sure she was mostly joking, but today my new manager told me that I'm her ""protégé.""

I am mostly excited about it because I've only been there a month, and at my last job I got zero acknowledgment for anything I did. It's so nice to feel appreciated and valued!"
173,"I remember getting in arguments with my friends about which Stark sister was a better character, I got so much shit for being team Sansa. Call me an elitist, but it really bothers me how many show watchers only enjoy this story like it's a WWE match. They only like Arya because she's 'cool' and 'badass' and 'totally not a horrifically tragic and misguided perversion of some childish revenge fantasy'. Sansa is a much more humble and down-to-earth portrayal of a teenage girl, it's definitely the most mature take on femininity in the story and I find it to be a lot more nuanced and interesting than nearly anyone gives it credit for. 

I think the Sansa vs Arya question is the most fundamental barometer of why you enjoy the story. I find Arya's story to be a kind of ridiculous over the top cool-factor fantasy ninja nonsense, while Sansa actually interests me quite a great deal. But since she can't ""play the game ooo"" (Which is a show invention, the 'game' of medieval politicking is never described with any such fetishization in the books) she gets looked over because she's not particularly good at politics like the Tyrell women, or fighting like Brienne and doesn't have any magical abilities like Arya or what the fuck ever would be more compelling for those that only watch this show like it's some kind of shonen anime. I like that stuff too, but the fact that it's coupled with this spectacularly deep and mature narrative is why it's so great, and Sansa represents the latter more than the former."
174,I like how he rolled his eyes. Like it was a trivial misunderstanding over something super stupid. Oh and how the courts put him in jail has no bearing on the truth either. 
175,The odds of that are one in a brazillion!
176,"Yeah, it did! I actually left the country for two years for a job and he came with me. He had a shitty little job there but it helped pay the bills. When we got back home, he took my Dad up on a job offer right away. I guess he loved me enough to get his shit together. "
177,"Stop feeling guilty. Everyone's is different, and mine varies like crazy. Assuming you're in a relationship, your partner shouldn't make you feel bad about it, either, they should be supportive and understanding.

Sometimes mine is so high. Super high. TOO high. Sometimes it literally feels like I don't have one at all, and it could be that way for weeks at a time.

I get that it's kind of scary having a low libido. I'm on a low dose of Zoloft and I think I need to increase it, but I'm terrified of losing my libido, which is especially important to me because I'm in a long-distance relationship. I've talked it over with my SO. He is supportive and understanding and we will get through it if my libido decreases/disappears, especially because I really need the SSRIs to function like a normal human being

I think in a relationship it's a little harder, because on one hand it's not necessarily fair to deprive your SO of all sex, and on the other hand it's not fair to expect you to have sex when you genuinely don't want to. Relationships are about working through the hard things together, though, so you need to have an honest talk with your partner about either how to compromise or how to work around it. It might help with your guilt, too, instead of just dwelling on it and feeling bad"

180,"I met a guy online in the early 00's. He seemed nice enough so we met for dinner. Later he asked if I wanted to check out where he works (father owned the business). It looked like a small office but then opened up into a huge warehouse filled with linens, mattresses and pillows. He offered me a pillow which I refused multiple times until finally just accepting so I could get out of there. He started emailing me multiple times a day (always mentioning the pillow) for at least a week until I told him I was no longer interested because of the intense and constant emails. His last email basically stated the least I could do was see him again or else I was using him for free pillows. I had paid for dinner. It was weird."
181,Yeah.. my boyfriend has one of those from a previous marriage. I fucking hate it more than anything in the world.
182,"He seemed fine up to that point too, which was a shame. I was looking for a Dom and I thought he was perfect, then we started talking about my limits (animals are one of them) and he came out with that line. "
183,"Scenes in movies where an animal loves and trusts a person, but is in danger so the person has to shoo them away or set them free and the animal is like ""but we're friends"" and can't understand why the person doesn't like them anymore. This situation may have happened in Dances with Wolves or maybe I just constructed that in my mind. Also it happened in Air Bud. "
184,"A parking spot. I live in LA.

I've had a few things in my life go sour, this just guarantees one less HUGE stress on my plate."
185,"When I first realized I was in love with my boyfriend, it was just something I *knew*. There was no rhyme or reason to it. I just knew. I felt it in my heart. I felt it in my bones. It was a sudden fact to me. I love him.

That's the passionate, romantic kind of love. But there's another kind of love I feel for him now that we have been together longer, been through more together, spent a lot of time together, and truly gotten to know each other. A practical love, a companionship, a partnership. 

We want the same things in life. We work together as a team to achieve goals and work towards our dreams. We support each other and advise each other and we're always there for each other. We feel each other's sadness and happiness. We have fun together. We support each other's individuality and encourage each other to do what makes us happy. 

We love each other through thick and thin, in good times and bad. Even when we argue, even when things are stressful, even when we're upset, even when we're sick or broke or struggling... I never question my love for him and I never question whether I want to be with him. When I think of our future together, I don't only fantasize about the good. I think about how well we work together through the bad. I think about how strong we are, how solid our foundation is. He is my love and he is my partner and I want to go through life with him by my side. I want to experience the good and the bad with him. 

I love him in the butterflies, dizzy kisses, dancing in the kitchen, running through the rain kind of way. But I also love him when we're figuring out problems, planning our future, going through struggles, and openly sharing our lives."
186,The last thing I bought that made me beyond happy was new bedding. The last bedspread I bought wasn't that great. I spent 3 hours at 6 different stories analyzing different bedding to find the right one. I was determined to get it right this time. I even spent a little extra on sheets. Best decision ever. 
187,"Yeah, but I blame Ned equally for her treatment of Jon. He didn't tell her the truth. He didn't even come up with a less hurtful lie. I mean, I get that he had to keep Jon's parentage secret for Jon's own safety and he said he was his son because he wanted him to have some semblance of a noble upbringing, but if there's anyone he should have been able to trust, it was Catelyn.

Also, Catelyn recognizes this as a terrible flaw of hers. She knows it's awful, but it's something she can't surmount despite trying. So, while I agree it's not right that she treated Jon the way she did, I think she remains a sympathetic character.

As she's making a prayer wheel for Bran, she says:

&gt; Catelyn Stark: After a fashion. I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall. Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox. Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he'd live. But it would be a very long night. So I sat with him all through the darkness, listened to his ragged little breaths, his coughing, his whimpering. 

&gt; Talisa Maegyr: Which boy? 

&gt; Catelyn Stark: Jon Snow. When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him, didn't want to see those brown stranger's eyes staring at me. So I prayed to the gods ""Take him away, make him die"". He got the pox and I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived. A murderer. I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother, a woman he didn't even know! So I prayed to all Seven Gods ""Let the boy live. Let him live and I'll love him. I'll be a mother to him. I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us"". 

&gt; Talisa Maegyr: And he lived? 

&gt; Catelyn Stark: And he lived. And I couldn't keep my promise. And everything that's happened since then, all this horror that's come to my family... it's all because I couldn't love a motherless child. "

189,"When I'm PMS-ing, he makes an active effort to be nicer to me, because, as he says, I can't help it if my brain is punishing me for not getting pregnant. This week, he asked me ""how's the uterus"" every day. When I said it was cramping, he would kiss my stomach and ask if it was better.

He also gives me his second piece of toast when I finish both of mine before the eggs are done cooking. It's true love."
190,I take out the dead bodies twice a week. Having a door to the garage is incredibly handy for privacy.
191,"Idk probably literally sweeping another girl off her feet to have sex with her in our bed in front of me sealed the deal. Yes, we were all drunk. No, I didn't try to stop him; I just cried. No, clearly not over it. 

Edit: I should have clarified that I was crying as he physically picked her up. That he didn't notice my (pretty ugly and loud) sobbing was indication enough he didn't care about my feelings. "
192,"I personally find public proposals obnoxious and would much rather have this special moment be something that I share with only my fiancé, not a bunch of strangers or the internet.

Plus if it's an unexpected proposal where the couple hasn't talked about marriage seriously before, I feel like the person being proposed to feels pressured to say yes because onlookers are cheering, clapping, and recording videos. That's uncomfortable."
193,"""Women think differently than men. Women shouldn't be in combat units because they'd have to learn tactics and strategy.""

Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize that when you get a penis, you're instantly endowed with Sun Tzu's wisdom whereas ovaries gotta study it. Did you know infantry men are apparently never instructed in tactics? Nope, they all know, down deep in their souls. "
194,"The guy who wouldn't get off the bar stool.

He had a work dinner to go to afterwards, so we met up at my local bar early.  He whined about how he wasn't sure he'd recognize me.  I told him that at that time, there would be two women in the bar - the bartender, and me.  I walked in and .... I was totally right.  He was on a bar stool and said to me, ""Oh, you ARE as tall as you said in your profile."" (Wtf? Do most women lie about their height? And make themselves taller?)  When it came time for him to leave to make his dinner, he just looked at me for a very long time.  I wanted to stay and chat with the bartender, and I realized he didn't want to hop off of the barstool while I was there.  I faked ""going to the bathroom"" so we could do an awkward handshake and he could leave while I was ""in the bathroom.""  Bartender and I laughed about it after he left.

Um, he asked me out again.  Did he think we'd never stand next to each other?"
195,"gf: the sex ends when both have had enough orgasms/are completely spent

bf: the sex ends when he orgasms once

obviously generalizing, not all men not all women etc."
196,"&gt; With girls I don't feel 100% safe showing affection in public no matter where we are. I didn't realize this one until I dated a girl for the first time. I mean, it's totally acceptable where I live and I still do it just as much as with a guy, but I was still always hyper-aware of our surroundings when we kissed, in a way I've never been when being physically affectionate with a guy.

Omg I can relate to this. I'm not much for PDA anyway, but I almost feel wrong showing PDA with my boyfriend because I know I couldn't do it with a girl, and it doesn't seem fair."
197,"I am happy and I enjoy my life.

I am single with no kids, so while all my money is spent on me, I pay the extra to live alone in a nice inner city area as I don't want to share house anymore. 

I go on international holidays every year or so, but other than that I avoid being frivolous with my money.

202,"I loved Martha when she was doing her thing and not fawning over the Doctor. She could have been awesome, but the writers fucked up having her crush on the Doctor while the Rose wound was still fresh. "
203,"Natasha has only had one romance in the MCU. She does not get a ""new romance in each film she appears."" I don't mean to be rude but you're doing the same thing misogynistic fanboys do: you're sexualizing her every action just because she happens to be an attractive woman. Has she been sexualized in the MCU? Yes. But it's clear that she has not been given multiple love interests and I don't know why you would think that.

Iron Man 2—Tony flirts with her and she accepts it in good-nature as a way to keep up her cover. The second she reveals who she truly is, you know that she wouldn't be allowing Tony to flirt with her. No romance with Tony.

The Avengers—Clint Barton is her best friend. That's it. No romance with Clint.

Cap 2—she kisses Steve as a way to hide from the bad guys and you know what? She's damn smart to do so. She's right, PDA makes people look away. No romance with Steve.

Age of Ultron—Romance with Bruce Banner.

Civil War—No romance with anyone. She's diplomatic towards T'Challa, friends with Clint, and friends with all the male Avengers. She's friends with everyone! 

If you watch the MCU with clear eyes, it's apparent that Natasha's only had one real love interest. Steve's had two so far. Bruce has had two so far. Thor will have had two when Thor 3 comes out. Tony's had one but he's flirted and slept with many women. These four men all have more romance than Natasha does. 

I also take issue with you saying she's only been an accessory to the guys. Sure, she has not been given nearly enough screentime—but she's had her own stories. Her tricking Loki? Her issues with trust and friendship in Cap 2? I'm sorry, but she is her own woman. Not treated the way she should be by Marvel Studios but she is a compelling and interesting character. She's not just a pawn and even if you're trying to defend her, you're doing her character—and what she means to girls all over the world—a HUGE disservice by calling her a pawn (a.k.a a prop) who only exists for the men and just has romance 24/7. That's not true. She deserves wayyyyy better from Marvel Studios—but she's also way more than you're calling her.

204,"Clever is one I particularly like although it's rare to hear - people don't say clever when they mean clever, they say bright or smart or intelligent but I like the word clever because it implies cunning and thinking on your toes instead of just smarts. Also compliments about things I did to my appearance, like doing a good job on makeup/hair/nails/outfit choices make me happy. So stylish would be a good compliment as well."
205,I think the problem in OP's situation was that he got upset when she didn't want to have sex. As long as you understand that you and your partner's libidos aren't exactly the same and you're respectful of when they're not in the mood then it usually isn't an issue :)

214,"This is purely based on my experience, so it's by no means across-the-board advice.

I broke up with my boyfriend of three months because he was way more committed than me. I wanted to take it slowly--he was already in love and wanted to marry me. So, I ended it. At first, I felt relieved. As time went on, I began to miss him. I eventually realized what he knew all along. I really did love him. 

The regret was strong and didn't go away after another few months, and we eventually got back together. His personality is all or nothing. It's something we've had to work on because I'm much more cautious. But I'm definitely glad we got back together. We're celebrating our fourth wedding anniversary in a few weeks and we have a son together. Worth it."

220,"A penguin went to the fair. It was a hot day, so he got an ice cream cone to eat while he wandered around. Unfortunately, it was so hot that it started dropping all over him, so he decided to head home and get cleaned up. 


He's driving his car home when he runs into engine trouble. He manages to pull into a mechanic's parking lot just in time. The mechanic comes out and takes a look under the hood for a minute. He looks over at the penguin and says, ""Looks like you blew a seal.""  The penguin goes, ""Nah, I was just eating ice cream."""
221,"My husband and I found $25 in the parking lot of a movie theater, and turned it in with a manager, despite being horrendously low on money ourselves. During that movie, the drug-addled gentleman who sat next to us kept giving us handfuls of pixie sticks and Charleston chews.

c.) social service wellness checks are regular 

d.) there is frequent and consistent socialization with other children and in other environments if at all possible "
225,"Spoilers alert for ""Age of Adaline"".

In the movie there's a scene where the main male character asks her out and she says no (this is after she has already gone out with him once because he kind of blackmailed her). He finds out where she lives from her work and waits by her house with flowers. She rightfully gets very angry at him and tells him to leave her alone. I applauded this scene.

And then what happens? She goes and apologizes to him! She wasn't angry because he was a stalker, she was angry because her dog just died. Way to send a message, movie. "

235,"I was taking my car in to get the winter tires off. I was between services (and couldn't be bothered to do it myself) so I was getting it done at a one of those drive-thru places it might have been a Jiffy Lube. 

One of the guys that works there comes out and tells me that he will drive the car in. Then slowly,  like I'm an idiot,  mansplains that I would have to drive my car just so to get it over the hydraulics and that there are big holes in the floor for getting under cars that aren't raised up. The jist his mansplaination being,  that it would he hard for a little woman like me to drive my car into the shop. 

So, they finish up with the guy ahead of me pretty quickly (we were the only two there). About ten minutes pass and they haven't brought my car in. I look out the waiting room window and see all six guys that are working there crowded around my car outside.

Now,  I started to get really nervous thinking something is wrong with my car. But I opt not to bother them,  figuring that they will come tell me what's wrong when they've got it figured out.

Another 15 minutes pass and someone pulls up behind my car. That's when the guy that originally explained to me how an auto shop works,  finally comes into the waiting room. It's been 25 minutes since the guy before me left, so I brace myself for awful news delivered in a mansplaination. 

But no, buddy politely asks me if I could drive my car onto the hydraulics for them. Turns out of all 6 dudes,  not a single one knows how to drive a standard.

So, after mansplaining to me that it would be hard for me to drive my car into the shop,  they waited almost a half an hour to tell me that not one guy in the shop could even drive my car."
236,That's... Honestly that's terrifying.

My grandparents married in the 1950s. We have *one* photo of their wedding. They're holding hands as they enter their home, which doubled as the reception. Sure, my grandfather's in white tie and my grandmother has gloves on, but she tailored everything herself, and the catering probably went that way too.

Even if they could pull this off today they'd be mocked. If the last wedding had ice sculptures and acrobats your wedding is supposed to top that...booking appointments to pick out a party dress 6 months in advance...dropping hundreds on flowers...all of that is standard.

If the time comes for me, I'm cool wearing a sun dress and having BBQ in the park afterwards."

247,"OMG I have so many!! Here are just a few that I remember off the top of my head:

1) This guy tried to give me an ultimatum that I either sleep with him after the first date or it's over within an hour of meeting me (Makes me wonder if he actually expects this to work?)

2) This guy who I went to get coffee with for like 45 min and never bothered to talk to again texted me a month later saying ""Your baby might be born"" (I'm yet to figure out WTF he's trying to say but I just blocked him instead of asking).

3) As soon as I sat down, the guy told me that he's in an open-relationship with a stripper, and as part of their full disclosure policy he'd be telling her all about our date.

4) The date went really well with this guy until he wanted to exchange ex stories (never a good idea for a first date IMO, but ok). Then he told me this woeful story of how his fiance dumped him soon after they moved to a new city to start a life together, and ""THE NEXT GIRL I DATE BETTER MARRY ME AS I CAN'T HANDLE BEING DUMPED AGAIN!!!!"""

250,"Sansa Stark from Game of Thrones. Sure, she was annoying and bratty at first, but after season 1, she really grew as a character. I know lots of people who are like, ""Arya is so much better because she can kick ass"", and yeah, Arya is cool, I can agree on that. However, as Arya noted in the first season (""Sansa has her needles. I have a needle of my own.""), they have different strengths.

Sure, Sansa doesn't know how to fight with swords, but she has an inner strength that's hard to beat. She was a naive girl who was placed into a cutthroat court, where speaking out of place or pissing off the wrong people could get your head chopped off. She was engaged to one of the most unpredictable psychopaths, who also happened to have the most power in all the Seven Kingdoms. That's terrifying! Plus, Cersei isn't exactly a model mother-in-law, either. Basically, Sansa was surrounded by some of the most cunning, backstabbing, and dangerous people in Westeros, *and she survived*, not to mention got in several of her own jabs towards Joffrey. Mentally, I think she's stronger than even Cersei, who is obviously embittered by her experiences at court and is insecure deep down, if how she treats other people (i.e. trying to bring them down so she can come out on top) is any indication. Court didn't even break Sansa's spirit (ok, she had her depressive episodes, but considering all the trauma she goes through, it's understandable); she still knows what she wants and goes for it (again, though, just not in the same way as, say, Arya or Daenerys).

To write off Sansa as weak is really just not giving her character a good, hard look, and I think people don't give her as much credit as she deserves."

He then, without any prior discussion or anything, wants to know if ""we ladies"" wanted him to show us how to lift weights.  Then, before we can respond, he starts in on how to do certain exercises what he can lift.  Do we want to watch him for awhile so we can get a better idea of it?

And then, to top it off, he tells me he is a personal trainer and, if we want, he will give us some free PT sessions.

Being one of the three PTs at the gym at the time, I was quite surprised he wanted to claim being a personal trainer.  I was even wearing a shirt that said ""Personal Trainer""."
255,Jesus fucking fuck. What is wrong with some men?
256,"Boyfriend and I broke up recently, I cried for an hour after changing my relationship status to single on Facebook. When we started dating it was so important to me because he isn't very expressive so it kind of validated to me that our relationship was real and serious, and because I was proud new girlfriend and wanted people to know we were dating! Having to physically change it from in a relationship with him to single was really hard for me because things were so different now. We both still have feelings for each other but we weren't happy so it just kind of rubbed salt in the very sensitive wound to have to break up again on Facebook."

I understand that a constant reminder of her husband's infidelity (as she believes) is painful, but in no way is that Jon's fault, and it's shitty for her to take it out on him. That beef is with Ned, not Jon. Don't mistreat an innocent kid. "
259,I like messing shit up. I just turned 30 and I am the only person over 18 in my family that has never been engaged/no kids/not married. Everyone has one or more of these. I'm the old maid.

No one knows what happened to them, but they were alive for at least 9 days after the first 911 call was made. Their camera was found, but it seems like they were mostly using the flash for light or to scare off animals, because the photos are all black except for a few showing trees and rocks. 

It's not that anything supernatural or weird happened, but I find the whole thing severely unnerving and depressing. I had sleepless nights thinking of how scared they must have been in the pitch black jungle for so long. And thinking that probably one of them died first, and how awful it would have been for the other to be on her own. I can't imagine how their loved ones feel. "

277,"The vast, vast majority of men that I know, think that they are forward thinking, and concerned with female pleasure if they say ""The lady always comes first.""  They say this because, obviously once they've had an orgasm, sex is done, and there is no negotiation there, and any extra attention given to the woman must be as part of foreplay.  It is completely impossible to, for example, have vaginal intercourse until the man ejaculates, take a minute to catch your breath, and then get back in there with your goddamn hands.  But that's how like 99% of lesbian sex works.  You figure out how to have an orgasm, and then continue pleasing your partner until she has one too.

Also, people seem to have this weird idea that doing anything forceful to a vagina with anything other than a penis is a threat to manhood."

(Or, and this is my inner cynic talking, I am a woman living in a man's world, so I just don't think it is a big deal to learn about ""guy stuff"" because I have to do it all the time.  You are a man in a man's world. It is strange and foreign for you to have to learn about feminine things.)"

283,"Robin on How I Met Your Mother. I just couldn't see anything ""wrong"" with her. She was a good friend, wasn't manipulative or dishonest, was independent and motivated in her career. Considering she was raised by that horrible father who was awful to her, she was pretty well adjusted and successful. I can see why people didn't like Lily - she *was* manipulative, underhanded, and not very nice to her group of friends.

Maybe this is too obscure, but Dexter's Boss Maria Laguerta. She was a single woman who didn't have kids who did things like embezzle, make shady back-room deals to further her career, cover things up when it benefited her, and okay but not great at her job. But that's not why reddit hated her, it was more because she was ""bossy"" or ""bitchy"" or something. All of those things seemed like they wouldn't get nearly that level as hate, had her character been written as male rather than female. She was the boss so she was acting like she was in charge, duh. I thought she was an interesting character especially for a woman: career driven, independent, seemed totally secure with herself/appearance, showed little interest in romantic relationships and no interest in a traditional/family lifestyle, fairly smart, stylish, and wasn't taking any of the sexist bullshit from the men that worked there. For a while she has a friend who is an openly feminist lawyer she hangs out with, that was awesome. And I wondered if she was even more hated by reddit since she's POC *and* female.

ETA: Add Dexter's sister, Debra. see below on this thread for more. but TL;DR : gets as much love from some as she gets hate from others for same reasons (codependency, not stylish). Only real transgressions according to the haters seem to be ""whiny"", ""talks too much"" and ""not hot enough""."
284,"Oh my god my ex was the same. Except he would get mad when I asked him to help me around the house because he never asked me to do anything, so why should I ask him? Nevermind that i did all the cooking, cleaning, laundry, taking care of the dog, took out the trash/recycling (most of the recycling was cases of soda cans from his computer room. He'd leave the empty cans anywhere there was space), and also made sure he never ran out of his insulin. Yeah, seriously.

He was also surprised when I wanted to leave- he couldn't believe I was leaving him. We tried counseling for a few months before he got pissed because everything was spun to make ot look like his fault. I left him the following summer. "
285,I knew when I started thinking about the future and he was always there. I also went to not wanting kids to wanting *his* kid (someday). 
286,"If I had my way, they would both be open adoptions because I think that the fewer things my kids have to wonder about, the better off they'll be.  I want to make sure they understand that they were not given away because of a lack of love, but because their other moms loved them so much, you know?  What better way for them to understand than to have the birthmoms tell them in person.

We have an open relationship with my son's birth family and while we do text and email with my daughter's, we haven't actually seen her since the birth.  She (birth mom) just isn't ready to do it.  Luckily, my son's other mom treats my daughter with the same love and affection.  Also, my daughter has a sibling who was placed for adoption the year before my daughter was born, and we do have regular meetings with him.  I want them to see and be around people who share the same physical features as they do.

They have both known that they were adopted from the very beginning, we have made sure to tell them that they have Mama Kisha's chin or a nose like Mama Lisa.  The other thing that I think is important is that we frame families in a different way in conversation.  We say that everyone has a birth mom and a birth dad, and most people have a mom and a dad who raise them.  With some people, the mom and birth mom and mom are the same, but for you, they are not."
287,"Bisexual girl here who recently ended a 2 and a half year relationship with another girl. 

I've noticed some things that were different about this relationship in comparison to my past relationships with men. Though I've had some experience with females before, this was my first long term homosexual relationship, so I can't tell for sure if these things are only about this particular person I've been with, nor how many of them apply to other girls. 

Anyway, I've noticed this great aspect of our relatonship: me and my ex girlfriend could chat for hours about our stuff that none of the guys I've been with would find interesting. Stuff like problems with friends in high school, make-up, losing weight, fashion, annoying people etc.

Another crucial thing was that she could understand emotions, how they work, how to show them, what caused them, how to induce them, heal them and everything about feelings. It made our relationship much deeper in that sense. She could understand everything I felt better than I understood it myself. 
Again, I don't know if this is due to the fact that she is a highly emotionally intelligent person, which I wasn't when I met her, or if it has to do anything with her being a girl. I only know it gave quality to every aspect of our relationship and it's, among other things, what made me bond with her so much."

293,"I have gotten in several arguments about this. I LOVE Sansa. Yes, she's obnoxious in the first season/book. She's a flipping teenager! Most teenagers go through an obnoxious phase. And she was brought up with ideas of nobility and fealty to the kingdom. Of course she was going to be taken advantage of by the Lannisters/Baratheons. The fact that she's still going and hasn't jumped off a castle ages ago speaks volumes about her character. "
294,"Ultimately, I want my life partner to be the person that I'm closest with and the person I feel comfortable sharing everything with. So yes, my SO is my best friend.

297,"I went from working 0 hours and spending all day on the couch to working standing up for 8 hours a day, 6 days a week. I don't know a way that doesn't make it exhausting at some level in the beginning, but good news is I got use to it in 2-3 weeks. What helps is boosting energy with nutritious food (breakfast is really important), drinking enough water throughout the day, and for muscle pain I liked menthol-y sprays/cold water on legs and feet at the end of the day."
298,"Among many things, the most annoying was when he didn't want to do something that was chore-like. He'd get this whiney little kid voice and say ""but (insert prolonged version of nickname)"" and then scrunch up his face like a 4 year old holding a tantrum and do a fake cry. I guess he thought it was fucking adorable, but it was the most annoying thing to see and quite revolting coming from someone two years older than me. And we're supposed to be adults."
299,"The lady did it to herself. Not sure if it counts, but I got a huge kick out of it.

I went to eat at a restaurant alone one evening. It wasn't busy, and it wasn't anything fancy, just a place to grab some chicken pasta and toast while I unwound from a long work day.

Growing up, I always deferred to strangers as ""sir"" or ""ma'am."" It was drilled into me that this was polite, so I still do it fairly often.

The waitress did *not* like that. Glared at me and said, ""I'm barely older than you. I'm not a 'ma'am.'""

Oooookay. Duly noted. I dropped any mention of her name/any polite references whatsoever. IE, ""Thank you, ma'am,"" became, ""Thank you.""

On the way out, I paid at the front, and she happened to be the one cashing my ticket. She hands me the receipt and says, ""Have a good night, ma'am--"" And *promptly* looks horrified with herself.

I laughed all the way out the door. Couldn't even respond with words. It was perfect."
300,"My worst one is we went to a dinner for a first date, he talked about other women he would invite over and get wasted with and play video games. He then told me I'm wearing hooker boots (I wasn't, I was wearing ankle boots with socks)."
301,"LMAOOO I saw that one. Dude was literally asking if women were able to ""think"".

That one was so funny because of the incredulous responses to his question. "
302,"The thing is, it's kind of a slow progression to evil. You start out liking him and sympathizing for him and the situation he is in. You also think Jesse is the bad guy. As the show and characters develop you realize that it the exact opposite, but for a little while you are riding that ""Walt-is-a-badass-and-is-doing-what-he-has-to-do-for-his-family"" train. This is my favorite element of the show, that they make you love an evil character and then you kind of snap out of it and realize he was a terrible person all along. "
303,"Couldn't be better. I've been slender to plus size and never had trouble getting laid. Men are awesome like that!! Work it girl ;). I have a friend who is at least 100lbs overweight and she usually has 3 or three potentials. 

FYI I'm in my 50s and still get as much action as I want from men 18 to 60. Don't let the media dictate your value. "
304,"I don't hate him. I wouldn't be in the amazing place I am now if I hadn't gone through the hell I went through to be here. 

He was a narcissistic manic depressive guy. (He took bipolar mood meds but never told me why and I'm assuming the narcissist tag) He was fun, charismatic and said once off things that made my heart swoon at the thought. He treated me so nicely and everyone just loved how nice he was. My parents were happy to have a second son, he was very polite and loved being apart of my very open loving family (his parents divorced when he was 3 and he never got over it even though his step father was amazing and his mum did the best she could). We were together for 4 years and bought a house and moved in together. 

It was like a switch flipped. He was mean and extremely critical of me. He made every decision I made a nightmare. I was stupid. I was wrong. I was the reason we had fights. I was overly emotional. Why do I need to kiss. Why do I need to be hugged. Why do I cry over this so much. Why can't I just accept it. I stressed him too much to have sex. (That was the kicker, he literally didn't touch me. If I sat next to him on the couch he would move.) If I hugged him, he wouldn't hug back. If I wanted to kiss him he wouldn't respond and would just lie straight in bed and wait for me to cry myself to sleep. When I asked him, multiple times why couldn't I touch him, kiss him or be near him he wouldn't answer. He'd literally leave the room and wait for me to cry myself to sleep. I was a wreck. I couldn't understand why the Man I loved treated me like this. I definitely deserved it. I definitely deserved this amount of love and if I loved him harder or not touched him or not cried or not fought with him or not talked to him, he'd love me again and we would be okay.....I was contemplating suicide because I just couldn't get past the idea that it was my fault.  He still loves me because he's with me and hasn't left me. I'm at fault. Etc. I was a wreck after being withheld every single thing that is nice in a relationship. 

So one day I realised that he might not have a towel in the bathroom and went to give him one and realised that he locked the door to the bathroom and I lost it. 

Our entire relationship of 5 years ended because he locked the door and wouldn't let me give him a towel. (I saw him naked once, had sex about 8 times in 5 years in pitch blackness). I have never found out why I deserved this treatment. I have no idea to this day why he didn't want to have sex with me or touch me or be touched. I think I was a cover for him, as in a beard but for a high functioning sociopath. I have never found out if he felt sorry, he did find out that at the end of the relationship I was suicidal and that I had six months of therapy after. 

So fuck you Danny.

As I said. I don't hate him. My current partner is the most open caring loving guy and just loves me the exact way I need to be loved. (Love language is so important to match up guys!) Everyone kind of overlooks him because he's not traditionally good looking but he spoils me and makes me laugh like no one ever has. And without my previous relationship, I would have overlooked him too and wouldn't appreciate all the little things he does to make me smile.

316,"It really is a shame about Ygritte on the show.  I enjoyed her character in the books quite a bit, but the show didn't really portray her in the same way (probably, like you said, because fap material).

Gilly just feels like a joke in the show.  Like, ""haha! Here's this stupid inbred girl who doesn't understand anything"" while completing ignoring the reasons she is the way she is (severe abuse, no exposure to the world).  The show also ignores one of her biggest character points - her role as a mother.  She makes a hugely painful sacrifice in the books in order to protect both her own child and the child of another woman."
317,"Meet a man, have his children, put your entire life on hold to tend to them and your man and your household, but if you care about your spouse's income or won't sign a prenup that leaves you with nothing or seek alimony or child support if things fall through, you're a gold digger.

My particular favorite though, is that in the eyes of (#notall) men, if you'll have sex with anyone who *isn't* him, you're a ""slut,"" but if you won't have sex *with* him, then you're stuck up and why won't you give him a chance and he's such a nice guy... "

322,"My female friends are LOYAL. Like crazy loyal. 

My male friends aren't disloyal, they just peace out after a while. My SO is loyal, but he for different reasons and in different ways. 

I can call up a female friend of mine I haven't seen in years and be like ""can you believe this shit that happened to me?"" And she'll say ""what?! Hell no. Unacceptable,"" before talking to me for hours about why it was so wrong. 

The idea that women are backstabbers and fickle friends to each other just doesn't make sense in my world. "
323,"If a woman doesn't remove her body hair or wear makeup, she's ugly and/or unclean. If she does these things, she's wasting her man's precious time and/or money getting ready, or trying to deceive them about what she ""really"" looks like.

If a woman wears too many clothes, she's frumpy. If she wears too little, she's a whore.

If a woman's body doesn't match one specific celebrity's body, she's too fat, too skinny, too muscular, flat-chested, flat-assed, lazy, image-obsessed, or anorexic.

If a woman has a lot of sex, she's a whore. If a woman doesn't have a lot of sex, she's frigid.

If a woman is career oriented, she's selfish. If she's a stay-at-home mom, she's a moocher.

326,"Background - I tend to be the advice giver in friendships. I'm happy to be the shoulder to lean on and the giver of direct advice. I try very hard not to ask for this in return often because I know that when I will need it, it will be a larger scale issue. I explain this to people. I won't ask often, but please be there for me the few times I need you. The friend in question was also aware of abandonment issues I was still trying to sort out in therapy. 

Anyhow, this friend had been my close friend for years. I hand held him through breakups, family problems, dating issues, you name it. There were months at a time where we spent hours with me essentially giving free therapy. I helped him pick clothes for dates or to go to clubs. I helped him with online dating profiles and messages. You name it, I was there. 

I have Bipolar so my mood swings. My mood had started to swing down pretty bad and I was holding through as best I could with no insurance or meds. One day I get to a breaking point and I just really need someone to just sit with me and make sure I don't do anything to hurt myself.  I call my friend. I say hey I'm really not doing well, please just come sit with me. We don't have to talk I know heavy depression can be a strange topic. Just sit with me, make sure I'm safe. He tells me he's going tubing or some other water thing in a few hours, wants to go drink on the water. I say I haven't asked for you to be there for me like I am for you in years. I'm asking this one thing. He says no, today is his fun day so he won't be coming or talking to me on the phone. Basically after years of unending support given, knowing full well I have abandonment issues, he left me high and dry the one time I actually needed him. If I had never done anything for him, I could understand. But after years of playing therapist and appearance helper and wing woman and all this other stuff?  What the fuck, man. 

This was I would say 11 or 12 years ago?  We remained friends for a while after but the whole relationship slowly collapsed after that. Anyhow, my SO is still kinda friends with him and in the last year there was some discussion about why I wasn't interested in repairing the friendship any longer. My SO reminded him of this particular event and I guess something about the way he worded it was a lightbulb moment because my SO says his face dropped. So apparently despite multiple conversations he didn't see this incident as a big deal at all where to me it was the beginning of the end.  "
327,"A little over four years ago I was told that I was too sick to be in education and too sick to work. I went through a rough couple of years, family members died,  others became quite ill and I had to see a few therapists. Now four years on, after all that has happened, I've been accepted to study engineering in one of the top ten universities in the UK (for engineering, not overall) "
328,"I felt like she was clearly the ""cool girl,"" like they talk about in Gone Girl. She loves beer and scotch, sports, guns and cigars! She eats whatever she wants all the time and never exercises but is in perfect shape! She just doesn't get along with most girls (except Lily) 'cuz she's one of the guys BUT is also smoking hot! It's not like this can't exist, but she was so obviously written this way to be the ""perfect"" girl, so Ted/Narrator could be obsessed with her. 

I get that it *could* be biased because it's told all from Ted's perspective, but while I find it charming in 500 Days of Summer, I don't think it was made clear enough that Ted was exceptionally biased in telling it all to his kids."
329,"She's just fap material for the male audience. Like, that was the total of her character.

330,"&gt; I look down, and this guy has quietly padded up behind me, crouched down on the floor, and bit my upper arm. In fact, he's still biting/attached to my arm, even as I'm looking down, realizing what's happening. We make uncomfortable eye contact, biter to bitee. 

This bit cracked me up. Would love to see this guy on Jeremy Kyle.

How supportive &amp; celebrative of you they can be. How they don't automatically assume your lying when you tell them about creepers &amp; such. How even women who are strangers are so kind &amp; helpful &amp; will usually back you up without a second thought. How they give you legit compliments without expecting anything in return. How we can just hang about doing nothing &amp; talking about anything &amp; everything even the most mundane stuff &amp; still have a good time. How they more often understand &amp; respect my boundaries &amp; accept without sulking that no means no. How they point out the good things about you. How nice they smell.

332,"Edith Crawley from Downton Abbey. I'm not sure how much the average fan hated her, but the online fandom has always been very pro-Mary and anti-Edith (imo).

I'd be the first to admit that Edith could definitely be quite bitter in the beginning of the show, but she honestly has good reason to be:

* Before the series starts, she has to sit by as Mary gets engaged to Patrick, the man she loved. When he dies, she has to deal with Mary treating it as a happy occasion. 

* She's not as beautiful as her sisters, and constantly has it rubbed in her face. When she first became interested in Anthony Strallan, Mary swooped in and monopolized his attention just to prove she could. (She did something similar when Edith tried pursuing Matthew—again, after Mary had completely dismissed him.)

* Her mother says that Edith will probably be the one to care for them when they are old (implying that she won't get married), which her father calls ""a ghastly thought."" A+ parenting!

* Mary then ruins Edith's impending marriage to Bertie Pelham by letting him know she has an illegitimate daughter. Why? If Edith did marry him, she would be higher ranked than Mary. (I haven't seen this far, but apparently Mary does get called out on it, at least.)

Basically, if I had grown up being relentlessly bullied and mocked like this, I would probably be bitter and unpleasant too. \#TeamEdith for life."
333,"I didn't know an erect penis could move. I thought it was 100% stiff, perpendicular to his body. Straight out. 

When I was a teenager and first learned of morning wood from my male friends, I didn't understand *how* peeing could make it go away. How the hell would they pee? Lay across the toilet?

A year or so later, my bff was giving me the deets of her first penis experience and explained that at one point it was pressed against his stomach. This completely blew my mind about the mechanisms of sex. "
334,"Huh. I have a couple male characters that I liked that the majority didn't, but I genuinely can't think of any male characters that unproportionally received the *viciousness* that a lot of female characters received.  
  
Maybe the only examples I could give would be male *children* characters like Wesley (TNG) and early-season Carl (The Walking Dead). They both received more dislike than I think was particularly warranted, since they were kids and naturally did stupid and annoying things.  
  
But in general adult male characters I don't think get the level of unproportional hate that female characters get, they almost always have a vocal contingent of defenders, or they're given a complex backstory to humanize their awfulness.  
  
Like for example Dukat (DS9) and Joffrey (GoT) were male characters that fans hated (or loved to hate) and they were *proper monsters*, and I don't think even they received the *level* of vitriol that Lori (Walking Dead) and Skylar (Breaking Bad) received for just being semi-normal people who just made mistakes and could be regular shitty people."
335,"He had been at work all day, and I had to tell him our cat died. I sat him down and broke it gently and he just sat there, really quiet. I asked him if he was okay, and he replied that he was fine, very calmly. He then stood up and said he needed to go get some milk from the shops. I looked in the fridge and we had plenty of milk, so I ran outside to tell him. He was sitting in the car just bawling his eyes out. I pulled the door open before saying to him ""We already have loads of milk"", and he laughed through the tears. I just remember holding him then for such a long time and it was so nice."
336,"Sometimes, I don't like to assume a man is ""mansplaining"" because he may be the type to over explain everything to everyone--men included. So I try to only assume it in situations where a man is telling me about LADY STUFF.

My father has a tendency to tell me what women believe. He generalizes to a laughable degree and tells me, his Master's educated feminist daughter-- about women's overall opinions and flaws. So, not only is he being sexist, but his ""mansplaining"" is inaccurate. "
337,"The time when a data analyst explained to me, the main engineer on the project, that I wasn't qualified to comment on anything in the meeting because I was new and didn't know anything. His boss (who later became one of my good buddies) was STUNNED.

He also asked me to stay behind and ""help"" him on something after the meeting and after everyone left he started explaining to me how he hadn't wanted to ~intimidate me and he could tell he had (no, I hadn't been, his boss had actually told him to listen to me before I could calmly destroy his ego), and how he knows it's difficult to be a female engineer and how he wants to be supportive because he has daughters and he's afraid how the world will treat them in the future."
338,"Hey, just so you know it's kinda gross to tell someone who is being coerced into sex they don't want that ""at least you're getting some."""
339,"I've been sort of reading through your replies and stuff. It looks like you're interested in breaking up because you're relationship is frustrating you, but you can't find the justification to do so. Your relationship is just 'not bad' enough that you can't bring yourself to do it.

You can leave if you want, and I think you'll be fine on your own. You don't need that man's high paying job to make it. You can live on your own, fuck around, and be perfectly happy. 

However, it also sounds like you can stay if you think it's worth it. Your man doesn't sound like that bad of a guy. He wants to win the bread and relax at home without worrying about any household stuff. Since you have a job as well, you don't really want to worry about the household stuff either, so you're both asking each other to do more than the other is willing to do. 

You're frustrated because your guy uses his pay as leverage, which is totally unacceptable. You can use his desire to keep being in a relationship as leverage. If he wants a fucking housewife, tell him to go find one who's unemployed. That's not you. If you two are working the same hours and the bills are getting paid, it doesn't really matter who's making more money. Tell him you're not impressed, and you won't be doing any more chores than you think is fair. 50/50 is fair. Maybe you can give him the chores you like least, like laundry or mowing or whatever, and you can take the stuff he doesn't like to do, like sweeping and cleaning bathrooms.

Your relationship sounds like it's going through an immature phase, not by any fault of yours but because the two of you can't seem to compromise. This doesn't seem like a deal breaker. If you absolutely can't reach an agreeable solution, then you may be looking at an early sign of a deal breaker, but at this stage I would recommend sticking it out. If you stand your ground and make it clear that you have expectations for a long term SO that he needs to meet if he wants to be in the picture, then you have a good chance of lasting.

That's my two cents."

We were discussing if we were compatible and I was just criticizing him a lot and thats when they welled up and he said ""I have no major problems with you. You seem to have all these problems with me. If you dont like who I am then maybe we should just....break up."". Jeez, thats when I saw that I was approaching him in the wrong way and just needed to lay off sometimes. 

But I am glad this only happened one time. For the most part we are usually crying while laughing about something together"

I would get high just to fall asleep I was so uncomfortable and would wake up feeling like I was hit by a truck. A soft bed and good sleep is an absolute must and I told him right off that I couldn't and wouldn't  sleep here unless he made changes. So far I've progessed to 4 inch mattress topper but I'm far from getting good sleep for other reasons too like his dogs in the bed, too warm in the room, bad piilows, etc. I will prevail damn it."
352,"I've been on hormonal birth control for about ten years (the pill for many years, Mirena for a few others and NuvaRing for a couple of months). I always had quite a low libido and sex would hurt often. I would actually get tears down there, so I wasn't fond of the act. 

Now I'm off birth control for more than two years. We use condoms and I couldn't be happier! I haven't had any tears anymore, at all, and my libido is way way up. And it seems I have my emotions in check more, but I'm not a 100% sure. I can still be quite emotional, but at least now I know it's because it's who I am, and not because of the pills I take.

I won a karaoke machine and one day was in my room singing away to Britney (I'm A Slave For You), when best friend walked in on me. We both laughed about it, she told all our friends, that song became ""my"" song and it was a whole 'thing', but one I too found hilarious.

Friend was in a musical society and they were doing a karaoke night fundraiser for their upcoming show, we all went to lend our support and you can imagine my horror when the host called out my name and said I'd be singing I'm A Slave For You. My friends all laughed and said they'd come up and join me and it's no big deal.

Again, this was a musical theatre group so this was a really talented group of people. I, am completely tone-deaf, I couldn't sing in tune if my life depended on it.

My friends didn't join me on stage, they left me there, red faced and alone. After what felt like an eternity, a girl who was there ran up to me and was like ""I love this song, do you mind"" and proceeded to kill it, because duh, she's the lead in the musical.

I don't. I have held on to these things over the years, especially because it started when I was in my early teens and made me believe my value was determined by how many guys wanted me for a very long time. These men disgust me in every possible way. They are so selfish and their world revolves so much around how their dicks feel to the point they will compromise others safety and self worth just for a glance or shout. If they are directly harassing me I'll tell them to fuck off. Often I will just remove myself from the situation. 

Ultimately there is nothing I can do to stop it in the first place. I just accept their harassment as a daily occurrence when I leave my house. A world where men treat me like a human being is a delusion until I'm old enough and unattractive enough for them to not bother. "

Guy messages me and explains that he has some major sexual dysfunction (I forget the details, but basically massive PE or ED). He's currently dating ""several"" women he actually likes, and he thinks they'll all have sex with him, but he's worried about his performance. Since I identified as poly at the time, he was wondering whether I'd ""let him practice."" Surely I'd have things I'd want to try on him in return. 

I was so flabbergasted. I didn't have the heart to tell him that being a poly woman provided me with several excellent partners who were high-functioning in all respects and even managed to treat me decently while they're at it. Or that his stable of love interests might not drop their drawers in unison if they heard about his bizarro arrangement. "
373,"He was super pushy about all things sexual, I was really timid back then and didn't know how to say no. He fingered me so hard, I bled and when he went down on me he bit my clit really hard :(
