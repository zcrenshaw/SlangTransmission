0,"One of my front teeth is slightly crooked. He would stare at it constantly and not listen to what I was saying. As a result, he would accidentally agree to things that I said and then have to go along with it (""Hey, do you want to go see the Barenaked Ladies this Friday?...Jerry?"" ""What, oh sure...OH NO!""/ ""Jerry, do like hot yoga?"" ""What? Oh sure..."" ""Great, I'll buy us a 2/week 6 month subscription"" ""OH NO!"")

He would talk about this constantly to Elaine and George, eventually naming my crooked tooth ""The 
Slant.""

One night, after weeks of Jerry having to volunteer at dog shelters and go to see foreign films, we would be eating dinner at a Chinese restaurant. Like all of our dates, I would be talking, he would be staring at The Slant and just nodding along. At one point he would realize that he agreed to take an 8 hour pottery class. This will be the straw that broke the camel's back and he will yell out: WHAT?? No! I wasn't paying attention. I WAS TOO BUSY STARING AT THE SLANT!

Me, and everyone else in the restaurant, would assume that he was using a racial slur against the Chinese waitress standing next to me. I would leave him immediately because I can't date a racist. The restaurant would ask him never to return.

edit: Thanks, guys! I used to watch a lot of Seinfeld 

edit 2: obligatory thanks for the gold, stranger! You guys are the best. You've given this slanty-toothed girl a big crooked smile today :)"
1,"Well I spend all my money on avocado toast so the real estate industry.  


Can't afford both!"
2,"He said ""touche"" the way we now say ""lol"". Like it was just a meaningless filler word used to respond to anything. ""I'm not coming over tonight"" ""touche"". ""Grab me a beer and I'll be there in ten"" ""touche"". I'm not even an English snob. I don't correct other people when they use the wrong ""to"" or anything. But that shit made me insane. He was also a late 30s barfly/bouncer still living with multiple roommates and dating 19 year olds, but it was the touche that led to the breakup. "
3,shitty friends
4,"He freaked out when he realized that I am left handed because he heard that lefties are sinister. 

Wtf

I devoured his soul before dumping him as is tradition."
5,"Not knowing when to stop. That's why there's that saying about how ""no"" doesn't mean ""convince me"". "
6,I don't care if you find something I do unattractive. 
7,Did a bad DIY taxidermy job of his cat. Little too weird for me.
8,"If asked point blank why I left the position, I would say I didn't like the company's ethics. If I was pressed past that, I'd straight out say what happened, but most interviewers are content to know that much.

In addition to harassment, I once left a job at a pet store because I found out about unethical practices when it came to their animals, so it works in a variety of situations."
9,"Maybe not really 'dumped' so much as just didn't continue past the first date, but he arrived to our first date in a truck that not only had a pair of balls in the trailer hitch, but also had a bumper sticker that said ""Dodge the father, Ram the daughter"".  Kind of humorous, but definitely not somebody I'd take to meet my family..."
10,"Opinion on makeup (or anything else, really). Anytime I hear someone say, ""Guys don't like it when girls..."" I immediately tune out. 

Also, penis size. Unless it happens to be uncomfortably large, but let's be honest that doesn't happen much. 

"
11,"Forgetting that they're just regular people. If you think someone is hot, interesting, cool just go talk to them and have a normal conversation. "
12,"It's been fine but you need to be fair to the dog. 

To me that means a walk or run before work and long walks and play time after work every day, trips to the park, etc.

A bored dog can be a destructive dog, especially if it lacks exercise and mental stimulation.

I wouldn't get one if you're going to kennel them all day and then at night. No dog should live in a cage for 1/2 it's life for a person's convenience."
13,"Definitely cable. I live in Canada and the cable/internet packages just seem so ridiculous here. And personally I find it hard to find anything worth watching anyway. I'm so tired of the shitty reality-tv enterprise that's going on. Don't get me wrong, I do love a few of them. But it's so frustrating to scroll through channels and literally every one plays nothing but reality or weird game show-esque programs. You can't just have a cooking show, it has to be a wacky competition series. Can't have a history documentary, it has to be some cringy pawn shop reality show. It makes me so happy to see Netflix so successful! "
14,Not asking questions about me.
15,"I was 15 with my first boyfriend. We were making out on my bed and he turns around to reach for something, facing his backside towards me and I realize: He smells like poop!! 

Cue me spending the next 30 min trying to confirm that he actually smells like poop. He did. Broke up with him the next day.

Petty? Maybe but I'd do it again!!"
16,"He lived thirty minutes away, and the price of gas kept going up. I didn't feel as though he was worth it. "
17,Interpreting politeness (especially women at work) as attraction.
18,"Any text following up on why I hadn't responded to a previous text. ""Hello?"" ""You mad or something?"" ""Not interested anymore?"" ""Guess you're busy."" ""I'll leave you alone now."" UGHHHH. Any of those made me anxious about continuing the conversation. I wanted someone who was secure and confident in themselves, not someone I had to build up and reassure all the time."
19,"I arrived late to a friends party since I worked late. As I came through the front door, I saw my friends sitting at the table. They all turned around and yelled ""Heidi!""

I asked if they had planned that. They said ""No, we were just happy to see you.""

For someone who grew up without any friends and still had a lot of issues with insecurities, that meant more to me than I could explain."
20,We got into a fight about what the word vagabond meant.  He thought it meant someone of royalty.  He was already on thin ice for saying theee-ater instead of theater. 
21,"Always, always use condoms. And I've had a tubal ligation for birth control. Trust your gut for safety about going home with someone. Don't drink too much. "
22,Michelle Obama. She is so educated and carries herself with so much grace. I love listening to her speeches.
23,"Luckily I had a female interviewer. Conversation went like this:

""Why are you looking at leaving Company A after 4 months?""

I said ""I don't feel that it is the team environment I have been looking for and would like something that allows me to contribute doing individual projects and values my experience on team projects""

Her ""Can you give me an example of a time that you did not feel valued on a team project?""

Me ""Well, honestly the last straw that finally made me decide it was time to look elsewhere was a colleague and I were tasked with creating some training material for customers and employees. Everything went relatively well in the 2 weeks it took us to get the documents corrected and approved. When it came time to present to management, my supervisor approached me and told me I was not dressed appropriately for the presentation and would not be included in the meeting. When I asked what was wrong, he said my skirt was not short enough and he hoped in the future I would dress in a way that will hold the audience's attention. When I went to the HR representative, he said he felt there was nothing wrong with the comment.""

Her ""And were there incidents prior to that in which you had approac?""

Me ""Yes""


Her ""Then that makes sense""

Interview continued as normal.. got the call I had the job 4 days later."
24,"Paper napkins, apparently. Should I feel bad about that?

Any industry we're ""killing"" deserves to be dying because either it's no longer necessary or they failed to adapt to a changing consumer base."
25,"honesty. i don't understand the unnecessary lying about stupid shit or the avoiding talking about tough subjects that really need to be talked about. I don't care if you did something stupid, I care about you being honest about it. "
26,Their opinion on what I wear. 
27,"My young teen daughter became ill and we didn't know what was wrong with her. At first it seemed like a stomach bug, then a virus because it wasn't showing up in tests ams wasn't improving. For 6 months I watched her in agony every time she ate. Until she was barely eating and had loads of tests but they found nothing physically wrong with her.  So by 8 months she started seeing a therapist for eating difficulties, diagnosed with anxiety due to the original stomach pain.
And then a few months later her heart, kidneys and liver were becoming impaired. She was terribly thin and very low heart rate. She was put in hospital and a new diagnosis of atypical anorexia. 
She was stabilised and sent home for me to re feed. I really can't describe how horrendous the re feeding process is when someone's brain is hell bent on starving to death. I'll point out here that anorexia is a brain based illness. No shame, no blame!

This went on 4 months, we made progress but then got stuck. Over and over. 
Then I accidentally discovered her search history and OMG it was full blown anorexia. The most heart breaking searches...i wept for my girl that was being held hostage by this monster.

When she knew we knew she dug in harder. 

I was already exhausted as i was trying to get her to eat 6 times a day, with post meal supervision and some meals would take 2 hours or more. She was allowed 10 mins walk every other day and we had to take her to the hospital twice a week for checks.
I had to to stop her compulsively exercising even at night. My husband worked and tried to help but she wouldn't let him in the room when she was trying to eat so it was on me.
Meanwhile my older teen son was freaking out and experimenting with drugs. He actually got hit my a minibus whilst drink one night and still that wasn't the worse thing that happened that year. 

A month later my precious girl was admitted to an adolescent  inpatient unit. And part 2 started.
This is getting so long! Thank you if you are still reading.
I won't go into details because honestly it was one thing after another.
She was at the unit for 10 months, 8 months of that was with an ng feeding tube.
She avoided being sectioned 5 times and the lead up to each time was horrendous. 
We visited every day, sometimes twice a day. Sometimes she refused to see us or walked out.

My son visited but couldn't get out of bed wirh depression for days after. 
We were all so broken and desperately sad.

Until finally part 3...coming home! No means recovered but physically she was a healthy weight and best of all, able to eat! 

She has been home 10 months now and it's been just over 3 years since the stomach pains started.

She's having a bit of a struggle at the moment but we're on it, and we have a great team of professionals around us.

Anorexia is so misunderstood and misrepresented yet such a serious illness that has the highest mortality rate of all psychiatric illnesses.

I'm hoping she will fully recover, back to how she was before the illness. 

Thank you for reading.

Edit : I'm in the UK. 
Also just realised I didn't answer the second part of the question,  how I coped. I just focused/focus on her staying alive in the early stages and now fully recovering. I never hope for anything less than full recovery. 
And practically I took one hour/meal/day at a time and nothing else mattered. I let a lot of stuff go including friends that didn't get it and a business.
As she's rebuilding her life now so am I.
She and all you amazing people recovering from this evil illness are the strongest people I know.

33,"I'd be fine with it, I trust him. Plus I go out with my single and ready to mingle friends all the time and he's ok with it. If I know that I can hang out with my friends and chat to guys without being at all sexually interested in them or tempted to cheat, then it's not fair for me to treat him like he can't do the same. At the end of the day, we trust each other and we know what the consequences are of having that trust broken ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ "

36,"Best man and his fiancee were a lovely poly couple who were respectfully hitting on women who seemed like they'd be into it to join them for the night. Maid of honour's frat boyfriend took offence to not being invited to join (because monogamous and not female) and publicly and with feeling groped the best man's fiancee, then told the whole 150 person wedding what she was up to. Best man then suggested they take this out of the venue, frat boyfriend swung at him and broke his nose, groom (bigger angrier brother of best man) came running up and suckerpunched frat boyfriend, maid of honour went for groom's face with her special wedding nails. Somehow the fighting moved outside, the best man's fiancee had to leave because he'd torn her dress and her boob was hanging out, the bride was lying on the dancefloor sobbing and ultimately the whole scene was lit up by tasteful blue and red flashing lights as groom, best man, frat boyfriend and maid of honour were all arrested.

REALLY awkward, especially as the bride's mother made it very clear we were all expected at brunch the next morning. At brunch the best man's fiancee was wearing a top that displayed the bruises she'd sustained during the sexual assault, the bride was obviously devastated and had been crying all night and Fight Club was conspicuously absent."
37,"Oh my god that's amazing. Every time I see truck nuts in the wild, I wonder about the person driving it. Like at what point do you reach the decision to purchase and affix a pair of testicles to your truck? Was it an impulse buy? Was it a gift? Did they actually have to go and seek out a place to buy truck nuts, or do they frequent some type of store I'm not aware of where truck nuts are just available for purchase? What do their friends and family think of them? Are there whole communities that enjoy the message and aesthetic of balls hanging from a trailer hitch? And what are they trying to convey about themselves as a person by choosing that?

Seriously so many questions."
38,"And it's always ""unladylike"" like that's a PC way of saying it. ""*Thats not very ladylike*""


Listen here Billy Bob Brosph, I'm not gonna let some dude tell me what is and is not ladylike. You are not the lady police, and I don't give a shit if you think I'm acting uncouth. "

41,"- That they find x, y, or z about me unattractive. But since they've started the ""critique one another"" game, I'll play too! They usually don't enjoy it when it is my turn even though they started the game and included me.

- That they don't like how opinionated I am. I, too, am a human being bestowed with opinions and I, too, am bestowed with a mouth with which to give those opinions voice. They don't have to agree with my opinions, but suggesting that I ought not to have/voice them is nonsense.

- Their height. Be you, dude. If you don't like you, that's not a me problem.

- Their bank account balance or any wealth displays. I'm not for sale. I have my own. I need to know that you are a good *person*, not a good *consumer*.

- Their penis size. Why no, thank you, I don't enjoy being regularly punched in the cervix. Do you enjoy being regularly kicked in the balls? Then you might not want to boast about having something that will regularly cause me that kind of pain.

- How often they have white knighted. Perhaps it is in the telling, but *please* include the part where someone solicits your assistance before telling me how you paternalistically swept in and saved the day. Otherwise, I'm actually not impressed."
42,I didn't know what to get him for Christmas 
43,"It was the day the world was supposed to end. December 21, 2012. To celebrate such an amazing occasion, my roommates and I had a giant ""End of the World"" themed party. All of our friends were home for the holidays. Even people we hadn't seen in a few years. It was the greatest. None of us knew, though, that one of the people at that party would never be seen again.

A week later, people started posting all over Facebook that they hadn't heard from Robbie. His family. His friends. He was out drinking with the people he lived with and never came home. It wasn't uncommon for him to randomly skip town. Just hop on a bus or train or even hitch and be gone for months at a time. But he always communicated he was leaving. This time.. nothing. 

We didn't know what to do. We all talked about driving down to where he was currently living and holding search parties. But the weather was too extreme, as it usually is with Wisconsin winters at the end of December. Almost a week passed, and my friends and I were at our typical bar for watching the Packers game.

There was a news break at halftime. The headline just read ""Body of missing man found in river."" We saw where the story was coming out of - the same town Robbie lived in. The video showed clips of rescue crews in the river, with a black body bag on the side. Then they did it, they cut to a picture of his face, as his family had already identified that it was him. All of us there, his closest group of friends, getting the news broken to us like that... I'll never let go of how that felt.

I went into work the next day drained and depressed. At least, however, there was closure. Dealing with a missing person is really hard because you have no information. No reasoning. You play a million scenarios in your head. You don't even know if they're dead or alive. 

I sat down at my computer and pulled up Facebook, because I was a little early. The very first post on my front page was my cousin's fiance.. posting a missing person's article for my cousin who had gone missing the night before.  I threw my mouse. Turned off my monitor and walked out of work without saying a word to anyone. I texted my roommate telling him to be ready for me at home because I really needed a hug in that moment.

I don't remember driving. I remember just ending up at my back door and walking up the stairs and collapsing on the kitchen floor in tears. I drank and chainsmoked all day. I didn't talk. I just stared out the window. I texted my mom, told her to call me when she was done with work so I could talk to her. I told her what was going on, she asked where I was. When I told her I left work to be home she told me I should have stayed and that I need to learn how to deal with these things.

One of my best friends just died. The funeral was in four days. And I had to make the life choice of going to the funeral or going with my family to search for my cousin where he went missing. Hardest choice ever.

I went to the funeral. We never found my cousin that day. His body wasn't found until about four months later on the lake, picked up by a fisherman's sonar equipment.

Life is fucking cruel sometimes.  "
44,"Magazines. I don't think I've ever paid for one. I have about a dozen free subscriptions from different rewards sites. I get Better Homes &amp; Gardens, Wine Spectator, Afar, Entertainment Weekly, Time, Woman's Day, CNET, and some others. 

I guess it depends on your definition of ""kill,"" though. My understanding is that the reason why they enter into these rewards agreements is because they make more money off the advertisements (which are often based on circulation numbers) than a paid subscription."
45,"He was someone who developed strong body odor fast. Not that he wasn't hygienic, he took good care of himself. But he would start smelling of sweat very strongly even after showering and as someone with a sensitive nose, I couldn't deal with it. It is mean, I know."
46,"How much they *totally* care about women/think women are so awesome/treat women *so* well

Or, how I'm not like other girls/they wish more women could be like me.

All of these set off instant alarms in my head."
47,"Smelling like poop is not petty in my opinion. I mean, it's poop!"
48,"If they brag about being in fist fights in the past so they sound ""tough"".  It makes me think they're hot headed and irrational.  "
49,Shitty diet including overeating; not caring about the quality/variety of their diet; not being able to cook anything; being extremely picky; forgetting to have meals on a regular basis.
50,Malala Yousafzai. She is proof that a young girl can make her voice heard and I feel encourages girls to recognize their own strength and confidence. I read her book in college and felt completely blown away by her intelligence and courage.

Be kind and polite at all times, but don't you dare ""lead a man on"" by being too polite when you're not actually interested in him. And when you're not interested in someone, there are kind and polite ways to do it; if you're too forceful then you're rude. But if you turn someone down in a kind and polite way and he doesn't grasp that you're not interested then you should have been more forceful; you're clearly asking for his (unwanted) attention.

"
54,"Well, this is funny. 

I'm a dog walker. I'm the person who takes your dog on its midday walk while you are at your 9-5. 

My schedule is 10-6 most days and my dog has a dog walker come Tuesday/Thursday because I have training clients midday and can't make it home to walk him those days at like 2-3pm. 

Honestly, if you can afford it, and they have in your area, get a dog walker. Your dog will actually appreciate it. 

I have clients who say their dogs don't get THAT excited to see them the way they get excited to see me. 

EDIT: So I've actually gotten 3 PMs complaining to me that I am a ""horrible dog owner"" for having a dog walker while I am a dog walker and why don't I take my dog with me to work. Let me answer that for you. I am on my feet for 8+ hours a day. My dog is a Pit/Boxer mix with joint problems. It will not make ANY sense for me to take him to work with me. Not only will he have to walk the whole hour to get to my first client from my apartment, but he will be around puppies who haven't been vaccinated, aggressive dogs that are both bigger and smaller than him, and stand around in the heat for multiple hours a day and what am I supposed to do when I'm training a dog one on one? Tie him up somewhere??? For real, it makes sense for him to stay home. He's only by himself from 9:30-1:30 &amp; 3-6:30 most weekdays. He's a lazy ass, he's fine by himself, calm the heck down. "
55,"I suspect we apply the term differently.

For me casual sex is ""not looking for a relationship"". My FWBs are usually guys I've known for a while before hooking up, so that's my first safety measure. 

I also prefer long term FWBs - the sex is better and the risk is smaller.

Health care I usually use condoms. And regular testing."
56,Assuming it's okay to touch you. Like placing their hand on your back or squeezing your hand after a joke. Some guy had the gall to trace a scar on my back from an old surgery. Not cool.
57,"He wanted his filet mignon extra well done.

I made dinner one night and asked how he liked his meat to be cooked.  He said very well done, no pink at all.  When it was time for the meat to come out, he lasked ""can you leave it in longer?""  Those steaks were overcooked, dry, and leathery as all fuck.  He said they were perfectly done.

I can't be with a man that likes his meat overdone and cooked to shit."
58,"My best friend's sister was getting married and had a photo booth for the reception.  Guests didn't know but there were two copies of the pictures being printed, one for guests and one for their wedding photo album.  The groom's mom got very drunk and started getting a little loose in the photo booth, taking pictures revealing her bra, making sexual poses, etc.  Then she starts pulling women in the photo booth and kissing them mid picture, my best friend, her mom, and a few others.  She had no idea about the double copy of pics and was apparently very embarrassed about them when she found out they were in their wedding album"
59,"Probably the year span when my dad (55) died in a plane crash, and then 10 months later my mom (52) got diagnosed with stage 4 kidney cancer and then died within a week of the one year anniversary of my dad dying. I now call that week in July death week. 

Obviously very sad, lots of grief and mourning. It'll be 10 yrs from my dad's death this year. It doesn't really affect my daily life any more. I still miss them, but I have moved on and can enjoy life again. 

"
60,He had erectile dysfunction and blamed me for not helping him keep it up like sorry I'm not hot enough for you but I'm not sure thats how ED works... Then he would get mad at me if I eventually got discouraged and turned off by his limp dick trying to smash into me. Get over yourself pal..
61,"your ""boring"" hobbies and interests. do i play DnD? no. but would i love to hear u go off about it? heck ya"
62,"A friend of mine had her first serious LTR with a guy she met when she was in her mid-50s. First guy she ever lived with, and they're still going strong many years later.

She's a real personality with several quirks, but a heart of gold. He is divorced and says that taught him the difference between what is important and not."
63,"Ate a pint of ice cream and didn't offer me any. I was pregnant at the time, so hormonal and petty. "
64,Not petty. That's survival instinct kicking in... 
65,"I've read books by men, watched shows, movies, plays written and acted by men, the video games I play are made by and for men. The whole society is geared towards empathizing with men. Also, I am a man myself. Basically, I am not learning anything new on Askmen.


I've mostly lurked Askwomen for a few weeks, and even though I thought I had a fairly strong grasp on modern feminism, gender studies, and even though I grew up around women and my friends are split around 50/50 men and women, I still learned new things and empathized with new type of feelings that I was not aware of. 


I can read things here that women don't talk to men about, either because of fear, or because of shame, or societal pressures, or just because you think it's none of my business, because they're anonymous and (relatively) safe to talk about it.


Askmen cannot not be a circlejerk to me, Askwomen is a learning experience."
66,I bought truck nutz as a gag gift for a buddy once and put them on his C300 (mercedes small 2 door). He didn't see them for like three days and said people were flicking him off all week. Awesome &lt;$20 prank.
67,"Diamonds. Casual dining. The mall. It's all too expensive, not good quality, and often isn't even meant for me as a consumer at all. Maybe cereal? We have a couple of boxes sitting around but we don't buy it very often."
68,"When I was 13 and a not very outgoing girl, my older sibling (28) raped me after a night of drinking with some work buddies. I never told my mom and dad but all my friends at school heard a rumor and started calling me a slut and an incest whore. I was so ashamed I shut down for a few years. Women who have been raped or sexually assaulted will know what this feels like and how it rips your heart apart. At the same time, around 18, I started realizing how the system/government  was allowing a rape culture to be forming in our country. Now that I'm 22 and attending university I feel freedom and empowerment over my rape. Not that it happened, but that I survived it, (and all the negative consequences and feelings of shame that came with it). If I can get through that, I can get through anything. Don't be silent ladies ! Rape is rape is rape and you can be stronger than society ! "

73,*Too many* off-color jokes.
74,"He convinced me to play WoW and said he would help me level my character as long as I picked a certain class. Then he got too busy with his guild to ever help me play, so basically I sat bored at his house trying to play a dumb shallow game while he had fun with his guild for hours on end.

I like RPGs, but solo ones like Morrowind and Skyrim. WoW was boring. "
75,"It depends. If I was at the company for 12months of more i wouldn't say anything about harassment and would instead say that I was looking for a new challenge and this job opportunity was too good to pass up.

I get it, it takes time and effort to trust another person, especially one that you want to impress, but in a relationship, I want to know what's going on in your life, your past, your present. 

Has your father been abusive and you're scared to turn out like him? Have you been bullied in school? Have you done things you regret and beat yourself up about? Are you feeling out of place in your job? Are you scared of losing me? Have I done anything that bothers you? Do you fear getting older, ilnesses, unemployment? You don't have to deal with this alone, that's what partnership is for.

I've dated way to many men who insisted on bottling up everything and then exploded with rage for random reasons because they couldn't take it any longer. And those stupid defense mechanisms like unnecessary jokes help no one. Getting texts like ""Yeah, my new colleagues don't seem to like me lol, why should they, I'm a mass murderer, lol."" is so frustrating. That's not strength, that's insecurity.

Please, acknowledge your emotions and trust me to handle them. We're both just humans and you would support me the same way, wouldn't you?"

Then we got talking and it became obvious that he was really really religious (Muslim). Like really orthodox and staunchly conservative, especially about women's roles. He basically called me out for playing football, since I wore shorts and that was 'immodest'. And since that visibly pissed me off he decided to double down and sent me a long bloody message about how women have magic in their hands and should focus on cooking and playing football was a waste of my god given talents. 

Never mind."

George will tell him to suggest I get a trim. ""She just needs the trim Jerry! One trim away from perfect!"" (Of course that isn't true, but it's how George talks.) 

Kramer suggests Jerry should cut it while I'm sleeping and pretend like he doesn't know what happened when I wake up. ""Snip, snip, it's done!"" he exclaims. Jerry thinks that's a bad idea but he agrees with George and Elaine that he should recommend I get a hair cut, but in a subtle way.

We're on a date and Jerry asks where I get my hair cut as a way of bringing up the subject. I tell him and quickly change the subject but he keeps trying to steer the conversation back to my hair and maybe trying a shorter style. After a few comments about it I get annoyed and ask him if he's trying to control my hair and he says no, of course not, never!

Back from commercial the gang is in Jerry's apartment. George is offended, ""Not even a trim?!"" ""The trim is no good."" Kramer says he knows a guy who will stealth cut it for a price. Elaine with her long hair is starting to get a little uncomfortable. Jerry is frustrated. Kramer has a new invention he wants everyone to try, it's a special gum designed to disintegrate in your mouth around the same time it loses its flavor. 

Jerry and I are watching a movie at his place, he decides to try the gum Kramer left behind. We fall asleep on the couch watching the movie and when I wake up his sticky gum is all over my hair. I accuse him of doing it on purpose because of his ""hints"" about me getting a hair cut and storm out in tears. We're done. ""How could I do it on purpose?

Being young and meek, I didn't want to say he was driving me absolutely fucking insane for like 2 hours so instead I dumped him via text that evening. It was like Chinese water torture, thumb-style.

He would get mad at me for not sleeping with him and I wouldn't sleep with him because he never spent time with me. The fucked up thing is, he quit playing WoW because if was taking over his life and then we started dating. A few months in, his best friend convinced him to come back to the game. I broke up with him pretty soon after that. "

From the enemy being the beauty industry (I get what they're going for, but it's just so trite that that's the only possible enemy a woman could have) to the villain being a woman obsessed with youth (really, again?) to the bonkers acting and hyper sexualization. It's been a long time since I saw it last, so I might be misremembering some things, but I remember when I first saw it not being sure if I should feel pandered to, insulted, or just angry that I'd wasted my money on an objectively terrible movie.

105,"My husband is aware that emotional labor is a thing. He knows I do the lions share, and he knows he needs to do more of it. But he was never trained to do it and though he is willing, often doesn't know how.

So I've been teaching him.

I taught him that making dinner is more than cooking food. He learned to meal plan and shop. I taught him the intricacies, the subtle things like planning to use fresh veggies early in the week and frozen veggies later in the week so that food doesn't rot. We have a large list of meals to choose from with recipes, and I taught him to make several freezable casseroles that are heat and eat. We keep several in the freezer at all times for days when no one wants to cook.

I make lists of everything that needs to be done before guests come to stay, and he tackles half of it. For large events like Christmas, we actually keep the lists from year to year, and he's started adding things to it.

We have a family calendar with dr appointments, anniversaries, birthdays and other events that require coordination on it. He picks up birthday cards if there's a birthday on the calendar that week.

He's learned that when someone is sick or dies, you send food. He'll help me make and deliver the freezable casseroles I taught him to make.

I think it's all about finding someone who realizes emotional labor is work, and that they need to learn to do their share."

It seems like a lot of guys really really care about not crying or being sad or emotional in front of their partners, and that's something that I really don't care about (in a judging them way). I *want* my (hypothetical at the moment :/ ) partner to share those feelings with me and let me know when he's feeling sad or small or needs to cry, because I care a *lot* about his emotional life. It makes me feel shut out when guys hide their stuff from me and sad that they don't want to show me that side of themselves.

I can/will talk about gross stuff with my friends, but in general bodily functions are not something I care to hear about, please no. I think my coworker thought those topics were like shoot-the-shit (heh), bonding-type conversation topics but in reality it just made everyone think he was disgusting. "

He talks to someone and then suddenly we are at some nowhere beach swimming with like 18 manta rays or having someone's grandma's couscous in the back of a shop in Marrakech, and I'm like, how the fuck do you do this? He is fearless and positive. Probably the best day we have had was such a little, perfectly non-extravagant day in Paris. It was February and frosty out so very quiet. Snowing. We had the museums nearly to ourselves. Then a stroll through the flurries in the Tuileries, and hot cocoa at sunset, and it was like being in a snow globe.

* *Sid Meier's Civilization V*, for anyone who likes strategy. The bundle is super cheap.

* Just about anything by Telltale Games. They're more like interactive stories. More specifically, I recommend the first *The Walking Dead* game, *The Wolf Among Us*, and *Tales from the Borderlands*. They're worth checking out even if you aren't familiar with or don't care much for their source material.

* *To The Moon*. It's a short game, but very story rich and heart-wrenching.

* *Psychonauts*. Such an underrated gem.

Every once in a while I’ll (re)notice that I’m the only unmarried one left amongst my longest friendships, except for one girl who I think has a personality disorder and also actively avoids relationships, and that can get depressing, but oh well. I’m dating and trying.

Once, in high school, my group of friends was playing “Never Have I Ever,” and the question was about if you’ve ever had a crush on someone in the group. The cutest guy drank, and I kind of smiled to myself, thinking that he probably had a crush on my super gorgeous BFF. He must have seen me smile, because he came racing over after the game broke up to tell me that he had a crush on my best friend, **not me**, and that’s why he was drinking. That really hurt. It was really unnecessary."

188,"This actually happened to one of my best friends.

When my friend's ex tried to woo her at the beginning, he decided to make her cupcakes. He went onto Google Translate and translated ""Will you be my girlfriend?"" into Chinese.

He presented her the cupcakes with the phrase written on them. He waited for a response. She just stared at the cupcakes. The convo went something like this:


Him: Well?

Her: Well what?

Him: What's your answer?

Her: To what?

Him: Will you be my girlfriend?

Her: You wrote ""You are my woman""...

She is an inspiring figure in a field that was almost completely male in her time and is still male-dominated. She also made important contributions to the investigation of dark matter, which continues today."

He was too poor.

Now, I grew up poor: welfare kid, no shoes in summer, etc. I met him at my first job after high school, in the next town over, and I thought he was great. He smelled a little funny, but not necessarily bad--everyone has their own smell!

We went on several dates, and at the end of one, I drove him home. I really had to pee and asked if I could use his bathroom even though it was four in the morning and he lived with his parents (he had also just graduated). He said yes, and he led me inside.

He turned on the light, and a billion cockroaches SCATTERED. The floor was warped and reeked of piss, the whole place was rotting around them. I don't know how the place was standing. 

He led me through mountains of hoarder shit and his mom stuck up a hand and waved from her multi-boxing WoW setup. They invited me to their DnD group the next week. At the house.

This was following a year and a half of going off of my antidepressants, getting a divorce, suffering a miscarriage and struggling with employment (a one year fellowship expired in September).

I was in a coma for two weeks and in the hospital for 35 days recovering. I never went into inpatient psych care because they felt it was more important that I focus on physical recovery.

I stopped drinking, that helped. I started working from home, that turned out better than I had anticipated and I hope I can keep building on that. 

Otherwise, I don't know. It turned out. My family keeps me honest, I have no/little residual effects, even the scar from my tracheotomy is barely visible. But my life is definitely divided into ""before almost dead"" and ""after almost dead""

It didn't give me a new lease on life, I don't suddenly feel like I'm meant to do something great. I tried, it didn't work, and since it's such a ""sure fire"" method I feel like suicide is just off the table now.

Not drinking any more helps a lot."

We have a fantastic time together and talk almost every day......but he can't stand anything seafood and doesn't like to be in water. It sounds stupid but I realized it would be a problem when we were planning lunch and dinner excursions (we always order menu wide and share everything) and I was bummin hard by having to forgo these amazing looking places because the menu was 70% seafood. And when I couldnt invite him on a river float with my other friends because he doesn't dig the water. Realized as a boyfriend those would both become issues. Momma needs her oysters and beach days.

223,"My daughter got cancer when she was 8- she'd had on and off vomiting for about a month, which I didn't think was that strange as we'd all been a bit sick.  I took her into the hospital as she was starting to look dehydrated, and while she was there a tumour kind of popped out of her abdominal cavity making her look about 7 months pregnant.  Apparently tumours can 'hide' behind intestines and organs, and then kind of come out of nowhere.  We were immediately transferred to a pediatric cancer hospital (excellent place), and for the first 3 weeks that she was there they tried to stabilize her enough for surgery.  Her whole system was out of whack because of the tumour, and it was so large in her tiny frame that ultrasounds,xrays, scans etc. couldn't give us much information except that it was huge.  Because it had grown so quickly they assumed that it was likely advanced cervical/ovarian cancer of some kind, and pretty much told us that we should begin to think of  end of life care scenarios. 

Her surgery was pretty long- they'd told us 4-5 hours, and it ended up being almost 11.  And then the surgeon came bounding out of the room and picked me up and hugged me, and said that she'd be okay.  She did have a dinner-plate sized tumour (9"") in her abdominal cavity, and removed one of her ovaries and fallopian tubes as well as a couple of lymph nodes and a few smaller tumours, but we were pretty much home free.  6 months of chemo, and because her cancer (germ-cell tumour) has a very low recurrence rate, we effectively dodged a bullet.   There's just no moment that compares in my life to finding out that she wasn't going to die.  "

226,"Once upon a time I was pretty fond of casual sex. Here are some things I used to do to stay safe and some things I wish I had done (or done more often) to stay safe.

I religiously took my birth control pill. Same time, every day, no exceptions. I set up an alarm and a backup alarm so that I would never forget.

I kept condoms in my bedroom, truck, and purse. This way no matter where I happened to be or what the situation was, condoms were always nearby.

I frequently checked in at my doctor's office to get tested and make sure everything was all good downstairs.

I always kept my phone charged and kept a spare charger in my vehicle. I also kept change in my purse and my truck (payphones were still a thing). So I was never without a way to call a friend or for help.

I wish I had notified friends of my plans/whereabouts more consistently. I usually told somebody where I was going and who with. However, being young and reckless, there were many times when I'd just disappear for a night out without telling anyone, which was stupid and potentially dangerous.

I wish I had held myself to higher standards. In other words, I wish I had more often listened to that inner voice when it said ""Hey, you're pretty drunk... Maybe you shouldn't do this tonight."" 

I wish I had been more vocal with my partners, not only about their personal health and history, but about my own preferences and needs. I often just went with the flow because it was easier than saying ""Actually, I want this."" or ""I don't like that."" or ""I know you said that you're clean, but how recently did you get checked?"""

About a year and a half later, he called to let me know that he'd gotten married to an old high school friend he reconnected with on Facebook. Still not sure if he reconnected before or after he left.

I was 38 when I met my husband, and at that point I hadn't been in a relationship since high school. I had been on dates, tbh I enjoyed going on dates, getting to know people, being charming. But I wasn't looking for a relationship, not really, until I hit 30, and unfortunately the timing worked out badly because I moved to a place where I was not appealing to men and they were largely unappealing to me. I was on various online dating sites so I didn't give up trying but I was pretty convinced I would be foreveralone. It took some time to reconcile that idea with my hopes for the future, especially that I would not have children (I now have a stepdaughter). I have a number of friends who are still single and I think the main difference is that I enjoyed dating, even when it went terribly. If you hate the process of dating, it can be very hard to meet people at my life stage."

250,"Lol it was a long time ago and I'm embarrassed by how shallow we were. But I will dredge some up. Don't judge younger me, please, but this is the grilling we would give each other whenever a new guy appeared on the horizon:

1. Is he GU (geographically undesirable) = does he live more than a half hour away
2. What's his EP (earning potential) = does he have a job now or is there a potential job in his future?
3. Is he an MM (mother material ie. can he meet your mother) or a BB (bad boy)?
4.  What's his LTP (long term potential) score (out of a potential high score of five)?

... that's all I can remember I should text my old roomies. It was just for fun. 

But we're all married to LTP fives. 

Edit: heard back from my old roommate out west and she reminded me that we also had:

5. BSR = Bathing Suit Ready. This one is dual purpose as it applies to both the guy and oneself.
6. FEP = Future Earning Potential, an extension of EP and to be applied when you don't want to rule out some poor down-on-his luck guy for having no means if he has FEP of any kind. Give a bro a chance. 
7. PLI = Potential Love Interest. Use this one when pondering the PLI factor of a guy you work with, an old friend, dude on your ultimate frisbee team...

Use at will. Usage will help you: form a tight bond with your roommates; keep tabs on what's up in each other's love lives (lifes?); and stay in the loop (even in public places!) without spilling the beans or hurting anyone's feelings. "

he was babysitting his brother when I went over. we all lived in the same apartment complex, so popping in randomly wasn't out of the ordinary. when I got there he said that his brother was still asleep, but I could watch TV with him and his friends. I regret not going home every fucking day of my life. I don't want to get graphic so I'll say he did everything but penetrate me, and I remember him asking his friends if they ""wanted anything"". this event ruined my friendship with his brother, since I didn't want to go over there anymore and when I told him why he called me a liar. I never (and still haven't) told my family. I don't even know if I can consider what happened to me molestation, simply because he was only a few years older than me. 
I deal with it by remembering that people experience much much worse. I can't take back what happened to me but I can help to prevent it from happening to other young girls, and that brings me peace. "

She suffered from polio at a young age, and overcame bullying and introversion to succeed in school. Later in life, a bus accident caused her extreme injuries. These wound up impacting her for the rest of her life, which is evident in her art. Additionally, she was politically active from a young age, and eventually became renowned worldwide as a Chicana Activist/Feminist/Communist.  

This makes her a great role model for women who struggle with chronic illness and disability. It is comforting to me to be able to think of a female icon who overcame physical, as well as social/political, barriers with such grace."
270,"All I can say is that it happened totally by accident. I had thought the situation was hopeless, so I wasn't expecting it. A stroke of good luck, in my opinion."
271,"I was absolutely smitten with this blonde kid in some of my classes but I was EXTREMELY shy and awkward back then so we'd never spoken.  I managed to find his phone number in the school counselor's office and waffled for days about whether to call.  Finally my sister couldn't take it anymore and dialed his number, asked for him, then handed it to me when he came on the phone.  I was like, ""Hey... I'm that girl in your lunch period?  With long brown hair?""

He had no idea who I was, but to his credit for a 14 year old he was very sweet about it.  He urged me to come up to him and say hi at school on Monday.

I spent the entire day trying to will myself to go up and talk to him.  Finally at the very last minute while we were waiting for our buses at the end of the day, I walked up to him and said, ""Hey I'm that girl who called you on Friday.""  He was like, ""Oh, cool, hey, what's up?""  I froze, stammered, stared at the ground, then turned around and walked away and never said another word to him."
272,"Asking the important questions here. I just mentally ran through my palettes and which ones would be breakup worthy. Would probably be ok with the loss of my Electric Palette, but the Nakeds might be too much of a blow."

274,"Oh, a compliment on my eyeliner wings would make my day! A general rule:

Appreciation for things we chose or put effort it (hair, makeup, knowledge, video game skills) : Great, bring it on!

Compliments on things we didn't chose (ethnicity, boobs or other body parts): Creepy and inapropriate.

283,He deserved it.
284,"Holy shit, yes. I'm nice to all my coworkers by default. I'm up for a friendly chat with anyone. But this inevitably results in the socially awkward types glomming onto me because I'm the only woman who'll talk to them (and do all the work of keeping a conversation flowing), so clearly that means we're soulmates!

I feel like I should take a page out of my fellow female coworkers' book and limit interacting with them to what's strictly necessary for work but that seems kind of shitty to me. I'd like to be able to have a friendly conversation with anyone. But every single time I'm able to predict that a guy will develop a crush when I can tell he doesn't get a lot of attention from women."
285,"Caveat: by ""supposed to be feminist but came up short"", I'm going to take ""was supposed to be the most empowered or empowering possible figure but was a miss in some aspect"". This is because ""most feminist"" would ideally mean ""most realistically human"".

I love Buffy, both the show and the character, but Buffy was still fundamentally punished for having sex. That particular treatment always stuck with me as gross. 

Also, I liked the Wonder Woman movie, but I disliked the ""love and innocence wins the day"" theme. I don't like innocence being prized, especially in women. I've heard a lot of people say that the alternative for them is female characters ""originally written as men"", but...I heartily disagree. I'm feminine sometimes, and cynical most of the time. I'm also upbeat and usually optimistic. I don't think either extreme is the most empowering possible portrayal for me."

297,"&gt;Be hot and sexy at all times, but don't you dare act like you realize you're hot and sexy.

This. You're expected to put so much effort into looking hot, but god forbid you actually think you're hot.

A few years ago I was talking to a friend of mine who had recently been approached by a model scout. As she was weighing the pros and cons of a modeling career she said ""I know I could do it, I mean *I know I'm pretty*."" She said it as casually as one would say ""I had salad for lunch today."" 

I was taken aback by the fact that she admitted it out loud. It made me realize how rare it is for women to comment on their own appearance in a non-critical manner. I remember thinking, *whoa, it's possible to think of yourself as pretty?! That's a thing people do?!*"
298,"I'm always charmed by the flirty type. Whether it's the 'lovable rogue' type in fiction or the 'cheeky chap' type in real life.

Maybe we are supposed to provide just a few bad girls to sleep with all the guys until those guys decide they want to get married and then maybe the good girls are allowed to sex?"
306,"Well, I know there are women out there who would disagree with me about this, but how big their muscles are and how big their penis is. Both of those things are quite literally not important to me in terms of my attraction towards them, whatsoever. 

Also whether or not they're rich. What I care about is that you can support yourself and aren't struggling to just get by. This is very different than only wanting to date someone who makes a lot of money. As long as you can support *yourself*, how much money you make is irrelevant to me.

He works ridiculous hours, has a 2 year old and his place is small with not enough storage, so I make some allowance, but now that I am staying there much more due to work, I've had to come out and say I need his place to be cleaner, and it took him totally by surprise. 

I don't mind doing it myself (in fact I find it quite satisfying) but when I know the stuff all over the kitchen has been there for 3 days it makes me feel a bit disappointed that he's happy to live in squalor."
313,"My baby sister being born! I was 12 at the time and I had been waiting for 8 years to be a big sister. Prior to her birth, my mother miscarried 3 times (twice in the second trimester) and got really sick whenever she was pregnant (basically she was always on bedrest).

My sister was born at 25 weeks, weighing less than 2 lbs and had to get a surgery on her heart at 3 days old to close up/remove her ligamentum arteriosum (prior to babies being born- the heart functions as one way pump, not two. Both chambers contain oxygenated blood that gets pumped throughout the body and the deoxygenated blood returns to the mother via the umbilical cord. The ligament along with the fossa ovalis, which is basically a hole connecting the two atria together, allows for blood to travel to both sides of the heart, however it needs to close after birth because otherwise deoxygenated and oxygenated blood mix). She had to spend 3 months in the NICU, before coming home and the first few years were a struggle making sure she hits every developmental milestone.

She's now a happy, healthy, kind, intelligent, creative, funny, and just overall wonderful 10 year old and my best friend. Her birth was just the start of how much I have grown to love and appreciate her over the years but that day I can say was truly the happiest moment I can pinpoint in my life."

320,"Can confirm. Was always unsure about my exes mates. One (married) would regularly sleep with a prostitute. They all made repeatedly poor life choices and had extremely dysfunctional personal relationships. I chose not to judge my ex on that basis but he turned out to be a cheater too.

330,"I went to the wedding of a good friend of mine. They had the standard toasts like the best man and maid of honor. However, after those toasts finished they left the mic open in case anyone else had anything to say.

Big mistake.

See, the couple were very active in our church and were very sociable and outgoing and had impacted a lot of people positively in their lives. And it seemed like three quarters of the attendees felt the need to stand up at the mic to tell them this in a rambling and unprepared manner. 

And it was a very large wedding. 

It's been a few years and I cringed hard enough to block exactly what he said from my memory but one guy said something wildly inappropriate. Something along the lines of how heartbroken he was after a recent breakup, or maybe mentioning that he used to have a crush on the bride? Something like that. It's been awhile.

By the time all of the 'toasts' were completed the bride and groom barely had enough time to have their first dance before needing to leave.

It was a decent idea, in theory. "

342,"This is always interesting to me because in my mind the opposite is a yellow flag. In my experience, guys who've had casual/friendly relationships with their exes have had better approaches to relationships in general.

Of course, I'm talking about very casual contact. Someone talking to their ex on a daily basis would be a yellow flag for me, too."

And I even wanted to talk over the phone. He had bad reception, but we still tried. It was 10 seconds of 'hey can you hear me' until we were disconnected, but he wanted to try. It meant a lot. Just small things without being dismissive.     "
351,"- The Sims 3 since it and all its DLC are super discounted and I wouldn't buy it at any other time

- Stardew Valley, super relaxing, so peaceful and nice, one of my favorite games ever

- Life is Strange, SO heartbreaking, such a tough game emotionally to play but 100% one of the best games I've EVER played

- This War of Mine, make sure you get the donation DLC. Heartbreaking, tough, and a sobering depiction of warfare

- Endless Legend if you like Civ-type games but want something a little tougher but not quite as hellishly difficult as EUIV

- Don't Starve plus all DLC. The artwork is delightfully Burton-esque and all the characters are ridiculously fun to play in their own ways. I played it when it first came out and still play it to this day

- All the Fallout games because sometimes FPS games are just stupid fun. Especially New Vegas though because it's only $2.49 but the storyline in that one is PRIME. Fallout 3 is kind of short but great in its own way, Fallout 4 is mildly disappointing story-wise but the map is big and it's actually sort of difficult and I really enjoy the settlement building.

Anywho, Monday is our trash day so bottles and stuff go out to the curb Sunday. If I want to do something at a reasonable time on Sunday, I time putting the bottles out because in our state there is a refund for them ($0.10, so if you get a whole neighborhood's worth, that could easily be $50/ week), and people go around the neighborhood and collect them, and damn they're fast! So I want him to wake up at 10? Bottles out at 9:45 and the CLANKETY-CLANK-CLANK of the bottles being taken will do the trick... he can't blame me for waking him, and AFAIK, he hasn't caught on.

I met up with him one day after I had a job interview and he said I was dressed so nice that he wanted to take me out to a fancy restaurant. When the bill came, he used his watch calculator to tell me how much I owed. I was unemployed, hence the job interview. I would've been happy with a trip to McDonald's, which was actually in my price range. After dinner, I drove us back to his house, where he lived with his grandparents. (we were only 19 so this wasn't a deal-breaker) He introduced me to his sweet little grandmother, then we went to hang out in his bedroom - with the door open. He kept trying to make out with me, which was awkward since Grandma was just down the hall, but when he said ""are you going to have sex with me or not?"" I was gone."

373,"Dumb societal stereotypes that women are more organized and responsible than men, in my opinion. In the media, men are often represented as spontaneous and comfortable, while women are the ones doing all the sorting/organizing/structuring of the home and relationship. They make it seem like this is because women are either neurotic or demanding, but that's not the case. Stuff needs to get done, and the best vacations are the ones where you have *actual things to do*. It should be a joint process, but by stepping out entirely, men don't have to take responsibility for whatever happens if the plans go wrong. Our society totally enables and promotes this stereotype by having the women be the ""naggy obnoxious ones"" that always end up messing something up because of their crazy effort."
