0,"There was a thread about putting your child up for adoption posted on Mother's Day I wanted to respond to, but my situation seemed too sad and out of place to post.

I found out I was pregnant when I was 19. It was during a rape kit after being assaulted by my boyfriend's father. I probably should've known I was pregnant, but I thought the nausea was the result of drinking and my eating disorder. I cried while in stirrups and the nurse gave me this list of phone numbers to clinics without saying a word. Ultimately I could not afford an abortion on my own and my boyfriend, Will, said he would leave me if I even considered it. He was my everything and I imagined that picturesque American Dream of us being a family.

Honestly, I hated being pregnant. I hated losing control of my body, I hated the stretch marks, I hated the weight gain. I wasn't ready and didn't want that fucking thing inside me. Will was always drunk and it took a black eye for me to realize there was no family. Fortunately he agreed to give our daughter up for adoption.

We went through this agency that gave us their ""family scrapbooks."" Most of them were weird but we did find this single woman who fostered shelter dogs, owned her own business, and owned a home by a lake. She looked like my sister and when I met her she was so kind.

I spent roughly 24 hours with Lydia before I said goodbye. Almost immediately after delivery, seeing her out of me, I said out loud that I couldn't do this. I held her while she cried, I cried too, I could never give her what she needed.

Will and I signed the adoption papers in the hospital. The adoptive mother's mother wanted a picture of us for documentation or whatever. We are both sitting on a hospital couch with forced smiles and tears running down our faces.

I broke up with Will months later. It was supposed to be an open adoption, but I stopped getting any updates after Lydia's first birthday. She turns 10 this year. Her mom has a Facebook that posts a new photo of Lydia every couple of years or so and she is so damn happy and pretty. I've considered reaching out to her mom on there, but there's a risk she doesn't want me involved and I'd just be blocked and never see Lydia again at all. I never want to be pregnant again. I hate being around babies and young children. The whole experience was the worst year of my life and I don't wish it upon anyone. "
1,I was wearing my white pants since I was menstruating and wanted to show my tampon's effectiveness.  So I celebrated with my salad.  She was hilarious!

3,"Even after living there for a while, I could never get used to **universal care**. It felt like I was getting away with a crime.

What do you mean I can *just leave?* What about this medication? I can *just take it home?* Why do you care about me getting well *more than paperwork or payment*? Are you *sure* I'm not going to jail for this?

4,"Dated a guy off and on 8 years. He was amazing. Great friend to everyone he knew. We took a break while he was in grad school. He ended up dying in a fire before the end of that year. 

That was 6 years ago and I still have nightmares sometimes. "
5,"Hi! I'm mixed! If you see/hear something SAY SOMETHING! And really don't just do it for 'some' people do it for everyone; everyone deserves defending. If you hear someone disparaging someone else say something. Also no single person should be judged by the ""stereotype"" of what they are likened to. 

Is someone talking about someones weight? Too Fat, Too thin? Let them know it's not their place. And ask them why they care. 

Is someone using a Slur? Ask them why.

Is someone Mocking a sexuality? Ask them why. 

Make people explain their bigotry. Ask where and why they got their notions. "
6,"I was 16 and in an mentally and physically abusive relationship with a much older man. (He was well into his 20s).   My home life was sh*t so I'm sure that played into all this. 

Anyway I ended up pregnant.  I had no health insurance and no money. BF dumped me to be with his ex and would not take my calls nor give me money.  I had no one to turn to.  I delayed speaking up out of fear and by the time it came out I was 6 months along.

My mom finds out and goes ballistic. She doesn't care that I was being forced. To her I was just a ""dumb slut"" that ruined ""everything"" (Everything would be her putting into an expensive private school we couldn't afford). She woke me up at night to yell at me about the stupid decision I made. I was denied food. Everything I did resulted in an insult. I was accused of doing things I did not do. She had me doing chores that she knew were considered dangerous for pregnant women (heavy lifting, cleaning the kitty litter box)

She then contrives a plan to help me hide the pregnancy which included me wearing spanx-like garments under my clothes, ultra baggy clothing, and staying out of sight from family members that might figure it out. 

I went to the local clinic for prenatal care and at least the doctors were nice. Then it came out that the child had some rare genetic disorder.  The doctors wanted my mom to come in to talk about the results. She refused. They called and yelled at her demanding she come in since I was a minor and she was responsible for me. She came but had a major attitude, which made the situation 200% worse.  I ended up losing a lot of weight while pregnant because I was so stressed out from the verbal abuse and was being denied food. The news about the genetic disorder and trying to stay current with all my school work didn't help either.  It was to the point the doctors were looking to admit me because they thought I was experiencing vomiting and nausea. I didn't tell them I was being denied food or sleep.  

Somewhere between the 7th and 8th month of pregnany I broke down and confided in a classmate I thought was my friend and a teacher.  My friend told the whole school but no one really believed it because I was naturally a fat kid and fat kids don't get male attention. The teacher made me tell the principle and I thought for sure I would be dismissed from the school. I cried and begged them not to put me out of the school. They said they would not dismiss me but if I started showing I may need to consider other options until I have the child. 

At this point I had realized I didn't want the baby and my home wasn't safe for me let alone him so I called an adoption agency.  That was tough because they want health information from you and the grandparents and my mom would not comply with filling out the forms. Every question was met with anger and insults. 

I go into labor around xmas. I was home begging my mom to take me to the hospital because the labor pains are unbearable. She delays and uses the time to insult me some more. She finally dropped me off at the hospital and never came back.   I delivered alone, no one visited me and when I called my mom the next day to tell her I was ok, she said she didn't care. I had to beg her come pick me up.  She purposely took 3 hours to show up and I was at the point where I was willing to walk the 3 miles home but security prevented me from leaving until someone came and got me

The baby stayed at a hospital in Westchester Medical because there was no adoptive families that wanted a special needs child.  I would sometimes go and visit because I felt obligated to. 

After months of no prospective adoptive families, I took my son home when he was 3 1/2 mo because I felt obligated to try to right the situation  My mom was less than supportive, I couldn't find reliable child care  and my mom refused to babysit or help me at night so my grades went from As to Cs. 

When he was 5 months old I found him dead (cold and blue) in his crib. He died of SIDS sometime during the night.  My mom would not let me call 911, because the ""neighbors might see"" So I had to carry his stiff body to the car, wait for her to drive me to the ER, only for the attending physician tell me the obvious-nothing could be done.  

We had a small funeral and my mom cried and played the grieving grandma card like an academy award winning actress. Other family members showed up confused and bewildered because they had no idea I had a child until the funeral. My dad found out about all this well after the fact (My parents are not together, and I only saw him on weekends) and was really angry at the fact all this was hidden from him. 

 A few months after the funeral I walked the 3 miles along a strip of highway with no clear sidewalks to make sure my son had a headstone. I used the money I received from social security to pay for the headstone(I had to apply since he was born disabled) . 

My sons father knew about the baby-offered no support, when the child died, he told me I killed his son and called me a baby killer, murderer, etc and years later he claimed that I somehow benefited off his son's death.  I stopped all contact after that. Now like clock work every year, he has all these RIP messages  to ""his son"" on FB and does this big production at the grave site.  


TLDR: Pregnant at 16, no ability to abort. Mom finds out when I am 6mo along and proceeds to abuse me.  I tried to give the baby up for adoption, couldn't find a family, so I took him home. He dies of SIDS at 5mo. I am now 36 with no kids. No one knows this story. "

Find what works for you, and cultivate it. Everyone has insecurities. If anyone tries to belittle you for being different, know that they are simply too afraid to stand out. "
11,"Twenty years ago, I was 26, separated from my husband and going through the end stages of a divorce. I was casually re entering the dating scene, but not ready to find love, just to expand my social circle.

A guy I had gone out with once or twice asked me if it was okay to give my number to a friend of his who he thought I'd really like. I agreed and later that same night, my phone rang and I began talking to the most interesting man I had ever met.

He called me every night for a few weeks, he was amazing, but lived an hour away and was busy with grad school. I had a young daughter and was busy adjusting to life as a single parent. In spite of that, we found a time to meet and go out for a date.

He showed up, brought me flowers from his yard, and the chemistry was instant. I fell head over heels at first sight, and I think he did too. He called me the next afternoon, just to make sure I wasn't worried with ""will he call?"".

We kept talking every night and dating when we could find time. Then, he took a summer internship several States away. I was scared about feeling so intensely about someone because I wasn't divorced yet and having married young, I wanted to learn about being single. I just wasn't ready to trust someone again and he wasn't in a place to offer the things I needed.

After his internship, we continued taking over the phone and via email. I dated other people and so did he. He became more tied up with grad school and I was busy with my life as well.

He graduated and moved out of state for his job. I began a relationship with someone else and so did he. We still stayed in touch and continued the friendship. 

After many years of talking and visiting when we were both single and he was home visiting family, he fell in love with someone and became engaged. This broke my heart more than it should have because I couldn't imagine him wanting to spend his life with someone who wasn't me. I realized that I couldn't have a real love relationship with anyone because I was still in love with him. That it had always been him. So, I decided that for both our sakes, we had to cut contact. I wished him all the happiness in the world.

Being without him was hard and hurt so deeply. People told me that time would heal, and it did, but left a deep empty spot in my heart. I dated and even tried having relationships. But I couldn't get serious or make a long term commitment because somewhere in the back of my mind I thought that it should be him.

Four years of no contact and I was struggling in a weird situation in my life. My daughter was 19 and moving out on her own. In a moment of desperation about my life, I got on my knees and prayed for God to show me where I was supposed to be in my life. I hadn't been very religious, but I just felt so lost and in desperately wanted to be found.

The next day, my phone rang and it was him. I don't know how he managed to find my number. I believe he contacted a mutual friend via Facebook. He told me that he always loved me, that he didn't go through with the marriage and asked me to run away with him. 

I was happy and terrified. But the idea of uprooting my life and running away to Chicago, from my small town life in Virginia was too much. I told him I couldn't do it for just a ""move in with me baby"". That I wanted the fairy tale. I needed Prince Charming on a horse. 

After some soul searching and tough decisions, I sold most of my stuff, packed a suitcase. He rented a Mustang convertible, which was the closest thing he could get to a mighty steed, and drove down to rescue me.

We took the long way back to his home, spending a few days along the way to get reacquainted. It's been four years and we are still so very happy. We've had some bad thing happen in both of our lives, but we've faced them together. We are a complete team and love and support each other everyday.

He was the one that got away, but he didn't stay away forever. "
12,"Great question!! I don't have a lot of time but here's the short version. I was brutally raped by my ex boyfriend on my 18th birthday and got pregnant. I wanted an abortion, there was no doubt about it. Unfortunately, I couldn't afford one and at the time I didn't know there was funding available for my situation. I also didn't have a car so would need a ride and all that.


I asked everyone I knew if I could borrow the money, and nobody would help me out. One friend had the money and was going to lend it to me, but her boyfriend told her he would break up with her if she did (oh, high school).


Eventually I told my parents and asked them for the money. They said no (and honestly they wouldn't have been able to afford it even if they wanted) and were weirdly excited about a potential grandkid even though I was STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL, although my mom did say she would go with me to get the procedure done. 


Somehow, the ex boyfriend's parents found out and fucking *flipped*. They demanded a meeting at their house with me and my parents, where they insisted I go stay with a distant relative, carry the baby to term, and give it away. During this meeting, when I said I wanted an abortion, my mom acted like that was the first time she'd heard that and said she would absolutely not accompany me to something ""like that"". That was incredibly painful for me. 


Long story short, under extreme pressure from my parents and no resources of my own, I had the kid and kept him (he's 10 now). He's an awesome kid and I love him a lot, but I've never truly felt like a mother. He lives with his dad and stepmom and two little brothers about 5 hours away from me. I see him on holidays and a couple times throughout the summer. Don't get me wrong, I fucking love that kid and he's awesome, I've just never felt like I was cut out to be a mother, and embracing mom life never came naturally to me. 


I've felt a lot of shame and guilt about it over the years, but I'm at peace with it now. Feel free to judge me, I won't be bothered. "
13,"As with most things, it  depends on the circumstances."

17,"My mom had her first child at 17. She was still a senior in High School. She put her daughter up for adoption because she knew that she could not provide the life that her daughter deserved. She has said many times that it was the hardest decision she ever had to make. She went on the get married and have 3 more kids, the youngest being me.

My sister's adoptive family never lied to her about her parentage. She and her brother always knew they were adopted. When my sister turned 18, she decided she wanted to find her birth mother. She took to Facebook. She found someone with the same last name who lived in the same area as her birth mother and asked if she was related. That person was our cousin. My parents told my other siblings and I that we had another older sister and our mom went to meet her.

My oldest sister is now about 33 and she has two little girls of her own. She calls my mother almost every day on her way home from work. We don't get to see them often because she lives on the other side of the country, but we talk on Facebook quite often. She and her family are coming up to visit soon, so we will get to see them for the first time in over two years.

My mom still has a hard time with it sometimes. When she first gave my sister up, she was told that they would have no problem placing such a ""perfect baby girl"". My sister was in foster care for about two years before she was placed with the family that raised her. Mom often wonders what that time was like for her baby. My sister was young enough that she doesn't remember any of it. She thanks our mom for what she did. She knows that it was done out of love and that her life would be completely different if she had grown up with the rest of us. She would never have met her husband. She would never have had her children. The rest of us probably wouldn't exist because it is hard for a 19 year old to date when they have a toddler running around.

Whenever you have a hard time with it, remember that your decision was made out of love and you will be okay."
18,"&gt; he lives with his dad

The...rapist?"
19,"Aw OP, you're not alone, this happened to me too. It was incredibly painful and I was upset about it for years. But don't blame yourself for it - you can't recognise people like that until you have some experience, and even after that, liars and manipulators aren't always easy to spot. It's not your fault, and you're not devalued by it. It's okay to be upset too, it's natural if you really value intimacy. I felt a pressure to pretend I didn't care and pretend I could just brush it off, so I repressed it, and I think that's what made me so slow to get over it. I was manipulated, lied to and betrayed by someone I cared about, and that's a big deal! It's ok to feel devastated, accept your feelings and look after yourself. Better things and better people are coming in future ❤ after this you'll find it easier to recognise someone who's not good for you, it's just such a shame that we usually have to learn this the hard way through a painful experience. Your next relationship will 100% be an upgrade."
20,"""You touch my penis with respect"" after a not too fast hand job."
21,"Yep. He sued me for custody and won. His grandfather was a judge in our small town and his family was very well to do.

25,"It's the private/public expectation dichotomy.

There's a number of dudes who think you're gross if you don't shave every inch of your body often enough that you don't have stubble.

Sometimes those same dudes will get mad at you if you ask them not to wear jeans with holes in them to a baby shower.

Women at least tend to be more internally consistent with their grooming expectations.  Like, person who puts hours into grooming who wants you to do the same.  And their expectations are more like ""please wear clean clothes so that my friends and family don't think you're a fucking slob"" and less ""please me sexually with your lack of leg hair""."
26,His work. He's a software engineer. All the technical stuff just goes over my head. He explains it to me really well but without any context I just can't really grasp it. I pick up on key words and companies he works with and certain product names but I don't really understand it on a conceptual level.
27,"I didn't have the money for an abortion - I was broke, sleeping on my friend's couches, didn't have a car or a job. The father (whom I'd been dating for ~2 months) said he'd pay. He didn't. I was miserable. I had violent morning sickness until I was 5 months, like 7-10x a day, which hindered my ability to find a job. The father wanted the child so adoption wasn't an option. He was an alcoholic mess, he never would have successfully raised a child on his own. I was still planning to leave the child with him. Then I had preeclampsia and a c-section. I didn't bond with my son at all in the hospital but he ended up coming home with me to my grandmother's house. Dad didn't get paternity leave and had no help. That first night at ""home"" with my son, I hobbled to him in the middle of the night and fed him and realized this was mine. He was my responsibility, I brought him into the world and needed to be responsible for this little 5 pound baby because no one else would. 

He's 6 now. He's low functioning autistic. I still wouldn't change anything. He's my main source of happiness in life, as someone who has had clinical depression for over a decade. He's a sweet, affectionate, bright child and my main motivation to better myself in life.  "

29,"My first ever boyfriend at 18! 


He took my virginity, lied to me about his name, his age (he said he was 22, then 26 but was actually in his 30's) he lied and said he was single but he was married. When I confronted him he lied and told me ""he had told me he was married"" lol no...he told me he lived with his ""aunt"". He refused to use a condom and didn't care if I was on any birth control (because he had given me false info and could just disappear if I got pregnant). I paid for hotels, meals etc. 


The only reason I found out was because Facebook ""randomly"" brought up his profile which had a different name but same pictures.

Sometimes he talks about certain beers or wines, and I just cannot for the life of me relate to his interest. But I like to see him happy about things, so I listen and try to understand."
32,"In China, from Canada. I will never get used to seeing kids poo/pee in the streets. The first time I saw it I was really disgusted and thought it was a one off, but nope it's very common for younger kids. 

Also, how acceptable it is to make phone calls or browse on your phone during a movie. "
33,"True. One of my good friends just went through a divorce and it was a heartbreaking experience for all of them. Especially for the kids who are having a really hard time dealing with the breakdown of their family. 

There was no cheating or abuse that led to the divorce, just a falling out of love and general unhappiness. The news that they couldn't work things out has been difficult for their family and close friends as well, so I can't imagine how a divorce party would be seen as a positive thing by anyone. Unless they host it together, the one hosting the party would be perceived as insensitive and callous by everyone else. Their children in particular would be tremendously hurt by one of their parents celebrating an event that is causing them so much misery.

On the other hand, I have a friend who divorced an abusive, barely employed POS, who made her life and those of her kids miserable. He also made the divorce process as painful as possible by trying to squeeze as much money out of her as he could. She didn't have a party right after the divorce came through. But if she had, all of her friends would've happily attended and celebrated with her.

So yeah, context matters when it comes to divorce parties."

37,Some random dude at the store told me the back of my knees were smokin' hot.
38,"I'm not so sure If my story can be considered a part of this but here goes. 

I was 17 when an ex showed up for my best friends birthday on a shiny new motorcycle. He offered me a ride on it and of course I said yes. 

He told me he was taking me to his friends house to hang out. I wasn't up to it much but said okay anyways. Little did I know, it was an hour away. It started to get late and I asked him to take me home. He refused. I thought he was joking... he wasn't. 
We (unsuccessfully) slept in a park, a football stadium and around 4 am he snuck me into his parents home. (Before you ask, I did not have a phone to call anyone. ) 
I didn't want to have sex. I wanted the night to be over. I wanted to go home. We weren't together. He forced himself on me. I said no. I pushed him off. Etc. nothing worked and I was too tired to fight back anymore. I let him have his way.I was on birth control. That morning i went to get the morning after pill around 10 am. 

 3 months later I found out I was pregnant. 
I was terrified. I wasn't ready. I wanted an abortion. 
When I finally told my mom, she said she would disown me if I did. She convinced me not to do it. Plus, I didn't have the funds. 

She's 5 years old now and beautiful. Friday I'm taking her father back to court to get child support and majority of custody. 

Sometimes I still feel resentment for him taking my life away from me. Others I'm very grateful to have raised such a wonderful little girl.

39,Probably Heath Ledger. I think his story of why and how he died is pretty sad.  
40,"My favorite fuckboy: We met on OkCupid and had a really great conversation. He seemed like someone I would want to be friends with, possibly more in the romantic department. He invited me for coffee in the middle of the day.

He was nothing like the man he was on OkCupid. He asked me question after question. I kept trying to turn each answer into a two-way conversation, but his response was to keep firing off more questions. After about 30 minutes he looks into my coffee cup and says, ""Are you done????""

""....um.....yeah."" He then asked me if I wanted to go play boardgames with his roommates. My eyes rolled so hard that I saw stars. He was hot, so I said sure. We walked for 20 minutes in the 90-degree heat to his apartment. 

Surprise, surprise! There was nobody there. He took me on a quick tour of the house, and then sat down on his bed. ""What do you want to do now?""

I laughed and sat down next to him. We had a very quick romp that didn't include much foreplay. Once he was done, he said ""I have a meeting in an hour and I need to shower. Do you remember how to get back to town?""

At this point, I was frustrated. Looking like a mess, I walked back to town in the 90-degree heat and promptly deleted his number.

The next week, I was on a first date with someone I ended up dating for 2 years. I had lost my contact in the restaurant and we were taking the bus to my place so I could pick up my glasses and then come back to town for a moonlight walk.

The asshole came walking up to us and said, ""quirky_euphist, what are you doing?"" I replied, ""Oh hey, Tim. I'm on a DATE. How are you?""

We got on the bus and there were only 3 seats left, very close to each other. We rode the 10 minutes to our stop in silence.

He texted me later, like ""WHO THE FUCK WAS THAT"". He still occasionally texts me in the middle of the night...It's been almost 6 years."
41,"I got pregnant when I was 19 and my choices boiled down to: keep him and drop out of college, or give up him up. 

I never considered abortion; I have family friends who have adopted and I've heard of their struggles finding a child, and so I knew that if I couldn't take care of him the way I wanted there would be so many other families who could. 

I spent some time in a ""pregnant home"" which was basically a community for pregnant teens who for one reason or another didn't want to or couldn't be around family. 

After going through stacks and stacks of prospective families, I finally found the perfect one. They were everything I could have asked for in a family, and had the means to give him the life I wasn't able to at that point in time. 

I loved being pregnant. The bond you create with the child during pregnancy was something I never even knew existed. I had a tough pregnancy, bad symptoms, the thing where you are allergic to your kid and itch all the time, but it was still so incredible to me. Incredible feeling him moved and his little feet on my stomach. 

There was this weird duality to the pregnancy where I was bonding with him but I knew he wasn't mine? It's hard for me to describe. I think because I knew from the start I couldn't give him the life he deserved I didn't have as hard of a time letting him go, but it was still super difficult. 

Childbirth sucked (duh) but the three days I was in the hospital afterwards with him I will cherish forever. It was like...those three days I could pretend he was mine, you know? The nurses treated me like the mother, he slept with me on my chest, it was like my own little haven. 

And then, the family came to get him. They let me stay with them for as long as I wanted afterwards, but the illusion was broken. He wasn't mine. Not anymore. I stayed as long as I needed to to recover from the c section, and then I called my mom to pick me up. 

I still see him about once a year. He's exactly like me. He has my personality and my traits, even though he doesn't spend real time with me. It's really crazy. He looks just like me too. Has the same mannerisms and same looks I used to get. 

He's turning ten this year and I can't wait to see him again for his birthday. I'm at a point in life now where I'm married and my husband and I are starting to talk about kids of our own. 

Mother's Day is always really hard for me though. No one recognizes birth mothers because we aren't ""real mothers"" and I totally get that. We didn't stay up late with them when they were sick. We didn't teach them to ride a bike. We didn't change their dirty diapers. We didn't do all of the things mothers usually do. But there's still something, right? And that something doesn't get acknowledged.

- If you hear people talking down about how Black girls are ugly or if they're making racist jokes, please call them out. I have been the only Black person in a group and have had someone shout the N-word and had to awkwardly laugh it off because I wanted to avoid the angry Black woman stereotype.
- If I say I'm uncomfortable about a joke, even if we're playing a game like Cards Against Humanity, don't fucking say that I'm too sensitive over the joke. Yes, the cards have crude jokes but you don't have to make racist jokes/remarks on top of them. Playing the ""monkey president"" card and then saying ""Well, I can say that about Black men"" is still racist and I'm allowed to be offended.
- If someone is talking about issues within the Black community whether it's Affirmative Action or police brutality or any major ""issue"", it'd be nice to call out your relatives when they say racist things. Sitting still and looking pretty doesn't really help."

51,"It was one of those summers where bees were everywhere and the sun was hot and oppressive in the sky. 

I was young, and working my very first job, as a cotton candy girl at the state fair. My work apron made me look even shorter, pudgier, though I wasn't fat yet, back then. And my work hat slid down in my eyes, no matter how tightly I adjusted it, far too big. I was little, back then, with golden curls and big blue-green eyes, and I know I looked innocent and young as a girl possibly can. 

I worked the front of the booth, cotton candy and register, sometimes with a coworker during peak busy time, but mostly just me. 

He worked the back of the booth. Popcorn, corn dogs, nachos, not that we sold many nachos. 

The work uniform did him all sorts of favors. Where it drowned me, it just emphasized his long limbs, his sharp collar bone. He wore a plain white t-shirt underneath, dark jeans, and he'd start every morning immaculate clean, smelling of soap and laundry and a little bit like fryer oil, pretty much always, from spending all day at it. 

He had the coolest blue eyes, and until I saw him glare at someone grabbing my co-worker, I really didn't know what ""steely eyes"" meant. His were the very definition of it, and when he looked at me, sometimes it just gave me chills. 

And the work hat, it kept his silky blond hair back, so when he took it off, it was all flattened and silly looking, and he'd ruffle his hand through it, and I wanted to do nothing more than do that myself, because it looked touchable soft. 

He was the kind of tall and slender that I like - over six feet, and maybe five inches around, a sort of Jack Skellington build that fascinated me. He moved really fluidly, graceful, which was weird for a guy that tall at our age. Most of them were still kind of gawky, but not him. 

He treated me like I was something made of glass, or maybe the way you'd carry around a little treasure. He'd hover nearby, lingering, and always drift closer, not like he wanted to, but like he couldn't resist. And then, as soon as I noticed, he'd draw away, scowling, and we fought viciously about it, sometimes, because when were were talking, or alone together, when he wasn't fighting it, and I wasn't, we got on like bees in sugar, which, if you've never worked a cotton candy booth, I gotta tell you pretty much go hand in hand. 

He said I was the kind of good girl that goes to college, gets a real job, marries someone nice, and has a ton of babies. He was a carnie, and a drifter, and he'd never be able to give me the kind of life I deserved. 

I didn't care. But he did. A lot. 

One time, it was late, like, really late, and we still had an hour of work before closing, and the rain had emptied out the fairgrounds, but the lights were all still going, turning the water into glowing halos, a kind of rain-sparked fireworks  all around us. I was bored, and yammering, and he was in the back, cleaning up early so when closing time came, we could get out earlier than usual. 

I just remember the way he turned and looked at me, his eyes narrow and as steely as can be, his jaw hard set, and he just wrapped his hands around my shoulders and neck - his thumbs toughing at the base of my neck, his fingers wrapped all the way down to my collar bone, not choking, but not soft, and he pushed me into the wall of the booth, through bags of cotton candy, up against the plexiglass, and our eyes met, and we just both stood there, frozen by the chemistry and the heat and contact - the touch. We never touched, and I know I could feel real fireworks going off in my chest, and if the look in his face was indication, so could he. 

We had chemistry. Sparks. And we stood there, both of us scarcely breathing, neither moving, until a customer came up and asked for a monster bag of cotton candy.

He was practically halfway across the booth in fractions of a second, like lightening. 

He didn't say a single word the right of the night. But he kept looking at me, and his expression was that thoughtful, lost kind of look he'd get sometimes. 

Once, earlier in the fair, I was spinning two machines at once, and our newbie helper was up on the register, and he was working in the back, and I was absolutely swamped, my hands chapped near to bleeding from the stinging hot molten sugar being spun out of the head of the machine, and I was just drowning in the busy. I was struggling to keep up with the crazy crowd, and he took over a cotton candy machine for me. He slipped up behind me, and took the second cotton candy stick, and our hands brushed, and it was like the whole world took a breath. Just, having him there, knowing he had my back, it made it all feel a lot more doable. 

He stayed there, spinning with me until the crowd died down. I hadn't known he could even spin cotton candy, until then, but he was really good. He was fast, and efficient, and calm, and all the things I needed him to be in that moment.

He was always looking out for me. He was undeniably drawn to me. But he was, in his mind, just a carnie. I don't think he realized how amazing he was. Calm under pressure, funny, smart about things I had no idea about, like car engines and electrical wiring. 

I wish I'd been able to convince him that the chemistry, the sparks, the way we seamlessly fit when we weren't fighting it was worth risking all the things he was afraid of for, but I couldn't. He wouldn't. And it's probably the thing I regret most about my entire life. There's nothing that even comes close. "

55,"Throwaway account for privacy concerns

I got pregnant when I was 16 years old. I grew up in an extremely conservative and religious household, so when I found out, I knew I couldn't keep it, but I felt like there was nowhere I could go and no one I could talk to. I felt so terrified and alone. I did some research and found out that in my state, you need parental permission to get an abortion if you're under 18. You can have the permission waived by a judge, but this felt very far from feasible, as I lived in a small town and my family was very close friends with the only judge in our county. On top of that, I wasn't sure of the process this required and I couldn't have possibly afforded a lawyer with my part time minimum wage job. I kept the pregnancy a secret from everyone except the baby's father, who desperately wanted me to keep it. I bandaged my stomach and put on a corset every day before school. I tried everything to try and make myself miscarry: I rammed my stomach into the corners of walls, I rubbed peppermint oil on my skin, I drank weird concoctions and teas I found online.  Nothing worked. As the pregnancy progressed, I became more and more frightened. I realized that I had already passed the point for a legal abortion, and I panicked. I found the RU486 being sold online from a sketchy website based in India. I ordered it and had it shipped to my boyfriend's house, out of fear of my parents finding it. I took the pills and started feeling extremely sick. I ran into my mom's room, sobbing, and told her that I needed to go to the ER. Once I got to the hospital, they gave me medicine to stop the contractions, but it didn't help. I ended up giving birth to a baby much larger than I expected. He was completely blue and didn't cry. He lived for 30 minutes before suffocating due to his undeveloped lungs. The nurse brought me the birth certificate and death certificate to sign at the same time. 

It killed me to see my baby like that. It killed me to have to go back to school and pretend that everything was okay. No one even knew that I was pregnant, how was I supposed to tell them how devastated and traumatized I was? I bottled everything up, and it sent me spiraling into a very deep depression. I became addicted to prescription drugs and was committed to a mental hospital twice for suicidal thoughts and self harm. I would never wish that sort of pain on anyone. "

It's also reflected in the decor. Houses here are decorated so coldly and sterile too. This is great in the summer but I live in coastal NSW and it gets cold here during the winter. It is colder inside my apartment in the winter than it is outside. I have to wear huge thick pj's and a blanket at all times inside. I have never been so cold since moving here. People just put up with being freezing inside there own homes because there is no insulation and nobody has central heating. It's bizarre. People question how an Irish girl can be so cold all the time but I am just not used to how well ventilated houses are.

One of my childhood best friends got pregnant in college, when she was 22. She hadn't been dating the guy that long, and when she found out she started trying to gather money for an abortion. A month passed and she still didn't have enough, so she finally went and asked her mom, who was/is really harsh and unsupportive.

Her mom loaned her the last bit of money she needed, and she was able to make an appointment with a clinic, but when she got there she found out she was more pregnant than she'd thought, and in fact had moved past the 20th week, and the clinic turned her away.

She decided to keep the baby and try to make it work with the father. By the time her daughter was born, she and the father had split up. She had to drop out of school and get two part-time jobs to afford an apartment. Her family as expected gave her no support at all. 

But when her daughter was 3 she was able to start attending night classes at a community college. After a few years, she got her degree in elementary education this way, and was able to get a full-time job teaching pre-K. Her daughter is 8 years old now, and she loves her, and she's really happy to be a mom, but she also realized that dating is a crock of shit and she doesn't want any more kids. 

She made it all work for her eventually, but obviously it derailed her life in a big way, and required her to sacrifice a lot of things in order to support something she never really wanted to begin with."

82,"Yeah. It was at a bus stop years ago. 

At the time I was like a 22-year-old punk rock girl with a mohawk and these six-inch platform boots. I was waiting for a bus downtown. Then this guy walks up; probably in his late 30s or early 40s, wearing a cheap navy blue suit, he appeared to be maybe Arab and had a moderate accent. That's all I know about him. 

He wasn't super handsome or anything and we were clearly very different people, but I swear to god I had the weirdest experience. And clearly, so did he. It was just like... as soon as I saw him, I *knew* him somehow.

So we just stood there smiling at each other, but not saying anything, because what would we say? Finally, he goes ""um, do you know when the bus comes?"" I said ""no, sorry."" 

And then we just stood there right next to each other, but not touching, and I felt this incredible sense of connection. It wasn't like sexual, even. It was just... peaceful. It really did feel like I knew this person in a way I could not explain, and was at home with him. 

When the bus came it was mostly empty, but we sat down together. We didn't say anything the whole trip, but we just kept looking at each other and smiling. But like in a slightly quizzical way, because we were clearly both trying to figure out wtf was going on. 

My stop came and I said ""well, this is me."" He smiled at me and said ""maybe I'll see you on here again someday."" I smiled and left. As the bus pulled away we watched each other go. He waved. 

This is over 10 years ago now but I think about it a lot. It was one of the strangest interactions of my life. I never did see him again, but I rarely took that bus. "

It's soul and mind crushingly depressing.

I was going through a divorce at the time from my spouse having a mental breakdown and ending up in the hospital from trying to commit suicide. He tried cutting his wrists in front of me many times because he said, ""You hate me so much, maybe this'll make you happy.""

I found out I was pregnant shortly after he decided to move everything he owned out of the apartment. I was told from a young age that I was not going to ever be able to have children due to a half formed uterus. I was already starving trying to afford our apartment on only my own money. After I called the Planned Parenthood in my city, I couldn't afford a medical abortion and still eat, but made too much money to qualify for assistance. So I waited. I picked up as many shifts as I could and saved up a quarter of the money I would need for an abortion from a clinic nearly four hours away. When I made the appointment, I thought I still had a couple weeks left to get the abortion. I made plans for the drive, borrowed my mother in law's credit card to pay for medical bills and told her I had to have some test for my heart that my insurance wouldn't pay for even though it was ""medically necessary"". (She was a heavily religious baptist. So I lied. She didn't blame me for anything going on with her son and still treats me like her own daughter almost 7 years later.)

I made the drive alone and drove past the line of protestors to the clinic. Had them scream and yell at me from the sidewalks as I walked in. I was frisked and emptied my pockets and left my purse in the car. Abortion clinics are dangerous places. I had to be examined and shown all the requisite materials and listen to the baby's heartbeat and come back the next day. 

In the examination room I was told I was farther along than I had originally calculated and they could not legally help me.

My ex-spouse and I ended up giving up the baby through an adoption agency that helped me pay bills and feed me through my eighth and ninth month. The adoption was closed because I already felt like my heart was in pieces and did not want to shatter it loving a baby that could never truly be mine.

I never saw the adoptive parents or the baby.

One of the strangest moments in the adoption process is choosing a family. I don't know any of these people and I didn't feel qualified to choose who deserved a baby more than any other family. It felt so contrived and I felt like less of a person for playing god with these families even if they never knew I made the decision to pass them over.

I spent a lot of time in bed when I was not constantly at work. I didn't really eat well if I ate at all. The adoption agent called me everyday to check on me after she noticed how hard of a time I was having. In order to get through the days, I tried to form a routine down to the minute and even watched the same movie every night because it gave me comfort. 

Now thinking back on it there's some blank spots. Moments in time where it feels like I just disappeared, but I know I lived through that part in my life.

The only memory that sticks out sharp is every line in the movie Forrest Gump, but that comes from seeing it close to 180 times."

I think one reason women tend to have more clothing items is just because the ""options"" are necessary. This style skirt only works with a certain cut top, and these tops look monumentally better with high-rise pants, and these blouses require a camisole underneath, yada, yada, yada.

Dated a couple guys (not very long, with that attitude) who seemed to take my general reluctance to wear makeup every day as an indicator of low self esteem and would make a big deal about trying to assure me that I looked 'fine without makeup' if I ever mentioned someone else's. 

Like, bro. It's just my face. Chill. I have eczema and wearing foundation a lot makes my skin peel off. Their eyeliner was on point, I wanted to give them a compliment.

103,"Both of mine were after weight loss. I went from 188 to 115 and had saggy boobs as a result, and some loose skin on my stomach. I got a tummy tuck about 6 years ago, and breast augmentation a year later. 

Tummy tuck I did because although I had worked so hard to lose weight, it still looked like I hadn't in my stomach. I had always been overweight, so I had never worn a bikini, never had a body to be proud of. I didn't want this to impede the full experience, for lack of a better word. The recovery from it was intense. I was away from work for 2 weeks (couldn't even stand up straight) and had to wear a corset type thing for 8 weeks. It was incredibly painful and a long recovery, but worth every second. I cried when I saw my stomach for the first time after surgery. I couldn't believe it was me. Now I have definition in my stomach, I wear bikinis, etc. The only thing I regret is not getting it done sooner. 

With my augmentation, I felt like I was too young to have boobs that looked like raisins. My only regret is not going a bit bigger, and not getting a lift at the same time. "

Unfortunately, I was not in the best place mentally when we dated and had a lot of insecurity.   This lead to a few fights we probably shouldn't have had.  Combined with his plans to move to the coast, I think he decided I just wasn't worth the trouble.  I still wish I had handled things better, but in  hindsight I realized we weren't very compatible anyway.  I was trying to be someone I'm not for him.  I don't read Ayn Rand and I probably never will.  When we broke up I actually remember thinking, ""Thank God I don't have to finish Atlas Shrugged now!""  He was very social and status conscious while I'm just not.  He was constantly starting new projects that included a lot of time and effort while I would rather spend the weekend reading or playing video games.  


Eventually I met my current SO and I realized how lucky I was that things didn't work out with the other guy.  We're engaged now and so much more compatible!  I feel comfortable in my own skin around him in a way I never was with the ex.  I guess the moral of my story is that sometimes they get away for a reason.   "

111,"Amanda Bynes. Years ago when I was a teen. Before she had a decline. 

She saw me standing. Hoping for an autograph. I was too shy to ask. But she came up to me. Asked if I wanted one. Took pictures with me. And was super kind. 

It's sad she's had some issues lately. She was lovely when I met her."
112,"Do you put shampoo in your hair and then just dry it? No. You rinse it out with clean water. 

Do you soap up your hands after using the toilet and then wipe them on a towel? No. You run water over your hands to rinse the soap and the germs it's accumulated off. 

That's what you do with dishes. If you fail to do that, you leave everything you just washed ""off"" your dishes actually still on your dishes minus perhaps debris. "
113,"Irish person, moved to Paris for a year after graduating. In Ireland, if you're waiting more than a minute or two to get a drink at the bar you make small talk with the people beside you, it doesn't mean you're hittong the person or want to be their best friend, you just want to kill the time until you get your order in.

In Paris they would look at me like I had two heads when I tried to talk to people at the bar.

I live in Dubai now - coming from Ireland... the heat, oh dear god, the heat.

But also, sometimes older local people will skip past me when you're in line - because they're local and male they can do that.

When I'm meeting clients, if they're Middle Eastern it can be hard to know if they're happy to shake my hand or not, some of them are really cool and don't care, some are more conservative, I never which it is.

Also, the French usually do two kisses - one on each cheek, the Arabs do three kisses, I fuck it up every single time."
114,"Not necessarily the one that got away, but my ex (I broke up with him a month ago now) was literally the perfect boyfriend... he loved me so, so much, I knew he would do anything for me. We got along great, were able to communicate with no issues, he was basically my best friend... but, I could never give him what he gave me. I'm selfish and spend a lot of time doing things that better me, not other people (I realize this is a flaw and I'm working on it); I have commitment issues and couldn't see myself marrying him after almost 3 years; he compromised more often for me than I wanted to compromise for him; his sex drive was through the roof and I was constantly turning him down; he was very empathetic, while I am apathetic, and for that reason I knew that I often unintentionally hurt him. 


He wanted kids where I didn't - and he would sacrifice himself to meet my needs (like, telling me he didn't have to have kids if I didn't want to). And although I loved him so much, in my own way, I just didn't see it as a fair relationship, where he had given me everything and I'd given him 60%.


I often want to go back, for my benefit, but I know that is the selfish part of me thinking that. In the end he will be happier finding a partner who is better suited for him. I learned a lot and I don't regret anything. There will always be a small place in my heart for him. "
115,Thank you! Believe it or not I don't even think about it and I never told anyone. Its like the feelings around the situation are locked away in a vault. That probably isn't healthy but its an honest answer. My mom has always been a mean woman and still is. I left her house (or was forced out) as soon as I graduated from HS. I still talk to her but its like talking to a stranger. I share nothing personal with her. 
116,"not my story but my mom's (about me, so i guess it's kinda my story).

she was in her early 30s and knew she wanted to have a kid but didn't expect to meet anyone anytime soon or potentially ever. she's a very smart woman, astrophysics phd, from germany and a bit socially awkward, for context. a friend of hers was having marital trouble and moved in for a little while, and she decided basically, hey i like this guy, and he has good genes. so he ""donated"" his sperm ~if you know what i mean~. he got back together with his wife after a while, and my mom did end up meeting a man she loved about a year after i was born. but i know she's never regretted it, and i know she wouldn't have even if she hadn't gotten married. as for how she handled it... i did have a nanny who would babysit me when she was at work, which sometimes was overnight given my mom's line of work. my mom is also very practical and frugal (and has always made more than my dad), so on a single income i think we would have survived fine. she's told me even today, they live off of one of her two paychecks and the rest essentially goes into savings."
117,"Women's clothing tends to be designed to show more skin.  I prefer being covered.

I have no experience with other forms of abuse.*

I once saved a woman at a party from her abusive boyfriend. She was giving me ""the look"" that said help. I don't even know how we made eye contact. I just casually approached her and pretended to be looking for my friends so I could hear what the guy was saying to her. I eventually noticed he yanked her hair.  Long story short, I got the police involved, he was forced to leave and ended up getting in a fist fight with valet attendants and arrested. Ever since this, I'm always super cautious because things can go down hill very fast and people that need help may not be in a position to put right ask. "
119,"I grew up in a place under abstinence-only education.  So all I knew about were condoms and birth control pills.

So rather than have the awkward conversation with my mom at 14 of why I wanted birth control pills, my boyfriend and I just used condoms.  At 15, it had worked for us for so long, I imagine we got careless and it probably tore without us realizing.  But I don't know.  I didn't find out til a few weeks later.

I already knew I was lucky and have been grateful, but after the thread yesterday I felt like calling my mom and crying and thanking her again for not only letting me get an abortion but paying for it, too.  But I imagine she'd rather not talk about it.  She was raised Catholic and did right by me, and that's all I can ask of her, I don't need to remind her."
120,"Yes it's real. Not only soapy water but the water after filling the sink with the dirty dishes in it. Sometimes he would rinse it off, sometimes he would dry with a towel..

After that he cut all contact with me. He didn't even formally break up with me. He just stopped talking to me, and then through a third party I found out he moved to Hawaii. I also found out he was dating another girl at the same time. She harassed me for the rest of high school. I moved away, I don't know where either of them are. But ya, that's my worst fuckboy story.

Americans are notoriously bad about paying attention to their server. I've been waiting tables for years and more often than not, Americans won't order their next drink (despite knowing they want another one and their current one almost being gone) until their drink is completely gone. Then they get irritated that you weren't right there when they needed. This also pertains to sauces, napkins, whatever else they might need to eat. If you aren't right there when they need something, you can guarantee your tip is going down. I'll even ask a table if they need anything else but half of them won't be paying attention or talking over me. This makes me have to check in just in case they needed something. Also, in most places sodas are refillable for free. So I need to check in to see if they want anything else. You learn to be pretty good about these certain things and feeling out each table but trust me. It's annoying for us servers too. I wish I could just sit back and wait until they were done. Lol"

135,"I got cosmetic surgery when I was 11. Yup you read that right 11. Not because I was in some horrific accident but because I was bullied. My family genetically has ears that stick out from the side of the head farther than average ( kinda like a satellite dis) . When I started elementary school I wore my hair in ponytails all the time and kids started pointing it out and called me dumbo. I cried about it all the time because I was so young and it really crushed me. My mom had gotten the same surgery as I did when she was 25 so she was the one who found me a doctor to do it.  The procedure is basically a couple stitches that just connect the back of your ear to the side of your head a little more. 
I don't think I will ever regret that surgery (unless I have kids and have to explain why their ears are like that and mine aren't) I felt so much more confident after I looked more like a normal kid nobody said anything and people just forgot about it.

139,"
I am also a child of a sperm donor, and was conceived in the 1970's - a time when there were no sperm banks, medical record documentation, or a donor sibling registry. As I grew up, I knew that there would be no way for me to ever know who my donor was - there just wasn't a process for that in place back then. And growing up, I felt an empty place in my heart whenever I thought about who he was, but I finally resigned myself to embrace the fact that my donor's intent was to make a contribution to help further the field of fertility, and in doing so, he also gave me the ultimate gift - my life. 

A couple of years ago, I ordered genetic testing through 23andMe to find as much about my relevant medical history from the paternal side as possible. I had just been diagnosed with an immunodeficiency that can have a genetic link, and any information at all that I could find would be helpful. 

I had no plan of actually finding current demographic information of my actual donor - I just didn't think something like that could be possible. So y'all can imagine my surprise when the genetic report listed DNA family members, and the first person on the list was a first cousin, whose name I wasn't familiar with. I later found out that he is, in fact, my sperm donor's nephew. Unbelievably, I found the identity of my sperm donor. 

It was so difficult to build up the courage to reach out to my first cousin from 23andMe, and I've never felt more vulnerable as I was waiting for his reply. I didn't know how his family would react. Would they want to know I exist? There was no way for me to let them know that I had no agenda other than trying to find information that could help me in my fight for my health. Turns out that they are a family of wonderful, kind, amazing people, and they've welcomed me with open arms.  Not only did my donor give me the gift of life, but he's also given me a new wonderful, supportive family. 

Sadly, my donor has passed away, but I'm forever grateful for his generosity forty years ago. Yet, I still had so many questions. Did I look like him? Was he a bookworm like me? Would he be proud of me? Throughout my life, when asked the question regarding what person in history, alive or dead, that I would choose to have dinner with, my answer I was him. Every time.  And while I wasn't able to meet him in person, I like to think if it is possible, perhaps he's looking out for me and maybe orchestrated our connection.

I find it very difficult to relate, because I know no one like this (hence why I browse Askwomen, I guess). Every guy I know in real life is a happy, well-adjusted feminism-supporting adult with a number of successful friendships and relationships with women.

He studied philosophy (doing his doctors) and I love love LOVE having deep conversations with him. 
He insults people quite a lot ""as a joke"". And that can hurt sometimes. But then you just say ""I'm not in the mood, these comments hurt today"" and then he gets all sweet and caring within a second. 
He's wonderful, but so many people dislike him because they don't get him. 
He is wonderful. So supportive. And just so smart. But he comes across as weird for sure. 


Another friend of mine: she hasn't got that many friends. She is gorgeous, breathtakingly beautiful. But she is arrogant. Extremely arrogant. This has never bothered me, because she isn't rude or mean, is no bully. Just extremely sure of herself. But I love her so much. I always have the best time with her. We have so much fun. I hate when people talk bad about her, because it's so not deserved. (And yes, I've always stood up for her) Yes, she's confident, maybe sometimes too confident, but she is such a great person.

Aside from having walked in the store at the same time, there was no hint that we were together or even knew each other at all. When I picked up my games and paid for them, my husband was standing off to the side. The cashier handed him the games and my change, and I was too stunned to say anything.

I decided I wanted to propose about four months before I actually did. I fished around for ideas on what to propose with but came up with nothing - he's not a jewelry person so a ring was out. I subtly asked him his opinion on watches and he said he wouldn't wear one, yada yada. So I decided to give something small and symbolic to propose with and to give him a more official gift later.

The first thing I ever bought him when we started dating was a bag of gummy bears. He loves the things. It's almost an obsession. Sooo I decided to put a gummy bear in a ring box and have at it. I know he'd get the symbolism so it seemed like a good idea at the time...

I get the bears and borrow a ring box. Morning of, I was determined. My plan was to ask him over breakfast... but he had a stomach ache, so the mood wasn't right. Then, I changed my plan to taking him out later for dinner that evening, surprising him with a couple of his friends from out of town being there as well and pop the question there. But the restaurant was really, really noisy and didn't exactly make the right mood either. So the friend surprise worked but I didn't ask him there. We went home, got under blankets and played videogames and cuddled.  Perfect mood! I started prepping myself, but then he announced he was tired and going to bed.

SO NOW laying in bed in the dark staring at the ceiling. I was still determined to ask that day because I knew I'd lose my nerve otherwise. I had tied the bear into the box with a ribbon at this point and it was sitting at the foot of my nightstand. My nerves were shot and I was stressed.

I thought 'fuck it'. I turned the lamp on, sat up, grabbed the box and turned towards him. He looked really confused when I opened the box and asked him to marry me. He was silent, looking back and forth between me and the box. At this point I felt something was wrong and looked down at the box myself. It was empty. 

The bear had fallen out. I had asked him to marry me with an empty box. 

At this point, my nerves snapped. I started bawling. Like, baaaawwling. He understandably gets the deer in the headlights look, just staring at me as I'm fishing around in the damn blankets for the damn bear. I finally find the little proposal-ruiner and hold it out to him, still bawling. He's silent. 

And then his eyes bug out. He realizes I'm being serious. Yes ladies and gents, he thought I was pulling his leg.

He starts stammering. I'm still crying, harder now because 'THIS WAS AN AWFUL IDEA YOU'RE TERRIBLE AT PLANNING THINGS' is now repeating over and over in my head. He finally nods, still too struck to say anything. 

Cue me crying even harder, because now I'm happy. He hugs me and my addled brain starts going nuts. So between sobs I start yelling 'I thought it'd be cute!' over and over. I can't seem to just calm myself down. He just holds me while I cry my embarrassment out. 

When I finally stop crying, I ask 'Are you sure?' He smiles and kisses me and says yes. 

So now we're three months out from the marriage, he's still somehow totally willing to marry me, and I hate gummy bears and their betraying ways."

The father left when my son was about 8 weeks old but you know what guys? I graduated college this past Saturday, my son is 2, and our life is fine. We don't have much but we have just enough. I love him and it's not even this big ""sacrifice"" like it used to be - I just do what I have to do. I have my regrets, but we're surviving. "

171,"I went to a drag dinner theater for my bachelorette party and they called everyone getting married or getting divorced on-stage to celebrate.  It struck me as really supportive and wholesome, and giving someone who might be going through a rough time something fun to celebrate.  

One of the ladies getting divorced said her husband had cheated on her with another man.  She ended up befriending the other man and he was actually at the drag show with her to celebrate the divorce.  More power to them, making something fun and nourishing out of an all-around bad situation, which is kind of what divorce parties are all about.  "

I was sadly at work, but she was at the house to drop stuff off and was harassing my SO. We use the extra breastmilk I pump for things like oatmeal or smoothies for the little people (excellent money saving alternative, if nothing else). My SO had made him a breakfast smoothie and had added spinach in it, so it was green.

StepMIL was making a wild point about ""what is this rubbish you are feeding him"" and took a mouth of it. Our five year old told her politely that it had Mummy milk in it.

Beautiful, milky karma."
180,"Oh man, SO MUCH this. I am straight, so I only have seen one side of this, but every single guy who wanted me to shave every inch of my body before they'd consider going down on me usually wore t-shirts with writing on it and old jeans when we went out. "

My boyfriend doesn't like body hair on me, but he doesn't like it on himself either. The woman I dated didn't care at all for either of us, which I liked because it mirrors how I feel. Neither gave a shit about makeup or hair stuff.

I do think it's probably more common for men to expect things from women that they don't do for themselves than it is for a woman to expect it from another woman if she *herself* doesn't do it. "
184,"Your point about cards against humanity is a good one. Know your audience.

You worry that they don't like you as much as you like them. You want them to think you're funny and interesting. I swallow a lot of anxiety and try to go for it while seeming casual."
188,"Not me, but my dad. He lives right by Rob Thomas and had an encounter with him at a deli counter without realizing who he was, like my dad had no idea he was with a celebrity because he said he was just so chill and laid back like a normal guy. Rob complimented my dads tattoos (he's covered with full sleeves and everything) by saying, ""Hey man, great ink"" and my dad just enthusiastically replied, ""Thanks!"" Rob smiled and left and then the deli guy was like, ""Don't you know who that was??"" And when my dad said no, he explained it was the lead singer of Matchbox 20! My dad saw him again a few times after that because the village in Westchester County my dad lives in is fairly small; after coming back from touring one night, Rob was out with his band and ~posse~ in the local diner and invited my dad over to have a drink with them because he remembered him from the supermarket. So they got to talking how I'd seen them in concert and Rob said it was a shame he hadn't known I was a fan, because he would've hooked my dad up with tickets. Flash forward a few months later, and my dad encountered Rob again! This time he handed my dad a cd that just said ""Hello Danielle (my name)! From, Rob"" with a smiley face in the O in hello that he'd been carrying around on the chance he'd run into my dad again. I was soooo thrilled, not just for the CD but for the fact that Rob Thomas is genuinely a good dude! "

Get really buff? Take art classes? Learn to fish? Join a female rugby league? Start a business and make a million before the year is over? See all 50 states? Volunteer and become a chair of a non-profit or cause that really matters to you? 

**I think the problem with single vs relationship is that both are defining themselves in a relationship centric way. Learn to define yourself apart from your relationship status by embracing and feeding ALL aspects of you.**

 i HATE that people try to pit the lifestyles against each other, as if its a competition. Everyone's life should be awesome, regardless of their relationship status!"

 I currently am in a ltr with an amazing woman who I love dearly and even if girl 1 came back around I'd never leave my current gf. But I do occasionally wonder what things would've been like had I not been an asshole back then.

213,[deleted]
214,"&gt; In hetero relationships, women are often in charge of keeping in touch with family on both sides (my husband's mother always coordinates plans with me!)

my husband isn't very close to his family, just generally speaking. his extended family, whom i've met a few times, are relatively close to each other, and my husband doesn't dislike them or anything...he's just kind of a loner. he's fine with that, and so am i. 

i'm pretty close to my family, so on holidays and stuff we visit my family. it's nice; no fights. 

anyway, last year one of his cousins got married. i guess his dad told him about it 6 or 7 months before the wedding, but i had no idea. so like a week before the wedding, my SIL sends me an email asking about computer stuff (i know a lot about computer stuff) and we chat for a bit about which laptop she should buy and then she's like oh are you guys coming to the wedding on saturday? and i'm like. what wedding? and then my husband comes in and he's like oh yeah there's a wedding, i guess we could go. 

we ended up going, and while we were there i was chatting with his cousins' wives, who are all pretty close because they live near each other (and they are all about 15 - 20 years older than i am -- my husband is the youngest of the cousins), and there was a lot of joking about how maybe people should tell me about events instead of my husband. anyway, i then explained that i wasn't responsible -- or interested in being responsible -- for *his* relationship with *his* family, and that he knew that. this wasn't as harsh as it might sound -- i mean, it's not like my husband was close to his family before we met, and frankly, i'm pretty sure that they've seen him way more frequently since he's been married to me (we see them about once every 2 or 3 years). and the women, who are all pretty progressive so i wasn't worried, were all like ""you know what, good for you. you shouldn't take on that responsibility."" "
215,"Most of the men I know in real life treat and view me as a person. A lot of the men on reddit seem to view women as these weird creatures who are mysterious and strange and do inexplicable things that only make sense to other women. I see a lot of questions on here asked by men about behaviours of women and I'm like ""maybe if you thought of them as a human being the answer would come to you because it's common sense."" "
216,"I've got a lot of experiences I know I will remember for the rest of my life, but only 2 that I recognized as such while they were happening:

- Shortly after leaving my abusive marriage, a male friend of mine jokingly mimicked snapping me with a towel and I flinched, then triumphantly said, ""Hah! You missed!"" He looked surprised and said, ""Did you actually think I was going to hit you?"" And I had this dawn of realization that yes, I had truly believed that this man who would NEVER touch me was going to hurt me, because I had spent years being conditioned to believe that when someone reared back their hand, a hit was coming; and I didn't realize how messed up that was until I was right there in the moment. It felt like such a huge light bulb moment that I knew I would remember it forever.

- In my most recent relationship (Not the abusive marriage), there was an evening where my boyfriend and I and his two young kids were listening to music. ""500 Miles"" by The Proclaimers (one of my absolute favorite songs) came on and his daughter's face lit up because she knew it was my jam. The mood was just right that we all got up and started dancing around the living room together; and I just remember feeling like life was going in slow motion: Looking around at the laughing faces of these three people I loved dearly, feeling the freedom and silliness of dancing around like fools and knowing how happy this moment was for all of us together -- it was such a moment of pure joy that I knew I would never forget it."
217,"Yes, but I didn't really notice him at first! I was in Italy years ago, and was just taking a general picture of the street we were on. When I had the film developed (2004, represent), I saw him. This random guy was walking toward our group and must have noticed me lifting my camera just in time, so he smiled the biggest smile in the world, with his tongue kind of *just* caught between his teeth (kinda sexy ngl), and flipped his tie over his shoulder like a movie star. He had sunglasses on and everything. It's one of my favorite pictures, and I had no idea it was even happening :)

226,"I had the copper IUD for 9 years and it was the best decision of my life!

The pain of installation was terrible, but only for like 45 seconds. For 3-4 hours after I had mild cramping. From then on I had normal periods.

I still used my DivaCup from some reason there is a myth that this pulls out the iud? I asked my OBGyn and she just laughed. So I had no issues there.


The best part is after 9 years, when I wanted to get pregnant I had it removed and was immediately fertile because there were no hormones in my body (like with the pill/shot it can take 3 months to a year to become fertile again--although some women don't experience this at all.)


I got pregnant the first time I ovulated after removal (like 16 days later?). Currently a little over 12 weeks. As soon as this kid comes out I am going to get another one until we want another baby.



I don't know if you can tell but I totally recommend it for everyone with normal periods who don't require hormones."

243,"The majority of reddit is kind of a weird mix of conservative and liberal, which a lot of people have come to refer to as ""brogressive."" They have very conservative views about poverty/welfare, civil rights movements, and women's sexuality. Yet they have progressive views when it comes to pot legalization, net neutrality, and some other pet causes. They'll support gay rights but not trans* rights, and even their support of gay rights is pretty limited (they'll complain about gay people being too ""in your face"" about their sexuality, they'll only support civil unions but not marriage, and they're pretty split on gay couples being allowed to adopt). 

It's a type of progressivism that is very self-serving for white straight males. But it's far enough left that they can kind of pat themselves on the back for it. "
244,"Ugh god. I feel like all I deal with are fuckboys (which, upon reflection, is probably something more to do with me than them at this point). Let me give you a timeline of the last decade of my life. 

9th grade: Boy publicly pestered me to hook up with him while he had a girlfriend, and promised to leave her form me if we hooked up (how romantic).

10th grade: Boy I went to church with would flirt with me every Sunday, asking me on dates and then taking them back when I would try and follow up. 

11th grade: Boy sexually harassed me for three months during a summer program, telling me it was my responsibility to help him ""pop a nut."" Direct quote right there. 

12th grade: Fuckboy sabbatical.

College freshman: And we're back. Guy aggressively pursued me, got mad when I said no, and then proceeded to alienate me from the ""friend"" group.

College freshman summer: Guy I sorta dated the previous summer ended whatever we started up again because he wanted my sister.

College sophomore: One of my ""friends"" tried to cheat on his girlfriend with me. I thought I gave him no encouragement, but I guess he didn't read it as such. He succeed on cheating on his girlfriend, just not with me. 

College junior and senior: Guy proceeded to use me for all of the emotional needs of a girlfriend, but then have actual girlfriends while continuing to sustain an inappropriate emotional connection with me. I definitely was in the wrong with this one. 

Post-grad year 1: Apparently I stopped giving off the homewrecker vibe, but was given the cold shoulder from one of my friends after refusing to give him head in the bathroom of a bar. Sorry, didn't realize a drunken make out session should automatically lead to fellatio. My bad. 

Post-grad year 2: Was romantically pursued by a racist for 6 months. That was fun. 

Post-grad year 3: Not too bad. Just one guy who would be kinda rude on our dates, but the would be blowing up my phone in between. More confusing than fuckboy.  "

248,"What's interesting about this one is that even the most progressive, self-aware men can be guilty of it. It's so ingrained!

I just listened to the latest episode of the Cracked podcast, and they had 3 men and one woman on. Now, Cracked is a notoriously ""SJW"" publication these days, and that's very much reflected in the podcasts as well. At one point in the discussion they were discussing microaggressions and the woman started talking about how strangers asking women to smile is an example. But she can't get the full thought out because the men keep talking over her. 

Later, it's one of the *men* who basically says ""wait, so is a microaggression kind of like how a woman can't get a thought out before all the men in the room interrupt and talk over her?"" They all kind of awkwardly laughed it off and finally let her finish her point. It was really kind of bizarre. It was nice that they realized what they were doing, but unfortunate that it happened at all."

I'm not even that tall (5'8""/173 cm) and the peephole in the door is a hole head length below my eye level. The kitchen counters are so low that when I'm cooking, my neck is in pain because I have to hunch over to work at one. When I stand at a sink in some older buildings, my head is above the mirror, so i can't see my face without taking a few steps back. The sink in my bathroom is below my pelvis when i stand. Most apartments here are older and were built after the Korean war when Koreans were much shorter. But now the population is growing taller thanks to better nutrition, but everything was built for shorter people. "
264,It's sadly pretty common. I wish I could remember the name of the documentary I saw this on but I guess rapists are often granted custody in some form in these cases. So sad.
265,"I ""dated"" a man 10 years my senior for close to a year. What I felt for him was nothing short of real love - he challenged me, made me laugh, and the sex was phenomenal. We spent a lot of time at his place after he lost his primary employment, but it didn't matter to me. 
Last summer I visited as usual and found him half drunk and sullen. His ex (""the one that got away"") contacted him and he was frighteningly nostalgic and happy for the extensive conversation they shared. He read most of it to me --- naturally I was hurt and wildly jealous. 
I told him I was thankful he felt open enough with me to share all of that, because I knew how I felt about him (hint hintttttt).
Him: ....You've been a really good friend to me for the last year. But clearly there is more passion on your end than on mine. 
Literal heartbreak. "
266,"(For context, UK here). When I was about 17, I was on the bus to college, and there was this drop-dead gorgeous guy who rode it every day at the same time. We got off at different stops so I was mustering up the courage to approach him and ask him out.

The day I was going to do, I prettied myself up and bolstered my bravery. He got on the bus and my jaw hit the floor. He was in school uniform. He was a kid. This guy could have passed for 20. I was crushing on a schoolboy.

I wonder how his life is getting on."
267,This thread was up about a week ago. As I said then a man admiring a piece of furniture in my home proceeded to tell me how it was constructed after I told him I built it.
268,"American in Japan. I've been here for two years, but I can't get used to being treated as a leper. People will literally cross the road so they aren't on the same side as you, afraid to talk to you even in Japanese, won't sit next to you on the train unless it is the last seat available, and there was even one time a man jumped back from me and gasped when I made eye contact. 

Sounds like I live in a small country town, but I live in Tokyo, where foreigners are pretty much everywhere. It goes beyond trying to be courteous and makes me feel like I'm the plague."
269,"I don't believe in ""the one"". In fact, I think that concept kills a good many relationships that would otherwise work.

I married my husband because we are well suited and enjoy each other's company. We are opposites in ways that work well and we have personalities that are beneficial to each other. He has traits I lack and vice-versa. We have similar values and goals. 

I've been married 14 years. I will tell you that the biggest part of making a relationship work long time is mindset. If you constantly believe that any bump in the road, difference in personality, or opinion means you missed your ""perfect one"" you're going to be looking for them for the rest of your life. No one is perfect. No one is ever going to be. People change. If you aren't able to look at your SO as an imperfect person (just as you are) and accept them, and learn to work around the imperfections - you're always going to be wondering why things don't last. "
270,"I had a miscarriage removed using one of the same surgical options for slightly further along abortions. Actually, my procedure was also an abortion, because that's the definition of ""ending a pregnancy"". My fetus had already stoped being alive but it's so the same in the medical community.

My insurance didn't cover it so I had to pay out of pocket. The surgery and anesthesia were billed at nearly $7,000. I negotiated it down to $2k, which let me tell you was exactly what I wanted to be doing in the days afterwards."
271,"For me, it's when dads are overprotective of their daughters when it comes to dating and relationships. Especially when it comes to the point that girls aren't allowed to date. People think it's cute but it's actually very unhealthy and I find it disturbing."
272,"Let's see:

- medications are tested on male bodies, and not female ones, because it's believed that menstruation could screw up the test results, as though it would never be a factor after the medications get approved. 

- Vehicles are designed for male bodies as well, so women are more likely to be hurt by airbags etc in an accident.

- Women are considered a ""special interest group"" politically, despite making up around 51% of the population.

 How many more examples have you got time for"

276,"A few years after Amy Winehouse had too much to drink I heard a 12-y-o boy sing a slowed-down version of Rehab in tribute and I cried

277,"I don't have any love interests that got away but I do feel like I have a lot of friendships ""that got away"" like we never ended on bad terms and they are really cool but we have drifted too far apart for it to be not weird if I randomly hit them up to hang out."

280,"Same. Different field of work, but same thing. Sometimes it frustrates him because he really really wants me to understand so he spends a long time trying to clarify, but I just... no. That makes it worse."
281,"LOL, my husband is a craft beer enthusiast and I can't drink beer due to the gluten. I've tried, even going so far as to get a flight at a gluten-free brewery with him and trying them, but everything just tastes so bitter and I hate it. He's always asking me to smell his beer and it all just smells like coffee to me. It's maddening to listen to him sometimes but he loves it so I oblige."
282,"To me, yes. 

I know people are gonna be all ""*they shouldn't be uncomfortable/hurt if they fit right, r/abrathatfits will save you omg!!!1!*"", but mine fit and they're still not 100% comfortable. "

It's heartbreaking to think someone that did so much for my mental health through his work, struggled so much with their own."
284,"When I lived in the UK, I never did get used to their phone numbers.  They come in wildly differing lengths, as opposed to the standard 7 digit (or 7+3 for long distance) that I'm used to in the States.  I just had to have people write things down for me."
285,"Shoes. Almost all shoes for men seem to be practical, normally coloured (black, dark blue, or brown), and flat. When I go shopping for shoes, I usually come home empty handed because half the shoes in the store have heels with whom you could stab people, and the other half are either too expensive, extremely ugly (pink glitter stuff, bright neon colours...), or simply don't fit well. I can't wear men's shoes because my feet are too small. I guess I'll just keep gluing the soles of my old shoes back on..."
286,breaking the rules of your relationship
287,"My big issue with that is that if I layer a cami or undershirt under a drapey tee, it ruins the drape and makes me look as big in the waist as I am in the bust. Super unflattering. Also, for deep v's, the undershirt will show, ruining the look. So my options are to lean into the sheer shirt with a black bralette (which also ruins the drape since it turns two singular boobs into one boob area) or suck it up with a nude bra that's still visible or just not own cute drapey but semi transparent white tees. I go with option three BUT I'M REALLY BITTER ABOUT IT OKAY."
288,"A nurse where I work got pregnant while taking her pills as instructed.  Except pfizer messed up the order and put the sugar pills in the wrong part.  Looks like over 100 pregnancies resulted.

289,"This is so true!

Even when women and men like a thing, men are perceived as liking it in the *correct* way, for the *correct* reasons, whereas women clearly do not. (See Doctor Who for a good example of this)

Also, it's totally fine if a dude can rattle off Rainman-level sports stats but if a girl has that much interest in *anything not dude-approved* she's got something seriously wrong with her."
290,They wouldn't be an so after that!
291,"Had a shit day at work. Went to pub. Met some dude at the bar around 2am and we were both already fairly drunk. Had mad chats and many pints - both gave each other some perspective on on the shit days we'd just had, and just random shittalking. Saw each other off in cabs with a drunken ""rad to meet you, have a great night! See you around!"" Turned out we were both hospo and knocked off around the same time, also he was a musician who played that bar semi regularly so we bumped into each other pretty regularly over the next few weeks; loads of drunk nights having long chats about the girl he was crushing on and the struggles i was having and many pints.

I ended up dating this chef i worked with, he asked me to come see his friends' band with him one night, and lo and behold there's my beer buddy up on stage! He ended up being a regular guest at our house and we forged one of those ""don't need your number because i know I'll see you around"" kind of friendships.

We've dropped in and out of contact over the years, he's dated a couple of my friends, I've dated a couple of his, we've unexpectedly stumbled across each other in different cities, and we most recently caught up at a wedding where neither of our SO's could make it, so we ended up going alone together and it was like no time passed at all :)

Over ten years later, I'll always have a place in my heart and life and immense time for him. One of the best blokes you could ever hope to call a friend. Happy-sad to see him move to Europe later this year to be with his partner, but I've already asked him to be a bridesmate for my own wedding in a couple of years time."
292,Like I'd be single.
293,"Not the person you're replying to, but I think it's both that and them not knowing who you are. Anonymity goes both ways, and it's much easier to dehumanize a little blue line of text than a person you're staring at."
294,"5'5, broad shoulders, abs with no effort, biceps from about 8 years old, and calves that'd make a bodybuilder envious. I've always been very muscular, definitely taking after my dad. 

The main thing that helped was accepting there are certain things that I will never suit, such as all the dainty, pastel coloured lace stuff, or the current trend with all the shoulders cut out (to quote my boyfriend, ""You look like the Hulk bursting out of something""). But it's important to know what I do look good in. 

Halter neck? No mice over my shoulders with these amazing traps.

Backless? My back looks carved out of stone, yo.

Crop tops? I was BORN ready for crop tops.


Interestingly another thing that really helped was subscribing to a load of subreddits of women of my body type (r/athleticgirls, r/hardbodies etc.) and seeing the positive comments for women who were often more built than me (but also waaaaayyyyy hotter). It reinforced the idea that my body type IS an attractive one! I don't use that method any more but it did do me wonders amongst all that negative thinking "
295,"R/tinder loves to blame women for being boring instead of just owning up to not being good at making conversation. It's no biggie if someone struggles to make conversation (I do too, at times) but being bitter as hell about it is super ugly "
296,"My bird repeatedly says ""Who's a momma's boy? Archer's a momma's boy.. yes he is"". So I would guess that is one of the most common.  

Then I ask my cat why he has to be such a bugger.  He's not really but he is insistent on keeping me in bed when I""m not feeling well (will follow me around meowing if I get up and he thinks I should be laying down lol). 

For the rats, it's a ""Which of my ratatats wants a salad. Oh my goodness all of your do well this is my salad you can't have it. Aww look at those pouty faces, of course, you can have some salad. Come and get it"" lol"
297,"There is no general opinion. This will always be a very personal thing. Myself, I'm not into it at all. "
298,"I placed a child for adoption July 2016. I was 26.

Sometimes I feel very isolated in my experience. I found out I was pregnant at 7 months - too late to get an abortion, though I went to a clinic and tried. I never saw an ultrasound, required a c-section and never saw the baby, and never wanted to. It went straight to the NICU away from me and I went from the L&amp;D ward to the ""normal"" surgery recovery wing. I have no idea where the baby went the second it left my body and frankly do not care. I only found out its name and gender because I was erroneously sent a hospital bill for a circumcision. 

I am financially able to raise a child, and have a stable and loving partner who would assist me in that. But I did not want to and never wanted to. 

I did not want to carry that thing and did not want to give birth to it. I did not and do not want it to be a part of my life and have never waivered in my decision.

The struggles I face are the fear of my own body, and the ""what ifs"" if it happens again. I take pregnancy tests almost every week now, because it is the only thing that can help calm my anxiety. Seeing pregnant women, or babies, in person or on TV sometimes lead to extreme anxiety because I remember what a horrible experience it was for me, or how trapped I felt. I felt like a vessel for a thing and as if my life did not matter. I was a month out from graduating law school and took the bar exam 2.5 weeks after giving birth. It was hell. 

My agency has attempted to put me in contact with other birthmoms to help me. It has honestly caused me more anxiety than relief due to my views on the baby. I would have gotten an abortion if I could, and I never had a single question about where it went or what its condition was after birth. My only concern was signing the relinquishments and taking my life back. "
299,"Animal abuse in Latin America. The callousness to animals brings tears to my eyes. 

I rescued a dog with a ""collar"" made of barbed wire linked to a chain so he wouldn't be tempted to run away. The barbed wire had grown into his skin. Cried a river but eventually, he was rehabilitated and his owners fined (should have been jailed as far as I'm concerned)."
300,"Also in China, I could not handle the spitting. And I don't mean just on the street. But people spit on the floor in restaurants! I understand the air is gross and phlegm happens...but not on the floor next to the table I'm currently eating at!"
301,Do not lose yourself. Keep your hobbies. Share your personal time with other people you love like friends and family. Some space is super healthy. 
302,Philip Seymour Hoffman. I loved him.
303,"The dudes I dated were all very controlling and there was a massive double-standard re: aesthetic expectations-- I was always expected to be hairless, extremely thin, straightening my naturally very curly hair, dress very modestly in public but be a ~freak in the bed. One of my exes would look at girls when we were out together and be like, ""now that, that's a *perfect* waist-to-hip ratio,"" among other wretched things. Another ex-boyfriend would consistently tell me how I did my makeup or took care of my skin was wrong, despite him having some of the worst hygiene I've ever seen. 

Meanwhile, girls I've dated have been 100% chill about how I look and take care of myself. I think a lot of it comes from women knowing the bullshit expectations pushed onto other women, so they tend to not be assholes when it comes to you for the most part. I've always felt like I could be more comfortable around other women, even when I've been at rock bottom self-loathing. It simultaneously has made me more comfortable in my own skin but also encouraging to take care of myself more since there's no pressure. My wife loves me in all the ways I feel comfortable being myself, and I love her for all the ways she is comfortable being herself. I wouldn't change a thing about her or expect anything different. "
304,Agree and the back of yo head look ridiculous! Mhmm.
305,"The apparent terror Americans live in all the time that they feel the need to be armed to the teeth against everyone. Their neighbours, the government, strangers, people of other religions and races, foreigners, grizzly bears, you name it: the solution is a firearm. It explains a lot. My grandmother had to carry the milk home from the the barn past howling wolves before she was six years old and she was less afraid at five than these adult men are. It's pathetic. My grandfather was fighting the Red Army at age 17 without real guns, just bayonets (no ammunition) and he was less afraid than the average American I meet. I cannot imagine how fucked up I would be if I were living in terror every second of my life if I were not carrying a loaded weapon. No wonder the rest of the world has the ideas they do."
306,"Make sure you don't vote Conservative, then. We're not going to have it for long at this rate."
307,Something I've noticed about extreme women haters is they get angry when a woman has a mind of their own. My opinion is that if a woman has a mind of her own then the woman can reject the man and can't just blindly follow orders. So to justify not having to get close to a woman and face possible rejection they will clump all women together and claim they're all equally horrible. Instead of facing their own shortcomings they will put all the blame on other people so they never have to realize they have things they need to work on for themselves.
308,"This makes my blood boil. I fucking hate layering clothes. Wanna wear this blouse? Too bad, gotta find the perfect color, shape, and length of camisole. Then you're gonna be hot and feel constricted. 



And don't even get me started on crop tops. I like them but I'm a mother, I can't be walking around in them all the time. WHY is every casual top in stores these days a damn crop top. Why. "
309,"In my case, they did a well-woman exam (breast exam and annual gynecological exam). They also renewed my birth control prescription at the time. "
310,"I think they are referring to if person A was to say a slur or be condescending to person B, then say to person A ""hey what's your problem?""

Though it might seem obvious of Person Bs feelings, you don't make any assumptions on their behalf "

315,"I agree with the points raised so far, but would add: Blameshifting

These guys are deeply unhappy and/or maladjusted, and incapable of looking inward to find out how to change. Thus they blame shift onto women."
316,"Started yelling at scary looking men in the rough part of town, then aggressively challenging them to a Meat Loaf singing contest whilst waving my shoes at them. They ended up looking scared of me. "
317,"Yes, this. I just saw a topic on another forum where a semi-controversial blogger (to some, I think she's great personally) recently came out and said she divorced her husband because he was assaulting her and that she only spoke out about the domestic abuse because she was tired of people saying she didn't care about her marriage. Someone on the site said, ""Well, what did she do to make him so mad? Obviously she must have done something to really incite him"" like?????? That mentality is so gross??? Stop adding onto the stigma those who have experienced abuse already face :-\ "

324,"Maybe it's a case by case basis but with dating a woman I found we were more relaxed about our appearances, maybe it was our environment at the time but I didn't really care about if I was perfectly groomed or I had no make up on and I didn't mind for her either. 

With men I've always felt compelled to look good at all times, I'd say for men I put on more of a performance of what I feel they want me to be while with women I find it easier to just be myself. I guess I'd have to date more women to get a really rounded opinion though. "

332,"Internalized sexism that happens often is saying ""Our Founding Fathers"" because women didn't found our nation too. Or how art was created by men from early dawn and somehow speaks for all of humanity whereas when women created art it speaks for the female perspective only. I was listening to a tedtalk about this because the speaker was at a museum and asked the curator which girl made the cave wall painting and he sneered at her saying ""women didn't paint 5000 years ago, only men were allowed"". Basically all of the art created by hamlet for example ""to be or not to be"" was a story told about humanity from the male perspective including the female perspectives he told of in the story yet it's our story. Female painters often selling less often or for less money than their male counterparts. Female playwrights overlooked, singers oversexualized, books unpublished. A whole history built on male perspective telling everyone's story and no one thinks twice about it. "
333,"You know it's about God damn time someone mentions that. When you (not you specifically) give the ole midsection handshake, you can't grip that shit like you're hanging off the side of a building. You gotta see what pressure works for the man and what speed as well. It's not like you're churning butter. 

Also, speed is a big factor. It's a frickin marathon, not a sprint, so it might not be a bad idea to stretch out before hand--but not the penis, the penis does its own stretching.

 Which brings to my next point. You ever been on a slip and slide with no water? It sucks balls. I feel like I don't need to expand more on that one.

Finally, I wanna talk about the nuts. It's like when the hand wants to hang out with the penis and the penis is all like ""Yeah, that sounds fun, can I bring my two friends?""And when you're hanging out at the bar with the penis and his two homies and the hand just talks with the penis all night and the balls feel awkward and just kind of stares at its phone and mindlessly scrolls through Facebook. Then the nuts get depressed and hangs lower (yes I know that's not how it works) than it normally would... Sometimes one gets more depressed than the other.

The point I'm getting at here is that a hand-joe is a fine art and no matter how ""tough"" any guy comes off as, his Weiner is always going to be a sensitive artist, and you can't be some uncultured savage with it. 

And hopefully someone can appreciate the fact that this took me 15 minutes to write."
334,"Relationships.

When some people say they're alone, they tend to mean ""I don't have as many relationships as I'd like to have, though yes I do have a few online friends, a partner and my loving parents"". I have no one. Like, no one. No family, no friends, no nothing. It's a bit frustrating because solitude really sucks."
335,"This can apply to pretty much any group but listening to what we have to say about our own experiences rather than trying to speak for/talk over us when it comes to issues that affect.

His older brother decided to tell him that steak was cow, and that set it off. We were at the supermarket, and he cried and kissed a salmon at the fish counter and said he was sorry. 

He asked if people *had* to eat animals, and I was honest and said no. So he decided he'd like to not eat animals. "
339,"My mom is kinda set in her ways and doesn't necessarily follow societal norms. She does not approve of me drinking, even though it's completely acceptable for my father and brother to imbibe. 

One evening she and my father popped over for a surprise visit. I'd had a few glasses of wine prior to their arrival and I was doing my best to appear as the most sober daughter ever.
 
My mom was sitting across from me on a couch while wearing a knee length skirt. She kinda adjusted and moved over... and I got a full view of old-lady hairy vagina. Like, I saw everything. And I was drunk and pretending to be not drunk, and I couldn't say anything. I just sat there for the rest of the visit in a horrified stupor. 

This was years ago and sometimes when I close my eyes I can still see Mom Snapper. "
340,"Sizing inconsistency is the big one, but I also hate how fast women's trends change compared to men's and how impossible it becomes to shop outside of whatever that trend is.

Even target changed their basic vnecks recently and now they're fucking huge. "
341,"I had a rhinoplasty.


My nose really bothered me. Especially seeing myself in pictures, I didn't feel like I looked like me. No one really knew I felt this way - I have always been complimented on my facial features and having a unique look and I even modeled a bit years ago. Although I wrestled with the idea of getting a nose job for a very long time, I convinced myself not to do anything because it felt superficial to have an invasive surgery without a medical reason. When the opportunity to get the surgery came unexpectedly, I knew if I didn't take it, I probably would never get it done.


It wasn't a decision I took lightly. I always took pride in being more than my looks - I am educated, have a great job, and am financially independent. I am still all of those things. I am very happy I chose to get my nose done. I wouldn't say it had a significant impact on my life - many people did not even notice, and new people I meet would never know I did anything - but I am more confident. When I see pictures of myself now, I don't focus on my nose and how much I hate it anymore. From my perspective, I have one life, and I don't know how much time I have. If I can safely do something that will make me feel better while I do life in this body, I am all for it."

343,"Choices regarding having kids or not having kids. It's such a personal thing, often with a lot of factors that you don't want to talk about with people outside your inner circle."
344,"For me, it's all about our conversation. Does he ask about me? Is he genuinely getting to know me? Is he giving me enough information to allow me to get to know him? Most guys who are only looking for fun will keep conversations very light, they won't really ask questions about you or what you do, and the sure fire way to know is if he always brings the conversation back to the physical/sexual. Or if he calls you ""sexy"" or asks to hang out but not on a real date because that would be too much effort for him, but a Netflix and chill, or out to a club type thing. You can feel in your gut when he just wants ""fun."" When a guy is seriously into you you won't even question it. "

350,"r/tinder makes me so sad. Some of the jokes are funny and the pranks they pull on some people don't hurt anyone, however, there are times when someone gets on just to be mean to an overweight girl or a woman with kids. Do they not deserve love too? Why must you ruin their day just for some internet points? 

The same guys who swipe on women just for jokes complain when girls swipe on them and don't respond or ghost after a few. ""The women I match with aren't serious, so therefore ~~I must hurt other women to save my self esteem~~ all women aren't serious on Tinder""

352,"&gt;and I have to have the right type of shoes

Reminds me of another thing about women's fashion that I loathe: fucking  accessorizing.  It's not enough that I spend $50 (being very optimistic) on a top and bottom, I *also* need the appropriate shoes, jewelry, a belt that doesn't hold anything up, some stupid scarf that doesn't even keep you warm, a hair accessory, and the kitchen sink.  And you have to have some knowledge of *how* to pair things.  Like, earrings, necklace, ring, and bracelet *might* be too much, but not if it's a certain size, and sometimes certain stones and metals are in fashion, and those shoes don't match that skirt, that necklace is too casual/dressy, blah blah blah.  It's exhausting to even think about.  "
353,"Walked out of a bar at 2am on college campus.  I was almost blackout drunk.  Looked over and saw a cop across the street and yelled at my friend ""be right back, I think that cop wants to fight me.""


Lucky for me he ignored it and my friend took me home. "
354,Fucking livid. That would be an automatic dealbreaker.

357,"I got an abortion there (well, I got the abortion pill) and they also helped me safely leave a physically abusive relationship.

Most PPs just do referrals for abortions, but the one I went to did surgical abortions and also provides the pill like I had. 

They are life saving and I will defend them and support them for the rest of my life, because I'd be in a completely different place without them. I can still remember how the nurses there went out of their way and on their own time to help me. I have no clue if they remember me, but I still remember them."
358,"I know you're probably looking for physical but I have a deep voice. I used to get teased in middle school for having a ""manly"" voice. I'm in the last bits of music school and now everyone is always jealous of my voice. I have sopranos saying they wished they could sing as low as I can and professors trip over themselves to put me as the last alto II because my voice doesn't strain to be low and rich. I used to HATE it because I was so embarrassed about sounding like a man, but music school made me embrace it. My mom and sister both have voices on the lower side too. Just runs in the family."

360,"Years ago I cut my mid-back length hair to a short bob. I loved it. It was really flattering on me and the maintenance was so much easier. My female friends raved about it, and strange women would often compliment my hair.

Almost every dude I knew had a reaction along the lines of ""Why would you cut all your hair off? Your hair was so long and pretty"". A male coworker told me he hoped I'd start growing it back out immegdiately. I started dating a guy like six months later, and he saw a photo of me with long hair and started on a crusade to get me to grow it again. 

It's weird adamantly against short hair some dudes are."
361,I don't even want to think about how many times I've watched The Office...

363,"I used Planned Parenthood for years before I could afford health insurance. I went for an annual exam, std screenings, birth control pills, and condoms. All for about $10."
364,"A few times!

- One guy was being a total creep. He stared at my chest pretty much nonstop and started asking invasive, inappropriate questions within 20 minutes of our date. 
- One was extremely rude to our server and acted as if his behavior should impress me
- This one was a total first for me. He kept trying to take a ""perfect"" selfie of himself. This went on for about 15 minutes before I finally just left. Super bizarre.

365,Oh my good god.

367,"Yes, recently - I got catfished.

I'm a gay woman and I started using Tinder to try and meet other queer girls. I matched with this gorgeous girl who lived near me, had great conversation and seemed to be doing good things with her life.

Fast forward to the date. I'm sitting outside this bar and someone comes up to me and says they're... let's call her Amy. I was shocked. It was the same girl but she weighed about twice as much, her hair was completely different and her makeup looked awful. You would never recognise her from the photos I saw. Being a nice, overly polite gal I didn't say anything and inside we went.

So we got some drinks and started talking. There was no physical attraction there whatsoever but I thought hey, maybe I'll make a friend. Then I found out not only did Amy lie about her appearance, but her whole life. She wasn't a student (told me she was 3rd-year veterinary medicine) and never even finished high school. She still lived with her parents, told me she had her own place. She also wasn't even gay and just bi-curious! That's when I checked out and said I had to go home due to a ""family emergency"". 

Yeah, I deleted Tinder."
368,We're best friends and everything is fun with him.  Even just food shopping is fun.  We just mess around and make each other laugh all the time.  He's great.  I'm so lucky to be his wife ❤
369,"I just spent two months in Japan and after about a month, I was craving a Western style breakfast really, really badly. For the most part, I was staying in minshuku (doing the pilgrimage in Shikoku), so breakfasts *and* dinners were usually rice, fish, miso soup, green tea, and maybe a couple of other dishes that varied between inns. I got really, really tired of it and just wanted a fried egg and toast (which I finally found at a little cafe in Uwajima)."
370,"At an Italian restaurant, a guy a few tables over came up and told me I was amazing at twirling spaghetti. I felt very accomplished by this compliment."
371,"I can't tell whether or not that was intentional to highlight the stereotype, given that Barney had crippling 'daddy issues'. So many things to be irritated about in HIMYM."
372,"My personality and socialization skills. It charms some people, but I don't tend to have life long friendships. I don't know why, but I find them hard to sustain and don't get a lot out of them in the long-term. I'm a great dater, but am way more anxious about platonic rejection. Being rejected as a friend kills me as opposed to be rejected as a romantic prospect. Most people seem to think I'm nice, but I never getting past that acquaintance level. It's kind of been like that since high school. Undergrad was good when I went to a small liberal arts school, but then I transferred to a huge state school. Haven't recovered since.

No matter how old I get, I always feel like I'm the weird girl. It'd be cool to have a best friend who isn't my sister or boyfriend. "

374,I think he thought he was subtly asking you to dominate him. 
375,Seems like everyone here says none but honestly I feel a lot of pressure to wear makeup. Working in a professional setting and having people tell me I look tired or ask if Im okay every time my makeup isn't on is incredibly frustrating. 
376,"My mother adopted 5 kids, we're all biologically related. I was too young to remember all that went on, but she was a foster parent, so most of us had been living with her since we were born. She had children when she was younger, so they were able to help out a lot. I would guess the reason why she kept us was because she got attached after so many years (it was meant to be temporary) and she knew it would have been difficult for us to get adopted. I think it worked out well enough, but it was a difficult situation. "
377,"Michael Jackson..because his music was such a big part of my childhood. I remember watching his funeral on TV and just sobbing the entire time.

Also Robin Williams...I hid in the food closet and just cried and cried for about 20 min. I watched *Hook* and *Jack* (two of my favorite movies of his) that night and tried not to cry through the entire thing.

383,"Exactly! I'm at a point in my life where my daily battle is 'if I wear this white t-shirt, do I not care that it shows my bra because it's just a boob house or do I care because I might get catcalled even more?'

And people wonder why my clothing is 98% black."
384,Kurt Cobain got me good . I had just turned 13 and was just starting to enter my first run in with depression. I had just discovered Nirvana and really connected with the music.
