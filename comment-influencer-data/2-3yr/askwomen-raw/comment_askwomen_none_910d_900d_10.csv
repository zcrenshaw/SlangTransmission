0,"The first date with my current SO, I wore a really sexy black satin dress with a tulip bottom skirt and a pair of orange floral watercolor flats. I felt like one hot piece, but I got to his apartment And had to wait for him to find something or whatever. I sat down and the dress promptly ripped from my ass to the top on my bra straps. 

So my first date was in a pair of his jeans and a baggy tee shirt. AND WE LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER."
1,Raise your hand if this thread is making you regret your life choices / college major!
2,The way to get me to be a happy woman in STEM and stay in the field is NOT to put a white hot spotlight on me all the time because I'm the woman developer
3,"I don't think ""hookup culture""/the proliferation of casual sex has been positive or liberating for women. 

Don't get me wrong, I think it's wonderful that we are free to have sex outside of Holy Matrimony^TM (I certainly have, and no regrets), and if there are women out there who want to have sex with a different guy every night, I see no problem with that. But I think in a lot of liberal urban settings in particular, there's pressure to be sexually open/DTF/""liberated"" in a way that doesn't align with many women's sexual satisfaction let alone emotional needs. 

So many of my girlfriends spent their late teens and 20s hooking up with lots of random guys without ever orgasming, and then getting upset about being ditched after the fact. Yet saying you want a boyfriend or wanting to take it slow somehow makes you prudish or antiquated.

5,"I guess my two ""unpopular"" opinions would be that not everything in life needs to be critically examined from a social justice standpoint. And this is coming from a social worker with a deep interest in the topic. But to quote Freud, ""Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar."" Not *every* movie, song, halftime show, or quote by a celebrity needs to be picked apart and judged as empowering or ""problematic."" 

Second, although I myself don't have children (and may not), being a SAHM is a perfectly valid choice if it's open to you. "
6,"Nurse Practitioner. 

If you are a nurse, I highly urge you to go back for your masters degree.  There is all this chatter about ""there won't be any jobs"" but I'm telling you, nurse practitioners are about to be in high demand and you will forever have a job, just like nurses will.  "
7,"Recruiter.

I'm incredibly introverted and have phone anxiety. So naturally, I got a job where I sit on the phone and talk to strangers all day."
8,"""She slept with me really soon after we met, she's not girlfriend material.""

One. Maybe she had never had any intention of ever even *thinking about* becoming your goddamn girlfriend, asshole. 

Two. You slept with her too. You are equally responsible. "
9,"I watch and manage high voltage power transmission lines for renewable energy sources in West Texas.

I got this job by being in the Navy for a number of years as a power plant operator, then becoming a nuclear plant operator, then going to college and dropping out, then getting really lucky.

EDIT:  Anyone seeking more info about getting a transmission job can ask me questions, but I did a reply to a vet below that I will copy here.

[Take a read through this.  Transmission Operator(or TO) is the certificate I would recommend trying to get as a base level.](http://www.nerc.com/pa/Train/SysOpCert/Pages/default.aspx)  From there, you can move up to a Reliability Operator.

That page also has some detailed resources on it, but it can be a bit intensive.

Another primer you can look into is [Power for Vets](http://www.incsys.com/power4vets/).  They offer a set of courses to help military vets gain access to the power generation and transmission industries.  I think you have to pay them some money, but it is not a huge amount.  It used to be free, though.  And I have heard you can get some assistance with the payment, but reports vary.

Overall, the test for getting certified(regardless of level) is roughly 600 dollars per try.  After that, you have a really good bargaining chip with companies by saying you are motivated enough to have gone out and get your cert on your own.  We have hired two Power for Vets trainees, so I know it can help you on your resume. "

11,"When I was 12/13 and was just figuring out the internet, I started getting messages on Yahoo chat from a man in his mid-late 20's. I thought it was normal and that he was being nice. I would ask him questions like how to tell if a boy liked me and if he thought my parents were being mean (I had a kind of rough childhood). We would talk every day after I got home from school. I never told him anything but my first name and what state I was from, no pictures or anything like that. He said he lived halfway across the country, so I didn't think I had anything to worry about. He started asking if he could pick me up from school and take me to the mall. That kind of weirded me out so I avoided him for a few days. He got mad. When I replied to him again, he sent me a picture of myself in the local paper from when I was in a school play. He knew my full name, what school I went to, and where I lived. I logged off and never logged back on and never told anyone until last year."
12,"Women don't need some existential reason for not wanting kids. It's not that the world is going to shit, or over-population, or so many homeless kids. It's not even that I don't like kids. I just like my life as it is. I like my freedom and my disposable income. My reasons are entirely self-serving, and there's nothing wrong with that. I don't owe the world my spawn. "
13,"I had a reddit PM a while back that was just a picture of me and my kids.  It was from a throwaway account and I think the picture was from my private Facebook account, which does not have anyone but family added to it.

No text, no threats, just someone letting me know they knew who I am. "
14,I really wish cloaks would be a thing. 
15,Sex workers rights are human rights. 
16,"Following women. 

I've been followed numerous times where that's all it was. Following with maybe some catcalling. I just don't understand. If you don't intend to murder or otherwise harm me, what's the point? What's the endgame?"
17,"I think this is unpopular among certain groups of feminists but I take issue with the idea that sexualising yourself is empowerment. I'm really talking about third wave feminists who advocate being 'girly', wearing make up and revealing clothes, posing in objectifying ways, entering beauty pageants etc. as empowering. For an individual, maybe it can be empowering. But I just don't think we live in a society where those kind of images and messages are truly empowering. Unfortunately I think things like the beauty industry, fashion and make up industries, are still predominantly serving the male gaze. And I think we grow up in a culture where I guess I question whether these are ""free"" and empowering choices.

It's like, in a perfect unsexist world where just as much men wear make up and it's a hobby like anything else, then of course the choice to wear make up could be a genuine choice. But in the world we live in? I can't separate it from the overt value people place on women's appearances."
18,"I disagree vehemently with the position that there's no such thing as, for lack of a better term, ""gray rape.""

It's common in feminist circles to argue that rapists always know exactly what they're doing, and in many instances (serial rape being an obvious one) that's true. But in light of how shitty/nonexistent sex ed is throughout much of the US, prescribed gender roles that say women aren't supposed to be too overt about our interest in sex, and that it's only been very recently that we've started having a national conversation about the importance of consent, I think it's absolutely possible for someone to unknowingly violate somebody else's sexual boundaries.

I get wanting to remove plausible deniability from serial offenders by refusing to acknowledge that it can ever happen, but ... I don't buy it."

23,"Haha...I worked for Chuck E Cheese when I was a teenager, and was eating an ice pop because we had just loaded up the freezer, and our boss offered everyone one.  Well, I started eating mine, and he suggested that I go back to the kitchen to eat mine instead of out in the dining area like all the other guys were.  Because I'm a girl eating an ice pop.  WTF?"
24,"They've always been on my level, if that makes sense. They treated me like a person. They seemed interested in my opinions. They didn't write off my emotions or ideas, or try to act like they knew more about what I was feeling than I did. So many guys come at women from this place of superiority. They might not realize they're doing it, but they are. They come at you like you're a conquest, or when you're outside of those situations, they come at you with this subconscious idea in their minds that they know more about something than you do. You'll see them debate one on one with their male friends about something, but when they talk to you, it's like they've taken on a ""teacher"" role and you're their student. I love being able to sit down with my guy friends and know that they're interested in what I have to say, and that they actual enjoy talking with me. It seems like such a little thing but it's so refreshing, especially as someone who works in a STEM field."

27,"I guess I don't understand the criticism of millennials being unwilling to spend large amounts of money to buy things like diamonds/houses/golf club memberships.

I understand why some people are upset by it - because it messes with their bottom line - but I know plenty of people around my parents' age who are just...furious that millennials aren't buying houses, or spending tons of money on items we don't need and can't afford.

Shouldn't that be something that should be praised? Isn't reckless borrowing what caused the housing bubble to burst and isn't that something we should be actively trying to avoid?"

35,This recent trend of if you don't agree on *all* talking points and if you don't agree *enough* on those talking points you're too problematic to be allowed to have a voice in the discussion is counterproductive. Sharing common or in the very least similar goals should be enough in order to work together for those goals. The amount of gatekeeping I see going on is disheartening. Gatekeeping activism in this political climate is nightmarishly shortsighted.

Seriously, never do this. Don't go trying to sabotage other people's relationships just because you have a crush. Whether it works or not, you're a douche. "

41,"Being a SAHM/F and raising kids is not the toughest thing in the world and I hate those who milk it like it is. Not everyone has the finances to do this, single parents and joint parents. Some have to work to afford healthcare for their kid that has complex health needs.  That doesn't compare to being driven mad by Frozen playing 5 times a day because you can't be bothered to say no to your darling prince or princess. 

There are women who are happy being the housewife; doing all the cleaning and the laundry, hot meal on the table for their partner. There is nothing wrong with that if that is what they want, and they made the decision without coercion from others. I'm OCD so cleaning is my role because it's far too much hassle on multiple levels if I don't do it myself."

60,"The ""nagging wife"" stereotype.  Someone asking you once to help out with the dishes is not ""nagging"", they're asking you to do a basic thing that is necessary to keep your living space clean.  Someone asking you several times is - just *maybe* - doing it because *you won't get off your ass and do the goddamn dishes before the ants overrun the house*.  Either way I'm not sure the problem lies with the person doing the asking...  

Also, the ""ball and chain"" stereotype.  What is the deal with acting like marriage is the End of Life?  If you think marriage is so awful, why did you do it?

(This was back in my early twenties when I put myself into a lot of shitty situations.)   This is where I didn't want to have sex after making out, but ended up doing so because I was drunk/didn't know how to say no/was just messed up in general.  

I contrast those experiences with the two that I've had that I think would have been SOLEY the guys fault, because it was very clear that I did NOT want to have sex.

Additionally I almost raped a guy once, because I didn't understand that a guy could be raped.  He was saying ""Stop, don't"" and I almost continued, because I figured he didn't *really* mean it."
69,"Reason #1: he is so emotionally intelligent and empathetic. He's someone I can go to with my issues. He listens. He tries to help. He understands. He's also great at communicating his emotions. I'm so glad I have someone I can talk with instead of fight with.

Reason #2: This guy would walk through rain, sleet, and snow if it meant that I'm safe and taken care of. He cares so much about my wellbeing and supporting my ambitions. My parents always warned me about boys who will try to distract you from your goals. All he's done is try to uplift me.

Reason #3: I feel 100% myself when I am around him. He accepts every inch of me, even the really bad ones. We never run out of things to talk about. I can laugh with him. Cry with him. Get angry with him. He's my best friend.  

Reason #4: He's such a caring individual. It's a trait that is not that strong in me and, although I think his caring nature causes harm to him sometimes, I am jealous of how kind of a person he is. I'm just lucky I have him.

Reason #5: We're moving forward in life together. We've been together 3 years. Since the summer before my freshman year of college. Even though we're infants, I can see our future together. It's so exciting seeing what we are accomplishing together and where we'll go."

So my dad s obsessed it's the show Big Bang Theory. Well a CD/movie store by my house was closing down and had a Sheldon cut out for sale for like $5. So we decided to buy it.

 I managed to distract my father while he was in the garage so my mom could get the cut out inside the house. She put it in the shower in the bathroom halfway peeking out. It looked pretty scary. So finally my mom came downstairs and said to my dad and I, ""Nikki (our dog who was upstairs) is getting sick! She's throwing up in the bathroom!""

So my dad jumped off the couch with my mom and me following behind him, he flicked on the lights in the bathroom, and let out the girliest scream I've ever heard a man in his 50's utter.

77,"X-er here, and we get this shit too, but I hate how millennials are criticized because ""whenever something breaks, they just throw it out and buy a new one.  None of them bother to learn how to fix things anymore!""

That's because most products that are produced today are not engineered to be fixable.  They're intended to have a limited shelf life so that you keep buying new ones.  It's called planned obsolescence.  And even if you DO try to fix something, the parts may be so difficult or expensive to get that it's easier/cheaper to just buy a new one.  Appliances are a good example of this.

So yeah, the next time a boomer criticizes you for not fixing your phone, hand it to them and ask them to fix it.  They know how to do it.  Right?"

But stories written by women following female characters and women's life experiences are ""stories of womanhood"" and ""speak to the women's experience.""

The whole ""men shouldn't hit women"" thing is a crock of BS.

If a woman is whaling on a dude and won't cut it out, and he punches her back to get her to stop, sorry but that's her own damn fault, she brought that shit on herself. Obviously this applies to every gender, but I'm real tired of women being seen as the victims when they were the instigator and the dude was just trying to defend herself. 

Obviously no one should be hitting anyone, I am very anti-violence and people should do everything they can to diffuse a situation without resorting to violence themselves. But sometimes that just doesn't work and you gotta just give someone the good ol' one-two to get them to stop.

Don't get me wrong, I don't think women should ever be shamed for liking sex or having sex, but I don't agree with sex-positive's claims that every sex act is harmless. The prevalence of degrading sex acts against women (with the purpose to degrade, not just something that someone might find degrading. for instance, I like facials and do not find them personally degrading because I asked for them-I like seeing cum- and know my boyfriend absolutely hates the idea of degrading women, but I also respect that many women don't like them and strongly believe they should never be pressured into them!), while fine on an individual level between consenting adults, do reinforce negative stereotypes and sometimes play into rape culture on a societal level. I'm not saying anyone should stop doing what they like in the bedroom, but I wish people would acknowledge this. I don't claim that I'm empowering women by wearing make up or shaving my legs. I'm 21 and it seems like most feminists my age are third wave rather than second wave, which makes me feel out of place. My parents are both second wave feminists, so I grew up thinking it was normal to be critical of the way women are treated in some porn/critical of human trafficking. 

I also get annoyed how any critical thinking about where a man's kink for degrading women may come from is automatically labeled ""kink-shaming."" We don't live in a vacuum, people! "
100,"And then they get all upset when all the sex disappears after a certain point (usually marriage, engagement, or babies).

101,"I remember my Asian-American female friend and her biracial now ex-boyfriend arguing over whether women or black people have it worse in the U.S. First off, it's not a fucking pissing contest you idiots. Secondly, I got so enraged with the fact that they weren't grasping that you can be both black and a woman. I hear it all the time, people comparing women issues with black people issues as if black women just don't exist. As if we don't have our special little disgusting blend of racism and sexism. Not only are we ignored by feminists but we seemed to be ignored by black activism too, because people tend to focus on issues black men face. All in all, I just feel ignored.

My absolute favorite thing about my pets is that they are besties. We've had the dog for four years and the cat for two. When we adopted the cat, I was really worried that they wouldn't get along, but in less than a day they were playing and [taking naps together](http://imgur.com/a/pViaL). They will do this little ""hide and seek"" thing where the cat hides under the couch and the dog runs around barking at her, and the cat will always run out the opposite side so the dog can chase her. They play fight with each other just like two puppies or kittens might do. It's insanely adorable.

Sometimes my boyfriend will go visit family for the weekend and take the dog, while the cat and I stay behind. The cat gets REALLY distressed and will sit at the door and wail because she misses her doggy friend. I really worry about what will happen when the dog passes away. The cat is super attached to her."

*Thank you for your kind words, everyone. It's something that's not spoken of in my family, which made me become very distant and self-reliant, so it's nice to hear some encouragement.

120,"Not the mom in this story, but the child. When I was around 4 or 5 my mom devised a plan to scare/surprise my dad on April Fools day. She filled a coffee mug with ice water, and told me to bring it to my dad in the tub, and pretend it was coffee. Then, instead of handing it to him, I was supposed to dump it on his head and run out, which I gleefully did. I'll never forget the look on his face. At first he thought he was about to get burned, and then he went wide eyed with shocked by the cold.
When I ran back in to the kitchen, her and I immediately doubled over with laughter listening to his yells from the bathroom.

Edit: Just to make sure no one thinks this was in bad taste, after my dad let the shock ware off, we went to check on him, and he laughed with us. No one was really upset. Keep in mind, this is the guy who pretended to cut off his finger one April Fools day, fake blood and all, which I also helped him with."
121,"Sorry to hear, OP. That totally sucks, were you guys together long? It's so cowardly to break up over text. My first boyfriend broke up with me via Facebook...he changed his relationship status to ""it's complicated"" on my birthday. It was really confusing because we saw each other earlier that day and I had no idea anything was wrong. 

My tips:

* Get rid of their things. You can put them in a box and donate/have someone return them to your ex. Just get them out of your house.

* Comfort yourself: eat your favourite foods, sleep in, cry as much as you want to, lean on your friends and family. 

* Treat yo self. Within reason, of course. I, for some reason, always change my hair after a break up. Not drastically, but I'll get something different done. It makes me feel like a whole new woman. 

* Get lost in a book or TV series.

* Focus inwards and invest in yourself: what's something you would like to change/improve in yourself? 

* Check out something new. It can be a new hobby, travel destination, etc. Just do something new.

* Go out and meet new people after you've done some grieving (if the relationship warrants grieving). Doll yourself up and let yourself feel like a million bucks :) "
122,"I'd say how much a danger other men can be.  There have been many many times - both online and in real life - where I have voiced my fears or concerns about safety or what not, just to have it dismissed by some dude as ""it's not that bad"" or ""where are you at on the internet that people send you rape threats? No one does that""


Why exactly would I make this shit up?  Do you think I like having that constant voice in the back of my mind whispering that I'm constantly in peril?  That I like seeing half the population as a potential attacker? That I like strange men asking me if I know how to fight and defend myself bc I don't look like I do?  That I like having random guys tell me they could murder me?

And I'm typically better equipped than most to combat an attacker and dispose of the evidence.  I can't imagine how much worse it is for tiny little petite women.


Anyway, women immediately understand when I say someone is giving me bad vibes.  Dudes laugh it off as paranoia and spout some shit about judging people. "

I was really into math and science when I was a kid. I used to make my mom draw me up pages of simple long division questions for me to do at a very early age. I really just loved the way numbers fit so perfectly. I also was certain I was going to be an entomologist.

In grade 4, 5 &amp;6 I had a had a male teacher for science and math. He was also the gym teacher. He very obviously favored the boys. Girls would never be called on to answer questions. He'd address the boys for the whole class, and say things like ""oh the *girls* won't know about this"" in a sing-sing voice. He also ran the 'gifted' program, which, coincidentally, was all boys. My parents and a couple teachers thought I would've been a great fit for the program, but I guess he thought otherwise. Two of my close friends got to be in it, and I remember taking to them after their classes about all the cool experiments they got to do while we were memorizing times tables.

 I vividly remember his many comments about how boys brains are meant for math and science, and girls simply were not. I very quickly lost interest, and though now I am trying to learn more, I think a lot about what my life would be like if I continued to be so passionate about math and science. Fuck that teacher. "

I'm told that dating is to get to know someone, so I see no reason not to use it to do just that. So if something is a dealbreaker for you and something you can reasonably expect a lot of people to have, it's a good time to ask the date about it. And if there is something about *you* that you can reasonably expect to be a dealbreaker for a lot of people, that information needs to be put out there.

Old folk don't realize how easy everything was back when they were young. Wanted a college education? All it cost you was part time work. Wanted a decent car and a livable house? All it took was one earner. Wanted access to decent and inexpensive health care? That came with easy to get jobs.

Now, few people have all of that. It takes two wage earners longer hours to bring home less. The average household income has been dead flat since the **1970's**, while the cost of living has gone through the roof. The reason why many aren't buying houses or cars is because they are trying to pay off student loans to get flat-assed paying jobs that wouldn't have been adequate in the *early* 90's.

I think the whole sex work, porn, and casual sex positive talk is really dangerous and irresponsible. I don't think anyone seriously chooses sex work/porn and feels ""powerful"" doing it and being used. It blurs the lines of consensual sex when it being paid for. Those industries are mainly male consumers/producers abusing and degrading women. It doesn't stop sex trafficking and encourages the view of women as objects and sex as ""not a big deal"".

It's not a man's job to stay sober to protect a drunk woman from herself.  It might be regrettable, but it's really not hard to go out and not get wasted.  I'm 37 years old and have never been drunk.  Sure, people get drugged, and those cases are definitely rape, but I think the vast majority of regretted sex is a result of willfully drinking too much and I think people need to take responsibility for that."

Most women are uncomfortable with sex workers, and although they probably don't mean us any harm, it's painful for them to think about us for more than a few seconds, so they push us and our narriatives away and allow feminists who hate us to control the conversation, resulting in policies like the nordic model that perpetuate violence against me and my colleagues.

We were hosting guests last summer and one of my BIL's made a comment about ""can't you sit down and relax with us??"" Well, no, I can't because an extra 6 people in the house means more laundry/ dishes/ folding/ making coffee for the morning/ rolling joints/ hiding said joints from kids' view... all the stuff that is a hassle if I don't do it, but somehow you think that taking out the trash is on par with all the other stuff that goes into making a household run.

It's just annoying to constantly feel like you don't exist, lest it be for a negative stereotype or caricature of yourself. From a creative point of view, it's horrible that your skin has so much influence on your career if you're actor, director, etc. With so few lead roles for POC in big box films, what ladder is there to actually climb for the rest of us?"
182,"Well, I've had too many guys get too tense when I dress nice. It's hard to have a conversation and get to really know them. Also, I got very tired of trying to look nice and being met buy the guy wearing any old pair of jeans and any old tshirt. So, I've started dressing very casually.

But I'm talking to this guy I really like and I'm gonna do my best to knock him out. ;)"
183,"When random guys I've just met/ been introduced too feel the need to prove they are 'tougher' than me. Example: In the middle of a conversation the guy told me he would stab my hand with a fork. Then proceeded to try and get me to put my hand out. Then laughed because I was 'scared'. Yea craziness, and threatening me with random violence doesn't make you seem like a ""cool"" guy.... What is this bs?"
184,"Nope.

Most people don't take negative feedback well. They want to argue. I don't want to argue, I just want it to be over.

I have absolutely nothing to gain from telling them something negative about themselves that they may or may not be able to change."

My biggest salary increases came from promotions. If you want to make the big bucks without having to go into a certain field, aim for management. "

193,"I find some things that are done and called ""feminist"" as baffling. I don't get things like ""free the nipple"" and ""slutwalks."" I understand the idea behind them and in an ideal world, sure it'd be nice, but it really just seems like a safety concern. And I don't think it's effective. It's nothing I'd feel safe participating in even if I wanted to. And I am reluctant to say there are more important issues because I feel like that can be used as a silencing mechanism, but really, there are more crucial and life/quality of life issues. and I feel like the focus is not on those things.

Also: 

1. Tangentially related, but I think mainstream feminism largely ignores WOC and intersectional issues. And lower income women

2. I think sometimes legitimate issues that men (as a whole, or men of color specifically) face are dismissed and viewed as irrelevant."
194,"My 3 year old likes to 'scare' daddy, so when we see him walk up to the house after work, we hide in the hallway and 3yo jumps out and growls and my sweet husband jumps and pretends to be frightened each time.  

My dad used to work at a car dealership, and one day while I was visiting him after school,  he grabbed a new Mustang for a test drive and we went home to tell mom he bought it for her. We kept up the ruse until she started phoning people to tell them, then we had to tell her it was a prank. She didn't talk to us for a few days,  and my dad kept the couch warm for a while. "
195,"Jesus.. that's pretty fucking terrifying.

202,"My partner was my best friend. I know you hear it a lot, I know its probably true, but we were homeless together. We ran away from home, we grew up together. We learned about life, and about each other, we grew successful together. All the things you learn from life, whether it be school, or parents, or relationships, we learned from each other, and that made us....idk. He was a part of me. He truly was, my best friend. 

And then he died. And quite honestly, I never got over it. I function, but there really is a part missing from me and it has been years. And I am with someone else, whom I love, but I will never love anyone like I loved him. When I lost him, we were no longer dating. I knew I never wanted to marry him, but knowing that he isn't in this world... I fought to not kill myself. Him not existing in this world was enough to no longer exist too. A part of me really did die when he died. 

I have no advice. I'm sorry. Nothing that would really *do* anything. If there is someone who knows her well, if she has someone else who is very close to her, ask them what you can do. It might be food, and that person makes her eat. Maid service, laundry. The basic everyday things....you just don't do them. They just aren't priority. "

I think there should be far greater of an attempt to gain more Asian American actors/actresses into more salient roles, especially if they're based around that background/lore. There are also huge uproars whenever it feels like black people get snubbed from roles or potential awards, I'd like to see that same level of support for asian people as well dawg."

219,"- I don't think that you have to be intersectional. It doesn't mean you are heartless or evil. It just means there is one issue you care about most, and that is deeply personal to everyone.

- I don't agree that a woman should be picked for a job just to fulfill a quota or diversity schemes. If a man is better for the job, he should get it.

- I refuse to use feminism to be offended. 

- The fat acceptance movement is deeply flawed and promotes an unhealthy lifestyle. And I say this as an overweight woman. It's okay to love yourself as you are--fat people should be happy, and we have worth too. But to demand that the world cater to us because of our unhealthy lifestyle smacks of extreme first world privilege and a warped view of the world."

But I swear SO many pictures seem to look the same-hyper contoured, full plump lips, makeup to the 9s, almost doll like. Any imperfections have been completely erased and it's almost eerie.

234,"I have idiopathic hypersomnia, which is very similar. Constant tiredness, sleep that isn't refreshing, no known cause, brain fog, etc.

I'm 23 years old and work an 8:30-5 M-F job. I don't do much after work because I'm so exhausted and by the time Friday rolls around, I usually pass out by around 8 PM. I also sleep close to 10 hours a night if I can and still struggle throughout the day. Coffee helps a little, but I have to limit it because too much caffeine makes me anxious. I don't exercise as much as I should and it has definitely affected my social life because I don't like staying out as long as other people (if I can make myself go out at all).

I don't have too much advice for coping, unfortunately. I mostly just try to push through and do some little tricks throughout the day when I'm too exhausted to keep working. Drink cold water constantly, get up and take a walk outside for some fresh air, try to keep good posture and not slouch, stand up and work at my desk rather than sitting."
235,"My best friend accidentally sent me, what I'm assuming to be, a nude picture. She immediately blocked me on snapchat, and texted me something along the lines of ""I blocked you on snapchat because I sent you something you shouldn't see.""

237,"Just be there. I'm coming up on the 9th year and it's still so  hard. Look into ""complicated grieving"". For me, the first year and a half, I was in shock. Coming out of it was hell. Be patient. Don't push her into ""getting over it"" by saying she'll find someone else, or she still has a life to live, or self help books. She needs something to hold onto. For me it was the unknown. I don't know what happens after we die, so if I killed myself, I had no idea if I'd be with him or not. Now, it's that I wouldn't want my worst enemy to feel this pain, so I'm not going to put my family through it purposefully. Help her with basic survival. Food, water, rest."
238,"Hi!! I'm an apprentice electrician, I work on trains mostly but have done other ""normal"" sparky work too (houses and stuff). I love it. I was a restaurant manager before and I was killing myself with stress. I love the technical aspect. It's not for dummies (though some people would think that) and it pays very well. The one thing you have to remember is every workplace is different. Some places will treat you like a piece of shit because you are female, and you don't have to put up with that. It's not just for ""manly"" women. I have always been into boyish stuff, but I still love makeup and lots of girly things. I have a female coworker (also electrician) who is basically a princess, wears heaps of makeup to work, thinks she's gods gift to men, and you would think that there's no way she'd be suited to the job. Well, you don't have to be a type. It can be very rewarding. 

I heard a lot of ""it'll be hard work"" or ""you really have to prove yourself as a female"" from men. Fuck that. Be who you are. Work hard because you want to. If that job isn't working for you, find something with a company that fits you more. Don't quit an entire career because there's a bunch of dudes who make you uncomfortable. 

Sometimes you have to be aware that there are some men who aren't used to working with women. For example, I am currently pregnant. Most guys are really good to me, if something is too much for me I'm not afraid to say it, even if I get made fun of. I had a meeting with HR about my maternity leave, almost halfway through my pregnancy. He said congratulations, then asked me if I was keeping it. He was completely serious. I laughed it off but when I went and told me co-workers, they were shocked and said I should have said something. What I'm sort of getting at is don't be afraid to rock the boat because you're female. I've spoken up about lots of issues, hiring more women, having more toilets, etc. 

This turned into a rant but don't let a male dominated industry turn you off. There are so many different trades and industries to work in, I'm sure you'll find something you enjoy. Good luck! Btw I'm in Australia so if you have any more specific questions don't be afraid to ask."

240,"A career for women (especially in STEM) is always secondary, or a hobby. I have had quite a few men complain to me that me or my female friends are taking away opportunities from them, because soon enough we are going to forsake my career in favor of building a family.

250,"Unpopular view? Conservative and libertarian women can be feminists, and telling them they're not feminists is denying them their own agency."
251,"To address your first point... I think I semi agree? There's a big push in social justice communities (especially on tumblr) that as soon as anyone/anything does anything problematic, they have to be dropped immediately, criticised into the ground, and never talked about positively again, which I think is hugely damaging. I've seen this a couple of times recently with regards to Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's transphobic comments. Like, this is a hugely successful, WoC feminist. Yes, criticise her comments, try and get her to learn/apologise, but don't discredit all the work she's already done for feminism and for women. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that in my opinion it's necessary to critically examine society and media, but as long as those criticisms aren't completely ignored, it's absolutely okay to continue to enjoy whatever it is. Marvel films have a history of being ridiculously sexist, and while it's jarring and annoying at times, for the most part I still really enjoy them. "

A few months later we rematch on Tinder and he proceeds to annoy the shit out of me and I unmatch him. I end up going to a restaurant with my roommate and we sit at the bar - what I didn't realize was that he was sitting in the seat next to me.  

He turns and realizes I'm next to him and I say hello because I'm an adult. Anyhow, he proceeds to yell ""WHY DID YOU UNMATCH ME ON TINDER!????"" - mind you he's obviously on another date (and he interrupts her mid conversation to yell at me). 

It was so dumb and weird. My roommate told him to shut the fuck up and the bartender came over to ask if everything was okay. "

I don't relate to wage-gap feminism, or feminism seeking to increase women's representation as CEOs, on company boards, etc. It doesn't touch my concerns, it doesn't speak to me, and I'm not sure I see it as feminism - yes, it's pushing to empower a very select group of women, but it's also buying into economic and political systems that ensure the oppression and marginalisation of many, many more.

270,"It's not new, it's just back. It was super popular when I was in highschool too (early 2000s/late 90s), they used to sell straps you could replace your bra straps with that were cuter--like coloured ones or patterned ones. I remember my friend had one that was like a crocheted daisy chain and I thought it was really cute. Fashion is cyclical.

As for my personal opinion, I am happy about it. I can't go braless, it's uncomfortable for me at my size, but I also like styles that are off the shoulder or low-cut. I like that I don't have a ton of people whispering ""pssst! your strap is showing!"" now. 

I do understand where you're coming from, though. I also grew up very conservative and even attended a college with an intense dress code (everything had to have a sleeve seam, no tank tops, even in summer). Just embrace it--if you like having your bra straps show, then show them, otherwise, just know it's a fad, it will probably be gone soon and return in another 15 years or so. "

For example, I'm Latina and I grew up watching the same character over and over: a ""spicy"", gossip-obsessed, loud caricature whose defining trait is her sexuality. There wasn't exactly a lack of Latina characters, but they fell under the same stereotypes. Besides, there's a huge misconception in Hollywood about the physical aspects as well. They seem to think we all have dark skin, straight dark hair and similar facial features, basically keeping black or white Latinas out of the conversation. I'm so glad that's starting to change now though."

What does that say about his priorities? "
277,"I don't think every feeling should be shared with your SO about your relationship. That's not what I prefer. If my SO considered breaking up with me after a fight, I wouldn't want to hear about it unless he's serious. Like if he still considers it after he calms down, then I would want to hear.

287,"Argh! I actually recently had a conversation with my SO about abortion. He made some comment about how he thought it was a good thing that there was a waiting period in some states, e.g. you're made to watch an ultrasound and given information about abortion and then have to wait 24 hours. 

He *genuinely* thought this was a good thing because it's a big life decision. I freaked out on him a little bit before calming down and explaining the negative impact this has on women. His response? ""Hmm, I never really thought about that before."" 

Man I love my SO, but I was so mad. Not necessarily just at him, but at the greater problem. Many (most?) men never really *think* about these situations. Actually, many privileged women don't either. "
288,"I actually prefer them, especially for a first date. They're low-key and low pressure, so it's easier for me to talk to my date and get to know them.

I'd recommend going somewhere they also serve tea, hot chocolate, or even smoothies, since not everyone drinks coffee, of course.

Edit: a word"
289,"&gt; I also don't think that to call yourself a feminist, every choice has to be a feminist choice.

This is an attitude I see a lot on sites like Tumblr, where feminist discourse has a way of devolving into this performative routine where you constantly have to prove you're doing feminism correctly at the risk of being dog-piled on (or ""called out,"" if you prefer).

It's like there's no room to be an imperfect human being. You either have to be the most feministy feminist in the room, or you're out of the movement."
290,"Ask yourself if you would find it strange to see a Senate composed of 80 percent women. And a female president. Most world leaders are also female. The majority of movies you watch have female leads, and crowd scenes on TV depict one man for every four or five women. Most authors you see at the bookstore are female. So is your boss, or if not her, then your boss' boss. The company owner is almost definitely a woman. 

Meanwhile, an afternoon visit to the park or the grocery store would reveal where all the men are -- watching rich career women's children for them. Running errands, picking the kids up from school, getting home in time to prepare dinner. 

Would that seem like bizarro world to you? It probably would because we have so internalized and normalized the image of ""man as default"" that even women see the world that way. We make up half the population but are generally underrepresented in the public sphere, except where we fill a decorative or domestic role.

304,"The idea that millenials want ""instant satisfaction"" or being unable to delay gratification. There's this narrative that millenials growing up with technology, with overbearing 'everyone wins' mentality parents and schooling etc. makes millenials unable to wait for things. Hence why they're not saving up, they're spending money on big trendy purchases and having lots of casual relationships and sex.

I don't really buy it. I think there's a blame game going on here and although I think there are symptoms of instant satisfaction, the underlying issues aren't brought up. Millenials can't save for big purchases like a house because they don't earn enough and can't afford inflated housing prices. Millenials don't have the security to start a family so there is a lot more dating.

She was upset because it was nighttime and the mall was closing, so she had to wait outside alone where she was being catcalled by random men.  Everyone was agreeing with the guy and saying the girl was wrong for saying her original destination was ""right off of the freeway"" and she was a sheltered snowflake for not being able to deal with the catcalling at the mall.

Rothfuss does an amazing job at building a great fictional world and explaining the rules behind its magic.

324,"&gt;I don't feel that men need a sex positive movement the same way people of other genders do, because men aren't made to feel shame about their sexuality

I just want to offer a differing opinion. I feel like men are often shamed for expressing attraction, even if it was expressed in a healthy way, just because that attraction was unwanted.

In general I think men absolutely need a sex positive movement. It would benefit men and also other genders, as men would be more likely to be comfortable in their sexuality and others'. A sex positive movement for men that would teach them how to express attraction in a healthy way (and teach them that it's ok to be rejected) would also be more effective in combating harassement/assault etc than some of the current trends of demonizing men's sexuality altogether."

Sexy dress, shaved everything, big hair that I took an hour to style and perfect makeup. After a while I found that it set the wrong stage. They were nervous and fidgety and I wasn't able to relax in the tight scrappy dresses I wore. So now, first dates are leggings or skinny jeans, booties, and loose top with no cleavage showing and light make up. If we actually like each other I sexy it up a bit more on the second date, and then by the third date I try to knock them out! By then he should know if he likes my personality and we have a good time together and I can show him I also know how to look really pretty when it's appropriate."
328,"I agree, with the added caveat that a person shouldn't use more force than necessary. There's often a noticeable strength differential and so caution must be used to avoid unnecessary force.

He called frequently to check in, had me come to their place often so I wasn't alone. He just overall really took care of me. 

During this time, i got this idea that I wanted to take a solo trip, which I'd never done before. I was originally thinking of finding a road trip, but my dad convinced me that Amtrak might be easier- mainly because I don't have a car, and I'd have the freedom to rest/sleep as much as I want along the way. My dad helped a lot with the planning and seemed really excited for me. Once we picked the dates, he said something like ""you know, if you push it back one more week, I could go with you"". He was not pushy about it *at all*, but I could just tell he really wanted to come. I really wanted to have the solo trip experience, but I realized I might not have many opportunities to take a trip like this with my dad again, so I decided to ask him to to come with. He was THRILLED! I don't think I've ever seen him so happy. 

That trip was he best trip I've ever had in my life. It was just he and I, and it totally changed our relationship. We talked a lot and opened up about a lot of things, and he honestly just totally turned into my best friend. It's just one of those moments that I know l cherish forever. 

We spent 5 days on a train together. Two days in Portland, two days in San Francisco. It was unforgettable. Since then, he's retired and has taken several train trips with my mom. It's totally his ""thing"" now. He loves it so much, and I'm so happy that I was able to open him up to that. 

The trip totally changed our relationship and I'm so, *so* thankful for that. "

345,"I consider myself sex positive, but I'm really cautious about cis men in sex positive spaces for the reasons you mentioned. I don't feel that men need a sex positive movement the same way people of other genders do, because men aren't made to feel shame about their sexuality and their sexuality isn't co-opted like people of other genders. I am active in the kink community, the polyamory community, and the sex worker community, but I try to mostly attend women's only spaces and events.

Also, speak up against sexist men in your life. When you're in all-male spaces, don't laugh at or go along with misogynistic or sexist talk.

365,"Related to this: I hate the trope that men aren't ""allowed"" to be emotional but women are.

The fact that women are *dismissed* as being emotional is not a perk.  The fact that women are considered less fit for leadership because of our supposed softness and volatility is not a privilege.  The fact that women are constantly portrayed as easily frightened, frequently weeping, and overcome to the point of helplessness is not some kind of amazing bonus of womanhood.

Further, women are actually very restricted in which emotions we're allowed to have and how we're permitted to show them.  My male coworkers can huff and grumble and even raise their voices in frustration, but if I show anything other than a sweet smile in the face of a problem I will get asked what my problem is and why I'm ""being bitchy.""  I live in a sports town and see grown men do everything from sobbing to flipping cars over their team's performance, yet women who cry at movies are still the subject of jokes. And god help any woman who dares experience the emotion of lust, which our culture has declared to be Dudes Only. "

The movie needed ""star power""? Ghost in the Shell is fucking 30 years old and just by the nature of the story, most of the characters are pretty flat, so I don't think there's anything Scarlett Johansson could've brought to the role that any other moderately talented actress couldn't have, of which there are PLENTY of Asian descent.

The same woman said the way to substitute eggs in a cake is to simply add more butter, like it's that simple. She's never baked a cake in her life, I've been baking since I was ten. I avoid her now, she's all kinds of stupid and I have no patience for it. "
381,"NSFW_GIF, the bits of a video you were going to skip ahead to anyway."
382,I'm interested in nursing. What would you say are some of the main differences between RNs and NPs? In terms of responsibilities and the job itself 
383,"Tha pain of finding the right birth control and how absolutely frustrating\expensive it can be.

Currently on the implant and I've been bleeding for 48 days straight! :D 

And of course birth control affects every woman differently. While this is shitty for me it may work fantastic for others."

385,It seems like literally everything women do is sexualized. It's depressing that almost everything we do can in some way be tied to our looks. At the gym it's attention seeking if we wear form fitting clothes or it's ugly if we don't. Female politicians are ridiculed if ugly or old..Not even gonna list everything that comes to mind but I don't see a situation where women aren't in some way tied to a sexual function or desire.
386,"All the great people I've known: they have empathy, generosity, loyalty &amp; integrity, and injustice makes them rage. "
387,"When I came back to the US after being in Asia a couple times, I was suddenly hyper-aware of how many people were overweight. You don't notice it in your daily life living here because it's so normal. It wasn't just the US either. My connecting flight was through London Heathrow and the shock hit me first there."
388,"I had a friend like this. I eventually had to just cut her off; I didn't enjoy spending time around her or talking to her, so what was the point in continuing the friendship? It wasn't even friendship at that point, she seemed to genuinely enjoy me but I felt like I was being dishonest by pretending to like her. I felt bad because I had known her for a long time, but I didn't feel like there was anything else I could do about it."
389,Holy shit. That was escalated quickly!
390,"people prompting you into asking them a question instead of just telling you what the hell they think is so important.

you know, they'll be behind your back audibly going ''hmm'' or ''huh'' or ''woah'' in an endless loop until you ask them what.

spit. it. out. goddamn. if they stall and continue to irl clickbait even after i ask ''what'' i will almost spew fire."
391,Get really lucky.
392,"Yes,  which tickled her even more.   "
393,This goes double for every Travis.
394,"I doxxed someone once.

I was having a conversation with them in the comments, and I got curious. How much can you find out about a person online? So I opened an incognito browser and got to work.

Turns out, you can find out a *lot* if a reddit user isn't careful. I found out their age, their address, their full name, and started coming across social media profiles.

Then I took a big step back, realised what I was doing, and closed the browser.

This was about 2 years ago now. It was eye opening."
395,"Remind her that her SO is remembered. My best friend in undergrad lost his wife ~6 months after they were married. He said that that he always appreciated when someone would send a short text on anniversaries, whether it was birthday/wedding/funeral just to know that he wasn't the only one thinking about her. I've heard similar sentiments from parents who have lost their children."
396,"Actually, dentists have one of the highest rates of suicide out of any medical profession. "
397,"Honestly, I find it kind of sad in the same way I find it kind of sad when someone says that high school is the best time of your life or college is the best time of your life. If I'm lucky, I have 100 years of life on this world. I'd hate to think that I am supposed to spend the last 70ish of them thinking a decade in my youth overshadowed everything before or since."
398,"Plus, it's been shown that participation trophies and the like actually *lower* a person's self esteem, because kids are more perceptive than we give them credit for, and they can see that not everyone did as well as everyone else. So when everyone gets a ""trophy,"" the kids who know they did poorly see it as devaluing the reward for the group, and they feel bad about it, and the kids who did well see their work being valued the same as everyone else's, so they don't see themselves as better than anyone else. Praise becomes meaningless when everyone gets it, and you end up with exceptionally talented kids who think they're average or even below average."
399,Do these men actually exist in real life? I've only heard of them on the internet but never actually encountered one out in the wild. 
400,"""SWWEEEEEEEEEEEET CAROLIIIIIIIINE BAA BAA BAAAAAA.""

I fucking hate that song so much."
401,"This is how I feel about Ashley's. Just awful. 


I'm sure there are nice ones out there but .... I have yet to meet them. "
402,"&gt;AND WE LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER. 

And why shouldn't you? What I take away from your first date:

1. You try to be hot. 

2. You can be low maintenance without freaking out. 

3. You started to rip off your clothes in his apartment. "
403,"Any time I have to take more than one shower in a day it makes me extremely upset.  

Stepping in water with my socks on."
404,in the later stages of a relationship (we'd been together a couple years at this point) one of my exes told me he initially thought I wouldn't make a good girlfriend because I slept with him on the first date. I mean...a) we'd known each other for about 6 months prior to this date and b) I don't like to dance around playing coy and whatnot when I could be getting laid and also c) he didn't seem to have any complaints at the time or express wanting to wait soooo
405,"Pads, because tampons are painful, messy and difficult to remove (for me at least).  I'm not okay with blood and pads are hard enough to deal with as it is."
406,You can pull off a long skirt with a fitted top. Sort of a spring/summer thing.
