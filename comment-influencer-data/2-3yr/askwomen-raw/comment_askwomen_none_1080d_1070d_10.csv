0,"My husband thinks he was sneaky last year buying me an oven for Christmas and then hooking it up Christmas Eve while I slept. 

I found the oven a week prior since I had to run to our storage unit for something and that's where he had hid it (to be fair, I hadn't been to the storage unit for like six months, so it was a good plan). I didn't sleep because he was making such a racket moving the old oven out and the new one in.

Oh well. I acted shocked and let him have his win. "
1,The image of somebody trying to hide an entire oven from somebody who lives in their house is unbelievably cute and funny.
2,"My fiance works in the science field and likes data/proof of things. He's also secretly a big giant marshmallow, despite being a six foot tall giant alpha male. 

So anyway, we adopted a rescue kitten a few months ago and he loves her.... spoils her rotten, asks me to send kitty pics all the time when he's working, etc. 

I found out he googled ""how do I know if my cat loves me"" . SO FRICKING CUTE. He needed the scientific proof that our cat loves him as much as he loves her. "
3,Bobby pins. My ex kept putting them all in his toolbox because he thought they were a tool. I found dozens of them in there lmao
4,"Trying to write them as empowering is the mistake to me. Write interesting stories with fully developed characters. I don't need to feel ""empowered"" by a fictional character. I'd rather she be relatable or interesting to read about. "

6,"My husband has our wedding song on his spotify playlist (the one I walked down the aisle to, not the first dance). Whenever it pops up and I'm nearby, he immediately skips it and mumbles something about how it's too sappy and he should really take it off. 

He doesn't know I know he skips it because it makes him cry every time he hears it.

It's especially cute to me because before we got married I'd told him that my favorite part of any wedding is when the bride emerges. Everyone turns to look at her but I ALWAYS look at the groom because his look of joy and pure emotion gets to me. If he cries I just melt. Hubby assured me that he's just not a crier. He almost never cries, and certainly doesn't in front of other people if he can help it. He was really worried I'd be hurt that he didn't cry on our big day. But the moment he saw me he burst into tears (which of course made me follow suit... god bless waterproof mascara). "
7,"Someone you actually like and get along with early on 




It seems like so many dudes want a girlfriend so badly they would rather date whoever will go out with them rather than trying to date women they really enjoy spending time with. And then wonder a month later once they get to know the person, why they are incompatible.  



Don't try to find ""a girlfriend."" Don't be generic and look for someone to fill a role.  Try to find a woman you want to bring into your life rather than any person who will fill the role. "
8,"There isn't any problem really with a fat guy having a skinny girlfriend. But there is a problem in representation because often the guy is all-round pretty shitty and the woman is great and the moral is that even shit guys who are fat deserve great women... and women need to just settle for any guy. It's made worse by the fact that you almost never see it in reverse, an average or below average woman is very unlikely to end up with an above average man in any TV show or movie.

It's bad representation for overweight people since they're usually using fatness to indicate that the character is below average and lazy in other aspects, and it's a pretty sexist trope."
9,My clitoris... 
10,Yes. I'd sleep diagonally across the king size bed and enjoy every second of it
11,"SHE'S POWERFUL BECAUSE SHE USES HER SEXUALITY AS A WEAPON!

No, fuck off, you're just making excuses for showing excessive cleavage.  "
12,"1. Making her entire story revolve around a male character.  A well-written female character should have her own interests, goals and motivations.  She shouldn't exist solely to aid a male hero and her personality shouldn't be defined by her interactions with him.  

2. While an empowering female character can be sexy, the ""sexuality as a weapon"" types aren't empowering at all. Normal women don't want to think of their sexuality as a weapon.  Sexuality should be just another part of the character's personality, on the same level as her beliefs and goals.

3. Undermining her by putting her in a vulnerable situation that's specifically related to her gender.  Rape, threats of rape, loss of clothing, bondage with decidedly sexual overtones, etc.  Overcoming sexual vulnerability doesn't magically make a character strong, either.

4. The belief that a ""strong female character"" needs to be made less feminine and less attractive in some way, often by making her infertile, making her insane, giving her a case of raging daddy issues, or making her incapable of having normal relationships due to some past sexual trauma.

5. Making her unrealistically physically powerful.  A 90-pound waif with no muscles isn't going to be able to fight off 20 guys or swing a broadsword.  Don't be afraid to give your physically powerful female character some muscle.  Even in books written by women, it often feels like the reader is constantly being reminded of how pretty and delicate and cute the heroine is.

6. Character flaws that aren't really flaws, like clumsiness or wearing glasses or being a little bit too uptight. "
13,"He thinks I don't know where he hides gifts that he's bought for me. I found out cause he was giving me my birthday gift and I watched him pull it out of there. He tells me every holiday or birthday that he hid them in a new spot, but he hasn't. They're always in the same spot. I pretend I don't know."
14,"From the guy's side: My SO is dieting. I am not, mostly because I am bulking and need carbs.

After work, I'd occasionally stop by the grocery store, buy a pint of ice cream, and eat it in my car. You know, to avoid the whole issue of her staring at me angrily while I eat junk food in front of her. She's usually sleeping when I get back anyway. No big deal.

Here's the rub: I have a Drivewise. SO looked me up just to see how many hard braking events I had that week, as she's paying for the insurance, and noticed a bunch of times where I was stopping halfway and sitting there for 15-20 minutes before coming home.

Knowing me, she immediately discounted the ""is cheating on me"" possibility and confronted me one day with ""Are you stopping at the supermarket after work and eating ice cream in the parking lot?""

""... yes. How did you you- oh, the Drivewise.""  "
15,"Babies are constantly out to kill themselves for the first two years of life. Children continue trying to kill themselves after that, but less frequently."
16,"Somewhat? I would say the discouragement is still there but for different reasons. 

When men do ""feminine"" things they're often made fun of because it's assumed that feminism is less than masculine, and therefore a man is lowering himself or making himself effeminate (thus, ""bad"") by doing those things. There's also the homophobic assumption that a man who participates in feminine things is gay, and by that token, less of a man and therefore less good. 

With women doing masculine things, there are typically three roads someone will take in putting her down.

a.) She is going to be seen as less of a woman and therefore intimidating (a ""good"" trait) but this will scare away men and make her unmarriable - a woman's ultimate purpose and goal. So she needs to ""lower"" herself to be a woman and desirable to men.

b.) A woman who participates in masculine hobbies, professions, interests, etc is assumed to be doing so to either make a point (the feminazi) or to impress men (the fake geek girl.) She is considered to be insincere by default, and either actively hostile towards men or desperate for one. 

c.) Even if a woman is seen as being sincere in her ""masculine"" activity, she's assumed to be less capable. She's often questioned, belittled, ""mansplained"" to, or awkwardly put on a pedestal for being different (but is watched like a hawk for failure.) "
17,"Sheldon Cooper, from Big Bang Theory. He's selfish and demanding, and acts as though the other characters have an obligation to do whatever he wants. At the same time, he's never really there for others, at all. I know he struggles with empathy, but I also know that's not an excuse. Not having empathy can make it difficult to tell what others need or feel, but it doesn't mean not caring.

Also, he's an obvious stereotype of autism, which as an autistic person myself, I'm more than a little aggravated by."
18,Dudes in my life are routinely startled and baffled by my eyelash curler. 
19,"a lot of women are told they're just doing it to get attention from men. like the whole ""fake geek girl"" thing, where men think their dumb favorite tv show or game is so unique that no woman could possibly be interested in it, so they have to quiz you on really dumb facts nobody cares about."
20,"In my experience, the worst (and best in some situations) thing about not being conventionally attractive is that I'm completely invisible.  I don't get poor treatment from people because I'm not even acknowledged by them.

As for how to deal, I comfort myself by knowing that lots of people would choose invisibility as a superpower, and I already have it!"
21,"If I'm just getting a little teary eyed I book it to the bathroom to compose myself. 

If I really need to sob I go to one of our ""wellness rooms,"" - single-occupancy rooms for people that need to lie down if they're feeling ill, administer medication, take their blood pressure, pump breast milk, etc. The room has a recliner, a mirror, a sink and a locking door so it's a good place to go to cry it out. I can wash my face and fix my make-up afterwards and no one is the wiser."
22,"Okay one more: TOYS.  No matter how carefully you curate a stash of thrifted, vintage, all-wood toys, somebody will buy you a fucking ""learning table"" that screams colors in Spanish throughout the night.  Or a stupid dump truck that sings: *I'm a powerful DUMPTRUCK!!!!/I rumble down the road/moving my load from here to theeeeeere*.  And those toys will be your child's favorites."

24,Every back story involves some sexual assault.  Really?  Why is that the only thing people can think of that can make women strong?
25,"Flawless makeup/hair/clothes. Being very conventionally pretty.

I'm very insecure :c"
26,Obviously Calliou. 
27,"For example, my BF got really upset tonight after he stepped on this little piece of metal in our bathroom. He had no idea what it was or why it was in our bathroom. Turns out it was just the backing to an earring I had dropped last night. "
28,"I think it isn't just the overweight guys. Look at Adam Sandler movies. I don't find him attractive at all, but the women in his movies are usually extremely hot. How often is it the other way round? Basicly never. Even if the women is supposed to be unattractive they just give her an ugly sweater and glasses and that's it. And in the end she transforms from the ugly duckling to the beautiful swan anyway."
29,"5'9"". Not the tallest, but I'm taller than the vast majority of women I meet, and I'm eye level with most men (I'm the average male height in my area).

I do not let it affect my daily life, but life affects me when it doesn't have tall pants available. the only time it has affected relationships was when I was dating, and some men decided they would forbid me from wearing heels around them, while others would just be insecure in general about my height. To compensate, I wore 3"" heels on every single date.

[edit] Now that I've been the top comment for a while, I just wanna let everyone know that I really did do this and my current SO was also subject to my favourite 3"" boots on our first date. He is 5'6"" and not once have I ever wished he was taller than me, and neither has he. I wore my 6"" heels to his sister's wedding reception and I was the perfect height for motorboating. He does not have short-man issues and it's very wonderful. Our 4-year anniversary is coming up!"
30,Someone's played too much Fallout
31,"He bought an engagement ring sometime in July, I think. (I know he has the ring, I just don't know how long he's had it.) He came out of our computer room one afternoon and gave me this long look and then said ""I need to know something about you, but it's going to ruin the surprise. Is that okay?"" I already suspected what he was doing, so I told him to ask my sister whatever he needed to know--she would know pretty much everything about me. (And then I texted her my ring size so she had it just in case.)

A few weeks later, we were joking around about it. I didn't think he'd gotten it yet, because he's pretty bad about procrastinating and we're not in any super-hurry to get engaged (even though we've already kind of started planning the wedding). He went to his computer and took a picture of something, he said: ""So I have proof for later."" I figure he took a picture of the invoice or a shipping receipt or something.

I'm really excited to see the ring. I think he's starting to try to figure out ways to propose without making me suspicious: we've started hanging out at parks and stuff on nice days even though his phone is broken so he can't play Pokemon Go anymore. :)"
32,"So in your Facebook info section you can list nicknames. Basically the only way anybody will ever see your list of nicknames for yourself is if someone goes to that ancient part of the ""About Me"" page that lists your favorite quotes that nobody's updated since high school.

Six months ago, my partner and I were discussing the ""if we got married what would we do with our last names"" thing and after deciding hyphenating is wrong for us and he doesn't like his name and he wouldn't want to take mine (cause then he'd have two of the same harsh consonants in his name... eyeroll) that he really liked the idea of combining our last names into a new one in a specific way.

About a month ago I saw that my SO had, at some point since that conversation, updated his nickname to {SO FirstName} {CombinationOfOurLastNames}. He just did it, figuring nobody would ever see it, especially not me.

He was out of town for a couple days when I found it so I might have buried my face in his pillow to smell him while I bawled my happy little eyes out."
33,"I certainly can't totally ignore the poor treatment I get. As I've gotten older (middle-aged now), at least I rarely get overt insults on the street anymore -- these kept me almost confined to my house for most of my teens. But I definitely get ignored, sometimes even when I speak to people directly. And it is very lonely.

I deal with it, to the extent I can, by dressing up in bold, colorful ways, wearing heels (painful, but they help), and being very attentive to my posture and bearing in public. It sucks that I should need to be constantly aware of my body this way, but it does result in slightly more human/humane treatment from strangers. 

The loneliness, especially from not being able to date, but also from having few friends (most people don't want to be seen in public with someone who looks like me), is really hard. Some days it feels like a living death of sorts, honestly. I don't know what to suggest there."
34,That's an awful thing to say to a person 
35,[deleted]
36,"genuine compatibility with *you*. 

there's the obvious: don't look for people your friends will like, or your mom will like, or your family will like, or your peers/colleagues/whatever will like over what *you* will like, but it's not *just* this. too many people get caught up in a fantasy of what they're ""attracted"" to, while ignoring what kind of person is actually the most compatible with them. 

for example, i know many guys who like girls who are ""very fit."" fine. makes sense. pretty normal point of attraction. but the guys i'm talking about are not, themselves, fit. in fact, many of them are basically the opposite of fit. which is fine, and i'm not saying they should ""lower their standards"" (because, you know, anyone who is not fit is sub-par /s), but rather they should consider whether a girl who fits their ""attraction profile"" is really the kind of person who's going to be compatible with them. chances are, she's not. someone who spends a lot of time keeping in shape is probably not actually going to have that much in common with someone who never even takes a step in that direction. 

for a less emotionally-charged example, let's say a guy really likes girls who are career-driven and ambitious. that's sexy. that's fine. but it's worth taking a look at whether you, and the life *you* live, can realistically accommodate someone who's very extreme like that. i guess i just see a lot of people who ignore fundamental incompatibilities, like lifestyles, because they think the opposite of what they are is sexy. "
37,I think the writers and/or casting agents are lazy and trying to use an outdated formula that should have been left behind in the 90's.

You didn't kill the walker (which is good considering it wasn't one!), you could have killed one of the men running towards it, and you could have attracted every walker for miles around. Stupid!

Women are more flexible, but that means very little if the woman in question isn't trained in anything, and big flashy head kicks aren't the kind of thing you want to use in a real fight, anyways.

Sometimes I hadn't eaten all day and I would still puke, I puked bile and acid several times. It was completely awful. I also got a chronic illness during pregnancy.

The pregnancy, birth and the kind of baby you get are completely random. You can't ever be fully prepared for what's to come. Kids are the same, sometimes you can raise them very well but they can still be little shits. It's like Russian roulette.

72,"So I'm a guy and this is about my wife and my proposal to her. I wrote in a journal once the day I initially planned to propose to her, and since we lived apart I really never assumed that she would ever have a reason to look at it. 

When she was over, she decided to clean and it ""fell open"" at one point and she saw that date, in caps and assumed that it was when I was planning to propose. 

What she didn't know was that I was planning an extremely elaborate scavenger hunt adventure that appeared to be planned for us by a mutual friend because he lost a bet to me. She also didn't know that I bought the ring (all size, preference and details collected earlier by her friend) 9 months before then and I was too impatient to wait for my initial date. 

So although she assumed she knew my secret, she didn't know that I moved up the plan and took a 9 month plan of action and made it happen sooner just so I could ask her to be my wife. And the whole day she kept thinking, I wonder if he's behind this and wants to propose but then remembered the date she saw in my journal and talked herself out of thinking I was involved in the scavenger hunt adventure and it turned into a complete and total surprise. 

Proposal win!"

83,"first online date ever. nervous as fuck.

i meet the guy. he's shaved bald like in his pictures, and dressed in normal guy clothes. all seems well until he gives me a weak handshake and greets me with a trembling, granny-like voice. hookay, i shouldn't judge based on voice alone, let's do this. into the cafe.

we're making small talk, and he agrees with everything i say. i think he said about 5 times ''oh yes i agree! so we're a match then?''. at some point i notice his nails are painted. okay, well it would be kinda shallow to dismiss him because of that, let's go for a walk. he goes to the bathroom for a super long time and then emerges.

the stench of sweet, cloying, lavender-powdery grandma perfume makes me cough. he's wearing lip gloss and blush. still in the same dude clothes. welp, what harm can a little walk be?

on the way to the park, he tells me that he's looking for a mistress to peg him. he's only interested in sex that involves ''phallus''. he tells me he's not gay or trans but has a fetish for all things feminine. he snaps the bra he's wearing underneath his tee shirt suggestively. at this point it's too much and it's time for me to get away. 

i tell him i need to go shopping. he insists on coming with me so he can give me fashion advice, before i say i meant food (but he can suggest dinner ingredients!). he gives me the cling hug for way too long. we part awkwardly. then he specifically changes his route so that we ''just so happen'' to bump into each other again after saying goodbye.

bonus points: it's 4 years or so later and he works at the only pharmacy in town as a helper. last time i went, he left the cash register to personally fetch my yeast infections medicine, antidepressants, and birth control, all while desperately trying to make eye contact and get my attention. i stared at the table and wished i could just die."

99,"I've always been the least attractive in any group of women, and my way of dealing has always been to compensate with a sense of humor and/or by being really responsible and having my shit together in terms of job (or, in school, grades), finances, physical health and fitness, making plans, putting myself out there, etc. It has its pluses and minuses. 

On the one hand, I know I'm a functional human being. I tend to be the ""mom friend"" in any group I'm in, but I take that as a compliment. On the other hand... it really sucks to be ignored. It hurts to be the only one who has never been hit on in their life, who has always had to take 100% of the initiative when dating or asking anyone out, who has always had to lead with their personality or accomplishments instead of being able to be seen as a beautiful woman. 

And sometimes I just try to take the things that are insults and turn them into positives. A guy once told my friend that I looked like Adam Driver - whatever, Adam Driver is sexy. A bouncer once judged me the least attractive out of the group of girls I was with and wouldn't let me into a club on my friend's birthday - cool, well, at least I knew who my real friends were in that group (the 3-4 who refused to come in with me). I've never had any of my guy friends hit on me, as I hear is very common with women who hang out with guys a lot - well, I know they actually like me for my personality and aren't just waiting for a chance to get it in.

I was attempted raped once. The guy was pinning me down and seemed pretty confident. As we struggled I got my leg between us, placed my foot against his body and pushed him off me. 

Yeah, the male upper body is generally stronger than a woman's, but the strength of a woman's leg will usually exceed the strength of a man's upper body. And we're flexible enough to be able to utilize that strength. "
111,"I can never apply this to all men, but I can address an issue Ive had with young men (18-20s) when I was in the dating pool. I think a lot of young guys tend to see women as....how do I put it....something to aquire and possess. Something to fantasize about, like a story book romance. Someone to be your sex kitty and help you with your needs, and swoon when you try and meet her needs because theres no way you could fail at that. 

See a trend here? It strips the humanity off of us, and makes us seem more of a *thing*, or a character that isnt real.

Of course, young people, women and men, can both be guilty of this. I blame lack of experience and lack of perception.

I know what Im talking about may seem specific. This is just what Ive seen in younger guys. 

Im going to leave some stuff about how they approach hooking up out of this, because when I was in the dating pool I wasnt looking to hook up, I was looking for something more datey/companion-like so I am speaking for the negative parts of the crowds *I* delt with. 

But I did speak to some pretty respectable people too, of course.

So Id say it would be great if young men learned how to appreciate that when they are looking for someone to date, they should look for a human companion. Not fantasy.

For a woman, she has to think about the safety concern, the social stigma, the pregnancy/abortion concern, and if she's among the estimated 75% of women who can't orgasm from penetration alone, it has a high chance of being a subpar experience. Lots of bad possibilities. 

For men, it's pretty much the opposite of everything above. Lots of good possibilities.

I was still chicken but at least they couldn't stop me, right?  I'll never forget the nurse giving me a hug, telling me she was sorry I went through it without help, and that I should not for one minute think I was the only person at school to walk that path.

He planned a romantic proposal. His entire family was at his parents' house for a long holiday weekend. He got one of his sisters to hide a dozen long-stem red roses in the woods. We walked to one of our favorite locations, a memorial with sculptures and poetry. He had me sit in the center sculpture (it's allowed) and close my eyes.

When I opened my eyes, he was holding the roses. He made a short speech, then pulled the ring from his pocket and proposed. Of course, I said yes.

He thinks he completely surprised me. Really? He'd been acting like a nervous goon for months. He'd gone so far as to try on my rings and ask me what I liked in jewelry. Settings? Metals? Are diamonds important? It didn't take much to put it together.

He proposed with a simple, elegant platinum setting and suspended yellow sapphire. He chose the gem and the design himself. I love it.

And, yes, I acted totally surprised. It was a magical weekend. He'd even called my parents to tell them he was going to propose, so they were waiting for my call. (OK, I didn't expect that!) He was SO PROUD of himself.

When I insisted I was fine, she said, ""What, are you having sex or something?"" I paused awkwardly, and asked if that was a real question. I guess she didn't really expect that and had a weirdly calm, existential crisis. She went outside, smoked a cigarette and stared blankly into the darkness.

In A Song of Ice and Fire (books...not sure if they had that in the show) there was a part where Brienne of Tarth thought about something her teacher had said. I don't remember the exact words but the message was kind of like that: If you're a woman and you're fighting a man, this is your one big advantage. In his mind, the fight is already over, because *of course* he will win. His main concern is now simply to end the fight as quickly as possible, since he doesn't want to get mocked by his buddies for having trouble subduing a *woman*. This means he will come at you recklessly, with little regard for his own defense. With the right technique, this can be exploited.

166,"*All* the damn time. Some of these problems come from the fact that I identified as bisexual my whole life, and then when I came out as lesbian I got the following:

* Assuming lesbian means ""bisexual, but more into women"" (this happens 90% of the time)

* Saying I'm shallow for only liking one set of genitalia now

* Telling me no one is fully gay, everyone is bisexual even if it's 1% 

* Telling me I'm ""boxing myself in"", and that sexuality is fluid so it's likely to change anyway 

* I must have the male gaze (guy friends suddenly think it's okay to show me awful degrading porn, or assume I am dying to go to a strip club) 

* I must have been abused as a child or have daddy issues

* When they find out I *have* been sexually assaulted/raped, they go, ""Oh, is that why you're lesbian?"" 

* The reason feminism is such a part of the lesbian community is because we hate men

* We use strap-ons because we need penis 

* Not my personal experience, mostly directed to butch women: We hate men because we can't get men 

* Mostly directed to femme women: We're a ""waste"" of a woman because we won't fuck men


Why does it happen? Lesbians (and asexuals, although unfortunately most people don't even know they exist) are the only group of people on the planet who are not sexually available to men. I guess this is bound to come with issues. Ranging from anger to trying to come with an explanation for the unthinkable. 

Also the magic penis fallacy. Everyone must love penis. I could write an essay on why strap-ons =/= penis, but for me personally I don't even use toys, and never been with anyone who's even used a strap-on. So for one, let's dispense with the notion that we all use them. Or that we simulate hetero sex and relationships in general. 

On the sexual abuse link - it's true, many lesbians have been sexually assaulted. Maybe people look at statistics or anecdotal evidence, and draw a conclusion. But what they're totally missing is that many *women in general* have been sexually assaulted. Most of my straight friends have. It's horrifyingly common. So this isn't something that happens with lesbians specifically, or even more so with lesbians. But I think people just don't understand how common it is with women.  "

190,"Speaking from personal experience as an ugly woman, it's not that people ""don't want to be seen with you"" and run away from you on the street. It's more that people don't want to be around you in the first place so you never have that initial connection that others have when forming relationships. It took me a long time to realize why I had such a hard time making actual friends when I got along so well with everyone in my classes, work, extracurriculars, etc. People have never *hated* me, but it's more like I'm invisible. People generally seek out others who are like them and can have similar experiences. When people look at me, they see someone they can't take out partying or hanging out with guys or talking about dating/sex/relationships. It's odd how people seem shocked that I'm relatively ""normal"" when they get to know me better, because my appearance is so outside the norm of attractiveness (there is a difference between 'ugly' and 'average' or 'not beautiful' that people often erroneously group together). And, speaking from experience, there's a large number of men who don't see unattractive women as women at all and therefore social nonentities. The difference in how I see men treat women depending on their level of attractiveness would be mind-blowing if I wasn't so used to it. But again, it's that *initial* connection that doesn't happen, not ""sorry, you're an awesome person, but I can't possibly walk down a street with you."" "

Honestly, she's absolutely infuriating.  At the beginning of the series she's in her early 30's and coming back from South America and she's talking about her affairs and on and on, she shows martial arts training to protect herself which makes sense because she's a woman alone. 

And then she falls in love with Booth and..........she just falls the fuck apart. She can't handle emotions, she can't handle relationships, she can't take care of herself, she can't DO ANYTHING. 

She becomes just a former shell of her normal vibrant self and it's absolutely infuriating. How dare they write her entire life into ""I fell in love with MY MAAAAAN and now he protects me!""

193,I work as a nanny so I really can't cry at work. One day last February I had to put my dog down and right after had to go pick up the kids from school it was extremely hard not to cry. A few months later my boyfriend of two years broke up with me at work via text. The second I got into my car to leave I balled my eyes out.
194,"&gt;Trying to write them as empowering is the mistake to me.

I think it's tricky. Joss Whedon was celebrated in his early career for intentionally writing empowering women—they'd fight back against men who attacked them for being women or upstage men with their abilities at ""masculine"" activities. Now, though, those same character traits in newer works (both by Whedon and not) often feel patronizing or forced. This is because, before the past couple decades, competent and impressive female characters were rare enough in media that just going through effort to include them was exciting and novel.

Today, I believe it's more important to make female characters empower*ed*, not empower*ing*. If a female character has agency in her own story and isn't a token character **or** an absurd caricature of being ""empowering"", audiences are much more likely to naturally connect with the character and see her as a ""good female character""."
195,"&gt; She is going to be seen as less of a woman and therefore intimidating (a ""good"" trait) but this will scare away men and make her unmarriable - a woman's ultimate purpose and goal. So she needs to ""lower"" herself to be a woman and desirable to men.

I think this is the one I've personally experienced the most, even though the other two get talked about more. As a kid, I can remember family members actively refusing to teach me certain things - like how to maintain my car - because if I learned to do that stuff men wouldn't want me because I... wouldn't be able to make them feel useful?

It was fine for me to like cars and drive well, but not to know how to change my oil or fix a flat. It was okay to learn to use a hammer to hang a picture frame, but not how to build something. It was okay to learn to fish, but not how to clean anything I caught.

I actually really need to learn how to clean a fish, because my boyfriend and I both *like* fishing but neither of us knows how to clean a fish or how to handle it if a catch-and-release swallows the hook, so we never go fishing."

Maybe the sister has gained more authority in the house while big sis has been away. Maybe she's the one making all the decisions for the kids and big sis has no influence at all when she gets back. Maybe little sis resents big sis for being pushy about being different. Maybe she now has more sway in their village, who all also resent big sis for going away and breaking traditions. That feels MUCH more interesting to me. Where does the power really lie in this place? In being trained for military strength, or by wielding soft power in a traditional scenario?"

Have that extra slice of cheese cake and not feel like anyone is going to say anything. It's liberating, and after, you walk around and you feel about two inches taller because hey, you went away, alone, for a weekend.

204,"Other great uses for bobby pins:

* Keeping rolled up curtains staying rolled up
* Book mark
* Bending to support your phone to stand when watching something and don't feel like holding it
* Keeping the lid on those small green houses to your window open
* Keeping your real windows open
* Sealing plastic bags with food in your pantry
* Money clip
* Cleaning out or reaching into small spaces (I'm looking at you, old wooden floor)
* Keeping cables neatly together
* Keeping track when you're counting papers
* Support for drying brushes
* Cat toys (as /u/ummmmmmnope/ reported)

* Instead of paper clips
* Tool to wiggle the tray loose when your Xbox 360 refuses to open ಠ_ಠ
* Great utensil for organizing small things, highly recommended for any crafty person out there

She said absolutely not. So i went ahead and webt to the teen health center at my HS and got a prescription without her permission. 


2 weeks later she told me she had asked her co-workers and they said if your daughter asks for birth control, you should say ok regardless of the reasons she gives.

The atmosphere was quiet and calm. Everyone was super chill, unpretentious, and there were rarely any tourists (a huge problem at certain times of year).

Ok, so my SO was pretty badly emotionally abused by his dad and stepmom. They basically called him a slur anytime he exhibited any form of human emotion. God forbid he ever be sad, or in love, or be anything more than a jokester or robot.

Ive been friends with my SO long before we were dating. He would talk to me about how emotionally numb and distant from people hes made himself. He didnt even care about himself, really. He would always try and put out this image that he didnt care about anything and that he was a monster.

It was all total bull and Ive always known it.

No, Im not ""trying to see the best in him"". No, Im not ""trying to save his poor lost soul"". I just know him.

When his first love- his girlfriend of 3 years, suddenly broke up with him via ghosting because her family didnt approve of her dating a non-muslim, I was there. I watched him get eaten up from the inside over it for years. I knew about the nights he cried. I knew about the guilt he felt, that he was bothered that his exes father would make her feel terrible just because she was dating *him*. He felt he brought struggle upon her. He told me all about it.

I knew about the frustration he felt when his stepmom discouraged his dad from getting his heart checked out at the hospital.

He told me how confused hed feel when his dad was an asshole to him because he loved him and wished his opinion didnt matter to him. 

I saw the concern in his eyes when I threw up because I smoked too much hookah while I was dehydrated.

I saw the love in his eyes when he asked me if I was ok.

Yesterday he made me laugh so hard that I was almost crying. I saw joy in his face as he suddenly burst into laughter with me, just because he thought my laugh was funny.

That guy loves. That guy feels. And if he ever thinks otherwise he is either full of shit, or one hell of a liar.

Its harmless because he can ""keep it from me"" all he wants. His actions speak for him. and honestly, even though he wont talk about it, I think he knows that too. 

Thats ok. He doesnt have to talk about it.

Even if the intent is for the sake of comedy, the result is that the entertainment industry *does* set a very low standard for men.  

Generally speaking, I think that what we see on television has less of an impact than what we see around us in real life, but for people who don't have good real life role models, television and movies can reinforce the bad ones.

252,"I am a son of a Mother who adopted me when I was eight years old. I can give you my perspective if you want. If that breaks sub rules I understand and delete away etc.

Warning this my be long and I may add things to this. I am not great with stream of consciousness typing.

This was primarily 1980's. My mom had a long struggle in the adoption process. She had the financial capability and luckily she had her parents that where very supportive. She first tried in the US but could not and then in Latin America and though according to her there was one boy from Guatemala that came close it also fell through. Finally she was able to Adopt me from Eastern Europe in 1990. But as I said it did take her over 8+ years of paperwork and failed attempts. To say it was hard would be an understatement.

*This is an Addition*

People on here have said its hard or impossible to do as a single parent. I can say that one thing that she had going for her beside at the time the financial capability is that she had VERY strong ties to the catholic church. I'm not saying she was a churchgoer(she was) I am saying she knew the higher ups like the head of an order of nuns that consisted of over 100,000 nuns. She knew bishops etc. 

You have to understand that OUTSIDE of the US one of the largest orginizations that deal with Orphanages is the Catholic Church. They have thousands of orphanages across the globe. I am sure that helped her in a lot of ways in breaking some doors down. 



*End of Addition*

I could go into what it was like specifically raising me and my circumstances however I don't think that is what you are looking for. I will try to cover some of the big things that occurred that related to her being single and female.

1. She was financially capable of supporting me when she adopted me. However as luck would have it she got in a car wreck 9 months after the adoption. This was a life altering event. She was not able to work. So things got a little be harder. She did not have a ""second"" source of income in the household.

2. The accident also limited her ability to do ""boy"" activities. I remember we would go to the public tennis court and she would try to teach me how to play tennis. This stopped immediately  after the wreck. She could also not carry me on her back. All these things laid an emotional toll on her. I remember even when I was ten I would here her crying on the phone with her mother saying ""this is not fair"" I want to be able to X, Y, and Z with my son and I can't. I want him to be able to experience this things and I cant do it with him.

3. She always attempted to set the right example. From the age of 8 till I left for college she did not once that I remember drink alcohol. She never had boyfriends and she never had ""girls night out"". I think she ""over"" sacrificed her own life but I can't speak for her. I do think this was also part of her personality of being the ""good kid"" in her family dynamic. The one that was responsible and did her homework, that took care of her parents, the one that ""passed"" on the genes by having children.

4. Finally and the one that is most ""gendered"" and that sticks out is her hunt for a ""Father Figure"". Throught my childhood she would always have my male teachers call me at home and check up on me. I did not notice this at first but by the time I got to Jr High it became patently obvious what she was doing. She felt that as a boy I needed a father figure of sorts and would always attempt to have either a school teacher, a camp counselor, or hell even a priest at one point, try to fill the role. It got so bad I would intentionally make sure not to mention male authority figures that i came across during my day when she asked how was my day.

All that being said. I consider my mother to be the greatest mother in the world. She has always been there for me and at no point in my life did I feel I was screwed because I never had a father. I can't say that I did not miss out on somethings. I did. I can't say that I never sometimes wished I could talk about sex or ""boy"" stuff with someone that could understand on the same level as me. But I can say I would not trade my mom for the whole world.

 She went through a lot and had to struggle with my baggage as an 8 year old bouncing around in foster care. But she did it. And the look on her face when I graduated college is still a thing that is seared into my brain. Joy, relief ( I may have taken the Tommy Boy route of ""A lot of people go to college for eight years"" :P , happiness, pride, sadness, and above all love. To her it was all worth it.

I knew that if I could tie my shoes that I could conquer the world.  Since then I've sailed the ocesns, climbed mountains, rafted the Grand Canyon and seen things most people only dream of.  But it took loosing everything then gaining it back.  And to this day when everything seems out of control, I think to myself, that I once tied my shoes when it was impossible, and therefore anything is possible."

275,"Horrid Henry. The problem isn't the show, it's more that small kids copy what they see and hear. I let my 3 year old watch it last Christmas when I was sick. One morning was all it took when the channel was running four episodes back to back and I was too out of it to pay much attention (it was a preschool channel, right, how bad could it be?!). 

For the next six months we got ""Silence worm!"" whenever we said something he didn't like, such as ""no more sweets"" or ""time for bed"". 

And the ""na na na na na"" taunt is the theme tune. 

These things are funny or ironic on a TV show or uttered by adults but they are *incredibly* bratty and obnoxious coming out of a three year old's mouth. "

Yes mannerisms, attitude, etc. Basically, personality! Which is not a factor in the gay terms I've heard.

292,"See, I keep hearing that, but I think Bratz are pretty cool. Not the live action movie (Jesus Christ that one was horrible) but the cartoons.

They're great friends and they stick up to bullies!"" Of course, I also don't think there's anything *wrong* with people wearing short skirts and lots of makeup, so maybe that affects my opinions on it.  
  
  It's the same thing with Barbie. I watched a ton of Barbie movies as a kid, and what I took away from it was ""Being nice is good, standing up for yourself and your friends is good, and fairies and dragons are *awesome*."" But I hear a bunch of other people criticizing it and saying it just teaches girls that being pretty is the only thing that matters. It makes me wonder if we were watching the same shows/movies."
293,"i'd say the biggest mistake is talking too much, but there are a variety of ways this happens: 

- not recognizing small talk -- small talk is meant to be superficial. that doesn't mean that you need to give one-word answers, but it does mean that if someone asks a question that you happen to know a lot about...this might not be the time to reveal the extreme depth of your knowledge. i'm not talking about super basic small talk, like ""how's the weather"" type stuff, but party talk, where conversations are usually fairly superficial so they can flow in and out. when you start to go TOO in-depth into one topic, you mess up the flow of the conversation, and you also end up talking a lot (especially if you're trying to explain something). going off on a tangent is *fine*, but you shouldn't be writing a book.
- not listening to others -- and i don't just mean talking all the time and not giving others enough time to speak. i mean not actually *listening* to what others are saying. if you're thinking about what you're going to say next, instead of listening to what the person in front of you is saying, they're going to know.
- talking about politics, religion, and other non-light-hearted topics in casual situations -- it's fine to touch on current events -- like, ""did you see the debate last night"" -- but it's not cool to start trying to convert someone in the middle of a party. it's just not. you don't look like someone who's worldly and knowledgeable and smart, you look like someone who does not know how to act at a party. 
- interrupting people -- it's fine to jump in with a relevant, snarky remark once in a while. but oh dear god, do people hate being interrupted. 
- playing devil's advocate all the damn time -- arguing for the sake of arguing gets old very quickly, unless you know someone fairly well. and doing it in front of a group means you're *usually* monopolizing the conversation -- nobody else can talk, because every time they say something you jump in with a ""but what if...""
- being super negative and/or self-deprecating -- self-deprecating humor is *rarely* something people do well. the main reason being that it's not supposed to be *actually* negative. honestly, there's not a lot of room in casual conversation for ultra-negativeness -- people do not want to spend their precious time trying to convince you that you're not a horrible person. because honestly, they probably don't know that you aren't, and they just don't care. 
- insisting that someone else *get* what you're saying -- it's one thing to say ""no, you don't get it, i *really* mean _____,"" once. ONCE. SAY IT ONCE. then move on. yes, maybe the person you're talking to doesn't really get what you're saying, but it's not worth it to try to drive your point into the ground. well, that is, unless the thing they don't get is the fact that you want them to leave you alone, of course.

As for babies, don't really have anything that sucks that bad. My husband is an unreal father and I have a support system like no other so whenever anyone needs a break, there is someone I trust to pick up the parenting until we can get some rest.

307,"&gt; a lot of his wins, especially early on, were handed to him by others.

I think that this is actually one of the things that makes Harry a more compelling character.

He destroyed Voldemort the first time, but it was due to his mother's sacrifice. He's rich, but it was all given to him by his parents. He ""defeats"" multiple huge challenges, but he was either in the right place at the right time or had a more gifted ally help him out. So, over time, this legend gets created by other people, and any attempts by him to say, ""No, you've got it all wrong-"" get dismissed as him being modest and polite. His modest actual talent is vastly overshadowed by the expectations that people have of him.

Then the challenges start getting worse. His lack of talent and immaturity start to have truly real consequences. People sacrifice themselves because they think he has a plan, and all he can do is sit there going ""They believed in me for nothing."" When he starts getting overwhelmed and complains about it, he gets dismissed by everyone else. He has to figure shit out and make it happen, and he eventually does. That's a good story.

**Status**: Everything is hopeless, I am in despair, all is lost.

**Comment**: Oh no!  What's wrong!

**Reply**: My parents aren't letting me use their HBO GO account anymore.

Then I'm going to assume they either didn't read my profile, or just think I'm hot and don't care. I (like most women) get way too many messages to bother replying to everyone who says generic shit.

So, we go on this date and it seemed to go quite well. He was very nice, been travelling lived abroad for a few years, well educated etc etc. Easy going laid back, nice smile. Date finished go home done. 

We continued chatting over messages ect and decided to go for a brunch date.

First off, he didn't order any food even though we'd met to go for food at a cafe.

He then started to tell me that:

* He Does not believe in evolution
* However; Psychopaths actually carry the ""warrior gene"" which has been passed down form generation to generation.
* Natural selection isn't a thing. 
* Yes those 2 above points do conflict with each other
* Science is a religion
* Gonna put the mentioning that ALL MEN ARE RAPISTS comment again because it was the strangest thing that anyone could say on a date - or ever at all in any time or place.

It's not something I focus on, but I am *aware* in the back of my mind that nearly every man I encounter has the ability to physically overpower me if they chose. I am trusting that they won't. So while I don't live in fear and certainly don't think or assume that every man is dangerous, when it comes to things like someone new asking me to come back to his place for example, the risk/benefit I assess is likely more serious/weighted than many men would do in the same situation."

He never listens to anyone else, he puts blinders on whenever he decides his path of action is the right way, he's secretive and judgemental and righteous and a terrible communicator. *He* decides it's time for Boone to let go of Shannon so *he* kidnaps him and drugs him and forces him to go through something because he's decided that's what Boone needs, regardless of Boone not asking for that.  
  
I mean he has good qualities too and he's pretty well written, and there are other characters in media that I *dislike* more, but Locke is incredibly *frustrating* for me as a character."
343,"One of my teachers in high school had a theory that watching Spongebob legitimately lowered a person's intelligence (or potential intelligence; I can't remember which). He hadn't done any formal studies beyond polling his students every semester, and correlation does not equal causation, but his findings were...interesting."
344,Not being able to buy TV channels a la carte!
345,"Attorneys. Most attorneys are jerks. I worked in the courts for 2 years so I got to see my fair share of them from how they put on a show in court to how they treat clients behind closed doors and then when the client isn't in the room. Hell no. 

Law enforcement. You're either a good cop and I'm going to worry about you getting killed everyday, or you're a bad cop and were drawn to the job because you like to have authority over others. Nope and nope.

347,"Mayor Goodway in *Paw Patrol*. 

I have a toddler."
348,"Honestly that it has such a clear ""moral"" that would probably be glaringly obvious to the readers before it becomes obvious to the characters themselves makes it sound a bit after-school special-y.

But, it's all in the execution, so if you want to write it, you should just go for it anyway before you go about trying to get input from other people."
349,Brussel sprouts. They take a ton of flak but they're just cute tiny cabbages doing their best. And they're absolutely delicious.
350,It's scary how they can act until they don't get what they want.
351,"I have felt the same way all my life, and I have also taken the approach of dressing boldly, always being clean and well-groomed to the extent I can, and walking with confidence.  I try to come from a place of self-love and not defiance, and that is sometimes a daily struggle."
352,"&gt; And I can only speak for myself but if a guy opens with something about my looks I don't respond at all.

i don't mind it, but the compliments have to be a) mild and b) in the context of a wider display of interest. example:

''hi! we seem to have similar taste in movies, and i have to say you look pretty cute! what's your favorite quote from Amadeus?''

pretty/cute are fine, but beautiful/sexy cross the line into ''this person is putting way too investment in a few photos''"
353,"I wouldn't have a problem with it if they had fat women with hot boyfriends but this imbalance points to how women HAVE TO BE attractive in order to even be on TV, and it's annoying to say the least."
354,I really can't believe this myth that any woman can get laid at any time still hasn't died. 
355,He has the biggest juiciest butt I've ever seen on a man. That thing is fabulously plump. It shakes like jello if you touch it. And I touch the fuck out of it. I'm pretty obsessed with that ass. Mine is completely unremarkable. 
356,"Not to be disrespectful to either of you, but I think what he was trying to say was that if the guy had punched you (used his upper body strength more efficiently) it would have probably left you incapacitated and unable to fight back. 
"
357,"I tried a couple of his books and I couldn't stand how hard John Green tried to sound quirky and deep, but came across as incredibly boring and cliche. Plus it doesn't help that I find the man himself annoying as hell."
358,"Invader Zim

Nickelodeon asks a dude whose claim to fame is R Rated comics Johnny The Homicidal Maniac &amp; Filler Bunny (Yes a cute bunny gets tortured to be even cuter) to make a show for kids.

Show gets cancelled after 1.5 seasons because its too dark.

And yes it's one of my all time favorite cartoons!"
359,"Being a nursing student, I quickly learned that letting cuts/scrapes/wounds ""air out"" (i.e. not properly dressing them) like my mum always taught me is why I always had scars that took ages to heal! (She still refused to believe this though.) Use band aids, kids."
360,"What's horrid about it?

Most people I know who've tried it have become passionate converts (to the point where they annoy others by trying to ""show them the light""). But everyone prefers different stuff. I love them because you can leave them in for much longer, don't have to worry about TSS, don't have to buy tampons, don't have a string hanging out. But some people have problems with leaking or find it hard to clean in a public bathroom. Just like some people prefer pads to tampons. 

It's just a period dude, it's not horrid. I assure you if men had periods they'd somehow spin it into something that made them superior to women, and would have competitions about who could bleed the most."
361,"I was expecting a mean-looking comb or something, but seeing that little fucker honestly scared me. "
362,It's one of many problems in the representation of women and relationships. 
363,Are you Katherine Heigl's character in 27 Dresses?
364,It's okay. Have an upvote. Apparently I'm not allowed to not like Harry Potter. 
365,You're actually really pretty. I would definitely hit on you. 
366,"Dear Body Support Staff,

I am experiencing an issue in which my body seems to think eating a box of Nerds is an acceptable replacement for dinner. Do you have any idea what is causing this bug or how I can fix it?

Thank you for your time,

/u/fishielicious"
367,"Oh my god, are people still going to be saying this to me at 37? I'm 29 and it already bugs the hell out of me. No, I don't want a kid, yes, I'm sure, no, I don't want the 'joy of holding my own child', please god leave me alone. "
368,"I'm not a woman, but I'm half black and half white and one of my co-workers once said she thought I was half Puerto Rican, 3/8ths Jewish, and 1/8th Italian. Like... what? Where did you even get those numbers from?

People are weird as heck about race."
369,"I have 6"" ones that break minds when I wear them. Last time I wore them (for an event at work), I had people tell me tall girls shouldn't walk nice in heels. Also, ""aren't you tall enough?"" and ""hey stand up and show [person] how tall you are today""."
370,"I just feel it would be inappropriate because I am there to take care of them and be a stable adult for them. On those days I surely told them I was sad that my dog died and sad that my relationship ended but I didn't feel it was appropriate for me to break down into tears infrint of the children. I also don't know how their parents would feel about their nanny crying on the job. It could come off as being emotionally unstable. But I agree children are great at comfort I have cried in front of my friends son before and as a 4 year old he tells me he loves me and said ""your crying because your boyfriend was mean and being a bad boy"""
371,"I'm trans. Visibly trans. While I like to think I have some very nice features (and a bangin body, in my own personal opinion) I've been told I'm an ugly, feminine dude and an ugly masculine chick. 

amiugly thread for proof 

*edited comment to remove link to abide by sub rules.

But I just try to get better. Try to get constructive critcism so I can make myself look decent and feel good about myself. Hope that time and hormones can make me look okay. Make me look like myself. 

But it gets fucking lonely sometimes. I really want to date people but it's really hard to find someone willing to put up with my physical appearance and genitals. But I try to live life the best I can and find other ways to make myself happy.

Edit 2: Huh, just got temp banned from r/amiugly for feeding trolls. I mean, I wasnt planning on posting in there again for a very long time, if ever, anyway. But huh."
372,"Piper's whole ""I'm tough"" routine where she bragged about how big a deal she was to legitimately tougher people was so cringe-inducing. Her entire playbook is framing people and getting them sent to max-absolutely no way that can backfire! I actually feel like the branding wasn't enough justice, it was  a few days worth of pain for YEARS of Ruiz's life. Over motherfucking panties! "
373,Zero. We eloped. 
374,"I feel the same way about Marnie too. Both of them are so frustrating to watch, there's so much second-hand embarrassment, so many terrible stupid decisions, so much what-the-fuck-are-you-doing-STOP-IT moments...but then they have these tiny moments of genuine vulnerability or profundity or personal growth that stop me in my tracks and kind of wreck me emotionally....and then the next ep they're back doing dumb terrible shit. "
