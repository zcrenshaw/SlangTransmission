0,Never ever does anyone finger anyone else with those long stiletto dagger nails.
1,"This one time I got a free donut and I trusted him to take it home for me and he *ate it.* 

That took a long time to get over, but it's in the past now."
2,That time he grew out a goatee and dyed it fucking *fuschia*.
3,"A lot of men see crying during an argument as ""manipulating them with tears"", rather than a physical reaction to stress and frustration.

Along the same vein, some will perceive not wanting to have sex after an argument as ""withholding sex"" rather than the fact that going through the stress and pain of an argument isn't particularly conductive to feeling turned on."
4,"We were in Dubai on holiday. I love the cheescake factory so lost my shit when I saw it there ( We're irish so dont get a regular fix of it ) Red velvet is my weakness. As always, you're way too full when it comes to dessert. So I got mine to go. Back to the fab hotel, I fall asleep cause fuck it, it's holidays, relax, he's up watching tv. I wake up later and go to get my Cheesecake. 

The fucker ATE IT ALL WHILE I WAS ASLEEP

It was almost a dealbreaker. "
5,"I just want to say that it's not always the soft, gentle, sensual thing that some people are describing. I *have* had partners where sex was mostly like that. *But* I've also had female partners who were not into gentle and sensual at all---our sex focuses on primal fucking. Rough kissing and moving against each other. Grabbing and biting. Hard thrusting into various holes with toys, fingers, hands, or strap-on cocks. 

Lesbian sex can be quickies against to counter or hours long orgasm fests in bed. Soft or hard. It can be mouths, hands, toys, cocks (strap-ons can be basically used exactly like a cock). 

The one big difference between lesbian sex and porn? Real sex isn't performative. It isn't meant to look good for the cameras. The people involved are intently focused on each other. (And yeah, not so much with the dagger-like fingernails! wth?)"
6,"Eating weird/unbalanced meals. Like, *actually mom*, it turns out I *can* have just pickles for lunch, no one cares and nothing bad happens to me."
7,That your bra strap showing is not the end of the world 
8,"Not as much in the last couple of years, but definitely the amount of harassment women get. 

I remember a couple of years ago my uni did a whole push for Zero Tolerance of Sexual Harassment or something, including putting out flyers with examples of inappropriate interaction. This was on sports night, so we were all sat round drinking. One guy picked it up, laughed, and handed it to me, going, ""How much of this has ACTUALLY happened to you?"".

I read the list and ticked off every single point. He thought I was kidding. Handed it to the girl next to me and she confirmed she'd had everything, too (we're talking everything from cat calls to being cornered, followed to being groped etc. The only thing missing was actual serious sexual assault stuff).

All of the guys looked genuinely horrified. They'd had no idea it was affecting women on a day to day basis that they saw and treated perfectly fine."
9,"He would criticize what I would make for dinner. Sometimes I would have a main dish and he would question the lack of sides or say that what I made wasn't a real dinner. We had a come to Jesus talk where I told him unless he is the one grocery shopping or actually cooking the dinner, he doesn't have the right to be negative or make comments. We both realized that growing up, our idea of dinner was different. I now make a weekly/monthly meal plan where I ask for his input and he will help cook when he has the chance. Can't remember the last time he made a negative comment."
10,"I don't now but I did about 18 years ago. I was working three part-time jobs - at a sandwich shop during lunch M-F, a call center in the evening/night M-F, and a motofoto on the weekends. Luckily I had a vehicle that was paid for. I was living in an apartment. I paid rent and sometimes utilities (my gas got cut off once or twice). The lady that ran the sandwich shop let me take home bread every night (because she made fresh bread daily) so that helped a lot. I remember not having enough money for toiletries so I used to buy a big bottle of body wash from the dollar store and use it for my hair too because I couldn't really afford both - much less conditioner. My best friend's mom would invite me over for dinner sometimes and let me take home leftovers. So did my sister. My parents, who lived out of town, would take me to the grocery store whenever they were in town. I couldn't afford my meds, so my health deteriorated a lot during that time (I couldn't afford my prescription inhaler so I would buy primatene mist when I could afford it and then use it sparingly so it wouldn't run out). One of the jobs I walked to, so I could save money on gas. The other two were too far for walking so I had to drive but I would always consolidate any driving trips to save gas. I pawned a bunch of things. It finally started to get better when a friend of mine got me hired at the call center where she worked - full time, decent pay, and benefits. A few years later I decided to go back to school (was able to do Pell grants for several years). My life has turned around significantly since then. I don't know what kept me going back then - maybe just the belief that at some point it would get better or I'd get an opportunity somewhere. And it turned out I was right."
11,"I work in professional sports (media). Men often think it's the athletes who sexually harass women or make sexists comments on a daily basis. It's not. It's the dad-types and older men. 

There aren't many females in my world, but I've worked really hard and earned my way here. Men have no shame in asking me ""who did you sleep with to get this job?"" They often seem shocked when they ""learn"" I actually know sports and spent 15+ years pushing my way to this level.

Last year I walked into the pressbox to work a big college football game. A man said to me in front of everyone: ""come sit up front, so we all have something good to look at this game."" 🙄 They have no shame. It's truly a good 'ole boys club. 

They always care more about the color of my toenail polish or hairstyle than stories I report. If I beat them to a source, it's only because ""somebody just wants to date you."" I have no problem snapping back and holding my own. It's just sad that I have to do it on a daily basis (I work in many different sports). At the same time, I want to make sure it's known that young athletes were raised correctly; unfortunately, their bosses were not. "
12,"Brush your teeth. Seriously.  The second set have a limited warranty and you really don't want to have to get expensive dental work when you're 40. (Edit - Also, floss. You only floss the teeth you want to keep. Thanks /u/yogurtmeh)

Wear sunscreen. Even when it is cloudy. Skin cancer is no joke.  Make sure you get the backs of your hands and the tops of your feet.

He is not worth ruining your life for.  Either is she.  The only one who puts you first is you unless you get really, really stupidly lucky.  

Call your parents. "
13,"Only that my husband is very unhappy and stressed at work and I hate seeing him so deflated and upset. I know that I can cheer him up short-term by cooking him his favourite food, cuddling him and listening to him talk, but the fact that I can't do more makes me sad. "
14,"So my husband and I recently went to Best Buy.  We tracked down an employee and **I** was asking him some questions about some computers because I am in the hunt for a new laptop.  And the guy responded to my questions....but directed his speech and attention to my husband (who had not said a word).

I honestly don't think the guy at best buy realized what he was doing because this subtle sexism happens so often that my husband doesn't register it half the time (he made a comment to me about this particular exchange when we left the store).

TL;DR - It is ruuuuude to pay more attention to a woman's male partner when she was the one talking in the first place."
15,The severity of menstrual pain and how much of a literal and figurative pain in the ass menstruation is.
16,"Not knowing what you're doing. It's so reassuring to enter a ""real"" workplace and be surrounded by people 20 years older than me who have the same questions or insecurities I have, or who don't know how to do things I know, or who treat my own ""what the fuck am I doing"" questions like no big deal and are happy to help. I was so embarrassed but I've slowly come to realize that this is just how adulthood works and it's better to ask people for help than to feign competence only to get tripped up later."
17,"I really like crow's feet, it makes a person look so lovely and you can see they genuinely smiled a lot."
18,This one is just odd.    Who gives a a fuck what shape the bottle of shampoo or conditioner is?  
19,"Having kids has been a sensitive subject for me... I'm on the fence. I was having a lot of anxiety about my 30th birthday for some reason... and the morning of my birthday he brought up kids in a ""clock's ticking"" sort of way. We were traveling all day and he wouldn't get off the subject, I was trapped in the car for hours. I asked him to drop it, not talk about it on my birthday. He wouldn't stop. I spent the night of my 30th birthday crying alone on the floor in my bathroom. 

I'm still working on forgiving him."
20,"Loud men with big noses. I also love pale, clean-shaven scrawny dudes. If you look like you haven't slept in a week and can't grow a beard, I'm probably into you."
21,Bi lady here. No scissoring. It really depends on the participants. I dated a girl for a few months who was obsessed with her strap on. Usually though it's fingering and oral with the occasional toy thrown in. The real difference though is in the energy. I found it tends to be very tender and with more foreplay.
22,"My mother always told me to get a new haircut and rearrange my bedroom. Not only did it distract me, but the change of scenery makes you feel like a new person. I highly recommend it. Especially rearranging."
23,Once i cried because when i was watching deadliest catch i kept thinking about all the crabs and their families being separated. 
24,"Emotional labor.  Women are generally the ones tasked with organizing office parties, sending cards around to be signed, etc.  In hetero relationships, women are often in charge of keeping in touch with family on both sides (my husband's mother always coordinates plans with  me!).  For couples I know with kids, the mom is the one who identifies when the kid's clothes/shoes are too small, buys new ones, puts away the clothes that don't fit, etc."
25,"To trick myself into thinking I'm attractive. 

I made myself sad.  "
26,I care about the shape in the sense that I want something that's not going to slip out of my hands and smash my feet.
27,"I now find it unbelievable how my mom was able to prepare a completely balanced meal for four people every night. A meat dish, a vegetable dish, a starch dish... I can cook *one* of those things and it takes an hour and creates another hour of cleanup time. 

So yeah, I will gladly eat nothing but a frozen cheese pizza for dinner once in a while, thanks."
28,"I had no idea how much self assurance would come with age. I feel so much more accepting of myself and others, and I tend to really enjoy giving other people happiness now. 

Selfishness was replaced with enjoyment from other's happiness, empathy. Mind you this is just my take. I have female acquaintances who are envious, jealous, petty, and super gamey. They tend to be very self conscious and have aged horribly, emotionally especially. You can see the disdain in their eyes when they see younger women or women who have things they want. They are very passive aggressive, shallow, and materialistic. It became more pronounced as they aged. But you tend to end up with like minded people as you age, which is really wonderful. A solid core of strong women with loving hearts who are open to adventure. 

I'd never go back to my 20's again. Or my teens. My body was youthful, but I was in better shape in my early 30s than I ever was before. I only really miss my skin being younger looking, but meh, my scars and wrinkles tell a story. 

I think I didn't know this would happen because my mother aged quite badly, as she had been a beauty queen who never was expected to mature mentally. She is very codependant and eventually my father left her for a younger woman. She became quite embittered. My older female siblings followed suit. I was a tomboy and kind of awkward, so I had to find other strength. Since beauty and sexuality weren't my tools in the world, aging came quite easy to me. "

30,How long have you and Guy Fieri been together?
31,Pre-marital sex.
32,"Male here.  I honestly don't know how I stumbled across this subreddit.  I've been browsing Reddit out of boredom and here I am.  Anyway, I feel very compelled to reply to your comment to let you know that you're making a much bigger positive impact than you think.  Your husband would have gone absolutely insane and hopeless if it weren't for you.  

I'm sure he sees hope when he looks at you and I'm very sure when he's working, he looks forward to seeing you everyday.  Your husband is very lucky to have you.  In my opinion, nothing is better than having a life partner who you could always count on and who will always support you.

**Edit:** I didn't expect my comment to get so much positive attention!  If you're reading this and you're currently helping your partner through hard times, the same applies to you.  Your help makes a much bigger, positive impact than you think.  You're his/her rock, his/her beacon of hope.  Without you, they'd surely go insane.  And if you and your partner are currently going through hard times, I hope you guys get through it and experience good times soon."
33,"I asked him to water my garden when I was away and he forgot. It was wicked hot that week and I lost a few plants. :( He bought a bottle of wine and had it waiting for me when I got home though, to soften the blow. "
34,Big/distinctive noses. 
35,"The opposite of the 'strong, silent type': warm, expressive and unafraid to be vulnerable. "
36,"&gt; If you look like you haven't slept in a week and can't grow a beard, I'm probably into you.

How's your inbox doing?"
37,"I did all the things I'd been wanting to do for ages but my ex wasn't interested in - I took dance classes, joined a choir, went to Vegas, Paris and Berlin, took piano lessons, bought a house, got pets and so on. I realised he'd really been holding me back and that I was better off without him. "
38,Looking at that makes me wince every time. 
39,"That you continue to grow and be challenged in all these areas. Everyone talked about ""when you grow up..."" as if it were a place, an age, a mind state. What they didn't ever talk about was the continual challenges personally, emotionally, spiritually, etc. The challenges that continue to happen and how its is relevant to our life as a whole. 
They didn't mention how we have to challenge our bodies for continual growth either. 

In sum, lifelong growth was never mentioned. "
40,"Our schedules are opposite. I work evenings, he works in the day. I work all day on the weekends, he has them free. Its hard to spend a lot of quality time together. It gives me anxiety when im around him because i feel like *i have to make it meaningful.*

It sucks."
41,"*I* don't feel all that different.  The physical stuff has mostly came on slowly so while I'll occasionally think about how easy it all used to be it doesn't surprise me or impact my daily life. I'm more centered, less subject to pressure, more calm and have ever so much less interest in engaging with shitty people. I'm the better version of the me I've always been.  I'm hopeful about that being a continuing trend until my mental faculties start to fail.

What has surprised me, even though I did hear about, it is how invisible I am in society.  It isn't just that I'm no longer attractive - I don't exist.  It's like having a big ""not my problem/not my interest"" shield rather than a cloak of invisibility. The waves of humanity part around me but interact with me in no other way. "
42,"He freezes me out when he's upset. Shoves me away from him and sleeps on a friend's/his mom's couch for a couple of nights. This time, I have no fucking idea what even happened and he's ignoring his phone. 

 It's stressing me out and I can't stop wracking my brain for what I did wrong. Sources say he does this sometimes, regardless of whether it has reason. 

Last time he did this, he took something I said out of context and didn't speak to me for like a week. Came back, apologized, cried, took a road trip. Four days later, it happened again. 

Mental illness in a partner is not for the faint of heart. 


**Edit:** Holy fuck I am never drinking again. No gratuitous details, but witnessing that must have been terrifying. We are both seeking help from professionals, separately."
43,"I suppose that some women find hairy men to be unattractive but I like big, burly men with lots of chest hair.  "
44,"Shy or submissive men, especially if they are androgynous.

I don't know if that counts, but it seems a lot of women aren't attracted to those qualities. I remember getting teased relentlessly from both men and women in high school for liking the awkward, ""girly"" guys.

My current boyfriend is super pretty. He has long, thick hair, can only grow a little facial hair on his chin, and has no chest hair at all. He has a very slender build with a cute, girly butt. He's very mild-mannered and shy in public. He's also intuitive and picks up nonverbal communication better than any other man I've been with. He's gentle and submissive. We've been together for a year and a half, but I can't stop swooning over him."
45,"What type of donut was it? 

Sorry if this question is too painful. "
46,"Nudity. When I was a kid I judged the shit out of nude sunbathers. Fifteen years later, Hippie Hollow is my favorite place."
47,"Tampon commercials having to be peppy young women in pink playing tennis or going to the beach.

All women know what a period is like and tampons are being marketed directly to us, so the beating-around-the-bush ad style is weird."
48,[deleted]
49,"Shaking hands.  At my work especially.  Men will completely bypass me to shake the hands of the men there, even though I'm the manager and the person who they think is in charge is a part-timer with no authority.


It's 100% because I'm a young woman and the part timers are men in their 40-50s. 


Which cool, please introduce yourself, but do it to me too.  Don't ignore me completely.  Rude af.  


Although my staff loves telling them I'm in charge just as much as I do.   At least most have the grace to look embarassed. "
50,"Me and my boyfriend got one of those little cheesecake plate things at Walmart. We ate all but one slice - he was too full, and I'm counting calories, so I couldn't eat any more without going over. He said I could have that piece.

The next day, I planned my whole day of eating around that slice of cheesecake. I had light meals all day. I got home after work, ate my light dinner, and then opened the fridge - and it was gone. He had eaten it WHILE I WAS AT WORK.

When confronted, he said, ""You left it in there for days!""

""We bought it YESTERDAY."""
51,"If it helps, I asked my gynecologist about the whole turning 30 = slow decline of fertility. She was so...Assertive in her response. She apparently hates that idea, she said I might have a slight decline in fertility at 35, but that really until 40 there is not that steep dropoff. She basically told me to live my life and not worry about it. She had her kids in her late 30s and doesn't regret it. Shes a great doc. It made me feel better, and I hope it does for you too.

Sorry that your SO harassed you so much about it. It's okay to be on the fence, you've got time :)"
52,"I think a lot of guys (and girls) think I fake it when I have ditzy moments. Like everyone has this idea that girls act airheaded to be cutesy, and while some do I don't. I genuinely am extremely absent-minded and overwhelmed by small things at times."
53,"I hope it blows up in the governments face when it's used in court by non Christians.  And I say this as a Christian.  

There is no war on religion.  Just a lot of people who refuse to be governed by religion in a purposefully secular country. If the idiots on top want to protect ""religious rights"", they better be prepared to extend those ""rights"" to every religion, and atheism as well."
54,"I got more people screaming at me, than flirting. "
55,Watching TV during dinner 
56,"How terrible hormonal birth control is for me. I tried the pill (projectile vomiting), the mini pill (projectile vomiting), and the patch (terrible painful rash accompanied by projectile vomiting). I'm also at a higher risk for stokes and blood clots due to a genetic thing, so I really shouldn't take it. I still had boyfriends in the past get very annoyed when I wouldn't ""just try it again and see."" Married now and husband has a vasectomy so it's a moot point but seriously irksome at the time."
57,"I'm fine with it -- I'm sure it's embarrassing, but I don't think passenger safety should be compromised in order to spare an overweight person's feelings."
58,"One time my work-friend gave me one of his samosas at lunch &amp; I went to the bathroom and cried. 

It was just so nice of him??"
59,"I don't know if it's considered unattractive but guys that openly ""awwh"" at cute things without caring about other people's reactions, and treat animals like they're their babies 😍
It just shows me that they're generally good hearted people."
60,"When we first lived together, before our wedding, our bank accounts were separate. He made more money than me (so I thought) and so he said he would pay the rent and the bills and my paychecks would be for groceries and incidentals. Little did I know, he pretty much quit working and thus didn't make any money (it was a commission only job). Unbeknownst to me, about a year after we moved in, and about 6 months after our wedding, the rent didn't get paid for 3 months and I never knew anything was wrong until I received a panicked phone call at work saying the sheriff had just served us with an eviction notice and we had til the end of the day to move all of our worldly possessions out.

As a result of this, we had to move into his parents' tiny 2 bedroom apartment ""temporarily"" until we ""get back on our feet."" 

It's been almost 3 years. I got accidentally knocked up since we've been here so now with the expenses that come with having a child, I don't think we're ever getting out of here. 

I dont really see any point in still being angry with him. There's nothing any of us can do about it now. 

Edited because I left out a few details. "
61,"Reading.

I used to sit and read whole books and then some in entire days. I've been trying to set times to make myself read lately because I know it's something that the more I do it, the more I'll want to continue. But so far it hasn't taken hold yet. I'll keep at it though!"
62,Once I saw a girl do her eyeliner on the tube during rush hour...WHILE STANDING UP
63,"i found one of his reddit posts. he was talking about a time when he hung out with another woman and she unexpectedly kissed him. he said he pulled back and told her ""i have a girlfriend""...and then described that as ""stupid, i know."" he said it was stupid to disclose that he had a girlfriend, and that he regretted not going for more.

i forgave him eventually, but it almost caused the end of our relationship. "
64,"Stereotypically female interests/actions = lame. Also, a woman making jokes about men or making a criticism about men misandric when the guy himself does the same about women and reject that's misogyny. ex. Say Mad Men with misogynist characters is just a TV series and like the show, rap songs with misogynist lyrics are just fiction but Beyonce is misandric for her lyrics and we shouldn't like those songs, Sex and the City is awful and ""only materialistic, shallow women like that show."""
65,"It backfired massively, but the Bic 'For Her' ballpoint pens- still wrote in black, but came in a pink barrel. 
With Dove, I've never liked all this body positivity stuff in their advertising. Call me cynical, but I find they are too heavy-handed with it to the point where it is too obviously a patronising marketing ploy. This particular example is cringeworthy- 'They're one of a kind-just like you!' ugh. And that is without thinking of the potential waste issues mentioned by standstagger."
66,"Sometimes I take public trans to work in my gym clothes if it is really really hot out and then change once I am at work.  

I always wear sleeveless dresses on other days and carry around a work appropriate cardigan in my bag.

Also, get a bad ass Japanese style folding fan.  There are different ones on etsy to make it your own style.  People might stare....*in jealousy* as you are keeping yourself cool with an awesome fan.  Best part is that it folds up and you can toss it in your bag."
67,"Spoiler: we broke up, but also not spouse. My ex had had major hip surgery a few years back and has a titanium rod that needs to be removed. He told me broke it in a dirt bike accident when he fell and crushed his hip on a rock. Big story. Getting back to the road finding a hospital the whole nine yards. 

Then one night we were at a concert with his friend and the guy said ""so, did Jeremy tell you how he broke his hip?""  Jeremy got pretty upset at that and when I said ""yeah, motorcycle accident"" the friend cracked up. It was super awkward. 

Turns out that motorcycle accident happened to the friend, but he just busted his bike and no bones. My boyfriend and this friend were drunkenly wrestling in the front yard and there was a weird angle and POP Jeremy's hip broke. THATs how it got broken. Stupid angle while wrestling. Not long dramatic motorcycle adventure. 

I forgave him for that lie because it didn't seem like a big deal and he told me early on in the relationship and he was embarrassed with how it really happened and just waned to impress me. Stupid guy shit. No biggie. I was pissed, but got over it and moved on. 

2 years later we broke up and I found out a bunch more lies. Turns out if somebody is comfortable lying just to cover up some minor embarrassment they are comfortable lying about pretty much everything. "
68,"He's not helping around the house. To the point of not even throwing his trash away. Will literally bring it into the kitchen and leave it on the counter ABOVE where the trash can lives. WHAT!?!?!? He's also started some spring cleaning and stopped in the middle. Our room is covered in clothes he doesn't wear most of the time but won't find a place for them. 

I get it, you work, you're tired. Well I work too, and I don't want to be the only one keeping the house tidy! I already do all that and take care of he dog. The other day, I didn't tell him to change her water and food and he didn't. All day I was at work, he didn't even check if she needed clean water. 

The dog thing gets me the most angry. She can't do it herself! I've been up early every day opening the store this week and I don't have that much time to clean in the morning. Ugh"
69,"I completely agree with these points. I'm an angry crier, and it's definitely a natural reaction. I don't think I could fake cry if I tried my hardest. And I hate that I cry so easily when angry or upset, and sometimes it's embarrassing. It's definitely not a ""tactic"" to win an argument."
70,"Definitely this. My boyfriend didn't believe that it was that common, then I started telling him every time someone cat called me or harassed me or started following me around. Now he's horrified, but his previous mindset seems to be the norm for a lot of guys."
71,"Cheating. It was before we were married... Like 3 years before. I only found out 2 years ago, and it took maybe a year to get over it. We have had our issues, but that was by far the biggest. 

We separated for a while. We are trying to find a place to move back in together. After a lot of therapy, conversations, and time, we are moving forward together. I didn't think holding something against him from so long ago was fair. It happened way before we got married or engaged. I have forgiven him. Other people may not forgive their partners, but some do. I think our relationship is a lot stronger now and we have learned to communicate, which has brought us so much closer. We just celebrated 10 years together, 6 married. He is my best friend, my soul mate, and so much more. 

That's not even the hardest thing we have gone through. But it was the hardest to forgive him for. "
72,Getting a D or an F on anything in high school was grounds for a mental breakdown. Now I wish I hadn't wasted so much time worrying and agonizing over my grades. 
73,"Sexism, misogyny, etc.

I know of men who think that feminism should have ended once women got the right to vote. Like, what more could we want?"
74,"When you are disrobing in front of your cutie of choice, and you find yourself thinking about every feature on your body that you consider unsightly, do yourself a solid and pretend none of that is there and you're just a sexy ghost with no physical form and you're just here to have a good time/a few orgasms and to do some poltergeist shit to your partner's genitalia. You're just here to be a happy horny haunted spectre. No need to worry about the shape or sag of your thighs or your breasts or your stomach or your skin. You're now just an untethered erogenous zone floating through space and looking for the next spot to rub on. 

Go out there and communicate what you want and enthusiastically do the things that feel good and right to you, because they'll probably feel good for your sex partner too. Don't worry about the weird noises your genitalia makes, focus on the weird pleasure noises your partner makes and feed off of that like each moan is a little dot feeding the Ms. PacMan of your self esteem. I promise that when it is done they won't be thinking ""what was the deal with her cankles tho?"" they'll be thinking ""wow are ghosts real because my junk was just possessed by the spirit of some fucking ethereal babe."""
75,"I now have a job where I make much better money, but when I was single I really don't know how I even did it.

Worked two jobs, one at a call center, the other was a pizza place.

I'd wake up at 7am, get ready for work, and take the bus (couldn't afford a car) to work. I'd make myself breakfast at work (cinnamon rolls, breakfast pizza, sometimes just a salad) since my job was pretty laid back about us eating there.

I'd work until 2pm and then I'd make myself lunch and take it with me on the bus to my next job. I'd eat lunch at my call center job and then I had to clock in by 4pm usually. I'd get off work at midnight and take the bus home. I'd usually eat a grilled cheese sandwich for dinner since bread, cheese and butter are pretty cheap. Then I'd wake up in the morning and do it all over again. 

I was working about 13 hours a day, five days a week. Eventually your body just gets used to it and you honestly don't feel that tired. I tried to think positively about everything. I was on my feet all day at the pizza shop so I lost a ton of weight, and I got most of my meals for free by working there. I saved up my tips and my money and eventually was able to move to a better area and get a higher paying job."
76,I love when I'm in a group of men and I end up talking to myself. This happens more than anyone could believe. 
77,"A few I notice all the time:

* Little boys are assumed to need to be able to run around; little boys are given more latitude to be rambunctious and act out before they are chastised. Meanwhile, in addition to being expected to behave better, little girls are often put in clothes and shoes that make it harder to run or climb or crawl, and nobody sees anything odd about this. 

* If a woman does not take the time to use verbal softeners in her language (e.g. ""I think,"" ""Maybe we should,"" ""I'm very sorry but...""), people will register this as her being harsh, rude, or bitchy.  The same language pattern in a man is not noteworthy.

* Media that is made by women or features primarily women characters is perceived as being only of interest to women.  Media made by men which features primarily men is perceived as being of interest to everyone.  This one came up relatively recently when I unthinkingly invited some male coworkers to go see Hidden Figures...silly me for thinking they'd be interested in a ""chick flick"" (????)."
78,Scars.
79,"That that woman drinking or eating solo at the bar needs a man's attention to enjoy her evening.  Seriously. It's fine to come over and say hi, but if we try to excuse ourselves politely from the conversation because we don't want to chat don't act like you are doing some grand favor to us by coming over.   SO many times after work I would sit and eat and have a beer usually pulling out a book to read for a bit before heading home.  I would make a point of being in the least occupied part of the bar and often even had headphones on. Inevitably someone would come to chat and it was a 50/50 chance that they would step away gracefully after I would (politely) let them know I was just decompressing alone before heading home.  The others would keep pressing as though I owed them conversation for being nice enough to acknowledge me at the end of the bar.  It's happened in cafes restaurants bars even at the library.  It's like men are shocked a woman might leave the house on her own and intend on entertaining herself alone and even enjoy that time by herself even in public.  How dare we!"
80,"My bf has a friend who is very sweet but he's secretly a ""nice guy"" who isn't very progressive about women. He likes traditional quiet women who know to be submissive.

He's so friendly and kind in other ways that our male friends don't get why he's so bad with women, but when I point it out all the men dismiss my concerns about him shushing our mutual female friends when they are louder or talking passionately. He also does not like progressive talk. He told us all a story about how some girl he works with called out an older coworker for sexually harassing her. He explained how he harassed her and I was livid, it was unacceptable. And he said, ""women like that need to learn to button their lip. He's old and that's just how men talk. How dare her.""

I was the only woman there at the time and so I had to relay it to our female friends. All the guys didn't get the problem... ""yeah well he's (the guy who harassed the girl) old, he's not going to change."" 

Tried explaining how calling this out is exactly what needs to happen and he (the nice guy) got super indignant. We aren't friends really anymore and our mutual female friends called him out on some other things. Now, only now, are the male friends starting to get it, but I can tell it's not fully clicked in their minds.

He's a lot more old fashioned than his jovial nice guy act would have you believe at first, but that's almost worse. He's a phony."
81,"My lack of alcohol tolerance. Women metabolize alcohol differently, I'm a small person and I eat my largest meals early in the day. I'm not hamming up when I'm buzzed off half a pint of cider. "
82,"To be active with my healthcare and to ask for help when needed  When I was younger I just thought pain was normal and let doctors convince me what I was feeling was nothing. Even when it got worse and a few treated me like I was just looking for drugs I convinced myself I was being too sensitive.  It turned out that I have MS that went undiagnosed and progressively worsening until I collapsed at my SIL's house on Christmas.  I had a few collapses at home but didn't tell anyone thinking I was being overly dramatic and I didn't want to worry anyone. My SIL is who got me to a doctor that listened (one she worked with) and who pushed until we got an answer and treatment plan. 

Now I regret not standing up for myself sooner because I might still be on my feet if I had."
83,"Surviving on 5 or 6 hours of sleep. I can't function on less than 7, and 8 is my preference. I can't imagine how great it must be to have an extra two or three hours every day. "

93,"It's always sensual and passionate, in my experience. Women are just... soft. Even when it gets rough, and there's biting and scratching and whatnot involved, the entire experience is still so soft and sensual. Perhaps my experiences with men was tainted by my hidden sexuality at the time, but sex with men always felt impersonal. It was okay, but never as good as my experiences with women. Getting a girl off is so hot, even if your fingers and wrists gets tired!! And tasting yourself on another woman's lips is honestly the hottest thing ever 😋 just make sure to tie your hair back if you have long hair, otherwise you might suffocate or strangle yourself, or fail to sexily spit your own hair out of your mouth 🙊"
94,Question said ' spouse' not 'ex'
95,"A few people have mentioned harassment but for me it's specifically cat calling. When I've talked about it to guys I know they insist it's harmless, flattering, they'd love if a girl called them ""hot"" in public etc. They don't seem to understand that it can be very intimidating and uncomfortable, to say the least."
96,"The idea that women are naturally more caring, nurturing, etc. We don't have some magic gene that makes us remember to send birthday cards, we've just frequently been socialized to believe that emotional labor is simultaneously women's responsibility and not really important."
97,"The way you phrase this story, it sounds like your bank accounts are no longer separate. With someone that irresponsible, that seems like a really bad idea..."
98,"A lot of men seem to have their mind blown when women tell them that their opinion isn't necessary. Like some men can't contemplate keeping their opinions to themselves because they're not relevant or wanted. 

Ex: man: don't you know men don't like it when women wear a lot of makeup

Woman: I don't care

Man: WHAT DO YOU MEAN HOW DARE YOU INVALIDATE MY OPINION I HAVE A RIGHT TO SPEAK MY MIND

Or

Man: but...we don't like makeup...why are you wearing it when you know we don't like it

Woman: I don't care what you think

Man: but...we don't like makeup...why are you wearing it when you know we don't like it

Repeat ad nauseam

Edit: see below the men offering their opinions on how men are so oppressed AS THOUGH ANYONE ASKED. Why it's so difficult to understand that sometimes one should just listen and not talk is beyond me but there we are."
99,"Did you read the Harry Styles interview where he sort of touched on this? I thought it was so interesting. Usually boy bands when asked about their teen girl fans they typically respond ""Oh we love our fans etc."" but sort of with the wink wink of well they are immature girls. Harry Styles said 

""Who’s to say that young girls who like pop music – short for popular, right? – have worse musical taste than a 30-year-old hipster guy? That’s not up to you to say."" ""How can you say young girls don’t get it? They’re our future. Our future doctors, lawyers, mothers, presidents, they kind of keep the world going.""


It was the first time I realized I had never even heard the bands/singers/actors who rely on young women as their fan base support those girls as PEOPLE."
100,"I love men with long hair. I guess it's not generally seen as ""unattractive,"" but, in my experience, it's pretty divisive. "

102,"This was a big thing for us too, because I never realized how people can have such different expectations for what a meal is supposed to be. Also, we disagreed for the longest time about whether we should put food on our plates and then sit and eat (the way his family did) or whether we should put all the food at the table and then sit and serve ourselves (the way my family did). I never knew that the way my family ate or the kinds of things we ate weren't the same as what everyone else did."
103,Masturbation. Realistically people don't give two shits what you do behind closed doors and it's great.
104,"I assume that the men who have women aren't online all day hating on women, because they're out doing things like having sex and raising a family and being successful. 

The people who have time to complain online all day, not so much. 

Choosing to think of it that way makes it more tolerable, but no more acceptable. "
105,Few to no stilettos involved.
106,"Having met several fantastic feminist men in my life I don't believe that it's that ""all men feel this way but internet anonymity"".

I definitely think that the internet is a (excuse the irony of me using this phrase) safe space for a lot of people who are either a) really introverted and socially awkward or b) a bit mentally unstable.

I can see how a guy, who's a bit introverted and who maybe doesn't do well with women could stumble across a place like TRP or incels and get sucked into believing it to be true.

There are some threads/comments online that do really upset me and you can't help but wonder why there are *so many* people out there who truly think women are collectively awful... But then I remember the guy who told me he was a feminist on our first date (without me broaching the subject), my male boss who out of his own pocket stocks the bathroom with tampons/pads and is so fine with me taking a day off work when I have really unbearable cramps and all the guys I've dated who've been wonderful humans.

I realise things are OK, those small men spewing hate from the safety of their keyboards have no direct impact on my life, the words they type only have power over me if I give it to them, I choose not to."
107,"My SO is late for EVERYTHING. We drive to work together and he's always late/making me wait for him, going to the movies or dinner reservations, just hanging out, etc. I just want one day where I'm not pressed for time. Ugh"
108,"Just acting like you belong, like you've done something 100 times will get you far. No matter the circumstance. My ex taught me that. I used to have weird anxiety about going into restaurants/cafes and ordering something and I did what he said and it actually worked. It's worked ever since tbh. Straight up imagining a better scenario and trying to emulate it in a situation irl or pretending to be in it works for me. New colleagues? I pretend like they're people I already know and I speak to them like I would to my friends/family, but without being weird and over eager and arrogant/presumptuous. You can always find something in someone that's similar to a person you already know. Presentation? I pretend like I'm practicing in front of my family. I've become good at tricking myself into different... feelings? Idk. I'm just glad I found something that works for me. 

Also starting a conversation by complimenting someone in whatever trivial way has yielded good results. "
109,"I'm not sure if it is what you are looking for. 

I obviously don't wish it to happen, but I dream/fantasize about something really bad to happen, terrorwise or not, and then being somewhat on the ""good"" side, trying to resolve what actually happened, being strung into a whole lot of conspiracies to find out that the good guys are actually the bad guys, and me being the one fooled, but then succeeding to resolve it all. 

I guess I want my life to be a movie. "
110,"Boyfriend and I are both employed full time but in low wage jobs. Living expenses in our city are insane but we can't afford to move.  Even if we moved,  our jobs are here and the cost of commuting would offset any savings in rent. 


We definitely struggle to make it paycheck to paycheck and it's harder every month to make rent. Every month at least two of our 4 utility bills (gas, electric, internet, phones) go unpaid. When we get paid,  we pay the things that are closest to getting shut off.


We have a car that cost $500 but we have to fix something on it every other week.  Luckily BF is mechanically inclined so we only pay for parts.  But it always costs us time he misses from work to fix it.  My work is close enough that I commute year round by bike,  regardless of weather.  


We mostly eat chicken,  beans,  rice/grains,  pasta, eggs, and frozen fruit/veggies. We rarely go out unless we're given gift cards to restaurants. We share my sibling's Netflix account or watch YouTube for entertainment.  We're both chronically exhausted. 

It's hard to see friends or be social with little money and usually I'm too tired anyways. I get up at 5:30 on weekdays and get home around 4. On weekends I catch up on neglected housework or babysit for extra cash.  Taking care of all my responsibilities outside work leaves very little time or energy for fun stuff.  We're often stressed and grumpy about how little money we have but we joke about how we can't break up cause neither of us can afford to live alone.

Edit: spelling"
111,"&gt; It's stressing me out and I can't stop wracking my brain for what I did wrong&gt;
I'm going to guess that you did nothing wrong. Some people go through life in a constant state of agitation. Don't beat yourself up. Don't spend the next 25 years trying to make this person happy. The emotional roller-coaster that he's creating is a form of mental abuse, whether intentional or not. Start considering life without him. Don't make the 25 year-long mistake that I did.

I handed the cashier my credit card and not only did she ask my date instead of me if he had their rewards card but she tried to give him my credit card too! I was so surprised I didn't say anything to her. I know it's a thing for men to pay on dates but if i'm the one giving the credit card she could have at least given it back to me.

151,"The Setagaya family murders: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setagaya_family_murder

With apparently no motive, a man breaks into a family's home and murders all 4 people inside. He the new proceeds to rummage around the house, get some food, use the bathroom, browse the internet, take a nap, and leave early the next morning. 

The guy left behind an insane amount of evidence. He was cut in the invasion, so they have his blood. They have the murder weapon and his fingerprints. He brought a change of clothes along and left the worn ones behind, so they have every sort of hair and clothing fiber possible. They have his saliva from food/soda he consumed. He didn't flush after he used the bathroom, so they have stool samples and know exactly what he ate. Because of computer access logs, they know exactly when he was in the house.

It gets better. The shirt he was wearing to the murders was one of only 130 ever sold, and when referencing it with the knife he used, they know exactly what store he bought it from, with a rough time frame of several weeks. They have eyewitness reports of the man near the house just before the murders. They have hospital records of a man being treated for the exact stab wound the man received during his attack, just off a train line several hundred miles away. They even analyzed the sand in a bag he left at the scene, and determined it to be from Edwards AFB in the US.

And with all that evidence, they don't even have a suspect"

My husband's stuff, however, was largely ""visible"" like picking up beer, changing lights, etc. Stuff that everyone can plainly see that he was doing. That disconnect really struck me"
155,"How doctors don't take some women seriously.

Between my mom, who had adenomyosis (like endometriosis but... different), my sister who has petit mal seizures, and me with some severe mental health issues, we've all been dismissed by doctors in one way or another.  
What my mom went through was very, very painful. She would bleed for months on end. Her doctor told her that, sometimes, womens periods are ""just like that"" and it's something she has to get over. lol no, she ended up needing a hysterectomy.  
My sisters petit mal seizures have been brushed off on her ""just being a ditz"", dr implied that she was doing it for attention.  
I have some pretty severe mental health issues (all under control right now) that, for a while, I didn't do much about them because my psychiatrist was 100% convinced that it was ~lady issues~. Issues flare up the week you get your period? Well, obviously hormones. The week after? Hormones still out of wack. Week before? bad PMS. So, apparently, there is only one week out of the month that I am allowed to feel bad and have it be something other than hormonal issues. Of course, even if it *were* bad pms or fucky hormones, I still need some kind of treatment (referrals to doctors that work with hormone issues as well), not dismissal. I ended up getting a different psychiatrist after a few months of visits.

I know one guy (same social circle) who is 50 and for years has been ""oh, you poor women limited by your biological clock."" His plan was first a career and then a family.

In his 40s he decided he was ready for a family, and went on about evolution, alpha males, etc always summarizing by saying that he was now (for biological reasons) looking for a wife in her 20s to have children with. And, yes, he says it that way - as if the woman is solely an incubator.

To his shock he can't find women in their 20s that meet his standards and are aligned with his plan. So reluctantly he will now look at women +/- 30 years, and is angry that they don't see how lucky they are.

168,"Went out for a date night with my so and were having some after dinner drinks when an older man and his grown sons interrupted.  All good, just tourists and we're friendly enough people.  Only, they and my so formed a chat huddle, blocking me out and when I did attempt to interject, they talked over me or disregarded me.  I even made a joke that got completely ignored only to have my *male* so repeat the same joke with the same inflection immediately after to a roar of laughter.  I spent the following hour growing pissy about the men's club. "

170,"I used to not like pubic hair, but I admit it has grown on me."
171,"Being an atheist. Growing up I was taught they were the most evil people on the planet. There was almost no one worse than an atheist.

Guess who is a non-believer and hasn't murdered anyone, molested a child, or made a pact with a dark power? If you said me, you're right! "
172,"&gt;The only one who puts you first is you unless you get really, really stupidly lucky.  

I work with teens. Thank you for putting so eloquently into words what I try to explain to these young women. When, at 17 they tell me that they want to get pregnant because ""he's got a good job. He'll look after me""

I hate raining on people's relationship parades by saying ""what if he doesn't? How will you support yourself and your child when you don't even have a high school diploma?!"" I'm going to use your line from now on! "
173,"If you want someone to do something for you, the magic word is ""because.""

174,"When I found out that I lost a second baby in under a year (no living children, other losses prior to those two) he basically ran out of the doctors office and came back 10 minutes later. I know it was because he was devastated too, but a year later and pregnant again, I still get upset at him leaving me there trying to figure out what the next step was to actually make the physical loss happen. There have been some other things, but that was the most recent big thing. I know it doesn't sound that huge, but being alone at that time was the last thing I needed. "
175,"nope. i actually didn't even know his account before i found the story. i found it on a subreddit i didn't realize we both frequented and recognized enough details within the story to be confident that it was his account, so i confronted him. "
176,"This is one I didn't know I harbored until it was pointed out to me.  Bands/groups/tv shows/etc. that have a primarily female fanbase are dismissed as stupid, untalented, and ""they only like them because they're cute/hot!""  This is particularly true if the fanbase consists of teenage girls.  Because they're shallow and stupid, right?  On the other hands, bands and such that have a mixed or primarily male fanbase are seen as talented, creative, intelligent, and so forth.

When I was younger and forever looking for new music, I would automatically dismiss any band that was popular with girls.  I just thought, ""They must not be very talented.""  I don't think I consciously made the connection between the talent and the female fans, but in hindsight, it was a definite thing.  I still find myself thinking like this, but I'm able to catch it now."

This can't be real."
182,"One time back when my husband and I were dating, he was really excited to make smoothies with his sister's new Ninja blender she had gotten for Xmas (we were all home for the holidays). We used all the fruit we had and it was just enough for two smoothies. I drank mine and when he went to the bathroom, I drank like half of his. I had no impulse control. 

I felt bad about that for YEARS. "

184,"My gyno used to tell me funny stories about his kids or friends during our exam. He would start as soon as he was getting ready to sit down and perform the exam, stop to say, ""it's going to be cold"" or ""I'm going to insert x now"" and as soon as I acknowledged it, he would go back to his story. I was always so interested in his stories that i would be a lot less occupied with what he was doing. The female gyno I had never made any kind of small talk and I would just lay there in a quiet room while she examined me. Very awkward. "

187,"She was the perfect housewife. She just smiled and did whatever was asked of her. Her house was always perfect, it was part of the garden tour in the city, everything was perfect perfect perfect. She gave me a cookbook of all her recipes that she had bound called ""Cooking with X"" (wherein x is my ex's name, of course) with a picture of him as a 4 year old helping her cook on the cover and made a meeting with me to go over it and her other expectations for his home. Any deviation from the ""rules"" of how she cleaned or cooked and he freaked the hell out. I pretty much lived in hell, and wish we had lived together before we got married because I think I would have ran after two days. I could deal with the cooking because he wasn't a bad cook, but since he took over all the cleaning and crap too after I wasn't measuring the carpet vacuum lines right none of it was getting done. AGH. She never worked other than volunteering, and I worked and volunteered and was in grad school. I could not be her."

191,"I LOVE scars. My husband has a scar that looks like a stab wound and I think it's so sexy. Like some sort of gladiator that got into a fight and came out victorious.

194,"I get more compliments and attention when I wear it vs when I don't, so I feel better about myself. (Guys would look better too if they would cover up their acne and skin splotches.) There's also social pressure to wear it as part of dressing up.

Do I shave my legs to trick guys into thinking I'm naturally hairless? Should I stop doing that because it's dishonest and unnatural? I'm betting these same guys would say no, they definitely think women should keep shaving their legs. "
195,"I seriously believe this has something to do with the impact of technology on our lives.  Now used to reading in tiny bursts, like text messages, comment sections , etc. So i think you're brain gets trained.

I have recently ""taken back "" movies as well.  I could no longer sit and watch a film for two hours which was a horrible shame. I forced myself a few times and can enjoy it again . After years on YouTube my brain couldn't focus anymore "

197,LOL I'm laughing so hard
198,"THANK YOU. I get that it seems like a joke when women have forgiven cheating and what have you, but this would piss me off so fucking much. It is way too damn deliberate. People who can't respect others people's things (especially things that people really enjoy) are people I cannot date or be friends with. This is a literal deal breaker for me. "
199,"I did and it helped heaps...until my now ex stopped trying. 

We had a great counselor who put us in our place when we needed to be, who told us truths and helped us navigate what and where our issues were. It helped me work on my self and where I was in the relationship. 

it was only until i realised that there was not any more work on the relationship her or I could do to improve it, my ex just didn't want to see the issues he was causing nor did he want to take responsibility for them. He straight up refused to accept any wrong doing or that he as well had grow and work on his issues. 

Couples's therapy helped us heaps, even if only to help me realise that my now ex husband didn't give a shit about the relationship and made me realise I was right to separate.  

Sorry if this isnt the answer you were seeking. "
200,Drinking to the point of getting drunk.  The aftermath is not worth it.  My body can no longer deal with alcohol like it could when I was younger.  Hangovers are miserable and last for days.
201,"I'm a 911 dispatcher. We get a little bit of everything, but we definitely have the frequent inappropriate callers that think it's a sex line, not a line for emergency services.
There's this one guy who would call repeatedly, with porn playing in the background, you can hear him jacking off, &amp; asking questions and grunting.

The shitty part when dealing with these kinds of callers, is that (depending on department policy) you'll have to stay on the line and determine that an emergency truly does not exist… while they are demeaning you or being creepy gross.

We also get people who call for legitimate reasons, then say things like ""you have a lovely voice, can I call you when you get off of work?"" And things of that sort."
202,"If you know someone has a general dislike for you, ask them for a minor favor. Something they can't possibly object to without seeming rude or hateful. Be polite, thank them, and tell other people how nice it was if them to do it in front of them (just don't over do it.) Our brains are hard wired to think we do nice things for people we like, and getting someone who dislikes you to do something nice for you tricks their brain into thinking they like you.

I learned this from Benjamin Franklin. He would ask to borrow a book from people he knew didn't like him. It really works too. When I taught I turned students who hated me into students who thought I was the best by asking them to pass back papers."
203,"Bi woman here. Sex can last for hours. It's very soft, women's bodies are soft in general. It's more about the woman's personality than anything physical, if that makes sense. You want to please her because you care so much that she's a wonderful person, you're not really concerned if she cums or not, because that's the icing on the cake. It's not a huge part of the sex that's very important the male during sex. 

Males are always saying ""I just want you to cum. Please cum for me."" 

Female are more like ""I want to give you my full attention for hours. If you cum that's great, but if not don't worry. Let's just go slow and enjoy each other fully.""

Keep in mind this isn't always true for every sex always, but it is pretty realistic. Males tend to want to pleasure your body to make you have a great time. Female tend to want to pleasure your mind hoping that your body follows. 


Also, no nails. Cut that shit off. 
There's no ""man"" in the relationship either. 

Some lesbians tend to go by different categories if they want though. Butch, femme, or futch. All depending on looks. Or the type of girl they personally prefer. 



"
204,"Tribbing (which is vag to vag in missionary and cow girl positions, among other positions) is the number one thing lesbians do, in my experience and the lesbians I know. However, I did not know about tribbing until I became a full on lesbian and hooked up with other experienced lesbians. Back in the early days, I just did oral and fingering. Now it's 90% tribbing. I mean it's the best! Full body contact, clit to clit... Goddamn."
205,"Because I like to be sparkly occasion. 

What about beards? I see y'all hiding your weak ass chins."
206,"What they mean is a girl they personally find hot doing it. Not an ugly woman and definitely not a big bear of a man twice his size. Especially either of these in groups.

They also don't mean every minute they walk outside. They would get tired of it and are too naive or proud to admit it."
207,"He's not my spouse yet, but we've lived together for years. I'd have to say it was letting his mother treat me badly. She spread rumors about me, would tell him that he should dump me, bad-mouthed me behind my back, and was very rude to me. I finally told him that either he starts sticking up for me or I can't be in the relationship anymore. 

I forgave him easily though after I started understanding why he was so unwilling to stand up to her. He was in foster care as a child because he was abused. I had assumed that she had apologized and they'd worked through it since they seemed to get along. Actually she had manipulated him into believing the abuse was his fault and he hurt her by getting taken away. So he felt guilty for what he was told he had done to her. Thank goodness we no longer talk to his family. "
208,Finish your degree first and foremost. Never put a man before your own self interests. Learn to keep your mouth shut. Put something into retirement every year.

210,"F60 here. I actually find being invisible quite liberating, though it sometimes proves dangerous when walking near young men with backpacks! Having said that, I am still  visible to anyone my age or older than me..there's a secret smile us old ladies share with eachother in shops and on public transport, like 'hey, I see you!'

Thanks to the menopause I remain exactly the same person throughout the month, no dramas, no tears, no mad cleaning binges. It's wonderful.

Despite maintaining a high level of fitness throughout my life, my physical strength has dropped off significantly and these days I need help opening jars. Sometimes I go to stand up from sitting at floor level and absolutely nothing happens. I end up crawling around until I can find a prop!

All my family of origin have passed now and it's quite weird being the last one carrying our memories. It sometimes makes me feel lonely but they're often present in my dreams with no awareness on my part that they're actually gone.

Sex at 50 was mind blowing, which I never expected. 

I view my ageing body and face with the same detached curiosity that I did as a teenager going thru puberty. It's a relentless and impersonal process moving through my body whilst I remain myself on the inside.

219,"Oh my God, when I was very little I used to see ads for Always pads all the time. They were on tv way too much. The women in them were always out in the sun doing goddamn sports in white pants. And I was so little and had some vague idea about periods. So my takeaway from all these dumbass ads was that a period was something that's gonna make me like sports. I could see myself playing tennis, going sailing, skipping everywhere like a fucking lunatic. Just like the ads! Gotta love the way kid brains work. I even asked my mom if I will love outdoor activities while a period lasts. "
220,"When my husband and I first met, my mom gave me one job with her Crock pot chicken noodle soup: put in the noodles... I ended up putting in the entire bag of noodles, not even thinking. That was the first time my future husband saw me bawl over something so stupid. "
221,"I've only experienced it once early in my career. Honestly didn't even need to deal with it because he made a fool out of himself all on his own. 

Dude was FURIOUS that I caught an error he made prior to the documents being sent out to a customer and he tried to argue that he wasn't wrong because I was ""new and didn't know how anything works"" in the meeting with the entire engineering department, and people (including his boss) had to step in and tell him I was right.

After the meeting he pretended he needed my help but then unleashed a whole lecture on me about how he could tell I was ""timid and afraid to speak up"" (lol) and I shouldn't be because he ~knows how hard it is to be a woman because he's got daughters and he's afraid of how they'll be treated when they grow up. Yeah, so you're afraid your daughters will be treated the way you've treated women all your life? That's rich.

It was funny because his boss ended up routing all his work to me to be double checked before it was sent out. I'm sure it just KILLED him."

223,"I think that sometimes dark fantasies allow you to imagine what it would be like being much more powerful. Having the power to take a life, hold a gun and get paid, be feared, etc. I'm actually not attracted to that, though when I was a kid I would shoplift, vandalize, and one B&amp;E. 

Now though, I find myself imagining myself as the savior. Having to fight a gun man, give someone CPR, flip a car to save a life. I think it kind of goes along the same thought process though. 

Actually, I really want to get into a fist fight. I used to fight a lot as a kid/teen and I haven't been in one in like 10+ years. I'd just like to see if I still got it. Haha "

227,"Anything to do with diamonds/jewelry. That one where they're like, ""Two diamonds, one for your best friend, one for your true love, because they're both!"" They're probably beside themselves that they found a way to justify two diamonds in a ring. Another one is the Levian chocolate diamonds thing. In the past, brown diamonds would be considered ""impure"" and not good enough for making into jewelry. Then, they must have been sitting around one day and had a spark of genius. ""Women love diamonds...women love chocolate...I know! We'll just call those crappy brown diamonds 'chocolate' diamonds, and women will snatch them up like candy!""

Also, relating anything diamond to love. ""The Vera Wang Love collection"" of diamond jewelry. Diamonds mean love, everyone, so make sure to buy your woman a diamond, or you don't love her!"

229,"I think while embarrassing, it is necessary. If you are so fat you take up two seats, you pay for them rather than making someone incredibly uncomfortable on the same journey, and compromising any technical side of things. "
230,"This is called stonewalling, and it's very toxic for relationships. A couple's therapist I know, says most of her clients who end up divorced, one of them was a stonewaller' in the relationship. It's not so much the lack of communication that's toxic but the intent behind the stonewalling that is. It's often used as a means to control an argument or disagreement in their favor by giving you silent treatment until you eventually drop the subject thus never having to learn to compromise together. It seems your partner is using this as an attention seeking behavior rather than coming forth and talking why he's upset. He makes a big production in storming off, ignoring your attempts at communicating, and disappears for a few days, knowing you will be conserned, thus upon his return, he will be coddled emotionally by you. This is him manipulating you and do not give him a pass for acting like this just because he has a mental illness, I'm very sure he knows full well what he is doing. I think you need to ask yourself if this relationship is worth overcoming the disrespect from a partner who uses this behavior to manipulate you, if so I recommend a couple's counselors ASAP."

236,"Men have trouble understanding this because its one area where sexual dimorphism is really big and they don't realize it.

There are three types of sweat glands in the body:  

* One reacts to heat and produces a clear fluid meant to evaporate and cool us down.  It is found all over the body.  This one is pretty much the same in both genders.  
* Another reacts to stress hormones and produces a milky fluid with a distinct oder.  They are found on the forehead, armpits, groin, the palms of the hand, and on either side of the nose.  They are 2 times larger in men than women.  Men also have over an order of magnitude more of them.  If I have two of them on my palm my husband has closer to 30.  They are also more sensitive/reactive in men.  This is why men have ""nervous"" or ""cold"" sweats and women don't. 
* The last is the tear ducts - which are a modification on the stress based sweat gland.  They are 3 times larger in women than in men and thus produce more fluid for the same amount of emotional agitation.   Additionally, men and women alike have a shunt from the tear ducts to the sinuses that reclaims excess fluid - but this tube is several times wider in men than women meaning they can wick away more tears than women can - so they have to produce more tears out of their tiny tear ducts before they visibly overflow onto the face.

As a result the *average* woman will visibly cry at a lower stress level than the average man.  Your milage may vary.  There are men with larger tear ducts and tinier sinuses and women with smaller.  

Not understanding this means most men have extreme difficulty correctly gauging the stress level of a woman who is visibly crying a little.  "
237,....God damn
238,"I hear ya. First, when I hadn't figured out the whole masturbation thing and didn't know what worked for me, I had guys telling me I was lying when I said I'd never had an orgasm.

Once I got it down and knew what worked, I got told I was faking. (It basically takes nothing to make me come. It's not an achievement; I'm easy mode. It's actually an achievement to be so bad I don't even come once)

Now I'm with a guy who has a kink for making his partners orgasm lots. It works out *really* well for the both of us."
239,"If I describe an individual of power, people assume they're male. For example, if I told someone something a consultant told me, they might respond with, ""Yeah, he..."".

She came over asking if we knew anything about computers and could help troubleshoot an issue she was having, because she had a webinar in a few minutes and was totally lost. I asked a few questions and figured out it was a software issue. My SO is fantastic with hardware problems but knows shit-all about software, whereas I'm the opposite. So we went down there, I figured out the problem, reconfigured some things, and got it all up and running for her. She turns and thanks my husband while telling him, ""you must be great at computers."" We were both dumbfounded. He pointed to me and said, ""I didn't even do anything, she did,"" but the woman just kind of brushed it off. Apparently my husband taught me everything I know. She did not get help from us again. "

But I was pissed for a long time that he didn't trust me. He also wouldn't tell me who had said I was cheating. After a while I finally realized that if someone had told me that about him I'd have probably doubted him too, because you just feel like if someone tells you your SO is cheating on you there's no reason for them to lie. 

I've forgiven him now, but I'm still a little annoyed that he's never told me what friend told him this. "

Anyway I was apologising because it wasn't very pleasant (still edible) and he kept insisting it was fine. I offered to fix up something else quickly but he declined. There was quite a bit leftover because I ate a relatively small portion. My SO washed up since I had cooked and I asked him to bin the leftovers. He said there were no leftovers. I was confused. I said ""You ate the whole thing? There was loads leftover!""

And he turns to me and goes, ""I think you seriously underestimate how much I love your cooking.""

And I know he ate it because he wanted me to feel better. There is just no way he actually enjoyed the meal. It was rubbery and weird, the flavours didn't go and he's just as discerning with food as I am. So yeah..."

I make a quick and easy dip where you literally mix a can of no bean chili w/ a package of cream cheese on the stove and even though I've told him there was no skill involved, his mind was blown and he brags to everyone about how amazing it is. Bad news is that everyone comes over thinking I'm like Rachel Ray and leaves obviously disappointed after eating my meals because he won't stop telling them how good my food is. 

In the end I don't mind. I'm just happy to feed my family some home cooked meals and I know his passion about my cooking is just happiness that someone is cooking him a meal with love :) "

 How often they tone police us or expect us to behave in stereotypical ways and get angry when we don't do it. 

I can't tell you how many times in my life I've been told ""That's wayyyy harsh!"" when I say something in the most even, unemotional, dispassionate tone. Nothing I said was mean or rude, it was just honest and to the point, but they're so used to women softening and adjusting how they speak that they can't handle being talked to like an adult by a woman. Sometimes I'm even laughing and joking around but it's still taken poorly by guys. It's 10000 times worse if you are saying things that aren't perfectly complimentary towards men like I'm doing right now then no matter how you said it, it's angry and harsh and mean and salty and overreacting. If a guy said the exact same thing I said in the exact same tone, no one would say anything. It would be normal. In fact, guys can say the meanest, vilest, hateful, ugliest shit and people are still okay with it.

I also bought him a cheapo ring that he wears to work, so it's not a big deal if he loses it.

301,"Not currently below the poverty line but I was allot 2 years ago.

Day to day, was kind of a blur.

I had a paid for vehicle, so that was good, and made it easy to get to interviews. I couldn't really use it for anything else because gas was too expensive. Hell, public transportation was too existence.

Weekly groceries consisted of soup mostly. Couldn't have fancy stuff like Kraft Dinner because then you have to buy butter/margarine and milk. I guess when the poverty started I had stuff like that, but once it ran out I couldn't afford to restock.

Blankets were really important because gas and hydro are expensive so I'd save by not running that furnace or air conditioner (which really sucked in summer because I like on the top floor corner unit where my walls face west/south). 

I had to keep the internet hooked up to search for jobs and stuff, so I did have that and a borrowed Netflix account for entertainment. 

Every now and then when I could scrape together $10 I'd buy a bottle of wine for dinner because day in and day out is exhausting and depressing just being stuck. And it helps you sleep. There is the stress that keeps you up at night, but no mental/social simulation and mind numbing boredom every single day also make it so you aren't really tired. Also, if you didn't eat much/anything, the hunger will bother you more at night when you're trying to fall asleep. I think my sleep schedule got to be like 3am-5am, then 8 am-10am.

A lot of the social stuff is different than you expect. There was a lot of debate for me. I could drag myself over to my sister's house and she would feed me and we'd hang out which would be great mentally. But she has never been poor. At the time, she was making around $82k/year and living with her husband, so convinced income in six figures. My income at the time was $636/month. A whole lot of ""why don't you just get a job"" type stuff. I was trying, obv.

She resents that my parents helped me to keep a roof over my head. She thinks the handouts make me the favourite, when realistically they just didn't want me moving back in with them. We're also probably on roughly an equal playing field at this point since they gave her $10k for her wedding, and $30k for her education. 

I was regularly nervous that I might lose weight because I only had one blazer and pair of trousers, so what happened if I got an interview but could only look sloppy? Luckily the vast quantities of sodium made me bloat so it was not too apparent if I lost anything.

Cleaning supplies are very expensive, so you don't wash the sheets or clean the bathroom as much as you should.

The episode where Carrie dates a bi guy was also handled horribly. Charlotte is okay with being in an MFF threesome yet she thinks bisexuality doesn't exist?

321,"This is true to a degree, bur every woman wants to cum if possible. If it's not happening, its ok to let it go and move on. The whole focus of sex shouldn't be on the orgasm. Just like the way a man who has erectile issues doesn't want all the focus to be on how he maintains his erection, you can still have an enjoyable experience either way. But, to think a woman doean't want to cum is just wrong. 

The problem is that so many men will focus on the woman just long enough to warm her up and get her ready for him to enter, then afyer it's all about his pleasure. If she cums, it's usually because she takes matters into her own hands. Then, when he gets off, it's all over. He still has hands and a mouth, but his erection is gone so therefore sex is over.

I had just finished university and didn't really have a career to speak of, and I figured it would be a fun adventure and a good way to start our lives off together.  I quit my job and gave up my apartment, and a month before I was set to move, he decided that it was too much commitment to ask me to move all that way for him.  He didn't communicate it very well to me at the time - he basically told me that he was enjoying living by himself and didn't want to resent me for moving in and changing that.  We broke up for awhile, and then he got in touch and apologized.  He explained himself much better after having a few months to think about things - saying that he *was* enjoying the new city, but he had been worried I wouldn't adjust well, and he was terrified that I would be unhappy there.

I wouldn't say I've 100% forgiven him yet, but we are back together and working through it.  I did take the possibility of me moving to his new city off the table, because I have found a career I love and I wouldn't be able to do it if I moved.

If I'm being honest with myself, not being willing to move is also kind of a ""I was willing to do it for him, and he didn't want me to, so if he wants to get back together, he needs to be willing to do the same"".  I know it's not 100% healthy, but the whole situation made me feel like the relationship was pretty one-sided and kind of only on his terms, so I'm feeling like I need to make sure my needs are prioritized too."

Consequently we are halfway through 2017 and I haven't seen his family *once*.  But I have seen mine 5 times (I use a counter app on my phone to track how often we see each family).

339,"Not original commenter but i think I can relate what they're describing as I get it all the time. In public settings like doctor's office, dentist, grocery store, shopping, food counters etc. when you wait in line or at a counter or search store aisles for help finding something people tend to just not really notice you. If you sit in a group of chairs like a waiting room nobody wants to sit next to you (which I actually don't mind so much). If you address employees at these places directly they quickly pass you off to someone else (if they even notice). I guess it's generally a dismissive attitude from most people. I chalk this up to RBF but who knows. 
 
To answer OP's question: Body-ugh just out of control after 40. If you're under 35 get in shape NOW or you'll be quite sorry. Mind-much sharper than it used to be but unfortunately not too many people notice this except yourself. Spirit-I don't really give a shit what 99.999% of people think.

344,"This happened to my sister. She had a weird persistent cough for six months and the drs kept saying 'take buckleys' or 'its bronchitis' or 'its pneumonia'. My mum (her step mum) finally convinced her to demand a chest x-ray, so she did from a walk in clinic. By the end of the next day she was in hospital being treated for stage four non-hodgkins lymphoma, with a football sized tumor in her chest, and told she might only have three days left. It's been 14 years and she's doing fine now, but if it had been caught earlier she might not have needed as much chemo or a bone marrow transplant. Definitely a good idea to stand up for yourself medically. "
345,"Not to ruin things here, but all your teenagers are going to say ""*well I am stupidly lucky! he isn't like anyone else in the world!*"""
346,"This is the biggest pet peeve of my life right now. Being interrupted/talked over, or having my contributions to the conversation ignored like I never said a word. It seems like it happens ALL THE TIME. Ugh. And every time I try to point it out, no matter how politely, everyone looks all eye-rolley and gets defensive.

I mean damn, just let me talk every once and a while!"
347,"Its the opposite with me.

First real job. And im sorrounded by those old people who have been in the field for minimum 30+ years versus me with a school backgground.

Its not fun. Its actually really depressing and not a healthy work environment. Please send help."
348,"I had an ex that wanted me to deep throat him and insisted that it ""is easy"" I told him when he could deep throat a hotdog then I would think about it. He tried one time, very nearly vomited, and never asked again. I should have made him do it with a bratwurst. "
349,"That's plain silly. Dove has been annoyingly condescending in their ""beauty"" campaign for a while now. 

I also find Always pads advertisements to be condescending. Hearing ""have a happy period"" is the mental equivalent of pulling out a dry tampon. You know damned well that we're not having a happy period. "
350,Whaaat did he realize you knew his account?
351,"He can't do anything to me he wouldn't want me to do to him.

Which took anal off the table immediately. "

353,"I sometimes think I might want a kid or two, but the idea of pregnancy outright terrifies me. It seems like living in a prison made out of your own body."
354,"Yes! There is so much misinformation about this! Every time someone mentions 35 I try to tell them that's not true - and I point to all the people who go through ivf at that age only to conceive naturally later.  Apparently the 35 thing is from a centuries old study in France with a sample size of like 12 people. Every recent study shows fertility doesn't have a sharp decline until 40. 

Edit: apparently I made up the sample size part haha.  But the rest I stand by!"

356,"i went to couples therapy with my spouse - he was really reluctant to go, and acted very badly during sessions.  however, i went to a few sessions on my own, and found it really helpful.  we broke up about six months after trying the counselling thing.  

a friend of mine had a bad situation with her husband, he had an affair while she was pregnant, and they went to therapy and worked out their issues &amp; are together and functioning much more strongly now that it's a couple years down the line...so i think it can work for a lot of people.  it just didn't help in my case."

358,"It's not just metabolism, but a lot of people go from walking around all the time at college to sitting at a desk for eight hours a day.  Watch what you eat and don't let yourself get fat.  Seriously.  It's amazing how huge amounts of weight can sneak up on you over a decade.  It's a lot harder to lose the weight than to keep it off in the first place."
359,"x2. My parents are so old school and they grounded the idea in us kids that sex before marriage = us going to hell. I've had my fair share of partners, but now I understand how instrumental sexual compatibility is, and how sad it would be to wait and find out the chemistry isn't there after you're married."
360,"Staying up late. I hate being up past 11, because I know I'll be tired the next day."
361,I could not get the VCR to work and I really wanted to watch Star Wars. 
362,Yeah and wearing a black bra under a white garment.
363,"Agreed. Also, on a vehicle that *flies people through the air,* weight is a factor and space is a commodity, otherwise everyone would be given tons of legroom, etc."
364,"Me: ""I don't think I want kids""  
  
Mum: ""But look how cute your neighbour's kid is, look how happy they are, don't you want that?""  
  
Me: ""yeah he's cute, but I'd be perfectly happy without kids""  
  
Mum: ""You want to be unmarried AND childless? What a sad life. No-one wants that""  
  
Me: ""I do""  
  
Mum: ""That's what sick people say...it's abnormal""  
  
Me: *sigh*"

366,"The other annoying response is stories about *tougher* petite women they know who can drink me under the table. What does it matter that I'm small, delicate and easily poisoned? These stories don't inspire me to cultivate a tolerance. "
367,"yeah, I follow MMA and I was telling a guy friend about something he had asked about and he said straight up he would never date a girl like me that knew more about a sport he was interested in than him.  It made him intimidated and ""less"" because I knew so much. "
368,"When you told him you weren't ready for kids?

I wish you all the best, but keep your eyes open and don't give up on your own plans."
369,Thank you so much for your kind words. I really hope you're right and that I'm helping him. x
370,"Pretty much. My exboyfriend freaked out the first time I got cat-called while with him. He was super disgusted, and when he realized I wasn't reacting at all, turned and asked if I hadn't understood what they said. I had explain that yes I had heard them, it just wasn't anything out of the ordinary.

He had heard me complain about cat-calling in the past, but it took him not only observing it, but observing my non-reaction to it to fully recognize both how crude and how common it was."
371,Not happening. I take my food seriously. And I would like to order what I want to eat. Pass. 
372,"I have two: I accidentally stood on a snail, and started thinking about its snail family it would never see again and burst into tears. 
Second one is I can burst into tears if I look at my dog and realise how much I actually love her "

374,"Walking barefoot. Turns out no, I'm not getting a massive cold just by walking barefoot accross the patio in winter.

God now I just remember all the rules my mum had about me being properly clothed to avoid cold and my blood rises. I'M NOT GOING TO GET THE FLU FOR NOT HAVING A JACKET, STOP IT."
375,Every other day usually. Unless I'm extra sweaty or active that day. Any more and hair and my skin gets super dry. 
376,"If that's what works,  I'm all for it. Two of my brothers stayed at home with their kids the first few years because their wives earned more money.  They both loved it.  

A few years ago,  I encouraged my boyfriend to quit his job and stay at home for awhile.  His job was so stressful that I started seriously worrying about his health,  and they weren't paying him nearly enough for how hard he was working.  I figured he was already at my place most of the time anyway,  might as well move in and save some money.  I earned enough to support us both.  I encouraged him to quit his job and take a few months to decompress and work, work on his art,  and take his time finding a better job.  It was great! I loved coming home to a clean place,  laundry done,  errands run,  dinner ready,  and a happy man.  Our time together got to be actual quality time.  10/10 Would have a stay at home boyfriend or husband again.  "
377,"guy sounds like a real asshole
"
378,I'm glad you have a relationship you value enough to work through something like that. I hope you're not taking too much flak for your choice to forgive and work things out. The internet can be an especially harsh place for this.
379,"He lied to me about having graduated from college.

He'd taken an incomplete in a class and was dragging his feet on finishing that one last class required to graduate while working full time.  Then he lost his job and had nothing but time in which to fix it.  He still didn't get it done.  I told him that we weren't going to get married until the degree was in hand, so he supposedly knuckled down and finished it.

It wasn't until after we'd been married for six months, he still didn't have a job, and wouldn't let me see the resumes he was supposedly sending out that I realized he probably hadn't finished the degree.  The part I really had a hard time forgiving is that he got angry and tried to gaslight me when I confronted him about it, though he eventually admitted it.

I had to insist on seeing him email the department chair to set up a plan for finishing the credit, seeing the paper he needed to finish, and eventually the diploma when it arrived.  

I seriously considered getting an annulment over it, but I'm very glad I didn't.  The entire thing was very out of character, and he'd been pretty depressed at the time.  It took a long time to rebuild trust, but as far as I'm aware he's never lied about anything important again.  He wound up landing his dream job and has been steadily working his way up the ranks to a very comfortable position.  We have two fantastic kids, and he's a really, really good father.  Honestly he probably parents those kids better than I do."

381,"the ""i am very smart"" type -- corrects grammar/word choice without being asked, argues pedantic shit, insists on playing devil's advocate, etc. is usually a defensive beer snob, too.

the ""i am my subculture"" type -- smokes weed and *everyone* knows because they wear tacky pot leaf accessories and turn it into their entire identity. or they're ""geeky"" and every aspect of their life revolves around showing off/proving how geeky they are. just two examples of the type i see most often, but there's endless types to this one. "
382,"Just...keep a close eye on it. The post from a few days ago about the woman whose husband drained her (I think) $30k+ savings account on Twitch donations scared the shit out of me, and I'm a single straight dude, about as far from a housewife as you can get."
383,"I remember my female friends in high school were shocked at how I talked to my puppies. You know, that stupid high-pitched baby voice full of love because they're SO DAMN ADORABLE"
384,"A lot of people don't like penetration at all, so it's possible she just never needs to use her fingers that way!"
385,"I think a lot of people say sexist things about children that they wouldn't apply to adults. In general I think it's more acceptable to assume say girls are into princesses and boys are into cars, that girls would rather do a quiet coloring activity and boys want to go on the climbing frame etc. And it's not always obvious things either. Stuff like, ""Oh he's not really into reading but my daughter is. Boys huh?"" Or dismissing stories and advice from other people as not applicable to your children because of gender. "

387,"Hey.. :)  I'm so sorry for what you've been through, and what you've had to feel and think and hear from other people.  All I can offer are some humble words of advice, to do with as you will..

* *You* are the only one who deserves to decide what happens to your body.  Not whoever decided what a ""normal woman"" should want.  Not your guy.  Not your family, not anyone else.  *You.*  This decision is about your body and your life.

* It's *ok* to not want kids.  It's *ok* to want them.  It's *ok* to adopt or have them biologically.  And it is *ok* to not be sure what option is best for you.  Be proud that you're a responsible, conscientious person who is considering the options carefully.

* Just because you haven't met a man who would adopt, doesn't mean they aren't out there.  :)  Please be sure to ask or try to persuade, if they're open to it..!  If you decide that adoption or a childfree life are right for you, a man will only be right for you if he respects your decisions and shares your lifestyle preferences.
* I would gently suggest that, if you're truly not sure about kids, that to ""err on the side of caution"" would mean, for you, forgoing pregnancy.  You mention many (well-founded) fears and concerns about it, but few compelling arguments for going through with it.  It shouldn't be that you ""*want* to want"" kids, or just think it's ""normal"", or about what other people want or say; it should be that *you* want kids.  And if you're not fairly sure about it, I think it would be much less tragic to regret forgoing pregnancy (and happiness missed), than to regret going through with it (and suffer its damages).

Whatever seems right to you, I wish you the best in pursuing it.  :)"
388,"It's always when you've had a bit of a bad day and you've consoled yourself with the knowledge of leftover pizza, too. You've hyped up these leftover slices like they're the finest culinary delight to exist and then you get home and...

389,"going to extreme lengths to have biological children instead of adopting. i was adopted, so i get that my viewpoint is pretty different from most people's. and i do understand the many reasons why people would want to have biological children. and i can totally see why even someone who is really open to adoption might choose biological children if it's easy to get pregnant...i mean, adopting is expensive and a lot of work.

but i know a couple who spent years trying to get pregnant and hundreds of thousands of dollars in fertility treatments and IVF, and i *really* didn't understand why they wouldn't even entertain the idea of adoption. on top of that, the mother had a ton of health issues (including being chronically underweight) to begin with, and her eventual pregnancy was as horrible as we all knew it would be. so basically they spent more time and money than they would've spent on an adoption, for a pregnancy that everyone knew was going to be extremely stressful on her body, so they could have biological kids.
