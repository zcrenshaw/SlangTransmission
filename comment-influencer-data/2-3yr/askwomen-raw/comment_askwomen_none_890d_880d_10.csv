0,"I'm happy my guy doesn't say shit that shows how little he knows me. But I can think of a good example that stuck with me. 

I work for a contractor and we were completely overhauling an old, dated house for a couple in their 40s who had just bought it. One day early on, we were meeting on site with the clients and the husband was explaining how they were going to use the space. He stood in one room and said ""This will be my office."" 

Then he gestured to another room. ""And this will be Amy's (his wife's) room. I think we'll put the TV in here so she can watch her soap operas or whatever it is women do during the day."" 

The wife looked horrified and said ""Um, I don't watch soaps and that is NOT what I do all day."" Keep in mind they had a newborn baby. 

""Yeah yeah,"" he dismissed her with a wave of his hand and a ""Calm down, sweetie, you're overreacting again!"" tone of voice. He continued talking. I couldn't stop looking over at his wife, who was shooting daggers at him with her eyes for the remainder of the meeting. 

He turned out to be a real asshole too. "
1,"A year ago I ended up sharing an apartment with my childhood best friend. I've had my chronic illnesses for what feels like forever but diagnosed five years ago. 
She had some friends over in the living room doing whatever they do. I was huddled over the bathroom toilet, I flushed the toilet and left to grab my water bottle and medication I left in my bedroom. When I came back out to go back to the bathroom she called me out in front of her friends. ""Jesus, we all know you're sick. No reason to keep rubbing it in our  faces.""
And I just cried in the bathroom, I couldn't comprehend how she thought I was trying to rub it in her face? Like what is there to even rub in? Haha I feel like shit, get fucked nerd. Sorry, I'm still a little upset about that.

Edit: I wasn't expecting so many responses but thank you for the positive support, it's highly appreciated!"
2,"Romanticizing motherhood to the point of loss of identity. My kid is not the best thing that ever happened to me, he is not the most perfect, sweetest angel, he is not my life. He's just my kid. Being a mom is not a superpower, it doesn't make me special or unique or deserving of extra praise. 

I love him, but ""mom"" is very low on my list of self-identifier. I refuse to let myself be known as some kind of nutty momtyr."
3,"I was part of the support-and-modding-team for a forum that, while it wasn't aimed specifically at incels, did attract a lot of the.  And a lot of the guys on the slow spectrum between the various phases of MGTOW, red pillers, incels and just plain lonely dudes.

My main impressions were:

* Holy fuck a lot of those guys were suffering from serious untreated mental health issues that we were not equipped to help them with and I really hope they all got the help we repeatedly encouraged them to seek out.
* Seriously we had so many this-person-is-in-a-suicidal-crisis moments we had hotline and crisis resource links permanently stickied and had to start maintaining a practice of immediately locking and/or deleting any post that mentioned suicidal ideation to protect the others.  
* Mod turnover in that place was fucking ridiculous.  Those guys needed way more help than we could give.
* Mostly average guys, some even good-looking, but convinced that the minor physical flaws they had were world-ending barriers to love and affection.
* A lot of self-sabotage.  No dating advice was ever followed no matter how simple.  There was always an excuse for why it wouldn't work or why they didn't feel they should have to do anything.
* What do they call it when you keep doing the same thing and expecting a different result?
* A large number of lonely people who had limited socialisation with women and had been raised to feel unable to seek emotional validation or support from men.  Therefore felt they NEEDED to pursue women (for sex, because they of course were expected to want lots of it and bought into that system a lot).
* Treated every IRL woman they met who wasn't old/related to them/fat as simultaneously their one chance for happiness AND unpaid therapy AND an untrustworthy harpy and then wondered why those women got scared off.
* Would spend month inventing elaborate fantasies convincing themselves a specific woman was the love of their life before they even introduced themselves to her, making any resulting rejection or even just *a lack of immediate reciprocation of these romantic fantasies* a massive, crushing blow to their ego that would set back weeks or months worth of self-improvement they'd been working on.
* So preoccupied with obtaining sex from women or with being convinced they could never do so that they never stopped to consider whether that was actually what they wanted (see the guys who would claim to have ZERO standards and then act insulted when you suggested a woman that was fat or older or not conventionally attractive).  
* I was so proud of the one guy who, through much self-reflection, realised he was really obsessing over the unattainability of sex-with-women so hard because he was desperately lonely for some non-toxic, friendly affection and companionship, and that he'd been sabotaging a lot of his efforts because HE WAS ACTUALLY ACE.  So fucking proud and happy for him.
* He didn't make up for the legions of guys who were just in it for pity-party.  Didn't actually want to change anything to meet women.  Held unreasonable standards for what they expected women to be for them but called women shallow for the standards *they imagined women applying to them*.  
* Personally insulted by the thought that women might be afraid of some men under some circumstances, or that women might value safety over the slim chance of a good encounter with the sullen sulky angry guy in the corner of the room mumbling about beta cucks
* A vocal minority would go all the way into resenting women for the imagined slights and rejections they never dared risk experiencing and would express sympathetic feelings towards the incel-goes-on-shooting-rampage people seen in the news, and the others would express sympathy with their viewpoint.  Another reason for the extremely high turnover of the majority-women mod team."
4,"Wearing heels. Fuck that, they're uncomfortable as fuck. "
5,"I became friends with a guy that I was genuinely interested in just being friends with. I had recently gotten out of a five year relationship and wasn't remotely ready to hop into another one.

Despite his friendly and polite demeanor, I kept getting the feeling that this guy had different intentions than I did. I wasn't quite sure what those intentions were, but something just felt off. I ended up shrugging it off in an optimistic attempt to only see the good in people.

Fast forward to us meeting up at a bar for drinks. I was in mid conversation when it hit me. My drink had been drugged. I didn't know how long I had before I completely lost my mental faculties, so I abruptly yelled, ""Period!"" and booked it to the bathroom to call a friend. 

Fortunately, I made it out of that situation unharmed, but I felt like an idiot for going against my gut feeling. Never again will I question it."
6,"95% of the time, women ""nagging"" men is just women asking men to be functional adults and do things for themselves."
7,"My mother taught me from a very early age to trust that instinct, even if it's ""impolite."" I tend to believe this has probably saved my ass a few times (nope, not going anywhere alone with you!) And destroyed a friendship. 
A few years ago a friend met a man online. The minute I met him I had that deep down instinct that this was a bad man. It wasn't until I saw him interact with children that I understood where that feeling came from. I mentioned pretty much every time I saw my friend that he behaved strangely around little girls; not inappropriately per say, but something was wrong. She brushed me off and told me how great he was with his nieces and her nieces and how he did a lot of babysitting for them. Our friendship disintegrated pretty quickly because I didn't want to be around him and insisted he shouldn't babysit. Sure enough, months after their wedding one of the girls told her mom he was molesting her. It eventually came out he had a history of molesting girls which his parents and ex wife knew about but covered up. "
8,"""I hope my daughter grows up to be like you"""
9,Was out at a bar with my friends and the guy one of them was trying to hook up with asked me why I hung out with my friends. Of course I said because I like them as people and we have a lot of fun together. His response was that i should find uglier friends to go out with because then I'd be the hot one of the group instead of the ugly one. He was a fucking gem.
10,My husband and I broke up once while we were dating. Just for a couple of months. Once we got back together I noticed he had all these lotions from the a hotel laying around (he travels a lot for work). Him not being a lotion kind of guy I asked him. He said they smelled like me. So he brought them home. 
11,"I'll preface by stating that my friends like to joke that I nurse my drinks. I take my time and enjoy them. So, if I do end up getting tipsy or drunk, it takes a while. Just my preference. 

Anyway, so I was nursing this beer (about 1/4 gone) when I started to feel nauseous. I thought it was strange, but figured dinner hadn't sat well or something. Not too long after that, I got jittery. Also strange, but meh. Then all of the sudden, I started feeling oddly euphoric, like I was having an OBE. Things looked, sounded and felt strange. 

The rest from there happened quickly. It was almost as if some ancient self-preservation mode kicked in and flashed DANGER in my mind. There was little time for thought at that moment, just action. When I made it to the bathroom, I recalled a few things that solidified my suspicion. 

As we were walking into the bar, he'd suggested I pick out seats while he grabbed the drinks. He also made multiple comments about how slowly I was drinking and even offered to get me another drink in case my slow pace was due to not liking the one I currently had. He seemed too eager for me to finish my drink.

At another point, I asked if he'd like to try my drink and he said with an odd smirk, ""If I did, I wouldn't be able to drive."" That didn't make sense to me because he was already drinking. A sip wouldn't have made a difference under normal circumstances.

The other odd bit is that when I recalled those things, they weren't solid memories despite having happened recently. They were more like flashes of a movie that I vaguely remembered.

I'm just thankful that I took my time and didn't gulp down the beer. I'm certain this story would have ended differently otherwise.  "
12,"After I gave birth to my daughter, my ex said he was traumatised by watching me, and that I'd ""ruined vaginas"" for him. He said that not only was me giving birth absolutely disgusting, but my labia were looser and darker now, and he'd look down and make a grossed out face. All in all he acted like HE was the one who needed to recover. 

But he still kept shoving his boners in my face trying to get a blowjob, because ""he had needs"". And tried to get me to do anal. 

If I have another kid, my partner is not going anywhere near that end during childbirth. "
13,"My youngest sister. Like our father before her, she is a sociopath. I am 100% certain if she thought she could get away with it, and would benefit from it, she would shiv someone. She wouldn't even hesitate.

Every now and again she'll broach the subject of playing human with me - I think she thinks deep down, I'm like she is. That deep down, EVERYONE is like they are, and pretending not to be. But I'm not, so when she asks ""aren't you tired of pretending to be sad?"" when we're at the funeral of a long-time family friend that died unexpectedly, for example, it just gives me the creeps.  She can laugh and cry on command, like when it's necessary for getting what she wants, but I'm really good at knowing when she's being fake.

She has gotten so much better at passing for normal the older we've gotten, but every now and again the mask slips, and you get a view of the calm, unemotional core underneath it all, and it's exactly like when she was little. It drives home how absolutely blank she is when she's NOT faking.  

She doesn't generally fake it if it's just the two of us, anymore. I know better, she knows I know better, there's no point. She's very candid about doing things to get what she wants, about manipulating people. She has the emotional range of a teaspoon. When she wants something from you, she's all sugar and sweetness, and it can be hard to remember that she's being fake, the charm is just an act.  

Even so, she's my sister, and I love her."
14,"This isn't a story about me but about my mom and her insane gut instinct that saved my life.

My mother was former law enforcement and has always been a ""rub some dirt on it and walk it off"" kind of parent when it came to illness and injury. I was always a drama queen so she went to the opposite extreme and just assumed everything was nothing. The only time that this seemed to change was once in college. 

I had called my mom to complain about slight stomach pain (not the first time since I basically ate garbage and survived off of soda and ramen) and she seemed really quiet about it. Near the end of the conversation she just says, ""if I pay for it, will you go to the emergency room and get it checked out?"" It was so out of character for her that I thought she was joking but she doubled down. She told me that she just had a bad feeling about it and thought it might be appendicitis or something. My mom is so unflappable and normally logical that it freaked me out enough to go to the hospital like she asked.

I get there and the doctors run some scans looking for appendicitis. Sure enough, they don't find any signs of appendicitis but they do see something odd on the scans and ask me to go see a different doctor and get it checked out. Go see another doctor and then another and results come back: it was cancer.

They caught it before I even started showing symptoms (that stomach pain was probably just bad eating) and so early that I didn't have to do any sort of radiation treatment and only had a minor surgery and I was in the clear. Even if it had become symptomatic, it still probably would have taken a while to get diagnosed because of my age and how rare it is for that to happen. If my mom hadn't been so shaken that day, who knows when they would have caught it."
15,"Not talking about money.  

I think it's fine to talk about how much things cost, salaries etc.  I'm not going to pressure anyone into telling me their salary, but I have no problems sharing mine.

Really, I think we should share this information more. "
16,"When my dog died, my dad told me not to be sad because ""he had a good life"". 

SHE had been my dog for 15 years. My dad had been corrected at least 25 times over the years that my dog is female. Yet still, always, my dad would say ""he"" when referring to her. 

My dad also always offers me coffee if I'm around him. I hate coffee. Always have. I have never consumed an entire cup of coffee in my whole life.
But he'll offer me a cup, and then get fake surprised every time, oh, you don't like coffee? Really? Since when? Since my entire existence. 
"
17,"When I was in high school there was this creepy older man who came in the restaurant every day. He really made me uncomfortable so I made sure to stay in the back when he was there. He even drove one of those big white vans that look like they're meant for abductions. One night I needed something from my truck and went to the parking lot to get it until I got closer to it and realized there was a big white van next to it, which was weird because it was in the back where employees parked and no one had a van. I was almost to my truck when I realized creepy guy was sitting in his van TWO HOURS after he'd left the restaurant. I noped it back to the building as fast as I could. Turns out he got arrested for having child pornography and trying to abduct a teenager. I'm always super aware of my surroundings now. "
18,"Facebook

* It's so damn slow 
* I hate the algorithm of friends' stories that it shows me
* The selection of trending news stories makes me hate humanity (and every time I see a celebrity's name I panic that they've died) 
* I hate that certain things come up in people's feeds, like when you comment on a company page (I commented on British Airways, and then my high school teacher liked it, great)
* The comments sections of articles are cancer, it seems Trump supporters appear everywhere just to say how much they hate the page they're commenting on
* Why does it show me every time a friend likes anything? I don't care. 
* The new ""reactions"" just annoy me because there are always angry faces on totally innocent articles 
* The search function is bollocks. You can bring up *all of* someone's public photos by using graph search (including ones they've hidden from their timeline), but you can't search by location or place of work... 
* Spam, bots, everywhere

I could go on! But it's the only way I can keep in touch with acquaintances and distant relatives, and post the occasional plea for advice or to advertise things. "
19,"I guess in some ways this is funny, but it really showed my date's shitty true colors. Once I was out on a first date with a guy, and we opted to get lunch at an artisanal deli nearby that did great sandwiches. The place is very popular and there's always a line, so to keep customers distracted from the wait employees at the different counters will offer samples of cheese and meat and such. 

Thus it occurs that one such employee came by and offered us samples of bacon. I of course took one (how can you say no to meat candy?) and ate it with relish, commenting to my date on the maple glaze flavor and how much I liked it. 

Finally we reach the counter, and I opt to order a caprese sandwich (tomatoes, mozzarella, basil), which is on the vegetarian portion of the menu. My date then turns to me in horror and mistrust and asks -

'You aren't a vegetarian are you?'

I just stared at him. He just saw me eat bacon, the least vegetarian food I can possibly imagine. It ran through my head that he must not have listened to a word I said, and also had some shitty attitudes about people with different dietary choices. And if food choice were this big of a deal other issues would be sure to follow. 

Finally I blurted out 'no'. 

He proceeded to prove all my suspicions right over the course of the night. 

There was no second date. "
20,"you mean your ex-boyfriend, right?"
21,"The vast majority of men I've ever met who complained about women ""nagging"" them were very lazy and didn't want to put in effort and/or do things when asked. 

Example:

Wife: Hey hun, can you do me a favor and rinse the milk cartons before putting them in recycling? They stink up the recycling bin.

Husband: Sure!

*-1 week later-* 

Wife: Hey, remember when I asked you to rinse the milk cartons? I noticed this one wasn't rinsed, can you please try to remember next time?

Husband: Yeah sorry, I forgot!

*-2 weeks later-*

Wife: The milk cartons...

Husband: I know, I know. Sorry.

*-3 weeks later-*

Wife: RINSE THE DAMN MILK CARTONS!

Husband: WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS NAGGING ME?!?!?!


**ETA:** This got way more attention than I thought it would and I'm getting messages about it, so I'm just clarifying that this is a completely made up problem based on the types of typically tiny and/or easy-to-solve problems I've heard people having this ""nagging"" issue over. 

My SO and I don't actually have this problem or any accusations of nagging, because when we ask each other to do things we either do it the first time, explain why we won't/can't/didn't, or compromise. Its not difficult for us. This example is based on my experiences, but not on my own personal relationship. Thanks."
22,"Years ago,  my friend had his cousin come for an extended visit. I was hanging out with this particular friend daily at this time,  so I ended up spending quite a bit of time with the cousin.  Immediately,  something just seemed off with the guy. I can't put my finger on it,  it was just a vibe.   He told me he was recently out of the military,  and his haircut and posture made that totally believable. He dressed well,  was friendly and polite,  and aside from a few awkward attempts at trying to flirt with me,  he was fine to hang out with.  As time went on, I could not shake this vibe.  He was just so creepy, but I couldn't figure out why.  About two weeks into his visit,  I randomly decided to look him up on the sex offender registry. There he was.  Further research lead to me learning that this sick fuck raped two young boys (both under ten years old) . He wasn't just out of the military,  he was just out of youth prison.  Because he was 17 when he committed the crime,  he got off with a 4 year rehabilitation program of some kind.  Obviously I was horrified and refused to be around him at all after that,  but I was a bit relieved that I wasn't crazy and my intuition was spot on."

28,"I see a lot of responses putting these on men not being functional equal partners in the household. I also see quite a few responses around women's often unequal share of emotional labor around managing a household. Both of these are true for some people. 

Another explanation could be media portrayal of the ""typical couple"". One trope that gets repeated quite often is the bumbling idiot of a husband and the overly motherly hot wife who for some magical reason stays with this man who doesn't do much for her except for the occasional episode where he almost loses her but gets her back with some minimal love gesture at the last second. 


I have met a handful of men who almost expected women to behave that way because this was what they were always told would happen as soon as they got into an adult relationship. Reinforced by clueless friends and family making jokes about how a husband's job is to say ""yes dear"" and remember, as soon as you get married, you will never be right, even when you are. Ah-fucking-ah. Great joke uncle George.... 

If you have no other frame of reference, sitcoms from the 80s will tell you what to believe, sadly."

30,"The dichotomy between women being expected to look good, but to also not talk about the effort that goes into that.

Fuck that noise. I take care of myself because I love to pamper myself, but I'm not going to pretend that it doesn't take time and effort. 

I mean, I just finished attacking my feet with a thing that reminds me most of a cheesegrater (no societal pressure there, having too much callus just hurts when I walk) and I'm not going to pretend that the way my feet look is natural. 

Pretending something is natural when it isn't hurts society in so many ways. It only creates people trying to achieve a goal they can never reach, or embarrassment for things that shouldn't be embarrassing ( I also just shaved my toes and plucked some stray long hairs from my breasts). 

It also leads to unrealistic expectations from men, or clueless guys who claim that they put so much more effort into looking good then girls do ('girls just need to show up and they have people falling over themselves to date them'). "

Neither of them knew what their own child's natural hair looked like after 23 goddamn years. "
33,"I got in a fight with my dad when I was a kid. Well, a lot of fights. But this one time in particular, he lashed out and said, ""You can't do (whatever it was I wanted), you're only 10!"" And I corrected him loudly because he traveled so much that he didn't know the age of his own kid. "
34,"A co-worker's cousin at a cook out. He had dead eyes and a weird vibe. He looked at everyone kind of weird, but the way he looked at women felt predatory. Any time I broke from conversations with others, he appeared.

He kept bringing up how people are touch-starved these days, especially men. I just kept saying, ""that's deep"" and would dart off to find someone to talk to. The fourth time he brought up men being touch-starved, he asked what guys should do and got way too close. I told him he should get out my face and go get a fucking 10-minute chair massage."

We have had talk about how many former partners we have had. It was easy to remember the number for me, just two guys before him. I told him that I was picky and that I needed emotional connection to have sex and that I happen to be monogamous in nature. Some months later we were still not exclusive due to the distance though it was exclusive on my part. One day he asks, ""Do you think about me when you fuck other guys?"" I don't know if it hurt more that he was OK with hearing about me maybe sleeping with other men, or that it was a question purely about his ego, or he didn't know me and actually could think someone who has had sex with just two men would sleep with another man when she was involved with someone *and* think about the other guy during sex."

50,"At one point I had it in my dating profile that I wouldn't date drug users (including recreational pot) or felons.

I got a lot of messages lecturing me about the benefits of marijuana and other narcotics, and accusing me of thinking that all felons are bad people.

I was getting a masters in criminal justice at the time and applying for careers in law enforcement/the federal justice system and just didn't want to date anyone who'd fuck up my background checks for work. Personally I support legalization and I understand the justice system enough to know that a felony charge in your past doesn't make you a bad person, but the federal government is pretty black and white about this shit."
51,"I called my two closest friends because my trust was shattered at that point, but since it was late on a weekday, they were happily snoozing with their phones on silent. 

I ended up leaving voicemails with terrible details because I didn't actually know where I was. I knew I was on WTF Ave, but I couldn't recall the name of the bar. That wasn't very helpful because there are a ton of bars on WTF Ave. 

Trying to communicate and figure out what to do while fighting those symptoms was a monumental task, so I ended up sitting in a stall for a while hoping that my brain would eventually get into gear. 

After a good 30ish minutes or so passed, I realized that my symptoms weren't getting any worse. They certainly weren't better, but I was conscious. At that point, I fought ridiculously hard to fully think about the situation and came to the conclusion that I didn't have many good options. I'd have to take a chance.

Feeling confident that I wasn't going to lose consciousness, I went back to the table and made an excuse about periods and period poops (the struggle is real with those). He looked nervous like he didn't quite buy it. 

He went from confident and slightly cocky to an unsure, stuttering ghost of himself. He ended up making a half-assed attempt at suggesting I finish my drink in some desperate last ditch effort to succeed, but I pushed the drink toward him and said, ""I'm not a fan of the taste, so you should have it. One more drink *shouldn't* hurt you, right?""

It was an intense stare down, but he eventually grabbed the drink and gulped it down. Right after, he gave a few reasons as to why we should call it a night. I stalled for as long as I could. I needed time for the drug to wear off and I wanted to see what would happen to him after he had that drink. 

Another hour or so passes and the bar is about to close, but by this time, he's a babbling, staggering mess. We get outside and he immediately starts crying. He told me a disjointed story about how once at a party years ago, a girl drugged him, raped him, and gave him herpes. He then started apologizing, but wouldn't tell me what he was apologizing about. 

I'll never know if that story was true, but my sympathy for him was obliterated by what he had just tried to do to me. I consoled him (part of me did genuinely feel bad for him thanks to my stupid, endless well of compassion), told him I had to get to bed because I had work in the morning, and took a detour to my car in case he decided to follow me.

I sat in my car for a while and waited for more of it to wear off. I didn't want to drive under the influence of whatever it was in my system. It took a while, but I eventually felt okay enough to drive. After taking a few detours just to be extra safe, I made it home, passed out, and felt like shit the next day. 

With all of that said, if you have a bad feeling about someone, don't take the gamble. I'm extremely lucky that night ended up the way it did. There were so many opportunities for it to have gone horribly wrong. 

Stay safe, everyone. "
52,"Well, just a few minutes ago..

I spent a few days taking care of my husband who had a bad cold... Annnd I caught it, the same week I have the most important interview of my life.

I asked him how the cold started, and explained  that I was getting sick. His response? ""Well, it's not *my fault*"". I spent five days taking care of him, and he can only snap at me for being sick and tell me to go to the doctor if ""it's that bad"". "

59,"I had been having a really rough time and talked to my friend about some really personal things -- about how I sometimes feel like a completely useless and incompetent person and how unhappy I was with myself.

We were all hanging out in voice chat and playing League one day and one of my friends say something like ""You're completely useless"". Now that honestly didn't bother me all that much because I knew he was joking and didn't really believe what he said. We insult each other all the time and out of all the girls, I usually get it the most because insults just bounce off me. 

But the friend who I had confided all these personal feelings of inadequacy (who usually partakes in teasing me as well) said flatly, ""No she's not."" I think it's because I'm so used to him making fun of me like the others that it really surprised me when he said it. It was just 3 words but I haven't forgotten them. "

Found out fairly recently that tons of fish products are made from fish caught by slaves - cat food, fish sauce, etc.  Even if you avoid the companies that directly buy their fish from those sources and buy fish or shrimp with a ""clean"" record, the fish *they* use as bait or to feed farmed fish or shrimp can come from slave ships.  There's just no way to tell for sure.

70,"I dated a guy I met online for two months. I went to visit him twice. The first time, I ignored how very little chemistry we had in person. I fought with myself and told myself I was shallow for not being attracted to him. We had gotten along so well for months and did all the typical staying-up-too-late-with-each-other nonsense and whatnot. I remember thinking we were on the same wavelength and we finished each others' sentences. And I had seen him over Skype (albeit he kept his room dark, clearly on purpose) so I ignored a lot of gut feelings. The second time I went to see him something was very off. I went from arguing with myself over whether or not I was attracted to him, to being anxious to go home. All I wanted to do was leave. I think he sensed something was off. I reassured him until I could safely leave and drive back home (two states away). I broke up with him via text shortly after. I didn't have the courage to tell this person I had done a complete 180 with that the truth was he gave me the creeps. I made the mistake of blaming it on remaining feelings for my ex. He blew up at me for my method of breaking up with him (although he asked me out via text, apparently breaking up with him via text was inappropriate), and how he thought I was different, blah blah blah. He went radio silence for a couple of weeks, but I didn't mind of course. I was relieved and started talking to another guy.  Then he came back thinking he would just wait til I got over my ex.  Nothing I could say after that would he believe. I tried to be nice at first, then I straight up told him in no uncertain terms what I really thought of him but he wasn't having it.

Well, I could retell the whole story of the build up in all of its disgusting detail, but honestly I hate reliving it, even in memories.  So, I'll cut to the chase: he started stalking me. At first it was just in-game (we met through a video game) where he would literally follow my character around.  Which of course, is not breaking any rules.  He didn't try to speak to me, which would have been against the rules, he just followed me. I couldn't go anywhere or play with my friends without him showing up. Then he started posting my pictures online with a link to my facebook, so I would get lots of random messages from strangers. He did it anonymously and through a proxy server. Some websites just removed what I asked them to (but I had to keep proving who I was, and they would never answer my questions, just respond ""this picture has been removed""), but one website had somebody who genuinely tried to help me. They wanted to ban his username and block his IP but all he had to do was create a new one and use proxy servers and they couldn't do anything.  So I paid a significant (to me at the time) amount of money to transfer my characters in the game to a different server. He created a new character (unbeknownst to me) and joined my guild on the new server and began talking to me.  He didn't give himself away so we talked but something about it seemed off.  The things he said were just a little too perfect, too tailored.  Finally, he gave himself away to the point that I was 100% sure who he was and I had a panic attack.  Reported him, but the mods couldn't do anything because my previous reports had not been taken seriously or documented properly so they, and I quote, ""couldn't prove this wasn't his first offense"".

At one point months before that, when I had argued with him and told him to fuck off, I mentioned that I was glad I never gave him my address. He informed that I had, I just didn't remember, and he still had it.  I literally had to tell my parents that if they ever saw a grey charger in the driveway, to call the cops.  Luckily I ended up moving 2000+ miles away a few months later and my parents retired and moved 1000+ miles away, too.  He somehow found out the town I live in now but he doesn't have my address so I feel safer, but I still don't use a real picture of myself as my Facebook profile picture and I don't play the game I used to love anymore. 

**tl;dr:** Dated a guy, got a bad feeling about him when I met him in person so I broke up with him... he ended up stalking me."
71,"i once accepted a ride from an older man when i was new in town, hopelessly lost, and couldn't find the grocery store. he seemed a little too keen but harmless, right up until he refused to just let me go shopping and came inside with me.

he insisted i had to get done so he could take me to his used-bike warehouse. i *needed* a bike and he wouldn't accept no for an answer. i was like ''oh sure well just write down the address and i'll come by!'' and he rolled his eyes and contemptuously said ''you couldn't even find the *shop*, good luck finding this! it's off google maps on a little path in the forest!''

i just suddenly knew there was something very Not Good and that i had to do something to avoid being taken to this possible murder shack. i was such a doormat, but i was so afraid that i politely screamed so loud that people would look and he would go away ''THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP I NEED TO GO NOW GOODBYE''. 

a really nice lady had noticed the look on my face and my tone, and heard the conversation and knew i was a foreign girl who was lost, so she told me to walk with her and she'd point me back to my dorm on the walk back to her place. 

it turns out, there was a dedicated ''perv gang'' in the student dorms for foreign students, that even the local paper had written about, and the much older men there loved to be super helpful to lost-looking girls."

76,"It wasn't dramatic or emotional, but the teacher that gave my high school graduation speech (each teacher would give a speech about 3-4 students). He didn't know me *at all*. He went on and on how I was going to live in Italy and study there, when all I was going to do was take a 2-week course italian just for funzies and would study art history afterwards, both in the same city as my high school.

It's quite funny looking back on it because he was *so* off, but in hindsight it would've been nicer if a teacher that actually knew me gave the speech."
77,"This is a long and cringe heavy tale so don't say I didn't warn you. 

I met this guy at a comic book convention and we'd hit it off a bit. Later he messages me and we decide to go on a date. I suggest a couple places - including the deli in the story - and he said they all looked good (this is important as later he claimed they were too expensive). We meet at the deli, and from the bacon!fail on, shit just got worse and worse. Here's the run down:

I always offer to go Dutch on first dates since it feels presumptuous to do otherwise. He acted like I was emasculating him by suggesting it, then when we reached the cash register he basically panicked because he felt the food was too expensive. So we went Dutch anyway with me picking up some of his monetary slack to boot. 

While we sat and ate our sandwiches a man passing by complimented my looks (I was done up to the nines in a Mad Men style dress). My date responded by grabbing my hand aggressively and told me he didn't like sharing and would totally fight that guy if he did it again. I knew then this wasn't going to be a repeat event but thought I might be able to salvage us having some small good time together. 

We went to the bookstore which I thought he might find interesting. He sulked. We went to my favorite comic book store, which has a huge selection of tabletop games and sweet collectibles and is basically nerd heaven. I was sure he'd like it. He sulked. At this point I was edging towards 'fuck him, I'm going to have fun anyway' territory. I buy what I wanted (Hellboy: The Crooked Man &amp; Others) and we leave. 

There on the sidewalk he gives me a dressing down about how I'm horribly high maintenance and we should have gone where he wanted and I was a terrible person for spending money like I did and I needed to adjust my expectations and learn to let him take the lead because he knew better than I did and I shouldn't have worn that dress men were staring at me and he didn't like other men looking at his date. 

Alright 'fuck you I'm done with your lame ass' mode has officially engaged. I turn on my heel and walk to my favorite bar in the area. My fish-witted fuck of a date follows me there despite my clear indication that he can go home and that this bar was far too 'high maintenance' for him to get any enjoyment out of it. I sit down at the bar and order a martini. Fish-wit sits next to me, orders a beer, and kept talking to me. I just stared at him with the flattest, least amused facial expression I have in my arsenal. Dude doesn't get it. Keeps talking. Criticizes me for drinking hard liquor and insinuates that he doesn't approve of one drink but two would be terrible. 

He goes to the bathroom. I order another martini because fuck him. Bartender has definitely clued in that this is a disaster date, makes sympathetic noises to me as he serves me and says if I need an help with fish-wit, just ask him and he'll get the manager. 

Fish-wit comes back. Muted outrage over my second martini. I stare balefully at the bartender in full 'look what I have to put up with' mode. Finish my martini, pay. Fish-wit decides the cost of his beer is too high and tries to haggle the price with the bartender, who is having none of it. We leave. There on the sidewalk he asks when the next date will be and if next Saturday works for me. 

I wheel on him and inform him in my coldest, flattest tones that we were clearly incompatible and there wasn't going to be a second date. Threw in a couple acidic lines about how 'high maintenance' I was and how it made me unsuitable for him. He was totally taken aback, tried to apologize. I shut him down and left him standing there on the sidewalk. 

As I'd had two martinis I had no intention of driving so I made my way to a local tea house/bookstore where I sobered up over several cups of Earl Grey and a book about mushroom hunting. Went home eventually and regaled my friends with the tale. 

Next day got an IM - remember those? - from Fish-wit, asking for another chance. Told him no, blocked him, and that's the end of the tale.

then after months of acting like a bonafide partner, they get to drop you like a hot potato when another option comes along, say ''well, you missed the fine print where i *said* i didn't want anything serious, nevermind my consistent actions to the contrary for months after that'', delivered with a transparent display of shock and surprise that you ever *got* such an idea!

81,"Not too long ago I had to take blood from a patient, I just saw him from behind walking to his room and instantly something in me said ""NOPE."". I went to one of the male nurses and asked him to accompany me to the patient's room, he was a little confused but did as I asked. Turns out that patient was just in our part of the hospital for one scan, he is usually in the psychiatric ward and has molested children and had attempted to rape a caretaker about 30 years (?) ago. He is usually only cared for by male nurses or at least while there is someone male present, since he does not seem to respect women as human beings at all.

84,"Yes - I had a professor in school who I worshiped. I TAed for them for three semesters, did an independent study with them, and relied on their opinion about everything. We were so close, the students I TAed for thought of us as a single unit. (It helped that our names happened to rhyme.) After school, this professor even sent me an $150 check to fund an independent project. 

A couple years later, this professor approached me looking for an assistant for their own project. They could only pay a nominal stipend of $50 a month. That was fine with me because it was only supposed to be a couple hours a week, and their project sounded fun. As the months went on, the ""stipend"" disappeared (I only ever got it twice in 10 months) but I kept working out of sheer loyalty and didn't mention it. Eventually this professor became obsessive about the project and started send me upwards of 10 text messages a day, demanding work with deadlines of the next morning - while I still wasn't being paid at all. Instead of it being 10 hours a month, it was more like 10 hours a week - which I didn't have to give. I was often sacrificing sleep and working on the project between 1 and 3 AM. If my mentor wasn't happy with the results, they'd make me redo the work multiple times.

I did this for 10 months and by that time I was pretty much burnt out. When I tried to scale back, they wouldn't ""let"" me and kept emailing me assignments anyway. The moment I told them I had to wind it down for good, they became very frosty toward me and removed me from all accounts immediately (like within 5 minutes). I've never had a close relationship with that professor again and that saddens me, but I also don't feel like our working relationship was healthy by the end. So I have no regrets."

I didn't realize my experiences were atypical until I compared notes with more attractive friends and began noticing certain trends: Men approached them whereas I did most of the approaching. Men initiated first kisses and sex with them whereas I was usually the one to get the ball rolling there, too. They'd tell me about compliments they'd received about their faces and bodies, and I'd realize I'd never heard anything like that from anyone I'd been with. Overall, they described men making a level of effort with them that nobody ever made with me.

Also, occasionally you'll have the experience of a guy who knows you both approaching and talking animatedly to your friend without even acknowledging you're there. That's always super fun."

This hits home.  One of my closest friends is a tall fat woman,  I'm a very petite woman.  Throughout our twenties,  people (especially men) would always remember me,  but never her even though we were always together.  Luckily,  she's no shrinking violet and would insert herself into the conversation ""Hi I'm Emily.  We met at Matt's party and again at the coffee shop"". Basically calling them out for ignoring her. People often referred to her as ""(my name) 's friend"". She didn't stand for that shit. She'd say ""ya I'm friends with ---- but I actually also have a name"".  My now decades long friendship with her has really opened my eyes to how fat women are treated.  It's extremely depressing.

She's an alcoholic and a drug addict, a compulsive liar and a master manipulator.  There is nothing she can add to my life.  15 years ago, she abandoned her biracial daughter so she could marry a white supremacist and my parents later adopted her daughter.  

Even if I had some hint that my sister has changed, my niece has gone through so much shit in life, and I would absolutely wait for her to want her mother back in her life before I made any overtures at all.  If my sister changed completely and begged for forgiveness, and my niece said ""I'm not ready for this,"" then I'm not ready for it, either.

&gt;As a husband and father I am beginning to be repulsed a bit by vaginas... Please don't get me wrong, when I'm all horny and shit there is no better place to be than in a nice warm Vag... but when I am not horny.... different story. After spending mass amounts of time with my wife (who I love and adore) I have learned so much about vaginas. I used to see them as a delicate, inviting flower... so mysterious... so beautiful. Now... after the countless periods, the birth of my son, the fluids, the smells, the trash can beside the toilet... I have realized that those things can be pretty disgusting. I am so glad to have a penis. I pee... I ejaculate... I occasionally pull out the number 3 attachment on my shaver and trim the bushes... that's it. No mess, no worry.

111,"This sounds a bit silly, but a few years ago, I was feeling down on myself and how I looked (one of my bad habits that I'm trying to snap out of) when my boyfriend said, ""You're pretty like a flower. A daisy, and daisies are the best flowers.""

114,"I wonder sometimes if that's what my father is.

When he was fooling around texting some waitress at the bar he frequented and my mom found out, obviously it was a big ordeal.  They would have not-quiet conversations about it, and one time he came home pretty inebriated so he was especially loud.  I was too old (college) to really care that much about the outcome.  My dad is not really a nice person, but my mom is Catholic so it's against her faith to leave him.  She wanted to, though.  I told her to get the hell out of Dodge but she didn't.  She forgave him in the end.

However, something he said that one night really struck me.  When he was trying to explain why he was doing what he was doing (instead of apologizing, mind you) and he said ""I live my life for me. Everyone lives their life for them.  That little girl upstairs?  She lives her life for her.  So maybe you're the weird one if you live your life for us.""  It was difficult for me to remain silent at the top of the stairs listening to this.  But I did pack my bags and move 2200 miles away and left her alone with him.  So maybe he's right."
115,"Well within the first week I will find some way to be ""cold"".  If it isn't winter or at least chilly outside, then it could be a particularly chilly restaurant or movie theater.

But this early on, it will be too obvious, so I always give it back.

Repeat this a couple more times over the next couple weeks and add in a couple key lines ""oh it smells good."" or ""you're so sweet always letting me borrow this""

At some point, the agitation sits in and they begin to tell me to bring my own jacket.  I have to say something to the effect of, ""they don't make womens jackets/hoodies like they do mens""

Then after about a month I ""forget"" to give it back

I text them to let them know I will return it but immediately turn the conversation into sexting so they forget about it.

""Forget"" to return it for a few more weeks.

Wear it when I go out with them.

""Hey that's my jacket/hoodie!""

""I know but it looks better on me."" ;)

At some point about 3-4 months in, they just accept it."

118,"* As a fat lady, I've experienced a fairly good number of men who were attracted to me, both romantically and sexually, but wouldn't date me because they were too embarrassed or self-hating to introduce me to others.
* Going shopping with your thinner friends can be anywhere between super-boring and a nightmare. It's so annoying to *have* to spend your time in the 95% of stores that *don't carry anything your size* and you have to pretend to be cool watching your friend try on stuff, or looking at the fucking scarves.
* I've had plenty of men try to separate me from my ""hot"" friend, with a ""wingman"" or as I call them ""the distracting asshole."" This has literally never succeeded."
119,"Told me that the method I'd used to complete a piece of maths coursework was ""very elegant"".

121,"I was in elementary school and a girl in my Girl Scout troop was having a sleepover. I went over and everything was fine but I was painfully shy so generally I didn't like talking to adults. When it was time for us to change into pajamas, her parents said some could change in the bathroom, bedrooms, etc. her dad told me I could change in one room, I don't even remember which one. The second he looked at me and said that I got a really bad feeling of absolute dread. I went in the room and changed as fast as I possibly could, hunched over and facing away from the door. 

Shortly after that, we moved away but I found out a few years later that he had been molesting another girl in our troop that was closer friends with his daughter. "
122,"I told my dad I only ever wanted to make him proud of me.

123,"It was pretty dark and I turned on my phone which was really bright lighting up my face. The guy beside me was like, 'woah, cool! You have a mustache"" . He was 9. I actually died of laughter and it was even cuter because he was trying to compliment me. Although it was an insult I still thank him because I told my mum the story and then she finally agreed that it was maybe time to start removing hair there. "
124,"How much horrific casual sexism there is on nearly every popular reddit thread.

I just can't deal with the fallout because it's hyper-important to many redditors that there's no such thing as sexism, or their sexism is fine, or I just can't take a joke, or I'm a frigid feminazi, or etc forever."
125,"She's not immediately creepy, but there's a woman who comes into the store I manage. Each and every time she comes in, she seeks me out, and asks if she can wear my glasses while she shops. 

There's another woman who left the store angry when I couldn't properly match a lip colour to my own natural lip colour. She still talks about how perfect the shade of my lips are. 

Both women are endlessly creepy to me.  "
126,"To a lot of people I probably am. My hobbies are pretty solitary, I like to spend a lot of my down time doing quiet activities, and I tend to avoid really loud or crowded places or events. I definitely don't live an instagram-exciting life.

132,"When I first met my ex, I had a chilling feeling about him. I was scared of him. I thought I was being foolish because he did everything in the rom coms and was super romantic so I dated him. He sexually assaulted me and other women afterwards. I should have listened to my gut feeling. "

135,"I really enjoyed it! It was a spur of the moment decision one day. My hair is really curly, and it was so dry and dead so I figured ""Let's start brand new!"". My boyfriend at the time gladly shaved my head for me :)

It was really easy upkeep and the growing out process was fun because I got to experiment with the different length stages and try new and crazy things I've never had to chance to do before. I'm glad I did it, and maybe I'll do it again one day but who knows. 

One weird thing I found about having a shaved head was that I wore more makeup. Maybe psychologically I wanted to feel very feminine still? Maybe I tied my femininity to my hair? I don't know!"
136,"Yes! There was actually a wardrobe lecture in my orientation for the type of work I'm in (articling student), and women were instructed to buy three pants for each suit so they can be hemmed to each heel length properly. Fuck that, do you know how expensive suit pants are?! I'm not buying three times as much as a guy just to wear uncomfortable shoes.

Heels hurt my back and my feet. They're awkward to run around in, especially if I have to go up and down stairs. They're cute, but they're so not worth it."
137,"Playing games with men. I've never done it, and I don't really know how to. 

I've never followed that 'Wait-X-Dates-Before-You-Fuck' rule, which always seemed a bit archaic like men are the only people who want to fuck and it's women's job to be a gatekeeper? 

But also that 'wait for him to text you' and 'wait for him to ask YOU out on a second date' never appealed to me, but it may also come across as creepy to dudes who are so into those societal expectations already. Iunno"
138,"My old co worker. Even though he seemed nice, there was something insidious about him. Sure, some colleagues just thought he was sad: No SO, no kids, no friends, 300+ lbs, middle aged, ugly, had to leave his job as a paramedic, and lived alone. Not that any of those qualities automatically insinuates that someone lives a externally imposed solitary and celibate life but he just reeked of despair. 

My colleagues thought I was an asshole for not liking him. And I didn't care. There was just something...off about him. I used to say that I believed he was a child molester or something. I was called, ""dramatic,"" amongst other things. 

One year later, he stops showing up. Turns out, he was indicted on federal charges for owning the largest collection of child porn in Illinois history. The oldest child in his collection was 9 or 10. The youngest? An infant. All involved rape, molestation, torture, and fucking bestiality. He's only sentenced for 5 years, believe it or not.

If I ever had a reason to not trust my gut, I think back to that asshole. Hope he burns in hell."
139,"In the past, waking up from wisdom teeth removal and *very loudly* in a *very silent* waiting room asking ""are you still gonna dick me later even though I look like a chipmunk?"" He was so mad at me. For like a week straight. And I was sooooooo embarrassed when he told me about it. Like very red cheek embarrassed. "
140,"The retroactive expectation of monogamy that a lot of guys seem to have when they get into a serious relationship. I have seen a massive amount of posts in various relationship subreddits where guys are saying, ""I found out that my girlfriend had a one night stand with someone a couple of nights after I first met her and we weren't dating! Should I ever trust her again?!"" 

I have even seen guys admitting that they were dating multiple girls at once at the same time complain about their girlfriend having hooked up with someone. "
141,"I've shared this before, but it was a guy who was admitted to the psych hospital for suicidal ideation.  That's what he said anyway.  He pushed boundaries and asked for too much that was always just a little beyond acceptable.  

He tried some crocodile tears on me to get me to let him use my phone, but when I insisted he use the client phone, his facade fell away for a second and he looked at me with black shark eyes that communicated he'd snap neck if there wasn't a tech around the corner. He was the first sociopath I'd met.  It was pretty chilling."
142,"Womens' ""behavior"" while PMSing or on their period.

(He cheated on me three times total).

""Your insecurities are SUCH a turn off.  I get that I cheated on you but get over it.  When you're insecure, it's super inconvenient.""

And, my personal favorite:

""You can't be upset about my cheating  or tell me I can't be friends with her.  It happened two years ago and that's controlling behavior!  Besides, your jealousy is an unevolved, Neanderthal emotion and you need to get it under control.""

Edit: A word."
145,"There was that one time during Passover when I acted like the Holocaust was basically just a lousy summer camp...oh wait...no...

For real though it was probably when I was assigned a report on whaling in like 7th grade and broke down sobbing in the middle of it because I was PMSimg for the first time and couldn't think of anything other than the poor dead whales and how they had families and stuff. 

"
146,"I could smell strange things. Like I'd be sitting on the couch reading a book and suddenly smell electricity. It's hard to explain, but there's a certain scent that is emitted from live power points, a lamp that's switched on or a surround sound speaker for example. Also other smells I couldn't identify and would go around my house like a crazy woman trying to find the source. I would always buy a pregnancy test if I could smell the TV running lol

Plus I was exhausted and would cry at toilet paper commercials. "

**Me:** Is that on purpose?

**SO:** Little bit.

Then he grins like he's just gotten away with something. It's definitely stupid, but it's *our* stupid thing. "

150,"We lived together for about 5 years before marriage.  So, no.  Our dynamics didn't change except that he loses his ring in the couch all the time because he plays with it and it pisses me off, lol.  

We were already committed before - marriage was more of a symbol of our commitment and we could have government benefits coming from our legal union."
151,"There was this boy in my second grade class who I always thought was nice, nice for a boy, most boys back then just teased me. I could tell my parents didn't want me around him though, but they wouldn't say why. A few times he showed me this knife he would bring to school, once he told me he stabbed someone with it. I didn't believe it when he told me that. I just thought he was trying to scare me more than goosebumps. Then one day he just disappeared from school. I pestered my parents enough that they eventually told me how he had been sent to a place for the criminally insane. He had threatened to stab our teacher, and had left drawings of how he would stab her in her mailbox. He later admitted to killing a bunch of cats, mine included. His mom mailed us the collar back. "

156,"Well I guess next time he gets sick, he can just go to the doctors instead of having you take care of him, right?"
157,"""you haven't changed a bit, sorry for the new guy"" based on a few text messages after he had sent me unsolicited attacking messages.

158,"Gas. Aside from the environmental factor, I hate having to go to the gas station and fill up (which, I will readily admit, is a first world problem). 

Currently I'm not in a position to be able to purchase a different vehicle, like a hybrid car or an electric car. I also don't live in walking or biking distance of pretty much anything, and my area lacks a well-developed public transit system.

159,"When they speak in this sort of condescending/eye-rolling/demeaning way about their wife* or children for acting in a demographically-appropriate way.  (e.g. complaining about their wife acting feminine or acting like a spouse, or complaining about their children acting their age or expecting parental care from their parents.)

I've observed a strong correlation between making these complaints in the presence of other men and treating women poorly when there are no other men around.

*I say ""wife"" instead of ""spouse"" because I've never heard men making these kinds of complaints about their husbands."
160,"actually, about a full year before we started dating and we were still just friends, BUT, in my defense he let me wear it hanging out one night because it got cold, and when i tried to hand it back he was like, ""nah hang on to it."" so then a year later, he said, ""It should be a rule if someone has an item of your clothing for longer than 6 months you're required to date them""

I don't know how many patients I've had over the years where you would look at them and say ""I just can't put my finger on it, but this guy isn't right"". So you call the Dr. and try to articulate your gut feeling. Good Docs know that nurses' ""gut feelings"" are usually predictive of something. 

I had a patient once in for a bowel obstruction, but blood sugar was going up, so they shipped them up to me for DKA protocol (don't ask - doesn't even make sense to me). I took one look at them and knew something wasn't right despite vital signs and assessments being ""normal"". I called all the docs that were supposed to be looking after the case, but all were mysteriously not answering phones, so I called the ER to say ""this patient isn't right. I can't find anyone but they need to be looked at right now"". Volvulus obstructing the inferior vena cava. If they had sat on them like they were trying to, the patient would be dead now. 

Gut feelings are so, so important!"

166,"A few years ago I was a live-in nanny who took care of 3 young boys. The boys are my cousins and their mom lives in the house as well. Anyway, my cousin's Grandpa would stay in the downstairs basement every few days because he owned the house. I've known this man for 10 years and he has hardly spoken a word to me, a man of few words. I've always felt a strange vibe around him. About two weeks into living there he approaches me in the middle of the night while I'm studying for my college courses. With a bottle of wine in his hand he says ""meet me downstairs for some quality time"" That's all he said, and with that he walked downstairs. This was incredibly unsettling because it was the first sentence he had spoken to me in 10 years, and the creepiness was magnified because he chose to approach me at 2am while everyone in the house was sleeping. This all sounds very innocent at facevalue but something in my gut told me to stay away from this man, I packed my bags the very next day and moved back into my mom's place. A few weeks later I told my mom's best friend about what happened because I was unsure if I was being over-dramatic. She then told me that while she was a teenager this same man used the same line on her when they were both alone in the very same house, but she actually went downstairs to spend 'quality time' with him. She told me that he beat her and sexually assaulted her to take out the frustration he had for his wife, but no one in the family believed her when she told them it happened. I believe her, he was having problems with his wife when he invited me downstairs in the middle of the night. I honestly think I avoided a really shitty situation. Always follow your gut.."
167,"Probably not the rudest ever, but it stands out in my memory. I can't remember how this topic came up, but this exchange happened in my first week of college as we were all hanging out and getting to know each other:

Him: I did that for my Eagle Scout project.

Me: Oh, cool! I did the Gold Award!

Him: No one cares about the Gold Award.

For context, I'm a lifetime member of Girl Scouts, and the source of my endless frustration is the sexism in people's perception and awareness of Girl Scouts vs. Boy Scouts. It runs *deep.* He's completely right. Almost everyone knows what Eagle Scouts is, but I have to explain the Gold Award whenever it comes up, even though it's virtually the same thing. They're practically seen as ROTC by the public, and we're seen as a crafting club. "
168,"Super sore boobies. Like felt heavy and sore. 

And I didn't notice this, but my husband did, I went craaazy over apple juice, which I barely drink. After I bought 10 cause they were 99 cents each and I wanted some he was like '... yknow last time you were this into apple juice you were pregnant..' this time. THEN I noticed the sore boobs the next day and was like 'fuuck'

This went down like a week before my period was due. With #1 my boobs were sore a week after my period was due."

How would you want her to behave?* I find that this line of thinking has made me a very successful person (at least in my eyes) and it makes my parents proud of me as well :)"
171,I got out of the shower and my cat started licking my feet. The only other time she had ever done that was when I was pregnant before. I had not even missed my period yet. She knew before any of us!
172,"Don't settle. You deserve someone who loves, respects, and cares about you. Do not waste your time on anything less. "
173,"Yes. I was dating a guy recently and from the first time we had sex I had a feeling he was hiding something. But I had known him for 6 months. I was pretty close with him, trusted him very much, and he always had an explanation that made sense. But I still had a funny feeling that I wasn't getting the whole truth. I tried to break it off a couple times but he always found a way back into my life (and my bed) for 3 months. I knew we weren't exclusive but I just felt like there was something more sinister happening. 

Turns out he didn't live 30 mins drive away with his sister, he lives maybe a 15 minute walk from my house with his girlfriend of 2 years. He has an 8 year old from a previous relationship and owes a LOT in child support back-payments so she pays for everything. He was driving me around in her car. Any drink or concert ticket he bought me was on her dime. He was leaving my bed and going straight to hers. He bought her a promise ring in December when we were fucking the most.  He's a habitual cheater and cheated on all his exes multiple times and actually carried on a second relationship for NINE MONTHS while still dating his current gf. She and I talked for 2 days which is how I found all this out. I told her everything but as far as I know they stayed together. "
174,"Taylor Swift. I still hold a special place in my heart for her music, but I really started losing respect for her when it was revealed she lied about the whole Kanye thing to make herself into the victim. 

She was all about feminism, girl power, etc. too during her 1989 days, but then drops off the face of the Earth when it comes time to stand up for those issues. You can argue that it could've jeopardized her career, but plenty of celebrities stand up for causes like that and still do fine - I think she's just kind of cowardly and paranoid about looking bad in the media. "
175,"I don't like them and would never get one, but whatever. No other feelings.

176,"You sound grounded and like someone that would be an awesome friend AND parent. My folks, who have 7 kids, are like that, too, and now that I'm grown, I'm profoundly grateful that they understand the whole ""put on your own mask before assisting others"" approach that they took. After 35 years, they're still happy and in love, and I think that's a big reason why.

It can be difficult to watch friends seem to lose all the things, aside from motherhood (I would say parenthood, but it's far less common with men, IME), that make them, them"

""Okay sweetie just ask!""

Then it starts with 

""Hey can you do the cat litter for me?""

""Yeah, I'll do it in a bit"" 

Then they'll forget. And we'll think ""Well, did they forget or are they just taking a while to do it?"" Time will pass and it still isn't done, so you'll let them know they didn't do it and it's been a while.

They say ""Oh sorry! You should have reminded me"". 

So in the future, you start reminding them. Then they start responding with, ""sure I'll do it after this thing I'm in the middle of."" So then you notice it's been 3 hours since they finished the thing they were in the middle of, so you ask them again. ""Hey can you do the cat litter now?"". Eventually it gets to the point they go ""It's so late I'm so tired, can I just do it tomorrow? I promise I'll do it tomorrow"" and it repeats.

If we don't ""nag"" about a chore, it won't get done for days upon days. If they just did it right away and stopped putting it off like that, we wouldn't have to nag."

182,"When I was 13/14 or so this older man (in his 40s) at our family church kept wanting to talk to me. He would sit behind me in the pews and lean up to whisper in my ears throughout the sermon, and always made sure he was next to me when it was time to hug your neighbors. I was polite to him because it's how I was raised and plus, he was a fellow church member and everything was happening in front of everyone and none of the adults had said anything about it, so I figured he was just lonely and wanted company. 

I can't for the life of me remember how he got my email address, I think it was printed in one of the info papers for a youth trip, but he started emailing me all kinds of crazy propositions out of the blue. I was the most beautiful creature he had ever seen, he was lustful for me, he wanted to marry me, etc etc etc. (Not that this really matters much but just to paint a fuller picture, I was not a very ""developed"" teenager, especially in the early years. There wasn't a chance in hell that he mistook me for an adult or even an older teen.) I was thoroughly creeped out and showed my parents the emails. My dad had a ""long talk"" with the man and essentially told him to never come near me or speak to me again. The man begged my dad to let him marry me. Swore he would wait for me to turn 18 and that he would stay chaste until he could fully give himself to me on our wedding night. Cried when my dad said no. 

I left the church for different reasons a few months after that, and then my family ended up moving states a couple years later. I'm 25 now, so this all happened over a decade ago. Guess who just friend requested me on Facebook..."

The day before Valentine's Day I took two pregnancy tests that came back positive. He was very supportive and 'said' all the right things. Booked the termination date. 

We had a perfect Valentine's Day evening and skip forward to the day after, I had a hockey match and felt pretty tired and stressed after so stayed in that night instead of going out. I didn't want to pressure him into staying with me so made it clear it was his choice whether to be with me or go out.

He went out. I couldn't sleep, had a horrible feeling. 

I messaged him in the middle of the night and he's confused, claiming I woke him. I left it.

The next morning I find out he took a girl back to his place and fucked her. "

I tend to find that people that drop this line have more drama circling them than people who never mention it. "
192,"Things changed a little. It was very subtle. A lot of it was how other people treated us. After we got married, it was expected that his guy friends would invite me to their shindigs, or run their plans past me when they took him out. This was his friend's expectation, not ours. There was a subtle intangible respect for our relationship amongst all his friends and family. His friends began to view my problems as his problems, and offered to help as they would have helped him. When my dance club got it's speakers locked up with the keys states away an hour before the dance, one of his friends offered his professional sound system. His family expects him to prioritize me over them. It's just a lot of small things that add up to being family."

194,"One of my gripes is that older people find it acceptable to comment on people's youth in a condescending way. I was brought up to know its rude to comment on people's ages. What I don't get is when older people say things like ""you look too young to be married"" because that's essentially telling me I look like a child. It's also them saying that they don't take me seriously as an adult. As someone in my early mid twenties, I don't appreciate being told I'm too young to be making my own decisions, too young to have a career.. it's not a compliment. I appreciate that I look young but I recently had someone tell me that I ""look about twelve"". Being told you look twenty five when you're thirty five is a compliment. Being told you look pre-pubescent when you're an adult is an insult, especially when it is that absurd an age. I don't get why people say things like that. It's just as rude as telling someone they look too old to be working. "
195,"I'm getting really sick of my dad trying to suggest men for me to date. I came out as gay 2 years ago. He won't say the word gay, he says ""now that you *prefer women*"", and is in total denial that men are no longer a possibility.

I met so many guys who would act like I should drop everything to come shag them when they call or give them a place to crash when they need one, but the minute I called THEM to ask for sex or whatever, I'm being clingy. I found such a double standard in their expectations, namely that their time line for a relationship was way more valid than mine, to them.

Anyway, I had a young man I didn't know (around my age) come to the business I work for and sexually harass me. What freaked me out was him refusing to leave when I asked. I was alone in the building at the time, which made the situation higher-stakes in my thoughts. So, I yelled at him, got angry, and kept yelling at him/ acting dominant to make him leave. He eventually did leave, and my gut urged me to report this guy to police ASAP. They came and I filed a complaint, and they found/ cited him a few days later.

Last month, he was arrested for a brutal murder.  He allegedly killed an older man (who was a complete stranger to him) exactly one week after my interaction with him. My report helped police identify the murder suspect from security camera images."

All career women are just ball busting feminists who want to ruin America. He's just awful. 

I met his ex-girlfriend (not baby mama) after they had broken up and who he treated really shitty. She was a lot of fun and we hung out a few times. However, she still carries a huge torch for him.

211,"Yep, I still see so many people in my life running on this paradigm and it's really an issue now that women are decades into working full-time jobs/pursuing traditionally ""male"" activities, and instead of expecting that all household labour will be split more evenly, there's this assumption that men are dumb Homer Simpsons who can't change a baby or do the dishes or send a thank-you note and women are all SuperMoms who make it all work and get adorably frustrated but are still ready to don that lacy nightie when everything's in order. It's family, it's cleaning supply and food commercials, it's magazines, it's TV, it's stand-up comedy. You'd think it was still 1985 the way most media portrays household dynamics. "

215,"I went by myself to New Orleans -- I was meeting some friends from college to attend a football game at the Superdome. (Pre-Katrina -- anyone from anywhere near the area will wonder.) I'd found a decent hotel on Canal Street and could see that it was six blocks to the French Quarter where my friends were staying. I arrived at the hotel about an hour before checkin, so I was going to just leave my bags with the concierge and check in later. 

So there was this group of what appeared to be college kids, and they had one of those cart thingies and were loading up all their stuff -- doing the same thing I was, leaving their bags with the concierge. It was a pretty large group so I sat down to patiently wait my turn and just people watched. Boy, was that ever a great idea. 

At first, I'm just watching the group of college kids, chuckling to myself because I've done road trips with college buddies and there's always one woman who appoints herself The Organizer®, so she was making sure everyone had what they needed and they'd appropriated sufficient beers for the next couple hours. So I'm watching this woman Organize All The Things, and my attention wanders off. I spot this guy who looked to me what I thought a Cajun must look like. I observed him for a while; he was just hanging around in the lobby and didn't seem to be with anyone or particularly interested in doing anything like checking in or leaving his bags with concierge. Because he had no bags. Just a dude wandering around the lobby. 

It was raining that day, and by the time I got my bag checked, I realized I'd left my umbrella in the car, which was valet parked. I didn't want to ask for my car to be brought around just to get my umbrella out of it, so I decided to find a Walgreens and pick up another one. 

I start walking down Canal St. and just as I was about to duck into the Walgreens a couple blocks away, I spotted Cajun Guy, walking behind me. Hmm... that's weird, I thought. And that's when my Spidey Sense pinged into the red. 

I take my time in Walgreens and when I stepped back out on the sidewalk, I took my sweet time opening the umbrella so I could look around a bit more*. Sure enough, there's Cajun Guy hanging out in some doorway to some store just down the block. I walk a few steps to the cross walk, turn and look behind me, and he's there, just a few steps behind me. 

I cross Canal St., which has about four lanes plus a trolly track in the middle, so it's pretty wide. I stop at the opposite corner and look back and see Cajun Guy standing there. I make eye contact, point right at him, and then turn and walk on down Canal St. A couple blocks later, I found the street in the French Quarter, and my friends' hotel was only about a block in, and I quickly connected with them and all was well. I told them what happened and they wouldn't let me walk by myself -- they'd hail a cab for me whenever it was time for me to go back to my room. 

* I learned this technique from my mom. We were in the Bahamas once and she thought someone was following us, so she told me to stop. She said it pretty forcefully, which is SO not like my mom, so I did and then had to be all ""WTF is going on?"" She instructed me, if anyone is ever following you, they don't want a mark that will fight back. They want an easy target and the easiest targets are people who are completely unaware of their surroundings and haven't noticed WHO is around them. She said to stop and make eye contact so the person following you understands that you have noticed them and can now make a positive ID to the cops, should things go all pear-shaped. I thought she was completely full of shit and was just being paranoid about being followed in the Bahamas until I spotted Cajun Guy following me down Canal Street. And then I was really, really glad she'd taught me that little tip. 

Nowadays, I'd just turn around and snap off a pic or two. And while my phone was in my hand, call for a cop. "

Nothing annoys me more than when I see ""Step 1 for dating: don't be ugly, I guess I failed"". So work out, stop going to great clips for your haircut, and get a nice shirt instead of a video game.

I honestly think people judged her because of how overweight I was when we were growing up. Basically a, ""how on earth can *that* girl be her best friend?"" It was really difficult at times curbing the jealousy when we were tweens, but now that we're older I'm okay with my ""place"" in this world as a fat friend. I think my personality was shaped in part by it in the sense that I decided to do everything I could in my power to make sure people couldn't think of me as just a fat girl.

Unfortunately my head looks like a pumpkin with no hair at all, but I gotta say that that month of pure buzzcut was the most relaxed in terms of haircare ever.

The most important thing is this statement: Noone owes me shit. Nothing. Not friendship, not sex, nothing. It doesn't matter what I want, or need. I'm owed NOTHING. It doesn't matter if I'm nice, kind, or w/e. After that, women are just people. Talk to them. Be cool and treat them like a guy; cause they're just people.

It's already difficult enough for children of color to get adopted as it is, having that as a limitation would make things harder. With us, having 3 black kids with emotional and physical health problems  would have made it really unlikely to have ended up in the sane home like we did, but we were lucky to have someone else who wanted us. It's going to be difficult if the family doesn't take the time to learn about how things will affect you. My family isn't white, but I would compare the situation to the things Randall struggled with in the show This Is Us. Not nearly as much as a problem, especially since it was during a different period of time, but certain things were similar. "

The day after my wedding, I get Facebook notifications that I had been tagged in an ungodly amount of photos (too many to check out). Several months later I was looking through all of the literally hundreds of terrible photos that my mom had posted and reading her captions when I came across the ones from my bridal makeup session. 

One caption on a photo taken about halfway through my makeup application said ""she's starting to look like u/scaredofme again!""

Ofcourse you'll come across like you're ""nagging"" if you have to say it over and over because the kid refuses to do it, but the initial question wasn't a nag, it was just being responsible. It's not the mom's fault shit has to be done.

Then he approached and started conversing with us.  It was really awkward and we both felt very uncomfortable. Then a noisy family showed up to use the nearby pool and he  finally left. He didn't really say anything creepy, it was just his actions, the way he watched us first, then initiated small talk (a maintenance guy doesn't usually socialize) and then leaving when others  showed up.

267,"MY SWEET SUMMER CHILD, you are 21 years of age. You're not ""incel"" you're totally normal and you have *got* to get off subreddits related to incel and the like. 

If people with serious disfigurements can find partners, let me tell you, it's not about your looks. You said elsewhere that you have to succeed with a woman in order to feel confident. That is going about things the wrong way altogether. You need to be real, to be vulnerable, and give up this nonsense.

Going to therapy is a good idea at this point. But getting away from this mindset is priority one. 

I've slept with a few guys who were virgins into their mid to late 20s (one even into his 30s) and they weren't INCELS, it just hadn't happened for them yet."
268,"I feel like there's a large culture alive right now (in Mommy blogs, memes, mom movies, Facebook etc) that make it seem like being a Mom is literally the hardest thing on earth to do, and that Mom-life is so hard. It almost seems complainy, and ""feel sorry for me-y"".

Even Moms who don't work and stay at home with one kid are screaming all over the Internet about how hard their lives are.

I'm not debating that it's very hard, it is. 
I'm just wondering if you can comment on my theory. Thx! "
269,"Recently a good friend of mine who lived in another state passed away very unexpectedly. My husband encouraged me to take some time to go visit her family and grieve while he held down the fort and looked after our daughter. I told him how much it meant to me to know he loved me enough to let me do what I needed and he said, **""I love you this much all the time**.""

I guess I already knew that, but the significance of it didn't really sink in until he said it. What a good guy. :)"

276,"Background: I'm an accountant, so I understand tax law and brackets and stuff more than most, I'd say. 

I once had a man, a lawyer (personal injury and domestic, not tax law), explain to me, with cows and farmers as the example, why people are against certain tax structures. As in ""if farmer A has 10 cows, and farmer B has 100, taxing at 10% is unfair for Farmer A...."" and went on with this. I couldn't stop him, but holyfuckballs that was maddening to sit through. 

I'd say being condescending or not taking me seriously. Also not disclosing that he was married. You don't need to wear a nametag or anything, but your relationship status should, IMO, come up before you invite me out for drinks after work. "

""I cleaned it.""

""With...what?""

""Bodywash."""

280,"Oh god so much the last one. My group of friends started in elementary. Four of us were the chubby girls, and got fatter as time went on. One was tiiiiiiny and gorgeous. 

Two of us focused on losing weight after high school ended and lost a buuunch. Still wouldnt say we were skinny but we went from fat to chubby, yknow? 

Tiny friend dropped us like hot potatoes. And then the other friend once she lost weight. Replaced us all with fatter friends. She had one friend left from the original group who lost all her weight last year, got skinny as fuuck. She finally ditched her too.

Its ridiculous. Only friends she see regularly according to facebook are twice her size. Only photos posted are with her fat friends. "
281,"I screamed ""don't look! I had an accident!"" While running towards him. 

He said with the tablet of breakfast in his hands : ""well, just take off the bedsheets. Put a towel over the mattress. I'm hungry, we'll wash it later. Look: I pressed some fresh orange juice ☺️☺️""


He didn't care at all, but understood right away what I had done. No sign of disgust. 
So we had breakfast in bed, on a towel, watching TV and forgot about the linens until that evening. 


He just mentionned the incidence once: That same day, we went for a walk and when we were almost home he said ""dibs on the toilet, I'll have a longer session.... You already took care of that I guess"" and he cracked up laughing. "

There are a number of companies that I don't purchase from due to their recent history of support for racism, sexism, homophobia, bigotry, anti-birth control, anti-abortion, or other things I personally don't want to support with my dollars. I don't make a big deal out of it; I just stop shopping there. If a company chooses to advertise on a show that is against my beliefs, I am a lot less likely to purchase things from that company because they are voting with their money to support views I find abhorrent. I vote with my money not to support those shows or companies associated with them."
286,"Likewise, wearing a bra. I have no issue with bras - hell, I like lingerie - but I protest that they're not optional. I'm small-breasted and don't need a bra for comfort, yet it would be unprofessional for me not to wear one to work. Sometimes I just don't feel like it. "

288,"When my wife was pregnant, I had planned on not being at the business end when my child was born, not because vaginas were weird or anything, but rather that I imagined it was just a rough thing to watch. When the moment came, however, I was tasked with holding a leg, and saw the whole thing. I was sort of stunned by how NOT bothered I was with seeing it all, as it was actually pretty incredible. It's, of course, your choice what you'd like when you deliver, but I can say that watching the vaginal delivery had no negative impact on our sex lives, or any negative impact on our lives at all."

Beginning of year 2 I got really bad panic attacks and frequently had to leave the classroom. It was only for a half year that I had issues with that so for year 3 and on I was perfectly fine. 

When I was at her birthday party, about 3 months after we graduated she was telling about how she had such a hard time but she got help from.. well someone who told her by a fingertest that she was allergic to garlic or something. 

I spent around 3 hours at her house, and right when I was about to leave she asks: 'Hey animany, didn't you also had a hard time pretty recently? What is that all about?' Referring to the times where I had to leave the classroom 

I told her yes, about 2 years ago, thanks for asking. 

After that I never contacted her again. It still really bugs me that someone who I spent almost everyday with never really bothered to ask. Nothing of value was lost.

Before you think ""awesome I don't have to do it"": She'll do it quietly because if you're not gonna clean it when you live there on your own, it's not worth trying to get you to do it when she's there, and it'll lead to exhaustion/resentment that she has to take care of everything.

And keep it clean. Cleaning isn't just a ""once and done"" thing. It's a habit of raising standards. Make sure your standards get at least as high as hers.

Here is my copy-pasted list of things I'm noticing so far!!!

* the very first thing i noticed walking out of the salon was my head was frickin cold! i could feel the wind in my scalp!!!! 

* i took a shower right away mostly to clean off the little shaved hairs. ummm the feeling of water cascading from the back of your head down your neck??? is amazing???? sidenote, can’t believe i’m getting to have these brand new sensory experiences as a 27 year old without high adrenaline activities or drugs. like i was shrieking with laughter in the shower. 

* however, now that there’s no direction for shampoo to wash out? it falls in every direction and i got shampoo in my eye worse than i can remember in a long longggg time. stomping and swearing and a red eye for like 2 hours bad. it’s not all fun and games.

* *my SO is about to get in the shower right after i had finished one* “oh wait baby let me get my hair out of the drai– OH MY GOSH.” (srsly our house was built in the 40s this will do WONDERS for our plumbing lol)

* it took three days to realize i could take my hair ties off my wrist. the hair ties that i wear day and night unless i’m showering (because they’re the ribbony ones and they take ages to dry). i have a callous on my wrist from these ties. dobby. is. a. free. elf.

* my hair already has a curl pattern???? omg???? it does a lil swirl in the back???? i can’t wait to see how it grows!!!!!!!

* when i lie down i still reflexively do the back of the head scoop and grin like a dope every time i realize i didn’t have to do that.

* cuddling is………so much easier omg

* i keep forgetting because it feels like it could just be a tight ponytail. but then i wiggle my head around. no weight.

* i keep grasping for some feeling of Deep Feminine Loss and i keep coming up empty"
308,"I like having a bush. I don't like being completely shaved (I tried it once and it creeped me out, and it's also extremely itchy when it grows back for me), and it surprises me how many guys are *offended* that a woman wouldn't shave her bush. I've had pubic hair since I was seven, so I feel very odd without it personally. I'm a redhead and my bush looks *awesome*, and I wish we weren't pressured to shave everything. I told my boyfriend I would never wax/shave mine, and he had the right answer: ""If I'm not expected to wax or shave my crotch, it's not fair for a woman to be expected to do that either."" "
309,"You call women ""sluts"" and ""whores,"" morally condemning women for their sexuality all while bemoaning that they aren't having sex with you. You've suggested going to a ""whorehouse"" apparently seeing women's bodies as things that exist to validate your existence and without any care at all for human trafficking. You think that women are ""privileged,"" and bafflingly credit yourself with giving them rights, as if that really could be credited to you or was some act of generosity rather than something women were always owed and should have never been robbed of in the first place. You believe women can't be trusted to decide their own partners and choose wrong (""Chads"") when they aren't choosing you. You refer to women as ""femoids."" You think African women have lower standards and do so because they're ""ugly"" and ""have aids,"" and blame the problems in sub-Saharan Africa on African women dating Chads. Seems pretty misogynist to me, among other things. 

I saw your picture. You're not even ugly. If anything, you're even better than average, and I am not even saying that to be nice. The problem is everything above, your personality. And that is something you absolutely control and have no one to blame for but yourself. The idea of condemning women for dating ""Chads"" is that women pick looks over personality, but if that was true they would have picked you. Look back through your history and read what you've written. Does that seem like a personality women should like, someone who calls women ""femoids"" and sees them as merely things to be used for sex while condemning them for having sex?

Stop blaming your looks and stop blaming women; actually take responsibility for yourself. Step one to doing better is to get out of that toxic sub. It's just a downward spiral. Step two is to see a therapist. There is no shame in getting help. "
310,I avoid Hobby Lobby for that reason.
311,"I see too many on Reddit. One that made me laugh the most is ""Women that don't swallow make selfish girlfriends."" Ahahhahaha. If you're getting a blowjob, you don't get to complain. I give blowjobs even though I don't want to receive oral, but because I don't swallow (it makes me gag/vomit, and my boyfriend doesn't want me to be uncomfortable) it must mean I'm selfish and my boyfriend is a ""cuck,"" right? God Reddit is screwed up to think a style of giving a freaking  *blowjob* is somehow indicative of someone's generosity."
312,"My best friend recently told me a story like that. He sometimes goes to a certain tree stand to enjoy the view and relax. That one time he was standing on it and looking around when he got that uneasy feeling of something being not right. He felt weird and didn't want to be there anymore. Just as he was climbing back down he saw an old couple who were walking by. They saw him too and asked if he was a hunter, to which he said no, just there for the view. Then they informed him that last night their neighbour hung himself from the tree stand.  
He told me this story while we were sitting in a car a few metres from said tree stand.. 
Personally I've also had that gut feeling a few times, usually when alone in a forest. Nothing ever happened though. "
313,Welcome to globalization and complex supply chains.
314,"""Women aren't funny.""

I was watching an Iliza Schlesinger video on YouTube the other day, and most of the comments underneath it were complaining about how not funny she is, and how not funny women are. But somehow Jim Carrey being ""born"" out of a rhino in Ace Ventura is still fucking *hilarious* and super clever."
315,"So, we make ""hmm"" sounds back and forth to each other for a bit.  It usually starts with him and then I'll repeat, and then he does it again.  We go back and forth, very softly and gently repeating ""hmm"" until either we fall asleep again or start talking with real words.

He also gives me ""giraffe kisses.""  If you've ever seen how a giraffe uses its lips to grip something or ""lip"" on something, he does that to me but with kisses.  It makes me laugh.

We also hold hands and face each other, so sometimes he kisses my forehead or pulls my thigh up so it's on his waist.  My favorite is when he rubs my back or strokes my hair.  Sometimes he'll just rest his hand on my head and it makes me calm and sleepy immediately.

Edit: I remembered giraffe kisses!"
316,I shouldn't give up my happiness so that the other person can be happy. Never set yourself on fire to keep the other person warm. 
317,"At best, ""it's disappointing that people hold these views.""

At worst, ""I fear for my life around these people.""

It feels like they think they are owed sex and relationships simply for existing. I think a lot of them are having issues aside from incel stuff, but it manifests in that way. I think most are young and inexperienced, so their views on life and women are very warped."
318,Always trust your gut
319,"Not into men. I identified as bi for a long time and had a lot of bi friends. When I came out as gay, they called me shallow for choosing someone based on their genitalia. And delusional (""no one is 100% gay""). And said maybe my rape trauma was making me hate men, and that I ought to give them a chance. 

Now that it's en vogue to be fluid and ""no label"", I always dread having to tell someone that I'm not into men. The amount of times I've been accused of being a man-hater, or abused as a child! 

What's funny is that those bi friends have so many shallow preferences of their own. One of them only likes skinny people, another only likes androgynous people. Just cus gender isn't one of your preferences, doesn't make you some kind of transcended master... "

323,"My sister's husband was the same with her. :( Could not be attracted to her, it's like he only saw vaginas as somewhere to stick his dick, and it disturbed him to see it in another context. We researched and found that this is common (good NYT piece on it [here](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/23/health/a-perilous-journey-from-delivery-room-to-bedroom.html)), enough that when I give birth I don't want my partner at that end of me either.

333,"This guy I met while studying abroad. We were from the same country, but he had this weird nowhere accent. I couldn't place it and that struck me as weird. He seemed pretty stand off ish and full of himself most of the time. Once a group of us went out dancing. He and I danced to a song (not grinding or anything just sorta face to face bopping around) and he tried to take it further. I said no thanks. He took it a little personally but backed off. Later I told my girlfriends about the experience and how creeped out I was. 

Apparently it got around because later when we were all walking back from a restaurant he pulled me aside and warned me not to talk about that experience anymore to anyone. He also denied coming on to me at the club. He said he was trying to get with another girl and he didn't want her to hear my ""story"" because it would make him look bad and ruin his chances with her. 

It was very disturbing because while he was warning me his eyes were really scary and intense. It seemed like he was trying to intimidate me and scare me into listening to him.  Plus he'd pulled me away from our group and we were walking at night. I quickly said okay just to get out of there. But you can't stop a girl from talking to her girlfriends so later as a big F.U. I told all my friends about my second creepy experience with this weirdo and warned them all to stay away from him. I never hung out around him again. I feel like he was probably a sociopath. "

337,"I've avoided a lot of unwelcome male attention. I've missed out on a TON of wanted male attention. 

The good: I've never once been cat called, sexually harassed or assaulted. I've never felt unsafe around any guys mostly because I'm 100% off the radar. 

The bad: nobody *says* you're the ugly friend but guys start questions with ""hey, you're a girl..."". You get a lot of questions about your friends. Your friends never feels questions about you. You're the funny one. 

Another thing different about being the ugly friend is you don't get away with stuff your typically attractive friends get away with. You still get parking tickets, you still have to be nice to people, and unlike your friends if you sleep with around you're a slut. (People are a lot less willing to call someone a slut if they want to sleep with that person.)"

This difference was I was at the party for an hour, home in bed by 11pm and didn't drink at all. The other girl was there until 5am and was vomiting before class. Someone suggested my anxiety attack was very 'convenient' and inferred I was actually just too hungover or class and the professor took huge offence to it. I got a very angry accusing voicemail and email telling me I had ruined her trust in me and she was disgusted with my behaviour. 

I tried to explain my side of the story but she thought I was just BSing her. We were working on a project after school with a group of 15 and she flat out ignored me for a week afterwards which made it impossible to work and incredibly awkward. She was rude and nasty to me in class, called me a liar in front of everyone.

It took her confirming with the campus doctor (with my permission) that I had been brought into the clinic and they considered calling an ambulance for me for her to believe I wasn't making up my panic disorder. She was actually asked to formally apologize to me in class which she did in the most disingenuous manner possible. She did admit that she felt horrible but that basically it was my fault for keeping my panic disorder a secret from her. 

At the project that night she pulled me aside and said ""I hope you know we are all good now"" and then pretended everything was fine and nothing had ever happened. We were not all good, not from my side. I avoided her for another 2 years and it's only in the last 6 months that we have become amicable. We work in a very close knit field so we can't avoid each other but I will NEVER trust her again. "
340,"That every time this question is asked, the post goes to hell very fast. 

Anyway, no one cares about who is or isn't getting laid. Seriously. Do. Not. Care. 

But people who actually label themselves ""incels"" are creeps who need some serious therapy to get over their bizarre obsession with sex. And it's even worse when they act like they're victims of some conspiracy enacted against them, specifically, by women or society. And the sub is a never-ending pit of stupidity and misogyny. And the complete lack of self-awareness is amazing, like, how can they read what they wrote and *still* act surprised that doesn't appeal to anyone? 

EDIT: I saw your post history, and how you're contemplating suicide. Seriously, see a therapist. There is help out there. "
341,"In retrospect, yes! One thing I noticed later is that my professor did not get along with almost any of their colleagues in their department. They made it sound like everyone else was really petty and immature. At the time, I was sympathetic because my professor *was* an excellent teacher, so I figured they must be exemplary in other aspects of their life as well. But now, I would definitely consider it a red flag. It's fine to not be a social butterfly, but if you're constantly ranting to a freshly-graduated former student about how everyone else sucks and your field sucks and your parents suck (yes, they started unloading to me about their family issues) - maybe *you* are the problem.

My professor had a lot of bitterness and resentment about how other people had let them down, and then I became the latest person in their life to betray them. It was almost like a pattern they kept recreating in their life."

I have excellent references from supervising profs with and am getting average marks in a very small and competitive research stream and the other students are all absolute geniuses. I just can't shake the feeling that somehow I slipped in, managed to fake that I know what I'm doing, and convinced a whole lot of people until they eventually see through it. I guess it all stems from feelings that maybe I'm just not good enough but I can't bring this up to anyone at school. "

357,"My loony toons sister destroyed her apartment and I was charged with dealing with it. She somehow pulled the tub away from the wall, turned on the hot water full blast and turned up the heater. It was like this for a month at least. The water damage was on the outside walls and warped the roof. The rest of the place was a nightmare as well, I swear the monster from star wars when they're in the trash compactor was in her sink. 

Anyway, husband and I show up to help the landlord evict her and see what she's done to the place. We walk in and I saw black mold on the ceiling, the walls, the carpet and what turned out to be anaerobic bacteria in the bathroom everywhere - the colonies were about a foot in diameter. The water/humidity damage warped the floor and the door jams to the bedroom.  We noped the fuck out of there and called one of those emergency clean up companies. 

My family was pissed at me and assumed I was being lazy. When the company showed up to do the estimate they noped the fuck out of there and got their 02 tanks from the van. The mold was so bad, they had to set up a negative pressure around the bungalow/apartment. My friends, both sides of my family and my brother's family all said husband and I were full of shit. Then we got to show them the pictures taken by the company, and they finally believed us. "

359,"I saw this in relationships just minutes ago lol.

You also have to remember this is reddit and these are not normal socially adjusted men who grew up having positive relationships with women. They are threatened and jealous of other men and it's not about not trusting the women, it's veiled insecurity manifesting and projecting as a negative attack on the *woman's* character because the self reflection and subsequent realization that they have years of repressed anger and negativity towards themselves would cause their brains to implode."

363,"I had to nag my ex all the time. You name it, he would avoid it. 
He would put cups on the counter above the dishwasher instead of in the dishwasher, his clothes would be dropped on the floor literally beside his dirty clothes hamper, the toilet roll would be put on top of the empty roll instead of taking the 10 seconds to change it on and on. 
He wouldn't change the tags on his license plate, he would leave plates of food on his desk for weeks, he would leave important mail unopened and then complain when he got late fees or his phone was disconnected. 

He just refused to put in any effort to be an adult or live in a nice clean place and have our life run smoothly. It was one of the many reasons I left him.

Now that he realizes how little effort it would have taken, he actually does those things. His apartment is cleaner than when we lived together, his taxes are filed, his laundry is done, he even washes his sheets. He has admitted it really wouldn't have taken that much effort to live like this and not having me there made him realize how much more work I did because he refused to contribute. He thought it was me making up work to keep him busy and picking on him. 

It was both annoying and vindicating to learn that he realized I wasn't nagging for nothing. 

I won't ever nag again, I've realized how important it is to have a guy who WANTS to live in a clean and tidy space, who wants to be organized. If that means I stay single forever then so be it. d"

This guy, who was a friend of my roommate's friend, went around pointing to all my friends saying ""you're hot"" to each of them and then got to me and said ""you're... cool""... I felt so bad. He was a douchebag anyway...Now I have a boyfriend and he says I'm beautiful... For a long time, I never thought someone would say that to me. "

I told her, obviously I'm getting you baby stuff. But what do YOU want for YOUR gift?

And her response was, ""Nothing, just baby stuff. You know how it is, you have a baby, and suddenly your whole life is just all about him for the next eighteen years. Can't have a life of my own, I just have to think about him now.""

Um, what? Last I checked, having a baby doesn't mean you're not allowed to receive Christmas presents or go out and do things you enjoy. WTF, sister."
367,"Was hanging out with my ex-bf at a bar.  There was this older weird guy who was super drunk but kind of funny.  Just saying oddball things -- older alkie type, drinking alone, clearly a regular there. He kept asking us to hang out with us, because he was lonely.

My ex-bf and I left the bar, and I urged him to walk faster and turn the corner with me. I told him, ""That guy's going to follow us. I want to shake him off.""  Ex-bf was like, ""Nahh.""  

Sure enough, that guy is hustling after us screaming ""I'M LONELY! I WANNA HANG OUT WITH YOU GUYS!""

I have a chronic illness. I told my dad about 5 years ago that I'm in *constant* pain. Every so often he comes up with the above sentence, and I remind him - the pain is still there, it's been there every second of every day for all this time. 

It's exhausting having to repeat it. It's really sad that he just forgets it entirely, considering this is ruling my life right now. And lastly, it's miserable to be reminded that these are ""the best of years of my life"", and I'm being robbed of them! 

I get it from old friends too, who I don't speak to that often. Every time I meet up with them, they assume I'm fine because they've never heard of pain lasting for years. I always say - if I were better, you'd KNOW about it! I'd be screaming it all over Facebook! "

The one with no plans for Friday night, and no real friends in the city I've lived in for 4 years. I'm learning how to live my own life without depending on validation from others. It's hard.

-Piercing a baby's ears. I hate this so much, its a freakin baby! Why do they need jewelry? Let the kid decide they want holes in their ears when they get older- several of my friends' mothers pierced their ears as infants and now they always have holes in their ears (even if they don't wear earrings for a long time). I'm pretty glad my mom didn't do it for me.



-Circumcision. Its mutilation thats practiced only because of tradition and the misconception that it helps keep stuff cleaner down there. It kills a lot of nerves. Its expensive too. (Source: friend is having a baby boy and told me its going to be 200 upfront or 400 day of birth).




-As for me: Wearing make up. I hate the feeling and its too expensive and time consuming. I think a woman is most beautiful when they're happiest/content with their look and not conforming to what others think they should do. Its totally cool if other women enjoy makeup though- you do you boo. :) "

Cons: forgetting to put sunscreen on places that are no longer shaded by hair, needing haircuts more often, growing out is pretty sucky and awkward"

387,"I kind of turned on them, from their perspective. 

My youth pastor was everything to me, kept me alive during my depressed teenage adulthood (abusive childhood, though I didn't realise it at the time, and awful home situation). Nannied his kids in college, spent spring breaks at his house. Considered him and his wife part of my family.

After college, we fell out of touch as I became less religious, and finally our conversations were limited to him disagreeing with my political posts. At some point I said something like, ""you know, I'm really tired of you acting like we have a relationship when all you do is try to pick fights with me"" and he sent me a long letter telling me I was going to inevitably regret my lifestyle (lesbianism), even if it was only in the afterlife, and he was done. I never responded. 

I don't feel bad about how it ended, but apparently my subconscious does because I have a lot of dreams where I'm suddenly in his house and trying to have dinner with his family and no one will talk to me or acknowledge me."

403,"My ex and I had been together 5 years and were living together, he had physically cheated on me 3 years earlier but I decided to give him a second chance.

Things were mostly good and I thought he had finally grown up. Well one night I was on the computer and he told me he was getting in the shower. A couple minutes passed and I got a strange feeling to check on him. I walked into the room with the bathroom out of our bedroom. 

I found him with a burner phone in hand, hiding it against a wall to charge.

Turns out he was back to cheating, he tried to justify himself because he wasn't emotionally cheating... he was just paying and sleeping with hookers.

That was the last straw for me. I left him and moved out. He ended up blaming me for our end saying I didn't give us another chance. 

I've learned to listen to my instincts and trust my gut. Thankfully I got over him almost instantly. I've had a hard time learning how to trust again, but I've been with my current boyfriend for 11 months now and am very happy. "

I usually went with my guy friend from my regular band. Former wrestler, take-no-shit, but wonderful guy. This one night, he was sick, so I went alone. 

We were about 20 minutes in, and this scraggly guy came in carrying a shitty guitar with 5 strings and a can of Natty. He'd let himself in the house and into the basement. I saw him and the hair on my neck stood up. I thought, ""Please don't sit next to me."" But the fucker did. He took over the room, rambling conspiracy theory shit and trying to teach the room (9 people) how to play some song he'd written. He spilled his beer on the carpet. He started playing, and it was like he'd never picked up the instrument. Out of tune, strumming as hard as possible. Two more strings snapped, and I had to duck to not lose an eye. The host guy was exceedingly polite, and looked at me sympathetically, but didn't intervene. 

I faked an emergency text and started to pack my shit. The creeper said to me, ""I want to take pictures of your hands,"" and then tried to give me his number. OMG. I was cool walking out of the house, but sprinted (bass and amp in tow) to the car. 

Told my band mates about him, and one knew who he was. He hits on college girls at the Union constantly. We agreed that the ladies in our band wouldn't go to these things alone anymore. I saw the guy one more time busking downtown and went the other way. God, so creepy. "
409,"&gt;It makes you keenly aware that the usual rules of being a woman don't apply to you.

This is why I try so hard to not compliment other women on their appearances and to remind myself that a beautiful face does not mean a beautiful woman. I'm trying to deprogram myself from giving others special treatment because they're appealing to the eye. I hate that there's this unbreakable attachment between what we think a woman is and attractiveness. This idea that if you're unattractive, you're not a woman. It's incredibly toxic, especially to a woman's self esteem. "
410,"I've been married twice and lived with my partner before marriage each time.

In my current marriage, there was no substantive change in our relationship before/after marriage. We considered ourselves married already and were just waiting to have the actual ceremony. Living together was a very easy thing as we were very compatible in lifestyle, aesthetic, and our relationship. We moved in together full time after less than a month of dating, got married on our one year anniversary, and have been together very happily for 12 years now.

My first marriage was completely different. We both dated and lived together longer before getting married. We had a lot more difficulty living together because our home standards and expectations were very different. We were also both quite young, so we hadn't fully matured into who we would be as adults. We got together when I was around 17, married around 20, and finished the divorce process when I was around 28. Our marriage *did* change our relationship in ways that were (to me) very unexpected. It turned out that he had very different definitions and expectations for ""girlfriend"" vs. ""wife"", so his expectations of each of our roles in the relationship literally changed overnight without warning.  We went from a companionate relationship to one where I was expected to be his quiet caretaker in all things and have absolutely no expectations or choices of my own. After trying to make it work, I decided that I would much rather spend the rest of my life alone than with him, so we divorced."

That is, you type it out, you never talk to a real person. So I submitted a ticket that I wanted to cancel my subscription and get refunds for the character transfers I paid for.  Because when it involves money, they will actually take the time to speak with you on the phone.  So once I had a real person on the phone, I told him what happened and he seemed genuinely upset and wanted to help me... but they have some rule about first time offenders and since my other tickets had not been ""logged"" properly, he couldn't do anything.  He sifted through months of chat log for me and stayed on the phone with me for over an hour trying to make it right, but he couldn't."

*2 Go to university

*3 Get a Good Job

*4 Get married

*5 Buy a house

*6 Have a baby or 2 (but not more than two)

I've seen it called the Life Script as well. 

You can't vary from this. I left school and got married, then had a baby, then went back to school. Everybody freaked out. 

""If you leave school, you'll never finish!"" 

""You can't get married! You're too young! You haven't finished school!"" I was 24. My cousins got married at the same age, but they had their degrees, so that was ok. 

""Was your baby planned? How are you going to finish school?"" Yes, he was. People do go to school with kids.
