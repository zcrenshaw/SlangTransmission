0,"My 15 year old had her first boyfriend. After about 5 months she told me ""sometimes you are just getting the right attention from the wrong person. I think I need to end it even though I like the attention."" Surprisingly insightful."
1,"I'm not a mom, I'm a beardy dude, but I have a relateable experience.

I was working a weekend gig at a drag race track and one of my coworkers said they had a grandson that *loves computers* and could he hang out and watch me setup the track lights/monitors/etc.

They warned me that he had aspergers and could be quite a handful. I said no problem at all, send him in. I expected a goofy kid that would be impressed by blinky lights.

What I got was a 13 year old that described to me in detail how he compiled his own linux kernel and had a fascination with cryptography. That's not the end of this blindsided story.

Over the next few years he would hang out with me for a few days each month during racing season. I got to know him and his family quite well. His mom was a deadbeat and he was being raised by his super, super, super religious grandparents. He certainly had some attention issues and would often chew on his shirt sleeves, but otherwise a great kid.

One early morning I'm sipping my coffee trying to wake up and doing a final track inspection in the heavy fog, walking the 1/4 mile down the track and back looking for screws, tools, etc that might muck up a dragster's tires.

He's ~16 now and he's telling me all about some stock trading stuff he's gotten into. I'm half listening, mostly because it's all over my head. Then he stops and he says, 

*""fievelm, can I tell you something?""*

*""Yeah, what's up""*

*""Do you know what transgender means? I want to be a girl, physically.""*

I froze. A million things going through my head. There's no way his grandparents would allow that. Why is he telling me this? What are his options?

In that time that all of that was going through my head he just continued on, telling me that he's felt that way for years, he knows he can't tell his grandparents, his plans on what to do about it in the future.

He didn't want anything out of me except someone to talk to openly about it. I was really, really, honored that he trusted me so much.

That was the last year I worked at the track, and I fell out of touch with him and his family.

However, about a year ago I got a FB friend request from some woman I'd never met, who was living in Thailand. I assumed it was spam and ignored it until she messaged me and said, ""You might remember me by my old name...""

She's doing great and from what she tells me her grandparents were very much not onboard, but they had started coming around recently and were trying to be supportive."
2," I'm going through a hard time right now and my daughter asked if there was anything she could do to help me. I joking said ""I could use some xanax"" and she said ""okay they're  $5 each, how many do you want?"" She's 19. "
3,"Lots of women struggle to orgasm, and penetration isn't what causes it for the majority of women. There is nothing wrong with you if you struggle with this, you are normal. And don't fake it to make your partner happy, you're hurting yourself by not being open about it. It's ok to take time to figure it out. "
4,"I have this quote saved, it got me through my last break up. I'm not sure of the source but I got it from Reddit :)

""'The second time you fall in love with someone, you’re going to feel so relieved. When you get your heart broken for the first time, you can’t imagine loving someone else again or having someone else love you. You worry about your ex finding love before you do, you worry about being damaged goods. And then it happens. Someone else loves you and you can sleep well at night.

The second time you fall in love with someone, it’s going to feel different. The first time felt like a dream almost. You were untouched, untainted by anyone. You accepted love with wide open arms and desperation. “Love me, love me, love me!” So you did. And then it fell apart and left you shocked to the core. You realized that people could be cruel and break your heart. You realized that people could stop meaning the sweet things they said to you just yesterday. So when you go into it again, you’re going to keep in mind everything that you’ve learned. You’re going to say, “Love me, love me, love me…until you don’t. In which case, I would like some advance warning. Thanks!”

The second time you fall in love with someone, you’re going to compare it to your first love. That’s okay. That’s natural. You’re going to be studying the new love with judgement and wariness. “My ex never liked broccoli. Why the hell does this one eat so much broccoli?!” Discovering that you have the ability to love multiple people who are different and feel different is initially very jarring. Loving an unfamiliar body will leave you disoriented and in dire need of a map. That’s okay too. That’s to be expected. Just ask the new love for directions.

The second time you fall in love with someone, you’re going to suffer from a bout of amnesia. You’re going to poke and prod at your lover’s body and be like, “Wait, how do I do this again? How do I love you? I think it starts with us having a moment together in some coffee shop, right?” It’s going to feel scary at first. Falling in love is sort of like riding a bike though. You never really forget.

The second time you fall in love with someone, you’ll be a more sane person. Your first love is when you get all of your insanity out. You behave like an insane monster because your mind is freaking out about all these new powerful feelings. By the second time, however, you have an idea of what works and what doesn’t. It’s by no means perfect. The insanity will make a cameo at some point. “Peek a boo. I’m here! Hope you didn’t forget about me!” But you can usually shoo it away after awhile.

The second time you fall in love with someone, you will hopefully have better sex. Do not quote me on this.

The second time you fall in love with someone will still be exciting and you might even talk about moving in together or marriage. It will feel more “adult.” You have no idea what adult love actually is but you think it involves making coffee for each other in the morning and maybe even getting a dog. “This is my dog, Xan. I got him with the second person I fell in love with because that’s what you do! The first person I was in love with would’ve killed a dog.”

The second time will not be the first time. The first time is an insane magical life gift that you can never reclaim. But that’s okay. The second time is more real anyway. The second time can involve some amazing love.'"""
5,"Wanting sex is normal, as is not wanting it and preferring to wait. Your value as a human being is not dependent on whether or not you're a virgin. "
6,"My daughter is very open with me and no matter how much I internally cringe I always cheerfully listen and give advice.  Sex, dugs, etc are not off the table and she can always ask.

However... When she started talking about her and her first boyfriend I had to finally give a few boundaries.  Basically, you can tell me about something but I don't need every single detail described at length.  I also gave her the advice that intimate details of her sexual experiences should be kept between the couple.  It builds trust.  But she can definitely tell me the general idea and ask for advice."
7,"I have an anxiety disorder that is now decently controlled after years of therapy and finally finding the right medication. My son unfortunately inherited it. 

I recognized it early and he's been in treatment as well but it is so hard to be a teenager, never mind a teenager dealing with a psychiatric problem. 

He is now 16. He is at the age where he wants a girlfriend. He wants to know he's going to be ok. So I have tried to reassure him he can be happy. 

The other day he told me: ""Mom, people like you and me don't get happy. We will always have to try so hard just to survive."" "
8,"Discharge is 100% normal. Don't wear panty liners 24/7 to try to ""help"" it. You'll just give yourself a yeast infection and make the discharge worse. 

Bodily functions are normal "
9,"it's been mostly fine, because wealthy people don't really flaunt it or have their own subculture in his culture. it's considered rude and tasteless to pretend you're above the ''average joe''. it actually took me forever to discover that he wasn't a poor student just like me."
10,[deleted]
11,That she's had a three-way and she just got her nipples pierced.   
12,"Damn, she's got it figured out better than some of my friends in their late twenties."
13,"He very calmly said, ""Mom. I'm not you."" 

It stung a little, but also, yay! I was quite the fuck up."
14,"Women are allowed to crave sex too. Female characters who express lust are often completely defined by that characteristic, and it's really annoying to me. There's nothing wrong with thinking about sex frequently. "
15,New locks for all your doors.  First thing I do with each new home. 
16,"I grew up under a very conservative family with a dad that worked in politics and had a lot of old school values. Stuff like I wasn't allowed to wear pants, so it was dresses skirts, wasn't allowed to wear makeup, couldn't go out with friends ever, never got to date, never went to school dances.

The worst part was that I had two older brothers who got to do whatever they wanted. Dad bought them nice cars when they graduated highschool, they got to go to a fancy private university, and when one of my brothers went to jail for putting his girlfriend in the hospital, my family rushed to his side.

When I graduated highschool I had good grades so I begged my parents to let me go to Texas A&amp;M. I got to go for one semester and when I went home for Christmas my parents told me I had my fun, but it was time to move back to my hometown and settle down/find someone to marry. I said no I wanted to go back to school and they said that if I didn't do what they said, they wanted nothing to do with me. They gave me 500 dollars and told me not to come back. I didn't really know where to go so I drove to LA.

Six years have passed since then. Over those past six years I've spent time homeless, worked as a prostitute, and struggled with drug addiction. After hitting rock bottom, I moved out of LA, and tried to get a fresh start in Oregon.

Now, I'm 25, gay, I work at a really hip coffee shop where I'm super happy, I live in a nice house in a really cool little neighborhood with my best friend. And I'm allowed to wear pants.

Also, I didn't know what red pill meant outside of the Matrix, but judging my the other posts I think this fits in. If it doesn't I'm sorry for rambling."
17,"Fairly difficult, his mother often refer to my family as ""low income"". She has stated many times she didn't understand how my husband could live in my house and not become sick. It wasn't the nicest but it was clean. Has often explained how although I am use to being dirty, I should learn that her standards as they are much higher and I need not to subject him to my dirtyness. He is actually a slob! So yeah my MIL definitely looks down on her southern white trash daughter in law. I just do my best to avoid her.  "
18,"Well, she's a logical thinker and a problem solver for sure lol!"
19,"She's my little angel and we are definitely close but man, some stuff just comes out of left field.  Lol. I will always remember the day in 7th grade when they had the big sex education day and she came home and said, ""So I have a lot of questions."". I was in the middle of drawing detailed diagrams when her dad walked in, heard the conversation and immediately went back outside."
20,"Amazing that you are only 31, considering that you clearly got married in 1954."
21,"Still not quite over it. Was constantly told women were less than...I was engaged at 20 because women need to be supported by men. ( I was homeschooled) 
Got married as a virgin ( required) at 21.

I tried to take my life twice. 

My parents ignored me when I asked for help after my husband abused me. 

My church forced my husband to take classes on how to control me and how men deserve respect after I asked for help. 

They sent me a book about arguments in a marriage that emphasized ""just apologize to your husband."" 

I am a 31 year old divorced gay woman still trying to recover. "
22,"I was always afraid about going shopping with my son. I've heard other mothers complain about it. But with my son, sometimes I take him shopping so he quits messing up my house. Obviously this depends on the child, but he's good 95% of the time.

I will let him play in the mall's play area for a bit but he's happy in his stroller looking at people. He's fine anywhere with carts: grocery stores, Walmart, Target,Costco, etc. He willl just look around and say ""hi"" to everyone and happily kick his feet and laugh.

Obviously, a different kid may act differently "
23,"When my 13 year old son said, ""it's fine to have a side chick as long as both girls know.""  "
24,"My first one night stand was confusing as hell to me. It took me a couple hook ups to realize that you could have passionate sex with someone, cuddle and lock fingers all night, and the next morning they could want nothing more to do with you. It's hard for me to understand how  the emotions could feel so ""real"" in the moment, but in reality mean nothing at all once that moment is over. And this is why I can no longer do one night stands."
25,"When my daughter said"" I have been cutting myself for a really long time and I want to die"". I promptly took her and admitted her into a mental hospital. When the nurse made her strip so she could inspect her body, she came out of the bathroom and told me she had HUNDREDS of old and new cuts all up and down the tops of her legs. 
"
26,"I don't know about buying, but I do know about saving. Make sure you're putting away money to cover big expenses (Water heater, furnace, major appliances) that can go bad at the most random of times. "
27,"Yes. My husband comes from a very wealthy family, but they are all really lovely and wonderful people and I've never felt ""less than."" I come from a dirt poor clan of hoarders. It's just been an adjustment. As an illustrative example, we moved in together, bought a bedroom set, sheets, whatever. After like 10 days, husband suggests we wash the sheets. I am utterly flabbergasted and reply, ""You're supposed to wash bed linens?"" 

We survived that but I'm still scarred from the realization that I slept on the same unwashed bedsheets (until they were damaged enough to be replaced, maybe 3x in 15 years) for my entire childhood / adolescence. "
28,"I didn't have bridesmaids.

But I also had 10 people at my ceremony.

&gt; i'm also worried people who attend may think it's strange

I am going to let you in on a little secret.  No matter what you do, no matter how traditional or non-traditional you make your wedding, no matter what you serve - *SOMEONE* is going to hate your wedding because humans are judgy assholes sometimes.  Even my small wedding attracted huffs from those that *were* invited and especially those who were not invited.  DO WHAT YOU WANT.  Bring a waterbottle for all the salty tears during the wedding planning process."
29,It's so sweet of him to wave all those red flags for you right where you can see them. 
30,That the girl he cheated on me with was tighter. 
31,"When the thought of not having them in your life feels like a welcome relief, it's time to leave. "
32,"""Me too, honey. That's why Uncle Dave comes around often."""
33,"Aw, the amount of trust she has is amazing. "
34,"I got one from an unknown number describing everything I was doing at the time. I'd like to think it was one of my friends messing with me, but I didn't recognize the voice, and no one fessed up. "
35,"Bedtime: I have four girls; 4, 5, 9 &amp; 10...they're the best behaved kids ever, I swear...every night, they'd be doing their thing, playing, tv, ipads or whatever. Come 7:50'ish, ""time to clean up wash up for bed""! And maybe repeating myself twice, they clean up their mess and shut down in the playroom  (TV, lights, etc), one by one they wash up, the older two set out toothbrushes for the younger two, then grab their school clothes for the next day. Turn down their bed and everything...one by one they give me a hug and kiss good night. The only thing I have to do is tuck in the younger two and turn off their light. Bam! Everyone is in bed by 8:30!  They don't fight me when it's bed time, they don't make a fuss, nothing...they really just accept that hey, it's bed time."
36,"I may be biased, but as a historian I think it's a pretty dope profession. I got paid to live in Venice for four months and look at the single surving copy of a 600 year-old text, which was pretty neat. I've also got historian friends currently living abroad in Wales, India, Italy, Spain and Morocco for research atm, and most of us are bi- or tri-lingual (in fact, it's a requirement at my university that medievalists be able to read at least four languages). "
37,"I was on a team we called ""Nice Pants"" so we'd say thanks! Every time we were called."
38,"Date was going great. He was charming, funny, handsome. Near the end of dinner he says he notices I didn't put my formal education in my profile, where did I go to college? I tell him I haven't gone. He asks if I'm joking, and I say no. He moves past it and pays for dinner. I say this was really fun let's do it again? He goes ""Sorry but I really only date people who are educated. But we can go fuck if you want?"" 

With a huge smile on my face I told him I don't fuck guys who can't date girls just because they didn't go to college.  I thank him for dinner and leave. "
39,"So, I've been lucky enough to have probably the best conditions for coming out as transgender, but it just warms my heart that people like you are out there, just accepting, and offering a small ray of light in the vast cesspool of hate that many unfortunately wade through.

Thanks. And I hope you keep somewhat in contact now again! "
40,"I didn't have my first O till 28. Nothing was working. No finger, tongue or toy could wake the beast. Finally last year my room mate was out and I had the place to myself for the night. I decided to try something new. I'd noticed the few times I'd smoked weed I'd gotten some tingles down there before passing the fuck out. So this round I decided to make the effort to stay awake and see where it goes. I seduced the shit out of myself. I lit all my candles, burned some incense, turned on my string lights and cranked my new favorite band at the time (kings of leon) then hopped in the bath tub with a glass of wine, dark chocolate and an edible. Soaked and chilled for about half an hour before I started feeling giggly and the body tingles...go time. I dried off, slipped into my silky nighty and crawled in bed. My arsenal was already set out on my nightstand. My comically large dildo, my rabbit vibe and my lube. Started with a little lube on my two fingers and started flicking the bean.....it was meh. ""Oh great"" I think. ""My last idea and it's a dud. I guess I *am* broken"" but then I stopped trying to play it like a DJ and put a finger on each side of my clit and moved up and down instead of left to right. Wow. Id never had sensation bellow the belt before. I'm talking 0 ladies. This was a revelation. I wasn't broken! I had hope. I actually cried a little. It felt fucking GREAT but I still couldn't quite reach that edge, so I moved onto my silly huge purple dildo given to me as a gag gift. I started with one hard deep thrust and my whole body reacted. After a few seconds of trying to go slow I gave in and just started hammering the ever loving fuck out of myself. ""Is this what sex is *supposed* to feel like!? Oh my god, I felt like I'd discovered America. Yet still I wasn't getting all the way there and both my shoulders were tiring out. Alright, gloves off. Out comes the rabbit. I pump away a few more times then flip the switch. Sweet. Jesus. H. CHRIST!!!! WHAT!? I stopped breathing, I clenched my abs and my ass and curled up like a dead roly polie. I felt myself rushing towards the edge, cresting it and then exploding over it. As ""Closer"" blared from my speakers my body was paralyzed with titanic waves of the most insane pleasure I've ever known in my entire life, radiating out from my clit, racing through my body and crashing into my brain. About 5-6 waves total. Every muscle gave out at once, I flop to the bed covered in sweat I didn't realize had formed and gasped for breath I didn't realize I hadn't been taking. I promptly blacked out with a smile on my face and my vibrator still inside me. Now when that song pops on my Pandora I get super turned on and can't stop smiling.   "
41,"This is basically ""What fucked up ideas did you have about sexuality as a teen that you don't want someone else to go through?""

Here's mine:

1) Wear what you want but know that sexuality isn't something you wear or perform. You're a sexual person, not a sexual persona. 

2) Feel free to have your own sexual thoughts about friends or other people in your life. Don't feel bad, its normal and healthy. Its also ok to cultivate  your own sexual fantasies rather than bending over backwards to fulfill someone else's. "
42,"Sporty, for sure. She doesn't have the flair that the others have but I'e seen her on a british panel show lately and she was quite easy going (not like Scary, ruiner of panel shows).

I guess if we were going to cook together I'd do a pizza or something. it's easy enough to make tasty with good ingredients, but doesn't require a lot of technical skill to put together."
43,That she was pregnant and keeping the baby. At 15. The grandkid turned out cute though. 
44,"There's a spectrum of desire and wherever you sit on it is fine. You might like boys, you might like girls, you might like both or neither or people who identify as something else, and it might change over time. If you can accept whatever comes you'll save yourself a lot of angst. But it might take some time and that's okay too.

You might find you want sex more than your partner. There's nothing wrong with either of you. Don't take it personally or try to bully your partner into more frequent sex because you've bought into the lie that guys want sex all the time. 

Your orgasm is just as important as your partner's. But it's also fine if one or both of you don't come sometimes. 

Sex isn't dirty, but sometimes sex with the wrong person will make the most well-adjusted of us feel that way. Try to have sex with people who treat you with respect and make you feel good about yourself. But don't beat yourself up too much if that plan goes to hell.

Have fun and be safe! "
45,"Kinda creepy, but also really *really* lame. I liked this guy, and I knew he liked a particular band from a genre of music I'd had zero exposure to before. So I looked up everything I could about this band, which involved buying a lot of magazines because it was the 90s, and bought one of their t-shirts so he could casually see me wearing it and I could start name-dropping all over the place.

I even went to one of their concerts so I'd have an autographed CD sitting in the car when I got the opportunity to give him a lift home.

I still have the t-shirt and the CD, sitting in the back of my wardrobe in their own little box of shame.

Edit: also, to buy their t-shirt I had to drive a 500km round-trip to Melbourne."
46,"The girl he cheated on me with told me. She had no idea he was in a relationship and when she found out, she let me know what happened. Strangely enough, we're actually sorta friends now. "
47,"In 8 years of sex and 12 years of masturbation, I've come only twice from penetration alone and the first time (when my fiance and I were in that early ""you are so intriguing and intoxicating"" phase) was so special. It's not like it was the most intense or multiplied orgasm, it was just like ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED and ""whoa, my body can do that?"""
48,"If you have a dog, you don't have a choice in the matter.  They make sure to get to you first."
49,he fingered me after some pretty intimate foreplay and it took maybe two minutes for me to hit the O. i felt like my body was going to explode into a million pieces and i actually got light headed. it was pretty wild 
50,I am super into genealogy and I once went on a genealogy website and traced his family back to see if we had any common ancestors.... 
51,"He said I was the lowest kind of girl that only bottom feeders go for, and I pointed out he had messaged me first. "
52,"I'm not sure the Red Pill community officially existed in the 80's/90's but my Dad was married/divorced 5 times because he thought his wife shouldn't work and was only good for sex, cooking and cleaning. So yeah, I think that qualifies.  He's probably their poster boy.  Unless he is just a pure misogynist but I'm not entirely sure there's a difference.

Luckily my Mom turned out to be a bad ass who told him to suck it once she saw him treating me differently to my brother.  Brother was worshiped, I got the shit kicked out of me for not eating my broccoli.  Brother got a private education, I did not because why would a girl need to know how to speak French, do math and go to College?  Guess what asshole, I got into Berkeley because I'm smart and earned a scholarship!

A positive effect it's had on me is that I'm independent AF.  You will never find me looking to a man for money, support, reliance etc. A potential negative is that I will also never trust a guy to look out for me when shit comes down.  I know I'm on my own. We all are. I just learned it at a young age.  Honestly though, I'm glad I saw that side of the male psyche. I feel bad for the girls who had a hero as a Dad and then were crushed later in life when a guy let them down. At least now I have genuine respect and loyalty for guys who treat women with kindness and respect.  I certainly don't hate men, quite the opposite. I understand he was not the norm and there are plenty of decent, lovely, amazing dudes out there.  My brother is one of them.

For any 'red pillers' reading this, please also note that my Dad will die alone and loveless since his treatment of my SIL and niece has also turned my brother against him. So wake up boys. Stop being assholes. We're all human and we all want love."
53,"Context always matters.

Still living at home when you're 25 because you're lazy (no job, no savings, etc) is completely different than living at home at 25 because you're trying to pay off student loans or take care of your ill parent—or something equally responsible.

But really, this whole Western/American thing of it being weird and immature to live with your parents if you're an adult is ridiculous."
54,Figure out who likes me for who I am. It gets extra difficult when the guy himself misreads his own feelings and mistakes physical attraction (+ friendly interest) with romantic interest. Extra heartbreaking when he realizes it was mostly lust after I already fell in love.
55,"Obviously this depends on where you were living before/what was provided to you/what you already had, but the biggest things I can think of are:

* Basic tool kit

* First aid kit

* Fire extinguisher(s)

* CO / Fire alarms 

Most other things you can buy as you need.  I like to have a stock of batteries and light bulbs, but you can run out and get those when needed."
56,"Sometimes I tell myself I would want future daughters to be open with me about things like this, but then other times I hope that they will never ever share personal details with me. How do you even respond to that? Lol"
57,She sounds absolutely vile.
58,"&gt;Look, having nuclear—my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart—you know, if you’re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I'm one of the smartest people anywhere in the world—it’s true!—but when you're a conservative Republican they try—oh, do they do a number—that’s why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune—you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we’re a little disadvantaged—but you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me—it would have been so easy, and it’s not as important as these lives are (nuclear is powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what's going to happen and he was right—who would have thought?), but when you look at what's going on with the four prisoners—now it used to be three, now it’s four—but when it was three and even now, I would have said it's all in the messenger; fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don't, they haven’t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it’s gonna take them about another 150 years—but the Persians are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us.

This somehow qualifies as a sentence. "
59,"This guy definitely didn't do anything intentionally but it all added up to make an experience I wasn't willing to repeat.

- Where I lived the bus (only one a walkable distance from me) was known to be unreliable. After a while of waiting I messaged him to know I was waiting on the ""unreliable"" bus and would likely be a few minutes late, and I'm really sorry usually I'm on time. He replied *""Oh don't worry, I figured you would be, girls are always late.""*

- Since I was late (by 10 mins) he sat at the bar and had a drink. I sort of hovered at the bar when I arrived expecting us to move to a table or booth... Nope. It felt awkward to bring it up so I just sat at the bar with him.

- As we were talking he kept looking over my shoulder. I turned around and there was a TV showing a football match. I asked if his team were playing (while wondering why he had arranged a date if he wanted to watch football), and he said ""Oh no, but I love football and it's on, so...""*

- I went to the bathroom, when I came back he said something like *""Oh I just got a smell of your perfume, it's really nice""* and then he leaned in to my neck to smell me, but was also trying to use it as a move to kiss me and it was just awkward and weird.

- Discussing our hobbies and interests he told me *""The most important things in my life are 1. drinking 2. football 3. music 4. my mates 5. girls""* -- great to know I'd literally be the lowest priority to you if you were to start dating."

61,"my parents brought pedophiles around and me and my little sister. we received lessons (physical punishment) if we made dad's friends act funny, or as dad explained ''made him think you're his girlfriend''. we were 6 and 5. when the neighbor raped me, my dad's first reaction was to spank me as hard as he could. i think a large part of it was that it was someone he didn't suspect and watch closely, he felt a lack of control. i remember how betrayed i felt because i hadn't played in a way that showed my underwear, or anything else i was taught would make that man want to be my boyfriend.

my dad regularly told my mom that he is a man and she is a woman. he would dry heave if he saw a pad or tampon wrapper. he told me that the reason women keep their legs crossed is because it keeps ''the smell'' contained. we weren't allowed to close the doors to our room except when changing. shaving anything, tampon usage, makeup, and boys were all forbidden until 16 years old. i remember vividly one time when we were getting fast food, that my father ''joked'' that if the man put an extra burger in the bag, he could take me out behind the alley. i was 14.

what they call redpill, i just call having backwards ideas from the 50's and being a fucking weirdo.

ETA: i won't clog up the thread by replying to everybody, so thank you for your kindness! i consider myself lucky to have made it into another life entirely (with only three psychiatric diagnoses!)."
62,"My fiancé's family is very wealthy, whereas mine is not. My fiancé's father is on the board at our university. His family is the MOST generous, kind, and loving group of people I have ever met. They have never been rude to my family or demeaning in any way towards the wealth gap. Just a few hours ago, my future father in law sat me down and told me he paid off the rest of my tuition for the year (which he has done several times). I go to an expensive school, but I have worked hard for scholarships and took out a loan. He also told me that after graduation (in a few months) we will figure out what to do about my loans because he doesn't want my fiancé and I to start out in a lot of debt. 

I am so blessed and fortunate to get to be a part of such a wonderful family! I don't think this is always the case, but I am so glad to experience their generosity! "
63,"Sex **shouldn't** hurt. It's a new sensation so there may be discomfort, but pain isn't okay and certainly shouldn't be expected. "
64,"Not my kid (mine's still a toddler, and my stepsons are under 10), but my niece admitted to me that she was caught in a lesbian love triangle. Her mother's uber-Christian, as is that entire side of the family. Her mom's passive, but her stepfather is aggressive and hyper-critical of her every word and move, so it's something I'm definitely keeping a secret for her. It will cause explosions, since she's supposed to be the chaste little straight blonde white stereotypical girl she was 8 years ago.

Still hoping that works out in my niece's favor one way or another."
65,"But, to add to this, if you REALLY think your discharge is abnormal or you have excess amounts, it is 100% okay to go to the doctor and get it checked out. "
66,"My 16 year old son told me he thinks he might be a girl. Zero indication of anything like that from him up to that point. If it had been his older brother, no one would have been surprised. I told him I would support whatever he chooses and he is going to therapy to figure things out."
67,"I got a phone call at 7 am once from a woman asking for Tom. I said wrong number. There was a LONG sigh, then she said, ""Look, I know he's there. Just put him on the phone."" I said, No, you really have the wrong number and she said, ""Ok, well tell him HIS WIFE called, ok?"" Next day 7 am, same thing. And the next day. Finally I answered and said, ""Look, I don't know who your husband is cheating on you with, but it's not me. This is a wrong number and if you don't stop calling me and harassing me every morning I'm going to call the cops."" She stopped, thankfully. "
68,"I haven't gotten the chance to use it yet, but I like Bed, Bath, and Beyoncé "
69,"it's okay if you have no interest in sex, or if after trying it you don't enjoy it. it doesn't mean you're a freak, or that you're destined to be alone forever.

70,"My friends and I used to play as ""I Wish This Microphone Were A Dick."" We're not mature.  

Edit: spelling "
71,"Also receptionists. If you know the receptionist and the custodian, you're plugged into everything.

Receptionists are especially great for things like, ""Does so-and-so *ever* answer their phone? How do I get ahold of them??"" As a person who frequently gets dodged by people I need to meet with (scary HR lady), this is vital information."
72,I feel like I don't even need to read anything else in this thread. Sorry everyone else. 
73,"Similar story,  but mine actually has a resolution and I found out who the caller was.  

When I was 17, A woman started calling me at 5am every day,  just a few minutes after my boyfriend left for work each morning.  

She would demand to speak to Kevin and refused to accept it was a wrong number because Kevin apparently texted me on my number and she copied it directly.  The first day she called she sounded upset like she was crying,  the second day,  she sounded frustrated and tried to explain that she wasn't mad at me because I probably didn't know,  but because I'm being uncooperative she knows I'm a selfish home wrecker.  I stood by my ""lady,  I have no idea what your talking about"" statement.  The third day,  she was downright abusive, calling me names over the phone and threatening to follow Kevin, find me and cut off my clitoris. 

I told my boyfriend what was happening and showed him some of the texts this woman was now sending me in which she described how she would hurt Kevin in from of me so we could both be punished.

That night my boyfriend came home with Kevin, his 32 year old Co-worker.  Turns out my boyfriend used Kevin's phone to text me because his phone had died, my boyfriend used his own sim card so I received a text from him as usual,  but the text remained on the phone itself,  and it also loaded passed messages between me and my boyfriend from when my boyfriend had his sim in the phone,  and Kevin's fiance had seen it and thought Kevin was texting his mistress. 

Anyway, Kevin crashed on our couch for a few nights while he figured stuff out,  because he wasn't comfortable with the idea that his finance threatened to chop off a 17 year old girl's clitoris with zero real proof he was even having an affair. "
74,"Scandinavians sound so fucking nice compared to classist fucking chileans, damn."
75,"Pretty much my husband's entire family is well off, not insanely rich, but very comfortable.  A lot of them excelled and are notable people.  My family was/is pretty poor, spending some time at the poverty level and now very solidly working class.  Our childhoods were so, so different.

But my in laws have been great from day one.  We love to joke about their high standards.  It's funny to see how jaded they can be compared to me.  Like, I took a trip with them to Hawaii, and I got to go snorkeling for the first time.  I thought it was amazing, but they were out of the water after like 10 minutes because it was ""oookay, but not as good as [some other beautiful place I'll never go]."" Had a good laugh about that.  

They're really nice and tactful folks, though.  They'd never say anything bad about my family.  I did have to learn how to properly set a table.  The first time I set the table, things were out of place, and everyone just silently moved things to their proper places.  There's been little, slightly embarrassing, things like that."
76,"I've been thinking about that week as a chance to slow down a little and take care of myself. More time alone, more sleep, baths, yoga etc. I've actually started looking forward to being on my period because of it :)"
77,"I slept with a guy about 5 months ago and never really spoke to him again. Except this Valentine's Day I get this long text from him checking up on me and asking me on a date. It was a bit of a strange message and wasn't interested so I politely declined. The next morning I woke up to a two minute long voicemail from him. He's crying and told me that I was pregnant with his child and he will accept the consequences of sleeping with me. He went on for two minutes about how he can't sleep at night because he definitely got me pregnant. So I texted him and reassured him that I'm definitely not pregnant.... at all.... It was 5 months ago, I would know by now. I also was pretty pissed and told him that he was being psychotic (I realize that now I was being a little too harsh). I said ""I really hope you don't do this with every person you sleep with because it's a little crazy."" He responds, ""I do do this to every girl. I'm sorry, I'll leave you alone now."" He has still texted me 3 times after just double checking. I can't believe he freaks out like this with every girl and still gets laid. "
78,"All I did was listen, honestly I didn't have any advice for her at the time. It took serious guts on her part to come out to her grandparents.

Last I heard from her she had found a partner and they were planning on traveling the world. She'd already made it to Thailand and I think Vietnam was next.

Makes me chuckle a little bit because I remember a conversation I had with her grandmother over a campfire. She was lamenting that her grandson was probably going to have to live with them forever, and that he'd never be able to live an adult life, blah blah blah. "
79,"On the less disgusting side, ""drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars.""  

Please tell me where these drugs are hiding. Unless, of course, he's only saying that because the least expensive candy bar he's ever seen is like $20 artisanal chocolate.

81,"I never did, but I lost my hair from chemotherapy for cancer. I was very attached to my hair before (long and thick) but I felt beautiful bald. I never expected it. I was almost sad when my hair grew back. "
82,I mentioned this to someone else not long ago and she had no idea what I was talking about but get yourself a fire safe box to put all your most important documents in. 
83,"Yasss. 

Apparently on Twitter for a while there was some hashtag thing with girls posting their underwear boasting they didn't have any discharge on it and it was supposed to mean they weren't ""dirty"" or something, it made me so sad. 

No discharge means dead skin cells and excess bacteria are partying it up in ya vag my girl!"
84,"I became suspicious when he changed his habits hugely - his hygiene improved massively, he bought new clothes and aftershave, went out with 'friends' more often and lost interest in sex with me. I asked him, and asked him and asked some more and he eventually confessed. "
85,"Blocked blocked blocked 

Do not engage except to tell them once that there is no chance of rekindling things and you will not be responding.

But If you feel unsafe do not block and keep a record of all attempted communications in case he escalates and you need to go to the police.

Sorry if you're dealing with one atm"
86,"I personally don't think cumin gets enough love. I mainly use it for Mexican or Middle Eastern dishes, but adds such a nice touch to potatoes, mac and cheese, and essentially any meat. 

Chili oil has also become a standard in all my cooking lately. "
87,And.... replace the door jam screws which hold the locks striker plate and striker with extra long screws for reinforcement in case someone attempts forceful entry.
88,"I never buy from Urban Outfitters. I also try to avoid Nestle, but it's hard since they have their fingers in so many pots.

On the other side, I ALWAYS buy Girl Scout cookies because well, they're delicious, but also because the GSA teach girls valuable skills, are partnered with Planned Parenthood, and have no problem with trans girls being scouts. I also try to buy locally-sourced food and clothing when I have the extra cash.

EDIT: Finally home, so here are some links about Urban Outfitters:

[The time they sold a tapestry a little too reminiscent of the patches gay Holocaust victims were forced to wear.](http://www.adl.org/press-center/press-releases/holocaust-nazis/adl-to-urban-outfitters-remove-tapestry-reminiscent-of-holocaust-garb.html?referrer=http://theweek.com/articles/480961/15-urban-outfitters-controversies#.WKESe_krK00)

Again, you can argue that these are all examples of people being ""oversensitive,"" but the way I see it, Urban Outfitters is careless and ignorant of history AT BEST. At worst, they don't care because they're being ""edgy"" or ""ironic."""
89,"The 110th Rule of Acquisition: Exploitation Begins At Home

EDIT: I can't believe that a well-timed Trek reference earned me some Reddit gold ~~pressed latinum~~! Thanks!"
90,"That you owe anyone sex, for any reason ever. That sex is something you have to do to get people to like you, or that sex begins and ends with what the guy's dick wants. (From what I can tell, gay kids don't tend to have this idea very often.) That sex isn't supposed to be unenjoyable or unpleasant for you just because you're a woman. If you don't like something that's happening, you're allowed to speak up, and you're allowed to take your purse and go home. If something hurts, you're allowed to - you should! - seek medical attention. You're a person that matters as much as anyone you interact with, not somebody else's fuck furniture. 

More broadly, that the most important thing about your sex life is that it's ""normal,"" not that you and your partner(s) are actually having a good time. It always irks me when I see people fretting over kinks and behaviors and features not because they don't enjoy them, but because they're worried they're not ""normal."" Fuck normal."
91,"On New Years Day I told him if he hadn't kissed me 2017 times before the end of the day, we'd have to break up.  

He didn't end up getting anywhere close, but he made a valiant effort and I got like 500 kisses out of it, so I let it slide."
92,That's when you know that you did something very right in raising them.
93,"Guy found out I was Puerto Rican (I have light skin, so many people can't tell from looking at me even though I have a really spanish name) and acted totally disgusted, said he could never be with ""someone like you"" and left.

Another guy had a fetish for Hispanic women. Kept bragging about how he only dates Hispanics, saying latina's are all sexy and exotic. Tried to impress me with his knowledge of my culture but kept saying wrong things about it and acted like he was an authority. He also flirted with the mexican waitress right in front of me. It was creepy and uncomfortable as hell."
94,"I think that means you're doing a good job, for what it's worth."
95,Compared the size of my tits with those of his ex-wife. Just because something is true doesn't mean it's necessary to say.
96,"I got a phone call from an unknown number that was just crying profusely and asking me ""Where am I?"" and ""Can I talk to her?""  It sounded like it was from an older lady.

She would occasionally call back, and she was never not hysterical.  She was always asking where she was and if she could talk to someone.

She only barely responded to anything we said in any coherent way.

I think she might have been in a nursing home or something."
97,...and probably a drug dealer.  I wonder if she's giving mom a family discount or full retail.

100,"A hand written letter professing my love and how I thought it was a huge mistake. 

Since then I have learned to write these things down, but destroy them after. It is therapeutic to get it off my chest, but not for anyone else's eyes but my own. "
101,"The talk. We agreed pre-kids that he would take care of ""the talk"" if it was a boy and I would if it was a girl. We had two girls. I literally was pissed due to this when we found out the first was a girl. I almost cried when we found out the second was a girl. 

I thought the whole ""talk"" situation was going to be completely awkward and painful. I underestimated how brilliant and great my kids were going to be.

It was absolutely no big deal. We don't discuss it often but I do make sure I open up the conversation occasionally for them to ask questions and we've covered a good deal of things I thought would be too hard for me to talk about. I approach most of it from a purely scientific point of view and they have been great about asking their questions and laughing about the awkward parts and my bad jokes.

The oldests first period was totally no big deal either. She was prepared for it. I got her some chocolate, sparkling grape juice and makeup. She has handled it great. 

Really we are off to a great start to the teen years (the time that seemed most terrifying to me from the get go) and I feel like we have a great foundation set for getting us all through it.

I seriously thought I'd be crying over the growing up milestones more but I'm mostly just excited to see what they do with themselves. They are turning out to be pretty interesting people."
102,"This. No one should ever make you feel bad for waiting, or not waiting. It's an extremely personal choice and NEVER one you should feel pressured to make by others. "
103,"84 days before a 200 guest formal military- involved wedding, with 7 attendants each, my hubs and I did the unthinkable. Canceled it. Everything. Lost major  $ in deposits. I was too stressed out, my sisters and my friends were arguing, our mothers turned Bat shit insane, he is 2nd generation Marine, so obviously his dad wanted a huge show for his buddies.... etc etc etc

I threw up every hour one Saturday from the stress.  That day, we decided to give everyone the proverbial finger. We did, however. decide to take our honeymoon. After 3 days in Greece, he threw a surprise wedding with just our parents, his best friend and my closest sister. I had no idea it was happening. I woke up one morning, my dress was magically in the room, he said hey I thought we should get pictures done so that thing wasn't a complete waste. Went to the cliffs, and our 6 member wedding was there! Surprise!

So OP,  just do your thing. Often times the pre wedding activities turn out to be the most problem. 


"
104,"I feel nothing. There's nothing to deal with. I feel about it the same way I feel about his... I dunno, his music listening habits. Uneventful."
105,"I'd been suspicious for a couple months, but since he still treated me so well I figured he wouldn't be honest with me if I just straight up asked him. I hadn't really put much thought into snooping, as I'm generally against that - I figured I'd be patient, and that the truth would eventually come out. I was already emotionally checked out from the relationship anyway, but stayed with him for convenience. 

One night, I woke up at 5am having to pee. So I got up and did that, which normally would have woken up the boyfriend, but when I came back in our room, he was sawing logs. Suddenly it hit me. I can just look at his phone real quick. I just need, like, 30 seconds. He was deep sleep, facing away from the end table his phone was on. So, I grabbed it real quick. Opened his texts, nothing. Checked email, nothing. I locked the screen and put the phone down, content with my findings. My guts told me to check his apps list for any apps that might not have been on his screens. I almost walked away as that seemed a little too obsessive, then said fuck it. Why not. So I unlock his phone again, and open his apps. There it was. Kik messenger. I used kik, he didn't. We'd discussed it before. So, I open up kik. Voila! A convo with a girl. I open it up to take a quick scroll. Sexual stuff and pet names and I think even an ""I love you"". So I close kik, lock the phone, and lay back down. 

I woke him up to tell him that he needed to move, and that we were breaking up. He sleepily said, ""Why?"" I said, ""You're cheating on me, and neither of us are happy."" And that was that. He moved out two days later. "
106,"Holy crap. As a sufferer of anxiety he hit the nail on the head and it breaks my heart. I nearly teared up....I always tell my husband, some days it's good. Some *periods* it's even good- weeks at a time. I meditate, do therapy, no medication. But it's always there. Always. I'm *always* battling it, and I will be for the rest of my life.

Good for you for recognizing it and getting him help. My mom has anxiety but never got me help as a teen so I grew up thinking self-harm and full blown mental breakdowns and panic attacks were normal. They are not. I wish I knew then what I know now, I'm not *better* but my coping skills have improved hundred-fold and I don't break down anymore, I use my resources to get help when I need it (mostly :/ recognizing when I need it is still hard...). 

Anyway...not sure the point of my comment, other than it really tugged at my heartstrings. Wish you both the best of luck.           "

110,"A couple of years ago, I got a promotion and a 110% raise. I'm not technically rich, but I FEEL like I am. It's amazing. Between my 401k and my emergency savings, I have more money to my name than what I used to earn in a year. No more student loans. My car is almost paid off. And I still use all of my poor person skills to budget and plan, so I do extremely well. I'm lucky as fuck and will always be grateful for what I have.  "
111,"Things to deep clean that you might not do in a rental. In an apartment, I just Swiffer-ed and called it good. In a house I own (or have a stake in owning like the one I live in now that my husband owns), I got rags, a bucket, homemade cleaner, and do my best crackhead impression trying to clean the grout and get it ready to rent

E: this might expose my American friendliness, but... I also bake cookies and introduce myself to the neighbors right away. It pays to know who's who, and when it's 3 degrees out and your heater breaks, it's nice to be able to ask if you can go over till its fixed. When we were snowed in this last month, it was great to meal-share and look out for each other, all neighborly like"
112,"Damn, that sucks that nobody in your house taught you that, not your fault at all. I'm sure  your husband was understanding of that. Peace."
113,"Women's orgasms are just as important as men's.

Do on your own terms, and don't spend the rest of your life regretting a free, simple choice. :)"
117,"My ex girlfriend. We had sex for about 4 hours that day. We had no other cares in the world. For some reason, on like the 3rd round, I remember laying there thinking that I really was going to spend the rest of my life with her. The sun was shining through the window. I was hot, but it was cool in the room. All of it was just perfect. "
118,"We were always the ""Blank-Gynecologist"" each week. Usually we would either fill in the blank with someone or something that was relevant in the news but sometimes we would just be silly with it. My favorite was Craigslist Gynecologist."
119,She's definitely figured a lot of things out a lot earlier in life than I did.
120,"Setting: At home, Christmas Day. 

My mom and brother were going at it (again), like full on screaming and throwing stuff and just general madness for literally hours. My dad and I are much more even tempered and were totally sick of it, and he just looked at me at one point and gestured me out of the room. He was like, ""grab your coat"". We left and went to a diner to eat Christmas dinner and then we went to a movie. It was awesome, we totally just ditched them. "
121,"I underwent a pretty drastic ugly duckling transformation, I was unattractive, socially awkward and shy in high school and ""blossomed"" after graduating. 

The hardest part was not letting my self-esteem be affected by how much male attention I got. After being ignored by boys all my teens it felt good to be noticed. And then I gained weight in my third year and suddenly all the male attention I was getting vanished. "
122,"I went from butt length to bald. It was really nice and showers felt amazing though I had to put sunscreen on my head. I was not excited or terrified, was just something different. I would love to be bald again (it's back down to my waist) but I know my husband would hate it. "
123,"Couples should do whatever they decide is best for them. But my personal opinion is that, if the cost is a burden, you're already making a bad financial decision."
124,"I'm all choked up here. I broke up with my first love about 7 weeks ago and this whole time I've been so afraid that he'll be my last. Reading this was very comforting, and I'm looking forward to meeting my second love, when (and if) he ever comes. "
125,"When he does something particularly cheeky I look at him and say ""i think we should see other people"". It's a running joke in our marriage. He does the same back to me. We also never do it in anger and I honestly think if one of us ever asked for a divorce the other would think it was a joke. "
126,"That I was like a limp fish (this was near The End). Never mind that I told him I felt like sex had become really unpersonal from him and I felt like it could be anyone lying underneath him, he never said my name, looked at me, touched me or any of the things he did in the beginning. I usually ended up crying after he left the room."
127,"That's a great question! It's been five years and he still emails me periodically or messages me whenever I get on OkCupid, but he no longer tried to blackmail me and I like to call that progress.

I just don't respond. They want attention. Don't give it to him."
128,"Nursing. Good money. Job security.  If you get burned out in one specialty it's usually not an issue to switch to something completely different.  I've did geriatric care, ortho/neuro, cardiology, end of life care, and now I'm a labor and delivery nurse. Sometimes this profession sucks monkey balls, but I always feel accomplished at the end of the day. "
129,"Understand dirt. 

Dust can be easily swept off or vacuumed away.  
Dirt can be sponged off or wiped away with water.    
Grime can be scrubbed off or steam-cleaned, but it takes time and effort and strong cleaners.        
Embedded grunge has to be repainted or replaced.  
  


Walls in rentals get periodically repainted, cheap crappy wall-to-wall carpet gets replaced -- and you-the-renter don't see it because it happens between tenants. 

Now that it's yours, you want to get rid of dirt in your home as far down the evolutionary scale as you can -- or even better, keep it from coming in in the first place. 

Scrubby welcome mat outside the door, another in the mudroom, and then SHOES OFF in the house. The single greatest habit you can adapt to cut down the amount of your precious time you spend cleaning is to simply NOT WEAR OUTSIDE SHOES INSIDE. The rest of the world thinks we're NUTS for doing this in the US.  

And for what you can't avoid, get it early. Buy a lambs-wool duster and sweep the cobwebs off the walls and the dust off ANY horizontal surface -- including the top edges of wall moldings, chair rails -- once every two weeks. Start high and work low, then vacuum when you're done. 

Get a corn broom and sweep the kitchen floor every morning while your coffee is brewing. It'll take you one minute and you'll hardly EVER need to mop -- and when you do, you won't need aggressive chemicals.   

A house with clean bright trim and floors is a joy to be in -- it's like wearing a nice white shirt. It bounces the light around and energizes you. A house with grit in all the crevices, cloudiness on everything shiny, is like wearing a hoodie with old food down the front and grey edges on the cuffs. It's ok if you're doing yard work, but if you're trying to feel professional or romantic, it holds you back.  

Five minutes a day of the right actions save you BIG down the road. Treat it like the things you do for your own body -- shaving with a good razor, brushing your hair with a good brush. It'll feel really good once it's part of you.   "

132,"Wedding photographer here. Ive got two or three weddings this year with no bridal party, just the bride and groom. It seems to be a growing trend the last few years and naturally I'm okay with it because it's less work for me and puts more emphasis on the actual couple getting married. If you have none and your SO has two then that will definitely look different for sure."

136,"Meals, food, picky eating.

From the get-go my son ate what we ate. Apparently, we did ""baby led weaning"" before ""baby lead weaning"" was a thing. We just let the kid have what he wanted of whatever we were eating. ""Kid foods"" are not a thing in my house. We don't have Go-Gurt; we have plain yogurt and fresh fruit to chop up and toss in it for sweetness, for instance. My son never went through a phase of insisting he would only eat chicken nuggets for supper, or whatever, because it wasn't an option. It never occurred to him that he could whine for different food because there was no alternative food; he always ate what we ate.

When my son was 4ish a friend and her son came to visit us for a week. The kid, a few years older than my son, was a SUPER picky eater and complained about every aspect of every meal and got to have some god-awful-sugary kid-snack as a substitute. 

My son thought this was a great scam. He tried sticking with it after my friend and her son left and quickly realized that the god-awful-sugary kid-snacks had left with our friends and you can try to claim that the honey BBQ sauce on the chicken is ""too spicy"" but you aren't getting anything else to eat. He got over himself within a week.

As he's gotten older, he's got an allowance and can walk to the store and buy himself junk food. But he still eats well, enjoys good food, and keeps the junk food in moderation. He's the only 9 year old I know that gets as excited about salads and sushi as he does about pizza or ice cream."
137,"Phone call from an out of state number, I usually consider unknown numbers as spam or wrong numbers so I let it ring at first. This number though called about once a day for quite a while so I picked up. If it was a wrong number at least I could tell them that directly.... turns out despite not knowing them they WERE looking for me. ""Ah, thank god you finally picked up. Been waiting forever to hear your voice."" Like any reasonable freaked out 20 y/o I hung up. 

The guy proceeded to try and call over and over and texted ""now that I know for sure this is your number, I won't give up"". 

That number got blocked so hard, so fast."

141,"My ex boyfriend circa 7 years ago. I was riding him and it was slow passionate type vibe, and the position rubbed my clit in the right way. First and only time I've had an actual orgasm during PIV without using hands or other tools to stimulate the clit. It was a huuuuge O. Most amazing thing I've ever felt. 

7 years and I have not forgotten. RIP that relationship ;_;"
142,I love women believing and sticking up for other women.
143,"One morning when I was a teenager, my dad dragged me out of bed at 4 AM to listen to an answering machine message. 

The call was from 2 or 3 that morning, and it was just the voices of two or three teenage girls talking about masturbation, sex toys, etc. My dad stood there and made me listen to the message, then started demanding I tell him which of my friends had been on that call.

I didn't recognize any of the voices, and the girls on the phone had been talking about stuff in a way that none of my friends ever would. I kept trying to tell my dad that it wasn't anyone I knew and it had nothing to do with me, that it might even be a bully from school or something, but he kept insisting there was no way teen girls could have our number unless I was giving it out to them.

I wound up grounded for a week for the crime of being a teenager in a home that was crank called by teenagers. Still have no idea who it was, but it's not like we had an unlisted number - it could have easily been some asshole from my school, or even just a misdial."

146,"I won't say I've pulled myself out of it entirely, but one thing that helped a lot was just analyzing what, exactly, I hated about myself and then trying to change what I can. 

I found online support groups helpful -- groups that are specific to my specific issues. For example, one reason I feel self-loathing is that was programmed into me by the religious cult (it calls itself a religion but it's not) I was once a member of. So there's a support group for former members of this cult and talking to other people with similar experiences helped a lot. 

Another action I've taken has been to basically cut off all toxic relationships. Anyone who makes you feel like shit about yourself must go. Reach out, make new friends, and try to surround yourself with people who like you and will point out your positive attributes to you. (I am right now, as I type this, texting with a friend who is absolutely talking me off the ledge about a guy who isn't into me. She is not allowing me to beat myself up with a giant Self Loathing Stick®. Make more friends like that.)

Set some goals with regard to something you've always wanted to do, but maybe never had the time/inclination/motivation to try. Invest time and money into it. I'll tellya, one of the biggest things for me was I stumbled on a pole dancing/fitness studio a few years ago and was fascinated and really wanted to try it. I didn't think I'd be able to do anything and would probably just give up after a few classes but guess what happened? Even though I really sucked at first, I loved it so much that *I kept trying*. Gradually, slowly, I got better and better at it. I lost 40 pounds. Muscle definition started popping out all over my body. Eventually, I was invited to teach and became an instructor. Note: I started poling at age 40, so by the time I started teaching, I found myself in front of a wall of mirrors in a room full of young women half my age, teaching them how to bring their sexy out. Every now and then, my age would come up and it did my heart good to see the look on some women's faces when they realized I was their Mom's age. LOL 

Now I'm not suggesting you run out and become a stripper (unless you really want to do that, in which case, knock yourself out). I am suggesting that you think about your interests and focus on being the awesomest you can be in at least one area. 

Another thing that helps is to get outside of your own head. Instead of focusing on why you think you're such a piece of shit, just forget about yourself for a minute. Go volunteer or reach out to someone who is less privileged than you. Do something selfless for someone else. Tutor kids at reading at the local library. Become a Girl Scout leader. Volunteer at the battered women's shelter. Do something for someone else and expect nothing in return. You may begin to see yourself in a whole new light. 

And I would strongly recommend listening to Brene Brown's TED talks about shame and guilt. Well worth your time. "

I was texting him in class, and it turned into an argument over something stupid (...about the Elder Scrolls MMO Beta I think) anyway he dumped me over text, I ran out of the classroom crying, and then ran into traffic purposely and got hit by a car. Thankfully the car was moving slow but I nearly broke my foot and I twisted my ankle hard which took about two months to heal. I spent three weeks in a mental hospital after spending about 7 hours in the ER. I got a text from my ex, who I texted while I was in the ER  and told him. He said ""I'm glad you're not dead but never speak to me ever again"". I tried to call him and he has immediately changed his number. I got so desperate that I called his HOUSE, his mom answered and I asked to be put on with him and he refused.


I was 20 at the time. I still shudder at the whole incident. I have no idea how this plan came to my mind. I could have died if that car was moving just a bit faster."

I guess they thought I was asleep because they were talking about me starting middle school and I overheard my father saying he was very concerned how I would do because I wasn't a very attractive girl and I was overweight and would probably be made fun of.

I noped outta there super fast, and things got weird later when he started asking to move halfway across the continent and one international border to live with me.

BUT. They're not ""fuck you rich"". I think they think they're more well off than they are. At the beginning, his mother legitimately thought I was with him ""for money"". She didn't like me. This was WILDLY offensive and hilarious to me because MY SO WAS NOT WORKING. His parents supported him 100%, but that was *their* money. Not his. He used it to eat, drink, go out, etc. but he couldn't like go buy lavish things with it. He lived pretty much the exact lifestyle as me, except I was paying for mine myself. I was so offended - not that someone would think I'm with someone for money - but that she ASSUMED I was a lower class than my SO or assumed my SO was perceived as wealthy to women my age. It just blew my mind.

2. People think that Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts are two sides of the same organization and that our policies and beliefs are therefore the same. We're not connected. Their foundation is Mormonism. We're secular. "

180,"The English sentence is perfect 😊 but there's no secret to it really. I've been doing it this way for a few years now,  so the important thing is structure and consistency. Having the same routine every single night is key and trying to not let that change. Otherwise it messes up the whole system. When it gets close to bedtime, you let them know so it's not a surprise, that way they see it coming and there's no whining that they didn't get to finish what they were doing or watching, etc. For example, ""20 minutes left till bedtime...10 minutes til we need to wash up...5 minutes left...k, time to shut down!"" Bam, not one peep of complaining because mommy had been counting down and they'd known for at least 20 minutes that that was all they had left for the night. Ipads are off and they're now putting away the big mess, tv and light is being turned off where they've been playing downstairs, the older two wash up first and set out the younger two's toothbrushes. Every now and then, one of the older might whine a bit about wanting to finish doing something, but I just simply tell them I'm not having this conversation, that it's bedtime. Pure and simple. On the weekends, because the older two know it's the weekend, they ask and I do let them stay up later, til after 9pm, the younger ones too. But it's still the same routine as far as letting them know within 20 minutes of when it's time to shut down. Also, if your toddler still naps, do NOT let them nap after 3pm otherwise they will fight you to the death when you try to put them down at night! "

None of these things were offensive in themselves, and I truly don't think he was trying to be careless, but afterwards I was offended that he just didn't even try.  Worst.  Date.  Ever."
183,It's also a leftover trait from Protestant times. The Netherlands is much the same. Flaunting material wealth is considered supremely tacky.
184,"I don't know if this applies but I grew up in a Latin American household. Fortunately both my parents are highly educated and my mother works so I got plenty of support in that area. However, I was ALWAYS expected to cook and clean not just after myself but also my father and my brother, my time was also seen as disposable and available for everyone to use, and by that I mean that I was expected to do everyone small or big favors and use my time to help them while I never received the same attention or dedication. It was also much more acceptable for my brother to go outside and hang out with people and even to get a new gf every couple of months while of course that would have been unacceptable for me to do.

Even today I'm kind of perceived by my family as a maid and whenever I'm around I'm expected to arrange lunch and do the dishes while my brother can literally play video games and pick his nose. To make things worse, the men of my family are very unclean and leave amazing messes wherever they go but ""that's OK because that's how men are""."

191,"Being mindful of our technological consumption and waste due to the procurement of the minerals (coltan specifically, a cobalt/tantalum mix) needed for our microprocessors.

You know the concept of blood diamonds? We all have blood cell phones and blood laptops. Coltan mostly comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo and it's mostly mined by people under the control of war lords. The ""workers"" see very little of the profits, the war lords use rape and murder as a tool to coerce locals to work for them, it's an awful situation. 

Unfortunately there's still very little oversight or regulation of the mining and there's no way to verify where a manufacturer sources their coltan. And unfortunately we still don't have a good way to make decent microprocessors without coltan. Everything we own with one probably has problematic sourcing of minerals needed to make it.

What we can do is limit our consumption of tech so that the demand for these minerals is lessened. Stop breaking your damn phone and getting a new one every year. Don't upgrade to the newest tablet every time one comes out. Take good care of your laptops so they last you a really long time. Tell everyone you know about this and urge them to treat their technology as durable assets paid for with people's lives, not fun gadgets to casually update and discard."

202,"Ex husband cheated on me seven times. I was young though and I had a bad childhood which caused self esteem issues. We also had a kid (I still have her but he is uninterested in being a parent now so it's no longer a 'we' thing) 

First time I found out, the girl my ex was cheating on me with, called me to try and fight me for him. After that I was suspicious of everything he did so Over the course of 4 years I was constantly catching him by invading his privacy and never trusting him. I do not like what I became with him.

Going through his email, phone, Facebook. Twice he put an nice new picture in his Facebook and I ran it through google and found the same picture on dating web pages. It was toxic and horrific. I was an idiot for staying so long.

Once I went on a trip with my mom for four days and he threw a house party. All his friends on his Facebook kept calling him the ""beast slayer"" so I went through his phone and found out they were teasing him for screwing a really large girl in our bed. (As someone who has been fat in the past, I feel sick that they called her that, and I'm not trying to be mean, I'm just explaining the story.)

One time I'm made a fake dating profile on the same site I saw his at and chatted with him for like a week and got him to admit he was married. Then I said ""I don't want to be a home wrecker if you've never cheated before"" and got him to go on and on about all the times he had cheated on ""his wife"" in the past to try and convince this fake girl I was posing as, to sleep with him because he had already good and fucked up our relationship. Classy right? That's when I found out he had fucked my best friend/ college roommate, cause he bragged about it to me thinking I was some random internet girl.

Once I came home from work early and found him fucking my ex girlfriend. She was super drunk so I drove her home. She had been hanging around outside of our apartment looking for me because she was still hung up on me, so he let her in and ended up fucking her. She had been in and out of mental hospitals around that time, so I was mad at her, but it was pretty much all his fault because she was clinically insane and I had gone no contact with her two years prior (before I met my husband) because of it. 

My current husband is wonderful. He got repeatedly cheated on by his ex wife too. He and I have reeeeeallly great communication and understanding and have a 100% open policy with each other's electronics/phones/emails, but have never had to use it because we are so transparent. It was the only way either of us could learn to trust again. "

Honestly I'm legitimately embaressed for them to see my family, my home etc. My parents were neglectful and I did most of the stuff myself. I learnt French horn at 10 through my school by myself, I learnt my indigenous language by myself, hell I learnt to read in English by myself. 

His family adores him, he's an amazing older brother and I feel like shit when I compare. So I don't. My country has extreme wealth inequality and I am not at fault for that. I worked my ass to get to college, one of the best in my country for my course.

220,"Eh. Late to the party as usual. My daughter was about 20 when she talked to me about something important. She was home from college for the summer, probably year 2. It was our last few days together. We were driving most likely to the grocery store. 

Out of the blue she says she's glad we left our religion several years ago. I'm stunned because when we left said religion it was a cluster fuck. Husband was upset, kids confused. I was alone in leaving and it was hard. 

Anyway, grown daughter proceeds to tell me that she felt like she could be who she wanted for the first time in her life. She was out of the religion and had choices. I legit cried. All the years I told her she could be anything she wanted but she didn't believe it until we were out. I cried not just for her, but me too, because I understood. Because I was her. She graduated college from a very excellent university. It was the proudest day of my life. I had a daughter that believed in herself, which was my goal when she was a tiny infant 24 years ago. 

I held her back for most of her life with my weird religious belief. It was life changing for both of us. She is still the woman I aspire to be. "

222,"I was raised in a fundamentalist Christian household, which is pretty similar when it comes to its ideas about women.

I was discouraged from having career aspirations outside of traditional woman dominated fields, and it was expected of me to settle down early and be a stay at home mother at least until my children began school, at which point working during school hours would be permissible but not ideal.

I rejected my family's religion pretty early, but not going to church and trying to actually break free of the church's control ended up being two different things. 

I am a lesbian and I was terrified of being rejected by my family, so I grasped onto any slight sign that maybe I could be bisexual and just marry a man and never have to come out. 

I married a man when I was 18. Luckily he wasn't an asshole and we remain friends to this day. We have two children. 

When I was 22, I had a mental breakdown and started planning how I was going to commit suicide. I told my husband and he checked me into a mental hospital where I was diagnosed with general anxiety and bipolar disorder.

 I realized around that time that the only way I could possibly be happy was to come out, but it was a few months before I got up the courage to do it. 

It has been a few years, and I am doing much better now. I have limited contact with my family because they don't accept me, but honestly I am over it. "
223,"Sex drives vary and that's fine. Some women are horny 24/7. Some want sex once or twice a week. Some once a month. Some less. As long as you find a partner with similar needs, there is no ""right"" amount of sex one should have.

Also, SEX IS NOT JUST PIV. I can't stress that enough. We're so conditioned to think sex is penis in vagina. "

Nothing creepy about that). I answered assuming she'd let me know to not come to lecture the next morning. Instead it sounded like static, crackling and such, then suddenly the sound of what could only have been a barbershop quartet began to sing. I don't remember the song except that it talked about your face shining so bright and I can't wait to hold you tonight, or something. It was horrifying. I screamed and hung up the phone fast. I asked the professor the next day and there was no log in her phone that she ever called me. "

I don't know much about Aspergers, but apparently hyper-focus on a subject is a common trait. Her interests were always in things that they had zero knowledge of, so to them it probably just looked like nonsense.

For a quick background on me, I've been working IT for over 15 years. I've done computer programming, systems administration, and manage a team that works with six manufacturers around the globe. 

I know that comes off as /r/iamverysmart, but the point is, this kid at 13 years old had me stumped on some of the stuff she was doing with computers. Sometimes I would bring up technical problems I was having at my not-weekend job and she would offer up legitimate advice and possible solutions.

She's really, really naive now, and literally doesn't understand when someone hits on her. Like last week: she had a stranger offer to smoke with him and she was telling me how nice it was of him to offer free weed. Or another couple times when guys call her beautiful and gorgeous and all of these compliments: she doesn't realize they mean they're interested in her. 

So naivety is a biggy. "

It's really a great combination of creativity and science.

They described what I was wearing and told me to come outside and they had a gift for me. I freaked the fuck out and closed the blinds, my roommate, who had been chilling on the couch on her computer the whole time, was freaking out too.

After I was able to scrape my jaw off the floor I then cut HER off with cussing (holy crap I don't cuss my parents EVER), disbelief, a lite version of our family medical history and her personal medical history and admonished her parenting for trying to suggest that I am foolish for failing to neglect my own healthcare.

She did end up going to a OBGYN soon afterwords and had cysts the size of softballs on her uterus. She was taken from her doctors office to the hospital for an emergency hysterectomy. She's MUCH less crazy now.. makes me wonder what my life would have been like if she had taken care of herself? "

Can you expand on why this is a reality for you? 30, to me, seems really pretty young, since people tend to date for shorter time frames before marriage/ children in their 30's. IIRC, advanced maternal age doesn't really start until 35, longer if the woman is healthy. In any case, I admire that you're realistic about your lives with your BF, and hope that it all works out well "

Pretty embarrassing now that I think about it in hindsight. I think it's also one of the benefits of going no contact. Not only was it a relief to not have to worry about being reminded of him constantly or being tempted to reach out, but it was liberating to finally feel like I was doing things for myself, not as some sort of ""fuck you"" to him.

Even after she said she wanted to continue the pregnancy, they got out some fetus diagrams to show her with extra emphasis on heartbeats. She asked for help finding resources (she wanted help with WIC and health insurance for the baby and about affordable housing and support to continue getting her associate degree) and they said they could give her some diapers sometimes and some used baby clothes, so not exactly what she needed.

I hate that they trick women and really they are like an understocked food pantry that only has baby stuff and to get it you have to be preached at about abstinence and get inaccurate medical information from non medical professionals and get told about the evils of abortion (and sometimes birth control).

I think more support for teen and young moms who decide to keep their child is important but DECIDE is key. Abortion is her choice. And help isn't throwing some old baby clothes at her and telling her to not have sex until marriage."
284,"My favorite memory is as an adult. It was a few years back, I was 24 or 25. I was in the process of getting a divorce and in order to sell the house I needed to renovate.

He comes in and sees me on the floor and lays down next to me. I start crying and lean on his shoulder and say ""this isn't how I thought it would be, this isn't what I thought my life would be, this isn't what I planned"" and he just kisses my forehead and says ""I know, I know, it'll be okay, we'll get through it"".

288,"This comment from a deleted reddit user is like my favorite summary of South Park:

&gt;Yeah, and Manbearpig was almost ten years ago. What an idiot Al Gore was to think climate change was real.
&gt;
&gt;South Park has always been fundamentally reactionary; those pushing for change are wrong no matter what change they push for. Nothing is a bigger crime to Matt and Trey than Giving a Shit. Their ideology is apathetic-libertarian; whether you're on the left or the right, if you're asking me to change my behavior, you suck.
&gt;
&gt;As it stands, the political left tends to push for more change than the political right does; as it stands, Matt and Trey admit they dislike conservatives and ""really fucking hate"" liberals. It isn't about left or right; it's about change versus comfort. If you're trying to change something, they think you're annoying. And they think you're lame, because caring about stuff is lame.
&gt;
&gt;It's the same attitude that establishes ""u mad"" and ""butthurt"" as the ultimate trump cards in internet arguments: caring is for losers, and if you become personally invested in politics you're part of the problem. Uncritical, detached acceptance of the status quo is the only morally upright posture, and those who draw a distinction between is and ought are all smug bullies, outlandish freaks, and/or closed-minded zealots.
&gt;
&gt;It's a show that teaches its audience to become lazy and self-satisfied, that praises them for being uncritically accepting of their own biases, and that provides them with an endless buffet of thought-terminating cliches suitable for shutting down all manner of challenges to their comfort zones.
&gt;
&gt;South Park is a place where you never have to have your assumptions challenged. It's a place where you're always right, you shouldn't bother to think, and the people asking you to change your mind are annoying busybodies and prigs who should just shut up and leave you alone.

I had no idea what he was trying to achieve with that throwaway comment, but I never went on a date with him again. 

A few weeks later, he sent me some really pissy emails about how upset he was with me that I didn't ever call him after the date, which he felt I owed him (since he'd done all the driving for our date). But it's not like he'd contacted *me*, either. I'd figured the distaste was mutual and that the date had been a bust for both of us; passive aggressive snarks are usually a pretty clear indicator that you don't like someone.

The first time I fell in love, I had nothing to compare it to besides what I had seen on TV and previous crushes. Nothing real. Now that I have that experience, I can better differentiate red flags and future concerns. I have a little baggage from my last ex.

That said, it hasn't stopped me from loving this new person. If anything, the more I found out about him and the more that wasn't concerning (as in, similar to my ex), the more I liked him. On our first real date, we could not stop kissing and saying, ""you know, I really like you."" It was non-stop conversation, laughter, and excitement. It still is and it's been three years. He's my absolute best friend. 

Tonight, we went to our favorite restaurant. We got drinks and apps and food and just talked. We had a competition over which drink was better, we made fun of each other, we ranted about stupid things on TV. This love is an experienced love. I know what a first love is and this is so much better. We are so much more compatible.

They saw me as 'out of action' for the period, and couldn't understand why I'd signed up to a dating site. But for me, I felt like I was young and missing out on what was a normal part of my life. 

My friends, and the guy I met on the site took it perfectly in stride though. My friends still see me as the person I was. My date felt like the cancer/baldness/scars were a total non-issue, and didn't negate any attraction to me. "

So obviously while on the train I had taken lots of photos, because the scenery was incredible. We had never been west of Iowa before this, so this really was a trip of a lifetime for us. 

A few months after we had gotten back, Amtrak had this ""Amtrak All the Way"" contest on Instagram, where you could use the hashtag on your best Amtrak photos for a chance to win a free trip. I figured it was worth a shot-I had some good images, but mine were all taken with my iPhone. There were hundreds of incredibly outstanding photos, that were clearly taken with high quality cameras. You can imagine the look on my face when I found out I won! It was a total shot in the dark and I was definitely not expecting that. 

I used the winnings to take another trip with my dad, out east this time. It was fun, but noting compares to that trip out west.

324,"Well, a lot of it is very personal. I was in the sex industry for a long time - stripping, escorting, camming, etc. I never did porn, but I knew a *lot* of women who did. The sex industry in general is extremely exploitative, misogynistic, and dangerous. Porn is arguably the worst about it. If I started listing the kind of abuses that are commonplace, it would take up this whole post. On Shelly Lubben's website, she collects testimony from current and former porn stars. It's pretty horrible, and I can confirm that everything mentioned in those stories is incredibly common. She's a Christian and a lot of the stories end with the women finding God, but don't let that put you off. I don't blame these women for trying to find peace in religion. They were traumatized. If you're not interested in religiously-motivated testimony, then you can focus on two case studies: Linda ""Lovelace"" Boreman and Sasha Grey. Neither of their stories are particularly unique. The whole ""an abusive partner pushed me into porn"" thing is true more often than not. It's what happened to me.

And because I was in the sex industry, I got up close and personal with the kind of men who purchase sexual services. I... don't think very highly of them, to put it mildly. I know that not all men who watch porn go to strip clubs or hire prostitutes. But most men who watch porn enjoy camgirls. Even if they don't pay for them, they're happy to watch their stolen videos. [Porn users are statistically more likely to buy sex.](http://fightthenewdrug.org/how-porn-warps-ideas-about-sex/) And ALL men who go to strip clubs or hire prostitutes watch porn. So the line is too blurry for me to be comfortable with it. 

Not all of my reasoning is personal, though. [There is a ton of evidence that porn watching is strongly correlated with an increase in sexism and sexual violence](http://fightthenewdrug.org/how-watching-porn-can-lead-to-violence/), as well as attitudes that support or excuse that kind of behavior. [They're also likely to want more violent and degrading sex, because they want to act out what they saw in porn](http://fightthenewdrug.org/how-porn-affects-your-sexual-tastes/). The famous line is, ""pornography is the theory, rape is the practice."" You can also look to the fact that most serial killers (Jeffrey Dahmer and BTK among them) name pornography as an influence. 

A lot of people who disagree will argue that it's like saying that playing video games makes people violent, that fantasy isn't reality and people know the difference. But you have to realize that the psychology involved is very different. Everyone knows about Pavlov's dogs - if you associate one neutral stimulus with another, positive stimulus, eventually the neutral stimulus will elicit the same response as the positive one. An orgasm is an extremely powerful positive stimulus. Anything that you regularly associate with orgasms will eventually become sexy to you. This becomes a particular problem because [porn watching escalates](http://fightthenewdrug.org/why-watching-porn-is-an-escalating-behavior/). 

Porn in the context of a relationship is generally just a terrible thing. After watching porn, many men rate themselves as less ""in love"" with their partner. Speaking anecdotally, the difference between sex with a man who doesn't watch porn and a man who does is incredible. But it's not just anecdotal. [Men who watch porn are more likely to be disappointed with their partner's looks and sexual performance.](http://fightthenewdrug.org/how-porn-can-hurt-your-partner/) For example, the ""shaved pussy"" thing is entirely due to porn. [It's actually pretty unhealthy for women to be bare down there](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjM8ufA4ZPSAhWE5CYKHUR-B58QFgghMAE&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thehealthsite.com%2Fdiseases-conditions%2Fwhy-shaving-your-vagina-or-pubic-hair-is-not-a-good-idea-d1215%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNEmtZxChaXJprf6tPzEXwQd2PUGDQ&amp;sig2=FPRlfM2itBFV_R31psRt6Q&amp;bvm=bv.147134024,d.eWE), which is, y'know, *why* there is hair down there. Porn watchers are also likely to be worse in bed. They're mimicking what they see in porn, which rarely, if ever, has anything to do with real female pleasure (like anal, which only a small fraction of women enjoy). And when you don't respond like a porn star, they assume that it's something wrong with *you.* Furthermore, they're more likely to be self-conscious in bed (porn has a lot to do with size anxiety), which can also make a sexual encounter unpleasant.

Porn watching ends up being bad for women worldwide. [As this article explains](http://fightthenewdrug.org/the-porn-industrys-dark-secrets/), porn feeds the demand for prostitution, and vice versa. Most women in prostitution are victims of sex trafficking. Some of them are victims of global trafficking cartels. Some of them are more local, and their trafficker is just a local pimp or gang. Women like me, who """"""chose"""""" to go into the industry (at least compared to these women -  while leaving an abusive relationship is dangerous, I wasn't likely to be tracked down by thugs and murdered) are the minority by far. It doesn't seem that way if you're not looking for it, though, because ours are the only voices you hear. Victims of sex trafficking can't exactly speak up. Again, I don't hold it against a guy if he doesn't know this. But if, after learning this, he refuses to stop watching, that tells me a lot about his personality (namely, that he values his orgasms over the lives of women and girls worldwide) and I am no longer interested.

But even if a guy won't stop watching porn for anyone else, porn watching is bad for *him.* [Porn can be highly addictive](http://fightthenewdrug.org/how-porn-can-become-addictive/). Even without the science to back it up, men know this. That's why /r/NoFap is even a thing. Those men have learned on their own what science is beginning to prove: that porn is addictive, and that addiction can harm your life, your productivity, your happiness, and your relationships. [The more someone looks at porn, the more significant these effects can be](http://fightthenewdrug.org/how-porn-changes-the-brain/). And maybe this doesn't happen to all men who watch porn. But they're walking a razor's edge, gambling with their health and happiness, and the odds are against them. Also, even if they're not addicted, everything I mentioned above about sexual violence and relationships still applies.

I know I mostly linked to one website, and that may seem suspicious. Especially since it's a website clearly designed to ""push an agenda."" But everything on that website is sourced extensively. If, 50 years ago, I gave you a well-researched book explaining why smoking is bad for you, it would seem just as biased, but it wouldn't make it any less true. But you don't have to take my word for it. I recommend doing your own research and coming to your own conclusions. I did my own research. I lived it, then I found the science that explained why my experiences were what they were, and arguments to the contrary seemed very weak. I just can't find anything good about porn. So I don't support it and I don't date people who do.

EDIT: Thanks for the gold! I'm really glad this is resonating with people."
325,"I must've been an especially stupid kid... I was 3 and a family friend was changing their baby son's diaper, and I told them, ""You missed one!!"" And the family friend told me, no, this is a baby boy, so he has that. I laughed because I thought that meant boys have poop hanging out their butts all the time, then promptly forgot about it until sex ed classes in 6th grade."
326,"She forced me to be her friend after I told her I'm the type of person who walks the other direction if I see someone I know in public. She asked ""you'd do that to me?"" all upset and I said ""totally would."" Then she made it her mission to be my best friend. It worked. She's great. "
327,"Yep, in fact you were seen as broken or a liar (about being a virgin) if you didn't bleed. My own mom even told me that my first time would be extremely painful and that I would likely bleed everywhere. "
328,"I watch way more, and way more extreme, porn than he ever does. I have no problem with him watching it. I can't expect to be his fantasy 100% of the time. Heck, the amount of time I spend thinking about Aaron Taylor-Johnson is a bit alarming."
329,"Hey, that's better than him lying to one of the girls, heh."
330,"It is not ""gross"" or ""unlady-like"" to be aroused nor is it wrong to masturbate. Until I turned 18 and moved away from my small hick town/away from the catholic school system that I realized that it is not only perfectly normal for women to masturbate but it is also fun. 

Also, you are *not* a ""slut"" if you enjoy sex. I now truly believe that no one is a slut, regardless if you're a man or woman. No one should be shamed for enjoying consensual sex that they actually want to have. The word ""slut"" doesn't address unsafe sex or ""homewrecking"" either...it simply exists to shame people (especially women) who enjoy sex, and calls them amoral for enjoying it. If a woman is unsafe with sex (doesn't use protection/contraceptives/get tested/etc) or actively tries to break up relationships then they are either irresponsible, reckless, or a horrible person. But it still doesn't make them a ""slut"". 

Lastly, I want to add (as someone who went to elementary and middle school in the catholic system) that your body isn't hyper-sexual by default just because you have breasts, a bum/hips, arms, legs, shoulders, or really any other body part of yours that people like to shame you for owning as a woman. You are not ""dirty"" or ""oversexual"" for exposing cleavage or your shoulders. And it is certainly not your fault if some random guy becomes turned on by your body when you are not choosing to portray it as such. You, and only you, get to decide when you want your body to be something that is labelled as ""sexual"". Just because you wear shorts and a crop top on a hot day (or really, any reason for that matter) it does not mean that you are ""asking for"" sexual comments to be shouted at you. "
331,"Aw, that's nice that you gave your daughter a period present! My mom just told me, ""Welcome to the real world"" lol"
332,"I was raised in an emotionally abusive home by a very warped Christian mother. 

Basically I was told men will never buy the cow if they're getting the milk.  That if I left the house in certain clothes ( I was a fat kid but had big boobs as a teenager, nothing could minimize them but apparently I was showing them off on purpose)
I would be raped and it would be my fault.  That men didn't want slutty girls and having a lot of partners meant I would lose my worth. 
Men were never responsible for their behaviour,  because it was just the way men were. I was told  men would look at me and touch me and I'd just have to deal with it because being a woman meant leading a man on.
I was constantly pressured to drop out of high school and have a baby and get married. She wanted me to go to her church and meet a nice Christian boy so I could settle down with a bunch of kids.  I was meant to be a prude but God forbid I stop letting my husband have sex with me (emphasis on my passivity) because then he'd leave me and it'd be my fault. 

Women being emotional and irresponsible was hammered into my head.  The only way to survive was with a man to provide for you and control every aspect of your life apart from the parts my mother wanted to control.  

It gave me some very confusing and messed up ideas about men and led to me dating massive assholes because I thought good men didn't exist. "

354,"I feel very passionate about changing the perception of the general population on people with mental illness. I have experienced intense and crushing depression. I wrote my masters thesis on how books and stories of people with mental illness can lessen the stigma that society imposes on people with mental illnesses.

The stigma people with anxiety and depression suffer from is so severe and acts as one of the largest barriers to care because people are so fearful of how others will view them. People still think it is about bucking up and getting over it. Or they think people with a mental illness are harmful/destructive. We are all people. And we all deserve empathy and understanding."
