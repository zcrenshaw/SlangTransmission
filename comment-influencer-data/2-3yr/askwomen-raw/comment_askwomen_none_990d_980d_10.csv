0,"First pic is a group shot.

Second pic is artfully out of focus.

Third pic is him far away.

Fourth pic is his dog.

Fifth pic is an action shot where you can't actually see what he looks like.

Bonus points if he's wearing sunglasses in every picture. Dudes, you can have awesome friends, a super cute dog, and a crazy interesting adventurous life - but unless I can assess *what you look like* all of that is irrelevant."
1,Amazon.
2,"My son is 11. I kind of expected the rough and tumble aspects. But I didn't expect how much he loves me. Like, we have always been so tight, and he almost idolizes me- that's how much he loves me. It's pretty damn amazing."
3,"There is a picture of a smiling catfish that he dislikes so much. Whenever I have access to his laptop or phone I switch his wallpaper and lock screen to that fish. All I hear is ""God dammit omnomluchis! You and that stupid fish!"" Cracks me up everytime!"
4,"Bios that tell what the girls should/shouldn´t be like.


""don´t swipe if you don´t start the conversation"", ""don´t think math is lame"" and so on and so on. Like dude, you are just putting out a negative vibe, so even if I agree with you statement, I´m still gonna swipe left cause I think you are a jerk."
5,The more I read about babies the more I'm certain that I know absolutely nothing about babies. 
6,How she would start to look like me and I find her so adorable. Yet I'm so negative about my appearance. I don't want her to grow up thinking she's not beautiful. 
7,"Costco. It has bulk food (some of which could last a while) for home, appliances,  electronics like computers, games, and other things for around the house."
8,"Every once in awhile I'll come across the scorned man whose bio reads something like:


""Don't know why I'm even using this app. Looking for someone LOYAL. Most of y'all on here are sluts anyway. I'm tired of being screwed over by everyone!!!1! I'm a nice guy just looking for someone who isn't gonna sleep around and and be a whore."" 


LOL yeah dude none of that makes me want to swipe right on you. "
9,This is the first time in my life I haven't lived paycheck to paycheck. Little things like getting my dad a nice bottle of scotch for Christmas or picking up the tab for dinner when an out of town friend visited all feel amazing. Those are my favorite puchases.
10,[The posts about depression at Hyperbole And A Half](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2011/10/adventures-in-depression.html?m=1) were the most accurate descriptions I've ever seen. They've been useful in explaining depression to those without for me. 
11,"*Take care of your face!!* No tanning, moisturize, wear makeup/moisturizer with sunblock. By the time you really realize the damage that's been done cumulatively, it's usually too late.

I know some 50 yo women who took care of their skin and they look like they're in their early 30s. All because they purposely took care of their face and kept it from toxic exposures."
12,"Mine is only two weeks old, so I'm looking forward to this thread immensely. 

One thing that has surprised me so far: did you know newborn girls can get tiny baby periods? I freaked out finding small amounts of blood in her diaper, but apparently the hormones from birth can get into their systems and cause a miniature period in the first few days of life. "
13,"Lol my time to shine: 

My ex ""gifted"" me Tester bottles of lotion and chapstick and stuff that he stole. He tried to arrange it as a gift basket, too. He never took the red TESTER stickers off though."
14,"http://m.imgur.com/gallery/HM6iPkm

It was on the front page a long time ago and I fell in love with the fish!"
15,"He can't do worse than what my SO did.  End of date, I walk him to the door, he asks, ""Can I kiss you?"" I say yes.  He leans in, our lips barely touch, he yanks away and goes ""I'm too tired for this"" and leaves without another word.



We are now married.  I assumed he was just awkward as hell.  Following dates confirmed.  But it was super endearing."
16,"Not something that I personally paid for, but I convinced my boss to get everyone dual monitors. I found it insanely hard to work with just one because I was used to two at my old job. Now he's a convert. He's always going on about how great it is. ""Look, I can open this e-mail over there, and I can reference this PDF over here. Crazy!!"""
17,"I have four sons.  They defy every boy stereotype.  Over the course of their growing they have like tea parties as much as climbing trees,  are as tender hearted as they are tough.  I am the Queen of the House.  The main surprise was just how sweet they are. The most beautiful bouquets I have ever received have been the dandelions and clover ones brought to me by my sons.  

It was more people's reaction to my having four sons that was the surprise.  Sometimes, upon learning this folks will gasp in mock surprise and say things like ""Poor You!""  or ""I bet you never have a clean house!"".  The last kid was a happy surprise baby when I was 46 and I had several jerks accuse me of trying for a girl.  Believe me, we were not trying.  All indications for years had been we were finished.  I am thrilled to be the mother of boys.  I just hope they have good lives filled with love and peace. "
18,I used to give little love bites to my ex. Used to because I once bit a stranger in a shoe store. Stopped doing that immediately. 
19,"A friend of mine on an MMO went crazy in game.  He would be upset if I got on and did not immediately message him, drop my group instantly if he wanted to join up with me, constantly pushing to voice chat, and other BS.

So, I started avoiding him.  It all got worse and worse.  Eventually, I blocked him.  He would create new characters and harass me still.  Block those and he would get other people to pass me messages.

I stopped playing altogether, and he got my phone number from a friend online and started calling me.  I started screening my calls, so he left long rambling messages about how much he hated how mean I was for not giving him a chance and how much a ladydog I was and he loved me so much and....Yeah.  Hours of this.

I changed my number and dropped all my online friends.  Nothing happens for months.

Then he fucking shows up at my apartment complex and waits in the parking lot to find out my Apt number.  He then chases me in parking lot with a silver rose begging me to take him back.  I locked myself in the Apt and told him I was calling the cops.

Before I did, though, my roommate tried to come in and he attacked her and tried to push his way in the door.  I came after him with a knife and he left.  I then managed to get her inside and called the police.  He got arrested, pled guilty, and I never saw him again.  He has sent me a few letters through a lawyer in the years since, but I have never opened them."
20,"Whenever they needed/wanted it. If my kid trusts me enough to come to me with that, I'm not going to say no. Teenagers are going to have sex whether or not you want them to so I might as well let them be as safe as possible."
21,"Sarah Jessica Parker

She may not be gorgeous, but do we have to be so mean? "
22,"Puberty is killing me. Mine's almost 13 and I am SO not ready for him to

A)Be taller than me (which he very nearly is now)

B) Have hair *everywhere*--granted he's always been on the fuzzy side because hey, he takes after his mama who resembles Koko the Gorilla if I don't maintain things but holy CRAP. He is far hairier than I expected he would be and I was shocked the first time he came to me about a year ago and went ""Hey mom look, I've got armpit hair! Cool, right?"" 

C)his voice changing..it's cracking all over the place and I regret not making more videos when he was younger because I'm struggling to remember what his little kid voice sounded like. :(

D)oh god the mood swings. "
23,"I was 100% certain that all kosher foods were blessed by a rabbi in the factory, so like the kosher hotdogs were blessed by a rabbi who got paid to stand at an assembly line and bless them individually or in batches."
24,"- All the fish pics
- ""I don't know what to put here so just ask""
- Bathroom selfies with the world's messiest countertop
- Blank bios

25,"My girlfriend is autistic and schizophrenic so she has some weird ticks. One of them is that if someone says banana she has to say ""banana banana banana"". So I'll just go back and forth with her a few times. "
26,"Stick my finger in his mouth when he's yawning, he gets super annoyed and I get a laugh. I don't ruin all of his yawns, only some. "
27,"Back when my husband and I first got married, we were constantly barraged with, ""So... when are you going to have kids?"" Then we actually did have troubles conceiving so it got harder and harder to hear the constant questions. 

Finally, ""Well, we would have kids if he could just figure out what hole to stick it in."" Shuts 'em right up. "
28,"""just ask"" 

""i'm not good at writing bios""

""don't swipe me if you're going to want to talk forever""

29,"In Sweden we have this thing called ""midsommarafton"" and it means midsummers eve. And on that day we eat fancy food (almost the same things we eat on christmas eve, except for the ham) and we also eat smörgåstårta, which is a kind of foody cake that is made from stackng bread and we fill it with mayonaise and shrimp, and salmon, and ham, and eggs, and a bunch of stuff. Then we dance around a midsummers pole which looks like big penis (its supppsed to fertilize the earth) that we dress in flowers. And as we dance around the penis pole we sing songs about us being small frogs (i have no idea and we even pretend to be frogs as we sing this). Then we drink snaps and sing snaps songs (its just a short song you sing before you take the shot) and we get terribly drunk. Then for the next few days we just eat a lot of left over smörgåstårta!"
30,"When he's lying down, I do ""CPR"" on him. I'll just suddenly yell ""don't you die on me!"" and start pushing on his chest and then blow air into his mouth.

I don't do it as much as I used to because he started doing it to me back, but I still giggle every time I think about it. "
31,"I thought puberty started and ended on your 13th birthday, since all the textbooks said something like ""it happens around the age of 13.""

The way I imagined it, you'd go to sleep as normal as a 12-year-old and then wake up on your 13th birthday with either a large set of boobs, body hair, and your period, or the ability to get an erection and body hair and a deep voice. Not to mention the acne.

I wondered what would happen if you stayed up all night--would the boobs come in anyway or did you have to be asleep for them to appear? "
32,"How often my 10 month old wants to grab on to her vagina. If she's getting her diaper changed or is in the tub, she's grabbing away at it, but not looking at it or checking it out, just feeling. Probably because it's always covered up and the skin feels more delicate? I don't know.

Either way, she does this as soon as you have her diaper off to change it. My husband told her to ""quit grabbing her Johnson"" a few months ago in a joking manner. I reminded him that she didn't have one; she's a lady. He paused, then hollered, ""Quit grabbing your Lady Bird Johnson!"" So now we crack jokes about grabbing her Lady Bird Johnson all of the time.

And we always swore we'd never use nicknames for body parts...

Edit: I'd like to clarify that we do use proper terms and call it a vagina for the most part, (because that's what it is!) but sometimes joke around in calling it a ""Lady Bird Johnson."" We also don't ever plan to discourage her from exploration - especially at such a young age, she has very little clue what she's doing now - but I do want to make sure she knows when and where it's appropriate to do so. "
33,"So to start off, I live in Sweden so I think we have some different things from what popular in the US. 

We have an expressions that's called svärmorsdröm, wich means, a mother in law's dream. There are soooo many juys who doesn't write anything except for that. 

Then we have the guys who just write their height and nothing else. 

Then we have the guys who just post photos of their abs

And the guys who have a bunch of group pictures and then ski pictures wearing full ski gear so you can't see their face.

And then when they just write down the town they live in... It's like.. yeah.. we live in the same town.. Yay, we have something in common...?

"
34,"I ask him, ""What?""  repeatedly until he realizes that I'm screwing with him. "
35,"I would appreciate not kissing on a first date.  My current bf hugged me on our first date, that was nice. "
36,"Currently staying up way past bedtime because my brother asked if I could be on call to get him from the bar. 

I was ready to sleep well before midnight, New Year's or not, but he's in a rough patch now and deserves some time with his friends. "
37,"A ROOMBA!

Fuck you, 4 cats! Your litter and floating balls of fur are no match for our trusty Woodhouse!

Sure, he gets stuck under cabinets and in the corners of throw rugs sometimes, but I'll be damned if I have to vacuum more than once a week, now.  "
38,"""If you don't look like your pictures, you're buying me drinks until you do.""

SO FUCKING ORIGINAL, BRO."
39,"To take care of the teeth - floss, brush, mouthwash. The whole shebang. "
40,"""just seeing what this is about""

""I don't know what to put here. If you want to know, just ask.""

""I like to laugh/have fun""

Apparently most guys who make an effort to write a profile love to cook, travel, and enjoy going out as much as quiet nights in. 

The lack of profile really irks me, but so does lack of originality.     "
41,"Uh, leave. I'm all for using toys during sex but...

a.) I don't want to be sexually involved with anyone whose idea of communication is to pull out a bag of dildos without any discussion 

b.) why do you have a *bag of dildos?* Are they all new? If yes - whyyyy? If no - why do you think it's okay to use pre-used penetrative toys in a new relationship? 

c.) it would just be too weird"
42,"My mother is pro at shit gifts:


I'm very lactose intolerant and she got me a chocolate fountain.


I did all the cooking in our house because my mother is terrible at cooking so she got me a 'Anyone can learn to cook in 24hrs' cookbook.


The biggest slap in the face was probably when she got me one of those microwavable hotwater bottle things because 'you've always complained so much about your period pain'.

I don't even own a microwave and I have Endometriosis, which my mother always downplayed and ignored. I'm having surgery soon because of how bad my adhesions are and my chronic pain.



Fuck you, mum."
43,"Exactly how far he can pee while I'm trying to change a diaper. I had a girl first and I knew it would be different, but good lord.  My serious answer would be how closely he bonded with his sister. Even at their young ages (3 and 5), they're very different people but they find a way to play and enjoy each other's company. Who knows how long that will actually last, but for now it's very sweet. "
44,[deleted]
45,"Kristen Stewart honestly, she gets shit on so much for her personality and I don't think people understand that even actors can have social anxiety, or be awkward or more on the shy side. She seems like a pretty cool person to me."
46,"First episode of Mr. Robot when he's crying and he says that his crying episodes have been happening weekly then says ""What do normal people do when they get this sad? Turn to family and friends?"" 
Also in that episode when he's standing outside of a bar wanting to go in because it's his friend's birthday but he can't bring himself to go inside because he's overcome with anxiety and can't get himself to socialize. 
Really struck a chord with me. 
The whole series is a very fresh and realistic depiction of anxiety and depression. "
47,I poke him on the sides because it makes him squeak like a cute little mouse and he hates it
48,"I didn't cook the fancy Christmas dinner I had carefully planned and shopped for. My boyfriend was shitting like crazy and his tummy wasn't happy with anything. It didn't seem right to have a 1-person feast.

I waited until he flew back home and *then* had a 1-person feast! &gt;:D"
49,"I agree with the gist of /u/kjk25 no negativity. 

Don't say ""don't contact me if you're fat."" (Yep, seen that!) Instead say ""I enjoy being active and appreciate that trait in a woman as well"" or ""if you can run a 7 minute mile hit me up."""
50,TIL that kosher food isn't blessed by a rabbi. Because I seriously though so as well.
51,"My ex hit and choked me. But what was probably more psycho, to me, is what triggered that incident. 

I came home from work and he asked me to read over something he had written. So I sat down to read.

It was a two-page screed, in an email addressed to my boss, saying that I was cheating with one of my coworkers (I wasn't), that I was unstable and crazy. It went on for two pages of stuff about how basically I was an evil person sleeping with coworkers. 

""So, is it good?"" he asked. ""I'm going to send it then.""

Basically, my ex resented my job and wanted me to quit. I refused because it was my dream job. So he wanted to get me fired.

I begged him not to send it and in an act of desperation grabbed his computer mouse (his finger was hovering). That's when he hit me, shoved me into the couch and choked me. 

It wasn't the only time he tried to spring a blackmail thing like that on me. The previous time he was successful."
52,"it wasn't really the gift so much as the context. when I was 11 I got pyjamas from my mom for christmas and my little brother got a ps3 from her. and it's not even like it was super nice, fancy pyjamas either, it was some 5 dollar junk from our country's equivalent of wallmart. I'm 21 now and I'm *still* bitter about it"
53,"My great-grandfather was a diplomat to Mexico, so my nana was raised there. I had abuelos and abuelas, tios and tias, and we had authentic Mexican food and mariachis at most events. We all spoke Spanish. I found out I was all white when I was told I wasn't going to have a quinceañera. (I was also very tan from being on the swim team and several people in school thought I was hispanic as well)."
54,The more I read about babies the more relieved I am that I'm not having one.
55,[deleted]
56,"I hand her things she doesn't need. Her phone. The remote. Something like that. Occasionally I do it in a rush like she really needs to take it so I can do something else, because her muscle memory is to take it then process why she needs it."
57,"The one that springs immediately to mind is American Beauty for the mother with depression. Rather than being 'sad', she's just 'not there', moving like an automaton etc. I thought the scene where she smiles and politely apologises for ""the mess"" within a perfectly spotless house was bang on for that feeling of floaty dissociation where you politely go through the motions of conversation."
58,"That I'd enjoy having a boy as much as I do! I'm a girly girl and was hoping for a girl when I was a pregnant. I was (shamefully) upset when I found out it was a boy.

Now? All I want is boys. The mother/son bond is real. "
59,"My husband does more silly things to me than I do to him.

He always does the ""guess what? Chicken butt!"" to me, and I always fall for it because I'm bad at pattern recognition. Every time I'm like ""I thought you were really going to tell me something this time!""

We used to try to ""inflate"" each other by blowing into each other's mouth while kissing. "
60,"This is an old photo, but [this](https://imgur.com/a/1T1lr) stands out. She sat like this for half an hour....?"
61,"This is really only awkward because of the reaction, but I wandered out for a glass of water in the middle of the night to find our gigantic Maine Coon cat hunched over the dog's favourite toy in his mouth. We stood and looked at each other for a long moment, and he slowly spit the toy out and backed away from it. It's one of those moments that would, if we were both people, end with ""and we never spoke of it again""."
62,"Bluetooth earphones. Made working out a lot easier - no wires to get caught up. 
Either that or my kitten Ron because he's adorable. Here he is, sleeping on a pile of laundry.

63,Dual monitors should seriously be standard for everyone in an office.
64,"Robin Williams is probably the only one that really got to me. I'm not into celebrities and don't keep up with the media, but that one really hit home. "
65,"&gt;""[height] because apparently that's important""

To be fair I seen a lot of women in their uh bio's say the guy must be 6'+ tall or that taller than them.  So i wager its because of that.  "
66,"LOL these were always my favorite. Like, THANK YOU for putting your crazy out there for me to see right away. Saved me so much time. "
67,"Dude, if that's how you were raised, I kind of think you should have had a quinceañera. Like, can you start a gofundme for a cupcake dress? because I will chip in. "
68,"My cat has this one toy that he's had since he was a kitten, but he never plays with it when anyone is looking.  As far as he is concerned, it just magically moves around my apartment during the day while I'm at work.  One day I was off and I heard some weird meowing coming from my room so I went to investigate.  I turned on the light and saw him playing with it, and he had this ""Oh shit!"" look on his face.  He immediately jumped up and walked away, like ""no I was not playing with that stupid toy, I never play with that!""  "
69,Weird dating rules.  You rarely hear of guys being forbidden to date until they are a certain age...but it is common for girls to have dating restrictions.  
70,"My best friend's husband told me he's in love with me. 
Then told her. 

Its been one hell of a year so far. "
71,"Once when I was like 9, my grandma sent me a purple sweatshirt from Northern Reflections (an incredibly old lady store) with a very realistic scene of beavers building a dam. I'd love to have it now, but back then, it was awful. I was fat and painfully shy as a kid, had zero friends, and if I had worn that...God help me"
72,"Each guy's testicle was one ""egg"" he implanted on his wife that made her pregnant. So to me, my dad had no testicles, since there was me and my sister. But i saw people with over 2 kids and I was really confused and never gave any thought about that anymore until I found how things *actually* worked haha"
73,I believed social security was insurance to make sure you didn't end up with no friends.
74,"Cons: Having a pants' seam shoved up your vagina all day. Possibilities of discharge wetting through your pants. Denim is not comfortable when it's chafing your bare ass and vagina. If you're wearing a skirt you could accidentally flash your ass or vagina at people. Your vagina could eat your leggings.

Pros: Clearly I don't have any, I love underwear. "
75,My mom told me she always thought I was beautiful but never believed herself attractive until people pointed out that we're pretty much identical in many pictures. It always made me sad and yet I think she's lovely and I'm more average.
76,Whenever she needs it. Birth control pills aren't strictly only for protective sex. It helps with pain and regulation for periods too. 
77,"To make a long story short, when I was nineteen years old, I was drugged and raped by a person I had considered a close, trusted friend. 

He seemed like a genuinely nice guy, and there were not really any major red flags before it happened. He called me one evening saying his long-term, long-distance girlfriend had left him for another guy, and asked me to come over and keep him company. Wanting to be a supportive friend, I dropped what I was doing and rushed over. He kindly made me an iced coffee, and soon I got very sick and blacked out. The next morning, I woke up next to him without my clothes or any memory of the sex I apparently had. Being ignorant, sheltered, and naive, I didn't even realize that what happened qualified as rape. Afterward, I ended up dating him for a year. He lied to our mutual friends to make them drop me, telling them I'd said awful things about them. Once I was thoroughly isolated, he proceeded to abuse me sexually, physically, and psychologically. He would even turn off my alarm clock when I had to wake up early for college exams in the hope that I would miss them and flunk out. He'd try to physically bar me from going to class, and spent most of his time yelling at me, calling me names, and breaking my stuff. I was only nineteen and had come from an abusive family environment, so I had no clue that his behaviour was abusive or abnormal. It was pretty much what I had been used to living with my mom, just with a sexual element added in. I thought he was just constantly displeased with me because I wasn't good enough.

Eventually I went to therapy--to make myself a less shitty girlfriend. My ""boyfriend"" approved, presumably because he couldn't fathom that he was doing anything wrong. He seriously thought that any therapist would see things ""his way."" In the first session, my therapist basically freaked out and gave me a bunch of resources for rape/abuse victims. She opened my eyes to the reality of my situation, and worked with me on a plan to leave. She pretty much taught me from scratch what healthy relationships are supposed to look like. I left him, graduated from college, reconnected with my friends, and eventually married one of them. I've never told anyone about this before except that therapist and my husband."
78,DO NOT DOUCHE. The vagina is self cleaning! Douching fucks up your ph balance and actually makes you *more* vulnerable to infection.
79,"&gt;seriously taking a selfie isn't hard

I beg to differ"
80,Clean your bellybutton. There's a whole microbiome in there. 
81,"Meeting my SO. And, ironically enough, being fired!

I was very unhappy at my job and thinking about quitting. They fired me last wednesday and now they have to pay me a lot of fees that will amount to almost enough for a down payment on an apartment! Plus, I get to spend time with my family. "
82,"Oh man, I thought that I had to sit perfectly still when my parents ran a quick errand and left me in the locked car with the car alarm on.

I thought for YEARS that any movement on my part would trigger the car alarm... "
83,Wash your feet. With soap. Water and soap hitting them on the way to the drain in the shower is not enough. 
84,"One night I decided to go to a bar after work. After a beer a guy I knew from high school showed up with his friends. We chit chatted for a bit before a guy approached me. I was friendly and thought since he wasn't hitting on me he was fine. I didn't recognize him (small town) and soon he went back to his table. After a couple of beers I decided to call it a night and walk home. The guy from high school offered a ride home, but I declined. I got maybe ten feet out of the door before I heard the bar door open. It was the stranger that tried to chat me up. 

I'm prone to panic attacks, but this was nothing like those. Everything in me screamed that I was about to get kidnaped and raped. I didn't have my phone so I couldn't fake a call. I did have my keys though and I stuffed my hand into my pocket and interlaced the keys between my fingers. I was determined not to go down without a fight. 

His steps picked up behind me and I knew it was probably a matter of seconds before he overtook me. Right then high school guy pulled up in his car with the passenger window unrolled. He looked me dead in the eye and said ""You NEED a ride home."" I jumped into the car and looked into the side mirror to see the guy that followed me pantomime checking his pockets and turning around. I asked the high school guy ""Am I crazy..."" He interrupted me and said ""No as soon as you walked to the door that guy was practically running across the bar towards you.""

My gut was right and so was high school guys. If it weren't for his intervention that stranger probably would've kidnaped, raped and possibly murdered me. My boyfriend now husband bought me pepper spray the next day."
85,Eh let the Douche bags weed themselves out.
86,If there's a dog/cat/animal in your photo and dating you does not give me access to that dog/cat/animal then YOU ARE A LIAR. 
87,"I caught my cat sitting on my laptop keyboard once or twice in the past, but apparently today, she managed to navigate to a NSFW subreddit  and opened one of the links while I was out. As if that wasn't bad enough, she'd filled a text box with random characters on the page.  I cannot believe I just had to check my post  history to be sure  she hadn't posted anything. 

 Lulu, I think we need to have a talk about your Internet habits!"
88,"Depends on who is asking and why.

* If it's a casual jab, I brush it off with a joke: ""I don't even know what I'm making for dinner *tonight*""
* If it's out of concern, I say something generic: ""I'm focused on getting everything in order to prepare for the future""
* If they press, I have a few longer term goals that I can direct the conversation to: ""Well my student loans are a big priority right now[...]""
* If they're just being really annoying, or asking about something that's inappropriate (e.g. questions about kids from my co-workers) I just flat out say ""That's not really a priority for right now."""
89,"Our son is only about 3 months old, so I can't tell much yet. But I have been surprised at how many people have told me and my wife that we're unfit to raise a boy, because we're two women. I always make it clear we have plenty of male role models around - just like we have plenty of other female role models around. It takes a village. There's no way in heck we would let our kid grow up with only my wife and I as role models, whether they were a boy or girl. We have plenty of relatives, family friends, teachers, and peers. 

But no, apparently we need ""a man in the house"", AND we need to ""be careful we don't turn him gay"". 

I'm not surprised that people think this way, as much as I'm surprised that they TELL me to my face. Our son is born, there is no man in the house, what do they expect us to do? Give him away? "

Obviously you can't teach a kid every skill at any age, but a lot of dads seem to be more willing to explain and show practical skills to their sons and let them have a go, even if they probably can't do it right yet. And I think it's super important for kids to start thinking about how to fix their own problems as early as possible; both the actual skills and the associated attitude will serve them so well. "

96,"Seconding the Kardashians. As far as I can tell, Kim's never done anything worth loathing her for. 

There's just this rage directed towards them because they're famous for ""doing nothing,"" but I mean -- they are doing something. 

They made themselves an entertainment and consumer brand that people want to buy. Same as any other entertainer, really. 

And I'd wager that Kim actually works harder than an awful lot of people. Between her various business interests and the sheer amount of work it takes to preserve the image her brand depends upon, I mean... it sounds exhausting to me. "

99,"Completely control me. Every part of my life. My interactions with other people: wasn't allowed to talk to men at all, he would veto my friendships with women if he thought they were bad people. He'd have rules about how I had to dress modestly, and do my makeup minimally. **I couldn't even wear pink nailpolish because he didn't like the color.** He had a foot fetish so I had to send him pictures of my feet daily or he'd get upset. He'd twist things and make me feel guilty for saying *well, why can't I sit next to Aaron during my lunch? We're just friends*.

One particular instance I remember I was getting stalked by this guy in the street and the guy was staring at me and making me feel uncomfortable. I texted my boyfriend this and his response was ""what are you wearing?"". As if he's going to decide whether it's warranted for this asshole to harass me. 

We didn't talk for a month because he was on holiday and didn't have internet/cell service. I quite literally felt this weight off my chest and felt this freedom that I can't even begin to explain. It was so surreal, I actually felt euphoric because I didn't have to talk to him. Dumped him as soon as he came back.

I was 17 and I'm actually glad I went through it, because now I'm a lot stronger and would never stand for any of this shit."

Don't get me wrong, it's a great antiseptic cleaner, but it also damages the skin cells, causing the wound to heal slower and produce a much worse scar. I wish I'd known that - and I have all the nasty scars to prove it. I should've used soap and water or a mild saline solution. "

110,"How similar to me she is. She's quiet, introverted, and artistic. She struggles with the same subjects in school as I did and is a 'B' average student just like myself.



I'm also surprised by how her body is turning into mine. She looks nothing like me (I'm white. She has Inuit and Puerto Rican in her with a lot of Inuit showing). So, seeing her sprout up and be a tall, lanky kid with big feet surprised me a little. She was always taller, but since her dad is short, I thought maybe she wouldn't be so tall. Puberty has proven otherwise. "
111,"Around 1998, I walked away from a conversation with my mother under the distinct impression that normal penises point downward, but some men have neat penises that point up.  If you show your interesting penis to a White House intern, you get in trouble because that's inappropriate.

My 17 year old is a competitive cheerleader, in show choir, very aware of her appearance-typical 17 year old. My 10 year old is becoming an athlete, gymnast, soccer, and basketball. I'm noticing the 10 year old starting to care more about her hair being brushed and styled and being more picky about her clothes, like her sister. She is starting to want to listen to the same music her big sis listens to. I guess I'm okay with all of that, just wish it was a few more years before her appearance became important to her. Also I'm noticing my often mouthy 17 year old's words flowing out of the 10 year olds mouth. 😐"

119,"I think she gets a bad rep bc she played an unlikeable character very well. Twilight was awful all around, but she seems to be the one most affected by its legacy. 


Also the whole affair thing. I never heard anyone say anything bad about the married director. It was just about how awful she was for breaking up a marriage. Like...tf?? He was a grown man, who also was in a position of power over her, why is **she** responsible for his actions? And why did she get way worse shit for it?

It didn't take me until I grew up to realize it wasn't true, but it still wasn't until we learned about immigration/naturalization in 3rd of 4th grade that I first started to understand I'd been had. And let me tell you, any number of your formative years sincerely spent believing your mother is a space alien are too many years."
122,"My fiancé didn't kiss me on our first date. I thought the date went well, and was kind of expecting him to, but he didn't. And that was fine...he clearly showed that he was interested in me with or without the kiss, so I actually kind of appreciated that he didn't do it right away. 

It depends on the situation. Most of the time it wasn't an issue if there was no kiss on the first date. If it's the third or fourth and there's still nothing...that might be a different issue. "
123,"When I was 19 I met a guy who told me up front his two deal breakers in a relationship. Smoking &amp; tattoos. I never wanted to smoke but I already had my first tattoo designed in my head.

After we had been married for 20 years he said 'I know you still want that tattoo and it's ok with me if you go get it'.

Currently doing the design work on my third and discussing ideas for his first (although I think he is too chicken to actually get one)

125,"Many years ago my then boyfriend asked our mutual friend what he should get me. The mutual friend said I paint and draw very well (I won several awards back in high school). 

I got a Paint by the Number kit. 

Edit: I should clarify that this was many many years ago, way before ""coloring book for adults"" became popular. There were very few complex patterned ones you could buy back then. "
126,"I used to have a lot of internalized misandry. Most of it stemmed from my upbringing, I had an emotionally and physically abusive father and my mother raised me to hate and fear men. When my brother started outgrowing me physically I was also subjected to abuse by him. When I was in high school I didn't even know men were capable of emotion in any capacity. I had a long-term boyfriend that I loved but I assumed that men ""faked"" love as a means to an end. Any emotion they showed was mimicry to appease women. 

Obviously, this was super fucked up. When I was eighteen I was comforting a school friend because he had broken up with his girlfriend and was torn up about it. I asked him a lot of weird questions like, ""why are you crying?"" ""you chose to do this, why would you be sad?"" ""why are you crying to me, what does this accomplish?"". He was pretty bewildered that I was questioning his ability to feel sad or grieve for the end of a relationship. 

I just hung around men a lot more and went on places like r/askmen a lot. After a while, you realize *everybody* is their own person. People may say things like ""all men watch porn no exceptions"", which seems like a pretty neutral and harmless absolute, but then things happen like when I dated a guy who had absolutely no interest in porn whatsoever. Little things like that just kind of break up your perception of men as some homogenous group. Every person is their own shade of grey. They all have their own opinions and preferences, and moral compasses that all align differently. Each and every single one of them prioritizes a different set of values. Sure, having a dick does mean certain things and it's likely that they've been exposed to different expectations and are shaped by that, but it's the exact same thing for women. Yeah, it's a terrible feeling that we've been raised to watch our backs against men for as long as we can remember, it's hard to not have some issues because of that. We're told about the very awful things that men could potentially do to us and that was something I found very frightening. But even in things like the Brock Turner rape, it was two men who stepped forward and stopped it as soon as they could. We're all just a big jumble of varying degrees of everything."
127,"To be fair, he was the exact same build/height/hair color as my ex and was wearing the same color shirt. The random dude, his wife, my ex all thought it was hilarious. I ran from the store to find the nearest hole in the ground to swallow me up."

134,"Backstory: I live in a city with a 0.6% vacancy rate, basically meaning if you have a cat (which we do) it will be impossible to get a nice, affordable place that ticks off all our boxes. Our house we were living in should have been condemned, we were paying $1000/month for an absolute shit hole, and half the amenities we were promised broke and were never fixed. It was a nightmare, we couldn't stay living there. 

We found a place for $1150/month that included hydro. It had a dishwasher, in suite washer/dryer, 1 bedroom 1 den, free parking and a guest parking spot, shared backyard, big open kitchen, and it was a basement suite. It was pet friendly, no pet deposit necessary if we had a cat, and the landlords were really nice. We did not expect to get that suite. Somehow though, despite everything, we did. We love our house, and our house loves us. "
135,"My mother as well as a few friends implied that I wasn't good enough for my ex.  It was frustrating. 

Which looks wise I could see because he was tall and fit while I'm short and fat (and therefore I don't deserve anybody according to most people). 

But he was super lazy and a total slacker and it seeped into the relationship eventually. Meanwhile I work my ass off and am constantly trying to move my life forward and also tried my best to be a supportive and uplifting girlfriend. 

So I really think it was the opposite and I was too good for him, which is why he's my ex. I STILL have to justify the breakup to people because they can't believe my ugly ass wasn't desperate enough to stick around and be miserable just because I magically snagged a looker. "
136,"Mom of a four year old and three year old here. They surprise me everyday, but some things that really stand out are: 
Their little boy brains are like predestined to gravitate towards ""boy toys"" such as trains and construction vehicles. I mean, sure if I give them a Barbie doll they will play with it, and enjoy movies like frozen and tangled, but if we're at the toy aisle they run to the boy section. It really has nothing to do with what I provide them with. They pick. Also, they discover themselves REALLY early. The other day my four year old says ""mom, my peepee is getting big!"" I say, okay that's fine. He laughs and says ""it's growing big like a bean stalk!"" It was hilarious. And lastly, boys are so sweet. They really do love their moms. I am constantly getting kissed and hugged and it's the best. They love dad too but when they get hurt or are sad it's right to mom no matter what. I love having boys. I think if I had little girls that are just like me I think I'd be miserable haha. "

142,"I leave seconds left on the timer on the microwave. I always grab my food before the buzzer goes off and for some reason it just drives her bonkers when the timer isn't cleared.

144,"Interesting to see that most of what I noticed about women on Tinder  seems to apply to men as well and vice versa. Except for the fish pics and the shirtless pics, haven't seen those with women yet. "
145,"Gaslighting and emotional abuse, mostly around making me feel insecure because I wasn't as outgoing and charismatic as him. He tried to make me feel like my uni studies were worth less to ""our future"" than his essentially full time fast food job. He also tried to convince me that the government support I received to do said study (which I would lose if I ceased studying) was money I didn't do anything to earn.

But the icing on the cake:

We were living in a rented unit together when we broke up. I was talking about what was mine and would therefore stay at the unit and he started talking about how I seemed so sure that I was staying and if he talked to the landlords they'd side with him and let him stay and kick me out.

The landlords were my (very supportive and loving) parents. When I relayed that to them they laughed for a good minute."
146,"My husband once commented that he doesn't like movies that win any awards. Now when we watch anything that has won any award -- acting, directing, writing, people's choice, whatever -- I give a huge disclaimer that it won awards so he will probably hate it. 

He teases me about the *one time* google maps directed me to a TGi Fridays in an airport for dinner. Whenever we are thinking about going out to dinner he suggests we head for the airport. "
147,"I collate these in the form of screenshots. I have so many. I keep thinking if I just censor the eyes and name, I could make a blog of what NOT to do on tinder. 
My pet peeves are; 

* Seriously ripped dudes, in the gym, shirtless, flexing in the mirror. 

* edgelords, one had this pictures set as a fucking CV, one section said 'every woman is a lady (even if they dont know it)' barf. 

* Shirtless selfie just below the shoulders, in a bed, usually by people who dont know how to smile.

* Orange dudes. With added duck face. 

* Guys who take pictures of them with a kid. Seems fair to do so, but I've only actually seen one or two with their OWN kids, they just seem to borrow a kid to take a picture. 

* The amount of skydiving is unbelievable. 

* Ditto with my area having everyone and their mother up the local mountain. 

* group pictures, always of drunken debauchery. If I cant tell who you are in the 2 secs I see your picture, nope. 

* Guys who put their job as 'party animal'

*Dick outlines. One dude would have put an eye out, it cant have been real, he'd pass out if he got an erection I swear. 

* Singular picture, of dude with a drink in hand, in a bar, yelling or pulling a face. Like, that doesnt endear me.

* Pictures of dude with other girls, could be groping them, could be just having ladies draped over them. Like what? 

* 'Dont swipe right if you dont talk' Yeah, no shit. 

* 'I dont use this, add me on [social media app]'


Seriously though, what the fuck is up with it? I open it and I instantly do an eyeroll hard enough to cause a fucking stroke. Girls on tinder seem not weird, and not creepy? 

Someone told me the other day that they wished I was a seed, so they could grow a field of me... "
148,"So my mother in law thought it was appropriate to give me a matching cobalt blue stretchy lace teddy and thong set. Then told me about how it was so lovely and it was French lace, etc. Whatevs!
The following year she gave us a KY yours and mine lube set. So glad I didn't open these 'gifts' in front of anyone but my husband. 
I wonder if she was trying to tell me that she wanted grandkids?"

I also refer to her as big man in front of others. "
153,"My ex was a multi-millionaire heiress, extremely conventionally hot, intelligent and highly educated. And all her friends were celebrities, tycoons, creative prodigies, etc. But weirdly they were all so nice to me. After we broke up, I realised she was a serial dater who had zero standards. One of her new boyfriends was a heroin addict, the other one was a drug dealer who was basically a kid. I guess her friends and family are used to it...

Anyway we remained best friends after breaking up. It was interesting seeing how having all the money you could ever need can negatively affect you. She was really helpless in a lot of ways, bought people's friendship, and had no purpose in life because she didn't need to earn money. She just did a lot of cocaine, went to decadent parties, and dated a new 
person every 3 months and cheated on them.

So while society would say she was far superior to me, I don't think it's that black and white. Surely it's about your character and how you treat people, not what fortunes you happen to have been born with. "
154,"My ex once gifted me something I explicitly told I didn't want (weeks before christmas). And then he was pissed that I didn't like it. 

It was a book I already owned signed by the author but for a different person, e.g. ""For Johnny, from author"". He found it on ebay, told me about it, asked me if I'd like to have it, I said no (with an elaborate explanation), he got it anyway."
155,"Saw a pic of an ex and my (ex? idk) best friend in Chicago going to see Hamilton. I have a huge history with these two fucks basically just not giving a shit about me and ruining my fucking life.

158,"Here's my petty: He said ""ok"" excessively while I was talking.  Harmless quirk the first couple minutes, all-consuming irritation thereafter.

180,"Honestly? How much of his personality gets put down to him being a boy by others. Slow to talk? That's just boys. Climbs everything? Typical boy. Loves his Mummy? Oh, boys do love their mums. When birthdays and Christmas roll around he receives a lot of cars, trucks, trains and so on.

I'd say we've been careful to avoid gender stereotyping but we really haven't. All we've done is provide him with toys, books and activities that align with his interests. This means he has a lot of dinosaurs and sharks, as well as a little kitchen and tea set. He especially loves days out that involve animals (he goes especially nuts for baby animals). He is gentle and polite, and he adores dancing.

Then people turn around and shame them when they get plastic surgery like Meg Ryan and Renee Zellweger."
182,Be sure to take a dump before the date.
183,"Mom of three boys, ages 10, 13, 15, and I think the most surprising thing I've learned so far is that boys are every bit the ""whiny little drama queens"" girls get the bad rap for.

In fact, a house full of my 17yr old daughter's girlfriends for the weekend is *easier* than a handful of my 1pyr old son's friends for one night.

So you know how you hear ""at least it's less drama with boys""? Total bullshit. I've found zero correlation between gender and drama."
184,"Got drunk. Got high. Laid on the floor of the bar bathroom puking for an hour while every single girl in the bar came in and out. Shoutout to all of them though - 2 stayed with me the entire time, 1 got me water and crackers, a bartender brought me a cold rag, and *every* girl asked if I needed anything. Girls are the best.  
  
However, my night wasn't nearly as bad as the girl in the other stall - I got all of my bodily fluids in the toilet, she was not as fortunate."

186,"Casual, passing commentary on women's bodies/looks. I never realized my dad did this until I went to college and came home, and it was like something clicked in my head.  

I've always been very hard on myself on my body/body dysmorphic and I attributed a lot of it to my mother being more outspoken about what my body ""should"" look like, but I'd never realized my dad was doing it, too, just not as explicitly."
187,"With practice. You can literally see yourself when you're taking it so I really don't get what's difficult about moving the phone around to see what works best. 

The guys that take a shot just under their chins, unsmiling, shirtless, one bright light shining directly in front of them, looking like serial killers is what I'm mostly talking about. "
188,"In Brazil it's common to spend the holidays at the beach, and for New Year's Eve you pick your outfit based on what you want for the new year: white for peace, yellow for money, red/pink for love, etc. Most people wear all white, or white mixed with some other color. Wearing black is a big no."

193,"Honestly? All of them. 

I know they ""choose to be in the spotlight"" or whatever, but they're human beings. They have family and friends. I can deal with people thinking things they say are silly or inappropriate if something has happened, but it gets so overboard so quickly.

197,"I HATE ""if you want to know anything just ask."" I ended up rage-Tindering for a bit and sent a message to a guy who had that in his profile. I said: ""You said to ask what I want to know so please answer the following: Are you from the area? If yes, what do you do? If not, what brought you here and how long have you lived in the area? Do you like it?  Do you have any hobbies? If yes, what are they? Do you have pets? Children? What is the most interesting thing about you? What is the least interesting thing about you?""

His response? ""wow lol an interrogation"" "
198,"Alan Rickman, at the beginning of this year (and on my 6 year anniversary with my husband) actually made me feel like I was grieving. I cried in the bathroom at work a few times that week. I adored his acting, I thought he seemed like an honestly good person, it was so unexpected for the public, and Harry Potter was part of my childhood in a big way - and Snape had been my favorite character for so many years. 

Today is hard, too. Carrie Fisher is a hero of mine, and her young life was so hard. I wish she had more years to enjoy being clean and healthier and happier. "
199,"This. So much this. Not just on Tinder, but especially OK Cupid and other dating sites.

You know that infamous OK Cupid study every ""manosphere"" proponent pushes in our faces, where women supposedly found 80% men unattractive? I'd say, it's more like in 80% pictures you can't see what he fucking *looks like*. Judging from what I've seen on both Tinder and OK Cupid, this would hardly be an exaggeration. I've seen all of those you mentioned, plus a few others - a picture of half his face or even just a quarter; a picture where he's making a ""funny"" face which comes out so contorted it's hard to tell what he really looks like; pictures with shitty lightning or extremely unflattering angles. Bonus ones - a picture of his house. A picture of his cactus."
200,"I imagine that short men that are bitter about height are the exact ones who wouldn't be advertising their height in their profile. So most guys who have ""I'm this tall - because apparently it's important"" are posting that not because they are bitter, but because they are tall and don't want to seem cocky, but are well aware that being tall is a bonus point for them.

203,My sister's bestie does this and pokes your armpit when stretching. I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT.
204,I hate when guys hold the camera below them and look down. It is unflattering for everyone. I call that the blowjob angle because I'm assuming that they're trying to show me what it would look like it I was giving them one. Very unappealing.
205,"befriending the weird guy in my class. i thought he was the harmless kind of creepy and just needed a friend. i always had weird ''butterflies'' around him and had never felt like that around anyone before, i thought maybe it meant something special. only nice people study nursing/medicine, right?

206,"My son is only 11 months but I had no idea that little babies got morning wood. His junk usually recedes inside and stays hidden until I push it out to make sure it's clean. If his dick was an integer It would go from like -1 to +15, like HUGE. I know it's natural but it's off putting at first. "
207,"I was planning on going to nursing school. In undergrad, my university didn't offer nursing as a major. After doing some research, I figured no problem, I'll get my bachelors in something else, and go back to school for nursing. That was the plan. 

I had to take some pre-reqs in between degrees. While taking those, two of my sisters were diagnosed with cancer, and my moms arthritis was becoming unmanageable. My dad was working full time. 

I moved home to help them. Someone needed to be there to drive them to their appointments, help with chores, and just be a line of support. That storm has since passed, everyone is doing well. But, I never made it to nursing school. Don't regret it for a second. "

214,"Short answer: I've said it, friends have said it, and it's not a big deal or whatever and I don't find it particularly offensive and have never really taken it seriosly when said by friends and stuff.

Longer answer: On a scholarly feminist sort of note, I do kind of think it does bear thinking about in my opinion. It seems to imply there is something degrading about sucking dick and considering how much of a desired sex act it seems to be, I have to wonder if it doesn't reflect something about how we view the person doing the sucking. Obviously I know that most people don't think too hard when they throw out the phrase (it's super common for me to say it to my SO while we play videos games or just to enemies in the game and I certainly don't harbor any ill thoughts to women who give blow jobs seeing as I am one). But in my opinion, sometimes the things that we use to insult people with (or even just casual phrases we think nothing of) can be at least in some measure a reflection of society."
215,"My son has been getting erections basically from birth...and most likely before, which freaks me out a little. It was weird enough considering I had a tiny penis inside of me (my husband said, ""it's okay. I put it there"") without thinking about fetal boners. 

He's 3 now. I mostly see them when I'm wiping poop off of his penis, because that causes it. He giggles and says it tickles.

I think I do a good job pretending it doesn't make me feel weird -- I don't want him to feel like any part of his body is bad -- but I do have to admit, it's a lot easier to clean poop off a tiny erect penis than a tiny floppy one."

217,"Mine is from my ex, who was notoriously terrible in the romance department. So its extra special. I had been telling him the story about when my mom took me to my very first concert when I was 11 and bought me a way cool band T-shirt with KIZZ written in rhinestones. I went straight to my dad's house after and just couldn't stop talking about the concert. The next day my step mom did laundry and the dumb ass threw my brand new shirt in the dryer and every last rhinestone fell off. I was beyond livid. It was one of the few times I actually cried. I kept it for 12 years anyways with just the glue marks on it. While I was gone at work he went to Michaels and bought rhinestones and krazy glue and fixed my shirt. It was the sweetest thing I had ever had done for me. I still have it now another 7 years later. It's one of my fondest memories of him. "

220,"Surprisingly for me it was Bojack in Bojack Horseman (animated Netflix feature). 
Kind of a weird show, but just the way that Bojack's spiral into deeper and deeper depression and the self sabotage that goes with it was shown, made it very easy to recongnize and relate.
They definitely portrayed his tendencies to turn to substance abuse instead of coping VERY well, which is something I found easy to relate to.
Might not be the most relateable unless you have a very destructive, self sabotaging type of depression, but for those of us who do, I thought that it was written very well."

Threw my cel phone into traffic so I couldn't call the police after he tried to strangle me outside a nightclub. While I was running to a gas station for help he chased after me screaming that he'd beat me home and kill my dog.

232,"Yeah man, they sit in their poop and it just mushes up in there. Shit happens ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ "
233,"Lol I have a similar story.

My aunt works for a business personalization company for products for literally everything. So she had expired products up the wazoo as samples for companies - water bottles, too many pens, lotions, lip glosses, keychains, perfumes, expired chocolate, nail files,  - all with a random example company logo on them. So when I was a kid, she basically FILLED my stocking with this shit. To the extent that everyone else would be like, ""oh billie_holiday, looks like we don't need to add anything else to YOUR stocking, it's filled to the brim!""

When I got older and far after I realized what she had been doing all these years, I started collecting the left over stuff she'd put in there and the next year putting it all in her stocking. I must have been 12-13 but I was passive aggressive as fuck. She stopped putting as much crap in my stocking after that."

240,"It always seems like Kim gets a ridiculous amount of hate no matter what she does:

Lives her life on camera? Desperately needs attention.

Waited a while to share photos of her kids when they were born? Why isn't she showing people what they want to see?!

Bought herself something nice she can clearly afford? How selfish!

Donated to charity? She's just doing it for publicity! Why didn't she donate more!?  "
241,"My daughter does too. Me and my daughter say we're BFFs (she's almost 6). She just made me a best friend bracelet that says mommy and has a bunch of hearts. She always says I'm the best mommy and most beautiful and can do anything (shes great for the ego!). But with my son it's just *different*. I have no favorites, my kids are both my babies. But it really is a different bond between mom and son.

Edit: Since this comment has gotten me a few replies and PMs, I figured I'd show off my BFF bracelet that I wear every day:

242,"Ha!

My husband was married when he and I started dating.  I didn't know, at first, that he was married until another friend of ours told me.  I asked him, ""are you married?"" and he said he was, but ""things weren't good"" and he was unhappy and it was all but over.  

I said, ""Great.  When it's over, call me."" and walked away.

Three days later and he's moving out of his house and into an apartment and filing for divorce.  Once his divorce was final, we got married.  

That was 27 years ago.  We are happily married still and get along swimmingly with his ex, her husband and all our kids.  "

250,"I agree, it's all about phrasing.  Your first example is harsh and negative, while the second version still communicates your preferences but in a way that isn't rude/mean.  I'm slim, but if a guy wrote  ""don't contact me if you're fat"" I wouldn't contact him either because he doesn't sound like a nice guy."

252,"I recently read the book Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers, as recommended by my EMT instructor. It's a non-fiction book in which a journalist goes around learning about the use of human cadavers in medical research. It's a good read for anyone who would be comfortable with that kind of thing. 

Currently, I'm reading A Dog's Purpose, a novel about the many lives of a dog as it lives, dies and is reincarnated with full memories of all previous lives, fulfilling different roles and learning important lessons in each life. He's a stray, then he's a family pet, the *she* is a police dog, and so on. It's really interesting as it's told entirely from the point of view of a dog, who can not understand human speech. No talking animals here, and the dog can't talk to other animals, even dogs, either. The story is really creative in that it has to convey information from the dog to the reader in a way that you, as a human reader, can understand, even when the dog does not. I believe a movie is coming out next month based on it. I'm only about half-way through, but so far I love it. "

259,"Not a momma, but as a nanny I have seen some trends:

French mothers have it entirely figured out. I don't know how, but they do.

American mothers (I am American) who accept childcare assistance without internal shame over it seem to be better at maintaining a separate sense of self. The big secret no one admits to is that *every mother* has help raising her child. Every single one. So you might as well embrace that reality and take the naps you need and go to the girls nights you crave and keep up the Yoga that kept you grounded or whatever it is that keeps you as yourself. Your chemicals and years of evolution are telling you that your baby is breakable...but they are surprisingly not. Other adults, including Daddy, can provide adequate care.

And for the first six months, so long as baby is fed, clean, warm, dry, and well slept, baby is happy no matter whose arms baby is in. Stranger Danger comes muuuuch later.

The flip side of this is that the Moms I have seen, even as nanny to those very moms and hired by those very moms, who won't give themselves physical distance from their child, much less mental distance, are the ones who lose their identity the most predictably."

267,"I think Crazy Ex-Girlfriend does a pretty good job of not only portraying depression and anxiety, but also how those illnesses can drive certain actions. I feel like depression and anxiety are often portrayed as immobilizers, moodiness, or random personality traits in the media. CEG shows how Rebecca's can cause her to make irrational decision, self-sabotage, or even have a nervous breakdown, which is sometimes reality for people struggling with those diseases."
268,"I fought my way into nursing school but had to withdraw in my second (of four) semesters because I could not adjust my studying style fast enough to get  a C or better that I needed to stay in.  It was a strategic withdrawal so that I could reapply and get back in.  If I had failed the semester I would have tanked my GPA and never would have made it back in.

So when people ask me how much school I have left I tell them a year and a half.  Which is true once I get back in.  But I've been telling them a year and a half for over a year now...

Eventually I just fessed up about my ""unfortunate hiatus"" from the nursing program.  Everyone has been supportive.  It's part of my story and my story isn't done yet.  I just have to remind myself that I'm human and it's ok to be unsure or to have set backs, as long as you keep moving forward by learning and growing.

Btw, I just got reinstated to the nursing program! How long until I'm finished?  A year and a half. :D"
269,"Boyfriend has a son, I have a daughter. When we both have our kids, we don't see each other. We were both supposed to have our kids last night but then he realized he wouldn't have his son so the option to hang out with me and my daughter was available.

I'd previously stated I put a lot of value on NYE and find it symbolic. Like I want to be with who I love and wake up and do something to set the tone for the year. 

""It's never been a big deal to me,"" he said. So I guess it shouldn't be for me either?

He offhandedly said he was going out to dinner with his friends. Then it was he was going out with them after. Then it was he'd be the DD and be out all night. 

Didn't even give it a thought to ask me what *we* should do. That maybe we could have dinner together, put my girl to bed, and ring in the new year together.  It would have been our first one. 

""Oh I didn't consider that an option,"" he said when I told him it hurt my feelings that he didn't even consider it. Then he went out anyway. Seemed pissed about my reaction. 

It was just the last straw to really show me that he's not committed to me or having a future in which we are a we. It was rather embarrassing to see his pictures out on the town with friends while I put my kid to bed and fucked around alone until I feel asleep too. I wonder if any of his friends were like ""What's up with that?"" 

He's a party animal. I am not. Also we are middle aged so it's not like I'm dealing with an actual frat boy here. Well he was one, that should been the first red flag. ⛳️ 

I went with some girlfriends and my daughter to see the city fireworks show, and I broke up with him this morning. New year, new start. I want a family, and I want someone who wants to be with me on NYE.

277,"How fearless and dare-devilly she is! It's funny because my nephew is into ""girly"" things (mainly tea parties with animals, and baking - perhaps he has a future as a restaurant owner?), so when my daughter was born, we just assumed they could play together. Nope, she needs to be moving constantly, preferably on a high-speed vehicle!

She tries all kinds of stunts with her trike and mini car, ramming them into stuff and trying to spin them around. She's gotten a few little figures for Christmas, but the only thing I've seen her do with them is put them all in a car and push them off a ""cliff"" (the table).

She has a huge Scalectrix racing set which she beats my brother at. A push truck you can sit on, an electric mermaid car, a skateboard (although I don't let her ride that without a shit ton of protection), a pink BMX. 

She doesn't give a crap whether the toy looks like it's for boys or girls, she just wants wheels wheels and more wheels. 

And I remember, I was the same! But my dad practically beat it out of me. (He only hit me a few times, but it really affected me.) I wasn't allowed to do anything that wasn't girly.

Now I'm remembering how much I love it too. I'm seriously considering taking up skateboarding so I can ride with her. 

I'm just trying to find the right balance between encouraging her love of extreme sports, and making sure she doesn't get hurt. I got her so much fun protective gear for Christmas, lol. "

281,"Sadly, you've also described the majority of women's profiles, too. I keep saying, ""Just once, I'd like to see someone who says they hate having a good time"" - but then I worry that they'd be serious."
282,Also shots of them holding the deer they just killed or the fish the just caught.
283,How funny that some issues are international (like not showing their face) and some are very much not (mother in laws dream).

285,"Not everything has to be a life lesson. I literally got a lecture this weekend about keeping your head cool in a crisis because I had to borrow a torque screwdriver to repair my oven after it caught a greasefire from a leaky springform pan. Mind you, I dumped a bag of flour on it, put it out, and then set out to disassembling and cleaning once it cooled, but I still got a ""It's important to remember where your head is at"" for about two hours. 

I just wanted a screwdriver head that I didn't own. "
286,Thank you. I was definitely imagining some kind of beautiful ice cream concoction in an actual blender.  
287,"When they write ""if you want to know just ask."" Like no. Sorry, I don't want to know that badly. If I can't tell that we might have at least one thing in common to talk about, I'm not wasting my time. How hard it is it to put 3 things you like to do in your profile? It just makes you look lazy, and I move on."
288,"A guy threw his drink at me after asking him to leave me alone when he wouldn't stop coming onto me... Just persistent guys at the club I guess, it got somewhat annoying. :/"
289,"IIRC that study also made it so that if you rated someone above four stars, it sent them a message. Meaning men would be much more likely to rank more women highly in hopes of generating a response, and women would be much more selective and cautious about how they rated people because they don't want to expose themselves to a massive response. It's been a while since I actually read the whole thing but I recall there being a lot of issues with the ""standard"" interpretation because it was never meant to be generalized to a larger population or to a broader application. 

Methodology and statistics: things I have strong opinions about."
290,"My mum always told me that avocado tastes like soap so I missed out on years of eating it, gutted. Double irony is that mum believed that because my nan told her, so I made her eat some and she bloody loves it. Moral of the story, try things out for yourself, if any of you are as naive as I was."

294,"I got married, AND I got the incredibly small wedding that I had wanted."
295,"I make coffee every morning and serve it to my wife in bed.  In the Starbucks coffee mug that is her favorite.  If we grill steaks I give her the biggest or best cut.  If she cooks I do all the cleanup afterwards.

It's the little things that matter."
296,"Text back - ""which one is your son?"""
297,"Honestly, and this sounds awful, that men have feelings. I was brought up in an unhealthy environment and when I had my son at 19 I was blown away throughout the years at how deeply he feels emotions. It wasn't that I hated men or looked down on them, I just thought that's how they were. In the process I have become more comfortable showing my own emotions with people. My son made my life so much better than I could have imagined."
298,"It's weird to me that they get so much hate from liberals considering they are a very modern (blended/interracial/LGBT friendly) family, and the fact that Kim is the biggest sex symbol of our time as a mother in her late thirties who is very middle eastern looking and does not have the conventionally attractive skinny white girl body is a REALLY big deal."
299,I would have shined the flashlight in his ear and said I was looking for a brain.

302,"Treating men, in particular boys/young men, as creatures without control and at the will of biological urges. It's harmful not just to their daughters but to the young men in their daughter's lives. Don't teach your daughter to treat all males as uncontrolled animals - teach her to expect and demand thought and respect from all people, including herself. It'll protect her from a hell of a lot more than just bad sexual decisions."
303,This thread is making me feel so much better. I just moved across the country and my mom has been guilt tripping me for not having new friends in my new town. Spending NYE alone has been feeling really lonely and embarrassing.

308,"I was an only child raised by a single mom, very little experience with boys, so everything! My first kids were twin boys. I think I was mostly surprised when they were little how *everything* they played with became a truck/race car. One of them did pee on me once when I was changing his diaper. As they got older, everything was Lego and nerf guns. For years! My teenagers now do not care a bit about hygiene and I have to remind them to shower, use soap, brush their teeth. They got very smelly when puberty first started. They have a lot of energy and are fearless compared to my girls. One of them loves reading fantasy/sci-fi books. The other is more into gaming and sports. Good luck! Just remember, all kids are different and YMMV. "
309,"1. No clear photos of their face, every pic they have sunglasses on, or are turned away from the camera, or it's super blurry/grainy.

2. Their bio is trying way too hard to sound deep or intellectual, or tries to be funny and fails.

3. Please no more pics of guys holding fish. Seriously."
310,"I walked away from a similar conversation believing all penises stick straight up, which, I figured, was why men had to use their hands to pee. They had to force it down to face the toilet. 

But I absolutely adore that you learned that it's inappropriate to flash a White House intern, but only if your penis is interesting. "
311,"They were married 7 years and had a 6 year old son.  She had children from a first marriage, so they were very close to their step-dad/my husband.  

I was very nervous to meet them.  I remember walking into her house to pick up our son for a weekend visit and all four of the kids just stared at me like I had a giant ""A"" on my chest.  She, their mother, was very gracious and polite.  We didn't really communicate, I left that to my husband for the first few years of our marriage.  ""Jake"" is their son, after all.  They never argued about child-raising, custody or support.  Since I now work for a divorce attorney I know how rare that is.  If she had any bitterness toward me, I never knew it and I never had any toward her.

I never made waves between my husband and his ex, or between him and his son.  When Jake was with us, I made sure his mother got pictures, cards and letters and copies of his grade cards.  We became friends after a while, especially when Jake became a teenager.  His dad was in the Navy and often deployed, so it was just her and I for 6 months at a time keeping each other up to date on the boy and making plans for visits and parenting time.  

When the boy was 17, he and his girlfriend got pregnant.  Naturally, his mother came to visit to see her new grand-baby and we spent a lot of quality time together.  

She told me how much she appreciated me taking care of her son.  She said she knew I loved him so she never worried when he was with me.  She could tell he loved me too and it made her happy to know he was loved so much.

I was completely floored.  No one has ever said anything so kind to me.  I told her how much I appreciated her kindness and respected her.  She was kind to me when she had no right to be.  Her openness and loving heart made it possible for ALL of us to be a family - her children, their children, me and my husband.  We've created this huge, happy family out of broken relationships and heart ache.  I could not be more blessed.  She's one of my best friends and I've turned to her for advice and support many times over the years.  We talk online or on the phone a few times a month and even vacationed together.  She's the best person I've ever known - maybe ever will know.  You just don't find that kind of love every day and I cherish it.  "
312,I put my hand wherever he is about to sit down and grab his ass. It freaks him out and he jumps back up. 
313,I had a female cockatiel who used to masturbate. Apparently it's pretty common for them but I was a teenager and remember tossing the remote at her cage because I was trying to watch tv in peace. 
314,"Saying stuff like, ""I'm such a girl, I hate/love whatever thing women stereotypically love,"" and assume whatever they feel is universal for all women.  Or if I'm talking about my boyfriend, they'll ask how I got him to do something (like, go into LUSH with me) or mention a guy stereotype. 

I just feel like we won't click because I've never really felt like women are different from men. "

321,"&gt;Guys who take pictures of them with a kid. Seems fair to do so, but I've only actually seen one or two with their OWN kids, they just seem to borrow a kid to take a picture.

This always makes me laugh because I hate children. Your ""Cute"" tactics have no power here!

"
322,"You know what really annoys me about the hate for Kristen Stewart? The hypocrisy. People seemed to praise Jennifer Lawrence because she was 'awkward' and 'clumsy' which apparently made her 'real' and 'down to earth'. It didn't matter what that woman did, she was seen as real because of her awkwardness (even if she was being down right rude or stupid.) But when these people are presented with someone like Stewart who seems to be genuinely awkward in social situations and actually clumsy they don't like it. She seems nice, doesn't say mean things about others so I don't get the hate. So much for wanting a celebrity who is 'real' and 'down to earth' lol. Those two adjectives have lost all meaning to me now. 

Criticising her acting is fair game though of course. "
323,"1. Group pictures. Which one is the profiles owner? Never the hot one.


2. Profile picture is just a picture of a stomach.

327,"November 28 and the days that followed, as that was the day that my father unexpectedly passed away. 

He had sent me a huge care package back in May with
 almost all mementos and little things from when I was a child (there was quite a lot, I've always been a complete daddy's girl) - two weeks later our house burned down. 

Today would have been his 63rd birthday. I guess I'm not doing too hot today either, honestly. 

I hope all of you have a warm holiday with the people you care about.

Edit: my period just started. The best part of Christmas is that it's never too early to break out the 'nog, right?

Edit II: Surprise happy update: a few weeks before he passed away, my father had sent me a Christmas present. I'd stashed it away and subsequently forgotten all about it, as I've been dealing with the aftermath of death; paperwork, wills, bills etc. Celebrating Christmas with my husband tonight, he had brought the present and we opened it together. It contained a handwritten card from my father, and handmade viking glasses just like the ones he had given us for our wedding, but that we had lost in the fire. I've been crying and laughing and toasting him for hours now. "
328,"Probably the ""smile!"" thing. And no, of course all men / the majority of men don't do it (disclaimer!). But I've gotten it so many times in my life and only from men that it is inextricably gender-linked in my mind. Whenever it happens I am a fountain of annoyance."
329,I'm sure they were glad you thought that.

331,"That's when I started BC pills. I had massive, horrific, periods and cramping. I was also a competitive ice skater. I couldn't deal, I literally couldn't straighten my body upright enough to get out onto the ice. So I asked my parents about birth control.  Thankfully at the time my dad was running a Women's hospital so he was all for it. My mom had cramps like me, so she was ok with it. I did have a stigma with some girls at school after a sleepover, and them finding out about it. But I said fuck them. I wanted to be able to skate, and not die.

332,"I thought that colour was ""invented"", and the world was literally in black and white until colour tv came around. "
333,"I don't care, I can wait. If I really want a kiss, I will go for it by myself."
334,"Well, since I mostly date men it's been mostly men who've made me say ""UGH MEN"" and it's usually due to a dating behavior.

335,"On the second date with my current girlfriend, she took me to a secluded beach after dark and brought blankets and sweatpants and hoodies (the latter being because she remembered I said I get cold easy) and we talked and kissed and cuddled on the beach for hours. There was very little light pollution and I could see the Milky Way for the first time in my life. The universe decided to wingman and throw in some shooting stars, which made me feel like I might have been in a coma and was going to wake up in a hospital, because it was so surreal. We were trying not to have sex because it was only our second date but that only lasted a few hours. So we had wonderful sex on the beach under the milky way and shooting stars. It couldn't have been more magical. Then we went back to talking and cuddling. The entire night lasted maybe 8 hours and it's something I'll never forget. "
336,My wife did this for a while until I started doing it back. Then suddenly it wasn't fun anymore haha. 
337,"I thought that all TV and movies were the product of someone literally filming someone's life. I only recently saw the film ""The Truman Show"" (amazing movie) and basically I thought that *all* tv and movies were like that. And I'm 27 so this was way before reality TV. "
338,"While agree with the sentiment, Steve Buscemi definitely gets shit for it."
339,this is definitely one of the funniest omg
340,"This might be weird, but the way he is with my (our) cat. He loves her so much. She sleeps on my side of the bed, and almost every night he'll ask if he can hold her, so I have to pick her up and give her to him.  He spoils her to no end..buys her toys, gives her treats, cuddles with her. When I first moved in, I was kinda concerned that it wasn't going to work because he's not a""cat person"" (I didn't care-she is a non-negotiable). That changed pretty quickly...a few months and he was just in love with her.  

I guess it makes me see him as a good future dad. He comes off as a strong manly dude, but he's all fluff inside. I love him so damn much. "
341,"My cat does the same thing! He only plays with one toy of his in particular when I'm either gone or he thinks I'm asleep. It's adorable. His reaction to getting caught is the best. He will either freeze with it in his mouth, and not move (as if I can't see him if he's still), or he'll put it down slowly and pretend it never happened.  "
342,"I had been texting someone for 2 months and when I finally agreed to meet him he gave me the best date of my life. Took me to a private park, took me on a tour of the entire place telling me all the local legends and his history there as well, then we went to a pond where he took me out on a rowboat with donuts and beer. We just drifted around talking for hours, then when it got dark out he pulled out a blanket he'd brought for me and a laptop to watch movies on. But honestly we didnt bother with the movies, just ended up just laying there the entire night under the stars, cuddling under the blanket and stuff. "
343,She had a really huge mole on her neck. Couldn't stop being distracted by it to the point of feeling an extremely strong urge to pull it out. I was too obsessed and unnerved by it.

345,"Mine is going to be suuuuuuper mild because I can count the amount of first dates I have had on a few fingers.  But maybe it will get some giggles?

This was actually my first first date ever.  I was in high school, awkward, and excited that someone asked me out.  Except he was raised super super super super religious and I was raised agnostic.

We went to go see Napoleon Dynamite and he moved over a seat when I sat down next to him in the movie theater.  ""*I need to save a seat for Jesus*"".  :l"

348,She's lucky to have you. I'm sure she feels that everyday. 
349,That is hilariously adorable.
350,"My stepmom used to do shit like this. She made more money than my dad and made sure to flaunt how much more her kids were ""loved"" on Xmas morning than my sister and I. One Xmas my stepsister got diamond earrings and my other stepsister got a kitten. My sister and I got these plastic storage bins that looked like [this](https://www.walmart.com/ip/IRIS-3-Drawer-Rolling-Storage-Cart/40685376).

Like I get it -- they're your kids and you shouldn't have to spend as much on your stepchildren --  but Jesus Christ at least *pretend* to make an effort."
351,"&gt; they're very different people but they find a way to play and enjoy each other's company. Who knows how long that will actually last, but for now it's very sweet. 

My brother is 18 months younger than me and we played well together up through being teenagers (we just switched from toys to video games basically). We're still close (I'm 25 and he's turning 24 soon). YMMV, but it's possible that they could stay close for a long time."

He didn't tell her he was infected until she had symptoms and confronted him.  His attitude was ""Now you're stuck with me.""

I was completely horrified for so many reasons and to this day cannot eat eggs Benedict.  "
357,"Same. When I read the question I was wondering if I was the weird one for not wanting to kiss on a first date. *Maybe* we kiss on the first date if they were someone I was friends with for awhile first, but if it's someone I met online or a blind date then no, I don't want to kiss you after having only known you in person for a few hours."

360,"In a similar vein, someone I went to school with thought that a man only ever fired off a singular sperm and it's purpose was to break apart the egg like an actual eggshell so that the pre-formed baby inside could break out.

She also thought spooning involved actual spoons. "

362,"Very well, thank you! It's been over five years since I last saw him, he lives thousands of kilometres away, the divorce was easy, we're civil and he has since given me a genuine apology. He recognizes now what he did. 

I'm in a great and healthy relationship with the love of my life, and honestly, while I regret the trauma I took out of my last relationship, I learned a lot too. Hard and painful lessons, but still."
363,"I have two cats.  When they were kittens they used to snuggle each other a lot. 

Once they were just laying next to each other, spooning kinda, with one grooming the back of the other's head.

364,"On a similar note, in middle school my dad convinced me I was both:

1) adopted 

2) an actual alien from outer space they found in a field. I changed into a human baby when he picked me up and that's why I didn't look strange. 


Telling a kid who has memory problems, concentration problems, emotional regulation problems, and a massively distorted perception of human time that they're an alien..... well, to that kid it makes a whole awful amount of sense. 

He thought it was a one-time joke that lasted a few minutes before he said ""aha just kidding""

I quietly believed it for several years. 

When I had a hard time making friends I accepted that it was because I was an alien and had to try harder to learn their customs, to ""pass"" better. 

Yeah.... 

Turns out I have ADHD. 

Any Formative years believing you are an alien is Too Many Years. 

Remind your children they are human, and yours. 

Fuck that explains so many of my terrible social habits though "
