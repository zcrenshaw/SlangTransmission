0,"Anger is an emotion, bro. Don't call me emotional and yourself logical and rational when so many of your opinions are based in anger and frustration. "
1,"Not exactly during the first date, but before, during and after it.

He was extremely hyped for the date. He couldn't stop telling me how he'd never had that connection to someone after talking so little etc etc

When we had our date, he kept telling me about his dad's suicide attempt. I've attempted suicide too, so I felt very bad and tried to console him. It worked, we got along well anyway even though I was getting weird vibes.

The next day I receive a message that said ""sorry (my name), you're the perfect woman for me but I can't get past this. Your pictures were incredibly misleading. You're so beautiful, your face, your hair, your body. But I never date someone with darker skin than me. I'm sorry"". He was pasty white and I'm tan. Fuuuuck youuuuu"
2,"Any time someone says that looks don't matter, I roll my eyes. While I don't think they should be the *only* thing that matters, physical attraction is pretty important. "
3,"I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all answer for this one. It depends on the woman. 

Some women have more hobbies and interests in common with men, so they get along easier. 

Some women get burned by toxic friendships with other women or feel excluded by them, so they think all women must be like that and turn to men for friendship. While obviously not all women are like that, I can sympathize with this group because I've been bullied and backstabbed by girls plenty of times, and it can affect how much you trust them.

Some women just really don't like other women, and there isn't always a good reason. In my personal experience, women who fall into this category are usually insecure and don't like to be part of a circle that includes other women because they like being special or the ""token girl"" of the group. I try to avoid women like this because they often tend to be nasty to other women."
4,Stop comparing me to other women when complimenting me. You might think it validates what you're saying but in reality its doing the opposite. Don't put other women down to justify why you think I'm great. Just tell me 
5,"We were making out in my car, and he stuck his hand down my pants, then froze, pulled away, and asked if I was willing to consider shaving more thoroughly if we got serious.

The thing that kills me about this one is that is definitely the sort of thing I'd compromise on - if we're dating and my SO expresses a grooming preference, I'm fine with making some changes. But bringing it up right away as a condition of continuing to date? Nope."
6,"Reddit suggests breaking up/breaking all contact/divorce for *every* relationship complaint. While there are instances where going separate ways is the best thing to do, it isn't the answer for every case. Reddit could probably stand to calm down. "
7,"We can like something and be a fan of something without knowing every fucking minute detail about it. I love comics; no I do not know who douche man from issue 32 of the limited run douche man series is. No, that does not make me a ""fake"" comic book fan. I am not reading A Song of Ice and Fire to get a boyfriend. I don't need to name every Beatles song I've ever heard of just because I have a graphic tee of their logo on. I'm not rattling off college football stats to prove myself to you. "
8,"We bought ice cream cones and were walking through a park. Things were going okay, we chatted about the usual stuff. There were no red flags yet but no connection, either. Out of nowhere he turns to me and in the most nonchalant way asks ""Do you wanna go fuck in the park bathrooms?""

So I went home."
9,"i got not-good-enough-to-be-a-girlfriend-but-good-enough-to-pass-time-with-and-fuck-zone'd a whole lot, if that counts"
10,Don't come in here asking a question and then argue with every woman answering. It makes you look like a child. 
11,"I don't owe you my attention because you complimented me.

I'm being polite to you because I'm a polite person not because I want to suck your cock. 

I don't care if you find me attractive or not. My life's worth is not measured by how hard I can make your dick."
12,"Had an amazing date with a guy, felt the strongest connection with him that I've ever really felt. We joked and laughed a lot, had an amazing meal and talked for hours, never a lul in the conversation at all. Just perfect. I asked him out so I paid for the meal.


Went out on a second date, again amazing. Even better then the first, it was like we had known each other for years. Did i mention he was totally gorgeous?

The date ended and he paid. I was seriously into this guy. 

Turns out he wasn't into me. Told me he just wasn't feeling it or any connection or spark. :/ i asked why he bothered with the second date and he said he wanted to pay me back since I paid for the 1st date :/


I just never realised two people could experience the same thing and have such different viewpoints on connections and chemistry"
13,Food trucks. Apparently everyone sold their boutique cupcake shops and bought trucks.
14,"Emotional labor is a very real thing. Personally, I don't mind doing it, BUT! only because my husband appreciates it. Social calendars, birthdays, asking people how they're feeling, baking cookies for the new neighbors, returning borrowed items from the other neighbors... those things, IME, almost always fall on women (and certainly do in my household of 5 people, 3 animals). And they're not as ""visible"" as things like fixing the light, picking up beer, etc. but they do take a toll.

Example: I have between 5-10 guests in and out this month and next at my house. I cleaned, I washed the sheets, I picked up extra beer, put a little gift bag together for the kid/s, I hid the weed from said kids' view. My (male) roommates seem to think that just... happened. No, it took deliberation and a full Saturday, so that we can relax and hang out while the guests come and go). Again, I'm happy to do it, but running a household takes effort and energy and emotion. Even things like emotional support, asking people if they need anything/ listening to people... all those things take away from my self-care - recognize it!"
15,Way to catfish him! How was he supposed to know you're a mammal?! 
16,"""Love happens when you're not looking for it."" Sure, it's possible to meet someone when you're at the grocery store, or the library, but the odds of you finding love randomly are pretty slim. Ask your friends if they know anyone they can set you up with, join social groups, try online dating, etc. Putting yourself out there is much more effective than just hoping someone will fall onto your lap"
17,"So many men don't know how to take the word ""no"" for an answer. If I don't wanna send you nudes, if I don't wanna date you, if I don't wanna have sex with you, don't get all fucking pissy, don't try to convince me to do any of those things. No means no. I don't owe you fuck all."
18,"I was a flower girl at my cousin's wedding. The ring bear was about my age and a distant cousin. We all went to my uncle's lake house the day before the wedding and I found a bunch of cool shells. He asked to see them and I said no because he could break them. He promised not to break them so I handed them over. The jerk promptly closed his fist, crushing all of them. I was around 10 at the time. I will never forget"
19,"Not me but my parents.  They met on a blind date, got engaged that night and were married a month later.  My dad passed away last year four months before their 45th wedding anniversary.  I would say their marriage turned out pretty great."
20,He talked about his dead dog -- which passed away when he was twelve -- *the entire time.* Whenever I'd try to change the subject he'd find a way to bring the conversation back to that dead dog. 
21,"Most advice involving sex seems to boil down to: ""Your preferences are sacred, any partner who doesn't fulfill them 100% or, god forbid, changes over time is incompatible.  It is your right and duty to yourself to end the relationship over this triviality.""

Is it possible to have fundamental sexual incompatibilities?  Of course.

Is ""my girlfriend cut her hair and I've lost attraction"" anywhere remotely in the realm of what is reasonable here?  Hell fucking no."
22,"Apples. It's a crazy good apple year in Finland and everybody's going nuts about what to do with all those apples! Local media is filled with news about people rushing to juicing stations, magazines are full of apple recepies. I saw a news article warning not to dump your extra apples on higway banks (apparently this is a thing) because they might attract moose and increase risks of accidents."
23,Meals served on wooden boards. Every time I cut something it skips across the board. And they take up too much space on the table and I worry they aren't as clean as plates.
24,"When I was in college, I went on a date with someone who was reallllly racist, specifically against people of Mexican descent. Since I'm light-skinned, he apparently missed the part on my bio about me being Latina, and when I let him know, he said I ""didn't count because [I was] practically white."" He also let me know that he'd date me, because I was ""pretty for a Mexican."" "
25,"lmao WHAT, you're absolutely perfect and it's meant to be but your skin is too dark? i bet he tried to make it out like he was so ~tortured over his terrible dilemma

what a weirdo"
26,The first night I met/spent with the guy I'm currently dating we got shit faced and he wet the bed.
27,"Grow thicker skin.  

I think that it would be tragic if humanity stopped trying to work towards being decent to each other, and instead opted to just not take anything to heart.  

Maybe I'm idealistic and na√Øve, but I'd much rather people told mean people to be nicer over telling hurt people to get over it.  

I just think words are powerful and they can hurt, so why not just teach people to be more careful and good with them? Life doesn't have to be so miserable for everyone."
28,"At church we had a ""Candy Lady"", a little old woman who gave candy to the children. We would all wait in line after church, eager for some sweets. I specifically remember a little boy in front of me getting 2 pieces of candy. When it was my turn, I took a second piece. ""Tsk tsk"", she said, ""Only the boys get two pieces of candy."". From that day on, the Candy Lady was never the same, and I've held a grudge to this day. "
29,"All of it. It just feels good. And it's not just about the orgasm, but about the closeness and intimacy with my partner. I *have* orgasmed during sex, once, but it wasn't even the session I enjoyed the most.

Eating chocolate doesn't give me an orgasm but I still want to do it. Kissing my partner doesn't give me an orgasm but I still love doing it. "
30,I see you *staring* and I think less of you because of it. 
31,"""Opposites attract."" People forget the other half of that saying ""... but they don't stick together."" 

In the happy marriages I can think of, the couples are pretty darn similar - in preferences/ energy level/ money habits/ interests. If not similar, then complementary. Over time, a lack of commonalities is a hindrance, IME. "
32,"If you think a woman is unattractive, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.  You don't need to give your opinion.  She probably already has rock bottom self-esteem."
33,"I was reading a highbrow but boring book recently, and complained to my dad about how long it would take to finish. He said, 'Just ditch it. There are so many books and not enough time to read them all.'

It was the first time I really felt like if something (usually a book!) isn't working for you, it's OK to just stop. "
34,"He acted like it was the worst thing ever that we weren't compatible and I couldn't be his girlfriend, but also that it was my fault for basically catfishing him (?). Then kept booty calling me for months because apparently a dark-skinned girl can't be his girlfriend but he can fuck her just fine right?"
35,"A kindle. I always read a lot and was super anti-kindle because I loved books. My mom bought me a Kindle for Christmas a few years ago and I absolutely love it. I can get any book I want within minutes, and most books for free from the library while I'm just sitting at home. Also, I can bring a billion books with me wherever I go and it takes up almost no space. I also have arthritis in my hands so holding a book open gets painful for me after a few minutes but the kindle is really easy to hold!"
36,"SHUT UP! We don't need your opinion on make-up, what we eat, our clothes, what we choose to spend time on, or anything really. (Unless we ask.)

And when women express what living as a woman is, SHUT UP! You don't know better.

Also, believe us! Yes it happened, yes it happened the way I said it happened, and no you don't know better. I was the one there. Shut up.
"
37,"""Pretend every other driver on the road is an absolute idiot, and you'll do fine.""

It's definitely worked! 

EDIT: Shout out to all the times we did math together. I actually love math (algebra, mostly) and I doubt I would if it wasn't for him."
38,"I'll fess up-I do this. It's the piece I use to wipe any drops off the seat. Sometimes it's just water that splashes back from the flush, but I don't want the next person to have to sit on that. "
39,Great way to have sex without any risk of having an orgasm.
40,"Anything that gives numericals to dictate whether someone likes you or doesn't like you. Like ""if he doesn't call in three days, he doesn't like you"". Or ""if he doesn't ask to be your boyfriend after X dates, he doesn't like you."" Every situation and every person is different, you can't apply math to human relationships."
41,"The worst part is when you point out the work you do and they retort, ""well, I didn't ask you to."" 

HOW ABOUT SOME FUCKING GRATITUDE. My SO does this sometimes and it makes me feel so unappreciated. Yes, he's not asking me to do these things but it doesn't take a genius to realize that they're good, helpful things to do that benefit him in some way. "
42,"""I like you. You're not like other girls""

Grrr, this makes me irrationally annoyed. "
43,"My sister deliberately didn't tell me her husband had invited me to lunch with Kevin Smith. I was on vacation and he worked in television. I was a big fan at the time. Her husband asked why I hadn't turned up later that day. She decided she wanted to go shopping instead (which I fucking hate) and even pitched a hissy fit when I wanted to go to a comic book store, which we don't have in small town Ireland. I'm not the type that usually gives a shit about celebrities, even ones I like, but after that day she stopped being my sister and is now just a person I have to speak to every once in awhile. "
44,"Wtf is with the obsession with hobbies? Why is having a hobby considered so essential, but your definition of what constitutes a hobby so narrow? Why can't you just be into something without making it a weird pseudo-competitive hobby thing? "
45,"""Everything happens for a reason."" 

They mean everything happens for a *good* reason, which I don't believe in. I've been hearing this a lot lately because I got laid off three weeks ago. Current least favorite platitude. "
46,"I really hate the armchair diagnostics. Personality disorders in particular get thrown around like confetti under the criteria of ""this person seems sucky from your description.""  This works towards increasing the stigma of these, which in turn makes seeking and getting treatment harder. It makes people associate disorders with only assholes and writes them all off as if no one does seek treatment for them. Unless you are medically caring for someone, stop diagnosing. If the OP has things that indicate an issue that might need treatment, guide them to seek that. If someone is describing someone and that person seems awful, use that or some synonyms, not a medical diagnoses. A medical diagnoses is not a damn adjective. "
47,"The word ""no"" does not mean ""try again with more persistence.""  "
48,"It sucks that he wasnt into you, but he wasnt an asshole at least
"
49,A lot of very average men think they're something special and women should cater to them. You're not.
50,"My doctor excused himself, made it to the door, and dropped to the floor. He had a heart attack."
51,"My absolute favorite is ""poetic, noble land mermaid!‚Äù"
52,"&gt; The ring bear

This story becomes funny instead of frustrating if you imagine this exchange happening with a literal bear."
53,"Stop telling me to smile. I am not your aesthetic entertainment. And if this is your way of flirting, it makes women feel like objects, and therefore makes you seem like a creep. Fuck off."
54,"&gt;Some women just really don't like other women, and there isn't always a good reason. In my personal experience, women who fall into this category are usually insecure and don't like to be part of a circle that includes other women because they like being special or the ""token girl"" of the group. I try to avoid women like this because they often tend to be nasty to other women.

This was me as a kid. It took going to college to realize how messed up it was. I grew up thinking that ""girly"" things were lame and stupid, and ""boy"" things were cool and desirable. My mom was a big part of it. She had always identified as an ""honorary guy,"" and between that and having a younger brother who was always insanely popular sort of drove me away from girls. Heck, it took me finding out that alcohol tastes super shitty to stop calling drinks that tasted good ""bitch beer.""

My mom's gotten better since I've started calling her on stuff now, too. And friends are way easier to make and maintain when you don't care about how you present yourself to others. (Don't put down things that other people like, for example.) 

It was a reinforcing stereotype as a kid, too. I thought I was too cool to hang out with other girls, so they thought I was stuck up (I was) and were mean to me in return. So I thought all girls must be like that. My closest friends are a mix of men and women now. I like to think it's something that people grow out of.

Edit: I like this sub because I can admit that I was a shitty teenager and nobody is giving me a hard time for it. &lt;3"
55,"When I got pregnant with my first my new midwife did a full exam. She told me I had perfect breastfeeding nipples. When I laughed she tried to explain and I stopped her saying she didn't need to. I was raised on a farm and I had played lactation consultant to many goats, cows, etc. I told her the different difficulties I dealt with and was fully aware that nipple size/shape/location made a difference in nursing. I talked about the other factors too. She was shocked and thought breastfeeding issues were only a human thing.

I got to teach her something. It was kind of cool. "
56,"When I was in college, I went on a date with this guy who insisted on buying me jewelry during the date, despite the fact that I can't wear jewelry due to allergies. I told him multiple times how uncomfortable this made me and that the gift would be wasted, but he bought it anyway and asked me to wear it. I tried it on, and predictably had an allergic reaction. 

There was no second date. "
57,"I call one of my close girlfriends ""Most Precious and Beautiful [Her Name]"" as a nickname. I did it for ages before I ever saw Parks &amp; Rec and then when I finally saw the show I just thought Leslie Knope was my total spirit animal, in terms of her friendship with Ann Perkins at least. "
58,Tell them you're not and watch them recede into a ball of awkwardness. Enjoy it :P
59,"I was chased through the woods by a kidnapper when I was a little girl for a couple miles.  

Also, a separate incident near the same place.  

When I was a teenager, I used to go out camping by myself. I had a spot where I liked that was across a few fences from my Grandparent's house in the middle of nowhere.

One of the places I cut through was a pasture full of cattle. Around cattle, especially cattle unfamiliar with me, I try to be very careful to not spook them but otherwise cows are pretty easy going. This was about a mile from my Grandparent's house and probably about two from my destination.

The one time I am thinking of(the last time), I slipped through the fence to find the cattle already freaked out. They were insanely agitated about something I was not aware of, so I stayed well clear of them as I went through the pasture.

I had a good time camping that night and packed up the next morning. As I went back into that pasture, however, there was this ridiculously bad smell. It smelled like a skunk had fought with something in a fertilizer barrel of shit and the barrel broke open. It was awful. I tried to look around for the cows to make sure they were not going to surprise me and I could not find them. They were just gone. There was some brush and trees, though, so I thought they were just out of sight.

I keep walking through the place to get home and the smell is so bad that I set down my stuff at the fence line and decide to investigate.

Well, I found the cows. All of them were shot and ripped apart. Someone had carefully shot them in the head with a bolt gun style thing(or hit them hard enough with a pointy object to bust through their skulls) and eviscerated all of them. They had also drug them all into a little shallow ravine and piled the bodies up. It was horrible. 

I hightailed it out of there back to my gear. My stuff was gone. As in, I set it right here on this rock and it is not within eyeshot. A quick glance showed me there was not anything ripped or fallen out, so something(someone) had picked it up while I was 200 yards away for less than 5 minutes.

I think Usain Bolt would not have been able to catch me on the way home. I never heard anything else about those cows and I did not go back to the old camping spot again.

"
60,"That's so bad. I had a guy say ""I wanna fuck the shit out of you right now"" in the middle of our first beer ever."
61,"&gt; ""Reddit could probably stand to calm down.""

In my experience, Reddit likes to call people out in the harshest possible ways, and when those people stand up for themselves (even if only to politely explain away some sort of misunderstanding), the response they receive is akin to this:

*""Why do you feel it is appropriate to argue with those who took time out of their day to offer you their perspective? You asked for honest answers, you got them - stop bitching and moaning about the response you received just because it wasn't what you wanted to hear. Has it ever occurred to you that maybe you're wrong, and the people you're arguing with have a perfectly valid point? You say you're 24 years old - start acting like it. If you can't learn to take a little (well-deserved) criticism, you're going to lead a very miserable existence.""*"
62,"If you don't know how to do laundry, wash dishes,  cook a basic meal, clean or buy groceries that aren't just beer and chicken wings *I think less of you*. These are basic aspects of being a somewhat functional adult and you should know how to do them. 

If you actually try to *fake not being able to* so I get stuck doing it all for you? Deliberately sabotage yourself and ruin my/your/our things? You'll be out on your ass faster than you can blink. I don't need or want a child, much less one that's fully grown. "
63,"&gt; I don't care if you find me attractive or not. My life's worth is not measured by how hard I can make your dick.

That reminds me of a pic I saw of three of the US Gymnastics Olympians wearing bikinis, displaying their rock-hard six-packs, to which a guy said something to the effect of ""does anyone find this attractive?""

It's like, dude... they're the fucking LITERAL BEST IN THE WORLD at something. They just represented our entire nation and CRUSHED the competition. What has your lame ass ever done in your fucking life? They didn't do all that just so you'd want to fuck them."
64,"When I was in seventh grade I wanted to join the wrestling team. The teacher who was recruiting made a point of letting everybody know that it was open to girls too, and it was really fun, and the coaches wouldn't let any shenanigans go on with boys ""accidentally"" touching you inappropriately or anything. So I got all excited and I grabbed a flyer and when I got home I begged my parents to let me sign up.  
  
  Well, my mom was all for it, but my dad said I couldn't. Not because I'm a girl or anything, but because I was too small. I was short and skinny and he didn't want me getting hurt. Even when I told him there would be weight classes so I wouldn't be wrestling anybody too much bigger than me, he still said it was too dangerous.  
  
  A couple hours later, my dad and my little brother walked out the front door. I asked where they were going, just because I was curious, and they said they were going to the wrestling meeting. I asked if I could go, and my dad said again that I was too small. I pointed out that my brother was AN INCH SHORTER THAN ME, and my dad waffled and bullshitted for a minute before finally telling me that he doesn't want his daughter wrestling. He was worried that guys would grab my boobs or something while we were wrestling because ""I know how boys are at that age, HenryVIIISucks.""  
  
  I told him that the teachers weren't going to let anybody harass me, and that if they did I'd take them down with my new wrestling moves. I told him that other girls were signing up and I'd probably be wrestling those other girls most of the time anyways, because most of the boys were bigger than me. He didn't want to hear it. He made me stay at home while he brought my brother to the wrestling meeting. And then my brother decided not to join anyways, so I couldn't even live vicariously through him or watch some of the matches and point out to my dad how good some of the girls there were and how maybe he should let me sign up next year so I could get as good as them, and look, nobody's even grabbing them, because like I already TOLD YOU, the coaches and referees aren't going to let that happen."
65,"My first ever visit to the gyno was when I was 16. I was sitting with my ankles in the stirrups and the doctor's head between my knees, and she was trying to make me more comfortable by making small talk and asking questions: hobbies, family, etc...

Doc: So what school do you go to?

Me: [local high school]

Doc: Oh, really? My son goes there! Do you know [absurdly handsome all-star athlete with perfect grades around whom most of the girls would collapse into a giggling, blushing heap]?


Me, mortified:

^^^yes
"
66,"So many of the ones on here I completely agree with. Also going to add that when a man comments on how ""tired"" or ""sick"" I look on a day where I decided not to put on makeup I want to tell them that this is how they look all the time and to shut the fuck up. But I usually just roll my eyes and walk away."
67,Everyone dresses up like they're going to the gym here lately. 
68,"as someone who dreamed about owning a Cupcake shop in the early 00's and now thinks about a food truck this made me laugh out loud!
"
69,"Like 90% of the time I start being friends with a guy. Even if they know I'm engaged. It's frustrating and sad. Sometimes it's just a crush and it passes, but most of the time they're becoming my friends specifically to get me to be their girlfriend and make me leave my fianc√© or at least cheat on him with them.

People suck. This kind of things keeps me from making friends, on top of my social anxiety."
70,"*Gasp* but...that's so shallow! If you just give him a chance to get to know him you'll look past his looks and fall in love with his heart, right?

My God this is horrible advice. Yes, attraction is fluid -- probably more so than people give credit for. But nonphysical compatibility can only take you so far. In my case, I ended up with a deep fondness toward him, but if he jumped into bed with another chick in front of me, I'd feel nothing more than disappointment.

Don't do this to yourself. The other person deserves better too."
71,"Learning to weld was for boys. Girls had to sew.

This was told to me by the theater professor at my first college when we were building a really cool set that involved some of the crew learning to weld. I was told that girls didn't weld and sent down to the costuming room to sew sandbags.

It worked out for the best since it spurred me to a) transfer colleges and b) get out of theater in general and start a different and ultimately rewarding path. But holy Jesus was it infuriating. "
72,"""You perfectly androgynous little fucking chipmunk""

My wife, describing Bruno Mars."
73,"Oh, and to clarify before moaning - I'm not talking about looking, I'm talking about gawking like I'm not a real person. I look at attractive men too, I don't stare directly at them for long periods without saying something, especially when I'm like 2 feet away, that's seriously uncomfortable. "
74,"Went on a date with a guy and it was very obviously a date because he said, ""hey, want to go on a date with me and get some coffee?"" So we went. Anyways, we're sitting at the local starbucks and some girl walks in. He looks over at her and says, ""oh wow! That's that girl from my calc class. She's so hot!"" I was like wtf. "
75,Yes!! Why do we get to be the crazy emotional ones when a lot of guys just fly off the handle but still be logical? This pisses me off so much
76,"My SO's mother and father asked me if it was okay if *they* wanted a paternity test, after he explicitly told them that we had been having monogamous sex for three months before I got pregnant. 

My SO knows without a doubt that it is his, and his parents reply? *We're glad to hear you're confident, and we'll just table that for later.*"
77,Escape rooms. They're popping up all over the place.
78,"In addition to #2:

I'm being polite to you because that is literally in my job description and I am at my place of work, not because I want to suck your cock. "
79,"It's annoying as shit that so many of you (if we're directly addressing men here) feel like you have a free pass to not care or learn about female anatomy. The whole ""I will never learn about periods because they're disgusting and they don't pertain to me"" shit is tired. At a certain age you should know certain basic things about periods, pregnancy, etc. The whole ""no one ever told me so I don't know"" excuse doesn't fly at 25 years of age, especially in the Internet era.
"
80,"Happens to be me more often than I'd like to admit. Some adults, some of the kids I work with.

My favorite was a little girl, probably about 6, who asked me if I was pregnant. I told her it was all cupcakes and cookies, and she stuck her belly out and said ""me too.""

Adults that ask, I tell them I'm just fat. They did it to themselves and deserve to feel that awkwardness. "
81,"&gt; Eating chocolate doesn't give me an orgasm

You might want to see a doctor about this."
82,"It was with a guy who worked for a government party, mostly centered around election stuff. Which was great! I am into politics and it's the party I vote for. However, that is *literally* all he talked about. Occasionally he'd randomly ask me a closed ended question like ""do you have siblings?"" And I'd go ""yeah, a brother and sister -"" and he'd sort of nod, pause awkwardly, and launch right back into talking about work and politics. Then about 20 minutes in he said ""so, just so you know, I have issues with depression and I'm into BDSM. Just in case we end up in a serious relationship."" This was literally 20 minutes into meeting me. Then he went right back to talking about politics. Also, the place he'd picked was a very trendy microbrewery restaurant, but it was super awkward because you share long picnic tables. So we were sandwiched by strangers have the most awkward first date ever. At one point I realized he knew a friend of mine who also worked there, and when I went to pee, I texted her. She immediately responded ""omg. Get out of there."" The whole date was definitely under an hour.

Then there was the time where the date was mediocre but fine, I would've gone out with him again. But then he texted me a few hours later, after midnight. To tell me he was sorry if he was being shy or awkward... But he was distracted by my boobs. He literally said ""holy crap, your boobs."" So I just laughed and laughed and never responded. "

Soooo much of that stuff *isn't* something that is asked of me, but it matters. And, if we neglected it, they'd sure think I don't keep a good home. So, no, male-roommates, you DIDN'T ask me to. But that doesn't mean it doesn't contribute a net positive or matter in some way! "

I've had guys ask me questions and then try to argue every single one of my answers, even opinions like my favorite color or animal.

I've had guys that only talked about themselves for the entire date, including interrupting me to talk more about themselves. 

I had one guy introduce me as his girlfriend when we ran into somebody he knew....on the first date.

I had a guy grab the bill before I had a chance to, and then inform me that he would only be paying half and I would need to cover the rest. (I've fine with splitting, I actually prefer it but it was SO tacky to tell me to do so before I had a chance to even offer).

I had a guy spend most of the date about how my job was pointless and not contributing to society and I should focus on important things and not things that don't matter. "

93,"In middle school, I had a math teacher who everyone adored. He was funny, actually kept up with pop culture, and kind of looked like Santa. Just a very likable person, except he genuinely believed that girls couldn't do math. Most of the time, this belief of his was insidious; he'd sigh and say things like ""You tried your best"" when a girl fucked up a whiteboard problem, and admitted he graded the girls easier because math was so hard for them, and it was unfair to grade them as harshly as the boys. He only came out and said it once, when a girl asked about math in college and he responded with, ""Don't worry about that. Girls can't hack it in upper-level mathematics. You should stick to English classes."" 

I can't explain how damaging this was. It sounds silly, but he was so respected and we took his word as fact. I spent the next decade convinced that I was naturally bad at math because I was a girl. I stopped trying in my math and science classes because I ""knew"" I would never be good, and channeled all my energy toward my other classes. It sucked, because I got really interested in computer science as an adult, and I have years of learning to catch up on.

There was one more thing, much less of a big deal, that also happened in middle school. I liked computer games and wanted to join the Games Club, but it was all boys and they told me that girls weren't allowed in the club. I called them assholes and stormed away. (That was also the first time I ever swore!) And then I never got into gaming, so I guess their insult worked.

To add insult to injury, he would never let me drive it because I wasn't ""experienced"" enough, and would make fun of me for not knowing how to drive very well. 

It was 6 years ago and I'm still pissed. It's not even about the car itself; it's about the fact that he lied to my grandmom to get the car, then lied to me so he could keep it.

Up to the week before the wedding, he was still insisting that he'd come (it was across the country). He never came (obviously) and just texted my husband ""Sorry Im not there. Congrats"" on our wedding date. I don't care that he couldnt get the money to come - but I'm pissed that he never admitted it and dropped out at ANY point over the course of a year and a half. My husband bought a really nice groomsman gift for him, and was emailing him every few months to check in and update him on wedding stuff and the guy never once said he was having issues. That one will burn deep inside me for a very long time (we have since not spoken, seen or bothered to even FB like anything that has to do with him).

102,"Internalised misogyny. We all grow up being shown that all things feminine are weak and inferior, and some women grow up rejecting femininity as a result. They often perceive other women as ""bitchy"" and/or buy into the stereotype that being female makes you inherently drawn to drama and over-emotional situations, which are things they want to distance themselves from. They don't want to be lumped in with that group and so they actively try to differentiate themselves and make sure people know they're ""not like other girls"" and they don't befriend women because they don't participate in drama. Most people grow out of this over time, with more real world experience.

Note: Not all non-feminine women reject femininity as a whole or are misogynistic. "

There is nothing wrong with taking some time for yourself. Get a sitter, get a massage, drink some wine, scroll Reddit while the kids play. You will be a better mom for it, and your kids will appreciate a happier mom.

I spent a couple hours at school that day learning how to Heely from my friends who had had them as kids, and then I Heelyd around school the rest of the day. I felt so cool and dorky at the same time, but most of all I just felt loved by my friends. That was one of my favorite gifts I've ever gotten, and I still have those Heelys somewhere in my house.

Two awful things happened:

1. I asked the pastor if he could ask his congregation if anyone would be willing to adopt our 2 cats since we were moving. His exact quote was ""We don't help animals.""

2. My stepsister was too distraught to deal with any of her mom's belongings and wanted to throw them away.  I was asking the church group about expensive items my sister might want to keep or sell **so she would have the money.** I took some of the items to my bio mom's place to store until she was ready for them.  Well adults from the church group showed up at my mom's when I was alone, barged in after I opened the door, and demanded I give them the belongings. I didn't know what to do so I excused myself to call my mom and they went through the house and found her stuff. Removed all of it and left. 
They then told my step-sister I was trying to steal the stuff.  They also towed her mom's car off of my dad's property illegally. My dad actually bought the car but chose to not take action against them because he was still dealing with his wife of ~15 years' suicide.

When we got there, the (female) director asked me what I'd like to try playing, and I told her I really wanted to learn drums. Before she could respond, my mom cut in and said I didn't have any rhythm, and besides, drums were a boy thing.

The director asked what else I was interested in, and I listed - trumpet, tuba, and euphonium. Again, my mom interrupted to say that those were all ""boy instruments"" (which was kind of why I liked them, honestly) and I needed to pick something more suited to a girl.

Rather than try to argue with my mom, the director (who was a trumpet player herself) tried to compromise by suggesting French Horn. That was fine by my mom's standards, and I reluctantly agreed, but I never really got over the negative experience. I had no love for the instrument and refused to practice at all. When I did put in effort a couple times, I passed auditions and even got first chair once or twice, but I never could really care about it. I played for 6th-8th grade but quit before high school."

Now, I was nursing,  so I kept a night light on in our room, so I could wake up to feed w/o turning on a light. We both collapsed onto our bed in sheer exhaustion.  But when I opened my eyes for a moment, I saw this thing floating above our bed. I blinked a few times, and stared hard trying to figure out what it was. It was Smokey black, swirling,  organic ball of dark transparent something.  Like black smoke in a bottle. I wasn't scared at all, I just couldn't understand what my eyes were seeing.  I poked my husband and said ""What the fuck is that?!"" He rolled over, opened his eyes and said ""what? That black thing floating above us? I dunno."" And he rolled back over and fell back asleep! 

Now that I knew I wasn't just seeing things, I couldn't take my eyes off of it. I stared at it until it dissolved into the ceiling.

152,"This happened to my mom, but she told me the story often and it always scared the shit out of me. Apologies for the wall of text!

My mom and her friend lived in Miamiville Ohio and had friends that lived in Mariemont, maybe 5-6 miles away. My grandma had driven them to Mariemont earlier in the day but worked nights, so they had to find their own way home. So there they were, walking home on the shoulder of the road, when a young man pulls over and offers them a ride (this was back in the early 70s and hitchhiking was still very common). 

My mom remembers how handsome he was, and of course being 14-15 year old girls they jumped in the back of his van and told him where they were headed. My mom said how strangely the man was acting and how she had such an overwhelmingly bad feeling in the pit of her stomach, and then she noticed the gun on the front passenger side of the car. This wouldn't have been too unusual, being that many people they knew owned guns and the area was still fairly rural, except that they were driving along an unlit and heavily wooded area around 9pm with nobody else around  and the man started to slow down and pull the car over to the shoulder. My mom panics, grabs her friend's hand, throws the door open and they jump out of the van. 

They both tumble out onto the ground and my mom ends up splitting her knee open in the process (she's still got pieces of gravel in it to this day). They make a break for the woods and by this point the man has thrown the van into park and stepped out to chase after them with his gun. She says they barely made it to the treeline when he started shooting at them, and they scrambled up this hill on all fours and run as fast as they could through the woods until they found a little gully to hide in, all the while hearing gunshots and the man behind them. She said that the most terrifying part was trying to lay as still as possible and pace her breathing while listening to him get closer and closer. 

He eventually gave up looking and went back to his car, but she said they laid there for a long time after they heard him drive away, just in case. My mom said they told her friend's older brother about it when they got back but never reported it to police. She tells the story so nonchalantly now but it still scares me how close she came to being probably raped and murdered. "

174,"My first year of medical school I had a UTI. For some reason the cipro they gave me made me horrifyingly constipated to the point where I didn't have a BM in like 6 days, so I went to the hospital. The EM doctor was one of my professors and recognized me immediately. Given the UTI and abdominal pain, she decided to do a pelvic exam. Obviously, I was mortified. But it was made worse by her continuously pointing out our teacher-student relationship while inside me, giving me pointers about school, talking about our class etc. I know she was probably just trying to connect with me, but I would have preferred if we just kept it impersonal. Especially given how much pain I was in--come on, nobody wants to be sucking up to a prof while said prof is fingering your vag, it's like some kind of lame porno.

The real kicker is that she chose a chaperone whom I didn't know at the time but turned out to be another medical student from another year. Weeks later I was shadowing in the ED and the guy loudly announced ""OH HEY I remember you, you are that one girl we did the pelvic exam on!"" I wanted to shoot him.

I even kept turning my music up a little louder - and a few times he *turned it down* when he said he couldn't hear me that well like *it's my fucking car and I'm driving I get to decide the volume of the goddamn music also I'm not saying shit because you're just talking constantly so who gives a fuck*."

195,"I used to play with a little girl named Stella in my great grandmothers back yard on a regular bases. She lived in a neighborhood where the houses were fairly far apart, the yards were huge and covered in willow trees.  We would try to swing from the trees, play in the gardens and lure the ducks in the pond closer to us. I always assumed she was a neighbor,  I never had to go get her to play. She was always just there. I didn't think anything of it.


Recently my great grandmother hasn't been doing well, we've been going through her pictures and I found a really old one of someone who looks disturbingly like Stella, it brought back memories. I was asking about her, and no one could recall me ever playing with another girl, apparently I was always in the yard adventuring by myself. The girl in the picture however was my great grandmothers older sister, of four kids only two of them survived past the age of five.

So instead of hitting me he would punch himself in the face or bash parts of his body into hard objects if I did something that made him angry.  He broke bones, bruised himself, and bled profusely during these episodes.  I put up with this and would cry and beg and apologize, anything to get him to stop.  It makes me sad to remember how terrified I was and how I just meekly went along with it.

Job hunting sucks balls, there's no getting around it. But no one, except for dead people, is jobless forever. "
204,"First of all, straight up, their dollar a pound pasta is amazing. It's imported, good stuff, and super cheap.

Now, my other staples: the spanakopita and the chicken gyoza (with the dipping sauce and toasted sesame oil), from the frozen foods. The waffles are good too. The ten-minute barley and farro bags are insanely useful, and the harvest blend cous cous is great when cooked in stock. They have sprouted tofu which is great for punching up ramen, and a good sriracha. The beans are good, and cheap, and I used to be a huge fan of their lentil soup (til I started making my own more often than not). I'm recently obsessed with the honey-sesame cashews.

Cheese deserves its own section. Their Toscano cheeses are great--cinnamon crusted when in season, black pepper the rest of the time. The cave-aged mini Basque wheel is one of the best cheeses I've ever had in my life. The mini goat Brie wheel is a staple. The new sheep's milk cheese with olives is pretty phenomenal. I love the manchego. Their burrata is quite good. The herbed feta is great for salads. The goat gouda is great for snacks, as well as for pizza (pizza with kale pesto and goat gouda, mmmm). The Unexpected Cheddar is good for snacks, and for soups. The Caramelized Onion cheddar is the bomb for grilled cheese. I really love TJ cheese.

The quick-cook steel-cut oats are a great breakfast. I also like the maple-frosted miniwheats.

The stuffed grape leaves are delicious and vegan, but beware--they're packed in (strangely tasty) soy oil, not olive oil. Which is heartbreaking, as someone who tries to avoid soy for health reasons.

Their spices are pretty damn good, especially any seasonal holiday stuff. Last year they had this pack of tins of North African/Middle Eastern spices (Ras al Hanout, Zhoug, Pilpelchuma, and Sumac), and I've used the hell out of them. They even have black garlic! Get it, and die from joy. And the mustards! The mustards. I make a habit of buying the holiday quartets they sell, but just for me. And the new chili lime seasoning they recently released is so good you could just eat it alone. I've been putting it on ERRYTHANG.

The pane guttiau, aka music paper crackers, is also really good. Just that, some brie, and some grapes, and omg you're set. If the truffle salami ever comes back, buy it. Buy all of it. Unless you live in Philly, and then don't buy any of it, I will buy it all. -_-

The swing-top ginger brew at the holidays is very tasty. I live and die for both their half-and-half tea-and-lemonade, and the hibiscus cranberry juice.

The green tea mints, and the cocoa-dusted truffles that come in the red box.

Oh god I need to stop. But, uh, yeah, I love Trader Joe's."

207,"So I had been texting and chatting with a guy I had ""met"" on okcupid for a few weeks, but he lived a couple hours away from me. He said he was coming to my area for the weekend to go camping and we should meet up for our first date. I agreed. When I showed up at the campsite though, I was more than a little surprised to find out that it wasn't just him camping, or even him and a buddy or two! Oh no, it was him and his *entire family*!! Parents, aunts, uncles, cousins, second cousins...family from all over the country flown in for their annual family reunion!!! So not only is this the first time I'm meeting HIM, then he starts introducing me around to his entire immediate and extended family. And he has a huge family. Wtf. 

Later at dinner I called him out on it, asked him why he didn't tell me why his whole family was there. And why I had to meet all of them, and how uncomfortable it made me. He apologized, said he didn't mention it because he didn't think think it was a big deal, that it wasn't worth mentioning, and he didn't think I'd mind. But that he was incredibly sorry that it bothered me. We're still together a year later, so I guess all's well that ends well? Haha. "
208,"It's odd for me, because my father is basically a lesson in what *not* to do. So, in a weird-ass way he taught me how to be a decent (for the most part) person by showing me what *shouldn't* be done. There are times when I ask myself, 'what would he do?' then I'll do the opposite. "

213,"""You'll find him when you stop looking."" 

Okay, sure, but what does that actually mean?? I'm sure it's an attempt to tell anxiety riddled daters to just relax and have fun and stop putting so much pressure on themselves to hunt down their forever partner; but it implies some sort of magical correlation between relationship success and apathy induced coincidence."
214,"I feel like having thick skin and being decent aren't mutually exclusive. Yea, we should try being nicer to each other, but maybe don't take insults from strangers to heart. "
215,"Last night I went on a first Tinder date, and the guy was 30 minutes late, but texted me ""Trust me, I have a good excuse"", and then I see him WITH THE BIGGEST RED ROSES BOUQUET I HAD EVER SEEN. I wanted to die.

Also, he was supposedly 6'2 according to his profile. In real life, he was EXACTLY my height (I'm 5'9 and was wearing my thinnest flat sandals).

He also mentioned many ideas for second and third date, which made me REALLY uncomfortable.

To summarize, if you don't want a second date: 

- do an overly intense gesture that will make you look crazy / psycho / desperate 

- lie about your height (WE CAN ALWAYS TELL!!!!!!!!!) 

- talk about dates 2 and 3 before date 1 is even over 

- be 30 minutes late

Edit to add:

- talk about pee/poop

219,"Actually, *Blue is the Warmest Color* is based on a graphic novel written by a lesbian woman. Julie Maroh is her name, and she has written a piece about how after selling the rights to her novel the director failed to invite her to the set, to any premiers and award shows, refused to answer her emails and basically gave her no thanks other than adding her name onto the credits. She also talks about how she felt like the lesbian sex scenes failed to depict how lesbian sex actually is, and that they were too pornographic and made to fit the male gaze.

223,"He talked about his ex. The entire time. They had dated for 4 years and had broken up 2 years prior to this date yet somehow he managed to shoehorn her into every single story.

Also at the beginning of dinner I warned him that I had some food intolerances which had a tendency to make me drowsy if I ate too much fructose, and if I started to yawn a lot, I'd need to go home. 3 hours into the date, I start yawning and he has the nerve to fucking *pout*. Accused me of faking my food intolerances as an excuse to leave early. Again: 3 hours.

The next day I outlined all the above as the reason I didn't want to go on another date and he had the fucking audacity to cry Friendzone. When I said my friendship wasn't a consolation prize (and also not on offer), he tried to mansplain to me how I didn't understand what Friendzone really meant and that I should just go out with him again.

If you are lucky you will both continue to like each other then, and, if you are really lucky, they'll be employed, self-sufficient, law-abiding and won't marry someone who is a complete asshole.

230,"The main reason I'm a regular on askwomen is because standard reddit advice has so much underlying misogyny behind it. The woman is always wrong, she's always trying to manipulate some poor man, she's definitely cheating, she's doing what women always do, she should be sexier/more chill/less herself, women suck, they hate you because they're superficial.

As such, it would be a hilariously bad idea to install one permanently in my life and render myself unable to return them to their rightful caretakers once I'm over the interaction. Going through pregnancy would also be unusually miserable for me, and risky for the child, due to medical issues, but that's really just sprinkles.

When I'm in a relationship, which doesn't stop people, sometimes it becomes platonic but since I've been single, I haven't been able to make any platonic male mates. Even when I've bluntly said that I all I want is friendship and I am not dating it goes on deaf ears. I've made plenty of work friendships and female friends but any chap I've met eventually will show alternative motives. I like to have both male and female friends goddamnit.

I just wasn't aware yet of the obstacles ahead of me, so I was stunned and angered when I learned I was welcome to join the Air Force, but I would never be permitted to fly a plane. Because I was female. That was the end of my military aspirations, which in retrospect, was probably the best thing that happened to me, given all the stories that surfaced later about women being raped in the military."

238,"I've been on many dates with guys I've met online, but I had one that was so bad that the only thing getting me through it was the fact that I could tell the story about it afterwards. We met up at a crowded coffee shop and as soon as he arrived, I could immediately tell that something was off.  He (I‚Äôll call him ‚ÄúNick‚Äù) didn't smile at all when he introduced himself and his eyes seemed to be very intense and lacking any real emotion. Then we got in line for coffee and he said, ""Actually I don't like coffee,"" so I added ""Me neither, I prefer tea."" Then he said, ""Me too! Well, that makes sense since did you know we're a 99% match?"" I cringed, awkwardly laughed, and hoped that no one around had heard him say this (they almost certainly did). 

Then, there were no available tables inside so I suggested we sit outside.  He didn‚Äôt respond and instead approached a guy who was sitting at a 4-person table by himself doing homework with textbooks spread out all over the table to ask if we could share with him...This high-school guy then had to try and move all of his stuff to one side of the table and I ended up sitting right next to him and across from Nick.  

Once we started talking, he constantly referred to things he‚Äôd seen ‚Äúon my profile‚Äù to ask me questions about them. I mentioned that I was British and then Nick put on an absolutely god awful attempt at a British accent to try and get me to use mine. I thought he would laugh after doing so but he was dead serious and I don‚Äôt know if he was joking or not.  Eventually the high-school guy moved tables when another one opened up and I‚Äôm sure he was overjoyed to escape the awkwardness.

After what seemed like an eternity Nick said ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt have any more questions for you.‚Äù  Needless to say, I did not go out with him again."
239,"Ugh. My previous gyno was checking my incision sites after my laparoscopy (for endometriosis diagnosis) and commented that the scars will be small and definitely not noticeable with ""all that hair down there *chuckle*"".

241,"The date started off fine, he seemed like a normal college student. 

But somehow towards the end of the date he decided that we had known each other enough time for him to ask about my masturbation habits, and when I didn't respond he began to mention how he was a photographer, who takes nude photos for a blog and asked if I'd be willing to model since my body shape was so ""interesting"" to him.

I left the date early, and never contacted him again.

253,"I am 100% convinced I was *almost* the victim of either a raping, murder, or similar. 

During my first year in college, I was visiting a friend who lived in an area of the city known for its high crime rate. We were sewing a project together for class one evening, and I remembered I had my nice [Gingher fabric shears](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UU6SR4/ref=s9_acsd_hps_bw_c_x_1) out in my car. 

I went out to get them, and entered my car through the driver's side but the shears were on the passenger's side seat in a bag. I found them immediately and was holding them pointy side up in my hand. I then backed out of my car to shut the door, and as I turned to do so there was a guy standing right there! Less than a foot away! 

I was shocked, and he acted surprised as well. I was still holding my large shiny metal shears, and I probably let out some sort of squawk of surprise. He looked surprised as well, even though he's the one who snuck up on me! He just quickly darted away, and that was it.

I'm convinced if I wasn't holding those shears, he would have tried something on me. 

Later that same year, a girl was raped in her upstairs apartment of my friend's house. (Same friend I was visiting, same house.) A guy followed her in the door as she was entering her place."
254,"I'd always thought one of my childhood friends' father was scary and didn't like seeing him, much less speaking with him. We carpooled though, so it was unavoidable.

256,"I was one of those women that got burned by toxic friends.  This especially happened in high school, but I actually managed to acquire some really great female friends in college.  Now that I'm a mom in my 30's I have tons of female friends, many of whom are moms as well.  In fact I only have a few toxic drama ridden friends now who are actually old high school friends that never really grew up.  My guess is that maturity cancels out toxicity and drama.  "
257,"When we first met, my SO ate like a wolf.  He was raised in a red-meat-loving household, and he legitimately believed that a steak was a meal in itself.  He'd buy meat on the bone, cook it, and then pick it up with his hands and tear the meat off with his teeth.  When he was done, he'd split the bone and suck out the marrow.  And he had this way of positioning himself around his plate in a very...uh, territorial(?) looking way.

Anyway, I think it was the result of being raised by a single father in a house full of brothers.  He had a lot of habits that seemed kind of rough initially, but it was really just lack of exposure to anything different.  The first time I took him to a farmer's market, he was running around like a kid in a candy store, amazed at having not seen a lot of the fruits and vegetables before---  He's a vegetarian now :)

259,"Hello there! I do freelance digital illustration for a living. This ranges from contract work that can span months per project (some examples of this would be coloring comic book pages, or doing character design and spot illustrations for childrens books), to one off commissions for people. I work entirely digitally using programs like Paint Tool Sai and Photoshop.

My work day is... haha honestly a little more unstructured than I'd like, due to some health issues I've been dealing with the last few months. But on an ideal day, I wake up anytime from 8-10 and try to get to work before noon. I typically do some warmup doodling, or maybe do a speedpaint, which lasts for an hour or so. Then I have a look at the spreadsheets I keep track of my work on and determine what I want/need to work on that day. I work for a few hours, take a break to get some lunch and/or spend some time with my boyfriend. Basically rinse and repeat for the rest of the day. I try to work about 8 hours a day, but it really depends, on what's due when, or the rare occasion where I just feel driven as fuck to get a lot done.

I'm usually done by around 8 or 9 at night. After that, I may draw some more to wind down. I'm a bit of a fangirl, so I love doing fanart, so I usually reward myself with drawing whatever I'm interested in for a while. Or I may be 110% done with drawing and ready to jump away from my computer and have nothing to do with it haha

298,"It's totally okay to not be sure of what you want. In any area of life. It's only a problem if one tries to obtain something without knowing what it is they want. To quote from the book Fight Club (of which is sadly incredibly misunderstood):  ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt know what you want,‚Äô the doorman said, ‚Äòyou end up with a lot you don‚Äôt.‚Äù  

The advice I would give is as follows:

First, more important than anything else, masturbate. A lot. Touch yourself everywhere. Get to know you and your body and what feels good and what doesn't. Be comfortable and explore. Look with a mirror and a light. Look at [The Great Wall of Vagina](http://www.greatwallofvagina.co.uk/home) (even though it should be titled The Great Wall of Vulva, but I digress) because it is imperative that women know what natural female nudity looks like. Then peruse [The Gallery of Breasts](http://www.007b.com/breast_gallery.php) because what this does is give you, and only you, the power of body expectations. You will always know how normal and acceptable your body is and this can help your confidence immensely. So many women have intense insecurity over their breast, vulvas, and vaginas. 

Next, explore the wonderful world of the variety in which human beings phenotypically express genetic traits. Eye color, hair color and texture, facial features, body types, height, melanin levels. Get a sense of what you like and then prepare yourself to date people with none of those preferences (I like straight hair and out of the three serious relationships I've had, the first two had curly hair). Seriously, go on Google Images and just browse pictures of people. 

Another note of importance, sexuality. Not sexual orientation, but sexuality. I'm demisexual. I can look at the hottest guy in the world and find him incredibly attractive, yet have **zero** sexual desire or sexual attraction towards him. I can admire him like a painting, but nothing more. If you're like I was, without knowing about this, you'll waste a lot of time on a lot of crappy sex. If you can look at a stranger of your preferred sex and the bean begins to quiver, you're not demisexual. Yet, knowing your libido can be helpful in setting up expectations for a new relationship. Different libidos can function successfully in a relationship as long as both parties have proper expectations from the beginning.  

Next, think about the kind of life you want and the kind of relationship you want. People may disagree with this as you often cannot control who you have feelings for, however, I think it's important to discover how much the lifestyle you prefer matters in regard to your expectations and happiness. Love truly cannot conquer all and there are some big areas of life such as the desire for children, religion, desire to travel, desire for career vs enough money to live comfortably, that create irreconcilable differences. 

This is getting really long, if you would like, I can keep going, but I don't want to keep blabbering on if this isn't helpful!

**EDIT for continuance

Now, on to actually dating. Dating is fun and dating is scary, and frustrating, and exciting, and nerve-racking, and on and on. Don't set yourself up for disappointment by placing unrealistic expectations on first dates. So many first dates go badly because the people on them expect them to be something more than a first date is meant to be. Yet people date for different reasons, some for fun, some for sex, some for company, some are looking for serious relationships. Which do you want? All are perfectly acceptable as long as you make it clear what you are after. And it's okay to change your mind about how you want to date. Many people need to try something before they realize it's not for them. Others know right away that they don't want to waste time dating around casually and are only looking to meet others who want a serious relationship. 

If you don't know what you want, that's an answer too! ""I want to date but I'm not sure what I'm looking to get out of it."" Great! But set boundaries, instead of stressing yourself out trying to figure out what you do want, decide what you don't want. Sex? Kissing? Group/individual dates? Casual dating does not equal casual sex, not wanting something serious doesn't mean you have to be okay with sex. If you're open to sex, cool, use protection. Some people will respect your boundaries and some will see them as an obstacle or a challenge.  Be prepared for others to not know what they want or to flat out lie about their expectations or intentions. Don't let those people ruin your outlook of dating or other human beings. **It is never your fault for not being what someone else expected when you made your intentions clear beforehand.** Also, neither party owes each other anything besides showing up. A date is a date, it's not a contract for anything else. Neither of you owe each other a good time, because let's face it, compatibility and chemistry are not guaranteed. It's okay to end a date early and it's okay to stick it out to see if things turn around. People act weird when they get nervous. Try not to write someone off for saying something dumb. Which brings me to...

To be or not to be...yourself. When people advise others to ""just be yourself"", it's kind of a slap in the face to those who are struggling in the dating world when they *are* being themselves. It is okay to put your best food forward and downplay some of the quirky or weird or unique things about yourself until a little later down the road (you don't need to bare your soul or overshare to be considered honest). I am a *very* weird person, it's easier for others to accept the odd bits when they have time to develop affection for me through the more pleasant aspects of my personality (this goes for friendships, too). This is not to say it's okay to lie or pretend you like or dislike things when you really don't. If you go out on a date with someone who seems to live outside and doesn't own a TV, yet you haven't been camping since 1996 and consider Netflix binge watching the finest of Olympic sports, own it. Disagreement isn't a bad thing. It's okay to love beer and date someone who thinks beer is disgusting. Couples don't need to do everything together and having a hobby that only you enjoy is healthy. Everyone has personality flaws that we need to work on, we don't need to highlight those on a date, just like we wouldn't share our worst work habits on a job interview. You have time to get around to flaws later on down the road once you've established mutual interest in one another and decide you want to actually establish a relationship. These flaws should not be confused with deal-breakers. Be upfront about things like smoking or drinking, because it never goes well when strong opposition to these kinds of things only comes up three years into a relationship.

Lastly, people confuse playing games with understanding human psychology and how desire, mystery, and working for something matters. Messing with people is fucked up. But it is important to understand that people generally don't enjoy feeling like someone they just met is wrapped around their finger. If you're available, you're available, but don't stop making your old plans or enjoying your hobbies because you want to be available for someone else. It's not a bad thing to let a person earn all the lovely things about yourself that you have to offer, patience and delayed gratification are worth the investment. Lots of men and women enjoy having to put effort into attaining things, even if they don't even realize it consciously. There is no magical number determining how long one should wait to talk to someone again or ask them out again. With all this in mind, you can do everything ""right"" and some experiences will just be something out of *The Twilight Zone*. Don't beat yourself up about it. Infatuation will always pass. It feels so big and strong and all encompassing, but infatuation always fades. I would recommend spending a little time getting to know that little bugger named [infatuation](http://www.ilanelanzen.com/loveandrelationships/14-signs-its-infatuation-vs-love/) because it creates a lot of the disappointment and bad experiences in dating.

It's just really hard to entirely extricate oneself from a relationship. If I've become accustomed to being physically and emotionally intimate with someone, than my default will be to continue that pattern. I haven't ever had an SO that was friends with an ex, but some of my friends are either friends with an ex or dating someone who is. Almost without fail, that ex is the first person they turn to when things get rocky in the relationship. There's a constant comparison between the current relationship, and the friendship with the ex (and it's almost always unfavorable to the ongoing romance).

I'm sure there are people with healthy relationships and proper boundaries, and I can see a situation where - rationally - I shouldn't have any objection to friendship with an ex but... it just seems like such a needless hassle."

313,"My SO's mother decided right off the bat she didn't like me very much. That didn't bother me that much. What bothered me was that when she and my SO had a fight, she called my home (I lived an hour away and we were teenagers at the time) and yelled at my parents for raising such an awful person who controlled her baby with ""what's between [my] legs"". (Even if we were sexually active at the time, that was so uncalled for.) Because it was my fault he'd walked out (he hadn't even told me yet that they'd had a fight), and apparently I'd encouraged him. She also demanded that I make him come home (dude, he's sixteen and you've never gotten along. He'll come home when he cools down or when you call the cops, but I know him well enough to know that I'm not going to influence that decision.)

Then about two years ago, she really lashed out. We had to go to her house for some reason. It ended with me cornered in her kitchen while she screamed at me. I was a sl*t. I was a horrible influence. I would go out all night and call him from the bar drunk (I'd just come back from a language exchange a few weeks earlier, where most social activities were held at the bar because it was a small town and that was literally the only venue with a stage, tables and a dance floor. I found this accusation the most hilarious because even if I was getting drunk, which happened exactly once in the whole five weeks, I couldn't possibly have called him from the bar. This was partly due to the lack of phone signal but mostly because I would have been sent home if I'd been caught speaking in English and my SO doesn't speak French. So okay, lady. Go ahead and think that.) She hurled all sorts of insults at me that day and made it very clear she didn't think I was worthy of her son or her family. I was worthless because my parents used credit cards instead of cash for everything. All I ever talked about when she first met me was my ex (I don't remember it like that, but maybe. But this was also 5+ years earlier. And that's what she was hung up on. A sixteen year old with an ex-boyfriend.) My SO stepped in (literally. He put himself in the middle) once he recovered from the shock, because this came very out of nowhere, and got me out of the house. 

I avoided her permanently after that. Last year she invited us both for dinner and told me it was her olive branch and she wanted to give me another chance. Like she hadn't done anything and it was all me. I still hold a grudge over all of it. I'm civil with her for my SO's sake, because although he's limiting contact with her, he doesn't want to cut her completely out of his life and I respect that.

It's a show about a piemaker who can raise the dead by touching them and kill them again with another touch. If he lets them live, someone else dies. He uses this power to solve crimes.

For such a morbid premise, it's a really upbeat show. And visually stunning."
315,"Yes, he's friends with some girls who are very immature and rude. He's got a big friend group and they've all been friends for most of their school years, whereas I've only been with my SO for 2 years. I get along pretty well with most of his friends but these girls are awful. They don't talk to me if we're all out together, they're very loud, annoying and rude to the point that one girl actually clicked her fingers at me and referred to me as ""[SO]'s girlfriend"" despite knowing my name. Thankfully it's only 2 or 3 girls out of a large group so it's not too bad."

320,"I met a guy for coffee. Seemed all right. Not an hour after our coffee date, he messaged me a laundry list of ""musts"" that I had to fulfill for him to continue seeing me: birth control, no daddy issues, exclusive dating from the start--and, to take the cake, he flat-out asked me if I'd ever been raped or molested, because he would never date someone who had that experience in their past.

He then followed that up by asking me if I was seeing a mutual acquaintance.

Taken aback, I managed to tell him that it was none of his business, and that is where the conversation ended. I dated his brother for a while after that; he was much more mature. "
321,"yeah i've noticed guys only try to *actually just be friends with me* if we're stuck together bc of work/school, or if they are dating my friend/in another happy relationship. almost all other guys either would rather hook up, or have no interest whatsoever."
322,"Holy shit. Being a man, this just opened up my eyes. I never even entertained the possibility that someone might feel afraid of me. I don't even want people to be. And when you said,""it's entirely in your hands whether or not you choose to be violent to me"", chills up and down my spine."
323,"I don't like it when people call me skinny.  

I find that people feel the need to comment on women's figures and when they do, they are often trying to be complimentary, but they miss.

It's the ""Go on, have another donut, you can afford it, you are so skinny!"" 

I have been ill in the past, and I was undernourished for a while as a result.  I was skinny then.  For the vast majority of my life I have been healthy and a good weight for my size and I find it so rude that people comment at all.  It is no one else's business to comment on anyone else's body, and very few people ever make the effort to be polite about it.

Not being fat is not the same as being thin.  Thin/skinny is malnourished, bony, emaciated, pinched.  

Slender, slim, willowy, lean, any of that are more polite but still, why bother saying anything?

How many people use words that basically mean ""You look ill, and I should tell you!""

It is rather like calling a heavier person obese to their face.  ""Oh go on a diet you fatty"" is just like saying to a lighter person ""You should eat more, you're skinny!""

334,"Generally, in my opinion, it is some combination of internalized misogyny and personal prejudice because they see women as a homogenous group rather than as individuals. People usually recognize that it is prejudiced and inappropriate to say things like ""I don't get along with black people because I have a lot of ambition, don't like watermelon, and don't play basketball"" because they see the racism and generalizing stereotypes in that sentence, but it's common for some women to say things like ""I don't get along with women because I am drama-free, don't gossip, and am not girly"" without recognizing the sexism and stereotypes in their statement. 

In my experience, they've bought into the idea of gender roles strongly and consider themselves ""different from other women"" because they look at themselves vs the traditional ""ideal"" female gender role (including passivity, preoccupation with keeping a home, being perceived as feminine, being the second player supporting someone else's life) and they don't see themselves that way. Men are seen as primary characters in their own lives. In most areas of career and personal success, the male role is seen as the driver and better outcome for a person. The woman feels like she fits that role better because she is herself and has her own hobbies and ideas and passions. She relates those things to maleness, assumes that men will be more compatible with her, and creates a self-fulfilling prophecy where that is the case because she has dismissed women as a group, but judges men as individuals.

A while back, I was having blood in my stool. I went to the clinic, and when it was my turn, in walks one of the doctors I knew at the hospital! I could tell he was all ready to do a rectal exam, but when he opened the door and saw my face, he recognized me. He awkwardly greeted me, listened to my concerns, removed his gloves (without ever using them), and referred me to a gastroenterologist.

I also knew the gastroenterologist.

359,"I do a bit of charity work and sometimes rub elbows with the uber-rich. When I was younger and less experienced with ""the finer things,"" I sometimes felt a bit nervous that I would eat with the wrong fork or something. Whenever I was confronted with something for which I didn't know the etiquette, I followed the standard advice of waiting for other people to start and doing whatever they do. 

About 15 years ago I was at one of those 10k per table fundraiser dinners where the rubber chicken is shit but they try to fake you out with fine linens and way too much cutlery and such. I happened to be seated next to somebody whose name and occupation I forget, but who was much older, clearly in his element and not at all intimidated by the table setting and makeshift courses.  

I waited for him to start and then used the same fork for the same course and went on with my conversation. When the next course came out, we both realized at the exact same moment that we'd used the wrong fork. The moment we made eye contact, I couldn't help it. I broke into a grin and said ""thanks for taking me down with you on the fork decision!""

He laughed really hard, looked me up and down, leaned in and whispered conspiratorially, ""you're young, but you'll soon figure out that perhaps the biggest advantage of wealth is that every fork on this table is for whatever I say it's for.""  Then he winked and - get this - proceeded to eat the next course with A FORK HE HAD ALREADY USED. Scandal. 

I am not much of an elitist, at least not based on wealth, so I tried to separate the arrogance and absorb the advice, which at its heart is ""fuck the haters and do you, boo!""  It has served me well. "

370,"While we lived together, I constantly battled to get my first serious boyfriend to do even minimal household upkeep. He was a very upper middle class kid with a disability and overprotective stay-at-home moms in two ""traditional"" households (read: dad and stepdad never lifted a finger around the house). His family actually paid for a weekly maid service for his apartment, while he was an undergrad. To be clear, his disability in no way made him unable to take care of himself; he could do it perfectly fine when he actually had to. Most of the time, he just knew that eventually someone else would do the work for him. 

Needless to say, I found this infinitely infuriating, and we fought to no end over burning questions like why it was better to have your kitchen overrun by ants for days than to take 30 seconds to wash your dirty plates. 

About a month after I finally left, he texted me to ask how the washing machine worked. I'd spent several years trying to get him to run a load of laundry here and there, and had walked him through it in exhaustive detail on multiple occasions. I guess his long-suffering immigrant cleaning lady drew the line where I really ought to have, years ago. 

That was when ""must have lived alone successfully for significant amount of time"" became a knockout criterion for everyone I considered dating after that. "
371,"Once when I was ten years old I was in my school's choir. The lead singer had to drop out for some reason during mass that week so I was given all her solos (it was sort of an open secret that I was the more naturally skilled singer, but she was sort of the celebrity of the school so all the teachers just bent over backwards to have her stand out in some shape or form.) that night I mentioned to my mom that my throat hurt and that
I'd just go to bed early and sleep it off so I'd be fine during mass. When I woke up the next day it was already an hour late. I asked my mom why and she said, ""well since you said your throat hurt I thought you wouldn't want to go to mass. You're always the background singer anyway."" After that I just was never given any chances to showcase my singing skills out of fear i'd bail out on them again. Over ten years later and thinking about this still makes me furious. "

374,"''there's always adoption!''

i know it comes from a kind place, really, i do. but the fact that adoption exists is not some kind of huge revelation to an infertile woman/couple, and they should be allowed to process their grief and arrive at adoption as a choice that stands on its own merits.

376,"I think that's another big part of emotional labor. Nobody asked you to do it, you had to take the initiative yourself, meaning that you had to take the time to consider and anticipate what everyone else would want/need without any prompting or input from others. That in itself is emotional labor, even if you could have then delegated the execution to the other members of the household. It's easy to go to the store and pick up some things for your guests, but it takes more to think about those guests and what they'll need while they're staying with you, then take it upon yourself to make sure that you have those things rather than assuming they can fend for themselves. You're taking care of them before they've even arrived, whereas the other people in your household probably haven't given it the slightest thought because you're expected to handle that sort of thing."

So yes, I will second everyone who says it is internalized misogyny. These girls usually want to feel special and different in the eyes of men. Now don't get me wrong, I'm sure there are girls out there who aren't like this and just happen to get along better with guys. The difference with them is, they don't feel the need to say it nor are they fiercely overprotective of their guy friends. "

My mother-in-law had an old unreliable car and was worried about making the 3-hour drive to be at our wedding, so she planned to get a ride with her sister, sister's husband, and their son and his boyfriend. Day of the wedding we find out that *all three* men involved in this carpool hadn't bothered to get the day off work and had ended up working, taking all the cars with them so that my husband's mom and aunt couldn't drive down. To this day I still get angry that they all decided it was cool to just not show up for the five meals we purchased for them and have her miss being in her only child's wedding. It was also somewhat crazy to us that mom and aunt couldn't problem-solve that situation to find *any* way to get there.

I do think our culture teaches women that only a special few can be successful- get the guy, the job, look the best, etc.

Her attitude is like a defense against that culture, I think. I really doubt that my mum's arguments would stand up to a grilling, and i'm willing to bet that she doesn't really believe her own bullshit. She just had to armour herself against the constant criticism and it came out in a weird way.
