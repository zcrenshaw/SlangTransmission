0,Y'all have some shitty ass pockets on your clothes. 
1,"As a guy I had no idea how shitty it can be to go to bars or other social places because of aggressive guys.

I've been hit on by gay guys on two different occasions recently.  

The first one was really drunk and just came up to me at the bar and started pulling on my beard and offered to trim it for me (and all sorts of other things that would get us alone together.  I made it very clear I was both straight and annoyed with him many times but he persisted.  I ducked out of the bar when he went to the bathroom.

The second time I was talking with a friend of mine at the bar and the guy comes up and asks what kind of beer I want to drink.  I held up my whiskey and said I was good, thanks though.  He puts his arm on the back of my chair and asks again what my favorite beer was, I answered with a beer the bar didn't carry so he bought a couple of stouts and then just started eating the chips off my plate.  I tried to ignore him (he was at my back when I was facing my buddy) but when the beers came he started touching my back and dropping the chips in my lap.  By this time I had asked him a few times to get lost in a rather rude manner but again, he persisted.  It took the bartender telling the guy to leave me alone before he did.

No, these weren't gay bars.  Yes the experience did kind of put me in a foul mood each time.  No I didn't feel threatened really, I was taller and stronger than either of these guys.  I mentioned the experience here a while back and one of you ladies responded with 'now imagine they were huge dudes that could've done what they wanted with you physically and that there's a decent chance of this happening every night'.

I had never thought of that before.  Yes, those guys were annoying but chances of an encounter like that for me are almost 0 (I'm not *that* good looking).  Dealing with pushy, annoying, intimidating guys isn't something I worry about when I go out.  But it is for you."
2,oral sex. i'll never get over the expectation that people secretly find vaginas disgusting and only do it out of obligation. i had a very shameful upbringing.
3,His dick is much bigger than mine.
4,"Few takeaways:

- Sexualization, objectification and harassment start at an awfully young age, and continue for ever.

- Eating disorders. More women talk about them than men do (especially online).

- How divided the feminist movement is. A lot of the goals are similar but the differences between places like AskFeminists and GenderCritical are insane.

- Holding conservative opinions as a woman can be rough.

- How pervasive heteronormativity is. It's something to the effect of a *glass shattering* moment: once you see it, you can't unsee it. I'm straight so it doesn't affect me the same way it would affect a non-straight person, but I have gained perspective on how annoying/discouraging/depressing/aggravating it is.

- Many people have no sexual tact online.

- Some people here have really cool jobs; always great to learn about those.

- 99% of the time, the answer to ""Does she like me?"" is ""No"" because men are very eager to interpret basic politeness as sexual interest, thereby making this a very fine line for women to walk.

- Some great insight into Post Partum Depression.

- The statistics about rape kits was eye opening.

- This subreddit seems to be filled with people who are well read and while most people don't read the same kinds of books I do, whenever I feel like reading something outside of my usual preference, I browse the book threads for suggestions.

My only complaint is that people don't post pics of their pets nearly as much as I'd like. Y'all have some really cool pets with some really cool names."
5,"My ex and I had this insane sexual chemistry. With him I loved being really submissive while he dominated me, and it would get intense. 

He used to handcuff me with my wrists under my thighs, propping my legs up. He would keep me in his room for extended periods of time and ignore me for long stretches of it. He'd sporadically fuck me when he felt like it,  would flip me over and use me as a laptop table, make me suck him off while he was working on things, etc. 

He was the sweetest guy in the world, and very doting on me. The contrast with how aggressive he was in the bedroom drove me insane. Even little things like picking me up and throwing me on the dining table to initiate was great. 

I once awkwardly admitted to him I loved roleplay and reading fantasy erotica. He just rolled with this seamlessly. He would ""kidnap"" me and say the filthiest things while pretending I was a princess or something. This went on for three days straight and I could barely walk after. 

I miss him a lot and I sometimes get sad because I don't think I'll ever get fucked that well again. The thought of even asking the current guy mortifies me. "
6,"When you were talking about our strength compared to yours and that most of us could overpower most of you. I never realized that some of you are constantly stressed when walking alone in the dark going home or wherever. 

It kind of hurt to know that we can scare you just being around you. But I do get it and act consequently."
7,Farts getting caught in your vulvas
8,"I don't think I can be swayed by any particular item, but I pay attention to how clean the items in his room are."
9,"If I'm on my period and bleeding through my pants, I'd like for someone to tell me privately "
10,"My IUD. No daily pill, minimal hormonal dosage, good for 5 years, and luckily for me, no periods."
11,[deleted]
12,Good. I like knowing who's a jerk without any effort.
13,I found it interesting how many girls want to see books and a bookshelf when they walk into a guys house. I love woodworking and can build a bookshelf no problem but I prefer using an iPad for reading.
14,Exit through the gift shop.
15,"I love telling this story.

I moved in with a friend in college and we went to IKEA to get furniture and this mofo *needed* a huge, huge bookcase with glass cabinet doors. We bring it home and he starts filling it with all kinds of books - from Harry Potter to Yotsuba to Name of the Wind to Brothers Karamazov. When he put a leatherbound copy of Moby Dick on the shelf I couldn't take it any more. So I asked. ""Dude. Why do you have so many heavy books? Like OK reference books and a couple light novels but I don't see you cracking Dostoyevsky this semester, do you?""

He just looks at me and goes, ""Trust me. You'll see.""

Not a single woman that entered our apartment left without borrowing a book. It got him five dates that I know of, and me one (asked her out when she came by to return one). Sheer genius, and I'd never have thought of it. Wonder if he found this subreddit in 2010.

EDIT: As a Kindle guy, this is the one downside - a book on your Kindle isn't going to catch someone's eye."
16,Vibrator.
17,I'm very independent and need a lot of alone time. I also care for people but am not very emotionally expressive.
18,"A happy and furry pet that I can play with. Cat, dog, rabbit, pig, etc. 

**Edit: That said, please do not get a pet just to impress your preferred gender.**"
19,I'm 31 and only just discovered the wonders of dry shampoo after washing my hair daily for years. 
20,"When I'm reading a lesbian story and it's all going fine - until the sex starts and it's blatantly written by a guy who doesn't understand vaginas and is fixated on penises. Something like ""she felt her cock [dildo] inside of her, and it was *almost as good* as the real thing"". Said no lesbian ever.

Now I have to skip ahead to the sex parts first to make sure I don't waste time with the prelude."
21,*please someone mention a cardboard cutout of himself in the corner of the living room*
22,"Uh, this is actually one of my own, from my old fanfiction days. My guildies used to tease me relentlessly for it, hopefully it fits the spirit of the thread:

*""I want to fuck you,"" Leon hissed in Ashley's ear, and her moan seemed to get caught in her throat, a sweet dolphin of pleasure, trapped in the tuna nets of Leon's seduction.*

Yeah. The tuna nets of seduction... "
23,That you guys really appreciate trash cans in bathrooms with lids
24,"Going to dinner/movies/etc. by yourself. I used to be afraid of people judging me, then decided that spending time with myself doing what I wanted was more important."
25,"That every woman is ridiculously different. (Don't come thrash me. My thought is just confirmed + expanded upon more, now.)

Edit: Wooooo. No thrashing. Thanks, ladies. "
26,Soap in the bathroom. 
27,hey its me ur bucket list
28,"Ive got anxiety/depression.

 I like a tight schedule and try to plan out everything.If you say you're gonna hang with me at 430 and show up at 445, i'll be irritated. 

I get antsy about where I'm at in life every 3 months or so, like clockwork."
29,"I don't think it affects me too much based on what other people think/do, because I don't notice anything. But the way I feel about myself royally sucks. It is a constant cycle of trying to eat better and exercise, followed by not seeing results, followed by ""fuck it I'll eat what I want,"" followed by the shame and guilt of eating absolute shit, and then starting over with trying to eat better. Repeat cycle indefinitely. "
30,"Today's post brought to you by the fic I was reading last night, which was totally fine and acceptable right up until the author dropped the phrase ""boy-pussy"" in reference to an asshole. 😖

And now I never want to read anything again. Ever. "
31,Forearms. Women LOVE forearms.
32,"When Prince Charles married Lady Diana Spencer in the early 1980s, it was seen as necessary for the bride of the heir to the throne to be a virgin.

When Prince William married Kate Middleton a few years ago, that wasn't even a thing - to the extent that people weren't even talking about how that isn't a thing any more."
33,"I won't pay money to get my own money out of the bank. (I make exceptions overseas, but fuck paying ATM fees at home). 

Edit: not American, these lovely suggestions won't help me I'm afraid. "
34,A MMF threesome where the guys are into each other as much as they're into me. 
35,"He gets along well with my dad. *No one* gets along with my dad! Hell, *I* don't even get along with him most of the time! He's a half-senile stubborn old narcissist. So after the guy I was dating not only could tolerate the man (like I do), but became sort of friends with him, I knew he was a keeper! Dad's been totally different since I started bringing said guy around. This guy is such a positive, happy influence on me and my whole family! He brightens the day of everyone around him. I couldn't let him get away. Luckily he thought of that too, 69 days and counting until wedding day :)"
36,"My issue is not with the jokes, but the fact that some people really believe that shit.  So, when they hear it as a joke, then it means that it is alright to believe it.  Same with racist jokes, really.

Period jokes are just funny, but I have never heard a man do one that was good.  Most guys go with the ""she must be on her period"" type thing and that is just bullshit."
37,"God there's so much I want to do:

- I want to have sex in a sex swing
- I want to have sex with a butt plug in
- I want to be bound and gagged
- I want forced orgasms and orgasm denial
- I want to give my future partner a full pleasure treatment (lapdance, bath, massage, blowjob, etc). 
- I want to have sex in a plane
- I want to roleplay and dress up
- I want nipple clamps
- Have my future partner use a remote controlled vibrator on me in public
- Have sex high
- Have sex on shrooms
- I wanna get suspended from the ceiling and fucked.
- Basically everything tbh"
38,"Beers or wine in the shower/bath.  The coldness from the beer and the heat of the shower makes it so refreshing, and you can taste it better.  It's a glorious way to unwind, and I just started doing it about 3 years ago.

Oh, and grocery delivery like Prime Pantry or HEB.com.  I'm such a lazy fuck, I love getting my essentials delivered to me, then just go pick up fresh produce once a week.  Holla!"
39,"Ctrl+F ""Katana"" ... ""0 results""? Whaaaat?"
40,"I'm not sure interesting is the right word, but one of the most eye-opening experiences was reading a thread about cat calls and learning how young some girls are when they have to start dealing with them. Even though I know intellectually that not all guys do that shit, it made me feel real shame on behalf of my gender. "
41,"Anything decorative, like artworks or small sculptures or plants. I like to think they say a bit about the person. Many guys live purely 'for function' and don't own anything like that so it's interesting to me when they do."
42,"When we argue, no matter how heated it gets, he is always willing to talk through things. I've been in a relationship where the guy left because of literally one stupid argument. Never heard from him ever again. My boyfriend now though-is willing to talk through it, apologize when necessary and has the mentality of us vs. the problem, as opposed to you vs. me. "
43,"I think the single most important fact I've learnt is that it's not as scary to talk to women as I thought years ago. For context, I was very often teased when interacting with girls when I was younger, and ended up more or less avoiding them all the way into my 20s. When I made my first post on AW about 4-5 years ago, I got anxious to the point of shaking and being unable to sleep that night, lol.
Thankfully, a lot of that anxiety has dissipated thanks to being able to practice here.

Other than that, I've learnt a lot more about sexism and the things a lot of women deal with in that regard and have become more aware of it.

Diversity in tastes and opinions is another thing. I'm not *as* insecure about certain things about my body as I used to be, because I'm fairly sure there are women who would like me the way I am. *Maybe*. :P

I'm sure I've learnt a lot more, but those were the immediate things that I could think of."
44,"In my 30's ... starting to say ""no"" more and it feels FANTASTIC."
45,"I was in Girl Guides Canada for years, and selling cookies in the snow, rain, or occasionally hail was super successful but also miserable. People buy lots more cookies than usual because they feel sorry for the frozen girls, but that involves freezing in the first place. 

Although one time a woman asked 14 year old me how many children I had, and I had to explain that I was in the 9th grade. That was interesting. "
46,I feel you. My SO eats me out sometimes (I go down on him every single time) but I stop him after a few minutes because I feel so uncomfortable and can't believe that he is getting any enjoyment out of it.
47," Books, lots of 'em. It means we have something in common and something to talk about."
48,"To repeat what some have said, oral sex is my biggest one.  

I love it and I crave it, but I cannot get over the belief that men don't like it or actually putting their mouths or whatever on my vagina.  I assume the appearance or scent or taste is disgusting to all of them and they're just hiding it.   Additionally, I think that it'll take me too long to orgasm and he'll get bored or tired and just won't want to continue sex.  

I also have a problem demanding ""Extras"" like being more assertive about being fingered or having my breasts or waist touched or my neck bit or other parts of my body kissed.  I'm shy and awkward about it."
49,You understand our struggles
50,"Just how much is expected of women by $generic_guy. In particular something I read led me to that emotional labor thread on Metafilter and I spent the first third of it going ""this can't be real, no one could possibly expect his wife to manage his social calendar with his family, that would be insane"". Among other things, it clarified a few times where I asked a woman to do me a favor (say, hang up a shirt in my closet for me) and it became a huge thing - it made them think I expected it forever and not just because my hands were full."
51,The world has too many people already. 
52,His butt.
53,"That the tab at the computer keyboard that allows you to jump to the next field in a form (most people know this), can also used backwards if you hit the shift key first. Look at the tab key, it even *says* it!!

Amost never need the mouse anymore."
54,"Since Trump was elected president, everyone is suddenly talking about the forgotten white working class. While it is true that blue collar workers in rural America have been left behind as industry move overseas, I would like to see us all address the fact that working class folks of color have been ignored since the beginning of time. That's my big elephant in the room rn."
55,"I've stopped seeing a guy over not having soap in the bathroom. He also​ had no toilet paper. Seriously, guys?"
56,He has amazing eyelashes.
57,"When I started my job in an office of all men, some of my coworkers asked me if I got offended by jokes about women. I said, ""No, but I do get offended by bad jokes."" I think there can be funny jokes that play on gender, but the two types you mention tend to be lazy and unfunny. I think you can joke about anything. But if you want to make a joke, it better be funny."
58,"I edit erotica for freelance. Within 175 words, the author in the latest book used the phrase, ""a ball of ecstasy in my gut"" five different times. She also uses ""erupted"" for ""orgasming.""

Another good one was, ""My eyes widened at the massive piece of man-flesh between his legs.""

Last book, ""I inhaled her smoky pussy."" Still unsure about that.

OH! And, recently, ""all I could imagine was how good it'd feel to be impaled over and over again with his meaty stick."""
59,"Yes, please clean your toilet and make sure your mirror isn't covered in loads of Toothpaste spit.

60,"My ex dumped me on Xmas eve, by informing me that I wasn't coming to his family's Xmas dinner as he was bringing his new girlfriend. Now granted he and I had been on and off for a couple of months, but still that stung! The last year of our relationship had not been a great one. He was entering into full blown functioning alcoholic territory, and I was emotionally neglected due to his drinking. 

After we broke-up, I took a bunch of money I'd been saving for our potential wedding a booked an 7 week trip to Africa. I changed my grad school plans and on a whim applied to an Ivy league - I was accepted. I packed up and moved to NYC after travelling Africa. My masters lead me to my dream job, which more than doubled my previous salary. I travelled a bunch more, my ex wasn't big on travel. I made some kick ass new friends. I began dating again.

Now, 6 years after that awful Xmas eve. I'm married to an amazing man who is better than my husband in everyway: kinder, more thoughtful, better looking, funnier,  better in bed, smarter, more loyal. For instance, I had a rough day at work yesterday. I mentioned it to my husband and he walked in the door with: a bottle of my favourite wine, a bag of miss vickie's chips, rainbow twizzlers, and my favourite rootbeer. He said I didnt know what you'd want most so I bought everything. 

Together we own a beautiful home, and an awesome dog. Life couldn't be better."
61,"The fucking ""women don't know where they want to eat"" thing pisses me off to no end. Sometimes people are indecisive, but I've literally never encountered this as a gendered thing. It's just such a stupid stereotype."
62,"I want someone to make love to me. I crave emotional intimacy. 

I didn't realize how important that was to me until I burst into tears the same time as I climaxed while watching a Peaky Blinders sex scene. "

*""No"" to planning a traditional wedding (sooooo many ""no's"" in the wedding category)

**NO** without anything behind it. No more ""I really wish I could, but"" or ""no because X justification"" .... Just, 'no.' I don't need to apologize or rationalize my decisions to everyone all the time."

76,"You shouldn't consider oral, fingering or touching extras. That should be part of the standard package"
77,"This was probably the highlight of my day...

For the past 3 months I've noticed a rather larger bump on my bikini area. I knew it was either an ingrown or a pimple so I kept picking at it hoping it would come to a head. It got bigger and slightly discolored (bruised from all the picking). 

I slept panty-less and applied a mixture of BHA/AHA every night on the area for almost 1 month hoping the bump would go away. For almost 1.5 months, I did not see a difference until today. I was using the washroom at work, looked down, and saw a tiny curly hair poking out. I yanked it out and saw the long ingrown that had been hiding inside my body. GOT YA, YA FUCKER. "
78,"I hate when I'm reading and I get ""she walked delicately with her long blonde long hair swaying across her slim shoulders. Her flowing silk see through dress wrapped beautifully around her toned pale but not too pale body with perfect 36DD breasts. Swaying her plump rear excitedly. Her deep sea colored eyes lit up the sky"" Then when it gets to the guy part I get a ""Muscled square walked toward her with his big penis"""

83,"First time I did nothing. We argued, he begged forgiveness, we cried, I forgave.

Second time I left and went to a friend's place overnight.  He rocked up there and damaged their door because I wouldn't come out and talk to him.  I left with him so he wouldn't damage more of their property. Again, forgave him after an icy few days. 

Third time I ended up at the hospital.  They thought my cheek was fractured, and he'd hit me so hard I literally lost my voice too. Drove myself.  Was put in a hostel for a few days and never went back.  Stayed at a different friend's place for a few days until returning to my own place.  (I was paying rent on another place while living with him- but all of my furniture was at his house). 

He then started sending death threats, and told me that he'd be at my work an x time and x date-and was going to kill me. 

He arrived at time and date, but the police were waiting. He went to prison. 

Edit: word and typo"
84,"Not exactly sexist? but when I was in high school (early 90s, small town Minnesota), being gay would have been tantamount to a crime. In 20-25 years, things have changed a LOT."
85,"I wasn't a  bridesmaid, but I was best woman (my SO was the ""man of honor"".  SO while our roles were reversed from the norm it was because my SO was really good friends with the bride and I was really good friends with the groom and while the 4 of us were great friends the couple thought it would be great if the people that introduced them were on the ""correct"" sides of the aisle for the ceremony).  

One of the other groomsmen was adamant about hiring a stripper.  Now I don't care about that stuff and wouldn't have an issue sitting through the show with them, but the groom was adamant about no strippers.  The groomsman got belligerent and hired one anyway.  I found out (from the other groomsman) and met her at the door, paid her, and sent her on her way before she was seen by the groom.  For the rest of the night the belligerent groomsman thought it was because I was a bitch trying to ruin the fun of the night.  I totally let him think that and didn't tell the groom a damned thing. TO this day I don't think he knows that his brother tried to hire a stripper for the festivities that night.  It's not that the groom was a prude it was just one of those things he was very adamant about not wanting because he thought it was incredibly disrespectful to himself and to his soon to be wife as well as the wives of the other guys there.  He wouldn't have enjoyed it and would have felt extraordinarily guilty about it happening on a night that was supposed to be about him.   To this day I think his brother still hates me but I don't think the groom knows why and I don't care enough to tell him what really happened because it was a fantastic night otherwise."
86,"Anything that involves him doing something extra for me. There are some things I'd like to do and we've talked about it and he'd be just as into it as I would, but I I'm asking him to do something for me and I feel like I'm being selfish. Stuff like getting tied up. Part of the reason I enjoy that sort of thing is because I don't have to worry about what I'm doing next (although I like to be on both sides of that!). 

Of course, there are some times when I do things just for him and don't want anything in return. I know I'm being silly about it, and I feel 100% open with him, but I have a hard time articulating it.

Edit: thanks to this thread, I realize I should probably just suck it up and talk to him about it. Thanks y'all :)"

This. Being friendly doesn't contain a hidden agenda of sexual desire. I don't know how many times I've tried to explain to a guy that just because a girl they find attractive talks to them, it doesn't mean she wants him. I think it's male ego honestly. They believe what they want to believe and a lot of them are really far up their own ass. 
"
90,"Part of it is also just projection. They can't imagine talking to a woman/being nice for a reason other than being sexually interested, and assume the same is true for her."

98,"The first time I was catcalled, I was 11. I had no fucking idea how to deal with it or even what it was. All I knew was that it made me uncomfortable. But I was taught to respect my elders, so having 30 or 40 year old men trying to get my attention, I felt obligated to be polite. 

I finally learned around 14 that it was ok to ignore them or tell them to fuck off. That was also the point where I learned that some men don't take that well."
99,"my 4 year old says ""My toots just tickled my peep!  I love that!""  OMG"
100,Sometimes being on your own is just rewarding in itself. :)
101,"I think it's worth noting that (this is a super common phenomenon -- I'm not calling or singling you out, just using this specific story as an example of a larger pattern) it took you being intrusively hassled by two guys to *really* believe something most women either do experience or have experienced before."
102,"It depends who it is. 

My husband? I know he is doing it ironically and he doesn't actually think that and normally the context is quite humorous and in good spirits with a bit of back and forth banter. 

A stranger? I would probably also assume they are saying it ironically. 

I live in England and most of the things people say are sarcastic and ironic so it always catches me off guard when people are genuinely sexist. However you do get the odd wazzock who is, so I just ignore them and move on. Maybe throw them a bit of pity but I usually don't waste my time. "
103,"When I joined the military in the 1990's, women had to wear skirts. Now they have gender neutral uniforms. 

Not childhood stuff, but still a big change."
104,"They think it's a ""woman thing"" because *they've never dated a man before.* God. Also do they not have male friends? Because ALL of my male friends in this one circle are TERRIBLE about this. There's four of them and they will go *hours* without deciding on something to eat because ""I don't know"" and ""I don't care"" over and over and over."

108,"I'm bisexual. I was married to a man and since then I've been exclusively with women. I've been climbing [the Kinsey scale](http://i.imgur.com/AsyEBwN.png) my whole life. I figure I'm a 5 now.

I'm happy to discuss my tastes in both porn and erotica.

I find almost all porn a turn-off. I go all Sahara-panties if I suspect that anyone is acting or pretending. I find unrealistically long nails and huge fake breasts depressing, not arousing.

That said, there is some porn I enjoy very much and very frequently.

I like **Hysterical Literature.** Do you know that series? It's ultra-sexy but so ""clean"" the videos are on YouTube. The idea is that a woman brings in a book and reads a chapter aloud. Below the table, out of our sight, someone is stimulating her with a strong vibrator. We watch as her reading starts strong and confident, and then she begins to falter, and then breaks off as orgasm takes her. It is so, so sexy, yet not explicit at all. [Hysterical Literature](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVna2B64pQwolR2Y09aqHuIEwWh0RVuLq)

There's a Dutch company that makes videos called **I Feel Myself.** Ordinary women - not porn stars or models - come into a room and find themselves alone with a bed and a collection of cameras that are running automatically. They climb onto the bed, remove as much or as little clothing as they like, and masturbate to orgasm. The cameras record everything but the women are alone and comfortable. They get all kinds of women - shave-headed dykes, great big tattooed BBWs, housewives, college professors, and beautiful young girls of every flavor. I like watching the women's faces, the way their fists clench as they cum, the sounds they make. [I Feel Myself on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/ifeelmyself)

I Feel Myself has a sister site called **Beautiful Agony.** It's much the same, except that it shows only the faces of the women (and men) who are having orgasms - not their bodies. I often start there but I find myself impatient for more and switch back to I Feel Myself. Your mileage may vary. [Beautiful Agony](https://www.pornhub.com/playlist/2776941)

Speaking of listening, Reddit's **gonewildaudio** group is the sexiest part of Reddit by a mile, in my estimation. Group members post audio recordings of themselves telling naughty stories or masturbating. Dirty talk, gasping, moaning...oh my! If you have been there, you know what I'm talking about. If you haven't, go check it out. I'll wait here while you're...um, busy. [gonewildaudio](https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildaudio)

I have come to appreciate the porn produced by an organization called **Frivolous Dress Order.** These are quite curious videos. Women are instructed to wear revealing outfits and then to go out into public. They are filmed at a distance as they sit on a park bench or in a cafe with their breasts partially exposed. These videos are sexy not for what you see on the screen, but for the way you imagine what it must feel like to be that woman, to sit there like that. I don't have much of an exhibitionist streak, but when I show these vids to exhibitionist partners they find themselves very aroused. [A few samples.](http://moresisek.com/video/frivolous+dress+order)

I also collect videos of women - not models or actresses - who are filmed having their first experiences with a **Sybian.** The looks on their faces are extraordinary as they are overcome by the sensations. [cdgirls](http://www.xvideos.com/video8178282/may_on_sybian_-_part_1)

When it comes to erotic writing, I'm afraid my background in professional and academic writing is a handicap. Most erotica is so poorly written that I can't get aroused.

One exception is Nicholson Baker's delightful short novel *Vox,* which is presented as the transcript of two strangers getting to know each other on a pay-by-the-minute sexy chat line. (Do they even have those anymore?)

I also enjoyed [the erotica Anne Rice wrote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sleeping_Beauty_Quartet) under the pseudonym A.N. Roquelaure.

My very favorite literary erotica must be the stories I have written myself. I am a journalist by day but I write naughty stories for my friends to enjoy privately. I have a hard drive full of them.

"
109,"The whole ""women hate each other"" BS. I've known guys who were backstabbing gossipy jerks to their friends, this isn't something unique to the female gender."
110,That's my main date criteria. No cardboard cutout of yourself in the living room? Don't even bother.
111,"I've heard the phrase ""shit pussy"" before. 

Who on earth finds that sexy?"
112,"I'm a lifetime member of Girl Scouts. 

Selling cookies was easy. Demand outstrips supply, because you have to find a girl/troop to buy them from directly (as opposed to buying them online or in a store). Relatives, neighbors, and parents' coworkers start asking about it before the sale even officially begins. We usually had a tally going by the time we received the paperwork. "
113,"There's sex, and then there's GOOD sex. It took me until age 31 to discover the latter. My entire life changed. "
114,"Dude! You are right! Just yesterday I slapped on a new pair of fancy black pants (from Costco, where the fanciest of all the clothes live), went to stick a hair tie in my pocket, only to have my fingers bend painfully backwards in shock as they were met with a solid, invincible seam of thick thread. WHY?! Why do you pretend to put big nice pockets on jean-like pants that SHOULD have pockets! We like pockets! We NEED pockets! Give us pockets!"
115,"A dude just told me he never realized how horrible it is that women are judged primarily for their looks, more than anything else we could ever do/be."
116,"I think that's why I can't really read erotica with women in it - I get too distracted by the total implausibility of it all. Every body part pulses or thrums or ""opens"" at some point and I'm left like... wha? At least with men I can trick myself into thinking like ""oh yeah well...maybe they do feel like electricity is flowing through them every 5 seconds."" "
117,"I feel like women are shamed a hell of a lot more for using birth control and abortions. It was just a thing that happened when I was younger, now its a hot button issue.....despite the fact that birth rates have decreased."
118,When I'm already cuddled up on the couch watching something or reading on my phone and my boyfriend dumps his warm laundry right out of the dryer on top of me while he folds. He usually puts some over my head so he can pretend to look for me and give me a kiss before he starts 
119,"I'm the oldest child in my family. Yet, by the time they were 11, both of my younger brothers could easily overpower me. I remember one time, when I was ""babysitting"" because my parents were out, my youngest brother got upset because I beat him at a video game. He threw a tantrum and started hitting me. I could barely defend myself and was scared of a ten year old boy, because physically he was already almost a match for me. It took my other brother - who was fifteen at the time - to step in and help me. 

At that point it sunk in that if I could only just hold my own against a ten year old, what chance would I ever have against an adult man? 

Men like to joke about how women are not as strong as them, how they'll always beat women in sports or physical feats but I don't think they realise how scary that is. "
120,Toys. When I was a kid there was only one section and you would choose whatever you wanted. Nowadays there are very defined isles for boys and girls. Even brands like Lego make different types for girls. I feel like we're going backwards in that issue. 
121,"About when I turned 37 I started to get terrified of aging, and kind of wished i didn't have to live more than a few more years. I recently turned 38 and a week later got diagnosed with a rare type of cancer, which is aggressive and doesn't respond to chemo or radiation if it's spread. Due to where it is, the doctors said it's *unlikely* to have spread, and surgery to remove it will probably mean I'm fine. But I've got a somewhat real chance now of that ""I don't want to live much longer"" coming true. Doesn't feel like such a great wish now. Especially not to my husband, who wasn't happy i felt that was before but at least it wasn't ""real"" yet."

124,"I wish we could talk about and people would realize there is a right TO as well as a right NOT TO. There's plenty of examples of this, but one I experience personally is being asexual and not being terribly interested in sex/nudity and being called prudish by those who are strong believers of sexual liberation. I will never limit another woman's right to her own body and sexual decisions,  but I wish people could just do whatever and have it not be a label or somehow indicative of what kind of person one is. There was a thread recently about confidence in bikinis and while I get that it's hard to feel comfortable being seen in so little clothing, I'm a very confident person and I hate being told I'm not reaching my fullest potential because I don't like wearing bikinis (or really any swimwear)."
125,"My friend recently posted one on Facebook from a trashy romance she was reading that detailed how the woman's clit felt ""deep and wide open"", or something like that. Definitely some form of ""open"". It was written by a woman, too...  "
126,You missed the three shells?
127,"Just because a woman accepts certain behaviors doesn't make the behaviors non-misogynistic. Many women have been raised in a misogynist culture. 

Also, indirectly related, this quote from u/destria on the ""As a woman, whats an unpopular opinion you have on women or womens issues?"" thread:

""I think this is unpopular among certain groups of feminists but I take issue with the idea that sexualising yourself is empowerment. I'm really talking about third wave feminists who advocate being 'girly', wearing make up and revealing clothes, posing in objectifying ways, entering beauty pageants etc. as empowering. For an individual, maybe it can be empowering. But I just don't think we live in a society where those kind of images and messages are truly empowering. Unfortunately I think things like the beauty industry, fashion and make up industries, are still predominantly serving the male gaze. And I think we grow up in a culture where I guess I question whether these are 'free' and empowering choices... in the world we live in? I can't separate it from the overt value people place on women's appearances."""
128,"I wake up 5 days a week before 5 to go to the gym.  I try to eat healthy for 80% of my meals throughout the week.  I am losing weight.

But I am caught up in what perfect strangers think about me because I have seen the hateful talk that the internet spews.  I am sure people are thinking about how I need to go to the gym because PEOPLE HAVE SHOUTED THAT TO ME ON THE STREET.  It gets so wrapped up in my mind that I know it isn't healthy mentally.

I try to make myself as small as possible on the bus every morning so as to not inconvenience whoever has to sit next to me.  I pull my shoulders in and sit uncomfortably.  

I wish I had never gotten to this weight but death and mourning rages hell on your mental state and suddenly I was much heavier than I was.  Losing weight is a much slower process than putting it on."
129,Yet there are people who want to give women a ton of shit for choosing not to reproduce. It's absolutely insane 
130,"The fact that women always have to have some level of awareness of personal safety when out in social situations, even down to considering what they are wearing in a given environment. 

As a guy, I rarely if ever give two fucks about what I'm wearing, if I'm being 'provocative', or whether of not I will be attacked.

The fact that women DO have to think about the above issues to any degree at all makes me sad and angry."
131,"I think it's sad and confusing that so many women, myself included, didn't even realize how much work is involved until it was pointed out to us. It happens so easily and silently. I've even done it with male friends as well as within romantic relationships. I see almost all of my female family and friends performing this work. 

I believe that I have a good awareness of issues surrounding feminism and misogyny, but the concept of emotional labor floored me. It reminds me of just how much I still have to learn or at least wake up to."
132,"Probably the little ways my anxiety manifests.  Like I literally can't sleep until I know you're home safe.  Just shoot me a text to let me know all is well and you aren't dead on the road somewhere.  

This sorta thing has been interpreted as me trying to be all up in your business or trying to control what you're doing, but it's really not like that."
133,"It's not good humour though, it's an unfunny joke that pokes fun at women and stereotypes them. 
EDIT: If I felt it was crossing a line I would say so, I can take a joke and have banter, but if I'm having a bad day and a guy comes out with ""woah! Someone's on their period!"" That's gonna push a button. "
134,"Every break up I've had has led me to be happier afterwards, even if didn't want it to end at the time. 

"
135,"The whole women are venters men are solvers thing.  In my experience, everyone wants to vent when they're pissed about something and nobody wants the person they're venting to to attempt to solve their problem.  This is probably because 10 minutes of venting is virtually never going to provide enough information for that other person to be able to come up with solutions that haven't been thought of/tried already.  Nobody likes getting treated like they're an idiot who can't think of the most obvious of solutions.  

So really the difference for me has always been some people are listeners, and others don't want to listen so they interrupt with solutions instead (probably knowing full well that their solutions are useless).  I get that, I'm also uncomfortable around upset people and have historically done whatever possible to make that conversation end as quickly as possible, including offering solutions or trying to change the subject.  But being uncomfortable with emotions is not the same thing as being ""solution oriented"" and using that as a justification is just a cop out.  "
136,"Totally. I got a vibrating plastic dildo (you know, the cheapy one from the sex shop) and I used it a few times just as a dildo. It never really did anything for me with or without the vibrations. I mentioned to a friend that I had one and didn't really get anything out of it. Her response was that she didn't get anything out of hers either until she stopped using it as a dildo and just applied the vibrations to her clit. Holy cow you guys. Mind blown. I told her several years later that her offhand comment made me rethink how I was using my vibrator and eventually made me figure out how to orgasm! "
137,[deleted]
138,"That we all want relationships. For some reason my male friends keep thinking their FWB girl friends are going to settle down with them. Pro-tip, they aren't they're also my friends and trust me they just want dick from you. "
139,"This is a sad thing that's all too common. It's like when you see those articles where a guy pretends to be a woman online and is like, ""Wow, I was constantly harrassed and threatened and wasn't taken seriously. Who would've guessed??"" And it's like, dude, that is so not a surprise for any woman out there. 

I don't wanna shit on OP of this chain, but why is it that it takes a man experiencing it for it to really hit home for some men? Why can't they just believe a huge proportion of women when they say they experience this kind of shit?"
140,My clitoris.
141,"I don't have anything to list but http://mojoupgrade.com/ is an interesting site for those wanting to see what their partner is into without the candid conversation. Though I'm a fan of the candid conversation followed by openmindedness. When I was a kid I was allowed to avoid whatever food I didn't like as long as I tried it once, and I think that's a good rule of thumb (with some hard limits which aren't negotiable)."
142,"The first time I got into my boyfriend's place, I saw he had a copy of *Ulysses* on his bookcase. I asked him if he had read it, because I was intrigued, and he told me ""You know, I *try* to read it every few months or so, but I guess I'm not smart enough, because I wind up having no clue what I'm reading and just put it down.""

For some reason, I found that a better answer than ""Yeah, I totally loved it!"""
143,I'm now allowed to do all the things my twin brother can do. That wasn't the case when I was a kid. 
144,......really though? Why else do blankets exist?
145,"Refusing to engage with people who make me feel bad about myself or simply say things only to get a raise out of me and have pointless arguments with.

The moment I realised I don't have to acknowledge these people or give in to their madness, my life became so much more enjoyable. "
146,"I am with you 100%. It doesn't help that my first boyfriend told me ""guys think vaginas are gross"" before taking it back a couple years later... Too late for that. "
147,"I would love to be able to join the Mile High Club with my guy, but it also sounds pretty risky, so who knows. "
148,"I don't have to be around anyone who I don't want to be around (outside of work, of course). I don't have to keep friendships with people I don't like. I don't need to return messages from people I don't like. I can choose who I want to surround myself with and I am so much better for it.

When I was younger I had a harder time cutting of friendships with people who were bad for me. Not anymore. "
149,That I really need to stop trying to fix problems right off the bat and start asking if someone needs to vent or actually wants help. 
150,"You'll be well fed, always entertained, and well-sexed."
151,Literally never claim to be a nice guy
152,"Seriously just learned this from a thread today: the reason y'all want blankets on the couch is because you get cold.

I always thought you just liked the texture (""it's so soft"") or having something to cuddle. It literally did not occur to me that you might be cold sitting on the couch."
153,"It's terrifying. I always have been into kinky stuff and I really wanted to play out a rape fantasy. Didn't turn me off of it when I finally did it, but I realized how easy it is for a girl to be overpowered and raped. And I was sore for 2 days. Like fuck, a rape victim would have to be reminded of that for weeks from the body pains. And I couldn't move at all when he had me pinned down. I was done for. "
154,When I go out to dinner by myself I usually try to sit at the bar.  I've had some of my best conversations with random strangers
155,"Oof I am messy/untidy as fuck. I try not to be, especially in the shared common areas of my home, but my bedroom is an absolute disaster. 

I do a deep clean of it every 4 months or so, but I am not good at just keeping it clean. I have a high tolerance for clutter and will straight tunnel vision the clutter out. "
156,"&gt;happy and furry pet

I have stuffed animals with smiles."
157,Cable TV. It just doesn't serve much of a purpose anymore. 
158,"Honestly, even if it's something I would use, I don't want to buy it because I know the women involved are getting scammed big time. I don't want to encourage such an ass backwards business model that preys on women. On paper these ""businesses"" look good, but the amount of hours and *their own money* that the women put in is not even remotely worth what they get paid (often times they're just paid in product, and you can't pay your mortgage with makeup). 

But the culture surrounding MLM products is so encouraging and inspirational that it's almost cult-like, and women yearning for financial independence and work/life flexibility eat it up. I have a friend that just started selling Lularoe not even a month ago, and her husband just quit his job to help her... I understand that Lularoe is popular right now, but the market is so inundated with sellers I can't imagine that it's a viable living if that's your sole income for a family. It just makes me sad."
159,"Everything is scheduled, even the existential crises. "
160,"Same here! Ugh! He thinks his butt looks bad, and I'm like... I would do anything to trade my saggy cellulitey butt for your perky, plump masterpiece"
161,The implant changed my life. I cannot fully describe to you how much happier I am without all my period symptoms. Some nights I would lay there wondering if I should just get a hysterectomy.
162,"""Muscled square walked toward her with his big penis"" should be a mandatory description for every male in erotica, ever, from now forward. "
163,"People are ""concerned"" a lot of the time -- I've had bosses talk to me about it, for example. This doesn't help. I'm working on it, at my pace, and if anything these conversations set me back.

But mostly I'm just invisible. Men and even other women don't notice I'm there. I've been hit on by strangers only a couple times in my adult life. I laugh at the ""woman card"" bullshit I see around. They conveniently forget, like everyone else, that fat or otherwise not-conventionally-attractive women exist."
164,"How much everyone complained. I mean... A day-long event and you only provided 1 meal?? Yeah, the compliments about how wonderful it was weren't *untrue,* but... people don't really go to the bride with complaints. We were hungry. And hot. "
165,All of them. He's stupidly good looking. 
166,"The stereotype that women are the needy,  clingy ones in the relationship has never made sense to me.  Almost every man I've dated has been needier and more clingy than me,  and it's  is the same for all of my woman friends that I've talked to about this.  "
167,"I'm really, really depressed. I don't get out of bed most days and am very seriously planning my suicide. I don't believe that no one has noticed... it'd be impossible not to at this point, but no one has asked whats going on, where ive been, nothing. I used to have a lot of friends who I saw frequently, and I have two parents and three siblings. I dont know why no one has asked. Im trying to get help on my own and I dont expect anyone else to solve my problems for me but... I just always thought that if things got this bad, SOMEONE would say something. It's very sobering to realize that you can virtually disappear and the world doesnt blink an eye."
168,Characters wearing heels as part of a normal outfit at home. Sitcoms are especially bad about this. 
169,Leggings! I knew about them but for some reason I never wore them. Randomly bought a few pairs last year because they were on sale at Target and now I don't think I can ever go back to jeans.
170,"I won't pay for basic cooking herbs. I bought some basil, rosemary, thyme, mint, dill and parsley plants and use them for cooking. I refuse to pay $4 for a handful of fresh basil when I can pay that much for an entire plant and take away cuttings whenever I need them. 

I also tend to grow way more than I need, so I freeze or dry them, or give them away. Grocery store herbs are such a ripoff. "
171,"I do love all cheeses, but brie never disappoints."
172,"I've read fics where the vagina is her ""womanly flower"" and the clit is ""the pearl of her pleasure"". Also, ""globes of his/her/their ass"" just makes me think of those actual spinny globes attached to someone's backside.
"
173,"Borkers, puppers, dogs haha"
174,"I've never ever noticed when a woman was on her period.

But men always say ""she must be having her period"" as if they can tell when it's happening"
175,I feel this so hard. No amount of showering and shaving will make me feel comfortable with it. I'm always terrified that it smells/tastes disgusting.
176,"I think the biggest consistent thing I've noticed having dated a bunch of guys from places other than my own country, is that it's hard to tell right away how much of a guy's quirks is just something you don't get because of a cultural divide, and how much is just him being weird."
177,His skin. He gets so much less acne. 
178,"I pretty much become mute when I'm sad. I don't mean that I drag my feet when it comes to talking about things, I actually cannot carry on a conversation. "
179,"When I told him that I cut off contact with my parents years before, due to a history of abuse: sexual, physical, emotional, etc. He was very compassionate, understanding, and supportive about it. 

Previous SOs were not that understanding or supportive. "
180,Because front pockets will accept an inch of phone if we're lucky.
181,My stomach is doing horrible things so I can't trust a fart. 
182,"I'd go even further and say we need to tackle the thinly-veiled bigotry in the ""white working class"" community that lead to them voting for a guy like Trump. Some people are portraying these people as voting for him for purely economic reasons...like hearing about the Muslim ban and building a wall to prevent Mexicans from coming into this country didn't sweeten the deal for them. Or that the thought of voting for a woman, no matter how qualified - scared them off. 

Really tired of talking about coal mines and factories like there isn't a huge xenophobia problem in that community. "
183,"Also, if you strip away the purple prose, it's pretty much two idiots howling at and gnawing on each other while one of them whaps the other with his dick. 

*sooo hot omg omg omggg*"
184,"I think his eyes are prettier. The color is like mine but lighter and warmer and he's got amazing, long eyelashes."
185,"Average and below-average men always somehow ending up with insanely attractive women. The most recent example I can think of would be *Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them*, where Queenie is inexplicably attracted to one of the least interesting/attractive characters in the movie.  

I don't have a problem with this in real life at all, but in media, I feel like it legitimizes the toxic, entitled attitude some men have about the kind of women they ""deserve""."
186,"it's like Tywin says in Game of Thrones: ""Any man who must say, ""I am the king' is no true king."" If you have to tell someone you're nice, you're probably not nice. "
187,"Pretty and handsome people get so many more advantages. No one talks about it because I guess it feels silly to talk about ""looks privilege"" (or whatever it would be called). But people who are considered attractive according to (usually white Western Euro-centric) beauty standards are treated *so* much better in so many facets of life. "
188,We're lucky to have pockets at all. 
189,"Strong, independent female character who doesn't need a man til a man randomly enters her life and she puts her entire career on hold to pop out his kids."
190,"That, and a lack of self-awareness. If you're the one asking all the time, you *also* don't know where you want to eat.

Everyone is indecisive sometimes!"
191,"Okay, so my aunt and I got into a conversation a few weeks ago that I still can't wrap my brain around.  A friend of hers was going on a family vacation - husband, wife, three kids.  They got to the airport, and the husband was denied boarding because his passport was expired.  I guess the wife said something along the lines of ""Sucks for you, we'll see you in a week"" because, well, her passport was still valid and she wasn't going to miss her vacation because he didn't have his shit together.  I felt like, yeah - his passport is his responsibility.  I would have reminded my SO to check, and maybe I wouldn't have gone ahead without him, but I also wouldn't make three kids miss a vacation they were looking forward to because Dad forgot to check the date on his travel documents.  My aunt was horrified - why on earth should it be the husband's responsibility to check his passport?  She felt that was a wife's responsibility, and she couldn't believe the wife would go on ahead after forgetting to check her husband's passport dates.

Anyway, I think it just highlights how ingrained some of these things can be.  I'm very careful to maintain those boundaries with my SO so that I don't end up taking on these responsibilities for him.  Why can we not just be adults and manage our own shit?"
192,That makes it sound like you don't think he can keep a secret
193,"Ouch! That sounds distinctively unpleasant. 

Maybe it was about a hyena? "

This is my issue with sexist jokes in general. The men at my work often joke about women and after laughing they do the whole ""it's funny because it's true!"" thing (my sister does, too, which is so sad). One of the guys often talk about his wife, and he'll say shit like ""what's the deal with women? &lt;insert thing she did&gt;..."" (all while being completely serious, mind), so even though I enjoy sexist humour, the fun factor goes to -100 when he tells them.

208,"For people requesting info.

I'm on mobile, please don't hate me for how I write this.

Okay, I only fly AA so I can only confirm how the flight attendants operate on their flights. To start with, we buy seats near the very back and always on an isle. The first time we succeeded at this was in December right after Christmas. During our ski trip I hurt my shoulder really bad (Type 5 AC Separation). I was in a sling and very immobile. We always get to board the plane with first class or priority. When we very first got on and it was just me and my gf and a flight attendant I personally asked the attendant if it was okay that she go with me because I would not be able to button or pull up my pants. She had absolutely no problem with it. We still wanted to be discreet and we were. When we landed the flight attendant came by and told us that we are more than welcome to use the restroom now if we need privacy. Little did she know we already used it, we used it well.

Now, we've developed a bit of a strategy. Combining the above info with the fact that every flight I've ever been on with AA is the second we reach cruising altitude the flight attendants go to work like worker bees. So you just need to be observant. They start at the very front of the plane and every single attendant is important to getting food and drinks out. So the second the big roll trays come out and they go to the front of the plane, you're pretty much golden as long as you don't take too long. If you're really worried about it go buy a sling and talk to a flight attendant. Just be sincere and serious. What are they going to say, no?

With all this being said, these bathrooms are normally TINY! We were fortunate and got a decent sized one on our first try. If you're a bigger couple you're likely to bang around on a lot of stuff and someone may complain. My gf is tall but skinny, as am I. So she just sat bare assed on the sink and I went at it like a rabbit for a few minutes. It was awesome, we still talk about it all the time. If you have any other questions or if I missed anything please let me know. If any of you use my suggestions and are successful, please let me know!

213,"I was overweight/obese for my entire life, until about 2 years ago, so I think I'm qualified to comment. Some things that come to mind:

Overweight women are socially invisible. People don't make eye contact, say hello, smile at you, or even really remember you. I don't remember people being cruel, just being ignored a lot.

Overweight women are perceived as being... how should I put this... less useful? I guess it's most noticeable in the career world.

On the flip side, overweight women aren't really considered sexually desirable in society. So in the rare times when you're interacting with a man, you don't need to worry about being hit on.

Walking was much more difficult. I couldn't go half a mile without getting exhausted. Stairs were the enemy.

This seems completely counterintuitive, but my self-esteem was better as an overweight woman. I gave fewer fucks about trying to impress people. I now find myself over analyzing every social interaction I have, making me an awkward mess.

Another counterintuitive thing, other people perceived me as stronger when I was overweight. Now people (well, men usually) rush to try to help me lift slightly heavy objects.

My energy levels as an overweight woman were sinusoidal. I think this was because of the high carb garbage I ate. Felt drained &gt; consumed sugar &gt; energy increased &gt; crash &gt; feel drained &gt; repeat.

Lastly, my cat liked my overweight body more. She doesn't seem happy laying on my boney legs, haha!"

With three kids. No fucking way this was going to happen in anything other than my imagination.

Okay...on a surface level, I understand and I sympathize...except when you start to dig deeper, you realize they feel left behind *because* people of color are being treated better and are succeeding more and more. 

Um. Sorry, but how am I supposed to feel sorry for them now? 

It's like, any issue that plagues poor white communities—lack of jobs, rampant drug addiction—is usually ALSO a problem that affects poor POC communities. Except people use sympathetic tones when discussing the poor white communities, and angry and judgmental sneers when discussing the poor POC communities. There's a ""heroin epidemic"" in poor white communities and ""they were really relying on Trump to help them out because they're sick of their children dying."" Yet ""black people are drug-dealers and this is why it's okay if a cop shoots them on sight! They were crack-dealing thugs anyway."" 

That difference right there is why I afford very little pity or sympathy for the poor, white, working class. They STILL have white privilege, they STILL get treated more nicely by the media and society, and they're STILL so bigoted and petty that they feel ""unfairly left out"" when POC succeed...as if this country wasn't built to specifically further white success.

&gt;I once, briefly, helped out with some slushpile reading for a publisher of erotic fiction, and you're right: you know you're going to reject a good 80% or more of manuscripts within the first two or three pages... The additional wrinkle with erotic fiction is that it has to be arousing, of course, which much of the stuff submitted just wasn't. Also, those who attempt to write it should have at least a passing familiarity with basic human anatomy.

* Sex in a public restroom (ideally somewhere nice - like in the bathroom of a really fancy restaurant)

Edit: Just remembered I did have sex in the bathroom back in high school. But I want to do it again - somewhere nice this time!"
304,Bottled water (where I live tap water is perfect). So wasteful.
305,"When I was 19, I feel in love with someone who was completely wrong for me. Despite this I still tried to do everything to make him happy, I wanted to be with him forever and couldn't imagine it any other way. 

Eventually he turned emotionally abusive and I tried to put up with it, making excuses for his behavior. None of my friends understood why and hated him. I still loved him. 
One day I started thinking about my future and my career and it really didn't involve being held back. So I just packed my shit and left. A month later it was my bday and immediately people were like wow, you have developed a glow I haven't seen in a really long time. I'm most happy about it because I discovered my self worth and realized what I should and shouldn't put up with not only in a relationship but from other people. "
306,"Very rarely have I come across women who are mean and catty to other women for no reason, or competitive with other women. The whole ""women can't be friends with each other"" thing. Sure, there's some, but I think it's just because they're shit people not because they're female. I have plenty of close female friends I'd do anything for and vice versa,, ande VAST majority of women I know are at minimum polite to each other."
307,"What is a dog, did you mean doggo?"

312,My best friend at the time and her mother were just so much more competitive than my mother and I. You were supposed to stay in your neighborhood back then but she had gone everywhere and had cornered the market. It was so demoralizing. I never sold any 😒
313,"Tbf I think that was because many people didn't realise they had changed the law regarding the heir so that it didn't matter if it was a boy or not. They assumed it would have to be a boy to be next in line. 

I guess that is my thing that changed, women are no longer the last resort in that regard they can be born the future Queen! "
314,"It's not that they don't notice, its more likely that they don't know what to say or how to help you.  I guarantee they love you, and are worried about you, but are at a loss as to what to do. 

I have been suicidal, probably more so than I realized. Mine is chemical, diet, DNA and circumstantial. I have the full spectrum from really, really bad days to pretty good days, and at one point, on a not so bad day, I realized that I *had* to participate in my own recovery.  

I know you didn't ask for advice, but I am going to give you some anyway.  Firstly, get out of bed.  I know you're tired, I know you're limbs are heavy, and you just don't want to, but I'd like you to get out of bed and take a shower please.  Wash your hair, your face, scrub yourself, shave something if you'd like, (or not).  And then put on clean clothes, pajamas if need be, whatever you'd like, but clean.  And then, if you really, really want to, you can go back to bed, and repeat this tomorrow.  BUT, if you stay vertical, even if its just sitting at a pc browsing reddit, you will feel just the slightest bit better.

Participation in life is the first step.  Nothing at all is going to get better by itself, and I promise you, I'm not implying that you're not trying, I swear I'm not, but even the smallest things, a little bit everyday, can make a difference, and lying in bed is only going to make things worse.

Things get better.  pm me if you'd like."
315,"Same here, age 11. I remember it all too well. Nascent breasts appeared, and just like that, it was **on**. Full blast. 

Grown men. I'm walking to school with a She-Ra backpack, and grown, could-be-my-father-aged men are saying… nasty things. Rubbing against me on the bus. Flashing me on the street. What an introduction to male desire."

317,"How very broke being her MOH made me.  At the time, I was working part-time at a coffee shop, making barely over minimum wage.  I was living with my parents, so no rent, but like 90% of my monthly wages went toward food, gas and student loans.  My friend (the bride) was nice enough to pay for my dress, but that still left me on the hook for bachelorette party, bridal shower, gift, hair, makeup and shoes.  Her family was too lazy/broke to throw the shower, and her other bridesmaids helped as little as possible (both with planning and money).  In order to be able to throw her a potluck shower and a small, minimalist bachelorette party, I had to be constantly available to cover extra shifts, cash in my dad's empties across state lines, and steal ""tips"" (we weren't allowed tips, but some customers didn't want their change and would leave it behind.  Two other girls would steal them anyway, so I beat them to it).  Even that wasn't enough, so I resorted to putting the last expenses on my ""emergency only"" credit card and paying it off very slowly over the next several months."

321,"I'm clingy.  I used to think it was a maturity thing that I'd grow out of, but I've realized it has a lot to do with having social anxiety.  I just do not have the energy for more than one person at a time, and that gets overbearing really quickly."
322,"Someone to do something for me that I can do myself - could be a manicure, gardening work, painting and decorating the house, basic repairs, laundry services or cleaning. "
323,Very comfortable looking and clean bed/bedding. I will snuggle that hard.
324,"This kills me. In my old apartment that I shared with my brother I used to have the most elegant bookshelf: a built-in hardwood china cabinet with glass doors. It was filled with the gems of my library: Borges, Pynchon, Eco, but also writers like Kapuscinski, Gene Wolfe, and Calvino. Of course I had many more books, but only the top 50 or so made it on to the shelf,  and whatever I was reading at the time. It was my pride and my joy.  



I ended up being out of the country for six months or so, and in the interim my brother decided to move,and so we end up losing the apartment. He didn't want to wait for me to come back , so just moved my meager possessions himself. Many months later, when I'm back and set up again, I ask him for the books back. It turns out he's been keeping them in a box and using them to hold a wonky door closed.  An *exterior* door. Twenty eight years of distilled reading lying rain-sodden and swollen in a busted cardboard box. God damn. "

327,"God, I got into an argument about this with a male friend of mine. He tried to argue that men and women experience the pressures of this equally, and that society doesn't pressure people to conform to beauty standards that much in general. When I laid out like, basically an essay on my own personal experiences detailing how he was wrong, his counter argument was essentially ""well I've never experienced it and I don't treat people that way so I think you're overreacting.""

SO INFURIATING"
328,"My husband is thankfully enlightened. He knows all about emotional labor, and while I still do a majority of it, It's for the same reason I do most of the cooking. I'm better at it, because I've had more practice. 

The first time he invited family to stay for the holidays, we had a come to jesus meeting afterwards about how much extra work it entailed for me. I listed out every singe tiny little thing I had to do which went completely unnoticed by everyone except my sister in law (who was impressed and very grateful.) We still host family for the holidays, but each year, I make that list again, and he does his very best to do as much as he can on it. He's getting close to the halfway mark. It's been a tremendous effort to teach him how to be a hostess, but he's a great pupil.

We had a similar discussion regarding cooking dinner. He thought for a long time that if he asked what's for dinner, and then cooked it, he'd made dinner for me. I explained that there's a lot of hidden labor there - deciding on a meal, grocery shopping, meal prep, doing the dishes, etc. Since then, we meal prep and shop together, and take turns cooking and cleaning up. 

Now that he's had those two lessons, he's a lot more likely to notice and appreciate and pitch in with all the emotional and hidden labor that goes into running a household. "

My sister has a similar story, when she met her boyfriend in high school and he took her home to meet his parents his mom would become embarrassed that the house was a mess and would get up to clean ahead of time. Apparently she was very depressed and would barely leave the bedroom. Now thanks to my sister she was getting up, cleaning, and interacting with others, breaking her depression. it's been nearly 10 years and they're still together and the mom is ok. :) "

336,"All the goldfish died.

My sister was getting married and had these center pieces with vases full of water with 2-3 goldfish in each one, and orange tiger lilies around it. I put the goldfish in the vases the night before the wedding (I followed all the directions, I swear, setting their bag in the water for a few hours to make sure the shock of the temperature change in the water didn't kill them!), and when we got to the venue in the morning, they were all dead.

We didn't let my sister see. We shuttled her into the make-ready area and sent one of the other bridesmaids to the pet shop to get emergency goldfish. They only had enough goldfish to put one fish in each display, but luckily she was too distracted by other things to notice.

I still feel bad for those poor goldfish, I'm sure I did something wrong and killed them all but I have no idea what I did wrong. I'm a mass fish murderer."

349,"Do you drive now? For me, the catcalls didn't stop until I got off the street. At some point I noticed it had really dropped off, and I figured I had aged out of it. I was about 30 at the time and I was like, ""oh thank fuck, it's over now."" Wrong. Ended up without a car for a couple of months and I was right back in it, as ever. And that's when I realized it wasn't my age, it was my *car*. I'd barely been getting catcalled simply because I was barely on the street.

I'm 40 now and *still* getting shit in the 3.2 minutes it takes to get from [whatever building] to my parking space. The only real difference is that the men are slightly older: 30s and up, instead of 20s and up. Result, the catcalls are in general slightly less crass. But they definitely still do it.

Maybe when I'm 50 I can walk to the store in peace."

I did not have other family in the area and my dad owned his business and was the sole employee, my mom was a SAHM, so it wasn't like they could sell on our behalf.

And then when I woke up in another city having been put into a coma, I handled it by entirely shutting down and being cold to others.

And in my twenties I handled it by expressing my fears with levelheaded partners, warning them about my ptsd, and dealt with them.

In my 30s I have found the ways that initial deserving thought has manifested in other aspects of my life and now I'm handling it by trying to unpack which parts are nature and which parts are nuture.

Someone who makes you feel bad for expressing yourself, if they do something to upset you and you try to talk about it - they instead will make you comfort them for feeling bad about making you feel bad. Instead of just apologizing. 

They will start to make you question your perception of the world and will frequently call you flaky or an airhead. They will get you to agree you have a bad memory and then will use it often to waive away problems they caused.

They will try to argue away your uneasy feelings using technicalities or 'logic' to convince you that you are being unreasonable - it becomes easier to just back down instead of standing up for yourself because when you stand up for yourself they just make you feel stupid. ((It doesn't actually matter in a relationship how logically you express yourself - your partner should want to make you feel comfortable and happy no matter what, you aren't in debate class, you are with someone who claims to love you))

I realized the problem is more at work. I would say no and list reasons, those reasons would be rationalized and whittled down until my no became a ""Well, I suppose I could."" And then I would be left swamped and overwhelmed.

My boyfriend is Asian and used to drive the shuttle for our university, so he'll often ironically make fun of his  own driving when it's obviously someone else's fault (like if a driver cuts him off), and we think it's funny.

417,"This thread makes me sad. So many women seem to be really embarrassed of their bodies and sexuality. I understand some things might be difficult to ask, but many people here say they have difficulties asking oral. It's not like vagina is anything to be embarrased about. And kinkier things are normal too. You and your partner should be able to discuss sex and fantasies and what you would like to try. They might decline some things but it's ok to ask.

I don't mean to criticise any women commenting here who are embarrased of asking what they want. Just, there's still lots of things to do considering genders and sexual shame.

My own answer, hmm. Nowadays I discuss these things with partner openly and pretty early on. I have some kinks I feel little hesitant to speak very soon because I don't want them to understand wrong. I love spanking, being submissive, and bondage. I don't need these things to be sexually satisfied but if guy wants to try them it makes me happy. (Well, I need sexual dynamic where I'm more submissive one but that compatibility is clear from the start)

Edit: for clarity"

Also, I'm a gymnastics coach. Men's and women's artistic gymnastics are totally different sports."

421,"I had heard so many wonderful things about the implant, and I was so excited about never having to take the pill again when I got it (and I had my fingers crossed I'd get one period a year like my best friend does)! But unfortunately the implant and I don't get on. I had a period that lasted for five solid months, and I was the most exhausted I've ever been. I tried to stick it out incase things changed, but my hormones never balanced out with it, so now I'm back on the pill :( 

I'm so glad it works for most people, because it was so nice to not have to remember to take tablets! Hopefully one day they will make one that works for the weirdos like me "
422,You became the man you wanted to marry. Good job!
423,"My guess is the exposure to hardcore porn at a much younger age than in previous generations. 

So much brutal porn is out there, where the men roughly jackhammer the woman and carry out degrading acts on her (facials, rough anal, double penetration, water sports, hitting etc) and basically none of it is for the pleasure of the woman involved. Young boys watch this stuff as their first exposure to sex and think it's normal because all their friends watch it and this then eventually drips into real life, where they assume that sex is all about their dick and their enjoyment and give no thought to what the girl might want or enjoy because the actresses in porn appear to enjoy the acts they take part in. 

It's bloody horrible but absolutely rife amongst young boys and men. My sister is 13 and she's already getting requests to participate in sexual stuff that is absolutely not vanilla. I just hope she has the strength of character and knows enough of her own worth to tell them to fuck off and expects to be treated as a partner and a willing participant when she's older, not some mindless compliant fucktoy.

425,"I think this would be a deal-breaker for me. Snuggles first thing in the morning and last thing at night are highlights of my day, and I'd be really reluctant to give that up. "
426,"Socializing for the sake of socializing. 

I love being around people in theory, but it doesn't work that way. My energy just... goes. "
427,I gagged the feels down until I was able to think rationally about them again.
428,"Honestly I think it's more of an issue what both genders are taught about dating and such. Men are told to be forward and to keep pursuing even after a clear ""No"" . And women are being called hideous names when they are forward about what they want and are taught that the men need to fight to get the right to be with them.

This creates a shitty expierence for both sides. The best solution for the most part imho would be to just teach both sides that they need to be honest with what they want. So no more signs people need to interpret just a ""Hey, I wanna bone/date you"" from both sides and many of theese encounters would not happen.

Not all that's for sure, because assholes will be assholes."

I like this question."
430,"I avoid them as both friends and partners. They have some real problems with entitlement that I find pretty gross. 

Unless you just mean nice people and then I love 'em. 

I don't know what you mean by resurgence.. they've always been around. 
"
431,"I feel it goes deeper than that:

Guys are taught that girls will play hard to get or play games in general or that they flirt very subtly, so some of them think a very subtle sign indicates interest (ie; a guy asking if because he wore a red shirt one day and a girl he likes wore a red shirt the next day that meant she was hinting she liked him....) Of course a lot of men know the difference, but it's always jarring, surprising when a guy needs help interpreting whether a girl likes that.

Women are taught at a young age that men will be straightforward, so again, it seems like some women will just wait for a guy to hit on them without even making the first move (ie; see a cute guy at the bar? go and talk to him! don't sit across the bar and make eyes at him and hope that he notices it).

Like you said, if both could be straightforward with one another, and both be raised KNOWING that the other person will be straightforward and won't play mega subtle flirtations or that they shouldn't always wait for a guy to make the first move...."
432,Was looking for that comment. Wasn't disappointed.
433,"My wife does the same thing. That, and if there's ever an issue, it's brought up immediately and resolved. There has been no disagreement that hasn't been solved the day of or the morning after. I've dated too many ""you should know what's wrong and fix it before I tell you I've been seething for two weeks"" women and it's nice to actually finally have open communication."
434,"Find one you feel comfortable in and just go with it.

I think the most important thing is to keep busy.  Keep your mind off of it.  No one expects you to be a swimsuit model.  You're just wearing a swimsuit because you're doing things in or near the water.  "
435,"Yes - mine too. And he gets all weird when you point them out, like cmon man I've only seen better eyelashes on dairy cows (have you seen those things? Gorgeous) "
436,"Ugh, yes! Goes hand in hand with ""women are the only ones who want to get married"" bullshit (as if everyone wanted to get married anyway!). It annoys me to no end."
437,"You know, I've never once thought those could be separate numbers, but it makes perfect sense they would be. Neat!"
438,We're going to need a new sub for this type of question. I propose u/askaskwomenmen.
