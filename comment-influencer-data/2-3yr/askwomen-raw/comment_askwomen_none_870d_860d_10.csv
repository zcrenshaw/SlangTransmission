0,Checking out attractive women. 
1,Used a Nair upper lip kit to get rid of my upper lip hair. The chemical burn in the shape of a moustache made me look *soooo* beautiful. 
2,"I think I'm on the cusp of the very last few years of men who didn't grow up with internet porn. They certainly had it, but not until they were generally past 12 or so. 

I worked with young women until recently, and the way porn is changing their expectations and relationships is frankly horrifying. They accept that boys will pretty much demand all sorts of sexual activities they don't like, or are frankly humiliating. They also objectify themselves even more than teen girls did when I was that age. They're hyperconcerned about the shape of their labia, about the size and look of their genitals in general because there's so much shaming. They feel *obligated* to shave because boys their own age have said that their public hair is ""gross."" Ugh! I know some girls fight back, or don't care, but it really effects so many of them deeply."
3,"Choose to be near the most/more attractive women, in for example, group settings. I work with a lot of highschool students and they get put into groups with university undergrad helpers. I tell them to match up with someone of a similar subject interest. But every time, the guys gravitate towards the more attractive female undergrads regardless of subject and try to make it seem like it's a subtle ""Oh I'm just interested in her subject!"". Oh really, because I really doubt that every male in your class just happens to be interested in Anglo-Saxon Studies since that is so statistically unlikely, but the undergrad is wearing a crop top, so you tell me why you're in her group!"
4,adjust their junk
5,"When I was a teenager someone told me that widow's peaks were ugly, so I shaved mine off. Obviously it grew back and I had a terribly awkward tuft of hair that grew straight up in the center of my forehead for way too long. Worst decision ever. "
6,"Contrary to the popular saying, bad sex is not ""like pizza: even when it's done bad, it's still pretty good.""  For me, bad sex is painful and not good in any way. Imagine if bad sex felt like your dick was getting scraped against sand paper every time you thrust in and out, and tell me whether it's still ""pretty good."""
7,"* Never accept drinks from strangers.

* Never leave my drink unattended. Never. If I'm alone and my friends are not there to keep an eye on it I even take it to the toilet."
8,"I find that many don't understand feminism. They make no effort to understand the history, the whys and how's of feminism. You need to understand the Betty Friedan as well as the Gloria Steinem school of thought.

Nowadays, I feel it's just being misused as an excuse for disrespectful behaviour and hypocrisy- not by everyone but some. "
9,"- Never wear short skirts or high heels if I know I'll be walking home alone late at night.

- Don't use my actual picture as a profile picture on apps and websites.

- If I was dating I would tell my friends who I was meeting, where I was meeting them and how long I expected to be gone.

- When at bars: always order drinks in a bottle, as a bottle opening is easier for me to cover and harder for creeps to put something in."
10,"I am about as pale as they come, practically glow in the dark. All the girls in school were tan and I wanted to fit in. So one day I go put on my swim suit, lather myself up in some baby oil (thank you Mom for that bit of advice) and lay on my stomach in the back yard reading the newest Harry Potter book (I think it was half blood prince). Next thing I know I'm waking up from an accidental nap and covered in second degree burns. The worst part was I had given myself a weggie so I wouldn't have obvious tan lines and that little strip of ass cheek that never before saw the light of day was bleeding and so painful. I fried myself to a crisp.

Edit: Actually I think it was the Goblet of Fire now that I'm thinking about it...

Tldr: Protect your skin kids, use sun block not baby oil. "
11,"My favourite example of this happened when I was in university. I was sitting in a coffee shop, waiting for a friend while reading a book. A guy approached me and commented that I seemed engrossed and when I told him I was he *thanked* me for enjoying ""his book"" and said something about how nervous he'd been while writing. 

The book had been written by my professor. There was a photo of him on the back. It would've only taken a couple minutes, max, to figure out that this guy hadn't written it. Why lie about something that is so easy to disprove? "
12,I cheated on my boyfriend when I was 16 because I didn't want to date him any more and was too scared to break up with him. I felt so guilty though that I confessed - he didn't catch me. He just said 'oh right. Well don't do it again' at which point I decided that I needed to gather some courage and just end the relationship. 16 year old me was a wimp. I should have just broken up with him.

14,"Questioning their choices and preferences in dating. People who date for social status, wealth...the criticism is all directed to women almost exclusively. There were two female models in my high school, they were often on the cover of teenage fashion magazines. Half of the guys at school would try to date them as soon as they learned they were doing modeling, without knowing *anything* else about them and not being attracted to them before hearing the title 'model'. I work in the entertainment industry as an adult. I have seen again and again things like guys try to date women who are popular/have rich parents/has the title model/are famous or have famous friends although they had a bunch of dealbreakers in the eyes of those guys. They seem to be completely unaware how much a woman's social status is a factor in their attraction. So much that at least two guys I know, both in their late 30s, ALWAYS been in a relationship with models since their early 20s, and still criticize or make fun of women who date within specific job or wealth groups."
15,"I think all people exagerate a bit to impress someone they're attracted to. What surprises me is how often guys straight out lie, and choose lies that are easy to see through.

I don't call them out on the lies, just write off the guy as a liar. And they never suspect I saw straight through the obvious lie - which astounds me."
16,"i'm just here to remind everyone that he bragged about owning an ''empire'' on TRP while being the *lead kazooist* of his *one man band*.

honestly at this point, people in power in the united states being outed as belonging to the alt-right just isn't as shocking as it should be. it's more of shocking in a ''hah, figures'' way than a ''how could this beeee'' way."
17,"How periods work.

You'd be surprised how many moms with only sons hide any evidence they have natural body processes, and then often boys don't learn about them properly in school either, and girls are socialized not to talk about them except to other girls...

So then you get men who grow up to be managers in corporations etc. spouting absolute crap about their conception of the effect periods have on women's bodies and capabilities, often managing to over- and under-estimate the impact they have in the same sentence.

(e.g. underestimating how painful or inconvenient they are, but then suggesting things like the act of having a period will somehow mess up the brain or thought processes and make someone 'crazy' and irrational -_- )"
18,"I cheated because I was trapped in an abusive relationship and I needed to get out. Leaving him felt impossible, in ways I imagine it's difficult for someone who has never been abused to understand. I felt like I was too weak to just walk out the door and too dependent on him. I thought if I cheated then he would never take me back and it would be the only way I could escape. So I cheated on him. I made plans to leave. He logged into my emails and found out, printed them out and then confronted me when I came home. I told him the truth and he asked if we could be in an open relationship. I said no. I left. He eventually guilted me into coming back and then when I left again he assaulted me. 

Cheating was cowardly of me and I regret it. I've been cheated on and it's the absolute worst. I wish I had been strong enough to just leave the first time. I'm so happy I left but I regret how I went about it. I've never cheated again on anyone else. "
19,"If I really like someone, I tease them, ask them a lot of overly personal questions, and am generally abrasive.  It seldom works.  "
20,"Allow yourself some time to feel all of it. Importantly, be kind to yourself - if you want to cry, cry. There were many days I snuck into the bathroom at work to let the tears flow. But keep pulling yourself back up and together!

For me, the gym provided great outlet for all of these overwhelming emotions. I ran and lifted a lot. I rediscovered yoga and meditation that gave me positive vibes. I also Netflix binged on all sorts of mindless shows - Gilmore Girls, Drop Dead Diva, Love, etc.

I learned to cook all kind of different dishes. I went to cooking classes with my sister. I made more effort to see my friends who were incredibly supportive.

A quote that I found really helpful: ""Life is constantly moving, and the best thing to do is to move forward with it."" 

Hugs. "

22,"When I was a teen learning to drive, I was taught to avoid parking on the passenger side of a truck or minivan. This helps avoid someone snatching you as you're trying to get in your car. 

20 years later, I still keep this in mind. And I'm always alert if I go to return to my car and see a van has parked next to me while I was out. "
23,"I don't know.  

It is very hard for me to wrap my head around the environment that young woman are developing in, where we have all this instantaneous communication and social media.  Sometimes I'm envious, other times I think I would not have fared very well.  

For example, I think it would have been good if I'd had the internet to help me find ""my people"" and widen my circle of friends.  On the other hand, I think I would have been very vulnerable to anonymous criticism and cyberbullying.  But if I'd grown up with this being the normal state of affairs?  Maybe I'd have some toughness and boldness that would help me cope.

I also cannot imagine dating life in the age of texting.  My god.  All through adolescence I was super boy-crazy inside, but I was unattractive and a know-it-all so outside I was nerdy and aloof.  I had all this pent-up emotion inside and I was always on the brink of going full-out obsessed stalker.  This lasted... beyond adolescence, to be honest.   I shudder to think of what I might have been like if I had today's communication technology and my needy, neurotic fingertips."
24,"Correct their posture around people they're attracted to/interested in. I have been legit surprised, the first time I've seen some men around someone they've got a thing for, to realize they were actually much taller than I realized. And its all I can do not to literally lol sometimes when they totally show their hand by being like king-of-the-slump hanging with friends until they realize I'm there and suddenly have like soldier/yogi straight spine and go all square-shouldered n stuff."
25,"Hm, I haven't had issues with my armpits itching as the hair grows back. 

Pubes though... oh dear GOD those itch like fucking crazy. So I deal with that by not shaving it."
26,Text my friends when I'm home safe. 
27,"Story time! This past New Year's Eve, I decided to go out by myself. I wanted to see this band and my friends were either out of town or had other plans so, off to the bar by myself. I had a great time and the guitarist spent all of his breaks hanging out with me. So during one of the breaks, I'm standing outside on the sidewalk, talking to some of the band members when this swarthy fella walks up to me, stands waaaaay too close and proceeds to politely introduce himself. The standing too close put me on the defensive, so I made eye contact with guitarist/new friend and mumbled something about needing to get something out of my car. Guitarist friend made a point of asking me where my car was. 

I go sit in the car for a minute and then wander back into the bar. Swarthy guy is nowhere around, so cool. I find a good spot to sit in front of the band for the last set, and settle in. (They really rocked it that night, too. Great show.) Suddenly, I realize that Swarthy Guy is standing over me. I look up and he asks me what I'm drinking. Now I've gone out alone on NYE so I'd decided not to drink at all before I went out in case the cops were doing sobriety checks on my route somewhere. Normally, I wouldn't think twice about having a glass of wine or two and then driving home (still under the legal limit), but on NYE, I wasn't taking any chances at all. 

I tell Swarthy Guy, ""I'm not drinking at all, thank you. I'm driving."" So he walks away and I'm thinking, cool. 

Five minutes later, Swarthy Guy walks back up, set down a glass of wine, not on the table in front of me but two tables away -- I'd have to get up to pick up the wine. He says to me, ""I put your wine on that table there."" 

So now I'm really annoyed at the total disregard for my boundaries. I specifically said no and gave a legit reason, despite not owing some stranger a reason at all for saying no and this jerk goes and buys a glass of wine anyway. But the thing was, I had been totally focused on the music and not paying any attention at all so who the hell knows what happened to that wine from the time the bartender poured it to the time Swarthy Guy set it down in front of me? Plenty of time to stir a roofie in there or something. Aw, hell no. Without even thinking or looking up and making eye contact, I snarled at him, with the most irritated tone of voice ever and said, ""That's not my wine! I told you I'm not drinking!"" And went back to laser-focus on the band. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw him give me a nasty look and he left the bar shortly thereafter. I did not touch that wine. 

So if you're a dude and you're reading this and you think this is a chivalrous, generous, kind thing to do, please stop. I'm sure you and Swarthy Guy are nice fellas and all, but if a woman says no, thank you, you respect that no! No means fucking no and that includes ""no thanks, I'm not drinking tonight."" If you won't respect that little no, what happens if I'm dating you and you want me to do something I don't want to do and you've already established that you think you know better than I do what I want, so are you going to respect that no? 

I don't fucking think so. "
28,"I used to separate my eyelashes with a safety pin.  I don't even have steady hands.  I poked myself in the eye once, but thankfully my don't-stab-yourself-in-the-eye-for-vanity-you-fucking-idiot reflexes kicked in and I managed not to blind myself.  "
29,"I'm always amazed by how my pre-teen views equality. She simply expects it and always notices when it's absent. For example, we watched A League of Their Own last week and she kept saying 'OMG that is SO sexist!' Her mind just assumes that women and men will be treated equally and it catches her attention in a major way when that's not the case. 

Same with race. She babbles incessantly about her school friends and I've realized I always assume they are white until I meet them. I'm always a bit shocked when I see them in person. My generation tends to use race as a descriptor second only to gender. It's assumed that the person you're describing is of your own race unless you specifically say otherwise. 'You know, the black girl that's sits behind so-and-so in math class' is what we would've said in middle school days. My daughter simply says 'she sits behind so-and-so in math class.' It's a total lack in ethno-centristism (is that a word?) that never ceases to amaze me. 

As for the millennials, I've noticed that they need more hand-holding in the workplace. They are bright and eager but often fail to apply critical thinking skills to situations. Good judgment is a learned skill and it seems like maybe they have been spoon-fed all their life or something? I find I need to be very specific when assigning work so they are able to deliver results that meet expectations. They show a lot of initiative and have a solid work ethic so it's just a matter of being crystal clear and following up to ensure they don't get stalled along the way. I wish I could put my finger on why they tend to be like this so I could be better at managing them. "

31,"An older male coworker told me, ""You shouldn't look so mean walking down the street. You're going to scare all the men away."" I responded, ""Exactly.""

""But a smile from a woman can really make a guy's day."" I just stared at him stone-faced until he went away
"
32,"I mentioned being nervous to walk home at night to my male coworkers. They insisted that I was just being paranoid, that ""nothing ever actually happens"" and ""you just need to walk with confidence, seem intimidating and you'll be left alone!""

Uh, no. I'm a 5'0'' woman living in an area with high crime. I'm not going to intimidate anyone lol"
33,The boob/butt look. Just because I looked away from your face for a second does not mean I did not miss your stare at my chest. Just because I turned around to face you does not mean I missed your eyes flying up from my ass.
34,Because it comes in stick form. 
35,"Anxiety. Not just your average case of anxiety, but debilitating anxiety."
36,"The other day my bf and I were talking about how bad this intersection was for pedestrians, he then suggested that the city should build a tunnel instead. 

I told him right away that I would avoid at all costs this part of the city if it was the case. 

After explaining myself he realized how different it is for a woman even to walk in the street. "
37,"When you're in a bar or something and they scoot by you and act like it's necessary to grope your lower back and/or ass. It's like dude, there is plenty of space for you to walk through, there is no need to touch me, and I do in fact have nerves there and know you're touching me. And if you have to, just touch my shoulders or something. It is glaringly obvious why you've chosen to slide your hand all around my body instead of just squeezing through.

That and guys who put their arm around you and strategically place it just not quite right under your boob, acting like they don't know where their hand is."
38,"&gt; But you know what two-way conversation I'm never going to have with a woman is? About how interesting special relativity is. 

&gt;**How I consider the free-will argument to be moot because time travel causes paradoxes that render the concept nonsensical.**

I know this is a minor thing to be annoyed about, but this is just so laughably idiotic. As far as we know, time travel isn't actually possible. It goes against our understanding of the fundamental laws of the universe. So he's disregarding a philosophical concept as worthy of discussion because of ***science fiction***. That's just precious."
39,"It was in the early days of my bisexual awakening before I'd even been with a woman... I guess I watched too much porn because I figured a strap-on was an essential part of lesbian stuff, and I didn't want to be the loser without a strap-on... So I bought one. 

Turns out no woman I ever hooked up with even uses one. I did try it, but there's *so* much other better stuff to do without toys. By the time I remember I own a strap-on, we've already been fucking for 2 hours and I'm like crap I need to sleep because I have work tomorrow.  "
40,"To quote Ann Perkins ""Jogging is the worst! I know it keeps you healthy, but God, at what cost?"""
41,Ok well one time I figured Nair could also remove pubes just fine because hair is hair right? I mean if you can put it on leg skin why can't you put it on OH SWEET BABY JESUS WHAT HAVE I DONE 
42,"I always take my phone with me to the bathroom. At my university, guys have been walking into girls bathrooms being weird. One guy got caught because the girl had her phone so she could call right away and take a photo. "
43,"wear heels

they're bad for your spine"
44,"Talk... once or twice a week.  However... we email each other every day.  

My sister (64) and I (61) are both retired, happily single and live alone, about 2 miles apart.  

Our morning emails are to connect and make sure we're both alive and not lying unconscious on the bathroom floor or whatever.  Touching base with a sentence or two is a nice way to start off each day. 

We play Scrabble once a week (winters in my condo, summers on her back deck) so we catch up on all the details then.  "
45,Couldn't date a guy who didn't really like cuddles. I require so many we just wouldn't work out.
46,Yes. The body language in general is different. They try very hard to pretend like they're not doing anything out of the ordinary.
47,"I actually just had a moment like this a few weeks ago!

I dated someone for three years, we broke up, visceral heartbreak, he went on to date someone else and get married, I sunk into a depression (my mom had passed away prior to our break up as well.) 

I finally got my life together. Finished grad school. Lost 40 pounds, took up an instrument and joined a band. A few weeks ago I was walking into a gig and I saw him and his wife at a table. God, it was so fucking validating, because for so long I lived in fear of seeing him out because I was so hurt. And now he was going to watch me play music on a stage and it just was such a reminder of how far I'd come, and how the person I am today is so much more evolved than when we were together."
48,"So many types of stain removal, especially blood."
49,"As a teen: stuffed my bra

Recently: got eyelash extensions, they were pretty.  But I was not a big fan of them. I could not rub my eyes freely as I wished. And we all know that amazing feeling you get when you rub your eye...or is that just me..?"
50,"The company I work for is mostly run by older men but my department specifically has just women in it. 3 of us are younger woman in our 20s and our older male coworkers like to give use advice regardless if we ask for it or not. Their advice almost always about pleasing our future husbands or our boyfriends and I'm not sure if they realize how they sound most of the time. The one woman in my department mentioned her dog and almost immediately on of the guys says ""Why did you get a dog? What if your future husband doesn't like dogs?"" or another time I mentioned that I'm trying to learn how to cook more and I get a gem about how that will make me a great wife. I know it sounds crazy but.....maybe our lives aren't centered around men?!? Every hobby we mention is scrutinized about whether our ""future husbands"" will approve or not and they always sounds so proud of themselves for giving great advice. We always tend to laugh it off when they leave.  "
51,"Had the best first date of my LIFE with a guy I met on OkCupid. We were a 99% match on their awesome weighted algorithm. It was so great, we ended up in bed together. A couple weeks later, after arranging our next date, I found out I was pregnant. Completely freaked out, I decided to get an abortion and broke it to him via text pretty vaguely. Then, I ghosted him. 

That really messed me up for a while. He would find me on social media randomly every year and message to ask how I was doing. Never blamed me for anything and just genuinely wanted to see how I was and what was going on in my life. 

Four years later, something sort of traumatic happened and I needed someone to talk to. I decided to call him after a few glasses of wine. He was the only one who knew about my abortion. After a really long conversation, we decided to meet up again since I'd be traveling through his town. 

Once I got there I never left. Now we're married with a second child on the way. He's awesome."
52,"Omg I will be sitting at my desk, face at crotch level and one of my colleagues who is taller will come up with a question and adjust himself multiple times during our convo. I just avert my eyes or act busy but seriously?? You have to see that my face is at eye level---how do you not realize how obvious it is???"
53,"One time my husband had a friend over. The friend cut his hand open and bled on a towel. Husband didn't know how to remove the stain so I told him to use cold water. Husband said something like ""It's kind of unsettling that you know how to remove blood stains."" I had to remind him of my monthly bleeding since junior high, lol. "
54,"Anyone reading this not yet in college: you need to start this now. I cannot tell you how often campuses have assaults, thefts, or worse because kids move into the residence halls and aren't in the habit of locking the door ALL THE TIME. "
55,"Wrong time, wrong place."
56,"I actually used to go jogging.  

*What the hell was I thinking???*"
57,"Guy here. Even I roll my eyes when I see this on the subway:
    
Woman seated (aisle seat or inward-facing seat). 
    
Man boards train, looks around, gradually making his way to the spot *right in front of* the said seated woman (there is plenty of room elsewhere in the car).
    
Man turns and faces seated woman so his crotch is at eye level with her, grabs the overhead bar, and begins casually reading his book/newspaper/etc.
    
Man wants you to think his inner dialogue is something like ""Oh, I guess I'll just board this car...heck, looks like there's some standing space over there...well, now that I'm here I might as well continue reading...I have no idea I'm standing in front of anyone, man or woman...with plenty of room throughout the car.""
    
Real subtle."
58,"Some excerpts of his comments:

&gt;Due to statutory rape laws, perfectly viable women under 18 are out of bounds. Fine. Evolutionarily, that was never a problem, but today we have to deal with it. So 18 is the bottom end. And for women, 30 is wall. So women have a window of 12 years.

&gt;There is literally no legal protection I can think of that could eliminate the risk of a previous sexual partner of mine falsely accusing me of rape, no matter what the circumstances. I now have a video recorder in my room.

&gt;Also if she feels insulted, your incidence of false rape accusations or pregnancy scares go waaaaaaaaay up. You might think I'm paranoid, but statistically, I'm overdue for a false rape allegation.

&gt;When I'm out with friends, including girls, you know EXACTLY what the conversation will entail, it's gossip or fashion, pop culture, trendiness, personal experiences. Nothing abstract. They do not chat in the abstract...when I told myself I thought they were smart, I really had the footnote in the back of my head... smart.. for a woman...But you know what two-way conversation I'm never going to have with a woman is? About how interesting special relativity is. How I consider the free-will argument to be moot because time travel causes paradoxes that render the concept nonsensical. Oh, sure, they'll be interested, or at least act like they are. But there will be no two way conversation...I don't hate women. I just understand what use they are to me.

&gt;I find women's personalities in general to be lackluster and boring, serving little purpose in my day to day life.

&gt;women will gladly see to it that you do, in fact, die alone...Women will do what they want. They will do what ever fits their fancy. They just plainly do not give a shit!...But you have to be awake to the reality that in the woman's mind- her emotions are the only thing that matters to her. She will be fickle and can easily up and leave with literally no regrets..."
59,"I've heard this quote attributed to Margaret Atwood: 
""Men are afraid that women will laugh at them. Women are afraid that men will kill them.""

For any men reading this thread, I hope you have some awareness of why we have such a justified fear for our safety. 

While I've been fortunate not to have had a serious situation happen to me, I have been in situations where I was made to feel very uncomfortable and fear for my safety. I generally keep to myself when I'm out and about but I've learned in this thread there's a few things I'm doing wrong as well. 

"
60,"In the fall of my junior year in high school, my senior boyfriend of one year dumped me because he was applying to Harvard, where he would have the opportunity to meet ""hotter, smarter, richer girls"". Throughout our relationship, he would often put me down and remind me how lucky I was to have him. Alas, despite going around telling everyone how he was sure to get into Harvard, he was rejected (from Harvard and the other Ivies he'd applied to) and ended up attending our local college.

We lost contact until last March, when I went home for Spring Break and ran into him at a Starbucks. He smugly told me that he was in the process of applying for transfer admission to Harvard and Yale before asking me where I was attending college. I couldn't help but grin when I told him Yale."
61,"All these ladies saying that they have their keys in between each finger wolverine style ready in their pocket in case shit goes down is kinda worrying to me. This is not a very good tactic to employ if you absolutely have to fight someone. You will only end up with injuries to your hands, likely boxer fractures as the impact of the fist with the keys sticking out puts a lot of pressure on the fingers as well as a sprained wrist as you drive the keys into your hand when you hit something.

The human hand is pretty fragile when faced with strong impacts, and one of the best ways for it to endure a strong impact is for it to take a stable shape. a fist is one of the most stable forms a hand can take because it's tight and even so it is not as prone to breaking. Introducing keys to the equation will compromise the structural integrity of the fist you are making and really mess up your hands if you hit with even a small amount of force. Then you have simultaneously disabled yourself and enraged your attacker. Not a great situation to be in. 

You can use your keys by pinching the longest one and rapidly jabbing it into the face of whoever is attacking you. It's not damaging to your hand and if you hit the eyes or neck you can do some damage. Or if you hold the keys in such a way as some of them are sticking out of the bottom, you can hammer fist (Hitting something with the bottom of your fist through a downward swing). Both are much better alternatives.

Stay safe, ladies.

62,"I hope this salted caramel trend continues for a long time, because I fucking love anything with caramel (or butterscotch/toffee).
"
63,Negging. We know what you think you're up to and it's not a good look.
64,"My ex husband was using me as a beard and I got tired of compromising my own happiness and quality of life for someone who didn't give a shit about me. After 3 years of our marriage obviously falling apart, he made no effort to fix things, help himself, and even refused to see a couples therapist. Our parent's pressured us into marriage way too early-That is the only thing I regret. That and not having the maturity to walk away because I felt guilty for 'ruining my family'. 

He also anally raped me for doing a thing he did on a daily basis-seeking an emotional relationship with a person outside of our marriage. So man, I just stopped fucking caring. "
65,"That feeling emotion isn't ""weak"", it's the opposite. What's easier, blocking out your feelings with knee-jerk reactions, or pausing and feeling every bit of them? Everyone can block out feelings, we've done that since we were kids. But feeling pain takes *so* much strength. I have yet to meet a guy who is at that level of emotional maturity (and I'm only just getting there myself). 

Unfortunately all adults suppress stuff, because in general it's not acceptable to express emotion. Women are expected to be emotional, so in order to be taken seriously, we have to walk an impossibly fine line (like with Hillary Clinton being criticised both for smiling too much, and smiling too little). But toxic masculinity is why this extra fear of being ""weak"" is added to men's suffering. 

As someone who was a severe addict and is now dealing with my emotions. Trust me. This takes more strength and bravery than anything I've ever had to do. I'm not weak for feeling. "
66,"Porn is... complicated. I really don't think porn is to blame for young boys' expectations of sex, I think it's the fact that it's often *the only source they have on what a sexual relationship looks like.* At my (private religious) school, teachers didn't touch on sex other than ""don't do it until you're married."" My parents were exactly the same way, as were most of the parents of kids at my school. In public schools near me, I learned other kids were being taught about the biology of sex and how to have safe sex, but there wasn't a lot of talk about what healthy sexual relationships looked like. We were all told ""here's how to do it,"" but no one had an honest discussion about what it all means emotionally. When all the guys watch porn and see a variety of sex acts performed, they have no context for it. They apply the context of their own relationships to porn and now that's what they consider healthy sexual behavior.

This doesn't excuse boys who pressure young women and make demands of them that they are uncomfortable with. It's unacceptable behavior and needs to be corrected. I think we can prevent this kind of thing, though, through dialogue and healthier examples of positive sexual relationships, especially in early adolescence when sexual desires are just forming."
67,"When I was around 13/14, my Salvadorean mother told me that in order to get rid of acne, I had to pee on a rag and soak my face in it. So far, I think that's the dumbest thing I've ever done in the name of beauty. LOL 

EDIT- My mom pretty much grew up in the jungles of El Salvador *and I thought of course she knew something I didn't and @ that point, nothing was working. I mean, in retrospect, I was a teenager and it just had to run it's course, but she's mom! Needless to say, she was **shocked** it didn't work. "

69,"I watched the first three episodes last night, and I am shaken. I already requested the book from the library, I can't wait.

I think the scariest part is how possible it all feels. The gradual shift of societal roles and expectations that leads to the avalanche and nobody bats an eye. I think Offered said it well when she said, ""I'm awake to the world now. I used to be asleep."" The rise of the theocratic authoritarian regime in the story is enabled by a ""slaughter of Congress"" and ""institution of martial law"", which, ""they said would be temporary."" 

It really made me think about how close to that slippery slope we are right now. When Mike Pence won't be alone with women without his wife is he acting piously, or is he refusing women access to power and ""othering"" us? When Trump signs away funding for women's health clinics and reproductive rights, how far away are we really from forced birth situations? How different, really, is the far right's version of a ""Christian nation"" from the Sharia law they claim to hate and fear?

It also made me think about women in countries like Saudi Arabia whose lived experiences aren't too far from what the story is depicting. Unable to work, own property, or leave the house without a man. Were those women angry and confused when these changes took place? Was it a gradual chipping away of rights or an overnight tidal wave? Will we (in the US) notice if and when this style of theocracy comes here?

Basically, I feel like this story is a call to action. Whether that is donating to Planned Parenthood or supporting progressive candidates, or volunteering in my community, I feel a very personal responsibility to not be asleep to the world."
70,"In addition to all the stuff others have mentioned, I take measures to economically incentivize strangers to look out for my safety.

For example, when I'm going home late at night, I sit in the guard car so there's a staff member present. Then when I get home, I bing off a quick note to the train company saying ""Thank you to the guard in car #### for making me feel safe travelling alone late at night."" I do this even if the guard didn't do anything in particular to make me safe, because I know that when you work for a large organization, customer kudos are gold at performance review time.

If someone is following me down the street, I duck into a nearby business (pub, restaurant, coffee shop, etc.)  I sit down where I can see out the window, order a drink, and say ""I'm just waiting for the weird guy who was walking behind me to go away.""  Often they offer to help me, walk me the rest of the way home, let me call them to check in once I get home, etc.  Then when I get home, I send kudos to the owner (if it's indie) or to corporate (if it's a chain), and write them a five-star review on whichever site comes up first when I google for reviews of that business.  And then I come back when I'm going out for drinks with friends, and make sure they know that I'm giving them my business because they helped keep me safe when the weirdo was following me.

Some of the homeless guys in my neighbourhood harass people, and others are benign. I give large amounts to the regulars who are benign, but infrequently (e.g. $10-20, 2-3 times a year). This way, even when I walk past them without giving them money, they see me as a person who gives them money. As a result, a couple of times I've had homeless guys intervene when someone else was harassing me.  (Both times I got out of there while the incident was happening, but I came back and checked with the homeless guys the next day to make sure they were okay - they were, the harasser ran off - and brought them their favourite lunch with a bit of cash tucked into the bag.)"

74,"My former male roommate and family friend used to give me constant unsolicited advice on how to be more 'attractive' to guys that I always brushed off easily enough.

Like:
""You know, guys typically like girls that wear less makeup.""

""Don't work out your arms too much at the gym because it's unattractive when girls get too muscular""

But nothing quite set me off due to sheer bewilderment like,

""You know, you walk around really heavy footed in the apartment sometimes and you should really work on that, you know, a lot of guys are going to find that pretty unfeminine and unnatractive.""

OH, YES of course! Better be sure to make an effort to always walk gracefully around my old ass apartment (that's constantly creaky as hell anyway) so I can avoid the potential of someone possibly seeing me as unfeminine and therefore, unattractive.

It wasn't even like he was saying that as a way to ask me to be more quiet getting ready in the mornings, (which would have been a completely reasonable thing to bring up) but 100% in a 'omg you should be thanking me for giving you such great advice on how to be more attractive to men' patronizing bullshit tone.

76,"Being a lot nicer and attentive to people they find attractive. I don't even think they necessarily realize they do this, or I think many of them would be mildly appalled at how rude this can come off.

Shortly after, a set of tall, skinny blonde twins walks in and, no lie, every dude at the table STANDS UP to shake hands and make introductions. I've known these girls for a while and they're nice, but they don't have the most sparkling personalities, yet every guy at the table (even the ones in long-term committed relationships) was asking them questions and hanging on to their every word.

I've also been the ""pretty girl"" in these situations before and it is awkward because it's plainly obvious to everyone but these dudes when the attention shifts.

77,"Difficulty in launching a career and a traditional ""adult life"". it's not the Millennial Generation's fault that the price of tuition, housing, and health insurance skyrocketed by the time they came of age, and jobs that pay a living wage are disappearing. Blame Baby Boomer government &amp; economic policies for that one, but it means that Millennials seem to be having a harder time finding a living wage, moving out of their parents houses, and being independent. Gen-X didn't have it *great* in this respect but we had it much better than the Millennials did, and overall we seemed to move out and be independent at much earlier chronological ages. 

I'm glad I didn't come of age and date in a world where internet dating/tinder/hookup culture was prevalent. People were just starting to find dates online in the early 00's but it was just as common if not more to meet someone IRL (through a friend , at a party, etc).  It meant you got to know the person a little before the actual date and sex, so you weren't automatically passing on people if you didn't like their pic and swiped to the next one.  I didn't think my husband was the hottest guy when I first saw him. if it had been 15 years down the road I probably would have swiped the other way. I'm glad it was 2003 :)"

They had access to it once they were in their teen years (on a dial-up modem, though); and we'd have VHS porn tapes on in the background at parties - haha! But there was a very clear divide between 'porn' and 'real life' that everyone understood.

When I was a teen, saving 'down there' was a racy thing you did for your boyfriend once in a while. It was understood that men found it sexy, but it was certainly not an everyday expectation. It was a fun thing to do, kind of like ""being porn girl"" for the evening, although I didn't do it often because I didn't enjoy the process of shaving. It was a pain in the arse (not a pun). It was kind of analogous to wearing sexy lingerie or doing a strip tease. It was a once-in-a-while treat.

Since it's become an ""expectation"" I've stopped willingly doing it. It doesn't feel playful anymore. I'll tidy the area up before sleeping with someone new because I'm afraid I'll be shamed if I don't. Honestly, when I was a teen, I didn't even do that. If we were going to have sex, we'd have sex.

Date for homecoming has a mother who is apparently a bit overprotective and wouldn't like it and since she's driving, he asks me to take it out for the night.  I did.

But it was new so it closed quick and wouldn't go back in next morning.
I don't know where I summoned the balls, but I stood in the mirror and repierced that raw, purple eyebrow sore with nothing but rubbing alcohol, a lighter and a sewing needle.

143,"I really dislike men like that. The type of men who also get offended when they are walking behind a strange woman on the street, and the woman starts walking faster when she notices a strange man going in the same direction as her.

No, she doesn't automatically think you're a rapist, she is not going to the police and report you for walking behind her, it's just that violence against women is an ACTUAL CONCERN, not a made up fairy tale to scare children with. Womens safety is so so soooo much more important than your hurt feelings, and if you take it as an insult that a woman who doesn't know you is *concerned* you *might* hurt her, then you need to get your priorities straight buddy."

* I sit in the corners of rooms so I can see everyone.

* I wear practical shoes that I can run in if necessary. 

* I use my phone screen to check behind me if I'm walking somewhere alone.

* I pay a lot of attention to my surroundings (especially sounds) and I don't have my eyes glued to my phone. 

* I bring my massive dog with me whenever possible, especially if I'm going somewhere alone. My dog lays in the doorway and keeps an eye out whenever I'm using a bathroom or ATM. 

* I use reflections in windows and people's shadows to keep tabs on anyone behind me. 

* I don't dawdle in parking lots. 

* I play memory games with myself to see how many details I can remember from a particular person or vehicle, so that I can identify them later if necessary. 

* I am _never_ intoxicated around other people unless I really trust them, and I'm not alone with them.

I have pretty severe PTSD, so this is all hypervigilance nonsense for me, but it makes me feel safer and more in-control, and it works."
147,"when i was around 19-20, i went to a party at my ex boyfriend's house. we dated when i was 15-17 and i don't think i'd seen him since we broke up. during the years we were broken up i lost some weight, colored/cut my hair, and was generally happier and more confident. i was sitting outside with my friend who dragged me there. ex came over and introduced himself, hand shake and all. i thought he was joking because we hadn't seen each other so i jokingly introduced myself back. he was like ""queenofknots!? omg! i didn't recognize you!""

164,"My ex-husband and I actually cheated on each other, and that right there should tell you how immature and incompatible we were for one another.  We married *way* too young.  I was 19 and he was 20.  The only reason we got married to begin with was because I had joined the military and we didn't want to be apart.  But we had many fundamental differences in our upbringings that we simply pretended that we could ignore.  We had problems with communication, dead bedroom, distribution of housework, finances, you name it.  We were just an incompatible couple. We saw a marriage counselor, but it didn't help. 

To make a long story short, he cheated, I cheated, but when he found out, he was *angry*.  He screamed at me and put his fist through the wall in our apartment.  Then he told me about his own infidelity and immediately went to call her.  I wasn't upset at all about his indiscretion.  I was not in love with him anymore, although I was ashamed of the way our marriage was ending and I felt like a loser.  We did end up parting ways on good terms, however.

Moral of the story: don't get married for convenience.

165,"I was dumped for being ""too fat for him"".

Saw him about a year and a half later, in the best shape of my life (I was killing it, looked like Gwen Stefani in her prime). I was sitting on a motorcycle looking super hot after a nice, mud flinging ride, and with a group of my attractive guy friends. 

He walked by with his gf (who was bigger than I had ever been) and I could totally tell he was taken by me. She could tell too... yikes. The best part was that I had actually gotten over him by this point, not really any sadness or anger, just ... why would I bother talking to him? He was not a nice person to me before so I couldn't be bothered to care to do pleasantries or even acknowledgements. He tried to tell me how great I looked (what an uncool move to do in front of his GF, unbelievable) but I just kind of fake grinned at him and [did one of these looks until he caught my drift](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/1f/ea/44/1fea4423cec3d15dfda07b1146c85f57.gif) and he finally said, ""Well have a nice ride, good to see you"" and walked away with her. I gave her a friendly, 'i'm sorry your bf sucks' look and she kind of made a meek smile back like, 'ugg this is not fun'.

182,"As far as the millennial thing, my grandfather(90) has said similar about my dad's (60) generation. 

I rrreeeaaalllllyyyy don't think what you're seeing is a millennial specific thing. As you get older and gain more experience you will continue to see this trait in fresh out of college people. There will be variation obviously, but what you're describing doesn't sound odd to me.

You described a situation where a person is given something new that they don't have experience with and must make decisions and take action on right? They're probably just newbs with that stuff or haven't had the opportunity to gain good experience. Old people not being able to adapt to technology, fresh recruits being thrown on the frontline, recent grads getting a job, etc etc. Those are all situations where you'll see the newbs doing stupid shit or making what seem to you, an experienced person, dumb decisions. And they probably *are* dumb decisions more likely than not, but it's not because of some generational thing.

Edit: also, as a side note, I would say that you normally *should* be crystal clear with what you want and expect. When working with experienced people their experience can help them interpret what you want, but that's lazy. Perhaps I'm misinterpreting what you're describing, but generally if you're deciding goals, direction, yadda yadda for a group, you need to paint that shit with detail. or if the decisions you are having to make are too big for you to go into detail on, then you need to delegate people to manage more directly that you know will be able to carry out your vision. or you need to teach these new people how to inform you so to make those decisions.

I am a conventionally attractive, skinny woman with blonde hair, blue eyes, and who cares a lot about my looks.  I love fashion and I wear makeup daily. 

For some reason my appearance causes many people (mostly men) to make immediate assumptions about my career and interests. In the past when telling people that I am a computer scientist, I've heard ""But you don't look like you do CS"" or ""But you're too pretty to be in tech."" I've also had men straight up laugh at me when I said I study Cs, thinking it was a joke or that I was lying. "

When it was done he let the water out and ran the towel over me and then carried me back to bed.

Something about that experience has really gotten to me. It's a feeling that I usually only get after we have really close sex. Really, I felt closer to him while he was cleaning grime off my skin and running a towel over me than I think I ever have before.

He didn't realize that I was the one running things/doing the strategic planning for my boss. It felt *great*.

This person chose to park next to my car. On the driver's side. Every day. After a week of manually unlocking one door and climbing in thru the passenger side, I stopped parking there. Fuck the customers. I parked as close to the front door as possible from then on. 

In retrospect, it could've just been someone else who worked at the mall that got some satisfaction from parking next to the same car every day and didn't think anything of it. But I'll never take that chance. "

210,"I feel this on such a deep level. 

I'm Lebanese, and my whole mom's side of the family (the one we were really close to growing up) has olive skin tone and gets really dark, really fast. I'm super white with sensitive skin that burns easily.

Well in summer 2014, my family and I were in California for a wedding. Me and two other cousins decide to go to the beach the day before the wedding, since we weren't part of the wedding party and didn't have anything to do all day while everyone else was busy. They pull out this tanning oil that's visibly helped them get darker, explaining that it's super effective and won't make you burn at all, so naturally I spread a fuckton of it on my poor skin. We sit on the beach and I'm fast asleep, only waking up a while later because it was time to get ready for the rehearsal dinner.

I was BURNT. Like, my red bikini looked like a full bodysuit, burnt. Taking a shower was torture; I couldn't touch any part of my body, I was radiating heat, and I'm pretty sure I had a fever. I managed to pull myself together, got dressed, did my hair and makeup, and was ready to go. We got to the restaurant, I ate, and then exhaustion hit my like a train. I was so out of it, I don't remember a single conversation I had. All I remember is one of my other cousins accidentally five-starring my burnt arm and being so engulfed in pain I instantly started bawling. Couldn't even help it. I went straight back to my hotel and cried myself to sleep that night.

I have a very deep fear of developing skin cancer when I'm older, and since seeing a dermatologist, have been wearing sunscreen religiously. It's been three years since I burned so badly, but I swore on my life that I wouldn't do that to myself again."

218,"My BFF was hanging out a few weeks ago and was telling me this story: He'd gone to a party hosted by his nephew, who is an attorney. All of the nephew's friends are attorneys. Now, perhaps it's an ugly stereotype, but in my experience, most lawyers drink like fish. This group is no exception. It was a private party at the home of some lawyer friends, catered by a restaurant that was chosen because one of the lawyer's wives works there. 

Fast forward to about an hour into the party and two of the people there, who are both veteran hard-core drinkers (a man and a woman -- who weren't together) are stumbling around, slurring their speech, puking all over the place. The woman, who is married to an attorney and who is also an attorney herself (and she plans to run for a local office someday), was incoherent, laying on the ground with her skirt hiked up around her waist. This woman is super modest and classy and would never, ever act that way, no matter how drunk she was. Both of those people left the party in an ambulance. The woman and her husband refused the tox screen because she was afraid that would tank her future political career. Putting two and two together, it was clear that someone tending bar thought it would be funny to dose some shots. Everyone who did the shots got incredibly sick. 

These are grown-ass adults in their early 30s at a private home of some wealthy, privileged people. That makes me nervous when you can't even trust the bar at a party like that. 

Moral of the story: Watch your shots being poured. "
219,"I'll try to keep this short but it's always creeped me out and I think it ties into the question.
One night I was sitting on my front porch replanting &amp; watering some of my flowers. My boyfriend worked nights so I was home alone. I noticed 2 guys walking towards me but was hoping they'd keep walking. Then I noticed they were walking towards me. For some reason, I immediately got this sinking feeling. I wanted to run back inside, but I played it cool &amp; didn't want to give away the fact I was home alone. 
So they came up to me &amp; complimented my flowers, &amp; was making small talk. Then one the guys said, ""yeah, I see you out here all the time and it's destiny that we finally got to meet."" They started walking closer to me at this point. The only thing I could think of to do was yell inside (my storm door was open) and say ""hey dad, are you ready to go pick up the pizza?"" And they walked away &amp; I went back inside.
So my answer to the question, is never assume you're safe. Even if you're on your own front porch. You always have to be aware of your surroundings &amp; always listen to your gut instinct. So after that, I'm constantly on the lookout for anything weird, &amp; have a plan in the back of my mind in case things go sideways."

I've never met a guy who cared when I've told him I have a boyfriend but they tend to back off when I tell them I'm married. Plus, I know it's stupid, but I feel a little more special and confident in our relationship. I like being introduced as his wife rather than his girlfriend...oh and I also like being covered on his health insurance lol "
240,"Not a hairdresser but I did ask mine recently what she recommended since I no longer was fighting flakes. She recommended the TRESemme ""Botanique Nourish and Replenish, Shampoo and Conditioner"" in the coconut scent. It's pretty good in my opinion &amp; has good ratings on Amazon so there's that. She also said never use the Dollar Store shampoos like V05 and they need to be sulfate free."
241,"This describes two women I know. Neither were baby-crazy, both had difficult pregnancies. 

My best friend described herself as ""neutral"" when her son was born. He was not unwanted, or unloved, she just...wasn't sure. But she says that over his first two weeks of life, she just fell in love with him. Like falling in love with her husband, but...deeper and differently? She's an incredible mom.

My other friend of a friend ended up leaving her partner with the kid because she legitimately did not want to be a parent, but he didn't want to terminate. She was 18, he was 42. Her ex-bf got married, the kid lives with the dad 90% of the time, and 2 weeks with her during the summer. She pays a lot in child support, but she says it makes sense, she feels more like an aunt than a parent. The kid calls the step-mom ""mom"" and calls her by her first name. "

243,"Honestly men don't get complimented on their looks as often, but on the flip side we don't have our entire worth based on it either. "
244,"I wasn't even aware I did this until someone pointed it out, but if I'm flirting with a man I'll stand a lot closer than I usually would, and I won't back off if we make eye contact. Apparently I also stop swearing and dial down the scouseness by about 20%, but that sounds like bullshit to me."
245,"My dad taught me that women were inherently emotional, and therefore we are weak and useless. Literally in those words. So that's why I tried to disprove him by suppressing all of mine (in fact it wasn't even to disprove him, it was just so he would love me as much as my brother). It led to 10 years of severe alcoholism and eating disorders which nearly killed me. I was prepared to die instead of admit that I was weak and useless. 

But, I'm unlearning that now. That's how I know how much courage it takes to feel. "
246,"I realised I was doing this, and vowed to stop. Unfortunately, I then went through a phase where I was unnecessarily rude to women I found attractive. I eventually learned to just chill and be helpful regardless of looks."
247,"I've found that women are usually just as likely as men to assume that emotional labor will be handled by women. I see this a lot in my workplace; I'm on the fun committee at my office, which is already almost entirely women, and the women that are in charge of coordinating most of our activities almost exclusively reach out to other women to join, participate in planning meetings, or help with prepping the activities we've planned.  

I also see it a lot with my friend group. We'll all come up with an idea for something we want to do together, then the women delegate parts of the planning/coordination to each other without ever considering roping some of the guys in.  

Another example: I have been expected (along with my other female relatives) to help clean up after Thanksgiving dinner every year since I was old enough to wash a dish. I can't think of a single time any of my male relatives have even been *asked* to help, let alone expected to do so. The one time I tried to get out of it by joining the men on the couch to watch football, I was seriously scolded by both my grandmother and my mom for not helping out. When the men were sitting and snoring and gabbing away ***right next to me***."
248,"Proper skincare. A while ago, I was talking to my boyfriend at the time, and he said that his beard was too wiry. I asked him if he washed it, and he said that he shampoos it regularly, but doesn't condition it. I said, ""Well there's your problem! That's like washing your face and not moisturizing!"" He said, ""Um, I do that every day."" I offered to buy him some moisturizer, but he declined. "
249,"I read a comment on a Reddit thread about a girl who used very fine sandpaper to buff away her leg hair.

250,"There was a guy who knew I liked horse racing, so he told me that his family owned a son of Secretariat at their farm in Texas and he had a stud fee of $1 million.  That might sound impressive to someone who *doesn't* know about horse racing, but it's kind of like saying that you have a 2015 VW Beetle made in Hawaii and it sells for $1 million.  

The funny thing is that he offered to take me to see the horse, so I wonder what would have happened if I'd taken him up on it."

253,Because they are taught in many social interactions throughout your life (it starts in kindergarten when we learn sharing is caring and it grows from there) and the majority of people seem to learn/develop them just fine and as humans we tend to assume the things that the majority learn or develop and something easy enough for that many people to learn. Societies depend so much on social skills and customs. It's literally the foundation of how culture works. Something so formative is treated as obvious because it informs pretty much everything about our lives. 
254,"if i go longer than two days, i feel like a disgusting mess because my hair gets oily and gross and theres no oomph. =/ i know people say wait longer, let your hair get used to not being washed, but i work in a professional setting, so theres very little opportunity for me to wait on those results...

Sorry my way isn't super helpful to you. :-/ "
258,"Learning to say no. I'm pretty far down on the chain, and a lot of people will come to me with tasks/jobs/projects/requests. I had to figure out at some point that I was allowed to say no sometimes. 

I have figured out that ""I'm pretty swamped right now, how soon would you need that done?"" works well. Or ""I can definitely do that, but I won't be able to get to it until Wednesday."" Also even ""that's not something I'm fully comfortable with, it looks like it's something that Directors generally do."" is an option sometimes!"

263,How important it is to read what people want out of a conversation. Sometimes someone wants support. Sometimes someone wants an ear to listen. Sometimes someone wants advice. Sometimes someone just wants to laugh. It's important to be able to tell what they want and try to give that to them.
264,"Sometimes I feel panicky and trapped when I feel like I ""have to"" have sex. Like anniversaries or weekend trips. It's dumb because I want to have sex on those occasions, but part of my brain hates that I'm expected to. I feel like I am obligated to say yes to sex and what if in the moment I want to say no? 

I know I can always say no. My partner is so nice. This is all internal. "

He and I just got along so well but by the time the guy I was with broke up with me, the other guy was already in a relationship. Then by the time she and him broke up, I was with somebody new.  I am pretty shy, but I know how to read people.  He and I were nearly inseparable in our early college years, and I was confident if I left my long-distance SO that he and I would get together.  I thought about it several times. Now he is with my best friend and they are getting married and they are honestly perfect together.  I've never told her because it's not important information.  Nothing ever happened between us, the stars never aligned, and now I know why.  When they started dating, I was friends with both of them, but clearly better friends with him.  She and I reconnected after she moved back and became best friends.  She's also the only one of my friends who's ever come to visit me in California.  I adore her and joke sometimes that if he ever fucks it up, I'm going to sweep her off her feet."

283,"Balance. It's tempting to either totally let yourself sink into your sadness or to push it all down and get on with your life. You need both. You need to have days where you do nothing but sit on the couch and eat chocolate and cry, and you also need to have days where you haul yourself out of the house and do something fun. Let yourself feel all your emotions, and also know when getting up and doing something will make you feel better.

Reach out to your friends. One of the biggest things I realized after my breakup was that I have so many more wonderful people in my life than I ever thought. You need your close friends, who you can talk to and cry with, and then you need your other friends, who you can have some normal time with and not think about how sad you are.

After a breakup, it can feel like the best part of your life is gone. The more you keep just doing things and talking to people, the more you'll realize your life is full of other great things too, more than you ever noticed before. Everything will still hurt for awhile, but it does get easier.

I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stash the chandelier."
286,"I get why some people say them. I think the intent of the comment is to let the recipient know that they are special and unique, and there isn't anything wrong with that. 

It just can come off something completely different than that, like the recipient is some kind of unicorn for possessing a basic quality that lots of women have, and isn't something inherently special. It sounds like putting down women as a whole, in the way ""you're pretty for [insert racial minority here]"" is. It's trying to be a compliment, but it isn't. And how special, how much of a compliment is it really when the message is, ""girls suck and lack basic things that make people cool, but you've got that""? When the bar is so low, clearing it isn't really a *good* thing, it's just that you don't quite suck as much as the rest of the class to which you belong. 

You can lift someone up or compliment someone without putting others down, and it just sends a much better message. There's no point, and no need, to compare a person in order to make them feel special/appreciated/complimented/what-have-you. Because compliments shouldn't be relative."

Vs the ones we do spot which are like 
""Tell her she's pretty for a fat girl. Pretend to forget your wallet to test if she's actually interested."" "
293,"Do things that make them uncomfortable because they've been taught to never be rude. This ranges from tiny things, like just accepting an old man's elbow in your ribs for an entire plane flight because it would be rude to ask him to keep his arm on his side of the arm rest, to big things like not removing yourself from an unsafe situation you want to leave because you might hurt somebody's feelings by letting them know you're not having a good time.

Never just saying no, which is rude and unladylike, and saying more socially acceptable things instead like, ""Well, maybe,"" or, ""I'm not sure,"" when what you mean is no."

302,"In retrospect it is totally funny and as an adult I laugh at myself, every picture I see from back then is a gift"
303,"I have always been a little weirded out by what happened to all the kids who picked on me in school. Because seriously, they're all dead. All of them. 

The girl who tormented me in high school died a few years after graduation in an ATV accident, which is of and in itself not that unusual up here.  But the boy who picked on me on the school bus 5th to 10th grade was crushed to death shortly after swapping schools. And the kid who tried to get me suspended twice because they didn't like what we published in the school paper OD'd her Freshman year of college. Another kid that tried to get me to give him the answers to math homework and spent all year calling me egghead and other unkind things died in a hunting accident. And the girl who bullied me in middle school died in high school, in a drunk driving accident. The guy who picked on me in middle school - he broke my science project - was highmarking on a mountain in high school and he also died. 

Seriously, it was like our grade was cursed. We lost other kids who were supposed to graduate with us, too, including one that was murdered, and more shortly after graduation. My sisters, who were in classes below mine, said people still talked about how absolutely awkward and long the memorial slides at our graduation were, even five years later. There were like 20 people missing from our graduating class, including one who died a week before graduation, and one who died on the way to graduation, and we weren't exactly a huge class. We started with over 300 students, Freshman year, and between deaths and drop-outs, at graduation there were literally less than 100 students remaining in the class. 

If I found out in 10 years there was a party on an Indian graveyard or something that most of the class went to and I being a total dork wasn't invited to and somehow a large portion of my class had offended evil spirits who then sought revenge, I mean, it would make way too much sense. Or like, if they pissed off a gypsy queen or voodoo lady, or I don't know, opened a mummy's tomb. Desecrated sacred lands. I don't even know. I just know none of the kids who picked on me survived to graduate college."
304,"In my 20's I was a really lost, abused and confused woman. I left home at 16 because my mother was abusive. I went to live with my then 21 yr old boyfriend and his family. A year later, we had our own apartment and the abuse started. He would lock me in the apartment. He would take away my computer cables so I couldn't talk to anyone outside. I couldn't work and if I did, I had to hand over my paychecks. I couldn't dress how I wanted. Wearing make up would make him call me a clown and make me take it off or he wouldn't be seen with me.  
  
  
By the time I was 19, I had enough. I didn't know how to leave because I had no family or friends. I had no money. I was just a desperate kid. My then boyfriend's best friend started hitting on me and promised me a way out. I took it.  
  
It didn't lead anywhere. Two days after I left my house and we slept in his car (what 19 yr old has more than 24 hr plans?) he said he couldn't help me anymore because his family threatened to cut him off.  
  
I went crawling back to my ex. The situation was now worse. I had to beg for forgiveness and prove myself. Eventually things were back to normal but now he wanted to get married. He also wanted me to have his baby and sign over my parental rights only to him. I wanted to die.   
  
When I was 23, I met a guy while playing an online game. As it turns out, he lived in the building next to mine. We talked for months and I opened up to him about my situation. We met up a few times and he wanted to help me. One day, I waited for my boyfriend to go to work and I packed 2 trash bags of clothing and left. I didn't look back.  
  
It didn't work out with that guy but he did release me from my hell. He was a good guy with a lot of mental health issues that I could not handle at 23. He needed and did not have access to mental health professionals. He was going through severe panic attacks that would cause him to hurt himself and others around him. He would scream and try to hit me. I went from one abusive type to another. I felt I was going insane.  
  
At least with him, I could work. So work I did. I spent as much time out of the apartment and away from him as I could. Unfortunately where I was living, a part time job at Best Buy will not pay for car, rent and food. I was stuck living with a mentally ill man. Great.  
  
I had a friend who I had known on and off for 6 yrs and I was honest about my situation. He was very sweet and kind and offered to help. He said I could move to his city where him and his friend were getting an apartment and I was welcomed to join.  
  
Somehow, I fell in love with him. We started dating long distance for a bit then I made the move.  Except his best friend backed out and we ended up having to live in his bedroom at his parents house for 2 years. It wasn't easy but I was free...  
  
I was 25 and living with him. His family was putting a ton of pressure for us to get married because we were living in sin. I also felt the pressure to get married because I was 'getting old' and my mom refused to come to my wedding if I didn't do it then. So, we got married in a small, family only non religious ceremony. We were ok. I wasn't extremely happy by this point because we had a lot of communication issues.  
  
He was not a bad man, at all. He was great. Responsible, soft spoken and intelligent.... He just wasn't emotionally available. I had to beg for affection. A hug and a kiss were like pulling teeth. My emotional needs were not met in any way and no amount of talking made it change.  
  
After 2 years, all the love I had just died. I was tired of feeling alone. We opened up our relationship and I went online to talk to women. I had no intentions of meeting another man. I really just wanted to explore my sexuality with my husband's approval. It went well.  
  
Then I met a man. He was not someone I was looking for. I actually didn't like him at all at first and asked him to stop contacting me. He was so persistent that eventually we started joking around and talking. After a few weeks of that, he asked me to call him. It was 2am and I was home alone. We ended up talking and laughing until 7am when I had to leave for work.   
  
I fell in love with him like I had never felt before. He knew I was married. He knew my husband and I hardly talked and hadn't had a sex life in months. He was aware. He never wanted to interfere. He was just there for me to vent to and he'd cheer me up. Eventually, we met in person and I suddenly understood love at first sight... But even then, we never kissed, we never touched. I was married. We both respected that to a certain point.  
  
We did have sexual conversations over text and that was wrong of me. I admit it. I shouldn't have done anything until I had divorced or at least talked to my husband... Its done now so I cannot fix it. My husband was suspicious and went through my phone. He found a conversation where I was complaining about how unhappy I was. It was so hurtful to him. He woke me up crying and I was so upset at how much I had hurt him. The thing is, I honestly thought he wouldn't care. I mean, why would he? He didn't care about my emotional needs and ignored me day in and day out. I thought he was bored and done with our relationship too! I would send him off to meet other women to see if he'd leave me.  
  
We tried to make it work. I cut off contact with this man and he understood. We said goodbye but my husband was so hurt, he didn't believe it. He did not trust me at all and began trying to track my every movement. He questioned everything I did and said. I do not blame him.  
  
I just didn't have the energy to continue to try and fix our broken relationship. I called it quits.   
  
I moved in with the new man in my life about 5 months later when my lease was finished with my husband. We signed the divorce papers almost 2 yrs later. It wasn't too messy. It was civil and polite.  
  
I'm now 31 and I've been in this relationship for 4 yrs almost. I have had a tough time trying to be happy in my life but I think I am finally ok. Our relationship is solid despite our shitty beginning. He is my best friend and my world. It may have been a shitty road to get here and it sure as hell wasn't orthodox but it worked out alright. My ex husband seems to be happy and I hope his new girlfriend /wife is a better match for him than I was.  
  
I do feel guilt that I jumped from one sinking ship to another but sometimes there are no other ways. I never set out to hurt anyone intentionally, I was just immature and desperate. I am lucky I didn't meet a predator who wanted to take advantage of me. I could be laying dead in a ditch somewhere because of my desperation."

306,"Plus, the stigma is worse for women, imo. Like, what if he thinks I'm a slut? What if he kills me *because* he thinks I'm a slut? What if he rapes and kills me and leaves my mutilated  corpse somewhere remote and my family doesn't get closure because he thinks I'm a slut?"
307,"The author of the book said that this is exactly what she wanted the book to feel like.

313,"I think sometimes it can be hard to separate a sexist character in a medium versus an actually sexist show/movie/book/videogame. But comedy particularly suffers from this I think because sexism in characters is often played as humourous, rather than offensive. So many TV sitcoms have this problem.

How I Met Your Mother comes to mind. Barney is a main character and his womanising antics are played for laughs, despite often being highly deceptive, manipulative and demeaning for the women involved. And so many women featured there just fall for these antics and into the dumb girl trope. His friends may groan at his stories but no one really calls him out on his horrible behaviour.

The Big Bang Theory is also pretty sexist though I think has possibly gotten better with it as the seasons have passed and the female characters are much more fleshed out. But I mean at the beginning, Penny is literally written to be the dumb blonde character and is a source of ridicule for her naivety (wanting to be an 'actress'). Bernadette and Amy are supposed to be scientists, but are nowhere near given the treatment the male characters in clever jokes and are expected to put up with the childish behaviour of the men. Howard is a particularly terrible character who is insanely sexist at the beginning and then becomes a terrible boyfriend/husband who expects his wife to clean up and look after the house and care for the baby (despite both working what look like full time jobs in academia!). There's an episode where he feels 'emasculated' because his wife makes more money than him but she's expected to sympathise rather than tell him to stop being a sexist idiot. Plus there is literally an episode where they address the lack of women in STEM whilst the female characters go to Disneyland and dress up as princesses. :/ Literally all the relationships in the show are incredibly unhealthy, flawed and exhibit considerably weird power dynamics but there's often really easy resolutions at the end of an episode. A relationship problem occurs and rather than addressing any underlying issues (or the fact these things come up all the time) they resolve it usually by making up at the end, saying I love you and giving each other a kiss."
314,"I used nair on my unibrow as a teen, and spent a week wearing a toque really low over my eyes at school to cover it. We had a no hats policy and my teacher asked why I was wearing a hat. When I flipped up the brim wordlessly he just said ""oh."" and walked away bewildered.

I tried using one of those home wax strip kits on my pubes. I applied one strip, ripped SUPER hard, and it was horrendous. Nothing came off and the wax was stuck in the hairs and wouldn't come off, even with the wax remover included in the kit. 

I tried an avocado, egg, and lemon hair mask once. On it's own, not so bad, BUT I was also in a no 'poo phase and washed it out with just water. I have a habit of going out with wet hair, so I went to class right after doing the hair mask. Halfway through class I thought ""damn, my hair isn't dry yet"". When I got home I looked in the mirror and I looked like I had poured a bottle of oil over my head. It was soooooo greasy. Thank god I only had one class that day."
315,"I've been broken up with a few different times. Signs have included but have not been limited to:

- Constant excuses not to hang out.

- Stopped inviting me to parties with him or to hang out with his friends.

- Lack of sex or distracted during sex.

- A sudden need for ""space"".

- A drastic drop in compliments and other verbal affections.

- Noticed him subtly flirting with other girls.

- Hiding his phone from me.

- Not being interested in what I'm saying.

- Saying everything is fine but not giving any explanation for any of the aforementioned changes in the relationship.

Usually when these signs would appear, the break up would happen within days."

322,"I had a bit of a cute one once. Young guy (15ish) was trying to pick me up when I was 16 and working in retail. I was piercing his ear for him and he was chattering. He told me about where he lived, and I recognised it as the local mental health hospital. I enquired about the hospital and he seemed a little surprised I knew it. He tried to tell me he didn't *live* there per se, he *worked* there, seeing the patients. It was a blatant lie but I felt kind of sorry for him. He must have lifelong mental health issues to live there and had to spend his days trying to hide that.  But he was the bravest and most bold guy I've ever had try to pick me up in front of his worker and my colleagues. "
323,"Yes. This also applies to parents who post everything about their young children's lives online now. Like, from birth onward, everything about their kids lives' is posted on social media for the world to see.  It seems wrong to me; the kids aren't old enough to have a choice in the matter. "

326,"I can sympathize with this so much! I am also blonde, blue-eyed, and I'm a bodybuilding competitor who is a software developer. 

A few weeks ago, I went to interview for a Senior Developer/Team Manager role. The interviewer took one look at me, sputtered, shifted his papers around, and ended up interviewing me for a Junior Developer position. When I told him that I was under the impression that I was interviewing for a senior role, he told me that he was interviewing me for the role that I was qualified for. When I gave him my actual qualifications and asked to be interviewed for the more advanced position, he did not believe that I was telling the truth about my work history.

All I can say is, keep your head up! Not everyone in the field has that outlook. Things like that will happen, but those incidents are few and far between."
327,"The amount of effort women put in their look. So much that when a guy says a woman ""let go of herself"" that usually means she puts half the effort she used to do and that's still at least x2 more than the effort guy puts on himself. I remember once my uncle told me how his wife wasn't taking care of herself much anymore and by that he meant she was no longer wearing dresses at home but either shorts or sweatpants, not putting on make-up except for special occasions and gained some weight. She was still dying her hair, still removing her body hair (at least her armpit and legs in summer, which I could see), still using a moisturizer. In the meantime my uncle is quite hairy and not once removed his body hair, never dyed his hair, not use a moisturizer, had a little belly fat as long as I have known him, and always wore comfortable sweatpants at home."
328," I'm only on episode 2 but I thought both eps tried to jam a lot into the narrative, but the endings more than made up for it. Sometimes I feel like Elisabeth Moss is overacting but then I'm like how together would I be in a dystopia where I am forced to procreate? Samira Wiley got the hands down best scene and she killed it; in general the presence of POC throughout adds another layer of horror to the story as I think white readers may be tempted to read the novel as an imagined future when in fact it's merely a retread of slavery past. Alexis Bledel is amazing and I'm proud of Rory Gilmore. I didn't like the casting of the commander and Serena Joy; they're too young and hot. They should look like Bill O'Reilly and Ann Coulter."
329,"That men ""just don't understand"" what women go through, or why they'd be feminists until they have daughters. That's bullshit, and it's mostly because men aren't taught to empathize with women, or think it's not important to believe women. "
330,"I recently posted about my awesome workplace and my sympathetic (male) boss.

Our CEO is very much in the ""we give you sick days, please don't come in with the flu and infect the office"" camp, and overall pretty chill about people working from home if they need to.

I have PCOS and get horrendous cramps, for the most part I can push through with some strong painkillers, but every so often I get them really bad. One morning I threw up so messaged my boss and told him I'd be working from home and why, he replied something along the lines of ""No working, couch, hot water bottle and Netflix, feel free to take tomorrow off too, let me know if you need anything"".

He also supplies the women's toilet with pads, tampons etc out of his own pocket. He's the best."
331,"I'm honestly not sure;Is a day by day thing. It took me a long time to realize the relationship should have just...never happened. We started dating when I was 16, a year after my dad died(Am 29, now). My mom started drinking and doing cocaine, was abusive;I was in a very bad place and being bipolar II wasn't helping the situation. It was a vulnerable time for me and he exploited that completely.

I found out much much later that he actually used to like, gather with our mutual male friends and plan how to 'get me' and would posture and bully any guy I showed interest in when I wasn't around. He called this the 'war room' even...like, fucking seriously. So many guys I was into would just randomly ghost me and this whole time I thought it was me, something wrong with me, but nope. He was 6'6 in high school and everyone was scared shitless of him so he had no trouble getting guys to step down when 'he called dibs'. 

He fucked with my head, manipulated me. My 'friends' helped him, in the time when I was most vulnerable and hurting from my family falling apart, from losing my dad. Eventually I just gave in because I was tired of him pressuring me, tired of my peers pressuring me. That and my mom was abusive and volatile from drug and alcohol abuse;I felt like I had nowhere to turn. I didn't have the understanding or maturity to handle the situation in a more reasonable manner at that age. 

The rape is a thing after all this time I still feel not so good about, even after therapy and all that. I found out he was actually totally into me cheating on him later, like, he had a huge cuckolding fetish...so why did he have to do that to me? I bled on and off for almost 2 weeks;I still have a line of knotted scar tissue. He stopped and asked me if it hurt, kept going. He had a over a foot on me and 80lbs, easily. That and he even admitted later he was, and still is in love with his best friend, a guy who would hang out at our house all day with him for practically *3 years.*

I will never give a shit that after that I stepped out on our marriage whenever I felt like it, and I'm never going to feel bad or sorry for it. Sorry for the wall of text;It's been a week, yo. "
332,"Cry if you need to, block them on social media (because seeing what they're up to hurts a lot and you don't need that), talk to friends and do things that make you feel good; whether it's working on yourself or being with friends, just do it!

And once you get to the stage where you're angry: write a list of things that made you angry during your relationship. When my ex broke up with me, I was sad at first and then, I got really angry because of the circumstances of the breakup. When I wrote the list, I realised how angry he'd made me and how many times he treated me and my feelings with no respect. It's helped me a lot to feel better about it all and I no longer think about all the shitty things he did because I've written them down. "
333,"Ugh, this constantly happens to me on my commute. It makes me feel better to know other men notice. "
334,"That they're somehow more sexual than women, and that somehow makes them less capable of controlling their actions.  I'm sorry, but I have a hard time imagining *anyone* thinking about sex more than I do, and I have no trouble with being faithful,  behaving appropriately with my peers, and treating people with respect.  If you can't, then sex isn't your problem.  "

338,Wow. Using safety measures to also be nicer to people in the community? You're awesome. :)
339,Or they're socially awkward nerds
340,"I have a lot of hair, and I've had it for a long time. I've seen a *lot* of different hairdressers. So far the only advice that's worked for me is: **whatever works for your hair.**

I know that's disappointing advice, but it's true. What works for someone's hair might not work for another persons.  It also depends on what you want the outcome to be. Certain conditioners make my hair baby-soft but limp. Others take out all the tangles, but don't do much else. "
341,I quite like shells!
342,"If you ever are alone with someone I.e. in an elevator, or feel like they're walking in the same direction, you should look them in the eye. My uncle worked with rape victims in the air force and he said something so simple is a big deterrent because criminals want someone that looks like an easy target that won't recognize them. Simply looking them in the eye with confidence to let them know you could ID them if needed is all it takes. "
343,"I worked in clubs and bars for years, and I always touch people when I'm walking through crowded areas. It's for the same reason you said, to let them know someone is behind them. People (especially drunk people) are unpredictable, and I don't want them suddenly backing up or turning around and knocking my drink out of my hand. Or, if they do those things, I've already got my hand out and can kind of push them back. I also use my words, but drunks don't listen.

That being said, the above poster is right. There are certain men who will move through the crowd and unnecessarily touch women, like on the small of the back, or the ass, or they'll turn sideways to squeeze by and oh, accidentally their crotch has to slide against your ass when dude, it's just really not that tight in here."
344,This sounds like the opening scene to a John Hughes or Tina Fey college rom com.  
345,Who's not taking their phone into the bathroom..?
346,That's horrifying. Are you okay now?
347,"&gt; I think that not enough men are aware that their drug, alcohol, and sex habits are hurting them emotionally by depriving them of real joy. 

Shoot, you don't even need to have bad habits in these regards. As a dude, you're almost *expected* to always want sex and never turn down an opportunity to drink... When you *don't* want one of those things, there's something wrong with you. "
348,"I'm really disgusted, and disappointed, and flip between being surprised but also not. My friend, who lives in New Hampshire, is *really* mad.

It saddens me to know that people like him truly believe the awful stuff they say. How can someone have that much hate for others? For people who have never done anything but merely exist? 

I usually assume that many TRPers are young guys looking for validation. It makes me hope that some will eventually get away from it and end up being good people. I know that there are older men there. Fathers, husbands, bosses, etc. And now we have proof that elected officials are a big part of it. 

"
349,I tweezed my eyebrows off like 7 years ago. It took FOREVER to grow them back. 
350,"This was me, but I was 17 and we were engaged. Too young to be enagaged and once I realized that, I was too cowardice to break up. But then again, anytime I did say anything about being unhappy he didn't handle it well _at all_ (imagine emotional breakdowns, threats, the whole shebang). Bad relationship, total regret about the whole thing. "
351,"And I wish that people would understand that this isn't even true about pizza. Pizza can get bad, you guys."
352,"Treating men of equal caliber and social position better than women in the same vicinity. 

As a professional woman who works with men in many different arenas of life, I can tell you that this is my number one frustration. I've had men doubt my abilities just from hearing a female lead's name as the project coordinator, or men who refuse to take my ideas seriously. Men who talk over me, constantly interrupt, dismiss my opinions until they ""prove"" it to themselves- none of this would happen if I was a dude.

Also, that thing where you see friends in public and no one bothers to introduce themselves to the woman you're with. Most men are socially graceful enough to be like, ""friend, this is desolatefugazzis"". But 70% of them don't, and you stand there awkwardly not knowing anyone's name, and feeling like a total hanger-on in conversations that you're a part of. 

Now i'm less afraid of being assertive and push my hand out and force them to introduce themselves... but goddamn if this isn't an active frustration every single fucking time. "
353,"I don't listen to music so I can hear sounds around me, like when someone walks up to me from behind. But I do keep my earphones in so I can ignore people when they talk to me (""oops can't hear you, even though the cable is connected to nothing!""). Whenever I'm in a train/bus/etc I will have my earphones in AND a book to read, to make sure I look unavailable to talk to. I never look men in the eye, because many of them think it's some kind of invitation to start talking to me. When I walk alone, I have my keys in between my fingers, somewhat like claws (where I live things like pepper spray are illegal), or I will light cigarettes, even when I'm not smoking them, just to have some sort of 'weapon' if needed. No heels, so I can run when needed. I let people know where I am and/or when I'm expected back. I have emergency number on speed  dial and my phone always touching my hand in my pocket. Or I will suddenly feel the need to call someone while walking somewhere, hopefully sending the message that 'someone knows where I am at the moment, so don't even try.'

When going out, always try to be in a corner, so I can see the entire room. Don't accept drinks from strangers, not just because they might put something in it, but also because I don't want to ""owe"" them anything. I usually wear a wedding ring, I notice it acts as a deterrent. I am married now, but I also did this when I wasn't. On top of that I don't like being drunk because I need to feel like I'm in control of situations.

Of course there are places I avoid because it makes me feel unsafe in general, but at night I will avoid anything that's not lit or heavily trafficked. I will avoid situations that are possibly dangerous whenever I can, for example, I will not walk into an elevator if the only other occupant is a man; I'll wait for the next one. I will call a cab rather than taking the subway at night. I will walk around an entire block even if it takes me 10 minutes longer. I do not open the door when I'm home alone; when someone comes to fix the toilet, take the meters, deliver a new washing machine, etc, I will make sure I""m not home alone.

Just to be clear, nothing (terribly) bad ever happened to me, and it might be because I'm so paranoid, lol. Also, most of this is not even done consciously, I've spent quite some time thinking about this before I typed it and I'm sure there are still other things I do that just don't occur to me at the moment.

Edit: a word and a terrible typo. :D

Edit 2: I just realized I made it seem like I'm some anti-social lunatic, so just to clarify: everything I described here is in situations where I'm out alone and just minding my business. Of course I look men in the eye when I'm socializing, but with randoms on the street I don't want to give them a reason to stop me and start talking. :P

354,"I never particularly wanted to be a mother when I was young. I never idealized motherhood and family and envisioned myself being single and having adventures. 

But I met this great guy and fell madly in love. And suddenly the idea of having a baby with him seemed like a pressing need, the greatest thing ever. I guess I was high on love hormones or something. So we got married and got me knocked up.

Pregnancy was 9 months of crushing low to mid grade constant misery. It sucked. I can't even describe how miserable it was. 9 months of it. Did I mention it sucked? Because it sucked.

But I was excited to get the kid the fuck out of me. I was excited to meet my son. I was really excited to be able to let his father hold him instead of having him crush my internal organs and strain my hips and push against my ribs.

And, while I don't think it was instant ooey-gooey love, there was an instant, fierce possessiveness. Think of a mamma bear with her cub. This is mine; I made it; it smells like me; mine; you can't have it! That eventually grew into ooey-gooey love. I mean, I'd still tear the face off of anyone that messed with my baby but I also melt a little inside whenever I look at him. He's ten now and I still feel that way about him.

I mean, I'm not having another kid unless my husband gets pregnant but I love the shit out of the kid I've got."

360,"My friends and I usually have signals for each other that mean we need help or extraction.  If someone is dancing or maybe even just chatting with a dude at a bar and he gets obnoxious and you want to get away but he keeps bothering you, you give a signal (itching your shoulder blade, for example - the exact signal has varied over time) and one of your other friends will run over and act like you need to leave immediately.  Similar text-based signals apply to new dating situations, where a certain text could trigger a friend to call you with a story about how they need you immediately for an emergency or whatever.  And, of course, a 911 text that would lead the friend to call 911 if things get that serious (thankfully never needed to use this!).  Most of the guys I've talked to don't pre-arrange signals to help them escape a sticky or annoying situation because, as some of them told me, ""I'd just walk away from it.""  Being able to just walk away and not be followed or feel harassed for it is really a huge privilege!  When you think a dude is going to keep harassing you and then he actually allows you to walk away without any incident, it's a huge relief and I literally feel privileged in that moment.  It's stupid that I need to feel that way at all though."

378,"Yes. I am in my mid-early 40's. when I was in my late teens/early twenties, guys were just thrilled that a girl was willing to get naked with them. 

Today, it seems like there is so much more pressure and objectification. Like, she has to shave, act like a porn star, and be willing to do sexual things that she may or may not like.

As a young adult, giving a blowjob wasn't a casual thing. Like, I might have allowed heavy petting, but oral sex was more like something you would do after becoming sexually active with someone. It wasn't part of third base. Also, anal sex wasn't just an expected thing. 

Another thing I'm glad I didn't have to deal with at that age is the constant request and expectation of nudes. I married at 18 and can remember when my husband wanted to take pics with a Polaroid. It was a very racy thing to do. Now, complete strangers expect or at least ask for nudes before asking for a date."
379,"the oversaturation of porn in our society isn't helping anybody. on top of the things you've listed here, young men are left with the expectation that if they don't have a 12 inch dick they can never satisfy a woman, that if they don't have ripped abs no girl will give them a second look. on top of generations of women who have these bizzare skewed views of sexuality from porn, we also have a generation of men who feel like they can never measure up. there are boys today who really believe that no woman will ever love them because they don't have a massive dick and are afraid that any girlfriend they have will leave them for the next ""hung hunk"" that comes their way. 

we have generations of women who have skewed and frankly creepy visions of sexuality and men who have absolutely no confidence in themselves and very little trust for women, thus unable to really form solid relationships. 

I like porn as much as the next hairy chested manly-man, it's part of my thrice daily ritual afterall XD but the oversaturation of sex and porn in our society has reached frankly ridiculous levels. 

ps: I hear what you're saying about the expectations some younger women have of what's expected sexually of them these days. while I like the more extreme and bizzare porn, in real sex I can do kinky stuff and roleplay, but frankly if I did half the stuff I jack off to in porn, I'd throw up and go cry in the shower like Tobias Funke.

380,"There's a product called [Smoothe Away Hair Removal Pads](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Dbeauty&amp;field-keywords=Smooth+away). I tried it once. I was pretty excited to try the ""revolutionary flex crystal exfoliating pads that gently remove hair without chemicals while leaving silky smooth skin"". Sounds awesome, right? 

That shits just straight up fucking sand paper."
381,"Checking out women. Ex. in a line. They turn around for whatever reason, and all of a sudden behind them is x10 more interesting then infront of them. Even if we're making eye contact. 

And that the whiplash like the movies is a real thing. "
382,"I hate it when men do this. It makes me very uncomfortable, especially because there are a shit ton of spots NOT in front of me that are comfortable to stand in...

I don't want to stare at someone's crotch.  It is not going to make me want their dick. It is only going to turn me right OFF. "
383,"For example, mine is not being an organ donor. I think that actively choosing to not put your dead body towards helping other people is off-puttingly selfish."
384,"It's also more comfortable for me to do that. Lots of things are more comfortable for me, like laying across four different seats. But I don't do it because we all get one seat as per the social contract so y'all need to suck it up and close your legs. "
385,"Disclaimer: my periods have never been super heavy, so YMMV.

I either wear a tampon to bed or, if i am in a pad mood, I'll ball up some toilet paper/kleenex and put it in the bottom of my butt crack. Keeps the flow from channeling back that way and getting off the pad."
386,"I'll probably get hated on for this but whatever. I cheated on my boyfriend of over a year to be with my current husband. I'm not proud of it, and I didn't drag it out (broke up with him immediately). We were long distance and the feelings had long since faded, but he didn't deserve that. We wouldn't have been compatible for much longer, but it's a shitty way to end things and not the best start to a new relationship. It was selfish, and it was stupid. That being said, my husband and I have a wonderful relationship and I can't imagine being with anyone else emotionally or physically. I don't have a sob story or anything other than indifference that led me to cheat. My advice? If you no longer have feelings for someone (and there's no way to work it out), break up with them before you do something you'll regret. "
387,"Homegirl you better put a ring on it, that's amazing"
388,"Holy christ yes. It's not just the complaining about minor grievances, which everyone does, but the genuine expectation (or is it hope?) of sympathy and attention in response. Maybe if you were five and I were your mom, dude."
389,"I was the kid who was so socially anxious he'd naturally gravitate as far away as possible from the most attractive girls anywhere.

I remember many times in class hoping and praying I didn't get paired with a crush, and feeling relieved when they called my name next to a homely girl."
390,"Semi-having this problem now. I'm an introvert and homebody, but I'm going *crazy* just sitting at home and watching Netflix. If I hear ""Want to watch (show) tonight?"" one more time...

There's a whole *world* out there. TV shows will always be waiting."
391,"Jim: ""Fact. Bears eat beets. Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.""

Dwight: ""IDENTITY THEFT IS NOT A JOKE JIM. MILLIONS OF FAMILIES SUFFER EVERY YEAR.""

Jim: ""...MICHAEL!""

"
392,"Yep. There was a recent thread elsewhere about how men never get complimented, and there was a whole lot of rationalization about how the answer couldn't possibly be, ""You look like shit, that's why"". Like they thought they should be awarded the prize for sexiness because they brushed their teeth and used deodorant. "
393,"This is really important for people to see. A lot of the response when women get into dangerous situations is ""why didn't you just tell him to fuck off?/ Did you ever actually tell him to leave you alone?/ Why didn't you just leave?"" and this is the answer. Because pissing them off is dangerous. "
394,"I did the same idiotic thing!!!!!! It was in 5th grade. The only way I could think to disguise the tuft was to wear one of those wide stretchy headbands right at the front of my hairline for like 8 months. Like never took it off. Awful, awful idea."
395,I bet OP wasn't ex-peg-ting that response.
396,"Stone cold badass. 

I know she's done some shit but damn if she isn't the most fascinating character to me."
