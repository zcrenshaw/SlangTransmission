0,"That my fiance will tell me on our wedding day that he's actually a prince of some tiny European nation, and after the wedding we'll be returning to his home so he can introduce me as the princess. And we'll have all the money we want, so we can both quit our shitty jobs.

You can blame this one on Disney too, OP. Also, Coming to America."
1,"I can't go to the gym without some dudebro taking my headphones out of my ears and trying to talk to me - annoying. But most uncomfortable was a couple months ago when I went to my university's gym for the first time. 

I like to do cardio, then a bit of weights and then cardio again - splitting my hour 15, 30 and 15. So I hop on the elliptical and I'm inputting a time limit and this guy comes up and turns it off. He's all smiley and tells me he'd be happy to show me how the machines work. I thank him, say no, and turn it back on so I can set the time limit. He turns it off *again* and insists he can show me. I ask him how he's supposed to show me if the machine is off. He just keeps smiling and starts talking about how he comes all the time and he's never seen me. I thank him for his offer, again, then put my headphones in. For the third time, he turned it off, so I told him to leave me alone and hopped off to go do weights. 

He followed me over to the leg press and every time I'd select a weight, he'd move the pin lower. I had my headphones in and couldn't hear him and was trying to ignore him, hoping he'd go away, but he kept pulling the pin out after I'd made my selection. I overcame the urge to round-house kick him in the face, I went and found a gym staff member who told the dude off. 

He watched me from across the room for the rest of my workout, so I left early. Haven't seen him since, but admittedly I've only been back a couple times cos he skeeved me out. "
2,"Hooked up with a coworker and he only liked the most vanilla sex imaginable. He hated if I wanted a faster pace, didn't want me to touch or kiss him at all once he was inside. He just wanted to put his penis inside me and let it marinate until he came. "
3,"My BF once did the whipped cream thing. He put it all over over his penis and even had a maraschino cherry on top like a sundae and he was splayed out in that ""paint me like one of your french girls"" pose on our bed when I got out of the shower.

I laughed and laughed. It was one of the funniest things I'd ever seen and completely unexpected.

He actually thought it might be sexy and was very hurt by my reaction. He hasn't done anything spontaneous or kinky since and doesn't want oral anymore either :( I think I may have underestimated or misjudged how guys feel about trying to be sexy."
4,"When I'd just started speaking to this guy from college. He did the whole ""i don't know why I'm single I guess I'm not hot enough"", I said ""Oh you're attractive though"" and he said ""yeah I'd love to stick my dick in you""

That's not what to say on the first conversation. "
5,fucking marinate lmao
6,"When some guys assume everything is done to attract men - like the thread we had yesterday where someone thought that if a woman is hitching up her jeans, she might be doing it to show off her ass instead of actually trying to *avoid* flashing her ass or underwear because her jeans are riding low. Or questioning why girls wear Ugg boots when guys *don't even find them sexy*, or why a girl is wearing a snug-fitting top in the gym if it isn't to show off her boobies to all the men (try doing sit-ups or press-ups in a baggy t-shirt, you'll flash your boobs far more than you do in a lycra top that stays put).

Obviously there genuinely are times when many women want men to think they look good, but some of the questions we get here really over-analyse the smallest actions and how an attractive woman can possibly continue being attractive while doing/saying/wearing normal everyday stuff if she isn't specifically out to be sexy at the time. "
7,"Back when I was a youngin, I was bent over my bed getting fucked by this dude who had an oddly shaped penis. It felt great but I didn't know yet that that position makes my vagina turn into a black hole of air that suddenly explodes at random. So as he is about to thrust back in, I queef. I started giggling, which then turned into an almost 10 minute nonstop queef. Dude got dressed and left my bedroom and waited for me in the living room, I just sat there queefing and laughing at myself the whole time. He broke up with me the next day but I didn't care because that was by far the most hilarious situation I've ever experienced."
8,"Wanted two kids. Was really scared of birth. Birth went exactly as my worst nightmare predicted. 

Initially I was really sad that I'd only get one baby (no way in hell I was going through another birth) and was looking into adoption for a second kid. 

Slowly began to realise that one kid is freaking hard work. My little girl is an angel. Sleeps well, never cries, breastfed easily,  eats food like a champion... but she's still hard work. 
I don't have the emotional capability to handle another kid. I struggle with this one! I like that can hand her to my husband and have some time off. He can leave her with me and it's not hard. 

He is the stay at home parent- I did it for 7 months while I recovered- bugger that. Parenting is hard. He does amazingly. He loves being at home with her, going to playgroup and swimming and all that baby stuff. But it's pretty intense and there is no break during the day. 

Sometimes I regret having her. She changed my world so much, and some activities are right off the books for quite a while. Knowing that your life will be different makes it easier. I was well aware that we'd not go on any overseas holidays for a while. We have no family nearby, so we have no one to baby sit. We are doing this baby thing on hard mode all alone. We've had one date in over a year.

For all of this, she's a pretty cool baby and it's neat watching her grow into a little person. 

That was pretty rambly, but it's hard to put into words. Basically,  it's super hard work. Sometimes it feels worth it, sometimes it doesn't.  Problem is once you start you can't give up. Unless you're a really shitty person I guess. And you don't know what sort of kid you will get until it is too late to back out. 



"
9,What. The. Actual. Fuck?
10,"Most of the guys who've harassed me have been conventionally attractive. Some of the worst offenders have been guys who get a lot of women, and have a sense of entitlement about them. They get very aggressive when I don't show any interest. "
11,"Letting his fetish be an every time expectation. 

When we first started dating, he told me he liked latex and shiny clothing and asked me if I'd wear it.   I was like ""sure, I don't care, I like you and I like feeling good with you so I don't care what I'm wearing to get there.""

But when there were times I didn't want to,  such as if it was just cold and I didn't want to take off my warm clothes to put on cold clothes and I would have really loved to just have under the covers pajama sex, suddenly we had a huge problem. 

He resented the fact that I was refusing to give him something he liked.   He asked why I would give him something (the expectation of every time shiny) just to ""take it away."" He felt that I was judging him for his fetish by sometimes not wanting to dress up. 

I resented the fact that I didn't have a choice.  I resented the fact that he could only enjoy me with the fetish clothing.  He would say ""I do love you but the clothing is just the icing on the cake."" But a cake without icing is a pretty shitty cake.   I want to be the icing.  I felt like I as a person was only second to the clothing.  He would say that was only my imagination but how could I not feel that way. 

The few times he eventually ""let"" me not dress shiny, it was a negative experience anyway knowing that he was only having a mediocre experience and the mutual resentment being an elephant in the room.       "
12,"I wouldn't say it damaged me, but my ex choked me until I passed out once and when I woke up, he was sitting on the floor crying. I wasn't upset with him, just a bit shaken up. I was the one who'd pressed this kind of bedroom vibe and I was the only person he'd ever slept with (didn't know that at the time -- he lied about it) so I genuinely don't think he knew what he was doing. It wasn't detrimental to the breakup but it did expose some serious miscommunication issues, and sexual incompatibility that really messed with his belief in his own manhood. I'm just glad he didn't kill me by accident. I was drunk and he was brand new to that kind of kink. Not a great combo."
13,"If you're doing something you feel like you need to hide or lie about, that's  probably not a good sign."
14,"I would love to reconcile with my ex. He would think 'I met many beautiful women, but you were always in the back of my mind.' I don't even have particular ex in mind, it's just my vanity.   "
15,"He cried hard when his dog died last summer. I held him, stroked his hair, and cried with him. Then I encouraged him to have a little memorial service since I read an article once about how pet deaths can be hard because we don't deem it as societally-acceptable to grieve for them, even if they feel like family. I didn't want him to bottle it up, so we had a little vigil where he told me stories about his dog and we honored her memory."
16,"I've met a lot of people who *claim* to be ""sociopaths"" but they're really just assholes.

I did meet one true sociopath when I was working at a mental hospital, though, although I only worked directly with him for one day when I was covering somebody else's shift.  He was an angelic-looking 13-year-old kid with mild intellectual disabilities.  He had kind of a class clown personality and loved any kind of attention, especially from attractive, sympathetic female staff members who doted on him.  He was extremely good at presenting himself as a good, earnest child who was the victim of bullying and mean parents.  But he wasn't quite high-functioning enough to keep up the act *all* the time.  He'd act out extremely violent fantasies with his toys, he'd randomly attack people who irritated him, and he'd threaten any woman who *didn't* fall for his sweet-little-boy act with rape or murder.  A lot of the kids at the hospital were violent, but they didn't really have the mental capacity to *plan* violence.  With this kid, it was all premeditated and there was often a sexual element.  He knew which staff members he hated, and he knew how to skirt the facility's rules.  We had to count his utensils after meals to make sure he didn't have anything that could be used as a weapon.  I heard from a coworker that he had a history of harming animals and sexually assaulting girls at his school.  Even his mother seemed to be afraid of him.  This was several years ago, so that kid is probably going to age out of the children's mental health care system soon..."
17,"Human beings can't read each other's minds.  If there's something you want your partner to know, you need to tell them.  Getting mad at someone for something you've never told them is just a way to make yourself miserable.

Not just about being in relationships with men, mind you."
18,"A few years ago, I went on a few dates with this older guy who was handsome, funny, good company, had a really cool career etc., but it swiftly became apparent that he was creepy and clingy as fuck. I dropped him after he threw a weapons-grade tantrum at me for being round my male friend's house watching tv, where he got so aggressive that I panicked and had to get my mother to pick me up. 

I got home to a barrage of Facebook messages calling me everything under the sun, at which point I told him to leave me alone or I was calling the police. 

Then a few days later I was walking home from town when I saw his van parked outside my house. I shit myself because he'd already spotted me and it was too late for me to turn around and walk away. As I approached my house, he got out of the van and was staring at me. It was very unnerving. 

As I got to my gate he sulkily shuffled over to me and said, ""So are we still on?""
""Uh, no,"" I said. ""Not after how you acted.""

He was genuinely put out and perplexed and got back in his van, driving off after saying, ""God, it's over just like that?!"" He was genuinely baffled as to why I wasn't just overlooking the fact that he was mental and aggressive and creepy. 

Once he got home then, he messaged me off another Facebook account telling me that he hoped I got fucked over by a ""rugby boy with a big cock"" who would ""use me up"" like the slut that I was. 

Top bloke. 🙄 "
19,Hahaha well at least you're no longer with a guy who can't count to three.
20,It'll be twenty years in June. So awesome?
21,"They hate each other.

They are constantly catty/competitive/passive aggressive with other women.

Never even remotely true in my personal, academic, or working life."
22,"I watched way too many Asian dramas growing up so I *really* wanted the rich, cold, unloved guy meets awkward, clumsy, hardworking girl and they fall in love thing. *sigh* goodbye dreams."
23,"I've actually initiated the breakups in pretty much all of my serious relationships. I hate to admit it, but these are some of the ways my behavior changed in the weeks preceding the breakups that would likely apply to others: 

* Seems more distracted then usual when they are in your presence/just doesn't want to actually spend any time with you when you're physically together. Is always on their phone or wearing headphones

* Sex is reluctant and becomes less and less frequent. When you do have it, it's clear they'd rather be anywhere else

* Generally does not initiate contact or seeing each other. Often reads text messages without replying, even if they are direct questions

* Avoids topics related to the future. Does not bring up these topics and attempts to change the subject when they arise

* Rarely says ""I love you"" first anymore, replies to this only when you are in person or on the phone

* Instead of becoming passionately angry during an argument, is mostly indifferent and cold

* Stops arguing/mentioning it when something bothers them altogether
"
24,"He said ""Is it too soon to say I love you?"" and I was like ""A little, yeah.""

And then a few days later I said, ""You know what? I love you too. This is crazy.""

That was like, a week into our relationship. We got married 6 months later."
25,"I was on acid and he was really drunk. After he put the condom on he could not for the life of him get it in. Like it took us both a good 8 minutes because he wouldn't fucking scoot back and he kept trying it at weird angles. Then when he finally got it in, he took one deep thrust, and then pulled out and said ""oh shit, I just got dizzy. I feel really lightheaded, I think I'm gonna go."" Then he grabbed his alcohol, put on his pants and left. And he never took the condom off either like what?? So I spent the rest of the night watching the ceiling move.    "
26,"We haven't experimented with it. But there's absolutely, no way I am able to share this man with another person in bed. That dick is mine. Period. Fantasize all you want, but at the end of the day, my heart only has room for one. 

Edit: I'm happy I have so many that agree."
27,"Not a current significant other, but I was in a long-term relationship when we decided to try polyamory. We had a couple threesomes and no harm seemed to come from it, so I guess we figured we'd try an open relationship. We established very concrete boundaries like if we ever felt like it wasn't working, we both had veto power to end the polyamory business. Well, he fell in love with a girl on the side while also being very possessive about who I could hook up with and ""not allowing"" me to be intimate with certain men. It turned into him dating another girl for 3 months, lying to me about her spending the night and other things, and then when I tried to exercise my veto to bail out of the polyamory thing gave me a clear ""no."" So it all crashed and burned and we broke up, but it's all good, I'm monogamous, married, and happy now :) "
28,That I cry to be manipulative. No I cry because I'm sad or otherwise overwhelmed with emotion. 
29,"Me too. Except I don't want any of them, I just want them to have wanted me for so long. And then I would crush their dreams like the Ice Queen I am."
30,"Being alone is better than having a shitty romantic partner, always. "
31,"Attention? Sort of. A lot of the attention though is negative and unwanted, and doesn't mean they want you or want to date you. It's harassing, sexist, objectifying stuff.

Dates? Not at all. 

Honestly, I think it seems that way on reddit because there are so many guys on here who get salty as fuck and act like a woman can step outside of her home and be flocked with men trying to get with her. "
32,"some guy came up to me and tried to sell me his personal training services. he did it by simultaneously complimenting and insulting my workout. he said things like ""your shoulder press is excellent. but let's be serious, your shoulders are pretty manly"" and ""great squat form. do you really think you should be squatting that much weight though?"" and also making a lot of assumptions about what i was trying to achieve (""you want to look like a victoria's secret model, i can help you,"" ""you don't want to be too muscular, you know"") and, on top of that, HITTING ON ME. i was...very uncomfortable. and at the time i was in college and making money as a bikini/lingerie model (not a fitness competitor) so i was muscular but pretty ""feminine"" (whatever) and goddammit i looked as much like a victoria's secret model as someone my height (5'7"") was ever going to look. "
33,"why isn't budding an option tho

""hey why do u have an arm growing out of ur arm""

""oh nbd just cloning myself""

""o ok"""
34,"It's a-me, the OP! I'll go first!

I've always deeply, deeply wished that a guy could fall in love with me at first sight. Blame Disney, blame romance novels, but there is something so romantic and sexy and fulfilling about the idea that a guy saw me across a room and was instantly smitten. 

However, I'm pretty unattractive. Should a boyfriend ever again appear on the scene (get your ""Ice Capades in Hell"" tickets now!), it's guaranteed I'd have won him over with my personality, *despite* my looks. So, it's an unrealistic expectation... but something I still wish were possible, deep down!"
35,"The assumption that women dress with the male gaze in mind. 

Nope, yoga pants are comfortable and I don't care about your weiner half as much as you do, bro.

Oh, and that penis size thing. 

And that telling a man ""no"" is ""playing hard to get"". No means no, you are not the exception to the rule, go away. "
36,"Seriously. There was this guy I met who was a D-list celebrity, extremely good-looking, tall, muscular, got women at the drop of a hat. 

He got so offended that I wasn't into him. The night ended with him yelling, ""FUCKING DYKE"" at me. That is the pinnacle of entitlement - woman isn't into me, so she *must* not be into men at all. "
37,:( Tell him he is sexy 
38,"I worked on an inpatient psychiatric unit and a man admitted himself complaining of depression and suicidal ideation.  The doctor suggested he was malingering, but I still had to do my job with him.  We talked about services he needed, and I provided him referrals and talked through his struggles.

He asked me first if I would call for him, and I said no, because he needed to demonstrate some willingness to help himself so it would reflect well on his progress notes.  Then he asked if he could use the phone in my office, and I told him he needed to use the client phone and where it was.  

At the moment, he had his face buried in his hands, and he had been a little weepy.  When I said no the second time, he lifted his face and looked me dead in the eye.  His tears had suddenly dried, his eyes went black with barely concealed rage and he bared his teeth at me.  He hissed that it was my job to help him and that I was obviously beneath him if I wouldn't help.

I quickly escorted him out of my office and into a common room.  After that I saw him giving weepy tirades to other sympathetic people, but every time he saw me, he would slyly and conspiratorially grin as though he was getting one over on them.  The doctor released him the following day after I told what I saw and confirmed his suspicions that the patient was indeed malingering.

But I'll never forget his black eyes and how he dropped his facade briefly to reveal a very manipulative and sick human being.  "
39,"That we are all the same. We think the same, we work in the same way, we will react to things in the same way and so on."
40,"That most men suck at doing Emotional Labor.

Yep, there are those gems who rock at it, but men are socialized to not even know it exists, so of course they're not going to do it. But it can be taught - Woohoo!"
41,"Very resentful. I did not give him permission to take the condom off, least of all ejaculate inside me. We were having sex, he stopped and said, ""I can't feel anything, need to take this off."" I said no no no, he held me down, and that was it. 

I had been seeing him for awhile but that was the first time we'd had sex, and we hadn't discussed birth control (other than that I asked him to wear a condom). 

He then got angry at *me* for not being on the pill. ""Why the hell aren't you on the pill? I've never met a woman who wasn't on the pill, how stupid could you be?"" etc. "
42,"&gt; I've met a lot of people who claim to be ""sociopaths"" but they're really just assholes.

this. tbh, most the edgelords who claim to be sociopaths fucking wish they could have that level of social skills."
43,"A guy once came in when I was working out at my apartment's gym (this was back in around 2007). I had a pretty consistent workout schedule (due to my regular schedule), so he started showing up every time I was there. Every time. 

Then he tried to approach me about a variety of odd topics (his car, he thought I looked like an old ex-girlfriend of his, he thought he found a cat - was it mine, etc). I tried to politely respond but with very monosyllabic responses. (Thanks, early brainwashing on how vital it is to be a good and nice girl!)

Then he began to try and walk me home to my apartment. I would walk in different directions and kind of try to gently get him to leave me alone, but he eventually figured out which building I lived in. I wish I had been braver at the time, but he creeped me out so much, I just stopped going to that gym. He would hang out in front of my building for a week or two after that but I made sure I stayed inside. Ugh, just typing this out makes me remember how fucking creepy that whole thing was."
44,"I worked out at the local stripper gym because it was the closest to my house and open 24 hours. (Stripper gym because the guy who owned tons of local strip clubs bought all of his dancers memberships there, so there were always tons of exotic dancers there working out.) I made it about 6 months before canceling my membership because a lot of the men working out there felt very free to comment on, approach, or touch the women working out there. Sure, lots of those guys got kicked out by management, but it seemed like there were always dozens more ready to take their place. It sucked, though, because the women are all very sweet and supportive of each other. "
45,...And that's probably why he's still single.
46,"I'm not an expert but one warning sign might be if he seems to only contact you ""on his time"". He might text, call, and ask to meet up, but neglects to respond when you try to initiate things. 
"
47,I realized I was falling in love with him when I would go to the store and find more things that I wanted to get him than things I wanted to get myself. 
48,Awww I feel so bad for him. You gotta let him know he's sexy. Put whipped cream and a cherry on yourself while he showers. Maybe he will see how funny it can be. 
49,"I've got a 2.5 year old and am in my first trimester with number two. This is so freaking hard; I'm tired all the time. My toddler is up at 5:30 every day and is super stubborn about everything and a very picky eater; I constantly worry that she isn't getting all of the nutrients she needs. 

On the other hand, she is so sweet. If she sees someone is upset she immediately wants to go up and hug them and tell them it will be okay. She wants to talk to everyone and be friends with every person she meets. She likes to hold hands with everyone and likes to snuggle me and her dad. She gets the biggest kick out of getting a butter knife and ""helping"" me with dinner.

I clearly like it enough to have another, I'm just crossing my fingers that the next one is a better sleeper than my first."
50,"Was he Mormon?

That's called ""parking it"" in the Mormon community and is apparently more acceptable to God. "
51,"They also call it ""soaking"" which I find hilarious. "
52,"This idea that you only need to work hard for what you want in life, and you'll get it (the ""American Dream""). Which leads to people believing that anyone who is poor isn't working hard enough. Which leads to Americans being unwilling to pay more taxes to have some things for free (education, healthcare), because they believe welfare queens and the likes will take advantage of it since they aren't work-orientated people. Now it costs a thousand dollars to breathe next to an ambulance, at least 20K to have a degree that is becoming more and more worthless, and tens of thousands to do the one thing humans, as animals, are ""meant"" to do (give birth). 

Edit: I understand that it's not technically free since taxes are taken ""away"" from you. But taxes cannot get you bankrupt, while getting cancer can in America. Reminds me of [this meme](http://www.kappit.com/img/pics/201601_2124_gggga.jpg). "
53,Never drink and choke. Just gotta play it safe.
54,"This happened two nights ago. My long-term boyfriend went down on me and it was amazing. Idk what it was, but I was ultra-relaxed. He's gone down on me hundreds of times, but this time was just incredible. When I came, I was seeing stars it was so good. 

Then he lost his balance and slipped...and he bit down on my clitoral hood. Just a tiny little spot. It hurt so fucking much. He freaked out and started crying because he's never hurt me like that and fuck it hurt so much that I just started crying from the pain. 

I'm laying there, splayed out and crying from pain and he's literally in the corner of the room, ass naked, facing the wall and straight sobbing. ""ARE YOU OKAY?? *sniffles* DO YOU NEED ME TO CHECK IT OUT?? ARE YOU BLEEDING?? DO YOU NEED A BAND-AID (lmao)?? WHAT DO I DO??"" 

I checked it out and I was just swollen and bruised. After much reassurance and hugs, all was well. The pain subsided after a few minutes, but nothing else. 

'Twas a night to remember, that's for damn sure!"
55,"&gt;handsome, funny, good company, had a really cool career etc.  
&gt;his van parked outside my house  
  
Was not expecting him to drive a van"
56,"People suck and are annoying. They are occasionally cruel and frequently thoughtless and the only way you can be with anyone for twenty years or more is being able to forgive and ask for forgiveness because everyone fucks up, including you."
57,"Had an ex insist that we needed to try a threesome. After quite a bit of cajoling we agreed to do it, but he slept with the girl without me beforehand. That was the beginning of the end for us."
58,"My son is funny, smart, and sees the world with lenses I can't understand, but admire. He's 3. He's also autistic. Every day is hard. Eating is hard. Noises are hard. Being in public is hard. Bathing, brushing teeth, blowing his nose are hard. I have to put on a brave and determined face every day. I fought for his IEP and preschool placement. He goes to a special ed school, and gets to ride the bus, which is the highlight of his day. He has a team of therapists and specialists. Every day of his life, from his traumatic birth to his difficult infancy to now has been a battle. Regret is a word I don't have the luxury of using- but if I knew before his conception what I know now, it wouldn't have happened. I love him and will fight for him the rest of my life, but there is never a moment of rest."
59,"Yep, said he didn't want to be with someone who did *that*. "
60,"I dated a legit sociopath. I have never encountered anyone so cunning, manipulative, selfish, and charming at the same time. It was a nightmare, yet somehow every problem ""we"" had (mainly his constant cheating and lying) was twisted in such a way that it was always my fault, or I was crazy, and i actually believed it for awhile. I've never seen anyone treat people so horribly and not only feel zero remorse, but act proud of it. "
61,"Pouch babies for sure! Marsupial babies are so tiny when they first emerge to crawl into the pouch, like little jellybeans, you would barely feel it. Then once they get big you wouldn't have to waddle around heavily pregnant all the time, you could let them out for a bit and take a break. Plus, you could carry your youngsters and still have both hands free to do other stuff. Marsupials have it all worked out."
62,"This is going to sound petty, but when they stop wanting to make tiny sacrifices for you. For example, if they aren't willing to buy you a coffee when they are picking up one for themselves. When they don't want to stay in with you, but rather hang with friends, if you've had really a rough day. Not wanting to rub your back when you are sore. When listening to your problems is something *extra* instead of a normal part of being in a relationship. Obviously someone shouldn't just be constantly sacrificing themselves, but when the little acts of love feel like chores or build resentment, then you're headed for trouble."
63,"The counter-argument to that claim is that the difference between flirting and harrassment isn't attractiveness.  It's *consent*.

So sure, if someone is more attractive, you're more likely to be enjoying and reciprocating their behavior.  But the difference isn't between hot guys grabbing your ass and ugly guys grabbing your ass.  It's the difference between mutual flirting that naturally escalates into butt touching, and someone pushing past a thousand ""leave me alone"" signals to violate your body when you don't want them to.

But, like, absolutely.  I have a thing for short beefy dudes, and that's also the type that tends to often find themselves attracted to PUA.  So it's awful.  There's all these guys that I've been like ""Ooh, he's really cute let me start a conversation with him,"" only to be met with weird alpha posturing and ""escalating kino"".  It's terrible."
64,"Once I moved a gym mat a bit further away from another gym mat, where a 60 year old dude was stretching. He said ""You don't have to move it, I don't mind being near other people."" in a non-creepy way, and I said ""Hehe. Yeah, no, I stretch out a lot."" and that was it. Not that uncomfortable. 

One perk with being ugly: creepy dudes don't harass me at the gym."
65,"You're absolutely right that getting mad at someone for something you *never* told them is ridiculous.

However, I've seen so many arguments among couples where Person A in the couple is mad that, for the millionth time, Person B has... left their laundry on the floor instead of in the hamper. Left their dishes on the table instead of putting them in the dishwasher. Put an empty water pitcher back in the fridge instead of refilling it, etc. Person B then says ""Why are you mad at me? If you want me to put my dishes away, just tell me and I'll do it!"" And the problem here is that Person B is expecting Person A to tell them to do it *literally every single time,* taking no personal responsibility to eventually just learn to do the thing on their own. There comes a point where you shouldn't *have* to tell someone something."
66,"My father is a sociopath. I cut him out of my life about 5 years ago. 

He was diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder around age 19 by the US military and was discharged before boot camp ended. All I know about that is there was ""an incident"" in the barracks and he was held in the hospital facility for a few days, then he was sent home with a diagnosis and Entry Level Discharge papers. (He later told people he was discharged for breaking his foot during boot camp, but that story didn't emerge for at least 10 years.) 

I've also heard tales that as a young man, he would pick up prostitutes and kill them instead of paying. I've heard this from him and from his high school classmates. 

He had a very strong sense of justice and structure, they just didn't match with society's. He felt he was Justice Incarnate (he used those words) and would take it upon himself to punish others for things he felt were wrong. His ""punishment"" was always more extreme than the ""crime"". For example, if someone parked too close to the line, he would put Superglue in their locks, which he saw as a 1:1 exchange. ""They inconvenienced me, I'm inconveniencing them."" (He actually bought superglue singles in bulk and always carried it with him. He superglued car locks about once a week.) 

My father got into computer programming as a way to stop people like himself (for dank profits) because he was a master hacker and cyber-stalker. One time, he felt someone at another table in the restaurant was rude to him in the lobby, so he convinced the waitress to tell him the name on the credit card receipt. He used that name to find out a ton of stuff about this guy (including address, phone number, employer, etc -- all pretty impressive considering it was 1998) and then he stalked the crap out of him. He sent this guy threatening messages, slashed his tires, called in fake complaints to his employer, called him from a burner phone at all hours... For like two years he terrorized this guy, until the guy moved to another state. 

He was a terror to grow up around. He was extremely paranoid about the government and believed a lot of conspiracy theories because believing them enforced his belief that he was smarter than everyone else and could see patterns no one else could see. He called school ""the idiot factory"" and believed that formal education was just a way to control the masses. 

Because of this, he ""homeschooled"" us kids. He also worked from home, so we were monitored 24/7 by him. (I put it in quotes because I think there probably is a real type of homeschooling out there, but we were not homeschooled. We were just kept at home and any studying we did was of things he wrote or printed off from the internet. When I was 11, he made me study The Anarchist's Bible. We never studied any accurate history or science.) 

He ran our household like a 1950s nightmare. My mother was not permitted to work and she had to report to him literally every 10 minutes if they were apart. He tracked her for the entire day. At dinner time, she had to put dinner on the table and we all had to sit silently in our assigned seats until he arrived. When he came to the table, he would first read a written list of complaints he had about the world that day and describe any punishments he had enacted. This could take over an hour and only he was allowed to speak. Only then could we eat. During the meal, he would play ""Devil's Advocate"" by picking a topic, assigning someone to represent a side, and then haranguing them until they cried. No one would be dismissed from the dinner table until someone cried. This could take three or four hours as we got older and more resistant to his ways. 

My father tried to avoid anyone knowing that kids were in the house. We didn't know any of our neighbors. Any windows facing other houses or the street had to be covered at all times. We weren't allowed outdoors even in our own backyard. To leave the house, we had to get in the car in the garage and then go (and only with him as a chaperone, or with my mom calling every 10 minutes to check in). The first time I went anywhere outside my house without my parents being within 5 feet of me, I was 17 years old and I ran away from home. 

Despite all of that, most people thought he was the most charming person in the world. He had such absolute control over the family that people thought we were perfect. What they didn't know was that if we didn't act like perfectly pleasant (and silent) children, we would be harshly punished at home. Once hitting us no longer worked, he would beat the dog in front of us. 

I have about a billion more stories if anyone is still curious about growing up with a sociopathic parent. "
67,"It's way too early to tell because our son was only born a couple of months ago, but so far No Ragrets! Even with all the crying and pooping and peeing in my face as soon as we take his diaper off. 

We decorated the Christmas tree last weekend and for some reason he found it hilarious, he was laughing his ASS OFF! I haven't heard such hysterical laughter, probably ever. It was so cute and contagious that my wife and I were crying with laughter and it was just the best.

Watching him makes me wonder, where did all that laughter go when we became adults? He makes me see the world like I haven't since I was baby."
68,"That we have an easy time with dating and relationships, and have our pick of partners.

True, most women find casual sex extremely easy to come by. But meaningful relationships? No.

I think a lot of guys would be VERY happy to have the same predicament, but miss the point that that's often not what we want."
69,Oh dear haha. I consented but regretted it instantly when he started fucking my thighs thinking he was inside me. Thankfully he came quickly. 
70,"I think the Disney Princess and Romantic Comedy thing always idealizes the process of falling in love, but a long term relationship isn't just cute fluttery epiphanies. Being with someone for a while is pretty great because you understand them and can feel comfortable with them, but it's nice in a different way than the butterflies. 

(Also, I think this applies to most people, but it seems to me that most of this media is geared towards women.)"
71,Did he break up with you because of the queefing?? Because that's totally normal! I mean they're the ones who push the air up there!
72,"i feel like ''dude'' is gender neutral, but i am no bro"
73,"I taught one. We'll call him 'John'. I know you're not technically supposed to class kids as sociopaths because lots of children show 'sociopathic' tendencies, but one kid I taught was way beyond the normal realms. He was 7 year olds when I had him in my class and maybe he'll grow out of it...but I can't help but think I'll keep my eye on the news for his name in a few years time.

He was completely uncontrollable in the school. A good day for John would be if he managed one hour of not hurting anyone. Most days, he would come in, someone would say 'hi' or something innocuous and he would scream at them, throw some chairs around at the walls, at people, at anyone who came in. He was paranoid, convinced everyone was out to get him and to hurt him. He once threw a chair at the kindest girl, the only girl in the class who even tolerated him (only because she was so nice!) and I pointed this out to him, asking him to explain what he had done; he said that she had once, two years ago, asked him to 'be good' and that made him mad. He held grudges from two - five years ago against basically every other child in the class. When new kids joined, he'd quickly find a reason to hold a grudge. Stuff like ""He wore the same shoes as me"" were just as valid as reasons as ""He breathed near me"" and ""Her hair is too long"".

He would go into stories about how he had stabbed his rabbits, stabbed his mum, stabbed his sister. These wreren't threats like ""I'm going to..."", this was like he'd come in and tell me, ""Last night I stabbed my sister and I saw all the blood come out, I rubbed my face with it. The police were called and they took me to prison so I stabbed the policeman too. I laughed as he died."" On and on, in so much detail.

He sexually assaulted girls. I know, he's 7 years old, it was never called that, but that's what he did. He would ask girls to go upstairs with him (where no children were allowed during break) and threaten them with violence until they did. Girls would go upstairs, he would kiss them, grope them. He told them they would get in trouble if they told on him, that no one would believe them. This all came out when one girl came up to me in class one day and said ""Miss...I have a huge confession to make. And it's because I just noticed 'Julia' said she was going to the toilet and John isn't in the room either. I think they've gone upstairs to kiss."" So I take this girl aside and ask her for more details. And this whole tale comes out, how she was the 'first' victim but she's noticed other girls are also 'disappearing' with John and so she followed them up and witnessed John kissing them too. How he intimidated them and pressured them not to tell. I investigated further and there were at least 4 different girls who came forward and admitted this was happening, 2 of whom COULDN'T EVEN SPEAK ENGLISH and the 1 was a lonely girl but the other girl was a 'queen bee' with insecurity issues. John clearly preyed on the vulnerable.

The ridiculous thing was that he was in a mainstream school at all. The awful thing is that I reported incidents multiple times EVERY SINGLE DAY and nothing really ever was done. He'd be taken out of class for like 10 mins, he'd pretend to be good as gold and sorry, then he'd come back and wreck havoc again.  A big problem was that our headteacher was frequently away as he was acting head at another school. So no one had the authority to do anything, to send him home or to punish him really. When I told senior management about the sexual assault stuff, they really didn't take my concerns very seriously and said they'd 'have words' with the affected parties. I had to take matters into my own hands, basically teaching up a group of girls (all 'victims') about consent and training them to be vigilant, who would report to me if anything happened again, who would stand up for any victims and girls who this happened to, who would look out for any girls who got too near to John, who would patrol upstairs with special permission from me to do so. The incidents stopped largely because every girl in the class eventually joined this group and became really good friends who stuck together, so John didn't have a way 'in' with anyone.

By half way through the year, I basically gave up on asking for help. I still reported every incident, spent an hour every day after school writing up all the things that had happened and how I handled it. How I handled it was basically pacifying John with what he wanted. He got to play with Lego, play on the iPad, use paints, use clay, anything really that occupied him. It vaguely 'worked' in that he would be distracted long enough to not hurt anyone, but obviously he didn't learn anything at all. I realised I had to prioritise the 29 other children in my class and that de-escalating was the only thing I could do. If he started to go off, I'd open up a new toy and wave it in his face, like ""John look if you get off the table now and don't jump kick that kid, you can play with this new Lego toy"". There were moments where he'd be responsive and listen, participate in the class, do a bit of work...but this was few and far between. 

The scary thing is that every agency was involved with him and no one ever found anything wrong. Wtf was going on. Social workers said his home was perfect. He had CLEAR medical issues (as in, soiling himself constantly) and apparently the doctors had no idea what was happening. Every educational psychologist he saw would say ""Something's wrong...but I don't know what."" and they couldn't fit a diagnosis to him. 

I have a thousand stories about John. It's been 6 months since I left teaching (for unrelated reasons but John didn't help) and I still think about him."
74,He is going to be a lonely dude then.
75,"My aunt is approaching her 60. Never been married. No kids. She got retired years ago but still working, mostly from home now. She loves her job. She takes the most number of vacations in the family, sometimes she travels the same day she decides to travel. She hangs with her friends, cousins, siblings but also likes staying at her house and watching movies, writing, and trying new recipes. She's one of the happiest people I know actually, never regretted not having kids."
76,"There is a guy who works in my industry in the next town over who is practically the doppelgänger of Adonis. I actually had a mild, mild crush on him because he was so hot, but when his crew joined my crew at the bar one night after work, he turned into a monster. Grabbing ass, sitting WAY to close, becoming incredibly suggestive, refusing to give up when I (and another woman there) politely tried to extricate ourselves from his presence. Fuck that. He's still hot, but it left an incredibly bad taste in my mouth. "

79,"I became Sherlock. Started carrying a little pad of paper and pen. Wrote down specifics that he said and when. 

Then, when he invariably changed his answer, I could prove to myself that he was full of shit.

He was full of shit.

80,"Been on reddit for awhile and nothing has ever made my jaw drop except for this small post we got going on here.

How in the flying fuck are people dedicating *hours* to sex?! Jesus christ on a crutch that's fucking insane! What jobs are you people working? How in the fuck do you have that much free time? 40 minutes is long by my book, I just can't picture myself ever having enough time to dedicate *hours* to doin the dirty.

EDIT: I can keep up with the plot of Inception and Interstellar but I can't even begin to fathom having *hours* to fuck another human being. This shit is freaking me the fuck out."
81,"I feel him kissing my forehead/shoulder/back of my head, in the middle of the night, when he thinks I'm 100% asleep"
82,"A few years ago, I had a friend who was very attractive and very into me. However, the feelings weren't reciprocated, and one of the reasons was how forward and, frankly, creepy he was.

He came onto me so many times in so many different ways despite me repeatedly rebuffing him. This kind of disrespect was just gross and a huge turn-off -- a *way* bigger turn-off than anyone's appearance could be. He'd make constant, obviously forced sex jokes and find any springboard to bring sex into the conversation. He'd make creepy comments about my body. A couple of times, he sent me unsolicited dick pics and claimed it was because he was drunk. 

Then, one night, he tried to kiss me *three times* despite me repeatedly telling him that I didn't want to kiss him and I wasn't interested in that kind of relationship. Finally, he proceeded to literally pull down his pants and whip out his erect penis with *no* solicitation from me, at which point I promptly grabbed my car keys and got the hell out of there.

The moral of the story is, there are things that matter more than looks. Basic respect and dignity are some of them. "
83,"I'm not really sure, but what comes to mind is if you start to notice that he isn't listening to what you're saying, or he acts disinterested when you actually want to have a conversation. Doesn't matter what it's about, either. He's only interested in your physically being there. I'm not saying it's the only sign or a definite one, but it's the first thing I think of. "
84,"Thanks, I am in a much better place. I ran away at 17 and have the lamest runaway story ever: I started sneaking out of the house to get to the library and study for my GED and ACT. A very kind librarian helped me out and was totally nonjudgemental of my utter lack of knowledge about anything, and he was really cool with piercings and dreadlocks and I had a minor crush on him. 

Anyway, I snuck out of the house to walk two miles to the library to study, just a few times because I was terrified of getting caught. Then I snuck out and took my ACT exam at the local high school and managed a 26 even though I totally flubbed the science portion. I used the library computers to apply to colleges and scholarships. I almost got out without my parents finding out except that one college (despite me requesting NO MAIL on every application) sent me an acceptence letter in the mail. My father was furious, he berated me for weeks about ""the idiot factory"". My mother was emboldened by it, though, and she signed my FAFSA so I could actually go. 

My father tried to prevent me from going and so I moved to the dorms in the middle of the night during welcome week. For some reason, my random roommate assignment agreed to pick me up. I had a really rough transition into the real world. But my experience with my father wasn't done yet. 

Around Thanksgiving, my father called the school and instructed them to withdraw me from all classes. It was a Southern Baptist school and parents ruled all to them. I got an email notifying me of my course termination. I didn't know yet that he had interfered so I went to the registrar and tried to undo it, thinking it was a mistake. She refused and told me ""Listen to thy father and mother"" and closed the clerk window. 

I returned to my dorm to find my father standing outside my room with two security guards. The guards informed me that because I was no longer a student, I was evicted from the dorms. I tried to explain to them that there was a mistake, I hadn't terminated enrollment myself and the law says no one else can do so for me. They didn't listen, they threatened to call the police on me. I packed up my bag and my father took me back home. (Looking back, I'm not even sure they were real security guards and not just dudes he hired.) 

I found out that my mom had finally left him, spurring my father to decide I needed to come home and resume housework duties. He confiscated my laptop and cell phone and my imprisonment resumed for another year. This time, he knew my tricks and kept me under video surveillance so I couldn't run away. It took a long time before he finally left the house and got far away enough that I knew I could leave without him being able to catch me. On that day, I ran to a neighbor's house (and then another and then another, as people turned me away) until someone let me make a call. I called a college friend and he came to pick me up. 

I moved in with my mom (who had never tried to get in touch for some reason, I'm still mad about that) and enrolled in a different college that promised to only listen to me about my enrollment. I also cut my father out of my life. 

It was a tough road to independence. I had no social skills and no study skills, so I was starting from the ground up. I joked that I was like an alien dropped on Earth because at age 20, I was just then learning about Nintendo and Pokemon and other 90s sensations. I had help from a couple amazing professors who literally tutored me on how to be a person. I became a first generation college graduate (summa cum laude!) and I'm working in my field. I'm married now and have two rescue cats. 

I got out, and life is good out here. "
85,I loaf you
86,"We're engaged (and got engaged afterwards), so obviously it didn't change much about our relationship. He was extremely supportive and very hard on himself about it all. I don't blame him at all, and if anything, he definitely showed me he can be relied on in a crisis. It made us closer if anything."
87,"I'm not sure this quite fits what you're looking for, but as a kid I grew up with a pretty old-fashioned view of what dating looked like. I expected my first date would happen when I was about 16, that it would begin with my date coming to my parents' house to pick me up, and that at some point we might have a conversation in which we decided to ""go steady"".

I don't really know what to ascribe this too. I grew up in the 90's, but my parents are older than most folks my age, so I did listen to a lot of 50's/60's music and watch a lot of TV/movies from that era too as a kid.

When I finally started dating, I was 17 and in college. I met him on the internet, and he didn't offer to come pick me up so I walked from my dorm to his apartment (about a mile) to watch a kung fu movie in his room. After 3 dates he started telling people I was his girlfriend without asking me first. It was pretty disenchanting, and I definitely felt that I missed out on the magic of ~young love~ that I'd expected."
88,"I think a lot of guys are bothered sometimes by not feeling like they're seen as sexy or appealing, myself included, but I've honestly never understood how anyone could think of people putting food on themselves as anything but hilarious. "

92,"This is one of my most hated stereotypes.

Also, it makes no fucking sense. Please explain how women have such a stronger support network -made up of primarily female friends- which allows us to be more emotionally open...if we can't have real friendships with other women. Either we have close female friends who have our back, or we're all catty to one another and can't be friends. (Fwiw, I think women often do have a stronger support network, the juxtaposition just nicely reinforces how this catty stereotype is crap.)

93,"The worst sex I had was with a military guy. We hooked up and he just laid there. I mean, seriously, he did absolutely nothing--no thrusting, no nothing. He didn't even touch me. It was really weird. He thought it was awesome and tried to call me several more times. "

97,"When his friend went missing and then when we found out that he had been found dead. It was very traumatic for my SO and although he doesn't talk about it much, I know it still hurts. It was grief that was spread out over 2/3 weeks because we knew deep down he was dead, we were just searching for his body. 

It was a horrible time and I just wanted to be there for him. There's not much you can say in those situations, you just have to be there. I held him when he needed to be held, left him alone when he wanted space and let him cry on my shoulder when he needed to."
98,"Oh man, more than I probably should. I recognize they're silly but I still love the idea. 

- for my lover to book a spontaneous trip out of the country

- for him to send me tons of flowers at the same time, like how they fill an apartment in the movies 

- any kind of grand gesture like showing up at the right place at the right time to rescue me from something or going out of his way to show me I am treasured

I know these aren't necessary for a good relationship and I don't expect them but I still like to daydream sometimes. "

* That we are all straight
* That women who are into women are only pretending to be to impress dudes
* That literally everything we do and say is to impress dudes
* That we all want babies
* That any improvements we make to our appearance must be for the sake of men who like looking at us
* That we only date people (read: men) based on their looks and wealth
* That we can't find conventionally attractive guys creepy
* That we all find the same things attractive (normally either what they look like or what they are insecure about not looking like)
* That regardless of what we say, all we really want in life is a man to protect us and children"

103,"This is only my experience. Please don't be offended.  Take it with a grain of salt. 

Men whose mothers were SAHMs are less likely to have an equal partnership in the home. If you're a career woman, you may have a disproportionate amount of housework if you date or marry one. 

I've dated and lived with quite a few people. The reason why I am marrying so late in life is because of this: working long hours and doing most of the work at home. 

Every guy that had a working mother was so much more willing and able to take his fair share. "

106,"At my last gym, there was a women-only circuit room and I did most of my working out in there. It wasn't super private or anything, it had a glass wall and there was no door in the actual doorway, it was just a bit separate. I was on a stationary bike facing the wall opposite to the door, watching whatever nonsense was on the TV, for 20 minutes, and when I got off and turned around this guy was standing just inside the door, staring at me. It was really awkward, I had no idea how long he'd been there. We just stared at each other for a few seconds, and then I awkwardly went and sat down on one of the machines. He was still silently staring at me, and a gym attendant came and shooed him away. I never saw him again. I don't know what that was all about."

112,"I took the advice of many women and doctors and ""had sex anyway"" when I wasn't aroused while trying to deal with a sudden onset of sexual dysfunction (which I'm still dealing with). 

Terrible. My partner did nothing wrong, but I still ended up feeling somewhat like I had been assaulted, despite the whole thing being consensual. Messed me up for a long time, made the dysfunction much, much worse. And my partner didn't even really enjoy it either, because of how thouroughly I wasn't into it, so it was a waste of effort and distress anyway."
113,"My first ""i love you"" went a little something like this... We were teenagers at the time. We were hanging out in my room one day playing with this dry erase board I had. We were drawing pictures and stuff on it. Goofy stuff. Anyway, I don't remember who, but one of us wrote the letter ""i"" with a empty space underneath then the word ""you"". One of us drew a sandwich inbetween. Something like this &gt;

I

🍞

You

We both kinda realized what we were trying to say to each other. Then replaced the sandwich with a heart and told each other ""I love you"". I dont really remember who actually said it first. He might have. It was a very special moment for us. In his house his mom over used the phrase. And in my family we never said that to each other. So for each of us the phrase carried a lot of weight to say to another person.

I just remember feeling so happy that he felt the same way about me that I felt about it. It just felt so right."
114,Schedule an abortion
115,"Considering he poked holes in condoms when he knew the antibiotics I was taking lessened the effectiveness of the pill..I was not happy with him.

127,"My kids are grown now and on their own.I love them dearly and they are my world....but I now, so many years later I envy those women who choose not to have kids. I think what my life would be like and where I would be if I did not put my life on hold and sacrifice so much to be a mom."
128,"1st time with new guy, he puked on my stomach.
Or the time I was really drunk and tried to be sexy while being on top and leaning back, lost balance and fell off the bed backwards ending up on the floor naked like a starfish having to pretend it didnt hurt"
129,That was his mating call 
130,"I was on the treadmill recently. I go at off times so a lot of treadmills were available. This guy chooses the one right next to me and proceeds to sing along very loudly to his music. I couldn't hear my headphones over his singing. 

I left and went to the stair climber. About 45 seconds later he follows me and stands in the stretching area behind me just watching. Singing was quieter though."
131,"There's been a few recently (we are walking through his OCD recovery together), but one that stands out is visiting his dad for Christmas last year. It was the first time he had seen his dad in about 3 years, so he was nervous. His parents divorced when he was 23, as his dad is gay, always had been and his mum was on some level aware of this before marriage and kids. His dad lives with his long term boyfriend now, and they were so hospitable and welcoming, his dad an utter delight who clearly loved his kids and grandchild unconditionally. After we left, my SO broke down on the drive to our hotel because ""seeing him was a reminder that he and his brother are from his 'old' life, and now he is ornamental furniture in his dad's new life."" That was so unbelievably untrue based of my experience meeting his dad, but it broke my heart seeing how traumatising his dad's coming out was on him. He had spent the last 8 years feeling like the product of a massive lie and illusion, and never showed it. Just took all the ""your dad's gay"" jokes and jabs his friends made in his stride, but it was killing him on the inside. Bright side, this realisation has helped him make significant progress in therapy!

Edit: Forgot to add this, didn't see the second part to the question! We got back to the hotel, told him he we didn't have to talk about anything he didn't want to, washed him in the bath like a baby, tried to goof around with him by swaddling him like a baby in the spare hotel blanket and I brushed his hair while he was wrapped up in his blanket cocoon until he fell asleep. His dad invited us back round for breakfast in the morning, and he said he didn't feel strong enough to go. I told him he was in fact strong for not holding it in anymore, and that I would literally hold his hand under the table the entire time if he decided to go back in the morning. He went, and we got a lot of funny looks from everyone while both of us tried to eat a cooked breakfast one-handed ha! Never been more proud of him. "
132,"In this case labour refers to work rather than giving birth. Expanding on that, emotional labour is basically expending effort being empathetic and caring and thoughtful to other people even when it's draining and often unrewarded. In a workplace context, this can refer to how retail workers constantly have to be smiling and polite even when the customer is treating them like shit, or how police officers have to be highly aware of their own body language and emotional reactions when doing things like taking statements.

In a personal context, it can mean stuff like listening to your partner vent for hours, or managing your own reactions and feelings to try and not burden them with it when they're feeling down, or remembering small details about your partner or friends like whether they prefer to be texted or called, or what terms of endearment make them feel good and which they don't like.

133,"Oh my god that annoys me to no end.

134,"Yes! Years ago my husband talked about getting a cordless phone &amp; then gave me one for Christmas. I opened it &amp; said, ""A cordless phone! Just what you've always wanted!"""
135,"Well, that ""ask a rapist"" thread from a few years ago was pretty disgusting. As is a lot of the stuff from subs like MGTOW and all the racist subs. "
136,"Haha, I fell off the bed once because I was trying to do a sexy crawl onto the bed towards him and my hand slipped, I face planted into the mattress, and then slipped down onto the floor. Thankfully it was with my long term boyfriend so we just laughed a lot and then proceeded to bang. He teased me about it until he fell off the bed because he misjudged where the edge was. Now we are even. And clearly graceful sexy gazelles, the both of us."
137,"I don't care, unless it's meant to be offensive."
138,Relationships in general with men or women are going to falter if you cast your partner in the role of villian or hero. When you make them the source of your emotions and emotional reactions the well will run dry. 
139,this guy seemed like he was going to finger me but he just put his finger between my labia and started thrusting it like he had no idea there was a hole he was supposed to be finding. nowhere near my clit either. it was kinda sweet because i don't think he had much experience and he was looking really serious and i was like whoo boy wait until you find out there's a whole next level.
140,"I have 4 kids - ages 9, 12, 14, and 16. (Coming up on four months of birthdays, so everyone turns a year older in the next several months.)

I always knew I wanted kids, and I always knew I wanted a ton of kids. I ended up having a moderate amount of kids instead of a ton for a few different reasons.

I don't regret it at all. Not even when I had four kids age 7 and under. (I do look back on that now and wonder how the hell I did it.) I'm going to have three teenagers in a few months and I still don't regret it.

I'm even a single mom now and I still don't regret it. I'll have four teenagers at the same time, *while  going through menopause* and I won't regret it.

Because watching your toddlers explore the world, and then watching your kids learn to understand the world, and finally watching them blossom into who they are going to be is one of the most amazing experiences. Probably the most amazing experience.

No, it's not all fun and easy and amazing wonder. It's like life itself - some days are good, some are bad, some are meh. Sometimes you have more of the good, sometimes more of the bad, sometimes they're mostly all meh.  

But I see value and the opportunity for person growth and fulfillment in the good, the bad, AND the meh.

If that's you, you'll do fine. "
141,I don't have a problem trusting my emotions at all. What I do have is a problem trusting other people in any way shape or form. Working on it slowly by trying to have a little faith in people.
142,"Two of my good friends recently broke up after a fight like this.

I heard about it from him first: that the gf was furious that he didn't turn down the TV.  All she had to do was ask, but she bit his head off over it, causing the fight.

Then I heard her side.  She worked swing shift and would be in bed asleep when her boyfriend came home, start up video games at high volume, waking her.  Every day she had to get up and ask him to turn it down.  One day she snapped

Basic consideration for your partner shouldn't be a repeated request."
143,"Use a condom. Regardless of what your partner says. Plan B is expensive and should not be used as a regular birth-control method.

144,"I mentioned I was into a mfm 3 way as a fantasy. He took it seriously and a week later came over with a friend of his. We had a few drinks and one thing led to another with no real prior discussion on his part except to tell me his friend was into it.

Turns out he really didn't like me fucking his friend after all. His friend began calling me, after he gave him my number. 

He used me sleeping with his friend as an excuse to sleep with another woman. I continued sleeping with his friend and stuff just became irreconcilable."

148,"Flowers all the time. They're like 10 dollars a pop, minimum, for a pretty boring bouquet, and if you're given them on a date you've got to figure out what to do with them all day, etc. But I still secretly wish I could be part of the romcom trope where the lady is getting flowers *all the time*. "
149,"I knew that he was a bad person and a bad boyfriend before I got pregnant, but I was very depressed and self-destructive at the time. The pregnancy was a huge wake up call that I was ruining my own life, but it wasn't fair to ruin a baby's. The guy was actually decent (for once) about it. He drove me, paid for half, and helped me when I was in pain.  I broke up with him afterwards. Both the abortion and the break up were fantastic choices and my life is much better now."

155,"Dated one. He proposed marriage after a month and isolated me from my loved ones to do horrific things. I got out when I caught him cheating and after he started a nasty habit of pinning me on my back and holding his hand over my mouth and nose to ""calm me down"" when we'd fight. He gaslighted me so badly. I remember one time, I got into an argument with him, and slipped the ring he gave me off my finger because I was ready to walk out. I tripped and it rolled under the radiator. I started crying out of sheer exhaustion (he had kept me awake with fighting and video games for days) and he picked me up, tucked me into bed, and convinced me that I had a high fever and none of it happened. He even found the ring and slipped it back on my finger. He convinced me to be his BDSM sub by pinning me down and flicking me on the face until I caved. I have so many stories like this.

People tell me he wasn't one, and to ""stop armchair diagnosising someone you dislike"", but they never saw his dead green eyes. There was no life in them at all.  He even admitted he faked emotion half the time because he didn't know what ""was expected"". At first, I thought he was just being edgy, but as time went on, I learned he was telling the truth. He really had no idea. And I can't explain it better than that."
156,"We wear makeup for them and that makeup is false advertising. It's my face, I'll do whatever I please. "

160,"Reposting a comment I made on another thread:

Not my current SO, but my ex was really into pegging. I tried it about 3 times, but every event ended in poop. Poop. Everywhere. Is that what is supposed to happen every time? Do other women here do that and experience an overload of doo doo?
After the third time, I knew I couldn't handle the smell... the sight of it. I wanted to please him, because I knew how much he loved it, but I nearly threw up every time... and actual shit is a mood killer for me.
Here's a nice ending I'll leave you with: ex-SO had a bit of a drinking problem, and one morning he woke me up after he'd been up drinking all night. He slurred, ""Can you get this dildo out of my ass? I lost it."" I was perturbed, to say the least, and just grossed the fuck out. I put on kitchen dishwashing gloves and went in almost wrist deep... and there was no dildo. There was lots of SHIT... but no dildo. He had to go to the hospital to get it removed.
I was done with it. Done with the shit, done with the ass play... just done. I can still smell it. Ugh."
161,"Music. For example when I wear my Nirvana t-shirt I get remarks like ""I bet your favourite song is Smells Like Teen Spirit"" or ""Do you even know all their albums?""

Apparently if you want to proclaim you're a fan of a band, you have to: know all their albums and B-sides; all the band line-ups in chronological order; have read their biographies and seen their documentaries; and know every song ever. "
162,"The vast majority of men have hangups about how women need to be filled with massive penises. That when we are with an average, or below-average person, we are just wishing it was bigger. This is so far from accurate, it's ridiculous. "
163,"I managed to lift a barbell up and over my head onto my shoulders to do squats, then discovered I was too weak to lift it up and over my head again. A nice man came and rescued me - my panic must've been visible on my face!"
164,"I'm no longer dating the lady, but she was getting more into being tied up and stimulated (with like ice or candle wax), and she also had been expressing how hot it was for me to take charge and take what I want.

So I ended up tying her up and started toying with her and out of nowhere she completely broken down, I panicked untied her and ended up holding her for a long while until she calmed down, but I never tried any of that stuff again. 

I probably should have tried again later, but it was super scary and I hated the idea of her feeling 'scared' around me. We also were long distance at the time, and that pretty much wrecked sex for the whole weekend (which was the only time we had), so the idea of trying something that could potentially ruin a small window of opportunity for intimacy turned me off from it completely. "
165,"A micropenis. It didn't do anything for me. So I thought fine, let him get off and maybe he'll do something else for me? Nope. 

Believe me, the penis was not the issue... The best sex I've had hasn't involved penises at all. But just humping me for 5 min and acting like that was sex - hell no."
166,"Pretty sure a kid I used to babysit was one, I know he is in jail now for assault and theft. Anyway, Im babysitting this 11 year old boy and he is just eating his baby brothers food jars, like dozens of them at a time. Its nuts, I called his mom and asked if this was ok, she said no, make him clean up and stop. So I said, hey Child, clean that up and do something else. Now this house was a open floor plan so we could see the kitchen, he starts chucking the empty glass jars into the kitchen cabinets as hard as he could, glass is just spraying everywhere. 

I yell at him to stop and say go outside, because I didnt know what to do, and I didnt want him stepping in the glass. Im on the phone trying to contact his mom and get some help when I hear this odd squealing sound and a THUMP on the patio glass. This is spring, in Iowa and the frogs are out, this kid is pulling their legs off and then killing them by splatting them into the patio door. 

I opened the door and asked him what in the name of god he was doing. He gives me this really odd smirk and tells me he is making the frogs scream. Asks me if I had cleaned up the kitchen yet, tells me he wants a knife to ""have more fun"". I told him to go to his room, he did, and then I called my dad and told him what was going on. My dad came and sat with me until his parents got home. His mom told me that this was normal and I was just freaking out. I noped out of ever watching for that family again."

After I'd made it clear that nothing was going to be happening between us he started pointing out my pimples. It was really gross and awful, and the fact that he was attractive was utterly irrelevant to the entire thing."
169,"""You have to carry a balance and pay interest to build credit.""  Not true.  You should never pay interest to build credit.

172,"I proceeded to lose my virginity to him. (Definitely the right time. I was 19, he was 26. Now we're happily married, and he's spooning me in bed while I type this.)"
173,"Lots and lots and lots of them.

I mostly ran into dudes that thought they were hot shit only because they were attractive people. It usually translated to them being extremely pushy, more than a little selfish in bed, and just all around kind of mean and arrogant. In two cases it got me a stalker, both of which escalated the creep-factor by a ton. In another one it got me some seriously nasty e-mails that got more and more deluded as time went on (and I did not reply).

Bonus: I learnt how to deal with creeps. If a handsome dude is a creep, it don't matter that he's handsome. It will make my ladyboner disappear.

It's still harassment if he's hot and I resent any guy that implies all I care about is looks (especially when those guys usually make it about my looks and nothing else)."
174,"Gaming (both video and board/tabletop/card). The only stores I've gone into and felt uncomfortable in, like I was intruding. I went for the midnight launch of Fallout 4 and was standing in line playing games on my phone to kill time and the dudes in line behind me were being complete assholes about that, like I'm a fake gamer for playing mobile games, like OKAY GUYS I'LL JUST HAUL MY CONSOLE, TV AND A GENERATOR TO THIS PARKING LOT AT MIDNIGHT TO WAIT IN LINE, seriously."
175,"Him- something about where he likes me to touch him
Me- ""So all of you?""
Him- ""I love you too!""
Me- ""That's not what I said...""

This was 2 days before we started officially dating. He turned red and was really embarrassed, so I said we'd pretend it never happened, which he was grateful for. 

He said it again 2 days later once we made our relationship official. I just kept the conversation going because I wasn't ready yet. 

It's been almost five years now. I tell him I love him every day, and we're getting married in October.

177,"That I will wake up in a period piece and my feisty bookishness will land me a handsome rich Englishman who is desperately in love with me... but in a strong silent way, not in a creepy obsessive way."
178,"For me it was being friends with benefits when I really wanted a boyfriend. I knew he was only after that, and sometimes treated me like a girlfriends, and then forgot about me for weeks, and came back for sex. 

I guess he was never explicit about it, but I would always confront him asking why we were not a real couple, and he never said anything. 

I still gave him all the sex he wanted, and ended up a mess and hating myself, because I wanted to be his girlfriend, not his friend with benefits.

I know a lot of people are okay with it, and that's fine, but I just couldn't do it when I was in love with him (or so I wanted to believe)."
179,I'm impressed with how you kept your cool. I would have screamed my head off telling him off.
180,"&gt;there will be a line of men trying to talk to her or ask her out 

And, even if they are? That includes total strangers, creeps, dangerous people, incompatible people, people she's not attracted to, people much older/much younger than her, people who are cat-calling her, people who won't take no for an answer, people who get violent when she isn't interested, etc. It's generally not like there are lines of people she knows will enough, is attracted to, feels safe with, is interested in, and who are compatible with her. 9000 options of something someone doesn't want isn't really helpful to most people.

* Plopping out an egg probably easier than birthing a full baby
* Baby can do it's eggy thing until it hatches, without the long term physically taxing need to gestate.
* Other people can care for the egg until it hatches if need be. 
* Probably don't even need to watch it the whole time. Can just get one of those warm lamps and go for gold. Maybe knit a wee egg cosey.
* If you have to lay an egg every month, still not a problem! Eggs have so much protein! Think of all the free omelettes!

**Edit:**

* I'm working on the assumption that the baby's development would also be altered and therefore a smaller egg is required.
* Also our current reproductive systems are developed for live birth. If we were doing egg births, it stands to reason that our reproductive systems (including the vagina) would be altered accordingly."
184,"I have 4:

1. Went on an exercise bike and my ass went numb quickly (not sure why). So, I got off the bike and walked like a [cat with a balloon stuck between it's legs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TE2r0vjkXK0) until I could get to the locker room. 

2. Talking to my friend about a my SO and I's favourite meal at a restaurant and a guy proceeds to cut into our conversation. Very taco-burrito conversation. We were also talking quietly, and he must have been eavesdropping pretty intensely.

3. I got jelly legged on a treadmill and just crouched there awkwardly after hitting pause. Got to my car, couldn't really put clothes on, walked as though I had just seen a ghost and then sat in my car looking so distraught for almost 20 minutes. Got a LOT of looks.

4. Was checking out someone I THOUGHT was my SO (dressed the exact same, exact same build, etc.) only to have it be the SO of the girl on the treadmill beside me and my SO was actually on the opposite end of the gym. 

My SO even said he saw me staring at the guy and the girl was staring at me with such anger. I mean - THEY WERE WEARING GREY SHIRTS, BLACK PANTS, BLACK SHOES, WHITE SOCKS, AND A BLACK HAT. Same height, same build, EVERYTHING. Same haircut and colour - and both from the back."

187,"My friend's younger brother was diagnosed as a sociopath in his teens after attempting to kill her several times as a child.

I only met him once, and even knowing he was diagnosed and knowing the signs, he seemed fine, charming even. My only memory of him involves singing karaoke together with him at one of their family events.

He struggled with various drug addictions as an adult, and died of an overdose last year. It's been very difficult for his family because it's both terrible and a relief to have him gone at the same time, and then of course they feel guilty for being relieved."

192,"That we can't just be people, that we have to first undo our womanness in order to be taken seriously. The whole ""one of the guys, pretty ------ for a woman, ------- with the best of them"" thing.

In fact, he didn't even care about anything she did or said - he'd probably love her even if she never did anything! At all! Ever! Like, this isn't hyperbole, this is actually what he told her.

I was like dude, that doesn't sound romantic, that sounds awful."
197,"&gt;That we can't find conventionally attractive guys creepy

This one drives me bonkers. I've been down voted in askmen because I dared say I was *pissed* when a guy in a club grabbed my ass, even though he was ""conventionally attractive."" No, I did not secretly enjoy it. And neither did my husband, who had to deal with me so flustered I could barely talk because I'd never had that happen before, before getting the guy kicked out. I always thought I'd react better, like a slap, but instead I just stared and walked away before tearing up. I'll remember his selfish, smug smirk for the rest of my life after I turned around to make eye contact.

Fuck people who have this view. "
198,"Met a guy at a gathering who I thought was cute. We talked only briefly, but enough so that it wasn't weird when he friended me on facebook. He messaged me and the conversation was neutral at first, but then he said he wanted to Skype a few minutes into our first conversation. I didn't feel comfortable with that so soon, so I made some excuse. He still kept pushing for it and also said he wanted me to come visit him in the city he lived in, which was hours away. 

Wanting to video call when we were barely acquainted, not taking no for an answer, and then wanting me to make a trip for him so early on seemed pretty creepy. After just that one conversation, I unfriended him."

We never even made it to the movie, because a few hours before I texted him a reminder of the time it was showing because I like to be early to movies. He responded with something along the lines of ""Watch yourself, if you start ordering me around I'll have to take you over my knee.""

I texted back that his response was inappropriate and made me uncomfortable, and he didn't bother to apologize at all, just sent me multiple texts saying I was overreacting and acting crazy.

I refunded the movie tickets, but wanted to see the movie anyway. Wound up asking this guy to go with me, who I'd recently been on a first date with. Objectively a less attractive dude, but much nicer person. We've been together 2.5 years and we're getting engaged."
204,"&gt;""rugby boy with a big cock""

Reminds of a couple of years ago when a dude messaged me on facebook asking for sex, to which I said no and also said that I had a boyfriend. The dude freaks out about how I didn't have my relationship status public, and then finishes with ""I hope he gives you great big cock!""

What is it with rejected men and their obsession with big dicks?"
205,"Hm I guess I don't think of it that way.  It's more like, we work a similar number of hours so we are both working.  I don't feel he needs to do something above and beyond because the product of his hours worked is less money?"
206,"Don't disregard another persons time. This is a boundary I pay close attention to in my relationships and it plays out in a couple of ways. 

1) If plans are agreed to, both should put in equal effort to respect the boundaries of each persons time. Don't force another person to run on your time. Cancel at the earliest moment before an event, arrive on time, keep the other person abreast of your eta, and release them from their social obligation as soon as possible (by saying they may carry on without you) when you run into an unexpected delay or cancel. Don't keep people past an agreed upon end, depart at the end of an event, or as soon as it seems most appropriate. Don't expect people are willing to give up more of their time, even in a close relationship- check in with a person and ask where their priorities lie. 


2) Likewise, if someone is unavailable to meet when you want to, don't pressure them to give up their time. Don't get offended if they have other obligations, and don't try to make people feel guilty for doing things you don't have an interest in or that you deem unimportant. If they must cancel an event, (provided they are considerate in doing so,) respect the boundaries of their time, accept their cancellation, compromise as needed, and carry on with your life.

207,"Nah. I got pregnant, but we participated in it together. Joint effort. I mean, he didn't feel resentful that I was fertile at that time any more than I was resentful that his one lil swimmer worked. "

212,"So one of my close friends is a trainer and when she used to train me, there was one guy who'd always hang around for a minute and chat with her, which was no problem. Rude to interrupt another person's session but not creepy. But then it'd get worse as he'd stop by, say hi and linger. Other times he'd pass by and walk real slow.

One time, while doing kettlebell squats, he came and sat down on a nearby table and just STARED. I could see in the corner of my eye he was there but ignored him until he said, all nasty, ""Niceeee form...beautiful"". I dropped the kettlebell and honestly don't remember what I said but I was walking towards him until my friend stopped me, asked him to leave and had one of her employees walk him out. 

Ugh. Like, guys are going to look/stare. Whatever. I ignore it. But that was so blatant and disrespectful that I couldn't hold back. I still see him occasionally but he's essentially just in the background as he doesn't come around anymore. "

He was all sweaty, flailing and flopping around, and gasping for air. I didn't know what to do, I just prayed it would be over soon, it wasn't, the fish sex lasted for at least half an hour. I never called him again."

223,"That... is gross. As a guy who always watches his manners and treats people with respect, I've always thought ""Yeah I understand the female only gyms, I guess"". Reading all the comnents in here - particularly yours - was a bit of an ""Oh, gotcha"" moment. People can be so creepy."

He took two licks, made a disgusted face like a kid who hates vegetables and refused to do more. I was so angry and it was such a blow to my self esteem. Having been with people since who have loved going down on me, I've gotten my confidence back. But I'll never forget that look on his face. "

In my experience those ""jobs"" usually falls to the woman in a hetero relationship."
234,"I am beyond pleased you ask. Adult swaddling should be up EVERYONE'S alley, it is just amazing when done correctly. Here are my tips to a good swaddle: 

1. While you may find the best benefits of swaddling come from a romantic parter being the swaddler, a trusted friend or family member can also provide this service to you, and you them, as not returning the swaddle is extremely inconsiderate.
2. You need the best, cuddly big blanket you can find. No mediocre blankets here, and never, EVER try this with a sheet. You will be disappointed. I suggest buying a blanket if you do not have one already to fit the purpose. My SO had a giant black furry looking blanket before I came along, this is now our swaddling blanket. We have dubbed it ""Minky.""
3. Learn how to swaddle correctly. If you do not have children that you have already practised swaddling on, youtube has many tutorials. It is imperative you learn the correct techniques, otherwise you are wasting your time. Tight enough you may lose feeling in your extremities by the end of the swaddle, not too tight that you can feel your skeleton touching your internal organs. It is a fine line to perfection here. 
4. Plan the logistics beforehand. I am 5'6 and 55kg's (120 pounds). My SO is 5'8 and 95kg's (200 odd pounds). I can't just have him sit on me and cradle him like a newborn because I will surely die. However, he can assume this position with me when he is the swaddler. He lies between my legs with his back on me when he is the swaddlee, somewhat sitting upright. Do not get discouraged! You will find your perfect swaddle positioning with some practise from you and your swaddle buddy. Open, constructive and honest communication between swaddlee and swaddler is paramount at this stage. 
5. Duration. This also takes practise. I find 15 minutes is optimal for a quick swaddle (a single 'swad,' as we have come to call it), but the duration of a prime time tv show is where the magic is. 30-45 minutes is the sweet spot. A movie, you will find, is far too long and you will both be uncomfortable.
6. Play possum. The key to a successful swaddle is to not move. Go completely limp, drop your full weight and let the swaddler mould around you to get to your maximal comfort position. This is not a time to be awkward, let it all go into the swaddle. For this reason, adorning the most comfortable clothes you own will only aid this process. 
7. Invest in straws so your swaddler can hydrate you without you moving. This is an important one. Hands and arms must remain in the swaddle at all times for it to be completely effective. 
8. When you are the swaddler, you will get uncomfortable. There is no way around it. To not interrupt the swaddlee's experience within the swaddle, announce quietly that you need to readjust your position and try to move them with you as much as physically possible. I have found having to move on my own as the swaddlee completely detracts from the experience, sometimes rendering it pointless and ending prematurely. 
9. Don't abuse the experience. Swaddles should be reserved for when they are really needed, otherwise you will not appreciate or profit from what the swaddle offers you and your swaddle partner. I have not had a swaddle in months, for example, because I am a grown arse adult who could deal with the issues causing me to want a swad or full swaddle, and my birthday is this weekend, so I know I am going to get the shit swaddled out of me. Delayed gratification should be strived for with this great delicacy. 
10. If your swaddler can incorporate your comfort food into your swaddle, you have reached nirvana. 
11. Optional: at the end of each respective swaddle, we bow to each other to show honour to the swaddle and our respective roles involved with it. 

All jokes aside, swaddling each other has become this odd glue that binds us in many ways, especially when we have a mental disorder forcing its way in between us at times. It is a very simple way to say to your SO ""hey, had a shit day, don't want to talk about it. Just need a swad,"" and you let the process melt your stresses away. Bonus benefit, our sex life is A+ since the introduction of swaddling into our relationship. Not that it was bad before, but it made me realise how many times I used sex as a way to fulfil some sort of ""closeness"" need, which cheapened our sex life, as did he. Swaddling gives both of us that in abundance, and we are so much more present in every other area in our relationship because of it. It definitely cannot hurt to try and implement!

Edit: Wowzers! I have awoke to find a comment on how to wrap an adult in a blanket is the recipient of my first guilding. I could not be happier right now! Thank you, kind stranger. If I knew who you were, I'd give you the swaddling of a lifetime. "
235,"I'd say it's an individual thing, but I do think women are a) socialised far more intensely to do these things not just for their friends and family but for total strangers and b) penalised *way* more heavily if they don't do them."
236,"Oh I was panicking inside you have no idea lol! I didn't want to cause a scene, I don't know why. In the moment I just wanted the ground to swallow him whole and I think I was thinking if I just acted like he wasn't there, he would give up. "
237,"It was the first time with an ex a few years ago. He was extremely good-looking and sweet, so I was more than happy to get the sexy time rolling. He wanted to role play, which is fine, but I was a little thrown off since it was the first time and all. We sat on the edge of the bed and he pretended I give him road head. He had his hands on the ""wheel"" and everything. 

After that, we get to foreplay for me. He goes down on me, but it's like he's trying to suck the entire lower half of my body into his mouth. No focused attention anywhere, just sloppy licking *everywhere*. 

Well, after I thought it couldn't get much worse, it did. He folds me in half like a rag doll and starts eating my ass likes it's his last meal. I was in shock and let this go on for much longer than necessary. After about a minute or two I scoot back, say I need to go to the bathroom, and sit in the bathroom for the next fifteen minutes sobbing into a towel. 

Edit: word"
238,"It's usually attractive guys that cat call for starters.

I can't count how many times some cut guy has come onto me while I was *with* my SO. They get between us physically and tell me how I should be with them instead of my SO because he's shorter than me, and I can do so much better. Right. 

I clearly don't feel harassed at all when that happens./s

There was also the guy that tried to date me, but never asked me to date. He always wanted to ""hang out"". And I'm pretty oblivious to 'signals' so I didn't have a clue. I thought we just both liked watching movies. I didn't even realize until my SO, who was just a good friend at the time told me buddy thought we were dating. That was actually super creepy."
239,Doing something I've explicitly stated isn't okay. Most of it comes down to lying or breaking a promise.

245,"Does it have to be with men? Most things apply to both. 

One harsh truth is: That person is not always going to make you happy. It's impossible. You're going to disagree; you will both grow and change; or something might happen like they might get sick or disabled. 

If ""he/she makes me happy"" is your reason for committing to them... good luck. The only way you'd be able to stay together with that as your foundation is by making sure they always match your ideal of what makes you happy. Which is exhausting for you, and suffocating for them. 

If you can enter a serious relationship knowing that they're going to make you angry and sad at times - and that you'll love them anyway (excluding things like abuse of course) - then you can get through shit together. The last thing you need in a tough situation is for your relationship to fall apart over it as well.  

I wanted to make sure I was happy before I committed my wife. She's not the source of my happiness; she's a person I share it with. "
246,"""Say it again.""

249,"Keep in mind that casual sex is *not* guaranteed to be pleasurable for women. Like, great, I can easily get 10 minutes of boring jackhammer action from some random douche. Man, being a woman is great!

I'm sure a lot more women would be into casual sex if it actually worked in their favour 90% of the time. "
250,"Conversely, that we don't care about men at all (if we're sexually attracted to them I mean) and that getting a girl to like you is some massive accomplishment if you're a dude. Otherwise, a girl is ""easy"" and somehow less worth your time. I especially hate this because, you know what, I enjoy flirting with men and when I'm attracted to a guy (and I've been attracted to a *lot* of guys over the course of my life) and I feel like it might be reciprocated, I will not hesitate to show it. 

I feel like straight dudes can't imagine being attracted to other dudes so they lowkey see something negative in women being super attracted to them and expressing this through flirting and/or sex. If they end up hooking up with a girl, it's like they succeeded on some great mission.

I especially found this humorous when one of my girl friends ended a long term relationship and kept talking about how she needs to get laid ASAP. A week or two after that, we went out and she hooked up with a male friend of mine. On our way home, my male friend kept talking about how he basically ""managed"" to ""get her to"" hook up with him. ?????? If anyone is a fucking conquistador in this situation then it's not you buddy"
251,"My first bf raped me when I was 16. I wasnt really ""over"" it by the time I was with my second bf. He wasnt very understanding of it, we were both young and I dont think he realised how much it had affected me. I had been very honest with him and before we had sex I told him about everything. A few months later he asked for a bj and I thought why not? I ended up a crying mess, while having horrible flashbacks and he was just stunned. This was the beginning of the end for us. 

He wasnt willing to have vanilla sex for the rest of his life and kept asking me for bjs. I was very firm in saying no and we ended up drifting appart. It was no ones fault really, it was simply a shitty situation."
252,"For both of my abortions I definitly resent the guy involved, but not because of the pain. 

For the first one, I was on the pill but it failed. I was taking it religiously, it took me and my doctor a while to figure that one out. I didn't blame the guy, there was two of us in it, but when I told him, he told me he couldnt handle it, told me to ""go get it taken care of"" and that ""ugh, you ruined my week"". I haven't spoken to him sense. 

The second time I got pregnant, I was off the pill and was drugged and raped by someone who I thought was a friend, 'nuff said."

262,"There seem to be a quite a few people who start talking poly late in the relationship. When they do that, you may as well receive it as ""I would like to start fucking exciting new people, but also still get everything I already get from you."" They don't so much want a poly relationship as they want a harem, basically. 

I'm not really sure how to feel about the poly thing. The open minded science fiction reader in me wants to at least give the concept a fair shake. The otherwise normal-ass nominally monogamous person raised with Judeo-Christian mores is more suspicious and squinty about it. I am certainly no expert on the concept.

But the one thing that does seem clear is that a legit effort at the poly life starts pretty much from the jump. Anyone being for real about it should be bringing it up, very clearly, near the very beginning, when things are starting to look serious. That way they can confine their dating to those who have an interest in it.

This other thing, where they start talking poly a couple years in when the new has worn off and they've gotten comfortable with you but they're also looking outside the relationship, that's just bullshit. When that happens you may as well just call that the moment when you need to break up with them, since they aren't about to do it properly.

263,"I'm a pretty heavy girl who has been trying to lose weight. I'm now a half-marathoner running upwards of six miles, five days a week. 

One day, I was in a hotel gym, and a really fit man walks in and sees me on the only treadmill. He sighs and huffs, looks at his watch, and leans against the wall. He makes a big show of tapping his foot, checking his watch, the whole thing. Then after five minutes or so, he walks over to me and motions for me to take my headphones off. I do, and he says, ""how much longer are you going to be?"" And I said, ""Another thirty minutes or so. I just got on, sorry."" And he looked at me, pointed in the general direction of my stomach and said, ""Cmon, sweetie. Do you really think it's going to make that much of a difference?"" 

So I stayed on for another hour. Just to mess with him. He eventually went outside and I later saw him running circles in the parking lot. 

It really bothers me how those sort of muscly gym heads are the first to talk garbage about fat people (fat women especially) and then act personally offended when fat people go to the gym and try to exercise. I have tons of stories like this one. "

272,"I have a cherished workplace trauma that I like to bring out every now and then when I need to make myself chuckle. I present to you- the *Poop Tub Incident.*

Ok. I was barely 19, and it was my first week on the ambulance as a newly-minted EMT. We had a call for one of our most notorious frequent fliers, a nasty old man who would sometimes call us just so he could have someone to verbally abuse. Anyway. 

We open the door and hear anguished cries coming from the restroom. Could it be that he was actually having a true emergency for once? Nope. We find him (did I mention that this guy was easily 400 lbs?) buck naked, wedged between the toilet and the floor. Apparently, he had stripped down for a shower, then settled down for a shit. He lost his balance, fell to the floor, and then promptly shat *everywhere,* and was now demanding we pick him up. 3 EMTs and a cop were not enough- we ended up having to get the fire department on scene to help out. We get him on his feet...AND THEN. Oh god. Then. He slips in his own shit and falls into the tub, and shits some more. Lubricated with his feces, his rolls literally form a hermetic seal within the tub, making it almost impossible to get him out. We realize that someone, somehow, has to break the seal before we can proceed. Guess who did the honors? The newbie, aka me. His wife gave me some elbow-length rubber gloves, and I had to reach in between the tub wall and his shit-covered adipose while he kept making lewd comments about how he should do this more often if it meant that he could get barely legal girls to touch his naked girth. I'll never forget the *sssccchluuuuppp* sound his...expanse... made as I gathered him out of the tub enough for the fire department to take over. And the smell... dear god. My partners and I laugh about it now, but I was almost traumatized by the whole thing- when I got back to the station I may have shed a few frustrated tears in the shower. "

283,"I noticed that they tend to awkwardly try and smother you with compliments. I mean the thought is nice but there's a time when it's too much. I think the idea is to try and make you fall for them by being overly sweet? 

And as someone said before, they talk AT you more than anything. They don't really care too much about what you're saying. I was talking to a guy once and I wanted to tell him how I made the decision to go back to school and I was excited. He completely ignored it and gave me some weird irrelevant compliment.

285,"Many years ago I was in my car, parked in a grocery store parking lot. I was pepping myself to actually...go in the store. Things running through my mind, like the easiest route to what I needed to buy. What the fastest checkout lane was. How to get in and out as quickly as possible.  

Then I got to watching, for about an hour, other people who pulled their cars into the lot and jumped right out of their cars to go walking in. Seemingly without a care. I am sure that wasn't the case for everyone but to me, in that moment, it appeared to be! I didn't understand why I couldn't be like that.

288,"Haha, oh god no. 


I'm very rarely hit on. I've been asked out maybe a couple times in my life. I've rarely had men ask for my phone number. I don't ""chat"" with lots of dudes who are trying to get in my pants. I cannot imagine anyone in my life having a crush on me. 




It makes me confused about my attractive-ness level. People say I'm attractive. I think I'm decent. But then these dudes assume all attractive women are hit on all the time, and I'm never hit on, therefore I'm unattractive. 



So really I dunno. "

292,"This makes a lot of sense. I was always kind of confused when guys would call me a dyke or a lesbo when I didn't respond to their flirting or I wasn't giving them all of my attention. Like, why does me not being interested in you mean that I am gay? It makes me sad that people think that way."
293,"I used to work out at the YMCA, and one time when I was there an elderly man (who was later explained to me to have dementia) got on the treadmill with me. So I was running and he hopped on and I didn't notice cos I had headphones in, at first. It was too fast for him, so he didn't even fully hop on before he stumbled, and grabbed onto me to regain his balance. Needless to say we both fell off. 

I had another guy take out my headphones while I was stretching to ask me if I liked Nutella. He had that massive shit-eating grin that guys get when they're about to telling a really stupid joke, so I knew he was trying to lead me somewhere. I know that 'what's the difference between jelly/peanut butter and jam' joke so I thought it might be along those lines, so I didn't want to respond in a way that could lead to the punchline so I just said, 'Why?' He asked maybe about 10 more times and I just kept asking him why, until he got angry, called me a bitch and stormed off. 

I have forever regretted not playing into it though because for the life of me I cannot figure out where that joke was headed. "

304,"The first time I had sex, my partner was a bit nervous and couldn't keep an erection. I really wanted to at least see him cum, so we abandoned PIV for handjobs and blowjobs. Still nothing--he had conditioned himself to only be turned on by porn and his own hand.

Well, I still wanted him to cum, and so did he. He looked up some asian porn on his phone and started watching it and jerking off. I was so turned off by this point; the moaning coming from his phone was distracting, and he was just staring at the phone and not looking at me at all. He finally cums all over my chest and collapses on the bed.

He never stopped the porn on his phone. He wasn't watching it anymore, but he just lay there for the longest time while I kept hearing ""oh,"" ""ah,"" ""mmm,"" from his phone. I finally paused the video after a few minutes because the moans in the quiet room were all I could hear.

It got a lot better, though! At first it was a struggle for him to stay hard while putting on a condom, but after a few months, everything went smoothly. I still cringe thinking about that first time, though."

308,"When we were physically intimate for the first time, he was so nervous that he was shaking.

309,"This was brought up today in a different thread, but when we learned I was pregnant and found out that we could not keep the child without the risk of permanent nerve damage to me. It sucked. I cried a lot. He cried a lot.

As far as how did I comfort him? At times I felt like I needed to be strong for him, because he was taking it so hard. We just did whatever we felt like we needed to do. If we needed to cry, we cried. If we wanted to lay in bed and eat ice cream for dinner, we did that too. It was a judgment free zone, and it still is. I'm so lucky to be with someone who's not afraid to be vulnerable in front of me. "
310,"Their compliments don't reflect who you are. 

Before I came out I was dating a guy and when I asked him why he liked me all he could tell me was about how I made him feel.
For example:
""You make me happy""
""You make me feel good""
""You make me feel like life is good""

When I asked him what he liked about my personality he said I was sweet and outgoing, that I was emotionally open and incredibly bubbly. I'm a bitter, sarcastic, closed off cynic who uses humor and sarcasm to deflect. Dude didn't know me at all  he was just talking about who he wanted me to be."
311,"He had a MASSIVE butt pimple. Like, the size of a toonie no joke. He was so hot except for that! Every time we boned I was so distracted, I fantasized about popping it with a safety pin. I don't know what's wrong with me. "
312,"I wouldn't call them ""sexual experiments"" but I really want to share my story because I've never been able to tell the full story and I kind of want to get it off my chest. I have a therapist but I can't talk to them about it because they're military affiliated and obligated to report. I had a therapist where everything I told her was completely confidential but she left and I don't feel comfortable speaking with anyone else about it.

My husband has, multiple times in the first few years of our relationship regularly (I now know) technically raped me. We've been together for 6 years, married for 3. After talking with a therapist over the summer, she explained to me that what happened to me was rape and is a large part of why we have a strenuous sexual relationship to the point to where I'm almost always not interested. 

When we first got together, our sex was great and extremely frequent. Then, eventually, we got to a point where instead of solving our problems we'd just have sex and I would be left feeling extremely unhappy and he wouldn't really care. I told him that from that point forward we couldn't have sex until we solved or at least talked about our issue because our relationship was getting worse. Thus began the abuse. He had a serious drinking problem, so he'd get drunk and tell me either I could have sex with him (or give him a blow job) or I could get out. If I tried to leave, he'd block me from the door and tell me I couldn't leave. I'd try to sleep on the couch, but he'd harass me and wouldn't let me sleep until I had sex with him. So I'd just have sex with him so he could leave me alone and I could get some sleep before I had to go to work. Sometimes we'd talk about the problem but he never cared about the conversation or about implementing the solution; he would pretend to care until he got what he wanted and then he would just continue to do the same things that I had a problem with. This went on for almost 2 years.

To this day I hate BJs because I never felt like I had a right to say no. I didn't like doing them in the first place, so being forced to do them made me hate it. 

Then his dad died. Then he shipped off to boot camp. He came back from boot camp and promised me that things would change, it would be different. I chose to believe him and we got married. However, even though our problems weren't as bad as before, they went back to being shitty 6 months after we got married. We moved almost 2,000 miles away from home. I had no support system, a low paying job, and no recourse. I was told constantly that I could leave if I didn't want to do what he wanted me to do but he knew that I wouldn't because I couldn't. I didn't have the means and I didn't have the support. So we were stuck in our same old cycle.

The turning point happened when he decided to go out drinking and I told him don't come home if he was drunk. I knew what the situation would be like and it would be best for the both of us if he just spent the night where he was instead of coming home. He decided to come home so I locked him out of the house. Once he got into the house, he was livid, demanded sex. I told him no and in the middle of the night he took my clothes out of the closet and threw them out on the lawn and told me to leave, so I did. I drove for an hour and a half to the nearest city and took a nap in my car before I called into work and drove another 3 and a half hours; I ignored over 30 calls. Finally, I answered one of his calls, he apologized, said things would be different, apologized genuinely and I drove back. Ever since, we've been working on progress. 

It's been 3 years now and it hasn't been easy. We have constant set backs but we're both trying to work towards fixing the damage he caused me for 3 years. It's really hard mentally for me to get over everything, especially when I feel like he's falling back into bad habits. I made him stop drinking, and he did for awhile. We're going to start getting professional help soon because I still don't know how to get over everything and just let it go when I see the patterns happening over again sometimes. Things are 100x's better than they used to be but the damage is hard to repair."

314,"For real! To be fair though, that sounds like the reaction of a very, very inexperienced man. No doubt he'll be put in his place if he hasn't already.

He cut me off of everyone that could help under the premise that I was his property and he owned me, I was to inexpierenced to believe otherwise, so I let it happen thinking it was what I wanted. 

I eventually left when I met back up with my best friend and he taught me what was happening wasn't okay.

We wanted *our* baby and science gave us the chance to have it. How/why anyone thought it was any of their business boggles my mind. We even had parents offer to pay for the adoption but refuse to help pay for IVF even though it cost far less at the time (I have no idea what the going rates are on either one now).

378,"I think my youngest son(11) is a sociopath in the making and it terrifies me.

I didnt have him for many years(lived with his dad), but every summer I got him things were odd, tantrums that lasted for HOURS, and over nothing, maybe a kid in the area wouldnt let him ride a bike, something like that, he would attack the child, hurl racial slurs and then come home crying like his world was broke and gave me some really detailed lie, that for a while I would believe, that is until the parents would come to talk to me with a bruised and battered child. But my son, even when caught on tape will say, thats not me. I didnt do that. Or when in a ""good mood"" will tell me, he deserved it because (reason that makes no sense).

And then I got him this year,  he came to us telling us this massive story about school, how everyone ganged up on him, how they were tormenting him. My ex said it was happening, the school too, so he was moved to my house to get away from it. For 2 weeks he was nice and good, and then when he would get angry he would start destroying stuff. Anything that we held value on, he would find it, break it and leave it out for us, when we would find it, if we werent really angry or sad about it, he would yell at us and say we ruined his fun and then find something else to break that would hit closer to home. When asked about it, he says our stuff means nothing and we all deserve to die, and if we did, it would be his to break anyway.

 My current SO's mom died of cancer, and my son got angry at SO so he gives this really creepy smile to SO and says in a sing song sick voice, Im glad your mom is dead, I wish I would have seen her dying, I would have liked to see you cry.

My son is now 11 and he is in a inpatient at a facility here. For 2 weeks he was good, then he tried to choke a staff member for taking away a colored pencil he was trying to stab another kid with, in the eye. Now he is being moved to another treatment place for at least 3-6 months. Every night he calls me and tells me he needs to come home, when I tell him no, he tells me how he wants to kill me, in detail. When I asked him why, he said it was because I wouldnt let him shower every other night, instead of every night. And if he had to murder me its my fault and he wants me to know that.

Is he where he needs to be getting help? Yes. Will I be surprised if he turns out to be a serial killer? No, not one bit. My heart is breaking daily, something is wrong with my child and I dont know if it can be fixed. He was a child of rape, my only thought is he was conceived in sorrow and anger and he is a child of sorrow and anger."

I was so scared and alone, and at the last minute I changed my mind and tried to get up from the table. The nurses held me down and told me I was too young to have a baby, and since the IV was already in my arm they put me to sleep. I woke up with the most profound sense of emptiness and was the only woman in the recovery room who wasn't sobbing. I was just... empty. I struggled for years with who made the right decision in that situation, so much so that I didn't tell a single person for 4 years. It's been 11 years now and I know that having an abortion was the right choice, however I still get enraged when people say women who have abortions are ""murdering babies"", because they have no fucking idea what some of us have been through.
