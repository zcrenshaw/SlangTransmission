0,"It's wishful thinking. I've never had a single urge to do anything sexual with another woman. But people who claim there are ""no truly straight women"" will argue against that and say I don't know my own feelings or something like that, and it's hard to counter those kind of arguments because it will always come back to ""but you don't know your own feelings, you're repressed"" or something silly like that. Like a stranger would somehow know me better than I know myself."
1,"For being left handed. 

For the record this was an adult I was romantically involved with. He heard and believed that left handed people are demonic or something. 

I devoured his soul shortly after."
2,"When playing the ""Life"" boardgame, you **must** go to college.  Starting your career immediately wasn't an option.  (When my sister and I played this with friends, we realized that my friends were far more successful in the game than us because they started a career immediately)."
3,When I moved in with my SO I had to start washing my bras more often so he didn't think I was a filth goblin.
4,"- I don't want the additional expenses that come with dog ownership  
- I don't want to pick up poop  
- I don't want to go for a walk everyday"
5,"My mom taxed my allowance and made me divide it up into three different funds (needs/wants/charity) which I then had to keep track of in Excel spreadsheets. 

I'm grateful now, but man was I the saltiest of 8 year olds.

Also wasn't allowed to drink soda or get my ears pierced until 13, at which point I was no longer interested in either. "
6,"For aborting a dead fetus. And to be clear, they knew the fetus had died. "
7,"I was absolutely *not* allowed to play The Sims. I can kind of understand my mom's reasoning, she was worried it would teach me that money would buy happiness and I would spend too much time playing a fake life instead of living a real one.

So, instead of The Sims, my parents let me play Diablo II. "
8,"Non-American here. I'm not that worried about Trump for the USA, the president in the USA does not have THAT much power to totally ruin things in politics, the crazy laws Trump wants to pass would probably not pass anyway. 

I'm far more worried what the Trump supporters, racist, misogynistic people will do if Trump gets in charge. Such people get louder and bolder when they believe they have the majority (and the president!) on their side. There have been too many examples in the world throughout the years."
9,"My mom did sooo much research on black hair because she didn't want me to walk around ""looking like I had a white mom"" 

I was born before the internet was really a thing (the mid 90's) so she would just ask random friendly looking black women in the supermarket what to do!  "
10,I'm more worried about his supporters than I am about him being elected. The fact that those people exist in such huge numbers is both worrisome and embarrassing.
11,"I am already exhausted from the people erasing the fact that this was a fucking targeted attack against queer people and not just another mass shooting.

My heart is broken. Homophobia is real and raw and this is about so much more than guns."
12,"Sometimes he'll turn to a stranger and tell them that he loves me. It mortifies me, but he finds it amusing."
13,"I was sitting on a bench at a train station. There are two empty seats next to me, and three other completely empty benches nearby because it's early morning and hardly anyone is there.  This bench is in the middle of the platform, so the furthest from any entrance. An older man with a cane walks up to me. He tells me I need to move so he can sit down. I tell him there's a spot next to me but apparently he wants me exact seat. He's not a regular at this train station, at least I've never seen him at that time, so it's not like it's ""his"" seat. He gets visibly upset and tells me to move again, so I'm like, ""Whatever, fine,"" pick up all my stuff and move to the empty bench two feet away. 

I was telling this story and apparently I'm an entitled millennial with no respect for elders or the disabled. "
14,"But then on the flip side, any lesbian or bi woman hasn't found the ""right dick"" to be straight. We just can't win. "
15,"You have to identify the type of hair and take care of it properly with the correct products. I use Shea Moisture for my shampoo and conditioner and it does wonders for my curls! Check out reddit.com/r/curlyhair for more information on which ingredients and products actually damage curlier hairs. This goes for a boy or girl child! Mostly important for girls as their hair will most likely be longer and need a lot of maintenance.

When I was younger, I was so jealous of girls who would simply wash their hair and dry it. It would come out straight and shiny naturally. If I left my hair wet and let it dry naturally, there would be a huge tangled bush. (Can't tell you how many times I've had combs broken in it) It takes a lot of patience and maintenance! Let me know if you need any more tips on this kind of advice!"
16,My MIL got me a gift certificate to a tanning salon 4 months after I was diagnosed with melanoma. 
17,"He cannot answer a simple yes or no question with yes or no. It's always every feeling, thought and emotion behind it without actually ANSWERING the question.

i.e. ""Hey cuddlenoodle SO, would you like some bread?""

Cuddlenoodle SO: ""I love bread. I had bread yesterday but it wasn't as good as the bread here, but I am looking at my macros lately. But this bread looks amazing!""

Other person: ""Uhhh...?"" *looks to cuddlenoodle for answers.*

Cuddlenoodle: ""Give him bread."""
18,"Don't impulse-buy. Go shopping only when you need something and have a list of what you need, i.e. I want a maxi dress, ankle pants for work, and a couple work-appropriate short sleeve shirts. 

Buy pieces that work with multiple outfits. Take inventory of what you have at home before you go shopping.

Accessorize! I used to be bad at this, but I'm getting better. A scarf, necklace, belt, etc. can change a whole outfit. 

Clean out your closet a couple times a year (I do this in the Spring and Fall). If you haven't worn it in the last year, get rid of it! Unless, of course, it's a special occasion dress or something. 

Finally, don't be afraid to experiment. Sometimes you never know what will look good together until you try it on! Mix and match what you already have!"
19,"1) I wasn't ever allowed out. All I got to do on week nights / weekends was stay locked in my room with SAT prep books. This started when I was in 7th grade.

2) No tampons.

3) ""You can only trust your family, everyone else is lying to you."""
20,As is tradition. 
21,"After my rapist raped me, he was furious that I didn't want to be friends with him anymore (or go to prom with him..wtf?) and upset that ""now people think I'm a rapist"" (yeah that's what happens when you go into someone's home and fuck them when they're running a 102 fever, on their period, and repeatedly pushing you away). He called me every name under the sun, would send me pages of rants detailing why I was an awful person, posted statuses on facebook about how I was a gold-digging slut because he bought me gifts (that I didn't want or ask for).

Every year for years he will send me a message trying to get me to talk to him. Last time I got one that said ""I'm sorry we're not friends anymore, I just wasn't ready at the time,"" like it was his decision to cut contact and I was the one pining over it. The year before that I got a ""I'm sorry but I don't even remember why we don't talk anymore."" I can't even lol. "
22,"I was born with an underdeveloped nerve in the brain that limits some facial movement. I can't smile with my teeth showing, but because of the limited movement I'm a really good liar and can deliver sarcastic humor well. My doctor said I won't get typical face wrinkles from this. I love my ""perpetual poker face.""


Edit: not sure if it's related but I can stick my whole fist in my mouth.
"
23,Dunno if this counts but I find my voice when I have a cold really sexy 🙈 ( I have no idea why pls don't judge)
24,"My mom refused to let me shave my legs, because she was afraid to shave *her* legs because she had cut herself enough to bleed a lot once, when she was younger. This was a longterm fight between us for quite some time, and she didn't back down until we were packing for a trip to Florida in high school, and I was only packing pants because I said I'd rather get heat stroke than have to flaunt hairy legs.

I mean, *now* I only shave my legs intermittently and don't care, but as a teenager? It seemed even MORE important because she wouldn't let me, because she wasn't making the conversation about beauty standards or peer pressure, but about her own fear, heh.

(Once I did start shaving and didn't die, funnily enough, she started shaving her legs again, too. Weirdo.)"
25,"No going out anywhere where there would be people around my age without a chaperone, because there would be boys or corrupting ideas. 

I wasn't allowed to read books, watch shows or movies or listen to music without getting the okay from her that I was allowed to consume that media. I was not allowed privacy in order to better enforce this. 

I was not allowed to make a phone call unless she got to listen in on the other end of the line. 

I was not allowed to express any outrage or discomfort when she combed through every scrap of paper I had written on (that she could find) in order to make sure that I did not write any sinful things or have friends who had written any bad things. 

If she disagreed with a school subject, I was not allowed to answer the questions correctly. She would look at the homework and tests to make sure. "
26,"i think its unfair that someone who has gone thru male puberty can compete against those who haven't. like the whole point of gender segregated sports is to prevent this, i assumed. but i also just don't care about high school sports, so."
27,fucking cannot take a smiling photo. it always looks super forced or like a weird grimace. i'm pretty naturally always smiling and it always looks like i'm forcing him to take photos/be with me. hahah.
28,"I feel like I ran out of emotions to give over shootings.  I feel like I stopped being able to be horrified because it just happens so often that the helplessness and despair was too overwhelming.

It's not like I think it's ok.  I think it's utterly awful.  But I'm not watching the news or paying attention, because it feels pointless.  Nothing's going to change.  It's just going to be the same internet arguments and empty statements from politicians and the next shooting will be in a few days.

I guess a lot of people feel this way, and that's really sad.  That's it's so commonplace we don't get too fussed about it.  When Columbine occurred everyone was bowled over by the horror of it.  We were paralyzed as a nation with shock and disgust. But this shooting we'll forget about soon.  "
29,"I don't like the thought of being pregnant, labour, raising children, being a parent or any of the compromises that come with that.

I also don't really like children. 

So, it wasn't a super conscious decision. It's just how I feel. I'm only 19 so it's not caused any impact yet.

Oh, overpopulation also. I ain't contributing to it."
30,"&gt; I'm grateful now, but man was I the saltiest of 8 year olds.

Haha I love this. My mom drew up a formal contract with us about how much allowance we were to expect each week, and what items we would be responsible for (lunch money, clothing, entertainment) that she would *not* help with if we ran out of money.

My friends found it super weird, but I think it taught us financial responsibility. Once I didn't eat lunch for a month because I blew $60 on a hamster."
31,"Realizing I didn't have to have kids is what caused me to decide I wasn't having any.  Growing up it seemed like I had to have kids, which I had kind of admitted to myself, ""Well this will be a miserable time in my life, but I'll get through it"".  When I realized having kids was optional, I decided I wasn't going to.

How has it impacted my life?  I feel much happier, not having pressure from something I don't want to do.

How has it impacted my relationships?  I only date people who also do not want children."
32,"We went to the supermarket yesterday, and when I turned around he had two melons in his shirt and shouted ""HEY, LOOK AT ME! I'M MSSTARK!""

I didn't know whether to laugh or cry."
33,"My grandmother gave me a pair of used underwear for my 16th birthday.  She'd had someone my size staying at her house and the girl had just left, so they got passed on to me wrapped in a nice little gift bag."
34,"That the USA is so painfully behind on this issue that I don't really find it all that worth talking about. 


Like - it shouldn't even be an issue. It should be normal for women to be considered viable presidential candidates. Wtf is wrong with America where this is so unusual and remarkable that it's actually worth discussion? "
35,"Oh man the US would legit lose a shitload of respect globally.

As a non-American - it was mad hilarious at the start. But now there's an actual chance, and it's like ***""SERIOUSLY GUYS?! HAVE NONE OF YOU SEEN IDIOCRACY?!""***.

"
36,"Be honest with them and don't hide racial problems. 

Example; a white women with a black child likely wouldn't have issues with police or too many random occurrences of racism. If that child ventures out alone, it's a completely different story. 

Learn to do their hair.

If possible make friends with black women who have experience raising black children. Make sure your child is connected to their roots and has multicultural friends. "
37,"Very deep back dimples. I'm not alone in liking them, though - ex used to call them his thumb grips hahaha ugh"
38,One year I threw myself a party because I thought it would be fun. The only ones that showed were two of my SOs friends and one of mine. Out of thirty people. I know it's not a present but that stung. 
39,"He doesn't care what he wears. Usually if we're headed out together, he can tell by my face that something needs to be changed. Hint: it's probably the (literally) holey shirt you have on. 

I've learned to just laugh if we're meeting somewhere. Example: Last week we met for lunch, he had a long sleeve, button up, red plaid shirt. I was mildly impressed. He got out of his truck.... in grey basketball shirts with a blue stripe, long black socks, and old cowboy boots. It was hilarious!"
40,"My mom was/is also anti-tampon. She believed tampons stole your virginity (anything that penetrated, really) and virginity was Very Important. (After the loss of virginity, which should happen only with your husband, then tampons should not be used because that place is only for your husband.) She only bought me these giant overnight pads that were thick like diapers, not even pantyliners. I bought my own tampons once I started babysitting at 13. 

To say my mom's ideas on gender roles are problematic is a massive understatement. "
41,I used to work on roller coasters and would frequently have to tell small children that they were too small to ride. Apparently I ruined so many lives? 
42,"My now-ex husband didn't say a word about my birthday all day, until about 11:30 that night. He handed me a card, unsigned, with the envelope, still in the bag, with the receipt in it too.  He said happy birthday and acted like I was supposed to be thrilled with his thoughtfulness. The next day he took me shopping so I could watch him buy himself $600.00 worth of clothes; nothing at all for me. But hey, I got a card, right? "
43,"Whenever ""The Circle of Life"" plays at the football game and people lift up their babies like Rafiki did Simba, he lifts me up.

We are the only adults in the entire stadium to do that.

I actually love it."
44,Florist or someone who does stuff with flowers. Botany.
45,"I once asked why Ronda Rousey wasn't matched against men her own size, and some of the answers were very thorough.  A few Redditors explained to me how (due to bone density and other physiological differences) a match against a same-sized male opponent would still be unfair against Rousey.

Like it or not, there *are* differences in men's and women's bodies.  It doesn't mean we should discriminate, but it makes it extremely difficult to figure out what is a fair match.

It's definitely an interesting and complex issue."
46,"Look, I'll give it to you straight...us beautiful black women are usually more expensive until we go natural then we're only expensive when we re-up on ingredients.

1) Lotion the baby...even if you think the baby doesn't need anymore lotion, lotion it one more time.

2) When the baby's hair grows out, start a youtube account and just wild out on youtube natural haircare videos. If, once the baby's hair grows out, you don't know what to do...open your wallet and pay someone to do it for you.There is no shame in it!  If its a little black boy...find the flyest black man you've seen in a while and ask him who is barber is...then take your child to that barber. There is only shame in having your daughter/son looking crazy.

Things that stand out: Moisture is the special ingredient to black girl/boy magic. Our hair needs moisture, our skin needs moisture, our bodies need moisture! They were lucky enough to adopt/be raising this child during a strong revival of the natural hair movement so the internet is just flush with natural hair care and body care topics. They need to become acquainted with youtube."
47,"I am very concerned about the state of the Supreme Court. I fear that Obama's nominee will not get confirmed and that Trump will get to make that appointment. The conservative Supreme Court we've had for the last few decades has been responsible for Citizens United and the gutting of the Voting Rights Act. The conservative court has also been responsible for numerous decisions that weaken the rights of employees and consumers when dealing with large corporations. In the next four to eight years, we can expect that Ruth Bader Ginsburg (age 83) and Anthony Kennedy (age 79) will both retire. Stephen Breyer (age 77) might also retire. We do not want a radical, right-wing Republican, but especially not Donald Trump, making the appointments to the US Supreme Court. If Trump wins, the US might as well kiss a progressive, egalitarian future good-bye."
48,"They're expensive, smelly, and require vast amounts of time and attention. If you have one -- or heaven forfend, multiples -- kiss a lot of the nicer things in your life goodbye: furniture, shoes, ""whenever"" sex, disposable income, sleeping comfortably. You're beholden to their eating, sleeping, and elimination habits. Every meal you eat, you'll either have to share or feel guilty about. 

...Come to think of it, it's pretty much the same list as the list of reasons why I never had kids. "
49,"My brother owns his own business. His wife was doing the accounting and I had the suspicion that she was stealing from it. I asked my brother to let me look at the books, showed him the evidence, he fired her and got a divorce. She had stolen over $100,000 in just one year. She claims I am a bad person and have ruined her life and I'm the reason she is broke now. Yeah, I'm the bad one because I refuse to allow her to steal anything else from him."
50,"This actually really makes me want to go to a Pride event, to stand in solidarity with the community. I rarely attend Pride because, as a bisexual woman, I often feel unwelcome and excluded in queer spaces, but right now I really want to feel more a part of my community."
51,"I was adopted from India when I was 6. I just want to say I absolutely love my mother and the opportunities she gave me. If I was still in India, I do not think I would even be alive. I'm moments away from graduating college and am just so grateful for her and all that I have. If you have the ability to adopt, you should. "
52,"I have this weird fantasy of being a pimp.

I'd make sure my ladies and gentlemen were always healthy and in safe environments. They'd get free STD and health checks frequently. Our clients would be background checked beforehand (so my babes don't end up dead or something). I'd use my riches to buy a mansion that is a safe haven for my babes and they can stay there as long as they need/want. And nobody would be forced into anything. We'd also have an on-site therapist for my babes. Also I'd wear a big purple zebra print hat with feathers.

But of course that's insane. And a little illegal...

Edit: TIL a lot of you weirdos support this. I love you all."
53,I'd love to be the person who decorates the show rooms in IKEA. 
54,"I flirt with everyone, and if they flirt back I take it as a sign. Usually straight girls pull out really early and just say they're straight.  

In other words, I assume everyone is into me until proven otherwise"
55,"Because my boyfriend cheated on me with her.

Yeah, you read that right. She was angry with me and thought I was a terrible person for being with my (then) boyfriend because *she* wanted him.

The mental gymnastics from them both were astounding."
56,When I was 12 my dad's (expletive) ex-girlfriend gave me a Weight Watchers starter kit for my birthday. At my party. In front of my friends and family. It was mortifying. I never had any body dysphoria issues until then. It seriously screwed with me for years. I wasn't even fat!
57,"I personally have not adopted a child, but I was a child who was adopted at the age of 12. I don't know if you would like to hear about it from the other side or not?"
58,"After reading through these responses, I'm incredibly thankful for my open-minded and laid back mother. I can't honestly think of anything strange or controlling that she enforced at home. There were the obvious ""Come home when the street lights come on. Call if you're not going to make it home on time so I know where you are. Wear your helmet when you're biking."" type things but... That's about it?"
59,"Talking about things that happen in my country, when I don't mention I'm not from the US.

Also, I always get downvoted when I talk about how sex trafficking is a very big issue where I live, that many sex workers here aren't doing it because they want to. I was also downvoted for saying strip clubs here are shady as all fuck and many times also work as brothels, sometimes with - you guessed it! - trafficked women and girls. Do people really think this shit doesn't happen? It probably happens in developed countries too."
60,"I think sometimes we forget how hard won Pride really is. People died for the right to March in a pride parade.  People rioted, people were shot People have been disowned by their families, fired from their jobs,  even murdered because they dare identify as Lgbtq+.  

Pride isn't about pretty boys wearing nothing but a loin cloth dancing.  It's about the other 364 days where you glance over your shoulder before you take your partners hand because you've tasted pavement before and you have no desire to do it again.  

So yes I'm going to pride but it's the things you do the rest of the year that really makes the difference. "
61,My mom was a hardcore drug addict and we regularly saw her shooting up heroin. BUT we weren't allowed to watch the Simpsons or Beavis and Butthead. 
62,"For the the shape of my eyebrows. He said I was arrogant because obviously I was always plucking them. Which I wasn't, they just grow like that"
63,Free a young black kid in prison for weed possession and replace him with Brock Turner
64,"Not wanting to be more than friends, and subsequently getting sexually assaulted. Apparently that made me a bad person.

This all happened when I was ~16. At one time T and I were great friends, best friends even - but there was this constant undertone of 'unrequited desire' that kept rearing up and making the friendship extremely frustrating. He would make advances, I would maintain that I just wanted to be friends.

When I told him I needed space from him, he turned up at my parents' house with flowers. I again asked him to give me space, and the next day he turned up sat in the car with my Dad who was collecting me from work. He'd given my Dad this sob story about needing to talk to me, that he had some important things he needed to say and I was dodging him. You can imagine how weird that car journey was.

I told my Dad afterwards that I was worried T was getting too much, and told him I wasn't comfortable with his advances. My Dad apologised for allowing him in the car, but he had apparently walked all the way to their house from the other side of the city (?!) and he felt sorry for him.

I cut ties with T after that. A few months later he reached out to me and I stupidly agreed to try being friends again. I went to his parents' house and we were chilling watching TV and eating, when he started asking me really private questions about myself, my sex life, whether I shave...then he started pushing me to show him my body. I was really uncomfortable at this point and wanted to leave, but he would not stop pushing - bringing out every reason, complaint, plea you can imagine.

Long story short, he assaulted me in that room. I called my Dad sobbing and he rushed over to get me, I was sat outside on the front step feeling completely lost and betrayed.

We shared the same large circle of friends at the time, and they all took his side, insisting I had always led him on and I deserved to feel ashamed. That he was in his right to touch me because I'd 'led him on for years', and that I had 'bewitched him' and played him for my own benefit.

Safe to say I lost a lot of friends that day.

I really needed to share that...I carry it around with me a lot of the time and I've never really shared it with anyone before."
65,"It's dismissive. And inaccurate.

I think a lot of it comes from the social acceptance of physical closeness in female friendships. It is considered acceptable for girls to do thinks like dance closely with each other or for teens to have sleepovers and sleep in the same bed. From my experiences, it is not considered ""acceptable"" for boys to do the same. Because society is more accepting of ""closeness"" in female friendships, the perceived potential ""non straightness"" is a self fulfilling prophecy."
66,"I like being unattached. 


Allowing myself to feel vulnerable and sacrificing my sense of security is tough. "
67,"My only thoughts are that it's completely horrible, and it's tough not to feel helpless.

Actually, I have another thought.  Mr. Rogers is right:

*""My mother would say to me, 'Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.' To this day, especially in times of disaster, I remember my mother's words, and I am always comforted by realizing that there are still so many helpers — so many caring people in this world.""*

"
68,I have a beauty mark right next to my butthole.  It's been confused for poo :(
69,He has an inability to whisper.
70,"When my daughter was about three she wanted something in the grocery store, but refused to say please.  I didn't give it to her anyway and for this I was called a bad parent.

This is frustrating because there are so many *valid* reasons why I'm a bad parent."
71,This is the sweetest thing I've read all day.
72,"I've never *used* it incorrectly as it's not the kind of thing that comes up in casual conversation, but I always vaguely had an impression that a kumquat was some kind of small tropical mammal, like a fat little tree shrew or something. Then when I was about 14, I saw a bottle of kumquat-scented shampoo and I quietly asked Jeeves what a kumquat actually was."
73,This is really funny
74,"Morena Baccarin.  She is just incredibly lovely. I've always been stunned by her grace, on top of her obvious physical beauty. "
75,I fart really loud
76,"When I broke up with my abusive ex fiancé, I lost loads of weight (through stress, but whatever), got a whole new wardrobe (because I needed it after the weight loss), got a new haircut, got the tattoo I wanted (that my ex said would make me look like a man), changed career, got a great job, almost doubled my salary, got several promotions, bought myself a car and a piano (he hated me having hobbies), took up dancing and got a mortgage by myself on a house in London. 
He got unemployed and a horrendous haircut so awful that when I bumped into him I actually couldn't help doubling over with laughter. "
77,Phoebe on Friends called it the sexy phlegm voice. 
78,"Okay. I did grow up with my parents and their rules and how they structured the house, which would be different from a child from foster care. When I first moved in with my adoptive mother (she was taking this on all by herself) I was very hesitant to do anything. I was afraid to touch anything in the house, to get food when I was hungry, or to even ask questions. She really helped with my adjustment period by telling me it was okay to do this or to not do that (I went from living in the middle of a city to out in the country; it's amazing the differences in how to do even the simplest of things). Middle school was a blur, I remember not having many problem between me and my adoptive mother; however, that changed in high school. I became really ""rebellious"" as a teenager and was quite hard headed about wanting to have a life like I had with my birth parents again. This made things difficult, and of course as the child I didn't agree with how my adoptive mother handled certain situations. As an adult now I understand why she did the things she did. 

If you have an specific questions about anything, I'm all open to answer."
79,"There were a lot of rules about what I was allowed to wear and when. I never got to do the typical (pre)teen thing of trying out different makeup and clothes as a way of trying out identities because I got so much pushback. Generally, if she didn't approve she wouldn't buy it, and if I found a way to experiment with the approved clothes then the rules changed.

But the weirdest rule to me was always my curfew. My mom had been a wild child and a runaway as a teen, so she let me know when I was 13 that my curfew was always going to be *midnight*.

But, I wasn't a wild child. Other than all girl sleepovers, I didn't go anywhere after 9 PM. After a few years of that, my mom started trying to tempt me out, pushing my curfew back to 1 AM, 2 AM, and finally it changed to **no curfew**... but I still never went out at all.

Finally, my senior year, I went out to see a friend's band play. My mom drove us to the show, and then we called her a couple hours later and let her know we'd be riding to the afterparty with friends.

Then, around 12:30, I checked my phone to find around 8 missed calls from my mother, *flipping her shit* that I wasn't home and it was past my curfew (which, again, I didn't have). Since I didn't drive, I had to go around and find a friend willing to leave the party and drive me home, and that was how my one attempt at attending a real high school party went - I got to hang out with people for about 30 minutes, with no alcohol, and then I had to beg a guy I barely new for a ride back to my house because my mom had suddenly changed the rules again."

81,There's just something about Rachel McAdams that makes me drawn to her. She's gorgeous!

As far as trans women in general competing against cis women goes, I'm all in favor. Obviously I have a stake in this argument, but I can say with perfect honesty that after a few years of HRT, the strength advantages of previously having male anatomy are *gone without a trace*. The playing field is quite level. (It's quite shocking, really. I was athletic before transition, through it, and afterwards, and even years on, I still boggle at how physically weak I have become and how hard it is to maintain or build strength and endurance. Testosterone is a hell of a drug.) I have competed in a few different sports post-transition, and my scores, times, and such are commensurate with my peers."

She never told me it was okay to change my mind about religion, or that if I wanted she'd buy me a new prom dress instead of the thrift store one, and she certainly never hit me or screamed at me or called me horrible names like all those times I remember.

127,"My husband and I adopted a sibling group from foster care ten years ago. The oldest at the time was 5 1/2. The others were 2, 3, and 4. I can tell you that the first year is very rough. When you get them the love isn't instant, and at times you will not even like them very much (and they won't like you, either). I used to keep a chair in my closet so I could have a private place to cry, which I did every day. Things slowly got better after the first year, and we could not love them any more if they were our bio kids. Now they are all teenagers, and at times I wonder what the fuck I was thinking, just like my friends with bio teenage kids.

My advice to you if you decide to do it: Find a good counselor with experience in older adoption and bonding issues. They will be an invaluable resource.
    
 Know that it isn't going to go like you think it is; your child will be entirely different than the kid you read about in the case file once he or she settles in. My 'shy' child became my most outgoing, and my 'aggressive' child my most loving and gentle. 
     
Know that at times you will feel lonely and isolated from parents with bio kids, and at times your child's behavior will be confusing and troubling. Find other parents in similar circumstances for support. As much as they try, most people with bio kids will be horrified when you tell them about your child's circumstances, and will think of your child as damaged goods.  And that leads me to my last piece of advice: Do not overshare your child's history. People will judge her for her past. 

Edit: All in all, I would definitely do it again, and the reward of seeing neglected and terrified children blossom into happy and confident kids is sooo worth it. "

130,"Most crime in general is committed by men. So nothing new really. The only king of murder women commit almost as often as men is killing their families. 

I studied criminology in grad school so I can be a bit wonky on this, but it's really easier to look at it from the perspective of why don't women commit crime as much. Those reasons range from women not having the time or means to commit crime because they were tied to their homes and families (historically speaking), because women are socialized to deal with problems differently than men are (it's ok for men to be violent, etc), social pressures on men and women have historically been different with men being the ""protectors"" and ""bread winners"" so when 'strain' (social or economical) is introduced it's men that resort to crime in response, etc, etc. As women become equal to men and have access to the same opportunity and freedoms who see them increasingly committing the same crimes men do. Though I think it would be a long, long while before they reach the same levels. "
131,"We were on our way to go for a hike and got lost on the drive there (1 hour became 3), his car was on E, and our phones died. In the middle of nowhere. We got to where we thought we were supposed to be, couldn't find the trail after walking about an hour, got back to the car and....he locked his keys in the car. Reminder, our phones are dead. He had to throw a huge rock at his window to break it and get to the keys.

It's dark out at this point, we go to drive off, terrified that his car was going to run out of gas, and he ran over his backpack that he left outside. At this point I just couldn't stop laughing at our lives (while he was quite obviously pissed off), so we just parked the car and made out for a little bit even though we were certain we would die at this point. We didn't have GPS or anything so we had to pull over to someone's random house in the middle of nowhere (eek) and ask how to get to the nearest gas station. I thought the kid would never talk to me again after this date and he later admitted the same thing to me.

TL;DR: Bride wanted a Tupac style hologram of her father at the wedding.


I work in event management but more on the concert side of things, although we do all kind of events like debutante balls and graduations and corporate functions too. We work closely with a couple of wedding planners who sometimes sub-hire our equipment etc. 

Anyways, one day I am sent to a client meeting with the wedding planner to help plan things on our end. It's usually a speaker system, some lights for the dance floor sometimes helping with a band or a string quartet etc.

So this bride says to me, with sadness in her voice, that her father has recently passed away and that it was very upsetting he wouldn't be able to walk her down the aisle or do the father/ daughter dance with her. I can sympathize, and it's unfortunately not unusual to hear these kind of stories. She's talking about how her mum could walk her down the isle, or an uncle, but it wouldn't be the same. I'm sort of nodding along with her, not sure where she's heading.

Then she looks me right in the eyes and says 'So what I'd really like to do is get a hologram, you know, like Tupac.'
My first thought was 'Ok, she's about to follow this up with the real question, smile politely.'
So I did.
And she was just looking back and forth from me, to the wedding planner. Raising her eyebrows and enthusiastically nodding.

The wedding planner just kind of looked at me and said 'um...' and I could feel her searching for the words. I helped her out.

'Well, holograms are VERY complicated technology. It's not really something that's possible for this kind of application. If you had a home video you wanted us to project on a wall at the reception or something...'

She interrupts me.
'No like, I want him to walk me down the aisle. I want to do the daddy daughter dance with him.' She keeps looking me right in the eyes. She's not getting it. I'm trying to say it politely but I don't think she actually understands how holograms work.

I spend probably half an hour explaining about how complicated it is to create an image to project as a hologram, and how much expensive equipment is involved, and how long it would take to achieve something like that. She pulls her phone out on more than one occasion to show me the hologram videos of MJ and Tupac as if I'm the one who doesn't understand. I keep repeating, trying to be polite, that I know what she's referring to but that's not achievable in a wedding environment and the cost (even if it were possible) would be astronomical etc. after a while the wedding planner sees I'm getting flustered and tries to back me up but it doesn't help. This woman is also starting to get upset because obviously it's something she really wanted and it never crossed her mind how ridiculous it was. I offered all the alternatives I could think of but nothing was good enough. In the end I just sighed and said 'Well I'm really sorry but this just isn't something that can be done. I don't know how else to communicate that.' And I sort of lean back from the table hoping she understands my body language.

She's kind of looking at the pile of paperwork she has in front of her and she says, completely seriously, 'well I have the name of the company that did Tupac, maybe you can call them?'

No.
No lady I can't.
You are insane.
You're the dumbest person I've ever had to deal with in my 8 years at this job.
Your grief has rendered you mentally incompetent.

I had no choice. I just said 'I'm sorry but we can't do it. It's impossible.'

She finally got the message (or at least decided to move on) and turned to the wedding planner and started chit-chatting about centerpieces as if we hadn't just had the worlds most idiotic conversation -and I spent the remainder of the meeting essentially staring out of the window."

170,"It's way too close to home from me, I have friends in Orlando and the shooter is from my hometown. Like, his house is 9 minutes away from me. I just can't believe any of this, what a terrible thing to wake up to.

Idk what's going to happen from here. Considering the shooter was Muslim I have a feeling Donald Trump just won Florida. I would hope it would help the argument for stronger gun laws, but if the people who need to care didn't change anything when a bunch of first graders were shot I doubt they're gonna care about gay people. 

Also, it's very frustrating to read Facebook comments on my local news page saying shit like ""thanks Obama for securing our borders!"" THE GUY WAS BORN HERE. "
171,"It can be:

* A self fulfilling prophesy.
* A way to abdicate personal responsibility.
* Panic in the face of other people hitting milestones, or culturally dictated notions of life/age/relationships/gender.
* Self-depreciating humour (Like, *hyyyypothetically* you bring a cardboard cutout to your sister's wedding. Hypothetically.)
* The expression of genuine and not insignificant struggles for which platitudes are frustrating and unhelpful."

"
183,"OOOH! I worked in the wedding industry at a tuxedo shop for 10+ years. I've seen some shit! Some notable weddings:

* Groom was a recovering alcoholic; bride insisted on an open bar.

* As they were booking tuxedos, there was a very obvious and awkward discussion of children - he mentioned that [boss's name] would be cute for a son, she was like ""children?! I don't want that!"" Unbelievable.

* A couple that seethed resentment, anger, and rudeness. Remember the couple that shared a birthing suite with Ross and Rachel, and had some choice names for each other?? Yeah. That.

* The groom that kept saying in a non-joking way that she was ""making him get married."" She thought it was a cute joke, it did not seem that way to me or my coworkers

* The bridesmaid that continually was hitting on me. I was flattered, but, alas, am not gay

* The couple that wanted a bucks-deluxe wedding for under $5K (in ~2000). They did NOT like when I pointed out the constraints on that budget for their expectations

* The bride that was ~5 months along and didn't fit into her chosen gown, but wouldn't acknowledge the bump or concede on changing the gown, insisting that we alter it more. That was a tough one to navigate.

* The couple that didn't want food at their wedding, which was an all-day event. Just wanted cake and punch from 2PM-10PM. Eek.

190,"If you're dating a guy, you're straight. If you're dating a woman, you're gay. If you dated a man but then later dated a woman, you were gay the whole time and none of your relationships previous to the one that apparently made you gay meant anything. If you then date a guy again, you were straight the whole time but had a phase. 

Basically, bisexuality doesn't exist except for sometimes villains. Even then it's used for manipulation. "

192,"STOP ""strong black women""-ing black women.

Black females are stereotyped as difficult, angry, combative, masculine. The ""positive"" side to that stereotype is that black females are independent, perpetually confident and unshakeable to the point we ""can't"" be vulnerable like other women. Our worries are not seen as equally understandable, deserving of as much TLC, or offers for a helping hand, because we ""should"" be able to handle it on our own.

200,Presence over presents.
201,It is known
202,"Non-American here.

**1.  Worried that all the good work Obama has done for climate change will be chucked in the bin.**  
I'm a farmer and Agriculture has been proven to be one of the leading causes of pollution in many countries. Obama got many countries to sign on at his climate change summit which was definitely needed.   
If America re-negs on this - if they continue to let Agriculture proceed unchecked by environmental policies, the rest of the world will suffer as a result.  
To decrease Agricultural pollution, some serious R&amp;D is needed, which equals some serious funding. Currently we are all on an even(ish) economic footing as we have all agreed to work towards decreasing Agricultural emissions. If America re-negs they will get an economic advantage, they will win global trade price competitions as there agricultural industry is not funding environmental R&amp;D so they can supply food cheaper. The whole thing will fall apart, just like the Kyoto protocol did when America dropped out.

**2. Worried about your women.**  
Many gender inequality things seem to be going on in America at the moment. 
 
* The abortion debate seems to surreal to me, the closing down of PPs insane. Women are losing their rights, not gaining them. Doctors are the experts, not politicians. If a doctor deems a procedure necessary, how can a politician come along and rule against a doctor? You are going backwards, this was all debated and settled many decades ago. Donald Trump can only make this worse. Even if he is only ""playing a part"" to get votes, what's he going to tell all the crazies that voted for him, ""Nah, I'm not going there."" - like hell!  

* The ridiculous punishments for rape, and the people who stand up for the rapists. An ongoing issue that I can't see Trump helping with his misogynistic views.

**3. Worried about your people's health.**  
For a long time America has been lacking a national health service, something that nearly all other western countries have managed to develop. Americans have died because they can't afford health care. The amount of corruption within the US health service seems absurd, ie the markups on products and services etc. Obama finally started something, that could eventually develop into something good, and Trump wants to take it away.

Those are my three main concerns anyway. There are many, many more."

204,"When I was about 10, I heard the song Abortion is murder by P.O.D. at my friend's house. I didn't really know what abortion was, but I assumed it was true since they sang it. So when I came home that day, I told my mum, all matter-of-factly that abortion was kind of like murder, hoping she'd be impressed by my new knowledge.

She said that some people think so, and maybe it is, but sometimes it is necessary. She then told me she had an abortion when she was 17, and although it was difficult, it was the right thing to do for her. She also told me that when I got older it might make more sense. I was so incredibly embarrassed, and after that I read up on it and that's pretty much the day I became pro-choice.

I still cringe when I think about it though. "
205,"Not really. Here ""white"" just means ""inexperienced and lacking proper skill"". I'm sure a black mother raising a white child would also want that child to look like she had a mom who was familiar with white hair textures."

207,"I definitely went through most of my twenties (I'm 28) thinking I wouldn't ever find love because my standards were too high/I was unattractive/I'm shy/etc. However, I never let myself be one of those depressed ""foreveralone"" kind of people. Whatever romantic void I felt I had in my life, I filled it with other things - ballroom dancing, volunteering, doing colour runs and tough mudders, learning to fly planes, etc.

A year ago I met and fell in love with a guy who blew my standards out of the water, made me feel gorgeous, and has really helped me come out of my shell and be more comfortable being social. But I think a big part of why my dream-guy was even interested in me was that I had focused on enjoying my life rather than worrying about finding love.

I definitely know how you feel, but just keep doing your thing and don't worry too much about finding The One. If you're busy enough enjoying life, you'll probably just trip over him/her someday when he/she meanders into your life."

215,"When my mom finally gave into letting me shave my legs, I was only allowed to shave up to my knees. Because shaving my upper legs made me a slut? Never figured that one out. After a few months I realized she would never be able to tell the difference and just shaved my whole leg. 

Also, my best friend was raised with a stricter mom than I and one day she showed up to my house with ""freshly shaven"" legs. She had stolen her mom's discarded razor from the trash and dry shaved until her legs looked like a cheese grater had been taken to them. "
216,"That it would kill my libido.  It took a few months after being off birth control for it to start coming back.

The kind of stuff that's great for BBQs, festivals and parties, but most of the time it's too cold or too hot out, or too casual (like work!) to wear any of them.

People love to take it upon themselves to be the disability police and glare at me, leave cruel notes, and confront me to accuse me of faking it because apparently everybody is an expert in all of the possible disabilities/chronic illnesses that exist. This is especially difficult because what's wrong with me is rare, multifaceted, and difficult to explain. Someone in one of my college classes saw that I was sitting in a special chair with a handicap sticker and joked that ""yeah, right haha, you're soooo disabled. As if!"" expecting me to laugh along, and it took everything I had to prevent myself from bursting into tears until class was over and I could hide in the bathroom. All of the old people who tell me to appreciate my good health or berate me are even worse. 

PSA- a lot of people who require handicap placards, wheelchairs, and/or mobility assistance service dogs can fucking walk or even run some of the time! You seeing me exercise with my service dog or stand up out of my wheelchair is not ""proof"" that I'm faking anything. I have good days and bad ones, there are a lot of variables involved, and working out is absolutely mandatory for me unless I want my heart to become even more deconditioned."

Three days before school let out for the summer that year he handed me a copy of Diablo and said he was able to buy an extra copy because I was kind enough to share my lunch with him all those months. We played more hours of Diablo that summer than I can even comprehend as an adult now. I remember several nights where we were playing so late my mom got up for work, I shut off my monitor slipped into bed and pretended to go to sleep till she left, then I hopped up and kept playing. That was a great summer, all thanks to sharing my lunches.

You have two options - '[natural](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/90/d9/82/90d982e3fdbd63d097f2c8f47366f904.jpg)' or '[relaxed](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/1e/59/dd/1e59dd2c6f3c2cdbf908ad5bc52c4f85.jpg)'. I don't recommend the relaxing process for young girls, but good to be aware of it. 

**Washing**

Black hair doesn't behave the same as white hair. It needs a lot more moisture and less washing (once a week or as needed). Conditioner is a must, and leave it on for as long as possible. 

Detangle the hair before and after washing, because black hair 'shrinks' when wet and the curls will get tighter. Detangling is easier when the hair is wet.

You can air-dry the hair, or braid it and wait overnight. I detangle my hair, add serum/oil, wrap it overnight and blow-dry in the morning. 

**Styling**

Minimize the use of heat. Black hair is prone to split ends and breakage - heat accelerates both. 

In the long run, protective styles are best - ones that keep the edges tucked in. There are tons of bun/updo tutorials, and most black hair takes well to being braided. But... kids can rock the 'poof' and it's super cute. 

Don't tug when combing, and black hair doesn't really need brushing, but a boar bristle brush is good for keeping the edges of hair under control.

That's everything off the top of my head. I'm really into hair health, so I'm happy to answer questions!

249,I want a woman president. I want there to be several in the coming decades. Do I agree 100% with Clinton?  Nope. Do I agree 100% with Sanders? Nope. Will I gladly vote for either of them over Trump?  Hell yes. 
250,I know a lot of people claiming it wasn't a hate crime. There's no way this wasn't a hate crime. This person chose to go into a gay bar and target members of the LGBTQ+ community. It's heart breaking. I hate that we live in a world where your identity puts a giant target on your back.

So he shows up at my apartment with roses and a bottle of wine, which for me was extremely awkward.
He then took us to a pub and me being 18 couldnt drink so I had to watch him pound beer after beer. Then we went to a drive in movie, he had a truck so we sat in the back and were cuddling with blankets cause it was chilly. He would not stop trying to finger me. He was relentless, I moved away from him, told him he wasnt going to touch me . He kept trying to put his fingers inside me, and I finally had enough and told him he either drive me home or I was calling my friend to come and get me"
254,"My fiance and I had only been together for about a month but we went on a trip to the Cape together. He was closest to the air conditioner that we left running all night. I woke up to him shivering, curled up next to me. Somehow I stole all the blankets in the middle of the night.

I rolled over towards him and wrapped the blankets around us and rubbed my hand over his arm and back trying to get the goose bumps to go away. He woke up, wrapped his arms around my super tight, kissed my nose and tucked me into his chest and I fell back asleep pretty quickly. 

It was the cutest thing and it just.. clicked? It just made sense in that moment that I loved him. And I haven't stopped loving him since!"

for her sixteenth birthday she wouldn't tell my mum what she wanted. did she want to go somewhere? No! did she want a party? No! all she wanted was a new phone. an expensive one. nothing less would do. Mum told her she wasn't getting a phone. my sister refused to have anything else. my mum still wanted to get her something so we went to the local market together and got her this beautiful range of creamy hand made luxury soap.when we gave them to my sister she had a genuine meltdown.

Afterwards, i went to the bathroom to take a piss and i realised that not only was my fly undone, but my dong was sticking out of the holes in between the buttons of my boxers and out in plain sight.

When i got back, a family friend said 'dont worry, it happens'. I spent the whole of the rest of nmthe night sitting in the corner sipping on apple juice.

I guess that was an unfortunate mishap for my uncle.

Also, the wedding video got sent out and i could see my dong, so i'm wishing nobody saw it"

275,"This is exactly how I feel! I went to Pride in high school (before I realized I was bisexual) and was quite involved in my po dunk high school's GSA chapter; however, as an ""adult,"" I haven't really done much in the LGBT community, mostly because I don't necessarily feel like I belong, given that I'm a bisexual woman in a long-term relationship with a man, so I'm passable as straight. 

I feel like I should go to Pride this year. Because, in theory, it shouldn't matter that I don't look ""traditionally queer"" (whatever the fuck that means) and it shouldn't matter that I'm currently in a relationship with a dude; that doesn't change the fact that I am, in fact, a bisexual woman. "

297,"So, my ex-wife and i took an old dog from a friend who's mom had died and left three dogs (she took the other two).  He ended up dying a few weeks later (he was 14 years old i think), but i wouldn't trade those few weeks for anything.   His last couple of days he could barely walk, and my beagle was propping him up and nudging him along with her nose.  I still choke up thinking about that.

After he passed we ended up adopting another dog who ended up being one of the sweetest dogs ever (my ex now has him).  I had already had a dog for few years so i never wouldve thought to get a second dog had we not had to take one to help out a friend.  But because we took him, and my dog missed him after he passed, we ended up adopting another wonderful dog.  

I would definitely take another older dog again.  Theyre great. "
298,"Right, but just like professional athletes can't take steroids, this has the potential to put her at an unfair advantage. I don't know enough about the science to judge whether it does or not, that's just the argument. I think transwomen are women, that's not the argument. It's whether it gives them an athletic advantage, thereby making it unfair for them to compete against ciswomen."
299,"To me the question is as crazy as ""How do you feel about having a president who's 6 ft tall?"" 

Height is immaterial, so is gender, and I don't even feel I need to qualify that with ""as long as she's the best one for the job"" (as all the comments in AskMen seem to be doing). 

Unfortunately it's very rare you get a presidential candidate that's literally the best person in the whole country for the job. These people have voted for male presidents who certainly weren't. It seems the standard for a male president is ""best of the choices available"" but for a female president it's ""best person for the job"", which for many is just their way of justifying not voting for Hillary because Bernie lost."

It reminds me of my parents saying that when I was a kid. It guarantees my face will turn bright red and I get this awful grimace on my face cause now I'm pretending to not be embarrassed. Its awful. I'm not shy, I'm just a listener. His mom does the same thing to me, too. They're both very chatty and they think if someone isn't talkative that they're shy.

I was one of 2 female trainers we had on staff there which meant I had to occasionally be put into the ring as a sparring partner or punching dummy or whatnot.  Nothing ever competition wise, but just for practice.  Well, I could and would occasionally get a few of the guys down on the mat.  Do I think that was because I was stronger or faster than them?  Nope, it was because I have been doing this for almost 20 fucking years and have seen more than them.  

And yet, I still would not want to go up against the majority of men in a straight fight.  For me, it takes skill and hyper awareness to win.  It takes them getting one lucky punch.  "

My mother was similar except she believes only people who have had sex are able to use tampons. If you are a virgin its impossible for it to go in. When I was 16 she asked me about her missing tampons, and if my brothers girlfriend had been taking some. I had heard her musings on what being able to use a tampon meant, but didn't think she was actually dumb enough to believe that. So I shrugged and said,


""I am.""

314,"So many decisions are made at the state level, though. A Trump presidency indicates Trump support. Trump supporters may try harder to push legislation through in their own state, and Trump won't do shit about it.

Well, he met a girl fell in love, and married her. I was super excited for him! He asked me to be one of his ""groomsmen"" (groomspeople?). His fiancé at the time didn't talk much to me, but she seemed mostly neutral to my presence. Not long after the wedding though, the claws came out. And one day she confronted me, told me how inappropriate it was for a single girl like me to be friends with a married man, and how I was obviously trying to steal her husband from her, and how only a low-life scumbag would act like that, etc. Yeah...she's not my favorite person. And my friend is playing Switzerland in this, saying he doesn't want to get involved. So I just avoid her. But our friendship has definitely suffered for it. "

I texted my date that I was there, but didn't hear back right away. Fine, I'll get a drink and relax for a minute. So while I waited for my drink this couple next to me starts making out aggressively. I mean like horizontal on the bar stool. So horizontal that the woman ended up with her head on my shoulder mid slobber fest. People were starting to stare and I was getting super uncomfortable, so I thought I'd try to reach out again, I text my date asking him to please rescue me from the obnoxious couple making out next to me, but no text back. I figured I would give it another few minutes before I decided to bail. A couple minutes later the making out stops and I get a text back saying ""oh shit! That was actually me, but if you come over to the restroom I'll explain"". I flagged down the bartender as quickly as I could to sign out my tab, but right as I was walking away he came up and tried to explain that his behavior was okay because they were old friends.

Like I'll wait for him around a corner and jump out and say boo and he'll meow at me or make that chirping noise and then like five minutes or less later he'll come jumping around a corner meowing at me. It's really funny. We play hide and go seek a lot.

That's not to say that there aren't other problems.  There is a whole litany of of social problems that need to be addressed but guns are the tool through which a lot of these issues get expressed.  Take that tool away and lives will be saved.  It's not a maybe, it's a fact.

But she is so wonderful I can't even put it into words. She sleeps 20 hours a day, and is content to do so. We both work and are out of the house for 10+ hours, so a neighborhood girl comes over to take her for a little walk around lunchtime.

I am also afraid of any brash actions foreign affair related. I do not want to declare war on ISIS and I want to come back from the middle east and let them be. 

I am afraid of his view on encryption laws and net neutrality. He is strongly against net neutrality which is a huge problem for me. 

Lastly I am afraid Trump will act the same way he did in hiss bussiness. As long as he comes out on top, fuck what happens to everyone else.

378,"Are you planning to do a national or international adoption? This is rather important given the conditions of some of the orphanages in most developing countries with severe attachment deficiencies; and as the other therapist in the thread might corroborate, the first couple of years (or even the first few months) of a child's life are absolutely decisive for their mental health.

I'm absolutely biased in that due to my profession I deal with  the adoptions that go seriously wrong rather than those that go OK, but these are things that you need to keep in mind. 

On a more abstracted note, I guess it also boils down to your reasons for wanting to adopt. If your aim is to provide the kid with as good a life as they'll be able to have despite whatever happens, then that's extremely generous; but if you're expecting to have a ""normal"" family, that'll be much harder to achieve with an older child adoption, but I'll let the therapist specialised in that talk about it, as I'm not specialised in child development."

396,"Oh man. When I was 15 I was in an online fan club for a singer I really liked. I'd become friends with a couple of the women in charge, one of whom was 36 years old.

One day she and I were talking about pets and I mentioned something like, ""Oh, my last cat got really sick and my dad had to shoot it."" This woman started loosing her shit accusing me and my family of being horrible animal torturers.

I tried several times to explain that a) we live in a rural area and these are semi-feral barn cats b) my family is poor and the one time we had a cat euthanized by the vet it cost over $100 and c) the animal was suffering and dying slowly, so a shot to the head was probably a better way to go.

But this lady was not having it. She called me and my dad both **monsters** for not taking every animal on our property to a vet to be professionally euthanized and disposed of when they got seriously ill or injured. 

As an adult, I understand that people can get very upset by this idea, but as a kid it was just normal to me... and I really don't think there's any excuse for a grown-ass woman to go around telling 15 year old kids that they're ""soulless monsters""."

*No bikini's, no way in hell, as long as you live with me.

*Reuse your paper towels as much as possible to save money.

*Use only a quarter of the recommended laundry detergent per load to save money.

Then I watched it and it was just... horrible. Sure, it presented the women in it as fallible, great. Except they're also all terrible and unlikeable. Fallible and real =/= terrible and unlikeable. I also felt basically offended that these characters were meant to represent my generation. What the fuck."

406,"Nah.  I'm in my 40s, and when I was a kid, there was no way it was ok for someone to be out and gay in my hometown; now it is.  They still hear slurs and idiots, but I know gay schoolteachers and office workers and mechanics, and *they can do that*.  They couldn't, or at least didn't, when I was a kid.  

When I was a kid, the idea of a woman running for president was a *joke*.  *The US has had a black president.*  That is *mindblowing* to me, as a person who grew up in the 1970s.  I legitimately didn't believe I would ever see either of those things happen in my lifetime.  And now ... we have.    

When I was a kid, it was commonplace to just throw trash out your window on a roadtrip.  Seriously.  Just wad up your fast food trash and throw it out the window, figuring it would biodegrade at some point.  That's *unthinkable* now.  They used to issue smog warnings in major US cities because the air was too nasty to breathe, and joggers were keeling over from the pollution.  The Thames in London was pronounced ""dead"" at one point because the pollution in it was so bad that nothing could live in it; now fish have come back.  

If you're young, you don't know how bad it used to be, so it's hard to see how far we've come.  Yeah, we hear about the crappy stuff every day, because that's what the news does.  The ""getting better"" stuff is all tiny little incremental stuff that's hard to report on and not that interesting to watch.  But it's there.  

The world is so much safer, and wierder, and more interesting than I ever thought it was when I was a kid or a teenager.  My life has contained so much more adventure than I thought it would -- I figured that all the really interesting bits would be over in my mid-20s.  Thank heavens I was wrong."

* I was not allowed in people's backyards or someone would steal my bike (and she drove around the neighborhood watching for this, something other kids noticed, and would take it and put it in the garage to make me think it had been stolen if I left it unattended)
* I was not allowed to pick out my own outfits straight through high school
* I was not allowed to cut my hair till I was 18
* I was not allowed to spend my own money, so as to remain entirely dependent upon her.
* I was not allowed to use any tampons except the O.B. applicator-less ones. WHY.
* I was not allowed to use public bathrooms, even at school. We went back to the hotel from Disney World because I had to pee. She still talks about how I ""ruined"" that trip, too, because I had an ear ache from molars coming in. This led directly to:
* We only ever went to Vegas on vacation, because I would ""ruin"" all other trips for her. 
* I was not allowed to walk up or down the stairs because I would trip and die until junior high.
* There were no sleepovers.
* I didn't have a curfew, but I should just ""know when to be home.""
* As a kid, however, I had to return home every hour to check in or she would call the police.
* If I went out with people that they did not approve of, my grandmother would call the cops and report my car stolen.
* If I went to college close to home they would visit every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday to ensure I was not drinking or having sex. I went to college over 500 miles away (IN STATE! WHOO!)
* We followed the age recommendations on movies, but she didn't know how old ""PG"" was, so I didn't watch those till I was 13 much either. However I could read whatever the hell I wanted, and proceeded to read my way through the adult section of the library starting at 8.
* If she read a story I was writing and she didn't like where the plot was going I had to change it. I stopped letting her read stuff and started storing it on the computer.

My hair has never been healthier, and my springy little coils are cute, and so me! I get asked often what I do to my hair to make it curl like this, but the answer is almost nothing!

410,"What a different atmosphere to last year. Almost exactly a year ago, I realised I was gay. A few days later gay marriage was legalised across the USA. I went to my first Pride that same day and it was such a celebration. Facebook was flooded with rainbows. I really felt like things were changing, the world was celebrating with us, and that it was okay to be gay, after a lifetime of denial. Happy tears all month.

Last year London had banners saying ""Congratulations USA!"". This year, we will have vigils for Orlando, tonight and at Pride. I don't feel like it's okay to be gay, not in the eyes of many people. Not in the eyes of extremists, or the many, many homophobic internet commenters I've seen, the ilks of which I probably pass on the street every day without knowing. 

Instead of celebration, this year is about solidarity with the victims, and proving that we won't be silenced. "

Whenever people make statements like that there are no straight women it's always been in a gross way.  If someone says there are no straight people, talks about Kinsey Institute research, etc, I'm usually willing to listen.  But when women are talked about it's because people assume women are wrong about their own sexuality or attractions, or 'everyone' is attracted to women or something.  Lies."
