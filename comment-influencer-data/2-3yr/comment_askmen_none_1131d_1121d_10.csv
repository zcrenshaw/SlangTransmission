"""By the way hun, I don't actually use the alarm clock to wake up, I just press the snooze button over and over again until it's five minutes before I have to be out the door."""

"That my version of clean, and her version of clean...are completely different things."
"It would make my fucking month. It's not really standard for ladies to compliment or flirt with a guy unprompted, so it's pretty easy for me to convince myself that I'm basically invisible."
I like to extend my arm with my palm facing downward to create a path for the water to flow down from my shoulder and shoot off of my finger tips. At the right angle you can actually get some decent projectile motion so I like to pretend I can shoot water from my fingers.
I do computer science at university. I'm lucky to see a woman.

Are you for real."
Did she also wear progressively nicer dresses to church and sit closer and closer to the front every week until one day you realized you were at your own wedding? 
"Personally, I don't want to be the sole financial ""breadwinner"". Obviously if it comes down to me taking the lion's share of the burden, I'm willing to put in the effort to keep us afloat, but if I were to have a career setback or jump, I would expect my wife, who I see as an equal partner in this arrangement, to then take up the mantle. "
"When my husband and and I would shower together, I would take a bath poofy and scrub his armpits. He would hold up his arm and I'd start scrubbing with lots of soap saying ""STINKYSTINKYSTINKYSTINKY"" really fast. And we'd always giggle. He passed away a few months ago. So now sometimes I'll still say it when I shower alone. "
Lets just say i can remember every person who has complimented me based on looks within the past 2-3 years. It means a lot.
Fucking hair... Everywhere...

"Make sure to have your own life outside of the relationship. Don't neglect your friends, keep hobbies and interests that your girlfriend doesn't share. You don't have to have everything in common or do everything together. Being too clingy and spending every moment together isn't good. Your girlfriend is important, but for a healthy relationship to last you have to be happy with yourself and have your own individual life. "
"""I don't like the way things turned out Tuesday night, we should try again""

Then hopefully he'll ask you out or whatever"
"No, that's weird. You took it too far. "
Wow. Feeling like a huge gaping asshole right now. So sorry for your loss.
"That we'd never be sharing a bed. 
I understand his point that we both move around a lot but I get super lonely at night ..."
"Here's an idea. If you want to be with him, just let him know you are interested and move forward. If you don't want to be with him, leave it alone. 

Honesty and directness, go figure. "
Sounds like she's not the perfect woman in that case 😅
"The thing that never shows up in Porn is when it goes wrong.  The times when I get a leg cramp just before I am about to come or when she is stressed and just dries up or when my mind goes ""look there's a squirrel"" and my bones goes away mid bonk.  Sometimes it just isn't working.  We will stop and cuddle for a while and decide whether or not to get back to it.  

Oh and the minor fact that at 53, ain't nobody except us want to see us naked.  

That said,  the other thing that is rarely portrayed is two people making love who have a deep connection and know exactly how to turn each other on.  Of making love where the purpose is to deepen that connection and the sex is simply an pleasant side benefit.  

And time.  Not unusual for my wife to spend an entire day together.  Reading to each other,  talking,  relaxing,  perhaps a picnic in bed.  Somewhere in there,  sex happens, slow luxurious sex with orgasm not at all the goal until it is.  maybe followed by drifting into a nap.  Then maybe more sex or maybe a movie.  In other words,  the most boring Porn in the world.  But what a great way to spend with the woman I love. "
Mod approved shitposting.
"That she would be a total slob, put on 60lbs, and get laid off and not try to find a new job."
"Yeah, I don't get this one... I'll sleep with my boxers on, wake up, make breakfast, and then have a shower, and then find a strand of her hair tied around my balls and junk in an intricate pattern like it was weaved by an African carpet weaver.
"
"Real sex doesn't always involve two incredibly attractive people having a 75 minute long sex marathon (including unprotected oral, vaginal, and anal sex) and ending with the girl begging for a facial all because someone didn't have enough money to pay for their pizza."
"Married woman here... We are both high libido (thank you paragard!!!) so it doesn't take much for me, but my husband is really good at regular spontaneous displays of desire and affection. 

*He'll randomly get my attention and tell me how sexy/hot/gorgeous I am. Genuine compliments.

*He'll smack, grab or rub my ass at almost every opportunity. Sometimes with a sexy growl of appreciation.

*He'll come up behind me, pull my hair to the side and start kissing/nibbling my neck and grabs my hips/waist and if he can tell I'm turned on he'll sometimes take it a step further and slip a hand into my pants or shirt to feel me up.

*If we're both just chilling on our phones or whatever, he'll tell me to come make out with him or will come to me and start kissing me, and rubbing my head or neck or shoulders.

*being assertive about what he wants from me or what he's going to do to me later.

Basically just giving me consistent reminders that he's really into me and loves me, and does it without pressure to do more and usually it's not a good time to do it right then and there anyway, but it plants the seed and keeps me in the mindset of feeling sexy and wanted. All that said, when my libido was low, some of this was almost annoying and I needed a much more subtle, gradual buildup of desire starting with the mental seduction."
"WTF, Mr Krabs doesn't even flip patties, that's Spongebob's job. Bish doesn't even know the show, no wonder you feel violated"
"I'm admittedly a little biased, because the premise that they exist is fascinating to me...but I think us being entirely alone in the infinite universe is more overwhelming.  "
"&gt;&gt;What cringe-worthy things have you done after a breakup?

&gt;Made a username about how much I miss her"
"Dude, these answers suck. 

Your nerves got you. It happens some sometimes. It can be overwhelming when you're with a new girl who's very attractive. 

Some dudes can't get hard.

Some dudes blow before they get started. (Be glad this isn't your problem.)

Some dudes get nauseated to the point they have to stop or throw up.

Some dudes can get it up but can't cum. This is what happens so to me. 

Just tell you partner that while she does make this happen, it's because you really like her and your brain/dick/body panics."

"Yeah it's the overweight thing that seems to be the biggest problem, imo. I'm just not attracted to people who aren't a healthy weight (and there's nothing wrong with that personal opinion), and at least in the US, so many people are god damn huge these days and it just gets worse and worse the older I get. I'm pretty broad in what I find attractive as far as faces go, but god damn, it would be nice if people weren't soo... squishy.

BUT, that's only the kind of expectation that goes both ways, imo, so if I'm fat, I have no grounds to bitch about other people. Seems to be a lot of women who want a fit guy but refuse to work their own lard asses out."
"I rotate my hips left and right really fast,  letting my penis slap against my thighs. It just really makes me laugh. "
"Yes, married men. Give me tips on how to best seduce your wives. "
Stop doing those things then. By doing them you are enabling her.
"And in my ass crack, and around my balls."
"It's a catch-22, really. Women are usually hesitant to give compliments like that because men *usually* (not always) latch onto that compliment and assume that the woman is interested, and continue to try and take the relationship further than the woman intended when she gave the compliment (sometimes going as far as stalking). But at the same time, men have that type of reaction because they're so used to radio silence that it feels nice to have someone compliment them."
"From what I've read (like that recent Harvard study), she is *much* more likely to jump ship when that happens.  "
"I love her but ""I'm going to do X today"" has a different meaning for us. It's not a big issue. We are just wired differently in that way. I make 3 plans with the goal to accomplish all 3. She makes 10 plans with the goal to accomplish 3. In the end, we get the same amount done. "
That she has gas like a trucker.
"OP if she started talking about ravioli formuoli then your girlfriend is probably a robot. 

**e:** in my nostalgic attempt to look up this scene I found this Wiz Khalifa and robot Krabs [mash up](https://youtu.be/3Q12xOukVAI) and have now reached nirvanioli. "
"If I find her unattractive, flattered and happy.

If I find her attractive, flattered, happy, and then suspicious because she may try to recruit me to an MLM or selling something."
I'll look down at my belly and promise to eat right starting that day to lose the fat. It's been a ten year ritual.
"I mean, if marriage is part of your long term plan, I get it.  You don't waste time with people you're incompatible with in the long term.  But I'd hope there'd be a discussion about your plans for the future and if and when marriage would be a thing, rather than an arbitrary deadline."
"I would absolutely be happy to do that with my wife. I don't really see it as taking care of though, because even though I'd go to work and being home money, she would be at home taking care of everything there. Home life would be easier on me, especially when kids come. so it's not really me taking care of her, it'd be us supporting each other in different areas of life.

No chance in hell she would ever be okay staying home all day though, she's lose her mind 😂"
Oh sweet boy.
"Actually she does owe you sex, as you owe her sex. This is a very important psychological need in the relationship. If either one of you is not putting forth their best effort to have sex then you have a big problem on your hands. 9/10 times it has nothing to do with the act itself, it could be work related stress, it could be you arent being the person who you were when she feel for you, it could be that another person is distracting her. Your job is to make sure you are furfilling her emotional needs first, without that you will never be able to really seduce her. When it comes down to the seducing thing if you are married there should have been plenty of times she has mentioned things you do that turn her on. It can range from sweating while working on something in the house, fixing or building things. It can be something as simple as putting on a belt or walking around in a wife beater. Gentlemen do your homework and always pay attention when a woman talks because when she stops talking It may be too late. "

"Well that deescalated slowly 

Sorry for your loss"
"I wish she told me she was moving in. She would stay over a couple times a week and never take her clothes back. Eventually she had more clothing at my place then her place so she said that she would just stay.  Then her dad moved away. 

That was 7 years ago and we just got married last May. "
We had one attractive girl in computer science out of over 120 students that year back in the day. Everybody hated me when she became my girlfriend after one semester. Am still with her.
"Lol word. This was actually about a different girl and I'm still kinda fucked up over the whole thing (she killed herself), but still embarrassing now that I look back on it. "

"&gt; that dumb fuck.

Best friend confirmed."
"Ugghh. When I used to stay round my ex's and she had an early shift. Instead of just getting ready and going to work leaving me in bed, she would set an alarm an hour earlier and wake up every ten minutes for an hour.

Ruined my sleep."
Or she could ask him out
"I've been there and done that. Never again.

I've always made a pretty good living. My ex-wife never made much money. When we had our daughter, it wouldn't have made sense for my (ex)wife to go back to work, as she wouldn't make enough money to even pay for child care. So she was a stay-at-home mom while I earned all the money to support the family.

Throughout our marriage that lasted just under ten years, I paid for everything. I paid the mortgage, I saved for our daughter's college, for retirement, etc. I paid my (ex)wife's student loans off before my own (which I'm still working on, 16 years out from law school). I paid for her to get braces, because the first time she had them as a teenager, she didn't wear her retainer enough and her teeth went crooked again. I paid for all our vacations, our cars, etc. All of it.

And despite all this, she had an affair. And wasn't even remotely interested in ending it. So we divorced, and in the current no-fault regime, she got half of our assets, PLUS alimony. That's right, folks, she cheated on me but I'm still stuck paying alimony to her. It's all based on a formula; there's no room for significant deviations and her bad behavior is completely ignored. (This is in addition to child support. I don't mind child support; it's my responsibility to support my child.)

So I don't know if I'm ever getting married again. But if I do, it's damn sure not going to be to someone who can't support herself financially. No. Not going to happen."
At least you don't have to hear about crossfit all of the time now.
"You have a good outlook on the subject, the hypocrisy of some is horrible. 

I used to be 115 lbs heavier than I am right now and I never for a second had animosity towards women who didn't find me attractive because of my weight. I never understood such a reaction. But I do find now that I'm fit, that being overweight is a total deal breaker for me. I've put in this much effort to change my life around, I feel that I've earned my way into the fit people dating pool. "
"Mine falls asleep on the couch every night and doesn't come to bed until about 5 am. I really thought we'd be sleeping in the same bed more.

"I always found this question so interesting because I am basically the same. I walk outside for 10 minutes I will see a few girls who I think are very attractive. It's like most of the girls I see are more or less attractive. I wonder if that is because you notice the attractive ones more and forget the rest or if you perceive the average as attractive. Most of the time when I notice them, it doesn't feel like they're average but really like ""wow, she's good looking"". That girl at the bus stop, the cashier at the local store, the neighbor's daughter, my teacher back in the day, they all look more than just decent."

"""Scarier""?  I'd say the existence of aliens,  The inexistence is more of an existential fear, but not a real threat.  Whereas life on other planets is a series of unknowns that could be potential threats.

"Except the study found that the number one indicator of whether a couple will divorce was whether the man was working full time. 

If a woman lost her job and it put stress on the family, it had no effect on the divorce rate. Only if the man wasn't working full time."
"Sounds like we'd be great friends.

It's not fair to anyone if I enter into a relationship with someone I'm not attracted to.

Eventually, one of three things would happen:

- She'd lose the weight, opening the way for a relationship.
- My attraction would grow to the point that I stopped caring as much about the weight.
- We'd move on."

"See also: ""as soon as you're in a relationship, the women come out of the woodwork"" phenomenon.

"Nevaeh is getting pretty popular among the pretentious professional helicopter mommy culture. ""Oh, it's Heaven spelled backwards!"" Well, backwards Heaven is gonna be in Hell if she has to spend 18 years under your obsessive surveillance. Then she'll go out to college so she can be independent for the first time and fuck a druggie called ""Reficul"" and get pregnant and name her kid ""Jaxper"" or ""Poutine"" or ""Gluteus"" and NOT VACCINATE HIM because ""My mother told me vaccines cause autism, and she was never wrong about anything. If I had surrendered my independence to her like she wanted, I wouldn't have a baby with polio and smallpox and fetal alcohol syndrome."" And Reficul ain't paying child support, because he rode his electric bicycle off a cliff in a drunken stupor and he's dead now.

Helicopter parents, man. Poor kids don't have a chance. I'm glad my mother wasn't always watching me. She didn't have to, I didn't have friends growing up."

"She cheated on me and lied to me multiple times about certain situations that would later turn out to have really happened.... I bought 5lbs of salt and wrote the words ""lying slut"" in the grass of her front yard. Within about 2 weeks the grass all died and he parents front yard had the words ""lying slut"" in it.... Looking back, I absolutely recognize that it was extremely immature but with her and that situation the lies ran too deep. Then again I looked like a psycho so that's no good. Idk. "

"Our nightly ritual is my wife rubs my back for a few minutes, then we spoon.  We tell each other 'I love you', and we fall asleep.  She's been doing this for nearly 20 years. I can't imagine not having this.  It's the best part of my day."
Done and done. 
"Real sex isn't optimized for an audience.  In real life, people can cum prematurely, or never at all, or quietly.  Bodies can make weird sounds.  And dudes don't generally pull out immediately before orgasm to shoot ropy jets of jism on their SO's lower back.  

Edit:  I feel like I should credit Henry Rollins for the turn of phrase ""ropy jets of jism.""  The sentiment remains the same. "

"Don't need to explain yourself. Just ask him out on a date.

I knew I wasn't the only one who did this. 
"Here's what I learned the hard way: Just because you're passionate about something when you graduate high school doesn't mean you're still going to be passionate about it 20 years later, or even 4 years later. Just because you're passionate about something doesn't mean you're talented at it. And even if you are talented at something, the job market for it might just flat out suck. I think it's better to find a job that has a good job market and that you kind of like. That said, I switched from graphic design to mechanical engineering."
"&gt;I just recently got some LED lights under my bed that make it look like a space ship which I am a fan of.

"I used to be much more shy and afraid to start conversations with girls than I am now but I always had a bigger fear of wondering ""what if I didn't talk to her?"" That drove me to giving it a shot and it usually turned out well. Sometimes didn't work out the best but rarely, if at all, ended horribly."
"How particular she is about cleaning- she has every step down to fine points and when its my turn to clean up she gets ticked

"No safe spaces here buddy, you either shitpost hard or you go home"
"The only times I've had an issue with going or staying flaccid it was directly related to stress about the situation. My partner had a bad reaction to it once. That gave me about a month of issues because of the anxiety that it might happen again. Fortunately I've found that immediate open communication with a partner regarding what's happening and why it's happening keeps that from happening anymore. 

I've also got an ace up my sleeve. I learned through experience that if I'm a little more selfless I can work through the ED and get a decent erection in the same session. The first time I worked through it I simply wanted to save face and at least make sure she got off after getting her all worked up. I matter of factly explained that these things sometimes happen and it's not her. She's fucking beautiful so clearly it's not her. I explained in detail how I wanted nothing more than to be with a woman as stunningly beautiful as she is. While explaining this I continued caressing her and kissing around her neck and eventually worked my way down until I was dining at the devil's cave. Once I got her off the first time the stress of the situation subsided and I was able to give her the grand tour of pound town. 
I highly recommend looking up the porn star tutorial on cunnilingus. It's a real game changer. "

"I use to smoke cigarettes and was standing outside a subway station puffing away one afternoon when this gorgeous woman walking down the street makes eye contact with me, more than a passing glance. 

There was a lot of foot traffic so she lost sight of me, but eventually makes her way through the crowd and finds me. By the time she reaches me I had fished through my pockets, found my pack, pulled out a cigarette and a lighter and had them held out to where she would eventually be standing. 

When she looks up and sees the cigarette I'm offering she's taken aback and asks ""how did you know?"" 

The answer of course was  ""well I certainly know you weren't walking up because you found me attractive"", but I just said nothing and enjoyed appearing suave for the moment. "

If you've been dating for a long time (like 5+ years), have extensively discussed marriage and kids, but he won't pull the trigger then women start to wonder why not.  Does he not love me enough?  When will he be ready?  Will he *ever* be ready?  I think that under certain circumstances, it's okay to break up because it appears that they are incompatible in this department."

You know how women complain about men sending them random dick pics and it's awkward because they're at work or whatever? This is the male version of that. If you don't want us to inject sex into your work day, don't inject the work day into our sex. "
"My girlfriend was diagnosed with a very aggressive form of leukemia at the beginning of this year. Had to watch her wither away in four short months.

"Anxiety has this funny way of making you perform even when you don't want to. I can't explain it but you're so nervous that you kind of say fuck it and start in. Unfortunately, this brings about a feeling of regret and guilt. You start thinking that people don't like you, they just like that other guy you pretend to be. Then you question why you act the way you do in social interaction; ""Why do I say these things?"" ,""Why do I feel the need to act this way around these people?"" It makes you feel like a phony and soon you start the downward spiral of self loathing. You become reclusive, only coming out during the night. You stop going out with friends because you couldn't bear another night of living in the lie. You stop grooming because you've stopped being social. You stop cleaning your living space because nobody comes over. You stop living your life because you're too afraid. "

I racked my brain to think of who it could belong to.

"For those wondering, this is a scale numbered zero to six (plus ""x"" as an extra value) that is meant to measure someone's sexual lifestyle. 

Zero is exclusively heterosexual and six is exclusively homosexual. The X is meant, essentially, for those who are wholly asexual.

The findings are/were *basically* that most people report that over their lifetime, they end up falling somewhere in the middle or nearer to the middle of the scale."
"Not bi (gay) but did date women in the past before I admitted to myself I was gay. 

It's a huge difference. 

For flirting with women, you have to do this whole song and dance and find the right way to ask her out, say the exact right things, be cautious with your jokes, and exude confidence the entire time despite being scared shitless that you'll fuck it up. You have to be careful to compliment without sounding creepy. 

For men you simply say something like ""Damn dude, you're handsome. Want to go for beers?"" 

Gay dating is far easier than straight dating. "

Porn is all about the visual and a lot gets sacrificed in order to provide this visual. Most people watch maybe 25% of a porn maximum and everyone has preferences. This is why couples in porn do about 3-5 different positions or acts so that people can just skip to their favorite. Of course it is also fake and they're chosen for their physical gifts, not their acting ability. This is why the moans are so awful and they just *get to the point* ASAP. If you've had real sex, main stream porn looks incredibly weird, like two people eating snow and pretending it's ice cream.

Real sex has pros and cons. Starting with the good stuff, there is a whole lot more love and affection going on. A whole lot of closeness in kissing and rubbing that doesn't translate well to camera. There are also fun silly moments, showing her a stupid face that she loves but pretends to hate, or dragging your combined bodies across the room so someone can check a text message. It is tender and loving. For the main *act* itself, if you've ever saw the movie [Zack and Miri Make a Porno](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1007028/?ref_=nv_sr_1) there is a scene where the two start to ""make love"" rather than have normal porn sex and it looks plain and unsexy. **This is because real sex is all about the feeling instead of porn being all about the visual.** Sticking with your favorite position feels amazing, doing a position that she loves the most is incredible when you watch how much pleasure you can give another human being that is in love with you. It doesn't translate well to the eye because your faces are too close that their two eyes start to look like a cyclops. While the naked body is beautiful, I think most people would agree that 90% or more of sex could still be enjoyed while blindfolded.

As for the bad stuff, no one in porn ever asks what the other person likes and there is no ""does this feel good?"" There's a bit of awkwardness in getting to learn the body of a new person. Sometimes people fart or someone's body makes a weird noise. Sometimes you try something new and she learns that having her hair pulled isn't as fun as she thought, or maybe you don't finish at the perfect moment and she tells you it's okay. Most real sex has some degree of flaw in it that the camera can't edit out. The condom doesn't always cooperate, people get sore after a while, and both partners don't often orgasm in perfect unison. You just kind of accept the bumps in the road because you want to make something great together. Sometimes love, sometimes just raw passion, but it is so much better when it's real."
"One thing that girls hear from guys is ""We want girls to initiate more."" Not that it's necessarily their fault, but many girls seem to confuse initiate with entice. They'll go to great lengths thinking that they're initiating, but are more than likely just being very enticing. This seems to be the biggest ""issue"" that affects interactions in dating and general courtship."
"Intimacy and (for those who have sex with their SO) romance are not portrayed very well in porn. You can get a great rush of feelings as a reaction when one or more of you says ""I love you"" or something else that is romantic, and when you are intimately cuddling and feeling the warmth of your partner's body. 

An exceptionally intimate experience is hearing your partner's heartbeat. "
That's undeniably bittersweet. How long were you married?
"I stayed home for a year while going to school. My husband supported me and paid all the bills while I cooked, cleaned, took care of pets,  appts etc and it drove me crazy after a few months. 

I actually became somewhat depressed because I didn't make my OWN money. Although I did get an allowance and had access to money....I grew up in a independent and hard working environment and I couldn't just ask for money. Too prideful. 

"
"I feel like women are really afraid of being rejected more than guys. If a girl isn't interested in a guy that approaches her, that's a Tuesday. It happens. But if a woman approaches a man and he's not interested... What's wrong with her? Why wouldn't he be interested? 

A commenter above mentioned that guys are in a desert, any water is appreciated. There's not a woman out there who wants to be the water that isn't worth drinking.  

Edit: Gold? Oh you guys, you make me feel like water worth drinking! "
"I approach a lot of women, so naturally I've been rejected a decent amount.

The key for me is, I know my value as a man and as a person is very high.  I have a lot of qualities that women value.

When I ask a girl out, I'm doing her a favor.  I'm offering her a good time that she otherwise wouldn't have.

So if the random girl at the grocery store, declines my offer to get coffee sometime, she's the one that's missing out.

She has to figure out, based on a 2 minute interaction if I'm the kind of guy she'd enjoy going out with.

I _already know_ that she would, but I don't blame her if she can't figure it out based on limited information.

I just smile and laugh about it, because they'll end up with some guy who isn't as good as I am.

----------

Disclaimer:  The above sounds pretty vain, and it is, but that mindset certainly kills any kind of negative feelings of rejection.

"Any time I pick someone out.  I'm attracted to non-white women exclusively, and me and all my friends are white.  So I'll give some conventionally attractive black woman the up-down.

I'm crap at mornings. Basically completely unfunctional. My SO normally makes me a cup of tea and brings it to bed for me and makes breakfast for both of us. However, I cook dinner for both of us every night and do all the washing up afterwards. My SO makes my mornings easier, I make their evenings easier. Not sure I would consider this ""enabling"" behaviour as the top comment has suggested.

"Unless you already have a knack for remembering stuff like this, keep a note on your phone to record important details as you learn them.

This girl gave the sloppiest head ever with enthusiasm only seen in porn. She then got on top and rode me like a pro and spit into my mouth. I was grossed out and turned on at the same time so I didn't know how to react. I thought it was amazing. No one has ever made me feel so ashamed of myself and horny at the same time. "

"Her dad is REALLY into trees.  The three of us went for lunch and he started talking to my girlfriend about this or that tree that he saw while hiking and sort of forgot that I was even there.

A few minutes in and he turns to me to ask where I'm from.  ""The Pacific Northwest.""  His eyes lit up and he went on a 10 minute speech about how wonderful the trees are from the Pacific Northwest and how he's always dreamed of going.  He listed off thousands of species and subspecies of trees and almost swooned when I showed him a few pictures of trees from around my home.

It was my ex wife. She started swinging and hitting me in the face. Grabbed my shirt and drug her nails all the way down my arm drawing a lot of blood. She hit me about 8 times before I decided to put a stop to it. I punched her right in the nose. After I immediately called the police. She was carted off to jail and I got off on self defense. I still have faint scars on my arm from her nails. It wasn't fun. Only time I have ever hit a woman. She fucking deserved it. 
"So, is it the case that she's attractive enough to sleep with but not attractive enough to have as arm candy?  If so, I'd say just suck it up and date her if you like her.  Maybe you'll get some shit from people.  Maybe they'll call you a chubby chaser.  But, you'll get over that, and your friends will get over that if she makes you happy.  Or if they don't, your friends leave something to be desired. 

I dated a pretty fat girl when I was in college.  Eventually I found that I just wasn't attracted to her, and that was a large part of breaking up.  But it was fun for a while.  Give it a shot.  "

"Dumped her after 5 years of dating. She was sure we were gonna get married and talked about it all the time/would drop hints about rings etc.

I knew doing so would be absolutely disastrous in the long run. She was a massive bitch 80% of the time and had absolutely no financial sense. Yes she was in med school so she'd eventually be making a lot of money. She'd also have $300,000 in debt. She never once ran the numbers on how long that would take to pay off *if she put her entire projected income towards her loans*. The answer was 8 years. She ""didn't believe me"". The depths of her financial retardation were deeper than the Mariana Trench.

Only reason we lasted so long is my opinion of myself was so low that I'm the only person who could take her bitchiness. I'd kill myself if I had to come home to her every day for the rest of my life. 

So yeah. She thought we were gonna marry, I said no, we are done. She threatened to kill me and then threatened to kill herself. Her mom and dad sent me nasty emails and voice mails. Her friends harassed me on FB.

"I simply don't find overweight people attractive. It doesn't mean I don't think they're awesome people but I just really don't like fat, and people who are fat will be at great odds with the healthy lifestyle that I lead. Most fat girls I see would be absolutely stunning if they were a healthy weight. Simply put, I don't see why I should be romantically involved with you if you won't take the time to take care of yourself properly. You're not a bad person, you've still got huge amounts of worth, but my monkey brain doesn't find excessive fat attractive because it's unhealthy. "

Either case, it's a loss for the one who doesn't want to take a break.He dumped you. Get this into your head. Your only possible answer is an ""Ok"".

"*Everything* about our culture overestimates the amount of sex that *everybody* is having. Sexual health statistics say that the most common number of partners over lifetime is between 2 and 3, and a person having 0 or 1 partner over their whole life is not uncommon. It's actually more common then the whole alternate sexualities group put together.

As for myself, sex is a highly emotional act, and a moment of extreme weakness. I need several months of getting to know a person before I'm comfortable enough for the clothes to come off. So if I like the person and I like the sex, I don't see myself ever wanting more then one partner."

"I hear sleeping in your own bed when married might actually be good for you as you get a better quality of sleep over a longer period of time, meaning you won't get cranky anymore whenever your SO accidentally wakes you up at night.

I had a feeling somebody would call me out on that. I understand that mid 20s isn't old but it was my understanding that the people who know what they want to do in life already know it by this point if that makes any sense.
Uh...Thanks for sharing that...I guess
Exactly.  People are dancing around the issue but women care a lot about the social status of their husband and giving support in hard times tends to be something men are better at.

"That isn't necessarily true. My mom changed career tracks in her mid 30's. As someone who is now in her mid 30's and doesn't like what I do, I'm also interested in hearing the perspective of people my age and older. Changing careers at your age is 1000x easier than doing it at mine, or even more so when you reach your 40's, because of prejudicial attitudes about age in the job market. My parents got divorced in their 40's and my dad had such a hard time getting a job after he moved, even with a great resume, that he had to start his own business to earn income. So experiences will be wildly different based on age."

"To a certain extent. I was never naive enough to believe that men didn't have insecurities or that they didn't face pressures in society. Reading /r/AskMen has shown me that being expected to be the aggressor in the dating game can really wear on one's ego after a while. 

So how do I feel about men having insecurities? We all have them! But insecurities are different than bitterness. And I read a lot of bitterness on this sub too. Some of the posters here have really improved my view of men, largely the regulars. A lot of the posters here have really harmed my view of men, and it honestly gets so tiring after a while. I suspect male posters would feel similarly exhausted from reading askwomen threads all about how much men suck, how men just want to trap you on marriage, how men have it sooooo hard, how men don't understand women, etc. I stopped posting to askwomen long ago in part due to that. I really love this sub sometimes, but other times it makes *me* feel like shit."
"I once got a text from a ""girl"" who got the ""wrong number "" and then proceeded to ask me where was good in town and asked if I could show her round. After a little amateur detective work it turned out it was one of my girlfriend's college mates. 

Now I don't think he could've got my number any other way than from my gf and she was very defensive of him when I called her out on it and threatened him. So I'm pretty sure she was behind it. 

I thought nothing more of it cause I was in love with her.

"For those struggling with this -- it doesn't have to be 100% one or the other.

We are light sleepers with insomnia issues and different schedules. Our solution is that we sleep together on the weekends only.

We both get to prioritize sleep during the work week, which is when it matters the most because we have to get up early.

On weekends we wake each other up sometimes, but it's less important because we can sleep in. And I don't mind being a little tired on a Sunday.

When we sleep together, we have the understanding that if one of us is having trouble sleeping they can peace out to the guest room any time. 9 times out of 10 just knowing I have the option relaxes me enough that I can fall back to sleep when she accidentally wakes me up."
"I'm not a very good family member, or person within the family because I don't feel a real connection with my family.

It feels like I'm an acquaintance in my family rather than a family member.

As a result, I don't feel much of anything for my family. So, if/when an immediate or extended family member is sick or has something to celebrate, it feels like I'm hearing/reading a piece of news rather than something to feel. 

I end up saying ""that sucks"" or ""cool"" most of the time because of the lack of feeling.

I'm afraid that this carries over into my relationships, too, because I'm not sure what to do as far as making a good relationship, since I've never really had a basic one.

So, I feel bad for not caring, but it's also because I don't know what to do."

I've found she reacts best when I jokingly make fun of her over little things with an assertive tone to my voice, hug and kiss her and if she acts like she doesn't want anymore, but is smiling in a certain way that says she's not, I'll often pick her up and push her up against a wall or something and get more aggressive. If she reacts positively then I know it's game on, tell her to get in the bedroom, follow her in and she's good to go. Worked for the two of us for 14 years now. "

"Let me tell you about my worst one since it happened about 2 weeks ago.

Met a girl on OKC, talk for a few days and decide to hang out that weekend.  I get her address and head out that way thinking we'll stop and have some food then go back to my place and watch a movie.  I get to her house and she lugging a kid and a car seat towards my car.

I ask her wtf and she tells me she lost her sitter so she has to bring her 9 month old over...right behind her are her 2 very very polish family members.  I try and greet them nicely and they immediatly tell me they know a lot of cops in the area and if anything so much as happens to her, they'll come after me.  I just kind of laugh, give them my info (phone/address) and we head out.

I already was kind of annoyed by the situation.  Babysitting a 9 month old on a first date is probably the worst idea possible and then on top of that, all the pics this girl had given me were clearly before the baby and she was MUCH larger now.  But I felt obligated.  She ask to skip dinner and just go over to my place.

We get there and the baby is just screaming.  Hours and hours of screaming.  The entire time the girls mother is blowing up her phone asking if she's alright.  I think she could tell I was pretty annoyed.  Then she ask to spend the night because her mom is pissing her off.  So I reluctantly say ok but ask her to let her parents know so shit doesnt hit the fan later.

Welp, she doesn't.  The baby screams the entire night and she ignores some 30 messages from her parents.  About 3 am I get a knock on my door.  2 cops doing a welfare check.  Her mother called them because she was worried.  We're able to explain the situation and cops leave 5 minutes later but she can tell I am beyond annoyed.  The next morning, I wake up to 10 messages from her mother asking me why I'm not responding...

Finally get the girl and her baby in my car and head out to her house, hoping to drop her and never contact her again.  Unfortunately, her mom is waiting outside and gives me an earful about keeping her 27 year old daughter out all night.  I ended up sitting there for 3 hours while they try and ask me every detail of my life.  When I leave, the girl tells me she wants to see me again.  I smile and tell her I'll text her.

The next day I'm up at work and her mother sends me a text.  ""Since you want to date my daughter, I am going to ask you some questions that I hope you can answer.""  I reply back that I'm at work but would be more than happy to answer her questions in person as I think it's inappropriate to do this while I'm working.

She keeps asking anyways.  I text her daughter and ask her why her mother is harassing me.

""I dunno, it's so embarrassing.  She's about to text you again.""

I block them both.  They start calling me from unlisted numbers across the US.  Leaving threatening voice mails and shit.

The final one I got I was super pissed and exploded on them.  ""You think after 1 date I have any goddamn obligation to talk to you or your daughter?  There are so many goddamn red flags right now.  9 month old kid being brought on our first date, parents harassing me, falsified pictures and all she can talk about the entire time is baby daddy.  Lose my goddamn number and don't ever contact me again.

I'm 30 and I don't have time for that shit.

People will cite ""pre selection"" as the reason women are attracted to men in relationships and come out of the woodwork for them, but honestly it's mostly that straight men who are already taken are more relaxed and confident, and can just have regular friendships with women without us worrying about them trying to sleep with us.

So I guess if you want to get laid, treat women like people and don't make your motivation for talking to us be ""getting laid""."
"The wife being jobless isn't as big a deal. They can always default to being a housewife which may or may not be ideal for the couple, but from societies expectations is fine so it wouldn't cause as much tensions and the guy really can't get on her too much for that.

A guy loosing his job wouldn't want to just stay at home for the stigma of being a deadbeat. He would get more stressed/self conscious and the girl would be less accepting of it since its kind of drilled into every married couple that the hubby will take care of the financial burdens. Heck her friends/others may tell her she ""deserves better"" or whatnot. She would constantly get on him for not getting a job and thats where the marriage will eventually fall apart."

"I'm in the US, mid-40s and Catholic light(meaning I'm a fairly liberal Catholic).  I think the way the question is worded makes it hard to say ""Yes.""  

My wife didn't work or worked part time for several years when the kids were little, and that didn't seem like ""taking care of my wife"" so much as ""taking care of the family"" where we both had jobs to do.  I think a lot of people would answer yes if the question was ""if you can make ends meet, would you be willing to be the sole breadwinner while your wife stays home with the kids.""   The reality is that not many people have the financial flexibility to make that happen.

But the question of just taking care of your wife while she stays home with no kids?  That feels a bit too one-sided an arrangement.  "

"Also bi, and I agree. Women have more room to work with regarding makeup, and we all know we look like shit for the most part when we wake up anyways (or at least, we think we do). I think that alone makes us a bit more forgiving towards a girl if she isn't wearing any at all. Guys, on the other hand, are just stuck with what they've got... although on that note, more women seem to know how to groom themselves well in general, while ""style"" seems to be a giant mystery to a lot more men, ratio-wise.

My bf is a good example: he's an attractive guy, but has zero idea how to do his hair. He doesn't even know what haircut to get, let alone how to apply gel or even comb it. Hasn't played with different cuts so he keeps it pretty short and simple. He doesn't invest a lot of time in his clothing style, either, so that's underdeveloped. Is it detrimental to his attractiveness to me? No, clearly not - I'm just going to tear his clothes off anyways. BUT, I tell him all the time that if he came up to me wearing a snazzy suit and vest with smart shoes, I'd melt. Fashion goes a long way."
"Well, I'm a decent looking guy, I was making a lot of money at the time and (humblebrag) I'm a really good fucking boyfriend.

They all were interested in me during the 3 years we were dating and I guess they were waiting to pounce.

I did it all within the same month, went out with one or two a week and we all hooked up on the first date. (they knew me for years).

I guess they didn't communicate with each other about it because they didn't want my ex finding out. "

"The new 'Yay! women' chant is that women are now the main breadwinner in 1/3 of households, but 2/3ds of that are single moms. Do some research online or basic math and you see that only 8-11% of married households have women as the main breadwinner.  And the new stat making its way around is that a marriage is 3x as likely to end in divorce when the woman earns more than the man"
"&gt;it drove me crazy after a few months.

I'm a ""house husband"" and feel the exact opposite.  I was absolutely miserable working but now I am perfectly happy dealing with the household.

I'm very introverted though and I'm sure that has a lot to do with it.  I'm completely fine if I talk to no one but my wife for months at a time."
This one instantly makes me imagine an obese woman.

On the other hand no one said the woman has to keep the baby. 
"It's always been weird for me because I'm black so some guys have literally said, ""Hi sweet chocolate mocha,"" or my favorite, ""Have you ever tried the other side?""

"Your emotions will probably catch you by surprise. Therefore, it is important to learn how to become self-aware of your emotions and why you are feeling that way, before you attempt anything rash.


   To clarify, when I got into my first relationship I considered myself to be a very logical person. I knew that I thought things through, I had a very high tolerance, I didn't have knee-jerk emotional reactions to things. Basically, I figured that I was well-prepared because I considered myself a rational person, and I had read up on a lot of relationship and dating advice so I knew not to be jealous, or manipulative etc etc. 

 
   BUT! It didn't matter that I thought I was a rational person, or that I thought I had a high tolerance, it didn't matter that I knew jealousy was bad, communication was good, and that I should do this, and not do that. The fact and reality of the situation was that this was my first relationship. As such, I was subject to stimuli and emotions that I had never before experienced in my life.


   I found myself getting jealous, despite reading about how jealousy was not healthy. And because I figured I couldn't get jealous I didn't know how to begin solving my issue and instead concluded that it must be an issue with the relationship, thus lumping my gf into my own problems. 


I found myself getting clingy and overbearing at times, despite being certain that I wasn't going to be clingy or overbearing, because I learned from friends and read on internet forums that those things were bad. 


Basically what I'm saying is you could read an entire book worth of relationship advice, but the most important advice I can give to someone in a relationship for their first time, experiencing a wave of new emotions and situations, would be to learn how to understand what you are feeling and why you are feeling that way. 


You're probably going to be jealous at some point, most likely points, during your relationship. Instead of immediately reacting on the emotion, instead of trying to suppress or ignore the emotion, you should just try to understand it. It's perfectly okay to get jealous at times, same with other emotions. What's not okay is reacting impulsively or irrationally on your emotions, especially when you end up dragging your SO in with you."
"Very meaningful. I don't hear it often at all.

"I believe that looks wise, the potential to be is there but I think I'm too awkward and my mental health problems are a little too deep to be attractive *right now*"
"Earlier this year, I had a day of hell.

It was a Friday, and we had this huge deadline at work. After staying overtime for 3 hour the day before, I then get shouted at by my manager for a minor task. In fairness, she was also being overworked and needed to vent. While she apologised later in private, she had shouted at me in front of a new hire. I lost respect for her, and never truly got it back.

So, I was overworked, underappreciated, and just wanted out. I was meeting the girl I had been seeing at the time that night. After giving her the footnotes version of the week, she decides that now is the best time to tell me she's got mixed feelings about going forward. So I ask her:

""So...are you saying you don't want to see me again?""

Without missing a beat, she replies:

""Yeah...well, I mean-""

I didn't let her finish. I had already felt unappreciated and unrecognized that day; now I felt unwanted, which was far worse.

Still, if I learned anything from that day, it's that I can handle myself when shit hits the fan, both professionally and personally. I will undoubtedly have worse days in my life, and now, I can be able to master them."
Every time I see my therapist it's the first thing he asks me.

"I used to believe that. The theory I'm believing now is that he never really wanted this job, nor did he expect to get this far. His ego is too big to just step down and admit that he never really wanted this thing, so he's trying to do everything in his power to blow the election."
"This girl asked me out. I was gonna go meet her at her place (a sublet in a house-residential neighborhood). Her directions were vague, but I had an address.

I get to the street and drive up and down it looking for this place. Eventually, I see this couple walking along and ask ""excuse me, can you tell me where (address) is?"" 

And they respond ""You must be looking for (Girl'sname!)"". 

And I'm thinking *how many people come looking for her, exactly?*

They were her parents, obviously, but it took a sec to sort that out. ;) "
"Small enough that they don't sag and look kinda perky ([NSFW1](http://i.imgur.com/yySENYI.jpg), [NSFW2](https://i.imgur.com/kdqiIol.jpg)) but large enough that they look big with a push-up ([3](https://i.imgur.com/SxxqCrv.jpg), [4](http://i.imgur.com/GMdyV4gl.jpg))

Hers are fake, but I know people with similar ones that are real. Personally I'd take smaller and perkier over larger and saggier ones."
"Take honest stock of what you actually have to offer.  If it's good, then keep going.  If not, work on improving yourself.

And understand that dating isn't a war zone.  It's an audition.  Just because you're not right for the part doesn't mean you're bad.  Edward Norton is a hell of an actor, but you wouldn't cast him as the lead in a Martin Luther King Jr. biopic.  "

"The spectrum of rejection is very wide when it comes from females. Males are going to figure that you could say no a million different ways, and it means NO!!!!!!!!!

So.. you have to speak very clearly. That means literally. Tell him that you do like him, and you welcome him to try again but not on stage in front of all your coworkers."

"You know there are more people at college than those in computer science, right?"
"My Dad worked in real estate for 30+ years and recently quit to become a substance abuse counselor. Totally different field, but he went through all the training and got certified and is now working a job he loves at a major hospital. Oh, and he'll be 70 in April. It's really never too late. Reminds me of that quote that's always on Reddit:

""The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is right now"". "
So let her clean everytime then and you take over a different responsibility everytime

"Dinner at my house. It allows me to show off my cooking skills, it makes me feel in control of the situation which helps with any possible awkwardness, there is no one bothering us with loud music and it's easier to translate to the bed room."
"This is based totally on anecdotal evidence, but isn't it that when the man loses his job and is unable to find a job, he also still refuses to take on ""house husband"" kind of jobs? For instance, cooking, cleaning, child care? Most instances I see is that when a man loses his job, the wife becomes breadwinner, chef, maid, nanny all at the same time, while the man just sulks about his lost job. Which leads to divorce because no one wants to have to deal with that. 

Of course, totally anecdotal. But I do see this being a reason why when a man loses his job, the wife divorces him because she doesn't want to be the only adult in the relationship. "
"Most girls I know have plenty of people they talk to frequently, that they hang out with, go out with, etc. but I wouldn't call them friends. Their relationships are really superficial. 

One of my friends went through severe depression, the kind where she was placed on suicide watch, and plenty of the people whom she thought would be there to talk to her and to help her through things weren't. 

One time she called up a guy she knew, crying, asking to talk, and he told her to call back in an hour because he was watching The Walking Dead. Another guy friend straight up told her that he couldn't deal with her shit anymore. Some of her roommates moved out because they couldn't handle it either. 

Then there are the guy friends she thought she had who stopped talking to her once they started seeing someone. 

They're friendly but not really friends, y'know?"

"Depends on how overweight. And extra 10, even 20 can be totally fine (it's highly dependent on height) but at a certain point there's a very sharp dropoff. I've seen attractive obese women, but these are women who are pretty much flawless otherwise, great hair, skin, fashionable, good with makeup, they lucked out on genetics and carry the weight in favorable ways, such as her face doesn't look bloated, the fat accumulate on hips and ass more than stomach, etc."

100% agree with this. Also important to add that you allow your relationship to grow organically. Listen to her and also to yourself. Communicate effectively as your learn each other's strengths and weaknesses
