"Tell her the puppy is extremely honored.

Edit: feeling honored myself; tyks!"
He's going to eat meat anyway. All you get to choose is whether you make him hate you or not
Unplug your router / modem. Can't get a IP address if its not on the internet... See what he says. 
"Both.

When a man blatantly tells you he feels he owns your body and warns you not to devalue his property or else, pay attention."
I wouldn't even compromise with it as a middle name. That is really weird and embarrassing. There are literally countless name choices. Make him choose something else.
"She's in love with you and you're in love with her, whether you know it or not. Don't let these feelings destroy the love you two have for each other. You say being intimate with her felt right, trust your instincts and let her trust hers.

She trusts you. Her family trust you. It's not because you're her only friend, it's because you're a great friend and a trustworthy person. You deserve her. Don't overthink it."
She definitely owes both you and your sister apologies. She assumed the worst of you immediately and she attacked your sister. There's no excuse for that. If she's unwilling to apologize you are 100% justified to cut her off. 
"You gave him one pass. *One*. You said ""you do *anything* like this again, and I am out the door"". Follow through.

You are super-turbo against cheating, correct? He has cheated on you. Respect yourself enough to recognize *he* doesn't respect you."
"Just one input: The reason why your sis would not feel safe at home anymore even after the creep was gone, was because your mother is unsafe for her.

I think you did the best that was in your power - I am really glad you two got to a place where you can maintain a greater distance to your mother and therefore feel more safe"
"Someday you are going to tell this story at parties and have a hearty laugh about this, because pretty much walking in on your boyfriend cheating and having him cook up that excuse is a hilarious story. 

But the follow up question is always going to be ""so did you dump him??"" and right now you get to decide whether the answer to that question is ""hell yeah, dumped that fool"" or ""no, I believed him and hung on for three more months until I caught him again"""
"""Boyfriend, stop making my traumatic experience all about you.""

And stop soothing his ego when he brings it up. Just say that one line. "
"That's a nice, solid apology."
"Cancel the wedding. It's cheaper than getting a divorce.

Also, do NOT have children with her. Children are a fuckton of work, and if she can't keep the house clean as an unemployed person with no children, you'll be living in a hellhole when there are children. 

I believe strongly that chores should be split and that no one should do all the housework, but if one person is working long hours and the other one is unemployed, the unemployed one should be doing just about everything. "
"&gt;I’m not sure what to do now.

What you should do now is nothing. "
"Yeah this is the way to go. Next time he is out unplug the router. I'd bet money he phones immediately. Use that time to search. I'd search first for a camera. That's the most likely thing he's using. Plan out your searching. Think about places one could have been hidden. Objects that could hold one. Make a plan ahead of time and then when the opportunity strikes, go at it. 

If it were me I'd wait until his next out of town trip to unplug the router. That way you have all the time in the world to search"
"Next time he goes away, unplug the cable modem.

If he is monitoring you, he won't be able to without the internet going into the house.  Power off your cell phone and any other tablet during this time as well...in case he is using those as a microphone.

Take that time to really carefully go through the house.  Wherever you were looking when you got busted the first time is where I would start.  Pay attention to anything that has been moved.  Look at the air vents, returns, and smoke detectors.  These usually have a layer of dust on them.  If the dust has been disturbed, odds are, someone disturbed them.  Look for scuffs on the floor or indentations in the carpet as if a chair or piece of furniture had been recently moved.

If there is a camera or a microphone, odds are he is going to have one in the bedroom, so start there.  The living room is the next logical option.

**most importantly, take pictures in every room.**  When he gets back in town, he is going to want to know what happened with his listening devices.  He'll check the internet and the actual devices to make sure that A) they are working and B) they are still there.  Maybe  place the modem at a certain angle or facing a certain direction.  If for some reason the first thing he does is check the modem when he gets home...you'll know you are barking up the right tree.

You can then wait until he is out of the house again and go room to room seeing if anything is out of place...comparing things to the pics you took while the internet was off.  

If you can't find anything, option B would be to set a honey trap.  So randomly, from time to time, play with your phone ringtones to make your phone ring...and then fake pick up and say ""hold on for a second"" then turn up the tv really loudly.  Leave it on for a while and see if he calls.  When he calls, mute the tv or the radio and pick it up.  If he asks you what you were doing, just say taking a nap or something.  If he asks about the tv or the radio, say no...you've just been napping.

You might catch him in a lie that way..





  "
"&gt;  the facts that I'm the biological parent and she smokes weed every single day will both work in my favor.


Game, set, and match.

Best of luck!"
"OP's parents admitted they made mistakes, made true amends and nobody needed a restraining order?

This isn't the /r/relationships I'm used to."
Ignoring her disability for a moment. What are your feelings then? Are you dismissing this potential relationship because she's disabled?
"&gt; Fuck her. Who the fuck is she to say that to me?

&gt; He was cheating on me.

Put them BOTH on blast. Cheating asshole announced his Facebook relationship before actually breaking up with GF of six years.

Tag them with a link to this post so all their mutual friends and your shared network can know how vile they are."
"Your sister should report the assault to the cops, she was assaulted which should not go unpunished.  I would also stay away from any family gathering until she profusely apologises to your sister.  

She sounds a little unhinged, and your boyfriend should be completely siding with you on this matter, he should have no issue to you blanking his mother until she becomes an adult and fixes the problem she caused."
"The way you tell it, your wife is taking the lead on everything with your family.

What have *you* been saying to them? Are you saying, ""Well, [Wife] doesn't want you to spank daughter."" Or are you saying, ""*We* do not spank our daughter and you will not either.""

It's a big difference. One is implicating your wife as the sole reason for this parenting decision, the other is implying that both of you - *together* - have made this parenting decision."
"&gt;I asked what she meant and she told me that she'd told her co-workers about my ""behavior"" and they told her I was crazy.

I wonder what sort of messed up version of the truth she told them!"
"I fully understand her assumption (who thinks 'maybe she has a twin sister?'), but the slapping was completely out of order, and her refusal to apologise shows a really petty, immature streak in her. 

If I lost it and attacked someone, and then I learned it was the wrong person, I would be apologising before they'd even finished saying 'it was my twin'. I'd feel *appalled* at myself. The fact that she's refusing to says a lot.

I would say OP, that your boyfriend needs to have strong words with her, and if she still refuses to apologise then you cut off contact."
"Well, everyone involved *is* Canadian. "
"So I'm obviously not your bf, but as someone who would like to think they are a good tolerant, understanding, person I admit that mentally disabled people make me uncomfortable as fuck. No idea how to react around them, and I just have a strong desire to be anywhere else. It sounds awful, I'm not exactly proud of it, but that is my reaction. Closest analogy I can think of for people who don't feel this way is when a weird homeless guy wants money and you just swirve around them and don't look. Obviously different reasons, but same response. My guess is he is something similar but doesn't want to upset you by saying he is uncomfortable and is attempting to avoid the situation altogther."
Just reading your first paragraph makes it pretty clear you don't want this relationship and aren't invested in it. Divorce her so you can both move on.
Why did you accept a lap dance if you knew your partner wasn't OK with that?
"Jesus christ I feel awful for your wife

You need to choose.  Your wife or your parents.

I bet your supervisor said something to *her* supervisor after your first meeting and got schooled and harshly. 
"They wouldn't do it if they didn't want to. They obviously love you and want the best for you. The best thing you can do is not waste this opportunity and show them that you appreciate their efforts. Delaying kids and visits at 25 is not a big deal. You're more important. 



"
"I agree that your Grampa is an bit of an asshole.  But your family members will probably come around and start kissing your ass once they realize that you'll hold the purse strings.  (And then you'll wish they weren't talking to you again.)

Here's the thing... You worked for this.  Your family members knew Grampa as well as you.  They all wanted the quick buck more than to work hard, learn, and earn a piece of the business.  That's not your fault.

As for the inheritance, my bet is that the bulk of Grampa's wealth is in his business.  The best way for him to ensure that the business he built continues to flourish is to leave it all to one person.  Certainly, if he left everyone in the family a percentage, there would be squabbles, and many family members would want to sell it to make a quick buck.  And if he leaves you the business, leaving you his cash makes sense to help with cash flow issues.

As for telling everyone about his will, now, it is kinda a dick move.  But it gives family members, who might have been planning their retirement around an inheritance, the time to figure out how to take care of themselves.  Also, it could help forestall future efforts to contest his will.  Grampa is certainly of sound mind, right now, and he's been very public about his wishes.  It would be difficult for a family member to argue otherwise.

With regards to yours and your Grampa's different opinions about your family, your opinion is based on your relationship with them.  Your Grandfather's is based on his.  My bet is that at least some family members have gotten, or asked for, financial support of some kind from Grampa, in the past.  He wants to see his family members be self-sufficient and to earn their livings.  And some of them may have expected to live better off his money, in the past.  And that is *precisely* the same reason family members are all being assholes to you now.  Because they're pissed that they aren't getting Grampa's money.  I can guarantee that more than one of your family members have behaved the same way about money to your Grampa, in the past.

My advice:  Ignore anyone who is being rude now.  Don't count on this inheritance.  If/when Grampa does die, and you do inherit, consider giving none of the money to anyone... Or at least none of it to anyone being rude to you now.  Also, tell your Grampa how you're being treated and beg him to live forever."
"&gt;(Plot twist: it turns out I don't have any problem with Alex kissing guys if it's me he's kissing.)

Funniest self-realization on this sub *EVER*!"
"When getting to know my SO's mentally disabled brother it was much more stressful having lots of people around. I felt like my interaction was being judged by everyone around me who was already experienced in interacting with him. You're already 'on' when you're around an SO's family, so adding this additional 'test' is stressful as fuck. Think of things you've had to try for the first time that you had no idea how to do &amp; you were very nervous bout.  Now imagine a bunch of people sitting around watching you try to figure it out as you go. People who have been doing it for years. People who will judge your character based on how well you can figure this out.

Can you set up a hang out with just the 3 of you? Seriously don't even have your parents there. Maybe you guys could go visit him at his facility for an hour or 2 or he comes to visit you. Just the 3 of you could do an activity that you know Christian enjoys. For me it was comforting to watch my SO interacting with her bro &amp; just see the back &amp; forth. It made it much easier for me to try. I think you're underestimating how difficult it can be for someone that's never had the experience."

"Girls Scout mom here...this happens all the time.  You need to push on your local organization hard.  They should have a policy or you can start mentioning that you are thinking about calling the press.  This usually can make the TV news.  Usually what to do is to call the police and report it as embezzlement.  If your co leader isn't poor..they can get away with it if they pay it back ASAP.  

However...even if the ""leader"" can't pay it back the kids in the troop are screwed.  There is no national policy on this very, very common issue except for that the Girl Scouts don't help out financially.  This is why it is a HUGE issue.  Those little kids got their work invalidated and THEIR money stolen.  Public outrage after a TV story will usually get them some donations in order to have something of a troop."
"Next time she does it look her in the eye and say ""well when I'm dead I won't make that mistake again"" then go for a high five"
"You can say no to them. In fact, you MUST say no to them for the sake of your own child. Continuing to expose him to this verbal abuse would be absolutely terrible, and while I understand that your parents are basically in denial, they are going to have to accept reality at some point."

Your daughter will have great memories of you prioritizing your parents feelings over her. 
"&gt; They were DEVASTATED when they learned that we wouldn’t be moving home when we got pregnant; my mom called me sobbing every day for months and my dad sent me a lot of strongly-worded emails about how I was letting my wife “break up the family”.

Your parents are disgusting manipulative. If I were you, I'd be glad to be far away them; they don't own you and shouldn't expect to control you like this.

You need to put your foot down with them and insist they stop blaming your wife for your decisions. You made the choice to move before you got married, right? You have mutually decided not to spank your daughter. Take responsibility for the choices you've made and stop hiding behind your wife. I think you should cancel the visit and go low contact until they can respect both you and your wife. "
"I grew up with mostly boys (I'm a girl) and I have fallen asleep in the same bed with my male cousins and brothers. No one ever freaked out. Then I have this aunt that wouldn't let her daughter come swimming at my house when they were visiting because boys would be there....her cousins. My aunt thought it was inappropriate for her male relatives to see her in a bathing suit. 

Some folks are just like that. If you guys don't feel weird and inappropriate about it and there isn't anything inappropriate going on, then I think it's fine. "

Your vacation sounds like something that Jason Segel would play the lead actor in.
"Me too. To tell the truth, I was extremely hurt by that. I had an issue with our relationship and I brought it to an anonymous forum where I tried to present a balanced view of the issues. She turned to people we both know in real life and painted a picture of me that was clearly distorted. I don't know why it's come to that but it really hurt my heart."
"I don't think this is about a clock at all. 


First of all, look at how he responds to a reasonable request by you (it's doesn't matter *what* the request is, IMO): 


&gt;He will stop doing it for a little while, and then he will just do it again.


That's not great. There's an action that's causing you fairly significant irritation, and he doesn't care enough about that to stop doing it. 


Now look at how he reacts when you enforce a *completely reasonable* boundary:


&gt;He got very angry and stormed out of bed saying how rude I was and all this nonsense.


That's even more not great. He's punishing you because he wants to be able to continue to do something that bothers you. 


Now look at how he reacts when you offer a compromise:


&gt; I will buy him a clock. Easy, right? I tell him ""Look, I am going to buy a clock to put next to your bed"" and he freaks out.


That's... the most not great.


So what we have here is someone who doesn't care about your comfort, who doesn't care about your boundaries, and isn't interested in compromising with you.


If this is how he acts over a *clock*, how is he going to handle any greater conflict or issues in a relationship?


I don't see this as dumping him over a clock. I see this as dumping him over pretty serious issues about his ability to respond to and resolve conflict. "
You need to have a serious come-to-Jesus chat with Sarah about her completely irresponsible enabling of her mother. Do the two of you want kids in the future? You won't be able to afford them so long as Sarah is supporting her mother this way. 
"Something similar happened to me and my twin, except she was in a different country on vacation when she ran into my (now) ex boyfriends mom. His mom was shocked and upset at first, but she didn't HIT my sister! That's just straight up crazy and unnecessary, If she had done that I would have cut her out of my life. If I was you I would really consider having someone in my life who's first thought is to resort to violence against you when they perceive you to be doing something wrong, and also someone who can't apologize when they are clearly in the wrong. It's nuts that she expects an apology, if I was your sister I'd be pressing charges JUST because she has the nerve to expect an apology after slapping me. 

I don't think you should just let this go- it just reinforces that her behavior has no consequences, which I suspect is what usually happens if her first thought was to slap your sister, then expect an apology. "
"&gt;She dislikes him for legitimate reasons. He has dis-respected her in the past multiple times.

Should this guy have really been your best man in the first place?"
You could fake a phone call where you say that you've lost your job or that you're pregnant or something else dramatic that will generate a response.  But I worry about you provoking too strong of a response.  Normal men don't secretly watch their wives from work trips.
You should take his key away and tell him he isn't welcome there. Why should he be? Literally her parents died and he's finding ways to intentionally hurt her after the fact.
"I think you have a right to be upset. If it were a day hiking trip that would be one thing. But he's choosing to spend time with another woman, alone, sleeping under the stars, while she's in the middle of a rocky marriage. During your birthday. This is a recipe for disaster. For me, it would be a deal breaker. Having friends of the opposite sex is one thing. Going on solitary overnight, borderline romantic trips with that friend? Alone? Uh uh. No way. "
"* Grandparents have taken a initiative that could make them never see their grandkid again, just because it could save his life.

* Parents have taken a decision that could make him die, because they don't want to use their brain.

Question is, who do you want to reward, or punish, for their choices ?

Your sister and her husband are being egoistic and dangerous, they'll deserve the truth when they'll care about their kid's health."

The wanting-marriage thing you'll have to decide for yourself. See how it goes before you make to much judgement. He's just getting out of a marriage. He may want nothing to do with it for a while. 

And on that note, I wouldn't make judgements based on his divorce. Lots of people get divorced for lots of reasons. And if he's getting divorced I really wouldn't consider it cheating for him to be starting to keep his options open. Emotionally he's made the choice to start leaving that relationship. Do be aware of rebound. 

But, if he's now getting divorced, was he married when he was window-flirtingish? Just things to keep in mind. It's not really damning imo, just another element to be aware of. 

I'm glad you guys met and it seems to have gone well :)"
"I talked to him and he said that ""I know the name will be affiliated with her and that's okay, I used to have feelings for her, but now she is just a friend I respect and it is like you naming the child after a close friend"".

When my son was around the same age he started going to Christian youth groups with his friends. Everyone expected me to flip when I found out because of my opinions on religion. I didn't.  I just told him he's old enough to figure this out for himself.

Your son is old enough to start figuring it out for himself.

"She fucked up. It's common sense not to wear a white/cream dress to someone else's wedding. She doesn't get a pass because she's ""young and quirky."" The bride is nice enough to have her still come at all honestly. I'd tell her it would be a good idea to find a cheap dress (TJ Maxx or Ross if you're in the US) and do her makeup in that theme style and utilize accessories to make up for it. In no way should she show up to this wedding in a dress in the same family as white. That is so rude and she needs to get over herself. It's not about her, but the bride. "

"Ignoring the fact that is an inappropriate and creepy basis for naming your child, what it should come down to with any parents is that BOTH parents should be involved in choosing the name and BOTH parents should like it.

There are literally a million names it could be, insist on discussing another name that you both find acceptable. You've been entirely level headed and reasonable in being willing to compromise with it as a middle name, but you shouldn't even have to do that when the name has uncomfortable associations for you. 

He's behaving appallingly frankly - what dad insists on naming their baby girl after their teenage fantasy crush? To be crude for a minute, how many times do you think he's masturbated with this name in mind in the past? Do not accept this. He needs to find another way to deal with his issues."

If (as I suspect) it is the latter, is there a point at which she will stop covering for her mother's irresponsibility?"

"Personally, I would feel uncomfortable naming my kid after a close friend, of either gender, even without any form of infatuation. 


I also think I would be uncomfortable with a friend naming their kid after me. And my name is pretty common. Would she actually be comfortable with your partner naming your daughter after her? Especially because it seems common knowledge that he had a crush on her and she never felt like that towards him? 


Most importantly, of course, is that you don't like the name."

"It's really unfair, but I doubt there is anything you can do to convince her. She's hanging onto her marriage rather than face the fact that for 10 years she's been married to this guy who would hit on her sister. Maybe one day your relationship will recover (if he crosses the line so much she overcomes her denial) but it may never happen.

"It's not your fault that she saw it, assuming that you were in the room with a closed door and she didn't knock.


But you sound ridiculous that you don't understand the difference between a parent and not a parent. Not just the issue of the penis, but the idea that you are a guy who has only known her for a few months. She's known her mom for her entire life, spends every day with her, and trusts her.

You are a guy she met recently, with your penis hanging out. If it's okay for you to be naked around her, why isn't it okay for the guy who owns the grocery store or her teacher or coach or anyone else...male or female. You are not her parent.


I would be pretty pissed for saying it's not a big deal because she has seen HER MOM naked."
"&gt;My wife is absolutely refusing to budge on the issue and won’t try to compromise or muster up any empathy for me. How do I untangle this situation?

Because asking her to ""empathize"" with this situation is basically asking her to side against *herself*. 

Look, I'm not trying to attack you here, because I understand that you're viewing this as ""family is family"", but your parents have attacked both your wife and your marriage repeatedly, and you really haven't gone to bat for your wife from what you've posted. They've accused her of ""stealing"" you, of ""breaking up the family"" - they're explicitly not recognizing the fact that your wife and child are your main family unit now, not your parents. 

You're also making excuses and justifying your parents disrespecting your wife. When your mother went against your wife's explicit wishes for how **your** child is to be raised, you describe how your wife ""lost her damn mind"" whereas your mother was just acting ""reflexively"". That's taking your parent's side and failing to present a united front of you, your wife, and your child. 

I realize that spanking as a disciplinary measure is still hotly contested by many people, and I'll admit that I'm personally firmly against it, but debating the relative value of spanking isn't what the real issue is here. The real issue is that your parents are undermining your marriage, your wife, and demanding to control how *your* children are raised. They're already making **demands** about how they can interact with your child that are centered around discipline - what's next? "
"Tell that 'adult' that he needs to get his adult ass an adult job and pay for his adult bills with all that adult money he will earn.

Edit: this is no disrespect to you, you seem like a wonderful parent. Alex just needs a shock to hopefully help him mature and act like this adult he likes to think he is. "
"You're probably never going to get your mother to really understand this (D/s as a philosophy and lifestyle, I mean). You need to treat this as a damage control situation. ""Roleplay"" is something most people do understand, so you could play up the Fifty Shades of Grey thing. I mean, look, I know no self-respecting D/s person is into that, but it has currency in popular culture in a way that ""real"" D/s doesn't. You could say you saw the movie together and tried it as a roleplay. And honestly, I'd probably say that to the police, if it comes to that, as well - they'll probably ""get it"" better than they would an explanation of D/s.

Oh - and never, ever help your sister in any way ever again. :("
"I'm glad this worked out, but for the love of god, you should definitely still be cautious about his mother.

Edited to add: ...and honestly, him too. People are right, that's a pretty extreme about-face."
"He's obviously monitoring you in some way - either he's installed something on your phone / laptop, or he has put recorders / cameras in a room.

I think the biggest concern for you at this point should not be proving that he did it, because you KNOW he did even if you don't know what or how. *The what or how is not really relevant.* 

What you have to do is decide what do you want to do with this information - what do you think is your best move knowing that your husband is like this? Do you / could you be happy staying with a partner who feels a compulsion to track your every step? 

I would try to communicate with him about it and just say, look, if you lie, then we are going to have problems, and the only way we can salvage this marriage is if you completely come clean about what you've done and why you did it. 

His actions are not simply of someone who wants to verify his wife isn't fucking the poolboy. If that was the case, he'd be clever enough to not clue you into the fact that he's spying. What he's doing is making you feel that no matter what you do, he's going to know and nothing can be run past him. He wants you to think of him as this all-knowing presence, so you feel this voice saying ""anything I do, my husband will know about it, so I better watch myself.""

And that... is no way to live. **That is controlling on his part; not necessarily paranoid, but controlling in a specific type of ""I want you to feel like your every action must be accountable to me"" way.**"
"This is a rough time, but you are saving yourself a lot of stress, anxiety, and time, in the long run.  Future you will thank present you.

You didn't try too late to fix things.  From your original post, you mentioned suggesting to her part time positions and looking over her resume, etc.  She dug her own grave of depression, you are not responsible.

If anything, I would be worried that she will try to get back with you in the next 8 weeks.  

&gt;The worst part is the cloudiness I don't even know where we stand.

This is the one iota of power she left you.  Don't let her keep it.   Don't wait for her to unilaterally decide whether you are still in a relationship or not.  She walked out WITHOUT A WORD, WITHOUT WARNING.  You need to internally realize *you have the power to end this relationship* even when she is not there.  You have the power to start exploring other relationships, even when she hasn't given you the green light. 

And when she comes back to you, don't consider it for a minute.  Put yourself in a position where you love yourself that you won't be convinced by mere ""I'm sorries"".  You will never, and can never, trust her again like you once did.  The relationship is over."

"&gt;her son is her whole world and she just wants him to be happy

Be EXTREMELY cautious about this type of mother.  I'd start setting up boundaries now.  I'd also strongly recommend that your fiance NOT confide in her the intricacies of your relationship, particularly if you are having an argument or rough time -- she WILL go all Momma Bear and make life hell.  He can still have his mother in his life, but he needs to cut the cord already.  Her level of involvement in his personal life is inappropriate."

"OP,  everyone is suggesting things to do to catch him in the act or find the cameras, but you don't really even need to do any of this things. You already have evidence he's spying on you. You already know he's watching somehow. All you have to do is pack a bag, tell him you know about the spying, and leave. He can try to deny it but it doesn't matter: you'll leave this creep and be safe and he'll know he was caught, whether he admits to your face or not. Again, you already have the evidence, now act on it. 

EDIT: lots of great replies here! I too would love the juicy success of finding a camera and shoving the proof in his face to show that I know, and having evidence in divorce proceedings of his behavior, but I think OP's run out of time. He caught her looking for them and knows she's suspicious. He may have taken them down by now or moved on to a more secure form of spying."

"no no no no no.  his mother has NOTHING to do with your marriage and changing/lying about your entire life views is not a solution.  this is a very very bad sign of things to come.  the fact that he's asking you to do this to keep mommy happy means that she will dominate many life decisions.  what happens when you have them kids and she wants them baptized? 

this is definitely deal breaker material and honestly, i wouldn't want to be with a man who would even consider asking me to sacrifice everything I believe and everything he *says* he believes just so mommy is happy.  she's not the one he is marrying. you're the one who is supposed to be happy."
"Great update. Massive kudos to you for being able to dig through some harsh criticism and take it onboard. The counseling is a great idea and you sound like you're both on a better track.

I think you're right that sex is figured out, but you can still have the relationship talk with her - about what a good relationship looks like and how it makes you feel. She's old enough to appreciate her dad talking honestly, and it will do a lot to mend things. Congrats again and good luck with the counseling."
"Email them and ask how they will make things right. Will they un-kick you out of the house? Will they travel back in time to be supportive through your teenage years?

Why on earth did you get married in the first place? That is a laundry list of incompatibilities.
"This is hardly the best way to work through an issue—passive aggressively hiding the keys and avoiding confrontation. Both of you seem a little entitled—you because you think you can do what you want in this marriage with no communication and compromise, and her because she seems to think her shitty driving record has no impact on the car she should be driving, and she seems to be ""sneaking"" the car out behind your back to avoid talking to you about her use of it.

This just reeks of the whole ""money can't buy happiness"" thing. Y'all are well off, your wife is spoiled, and you've gotten a big head from your big income and have a developed a serious ""my way or the highway, end of (or no) discussion"" attitude. Rich people with rich people problems.

Rich people can afford expensive, in-demand marriage counselors. I suggest you make that your next ""dream"" purchase.

**Edit:** Thanks for the gold! Also, I have absolutely no problem with other people's wealth per se, but I do have a pretty big problem with people being so focused on their status symbols and accumulation that they're neglectful of their relationship and are cowardly when it comes to addressing their problems. I'd totally make the same points about hiding the keys (on his part) and taking the car without asking (on her part) if it was a used Honda. The entitlement is located in the fact that both of these people believe their problems should just go away without doing much of the necessary work. Sorry, but offering to ""buy"" the problem away by paying for driving lessons isn't the same as addressing the abuse of trust and communication issues in the relationship. The problem isn't really the car, obviously. A lot of people come to this sub because they can't AFFORD marriage counseling (despite how often it's insisted upon). I'm sorry, but for rich people, that should be a fucking no-brainer."

Please Google domestic violence shelters in your area. You need treatment for your mental health, an escape plan, and help to find work or benefits to help you start again. A shelter can help with all of that. 

Don't spend your life being abused. You've given him ten years, take the next 60 for yourself and your child, please."
"&gt; fyi - the deal always was, she picks the 1st and middle names and my last name. Now she wants to reverse the plan aka I pick the 1st 2 names and she picks the last.

This is kinda stupid. You guys should pick a name together.

As for the last name, it sounds like a pretty reasonable request, knowing what your family is like. It will help you and your chosen family to distance yourself a little from the one you were born into. 

I'd say give her what she wants (or maybe go with an entirely new name) and suggest picking the other names together."

"This isn't a cut-and-dry situation.  You sister had to have known that your conservative Christian parents weren't going to be okay with their daughter choosing a career in in the porn industry.  I'm not anti-porn, but I'm also under no illusions that it's a butterflies-and-rainbows work environment.  

To many people, sex work isn't _just_ a ""career choice that maybe the rest of us wouldn't make.""  It sounds as though your parents have a specific set of moral lines they've drawn for their lives, and they tried to instill those same values in their children -- which is, in essence, a parent's job.  As an adult, you and your sister have rightfully chosen to live with a different set of values, and that's absolutely your prerogative, your right.  In essence, that's your responsibility.  As adults, we SHOULD make our own decisions about the moral code by which we live our lives.  

But our choices all have outcomes and consequences.  Sometimes those outcomes are positive (financial security, personal fulfillment, whatever) and sometimes those outcomes are negative (disapproval from friends and family, harm to future career options, etc).  Your sister's choices have both positive and negative consequences.  

This subreddit has always been very quick to tell women who have done porn, who have been (or are) dancers, who have been sugar-babies, or who have been call girls, that their current or future romantic partners are justified in considering past and current sex work as an absolute deal breaker.   Your parents have the same choice.  Their daughter has made a life choice that is an absolute anathema for them.  Accepting the choices she made would force them to compromise their fundamental belief system. It sounds as though they were tolerant past the point many fundamentalist Christians would have been (with the nude/racy modeling). Although I'm sure it's not easy for them to cut ties with their adult daughter, it's a decision they needed to make for themselves.  They raised her and supported her until her adulthood, but they're not obligated to be supportive of all of her life decisions after that point.  It's not an easy thing or a simple thing. As you said, she's an adult.  She gets to make her own choices. But the other adults in her life aren't obligated to accept and approve of the _choices_ she makes for herself. 

HOWEVER, they don't have the right to require YOU to do the same.  You're right -- you're an adult, and you can decide with whom you associate.  It's good that you are close with your sister, and it's a shame that your parents can't accept that.  "

"You ask your girlfriend's father for permission to marry her, and he tells you that it's her decision, not his. So instead of asking your girlfriend, you go talk to her *brothers* to convince them to get her father to give you permission. They also tell you that it is your girlfriend's decision, and that you should be asking her-- not them. You still don't talk to your girlfriend until she confronts you about why you have been acting weird. 

She breaks up with you, and even still, you say that your desired plan is to ""have  talk with her dad to work things out *and then* have a talk with her."" 

This is why your girlfriend is pissed-- you are insisting that major decisions that affect her life need to be first filtered through the men in her family before you can bring it up with her. "

The most generous way I can interpret this is that she feels insecure about the commitment between you. If she's wanted this item for so long, she probably built a certain image up in her head. It almost sounds like to her it came to have the kind of significance of an engagement ring. 

I think the main thing to look for here is if after she's had time to calm down from her initial disappointment at her expectations not being met if she apologizes to you for her behavior. If she doesn't independently acknowledge that she behaved immaturely and apologize to you for it, I would have serious, significant doubt about her as a partner. 

I mean, I already do, but I'm trying to look at it from the most sympathetic point of view because everyone else (rightly) is going to call her out on being a spoiled brat. "

""My children are missing.  It's not the first time my wife has run off with them randomly, but I don't know where they are or if they're safe.""

I don't really think that a 42-year-old who reacts to marital disagreements by running away from home is someone you can really reason with, but she's also screwing up her kids, as well, by removing them from home and taking them God knows where.

Kids need routine and access to their peers and schooling, not to run away from home.  She's supposed to be modeling how to work through disagreements and giving them a secure nest to live in, not that if someone pisses you off in the slightest way, you unilaterally declare you won't see them anymore.

Tell your children's guidance counselor at school that you didn't authorize the absences, that you have no idea where they are, and you're worried about their mother.

Do your children have mobile phones?  Do they have a way to contact people for their own safety?

"The child molester and multiple criminals with your rare last name are real issues. I suggest considering either a new family name, a slightly altered version of your name, or letting your child have a your wife's name. 

My grandparents in law had a Polish name that was pretty common, and in the 60s grandfather's branch of the family removed the ""ki"" part. Now their name ends just with an s, is just six letters long, and distinguishes that branch of the family from the many other people who have that particular Polish name. It isn't so ""foreign"" sounding and is easier to deal with. 

Considering your personal situation, perhaps shortening your name so it belongs to you and doesn't directly connect with your criminal relatives is a viable solution."

&gt; My sister also mentions that I'm just a dumb slut who wants sex and doesn't think about how I will be hurting the rest of the family.

And I was just like [:D](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4js94s/my_wife_29f_says_she_gets_to_make_100_of_the/d39e58a)"
"Many shelters have a 72 hour hold, just in case of instances like this.

What about the boyfriend who got you the animal despite knowing you lived, at the time, in a dorm for most of the year?

How is your relationship with the landlord? Would he or she be open to discussing making the deposit in payments, a little extra on top of your rent until you make the full deposit?"
"It's his own damn fault for not following the very clear and simple rules you set up for your home.

If this is what broke up a three year relationship, I have a feeling they were already having problems."
"Simple answer. You can say "" I always felt like I wasn't an equal member of this family, you just proved it to me"" 

Or 

"" glad to know you think more of her kids than you do of your own. ""

Edit. Just for the record I think it's bullshit. "
"Dude. You caved, again and again, and she throws her mummy at you.

I dont care if she is having genuine issues finding a job or if she is lazy, and neither should you - by now she needs to be contributing SOMETHING - cash or domestic labour.

Kick the mooch to the kerb, dude

EDIT: doesnt sound like depression"
"You didn't ruin anything.  Sounds like their marriage had some issues before this.  She was snooping, so she's either a suspicious person or he has given her reasons to be suspicious.  

Gary also should have told his wife he was hanging out with you.  I don't mind my husband having lunch with female friends, but he tells me about it.  (Not that I would flip out and divorce him if he didn't though.)

If Gary asks for your help, you can help him, but otherwise stay out of it.  Anything you do will probably only make things worse.  Let him clean up his mess.  If his marriage is really ruined over this misunderstanding, it was on the brink to begin with.  "
"Your mom is awful. Sorry you have to live with her. I would slow things down with Jacob until your dad gets home. Maybe he's the sane one. 

PS she cant force you to get emancipated. You have to go in front of a judge. Just say ""no i do not wish to be emancipated"" adn the judge will call your mom a terrible person and put her in her place

edit: congrats! glad dad came through for you! Update us soon"
He's either an idiot or an asshole. Have you tried talking to him about this?
"As someone who has focused their career on recruitment and HR, I'm not at all surprised that he has only had the one in person interview. If his resume is accurate, it's a giant red flag in and of itself. Who would want him based on his history? His professional behavior sounds like an entitled brat who quits when things don't go his way. 

That's being said, if you are in the Chicago vicinity, please Pm me. "
""" Rebecca, this is hard for me to say, and I've been struggling with my thoughts over this... While I appreciate your intentions, it honestly makes me quite uncomfortable that you're thinking about naming a child after my sister. It's just too soon for me. And frankly, if anyone is going to name a child in her honor, I'd like the opportunity to keep that within my immediate family. I hope you can understand, and reconsider.. If not, I will need some space to think about my ability to be involved in your/your child's life"".

I'd send her a message along those lines and then take my next step (probably outright anger if she refuses, because I totally agree that's just not something she should have decided without talking to you privately first). "

"I'm sorry, but I am a father myself and your father is a weak, shitty person. You have simply become conditioned to have low expectations of him. He is a failure both as a father to you, and as a man in general.

When you become a parent it is for life. You have to understand that to some extent your own personal happiness is contingent on the well-being, both physically and psychologically, of your children. Basically, they come first.

Your father sacrificed your upbringing for a relationship with this woman, just as he is prepared to sacrifice any potential benefits a decent inheritance might make to your future happiness. You are not a priority to him. Personally, I cannot conceive of a situation in which I would not fight tooth and claw for the happiness and prosperity of my own children.

He has and is failing you. Any relationship you maintain with him should certainly take that into account."
"Child Protective Services would love to know how they have abandoned and kicked out their underaged, teenage son for supporting his sister's freedom of religion and suggesting family mediation. I'm sure that'd go over just well.

They will help out with the rest. Financially, it might be tough, but as soon as your brother turns 16 he can start looking for part-time jobs as well, maybe 10-20 hrs/ week (4 hours after school or 8 hours on weekends) or so at retail/fast food and that combined with your income will help solve that.

Right now I think he'd be better in a household with you. You don't have to stay to Oakland forever, just gotta put things on hold a bit until you figure things out. I would sincerely recommend not taking your brother across state lines additionally without full custodial rights. Again, contact CPS immediately and they will help you with what to do.

Lastly, document everything. Any rude comment or declaration of their abandoning/ignoring you and any letter you write to them about your bro, save a screenshot/copy and certify any paper correspondence. It'll help out a lot. Might also want to look into free lawyer consultations as well. Good luck."
"Well, think of it this way... He's now stuck with that nasty piece of work.  And she's with a spineless guy. That sounds like a good punishment for both of them. They deserve each other. "
"Unless you were watching Flowers in the Attic, you're fine."
His parents desire to HIT her. 
"concerning your update about the police, some jurisdictions have criminal ""peeping tom"" laws, and some don't; you could ask a local criminal defense attorney about the laws in your area (edit: in a comment, OP says she is in oregon, which seems to have a nudity requirement in their peeping tom law, so the cops may be correct)

&gt; and could hear them joking around and laughing together

this does not necessarily mean the cops are unserious about this, it can be a tactic to get the guy to loosen up and admit something (they did arrest him)

&gt; He/his company owns the house and I pay rent to him.

this is where you would hit this guy, in tenant / landlord court, going for damages for your costs of moving, etc., plus whatever else you can get (emotional distress, for example). Sadly, there is a large body of jurisprudence on landlords spying on female tenants, usually with very bad outcomes for the landlord.

Find a local tenant-landlord dispute attorney in your area and bring them this case, he/she will be salivating over it, especially with a police report (even if there are no criminal charges)."
"No, you're not being a tool. So many things, where to start?

I'm straight, but as far as I'm concerned sexuality is a private thing, much like politics. As in, yes you might be open with friends and you may choose to shout about it from the rooftops, but that's your choice. Nobody else should be announcing your personal stuff anywhere, let alone online. 

Second, asking for money for the wedding - first faux pas. Asking for a contribution to the honeymoon or a first home *as a wedding gift* in lieu of a toaster is fine, but it's assumed the wedding is something the couple (or their parents) can afford. Otherwise, go for a registry and keep it simple. 

Third, asking for a gift from people you've not even invited to the wedding. What?!! 

Fourth, asking for a gift *repeatedly*. 

Fifth, pocketing the money! It was bad enough that it was supposed to be for the wedding, but for the wedding to suddenly not happen and the cheques still get cashed, that's just rude. 

Sixth, piggybacking on a cause which, while a great thing to support, is entirely inappropriate, since I believe being gay doesn't automatically mean that someone wants marriage for themselves. 

I suspect, being very kind here because seriously what planet is she on?, that the wedding has been suspended for other reasons and she didn't want to disclose them. Instead, she turned to a very public issue to deflect attention from whatever the real reason is. "
"&gt; She was freaking out, saying he was hitting on her and touching her/trying to touch her and she had told him to stop and he wouldn't back off, so she screamed at the top of her lungs for me to come. 

And just like that, the rest of your sister's life was changed forever. All of her future relationships have been impacted. This is exactly the trauma that should have been prevented. This was a legitimate sexual assault, and it's not too late to call the police. He isn't just creepy. He is a sexual assault criminal.

&gt;  My sister was way on edge for the next week, way more cranky and irritable than usual, I didn't blame her. She still wanted to move out, she said she hated living at home after everything that happened, she didn't feel safe. I told her the dude wasn't coming back, but she still wanted me to move out with her. She said stuff like ""you don't really love me, I knew it, I don't love you either"", stuff like that which was clearly attempting to guilt me and which I felt was extremely childish and immature.

These are all totally normal reactions to being sexually assaulted. She will do and say whatever she has to in order to get out of the dangerous situation that got her assaulted. You call her childish, but it worked. Everyone finally took her seriously enough to get her out of the situation. Since no one took the necessary steps to make sure she didn't get sexually assaulted, she had to behave in ways she is not proud of in order to take care of herself. That would make anyone cranky.

It's great that you stopped things from going further, and that you are moving out with her. I don't mean to detract from that. I just want you to be prepared for the full emotional fallout for the trauma she experienced. She would greatly benefit from some quality counseling. She will continue to exhibit behaviors that may seem childish or irrational. It may take a lot of patience, and she probably has some buried resentment that may feel unfair to you."
"&gt;He is adamant that I not cut my hair because of it's ""value"" and because I would be ""taking it away"" from him.

You are not a thing. Your value is not determined by your hair length. You don't need to ""respect"" his demands for what you do with your appearance.

&gt;He's even said that he wouldn't be able to wait for it to grow back

You've been with this guy four months, so even the sunk cost fallacy can't really apply here. 

I do want to say that I know where you're standing as far as the dramatic nature of the cut.  The longest my hair's ever been was about three inches above my knees, and the most severe cut I ever got was when I went into the bathroom (after more than a year of considering it) and chopped my braid off near my ears with kitchen scissors. The braid was longer than my arm. So I'm not going to say ""It's just a haircut!"" because something that drastic really can be very surprising.

And freeing, and awesome, and it feels great.

(Just don't do what I do, and automatically make that head-toss to pull it all over your shoulder at once. I actually pulled a muscle in my neck.)

If telling him you're cutting your hair makes him threaten you like this...well, he's not worth much."
"My huge suggestion in addition to doing this is focus on him. Before you give him the plan tell him  you know this is very hard for him, offering taking him to therapy about it; maybe try to give him a break or do something sweet for him. Then hand him the plan and said you helped come up with one since you know this must be the hardest thing he's dealt with.

While it's a burden and it's technically unfair, he is basically losing his mother to a cruel disease and he probably hates losing the last bit of time with her before she completely forgets him. He probably puts it off a day at a time, because facing the reality is killing him."
"calculate a rough estimate of what she owes you and ask your dad if he is willing to deduct it from her next month's spending money. Write her a letter explaining how hard you work, how devastated you are, and how badly she's shattered your trust. Lay out the terms you agree upon with dad. Tell her why you love her, but that she needs to get help if she wants to continue to be a major part of your life. 

Your mom is seriously ill, and addicted. Shopping addictions are no joke. Meth ruins your teeth, but a good shopping addiction will ruin your entire identity and credit history forever.

 But these are reasons, not excuses. You are old and wise enough now to know that setting boundaries in regards to toxic behavior is the best course of action. Else, you end up like your father- swallowing the lies and the disrespect time after time."
Sounds like one big scam to make money. You should comment on her post asking her to donate all of her monetary gifts to charity..with proof.

"Seriously.  I can understand verbally confronting her, but to immediately jump to physical attack?  That woman is unhinged."
The fact that you wanted to take the most considerate approach possible and that your brother and SIL were immediately happy for you despite their loss shows just how solid your family is. Congratulations and best wishes!
"I'll give you some insight from someone whose actually ABC and spent part of his life on serving his parents (among other things).

Filial piety really sucks, especially when you have a Reddit thread that doesn't understand the full extent of this burden. With that being said, you do not need to acknowledge it if they haven't asked you directly, because they know how wrong it is. The feeling is mutual in doing the best for your parents, it doesn't mean you have to put yourself in a hole for their irresponsibility though. It means you need to spend a bit of time and measure how much you're willing to spend in terms of money and/or time as a daughter with a realistic perception of who you wanna be when you turn 30 (you're almost there!). Their bad decisions are still existent in terms of living lavishly, so the first step you can take in helping them is offering to assess their overall financial situation to see how much you can do, instead of going all-in without a safety net."
"The problems communication, from day one you've considered it 'my' car and she's considered it 'our' car. There's no right or wrong here, you just need to talk it through and come to a compromise like adults because hiding the keys and having arguments in a household with 3 cars is just silly.

Just because you're married with kids doesn't mean you can't have nice things, but for better or worse, you will probably have to share those nice things."
"You need to talk to an outside adult. You have to let someone know this is going on, you won't be able to combat your moms behavior by yourself. Addicts are addicts and will do anything and everything to get their fix. "
"&gt;Am i or is she being unreasonable?

She is. 

Your house, your mouth, your food choices. She can't tell you what to keep in the house. Especially as you're doing her the favor of letting her kid stay with you after school.

This kid is too old to have other people imposing his diet on him. What is your SIL gonna do when he goes to college or starts living on his own in a few years? "
"Yes, trying to be just friends with him while you're infatuated with him is a terrible idea. Also, this?

&gt;guy #1 doesn't want a girlfriend right now, wants me to give him space for a few months, **and then will most likely want to be with me after all that.**

is the flimsiest promise imaginable. Pretend he's dead and start dating other people. I know it hurts, and he doesn't seem like a bad guy, but you want really different things. "
"If you aren't even engaged yet, I don't see why she just assumes you'll get married? Putting that aside, I think you went about it the smart way. If you got your initials/last name and you didn't end up getting married the gift would be useless and probably thrown out. If you DO end up getting married, her maiden initials/last name will ALWAYS mean something to her. No one would judge her for using something that was monogrammed with her ""old"" last name but if you broke up, she certainly couldn't keep using something monogrammed with YOUR last name. In my opinion, she's being beyond ""kind of"" spoiled and that shit is a red flag. "
No she doesn't. And her initials with my last name make an ugly word (RAT) so I don't know why she would want that monogrammed onto anything. 
"Your poor Dad. My heart really goes out to him. He's had a big setback, but if you're there for him then I have hopes it will get better. Keep encouraging him, and hopefully he'll go back to his therapist. "
What is this world coming to where people ghost their partners of over a year. That's unbelievably callous. 
"Tell him it makes you uncomfortable and you don't want your daughter having the same unique name as someone he used to be infatuated with. Who cares if he says they're 'just friends' now? That doesn't matter. You don't want the name to be your baby's name. End of. Find a name you both like. 

Edit: there's a difference between naming a kid after a close friend. It's another thing to name it after some woman your husband can't get over. "
"""This is my half brother, his mom died and he came to live with us.""

THAT IS ALL ANYONE NEEDS TO KNOW. 

Everything else is family business. If someone asks more questions, wants more information, DON'T TELL THEM. ""Why do you want to know?"" ""I'm not comfortable telling you this."" ""That is family business."" ""It's not my story to tell."" ""Does it matter?""

Don't feed into the drama, don't feed people's nosiness. Be a brick wall of silence. 

Telling your friends and acquaintances the dirty details will create more turmoil for you. It's not going to make you feel better because in the long run someone will blab and then the whole school will know your family's private business. Then people are going to look at you funny and talk behind your back. You and your family will become a joke. As angry as you are with your parents now, hearing people laugh at your family is going to hurt. Ignore the impulse to talk to anyone who is not a therapist or your parents. Even if you trust your BFF, this is the kind of secret that becomes ammunition if she gets angry at you. You have a lot of time in high school to get through and keeping your mouth shut is the smartest move. "
"It hurts because it shows a complete lack of respect and also that she was so smugly convinced of her own ""rightness"" that she felt it was okay to talk about you behind your back. She didn't even bother to really consider what you were saying to her. 

A common phrase on here is that when someone shows you who they are, believe them. Keep that in mind, I'm sure you may have a moment of weakness at one point or the other because it's hard when you love someone so much. She showed you a side of her that makes her a poor partner and parent. "
This says it all. OP's wife sounds insufferable.
"It's ok to be single. Is not ok to feel unsafe in your own relationship. She made you feel unsafe. That's never ok.

"He cheated on you once already. Then he hired a prostitute, lied to you about it when you confronted him, and then claimed he wasn't going to follow through with it while sitting in the hotel room he booked for exactly that purpose once he realized he was caught. And you're considering giving him another chance?

These are the two instances of cheating *that you know of.* I'll bet you anything there have been more, and either way he's demonstrated that he has no qualms about lying to you to cover his ass. A grown man who respects his partner shouldn't need three chances to not do that.

I'd dump him and get tested for STIs right away. "
"Let's say that you didn't have a twin and you *were* cheating on him.  As shitty as that would be, it'd still be completely insane for her to hit you.  There's no justifying this.  "
"Piggybacking the top comment to say, yes absolutely cut out the boyfriend and do whatever you want with your hair but DO research hair donation charities and make sure your hair is actually going to leave the floor of the salon. I remember reading about places that never send the hair to the charity (I think it's mainly places like great clips?). 

Have fun in Spain! "
"&gt;We colloquially refer to it as the dick pic war.

"
"&gt; Easy, right? I tell him ""Look, I am going to buy a clock to put next to your bed"" and he freaks out.    

Posters here are all like, oh buy  him a phone and problem is solved. My Q. how would that be different from the solution proposed by OP. Btw, WHAT is with this disproportionate response. WHY doesnt he want the clock. Have you asked OP what is his problem using a clock ???

ETA: I'd be hopping mad if someone woke me up every day early morning. I usually dont fall asleep again and thats precious time lost tossing &amp; turning &amp; getting tired early. You are a saint to put up with this shit for so long"
This is the cutest fucking thing I've ever seen. [throws rainbow confetti]
"Perfect. The clock is only a symptom of a much more serious problem.

I mean, not only OP's post already shows that there is something very wrong with her boyfriend, but the comments here still give more information about it.

* 1) He doesn't have a phone.
* 2) Everyone calls him out for it. 
* 3) He is a 28 year old business professional with no cell phone.
* 4) He insists on doing something that is bad for OP.
* 5) He FREAKS THE EFFING OUT when confronted.

This is **not normal**. His reaction is absurd, there is something fundamentally wrong in his behavior. I would say that this is already serious enough issue to seek for the help of a therapist, he has some very serious problem hidden inside his head.

"
"What your mom did was illegal. You should call CPS and report her for two reasons. 1) your brother may be able to get some kinship benefits from the state for fostering you which will ease his financial burden and 2) you normally need your parents tax info to file a FAFSA and get financial aid for college, however this could change based on your legal status and could be a huge advantage as it sounds like your parents make too much for you to get aid, but you may now qualify."
"This. I think it's very easy for able-bodied people to see people with physical disabilities as people who need our pity and/or protection, when in fact, most of them just want to be treated like anybody else. Push aside the fact that she has a physical disability and think carefully about how you feel about this person."
"My reaction would be strongly based on how your husband is framing his concerns. 

If he's being overbearing and forbidding you from going, I feel like that's an issue on its own. 

But if he's saying this like I assume - worried about his wife and unborn child taking a distant trip to a strange place completely alone and unprotected - then I can see more where he's coming from. You're not some helpless little girl of course, but can't you see his concern for you?

I must admit I do find it odd you have this dream-induced fixation and your counselor has interpreted it in such a way and suggested you follow what seems like a very impulsive whim. Dream interpretation is controversial, and only specially trained psychologists will even touch on it at all. 

Have you considered your husband's feelings in all this? I'm not saying either of you is right or wrong, but you seem to have this oddly obsessive whim which your therapist supported, and it sounds like your husband has some pretty valid and reasonable concerns. Travel is physically and mentally taxing. Maybe he's just worried about his wife and child's well-being. Traveling while pregnant can be an iffy subject. 

So sit down and talk to him about this, about his concerns, and really listen. I get the feeling your mind is already made up, though. 

I don't think you're unreasonable for wanting to experience something alone, and I dot think your husband is unreasonable to be concerned about your well-being. "
"Seriously?  I'm about 40, and am laughing my ass off at this post, it sounds hilarious.  Since when does being an adult preclude harmless fun with friends?

"Look.  There's no way you could have known you guys would have ended up on the same flight.  Dont play games or try to scheme.  Just board the plane, go to your seats, fly, go about your business. "
"To me, that definitely isn't worth it. Why spend what precious little time you have with someone so childish? She gets pleasure out of making you feel bad -- what kind of partner is that?

Surround yourself with friends and family. Having this one for support, you might as well be hanging off a cliff with a piece of twine."
"This is what's confusing. When I was unemployed and my SO was covering most bills for us, you bet that he came home to a clean, vaccumed house and dinner on the table (well, not dinner, he was home at 3 PM but dinner was made by me)!

When he was unemployed he fell into a rut, but he still tidied up, did the dishes and did grocery shopping if I asked him to. I still cooked dinner, but we split the work in a way where we neither of us felt overwhelmed. 

When in a relationship, you're a team. You don't let your teammate play offense and defense as you stand around and do nothing, you do your share. "
I'd charge her with theft... Wow she was so completely out of line. She's literally tried to ruin your life and is using something she stole from you to do it. I'm so sorry.

"A seven year old is not going to understand your reasons.  She wants to live with you because you're cool and have dogs - she's not old enough to really get all the complex adult reasoning.  She's also just suffered a major trauma which is going to cloud her judgement.

Don't try to explain too much.  Reiterate that you love her and you'll be happy for her to come visit you and your dogs sometimes, but that Jody is the best mom, and that while Jody and her husband will never replace Tegan's mom and dad, they can give her a better life than you can.  Don't try to reason with Tegan - it's not going to work.  Be sensitive, but come at it from a ""this is the way things are going to be now"", rather than trying to get her total understanding and cooperation.

Tegan's going to cry and feel rejected - there isn't much you can do about that.  Visit when you can, talk to her a lot.  As she gets older, she'll understand more.  

I do recommend that Tegan gets a good child psychologist, one that specializes in grief, if she doesn't have one already.  Having a good therapist can make a world of difference for a child in Tegan's situation, and they'll be trained to help her with this transition, and coming to terms with her new life.  Her school should have resources, or at least contact information, if you need it."
Jasper is a better name for a dog than a person anyway.
You communicated your problem and she chose to ignore it and dismiss your feelings rather than validating them and making steps to fix the relationship. You have made the right choice in leaving.
"I think it is a ring.

I think he wants to go, but can't afford to now.  He wants her to stay in solidarity.  He just can't tell her without running the surprise.

He hinted at this with the justification - would you go alone if we were married?

 I think he's stressed himself out in the finances and is being dumb. Unlike the current top post, I don't think this is a relationship killer. Just talk to him more and outline why you're concerned and see if he comes around.

I could be wrong, though, there's a lot of speculation here."

"I know you've developed something of a protective attitude toward her, but she is still an educated, worldly adult.  If she says that she wants to pursue something, don't second guess her, she is capable of taking care of herself in this respect.

That being said, it may still be productive for both of you to talk about this, but don't do so in such a manner that it seems like the continuation of the relationship is contingent upon this concern being addressed.  Ask her if she's okay with this, tell her how you feel, and let her tell you that it's alright.  If she does, believe her, she the best authority in this regard."
"Eventually she will start harassing or potentially threatening the kids, and that will be a much much larger issue than going to the police now. You have enough evidence and just cause to get a restraining order against her for both you and your niece and nephew. It's genuinely not a dramatic process, and could guarantee everyone's safety. For their sake as well as yours, take that step. "
"OP, listen to your mother and think very very carefully how and if you proceed with this marriage. This is your fiancé putting his mother's feelings about what seems ""proper"" to her over your very valid feelings about your father and this whole situation.

"Sorry, OP, but THIS:

&gt; Michael hasn't texted me.

...is the crux of it. 

Michael didn't call/text **you** to tell **you** that it is a joke... that was just his response on facebook to the people posting there.

**Even if** it *was* just a joke, Kayla and he are just platonic friends, etc... and **even if** he didn't make this facebook joke but another of his friends (Kayla or otherwise) did it on his computer when he wasn't looking... then still any caring boyfriend would have contacted you ASAP and explained it to you to set your mind at ease. 

But instead of thinking *""oh geez, someone made a stupid relationship joke on my facebook... Oh god, what would OP think I bet her call her right away to explain!""*, the thought hasn't even occured to him to remember that he is in a relationship, to think about you, his girlfriend, or your feelings whatsoever.

So there you go, shitty boyfriend who doesn't care about you.

Then you add in the rest of your post, with Michael *at best* not setting boundaries with his friend Kayla and not caring how that would make you feel (or at worst a much bigger betrayal)... well then he's even more of a shitty boyfriend who doesn't care about you and your feelings. 

Sorry if that came out a bit harsh, OP, but this is a really shitty situation and you need the truth. Take back your heart from this man, he doesn't deserve to have it.

"&gt;Because you got pregnant

&gt;Well, you got pregnant

&gt;I’m getting the feeling that he’s upset that I took our time away from him.

Yeah, uh. He fucked you. You didn't just ""get"" pregnant, magically, as though spontaneous generation were a thing.

Both of you agreed that you wanted children. Both of you had sex knowing that hormonal BC has a failure rate.   He chose not to use a condom, even though he's an adult who knows that semen causes pregnancy.

He needs to pull up his diaper and _deal_ with this."
"I really just want to say that tall guys often sit like this because anything else is uncomfortable. Next time you have the chance, sit down in a chair meant for children and notice where your legs end up. "
He's not even sorry about it.
"Anybody who sneaks unknown items into your food should be dumped yesterday and given a restraining order.

Edit: just noticed your ages. congratulations you've just dated your first narcissist. Use him as an example of ""guys to run away from""."
"Wait. So you said that as long as you're alone you'd have a chef and maid, but if you move in together you won't. Does that mean you expect HER to perform all the chef and maid services? Or do you mean that you'll start doing that work as soon as she moves in with you? If it's the latter, she probably wants proof that you're capable. If it's the former, she has good reason to be worried.

Your living arrangements while you're not living together aren't any of her business as such, but she has reason to be concerned about what it means for your future life together."
"You need to take steps to keep Olivia safe. Your son is an adult who is going out of his way to hurt another person who has never done him any harm. You tried to be a good parent by giving into him in terms of your relationship for most of his life. He thinks that you'll do the same now. You can't help him right now. You need to protect her. 

Be prepared for him to escalate. Sit down with your wife and Olivia and come up with a plan for how to keep everyone safe and what to do if violence occurs. 

Beyond that ask your son's girlfriend and friends what he's been saying about her. It's possible that his mom turned him against Olivia a long time ago and getting to the bottom of that might be helpful, but must be secondary to her current safety. "
"My wife is allergic to walnuts. I have never in the past 13 years ever brought home or desired walnuts because I don't want to make her sick or die.

What are you going to do if you have kids with him and they also have the allergy? Not that it's likely but still...."
"You don't pay rent. You don't buy groceries. You have a stash of chocolate you keep hidden away and you still manage to eat all the other chocolate in the house. Is your dad supposed to hide chocolate from you in his own house? 

Do you do your own chores and cleaning? They are probably getting tired of you sponging."
"It's so freaking creepy how adamant they are to spank her like it's some form of a hobby.

I thought the unspoken rule is that the grandparents are just there to nurture. It's the actual parents' jobs to also discipline and build structure.

That's so whack to think of my grandparents as wanting to spank me. The hellllll."
"I'm sure we all realize this passive-aggressive approach is a joke (and a funny one), but I *would* do something similar.

OP, just tell your wife that she's right, you wanted the house. Tell her you're selling it and you two can both look for a place to rent together, with each paying exactly half of the rent. Then tell her everything is going to be split right down the middle - any bills related to the apartment (heat, electric, cable, etc), phone bills, groceries, eating out, and fun activity you two do together, etc. 

Basically just tell her that since she wants separate finances, this is what it means. Perhaps you two can also agree on mutually contributing to retirement accounts. Oh also, because you wanted the house and have been paying for it, you get all of the equity (if there is any) when you sell, okay?"
"If you are planning on ending the friendship to me it makes sense to tell him why politely. Either he uses the information to make life better, or he gets pissed and doesnt want to be friends anymore. Either way it's good for you and had a potential to help a friend out"
"&gt;She cried for a long time and when she was able to speak she thanked me.

This broke my heart. "
"That math is clearly a compromise between them, so don't expect to see a penny if your dad predeceases her. If your dad brings it up again I would just laugh and tell him you would appreciate it if stops pretending you will ever inherit any of the money. Tell him that he knows very well how his wife's considers you vs her own kids and that you are sick of being asked to play a part in the charade. You are not half of a son and it insulting to bring it up.  If that was the best compromise they could reach when the inheritance is so far away, you are sure that she will get her way by the end. There is no point in discussing money you will never see."

"It's easier for your sister to blame you than to admit that she's married to a creep. :/  

&gt; One night I fell asleep on the couch, and I woke up because he put his hand on my thigh

You are not safe there and need to get away. Your sister does not have your back and her marriage may need to crash and burn (without you in the picture) for her to have a reality check. I'm so sorry you're having to deal with this shitty situation. :("
"He was hiding in the shower after that girl whose hips he just squeezed rushed out and ignored you as you come up? That's extremely shady and tbh and for me I'd break up with him. 

You know he wasn't drunk, and even if he was alcohol is no excuse. The lying is just even more insulting because he's basically insinuating that you're too daft to figure it out all while trying to have his cake and eat it too. I'm enraged for you OP, sorry. :( "
"This would be my worry, too. He clearly is obsessive (constantly watching these cams) and paranoid (why else would he put up the cams in the first place)? He immediately got cold and angry when he thought she wasn't telling him the full truth. I'm honestly pretty nervous for OP, this is absolutely not behavior that strikes me as stemming from a healthy mind."
Absolutely. She's lucky your sister isn't pressing charges for assaulting her in public and with many witnesses. Your boyfriend better take his mother in hand about this.
"&gt; After she was born they actually hired a lawyer and tried to sue us for partial custody of her. THAT'S how seriously they take being grandparents.

This isn't ""being grandparents"", this is batshit crazy levels of control and manipulation. 

They literally tried to use a lawyer to force their way into your family in order to get what they want. Holy shit. Your wife is 100% correct to avoid having your parents around, because they're toxic, overbearing, manipulative, and possessive. "
"You're never getting the shoes man, but you learned something about your girlfriends personality and I think that's worth writing a song over. "
"You seem to put an unusual amount of emphasis on appearances. 

You mention how your marriage fell apart mostly because your wife stopped caring about her appearance. 

You mention how when you were finally divorced, started looking online and marveled at how young, beautiful women would reply to your messages. Hint: Most likely has nothing to do with your appearance and everything to do with other reasons (Plenty of women lookin for a father figure out there). 

You can't help to stress how great is the make up advice that this 12-year-younger, soon to be step mom bestows upon your daughters. (How old are they? Not mentioned here).

And finally.. you are concerned about the light in which your ex-wife paints you.

If I were you, I would focus my energy on building a meaningful relationship with my current woman rather than worry what my ex says (with merit or not) about our motivations to break up.

Move on. She is doing so in the best way she can. And frankly, while is not the best, at least it makes more sense than your own account."
"That's how I am. I completely shut down around mentally challenged people and children. After some soul searching, I think it's actually because I'm worried how other people will judge me for not interacting properly. I watched a very young cousin on my own and felt much more comfortable and got along great. "
"Yes. A frequent refrain in r/relationships is ""You don't have a mother-in-law problem, you have a husband problem"" when there is a problematic relative but also a husband/wife/etc. who is unwilling to defend the OP from toxic relations.

It is really horrifying that your toxic person is your own mom. Molesters are awful, but moms who turn the other cheek are also awful.

I really do wish you and your sister the best of luck. You are lucky to have each other."
Why are you letting us know? Just dump her already. 
I've considered this. I just didn't know if I was being too paranoid. 
He's been pulling this trump card for a long time. Don't replace mom with Michelle. Dad complies. I don't want to see Olivia anymore. Dad complies. The dad has been a doormat for a long time. I feel bad because it's clear he really loves his son. 
"It sounds to me like sex has become a chore or obligation to her, instead of the enjoyable activity it should be. She may have a much much lower libido than you do. To you, the list of suggestions you gave was probably meant to be fun and exciting, to help to spice things up. To her, it may look like a list of demands and obligations. Not so much of a turn on. I would let go of your wish for her to initiate sex on your anniversary weekend, and focus on enjoying each other and reconnecting. You need to get to a place where sex isn't a chore or list of demands for her before it's realistic to expect her to initiate regularly."
"""dropped off the radar around 9pm and didn't answer his phone until almost 3am.""

He slept with her that night on his trip and he's been doing it ever since."
"If you're ready to take Jack in: ""Hey Dad, in your words, maybe *you* should man the fuck up, leave your idiotic high school mentality behind, and support your obviously very talented and successful son. It takes a great deal of skill and practice to do what he does (not at all unlike football), and the only thing you're doing is driving *both* your children away with your shitty attitude. If you don't want to support him, I'll gladly have him move in with me, and we'll get out of your hair permanently.""

I mean, before you make that offer, you should probably check on the legality of your ability to make and follow through with it, and also maybe get adults from Jack's school on your side, but if he's the kind of guy to not to let how his words affect others stop him, I don't think you should let his feelings stop you, either. (Hell, were I you, I'd throw a few punches about your mom in there, and how she wouldn't stand for this shit. On the one hand, he may be getting worse because of grief, though you don't address their relationship outside of fights over Jack. On the other hand, sounds like your dad's just always been an asshole about it.)

I would also remind your brother that history has a long tradition of celebrating talented musicians, and that his dedication and talent are to be praised."
"So, you married a man whose kids you didn't know well despite the fact that you've been in their lives since they were 13 and 16? That doesn't seem smart and it's not the kids fault. His kids aren't causing the problems. You and your husband created the situation by failing to ensure you had a great relationship with them before you ever considered marriage. You should all go to counseling before you pull the plug on this marriage."
"Wow, that last paragraph was vivid, but probably needed, I do need to stand my ground on this. "
"No, you shouldn't ""let the name thing go"". There's a big difference between compromising and caving.


Has he explained why exactly it's so important for him to have this child (assuming its a girl) named after him?


I know it's the go-to answer in this sub, but couples' counseling would be a good idea in advance of the baby arriving. In addition to being a good idea in general, considering you're planning a future together and the baby wasn't exactly planned itself, a third party will hopefully make Adam Senior realize how inconsiderate he's being."
"Red flag went off when I read ""his friends Jim Beam and Jack Daniels"". Does he drink every night? Your question is ""how can i make him understand that it wasn't ok"" - sorry to say, but you already tried. He didn't listen or care. He has no respect for you. I'm also worried it could escalate into something dangerous... I agree with the other posters,  he sounds like an asshole and you need to leave. "
"You haven't ever had sex in ten years, yet you're concerned about the kind of mother she'd be......are we expecting the second coming of Christ?  Why is this even on your mind considering your situation?"
"Absolutely. There's a Maya Angelou quote I love that fits this situation pretty well: *When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.*

Cut your hair, cut out your boyfriend and have a fantastic summer in Spain."
"Cut off all contact with Brandon or file for divorce.  Anything other than those two options is pure selfishness.  What you are doing to your husband - flaunting your emotional affair in his face - is beyond cruel.  Depression is not an excuse to be a jerk.  Quit pretending like you're taking the high road by being open and honest because that's bull.  You're just torturing your husband.

If you don't want to be with Tim, don't.  But that means you have to stop using him for whatever he provides.  Pack your stuff and go."
"I tell my grandmother (who also has alzheimer's) that my grandfather (who died last year) stepped out to run an errand.  She can really only remember about 15 minutes at a time.  Sometimes if I'm having a hard time getting her in the bath or something, I'll say ""Well, we want to be cleaned up for when your husband comes home, right?""  Which I know is kind of sneaky but it works when nothing else will.

It is pointless to make her go through the emotional trauma of learning about his death over and over again.  Much kinder, in my opinion, to tell a little lie.  "
"It will be your money and you can do what you want with it. 

In your shoes, I would split it 50/50, and if my sister objected, I'd tell her that it was more of a big middle finger to Dad than charity for her. She can donate it to a cat hospital in New South Wales or something if she doesn't want it. 

Edit: Don't lie. None of this is likely to be a surprise to her."
"Don't move in with her while she is still with Isagenix.

Don't financially support her while she is still in. Typical boyfriend stuff like movies and dinner are okay, but don't pay for insurance, rent, etc.

Go over how she hasn't made a penny during her entire time there."
Sounds like she's making a vegan recipe for driving her own son away
"It sounds like Isaac didn't communicate with his girlfriend where he would be or who he would be with, then she asked her brother to follow him to the karoake bar, where she saw the two of you outside.  If that is the case, it would probably seem like cheating to her.  If he'd told her that he was going out with you, she'd have voiced her problem with it beforehand, not in front of the bar, so there's a good chance he was hiding it from her, which is pretty sketch.

Her reaction is fucking crazy too, obviously, don't get me wrong.

Also:

&gt;nor do anything that could possibly spark jealousy as I have faced these problems numerous times with Isaac's ex-girlfriends when I did not care so much about them, they were bitches

If Isaac has numerous girlfriends who've been jealous of you, either he has terrible taste in women, or there is something about your relationship and the way you and he interact that makes his girlfriends uncomfortable."
"Important to remember though.. be as little burden as you can be.

"I don't know why Kayla is acting like she just won the lottery.

"Learn to stand up for your wife and your family. If your family is ready to disown you over this issue, then they aren't good people to have in your life. As parents, you get the final say how to raise your child. Your parents are completely disrespectful of that fact and if they can't deal with not being able to spank your child, that's their issue. But, your wife isn't driving a wedge through your family. Your parents are with their unreasonable demands. "
"her wife isn't the biological mother, and i'm fairly certain you can't adopt a child before it's born, so i see now way she could have any legal ties to the child at all."
"&gt;figured every guy needs dick photos of himself stashed away somewhere...

Guy here.  Have no dick pics stashed.  "
Have you considered that the only reason that your dad reached out might be because your cousins have moved out and/or have lessened contact with your parents? It could just be that you're still second to them but they're willing to take you back since they can't get what they want from your cousins.
"""Boyfriend, this not the first, or even the tenth, time you forgot. Your claim that you just keep forgetting is starting to stretch the limits of plausibility. Usually, people only forget things again and again if they don't think it's actually important. So, what can drill it into your head that this is actually important?""

You're right to feel hurt. He's sending you the message that you're not that important - when he buys food for the two of you, he's not thinking about what needs to happen to actually include you. I can't know why he keeps doing it (covert hostility towards your allergy? just doesn't care very much?), but it's a thoroughly crappy behavior.

Honestly, I would consider creating consequences when he does it in the future. Don't, like, be spiteful, but consider saying something like ""I've told you again and again I'm allergic to walnuts, and you keep forgetting. That really hurts, so I'm going to [go upstairs/take a walk/hang out with a friend] for a few hours to calm down. I'll see you soon"". I wouldn't want to turn this into some kind of escalating punishment thing, but I do think he'll magically get a lot less forgetful if he realizes that giving you walnuts will have consequences for him.

Edited to add: it might also be worth asking him point blank if he believes your allergy is no big deal. His behavior is consistent with someone who thinks that people with allergies are faking or exaggerating."
"This would be my hill to die on, to be honest, and the wording suggested is good. It IS disrespectful to you. Even if he had never had a crush on her, you need to pick a name both of you are comfortable with.
"
"It's definitely hypocritical of her to make you wear shorts while she leaves the door open while only wearing a thong or less.

"I have been in a position similar to your wife's before.

In my case, relationship issues were getting in the way of me being in the mood. I didn't mind when he initiated, because him expressing a desire for me was enough to get me over the mental ""hump,"" but without that I just wasn't in the mood for sex at all. I didn't really feel wanted and appreciated in our everyday life, and that was translating to a lack of desire on my part.

We talked about it, and that really made things worse. He had a list of things he wanted from me/wanted me to do. That, lumped on top of me not feeling appreciated in everyday life, made me feel like a sex object more than a loved and respected partner. I felt like he was using me to fulfill his sexual wish-list, rather than truly wanting to be with *me.* There was always an undertone of ""If you care about me/this relationship then why is it so hard to follow through on these things,"" which made me resent him for being so demanding when it came to sex. He couldn't see that, with me not being in the mood, having sex when he initiated WAS a compromise, and that by heaping on the demands and guilt it was making things worse, not better.

Now, I really don't know if your wife is of a similar mindset or not, but, like I said, I was in a similar position before and this was why.

For your anniversary, I think, if you're set on celebrating with sex, you should plan to initiate it yourself. Then, on a no-pressure later date, you can talk about other areas of your relationship, and try to figure out if these things are tangentially related to her decline in sexual interest."

He's basically asking you to put your romantic life on hold for him while he figures his shit out, without any guarantee of the relationship that you want. You're an option for him. "
"Yes.  He pretty much said we were entitled to our own opinions and should just agree to disagree.  Works for stuff like favorite foods and who's the hottest person in Hollywood, here not so much."
"This is seriously unprofessional of your boss. Who you date and live with is none of their business. Additionally, its not on your social media profile(since you don't have one) so you are in no way representing the company in a bad light.

Before your meeting, find your bosses profile and send a link to all your family and friends so they can block her. If she didn't take any screen shots and she has no access to any of their profiles then you might be able to play dumb and ask her for proof. Do not give her any information about your private life that she does not already know.

Try talking to r/polyamory. Someone there might have gone through something similar.

"Your mom does sound controlling and manipulative. A nice, caring mother wouldn't say things like 

&gt;She compared me to my dad, who I have a poor relationship with, and said that if I was on her team I’d support her and that she couldn’t believe I was going against her. 

It took me awhile to realize my mother was controlling/verbally abusive. I didn't want to admit those things because she had convinced my sister and I that my father was abusive to her, and in fact he wasn't, she was the abusive one. I had to grow up to realize that. We don't always see what is really there, and convince ourselves that everything is okay.

It may take a while to realize what your friend is saying is the truth, but when you do it'll be so much better."

"Quite frankly, I think you come off rather poorly here.

-You didn't lock the door.

-You didn't cover up when the little girl walked in.

-You stand there with your dick hanging out while she looks at it.

-You pretend like you don't understand the difference between a child seeing a same-sex parent naked and an unrelated, opposite-sex acquaintance.

Your GF has every right and reason to be upset with you."
"Your parents are being absolute assholes about this, but they're also dealing with a daughter whose deliberate disobedience and straightfaced lying cost someone their life. Their image of their perfect over-achieving well-behaved little girl has been shattered, and regardless of the way they've been acting, they've had a justifiable shock and they're probably floundering right now. 

You're also enabling your sister. You knew and she knew that the lake was dangerous even without adding unsupervised underage alcohol use into the equation; she knew exactly why her parents had said no--not because they were being killjoys but because it was a fucking dangerous situation. She's not a child. She's 17, nearly a legal adult.

Your sister obviously needs help and therapy, and you can help her get that. Talk to her guidance counselor about resources, talk to her general physician about therapists. This is something she can do without having her parents' support and assistance right now.

You said your parents seem to be unable to look at the bigger picture that someone died, but that's all they *can* see right now. Their reactions are completely in line with parents who are trying to stress, quite correctly, to their daughter that she made a deliberate series of harmful actions that had extremely serious consequences. They are absolutely within their rights to punish her for this. The problem isn't that they are punishing her and reacting badly. Punishment is absolutely called for in this situation. The problem is that they are punishing her and reacting badly without also giving her a support system, and your daughter is internalizing everything they say and do and desperately needs to have grief counseling.

It's possible that your parents have no idea what to do in this situation and are just going into crackdown mode. After you talk to her guidance counselor and get therapist recommendations, write them a letter laying out everything as you've laid it out here. List the evidence--weight loss etc--that you've noted that your sister is struggling to cope. Give them options for individual and family therapy sessions, and make a list of suggested ways for them to show your sister that they are still there for her. Offer to do family counseling with them, and offer to help your sister individually. 

Above all, keep the direction of your letter focused on Olivia. Don't make any accusations against your parents or criticise the punishments they're leveling against her. This isn't their fault, and they'll be more inclined to listen to what you're saying if they don't feel like you're defending your sister in any way. Just focus on letting them know that you all need to be doing a lot more to help her right now. 

I'm sorry that this happened. I hope you all get through it together."
"Noticed this, too. ""Well, we're happy where we live and I like raising our daughter where we are, but it was at *Wife's insistence*."" Like, why tell your parents that? You want them to blame her? "

"Don't explain any thing. This just provides her with an opportunity to counter. 

Normally I would say break up in person however this situation screams to me that you should do it over the phone/text. 

""Girlfriend, over the past year I have tried to convey to you my unhappiness in this relationship. There has been no changes or improvement made so I think it is best for the both of us to go our separate ways. Please accept my decision and do not contact me again."" 

Block her number, block her on Facebook, Instagram, etc. Go no contact and do not relent no matter what she says. If you are really worried but have a good relationship with her parents or close friend(s), maybe contact them immediately after letting them know you have broken up and telling them to please keep an eye out for her but you would appreciate if they didn't involve you any further.

"""""But his main takeaway was that the stalker's dick was bigger than his.""""

you went through a traumatic experience, and instead of focusing on you, asking how you felt, how you dealt with it, does it still bother you, how it affects you today, to reassure YOU, his main takeaway from a thing that is entirely, is to make it about himself.

"There are a thousand and one ways of easily spying on someone if you have full access to their house. You're not the paranoid one, he is. 

 It could be a webcamera, it could be the gaming console. The easiest and best method? Flip the fuse for the house's power. See if he calls ""just to check in"" and say something like ""oh it's fine, just a small power outage"". 

Then you can search the house (hopefully) without him knowing. You'll probably find a webcam or a mic somewhere. If he heard your brother on the front porch, it could be near the front of the house, though I bet he has many in different places. 

I would recommend going to the cops honestly. You need to protect yourself, potentially from your husband who is spying on you. "
"Go up the chain of command, now.

Straight to their bosses. Not professional behavior at all and not okay. The fact they were joking/laughing with your roommate is sickening and I would absolutely bring that along with the recording (after checking to see if anything is legible) straight down to the station. Have your sister/any trusted family and friends help with the packing while you do this."
"I will say that as a female, I do find it very weird. BUT I have heard from males that I know that they have jerked off watching porn with their friends and they didn't consider it gay or anything. I think it's odd and I can't imagine laying around masturbating with my friends, but apparently it's a thing. 

I think if it doesn't bother you or interfere with your life and marriage then why not let them keep doing their weird guy thing? I wouldn't bother talking to his friend. I'm sure he's positively mortified."
"She doesn't have a mental disability that would make her unable to understand the ramifications, and thus consent to sex. You didn't do anything wrong."
"It sucks that they don't accept your life choices, but you also aren't entitled to their money. You and your partner are adults. You're not going to have kids. It should be relatively easy for you to support yourselves without the inheritance. Your brother isn't getting the money either; they're willing it to the grandkids and that makes sense because you'd want to leave funds for the next generation. You are ending your generation because you're not having kids. Why do you need the money? Also, your brother can always give you some of the inheritance if he decides to do so if you're really struggling."
"Cut your hair.  Keep some of the clippings.  Use them to form the words ""I'M DUMPING YOU, FUCKNUGGET"" on your kitchen table. Take a picture and text it to him."
"&gt;I feel a bit bad about how shitty her trip was

Dont... she chose to break up with you during a vacation. There are way better ways to handle that. Believe me, I know, I got broken up with during a vacation, one that I even paid for. I dont feel bad in the slightest for anything I may have done to ruin that vacation for her.

Sorry she is living with you still. Just try and avoid her until she moves."
"You don't have to have a conversation with her about anything. Refuse her. 

It's only hard because you care on some level, but keep in mind that she didn't particularly give a flying crap about you. You owe her nothing."

"Your girlfriend needs to get the fuck over it.

My dog was a Valentine's day gift from an ex. But she's **my** dog and means the world to me, which has nothing to do with him. If any guy was uncomfortable with her, he would no longer be in my life.

It's good that your girlfriend was honest about her discomfort. But this is for her to get over, not for you to fix."
The main floor is completely open concept with vaulted ceilings and hardwood floors so EVERYTHING echoes. Each of the incidents were on the main floor so I'm assuming that's where the problem is. I haven't had any suspicions about the bedroom yet...
That's something I'd expect from a 15 year old not a grown woman in all honesty.

"&gt;Should this guy have really been your best man in the first place?

Right, the best man isn't really the problem.  The above question is directed at OP.  

**OP, why in gods name did pick your best man *for your* wedding to be someone who disrespected the entire reason for you needing someone to fill that role?**  A best man isn't there as decoration, he has a role to fill.  "
"She's nuts. Come in, show the texts, leave. "
"How have you not learnt the language of the country you live in for a year?

You need to lay it out for her. Tell her how you feel and decide from her reaction what you need to do next. It's ok to feel isolated. It's ok to feel surplus to requirements. It's not ok to leave your SO feeling that way. "
"&gt; To my surprise, on Monday they were gone. their stuff is still in our room which is a bit annoying, but I've not encountered her friends since Monday.

I'd tell her she's got until Sunday to get it out or you'll do it.  This may be their ""foot in the door"" to come back."
Hahaha oh man it's happening. 
He is freaking out because you weren't wearing pants around his roommate.
"His daughters are 9 and 10 so he's instilling in them really early the importance of appearance and wearing makeup, you know the important things fathers should teach their daughters /s"
"In another thread, he said his parents tried to sue for partial custody. They are not just selfish, they are insane.

Frankly, I'm in awe of his wife's forbearance...if my own parents sued me to try and take my child away from a stable two-parent home, they would be dead to me. Forever."
"This is 100% her problem and an unreasonable one at that. If she has issues with trust then she needs to work through those with a therapist. I can't imagine putting that kind of blame on an animal. Why not get mad at the couch you had with your ex too? Christ. 

Do not get rid of your cat. "
"Yeah, I don't regret doing it. I regret only she found out. It still makes me giggle."
"I am not going to sit here and try to explain the entire dynamics of men vs women within a marriage. But, as a 46 year old woman who has witnessed a few generations of marriage, trading up for a shinier new model does happen. Most of the time, men don't even realize that they are doing it. I think that is the case here. I will not attempt to defend how women are perceived as ""letting ourselves go"" because it does happen to some women. Why it happens could be 2000 page case study. But, we end up taking care of everyone else and sometimes neglect ourselves. It's not a good thing at all, but we get overwhelmed. We get sucked into this reality as caretaker. Instead of trying fix the marriage, help their wives to get out of that 100% caretaker role, men bail out of the relationship. They choose someone carefree, typically without a lot of responsibilities outside of a career. Usually, that woman IS younger, has not had children, and her body reflects it. So, once again, I am not defending either side...just giving my perspective. I have seen this so many times. Friends of my parents, friends of my much older sister, and now my generation. Hell, my great grandfather went to the store and never came home. He had a much younger woman on the side. As women, I really don't know what to say. Don't be the caretaker? Don't lose yourself? Be cynical and expect to be traded in at some point? My parents have been married for 56 years. It has been chock full of ups and downs, but they knew they could rely on each other. So, OP, from where I sit, from your description of your marriage, you DID trade her in for a new model. But, as you say, EVERYONE is happy, except your ex wife. Then why worry? If only your ex is unhappy, why are stressing about appearances? Have people at work changed their attitudes toward you? Talk with a lawyer. If your ex has crossed some legal line, then take her to court. But sometimes it's just easier to ignore and not kick a hornets nest. She wants you to look like an ahole and by taking her to court will add fuel to her fire. Sorry to drag on, but this seems to be a common theme around here. "
"&gt; In the course of a month, she reached out to him 6 different times by email. He never replied to a single one of her emails. Not even a ""thanks so much for considering me"" type thing. He told me he didn't respond to her because he didn't have to. And that he checked them out on Glassdoor and the reviews say it is a bad place to work and that they pay below market rates, so it would be a waste of his time.

...you can't be fucking serious. This is too predictable. It's TOO predictable. 

I'm so sorry, you married a brat. He can't bring himself to respect a female superior enough to SAVE YOUR HOUSE. He ignored a sure fucking thing because it just wasn't up to his princely standards. God*damnit* OP. This guy is dead weight dragging down your whole life. You know in your heart that this isn't sustainable."
"He needs professional help. This isn't something you can fix.

Meanwhile, his obsession is having a negative impact on your life. You absolutely shouldn't be with someone who keeps saying things like ""you are what you eat"" and ""you eat disgusting trash."" Even though you sound very stable and balanced, that sort of thing will take a cumulative toll on your mental health and self-esteem. Tell him on no uncertain terms that he's not to talk negatively about what you eat. Or you're out.

Seriously, life is so much more fun with someone who knows the value of an occasional pizza or a delicious bowl of ice cream."
"So he's six years older than you, but you're in the same place in your career, you score the same in your exams, and one of you has an ounce of social grace (hint: it's not him. Backpacking through Asia stories are rarely interesting to anyone but the teller.)

What's happening here is that you're reinforcing his delusion that he's the smartest person in the room at any given time. The fact remains that he doesn't respect you, he doesn't value what you bring to the table, and he actually told you, straight to your face, that he thinks he's *better* than you. Not even just smarter, *better*. 

You need to do two things. Stop reinforcing his beliefs, and build up your own self esteem. You're smart. You're in medschool. You get great results. You party for years and still pull off a fantastic MCAT score. Why aren't you believing what the facts are telling you? You're letting him create a narrative of himself as the wise older man, and yourself as some sort of naive bimbo who giggled herself into solid achievement. He doesn't make your life better - as far as I can see from this post, he makes it worse by tearing you down.

Since this relationship replicates your parents, I'd personally focus on medschool and finding someone who treats you with respect, as an equal, who lets you know you're valued and worthwhile and who can accept you doing the same for him. This one isn't worth the effort of rolling your eyes at."
"&gt;I want to say to her, ""Mom, inviting me to your seances and star parties are exactly like a christian mom inviting her daughter to prayer groups and bible studies. It makes it challenging for me to come to you with my problems, because I know my problems will not be addressed, and in stead you will try to help me through prayer."" I know that would NOT go over well with mom though, she thinks of herself as the opposite of an overbearing christian mother. How to I get her to recognize her hypocrisy?


You need to say exactly that.  You've tried gentle hinting.  It's time to drop the truth bomb.  

That said, you should also tell her this:

&gt;I just want my mom to be there for me, without her ""sisters.""

Let her know that you want her support, but not if it comes with another attempt to railroad you into her coven/religion.

"
"Okay, time to warn Mom that if she doesn't do something about this, then you're going to.

Personally, I'd involve CPS if I knew this was happening under my roof.  Your sister sounds like a classic sociopath and she gets her rocks off by abusing your brother, and you *have* the power to stop this.

Your brother is going through one of the most emotionally difficult parts of his life right now, and the abuse your sister is inflicting could damage him for a lifetime, especially his view on women.

If Mom doesn't stop it, then police and CPS action is required, right now."

In your shoes I would just find someone else to work with. Buying a condo is a big decision and you need to work with someone you can trust. Sounds like she just wants an easy commission. 
"Eh, I've been vegan for a long time.  Animal agriculture and the other forms of animal exploitation that I have taken a stand against are exactly the same as when I started - worse, even.  I haven't made a difference in the world.  My partner being vegan wouldn't make a difference in the world. But, living according to principles I believe in, such as nonviolence, makes ALL the difference when it comes to my own peace of mind.  So, that is why I choose to focus on my own soap and not other people's choices.


Plus, in my own experience, someone who goes vegan is just as likely to be a bitter vegan-hater in a year as they are to be a happy healthy vegan.  It isn't a condition I would base a relationship on.

"
"Are you serious??? HE'S the one eating the food, let him make his own choice (which he has). He, like your daughter, has decided he wants to eat meat. There is nothing wrong with that.

Your wife may not agree with it, but he has made a choice. He has never asked to eat meat at home, so I don't really see the problem."
"You are right to be very alarmed. I think that particular Amazon situation is over but it just highlights an ongoing problem: Sarah is an enabler. Enablers are very sweet, caring people that smother people into the ground with good intentions. They can also eventually drag other parties (you) down with them while valiantly trying to ""save"" someone. All Sarah is doing is financially praising and encouraging her mother's irresponsibility.

She very calmly paid a $700 bill without showing any shock or alarm. As Sarah has kept her finances separate, you really have no idea how much money she has been giving her mother this whole time. This is a huge red flag. People with no sense of financial responsibility like her mother don’t get more frugal. What generally happens is they spend more and more until they quickly reach their (meaning your) financial breaking point, then complain how unjust it is to them that they can’t have more!

Your mother-in-law will live DECADES like this. And you are right, if she is this clueless and entitled now, she is definitely going to expect you to foot the bill for any living, medical and assisted living costs (did you know average assisted living is $42,000/year?) that come up in the future. In fact she will feel MORE entitled to your money once you marry her daughter as it now belongs to the “family”.

You seriously need to sit down with Sarah and write out clear and solid rules on financial goals and limits that you both agree to. This isn’t just about her mother. Include saving goals, emergency fund amounts, how much “fun” money to have (her mother’s money would come out of this as she is NOT a necessity), basically just get on a budget together. Sarah's mother needs to have financial goals herself. She has to get a job to support herself and start saving for her own retirement. Once Sarah understands she's actually harming her mother she will be open to change. Has Sarah thought about what happens to the cash flow once it gets redirected to children and a mortgage? Her mother will suddenly be without money. What do you think she will do, wake up and be responsible overnight or go for the easy solution of trying to move in with you?

Once you hash this out, it will make things very clear. Either you and Sarah stand united and limit the funds going to the mother and stick to it, or Sarah wants to keep enabling her to the detriment of all three of you and you need to leave. Financial problems like this are deal breakers.

"Maybe it's just me, but it seems like your brother was trying to do something sweet and help build up your confidence in talking to people.  "
he is also the kind of guy that likes to send girls dick picks to girls he wants to date.
"the first commenter is right. Ask your parents to take you to therapy. This isn't something they can just lay on you and expect you to be okay with. The same with this other kid that they will now be taking care of. Neither of you deserved to be told in this way. 

Possibly sit them down and say, "" Parents, I'm pretty hurt that I was told about my brother only after fifteen years. And only after something so awful has happened. You did both he and I a great disservice by being dishonest and I think that when he gets here we should both start seeing a therapist to get past this. Possibly as a family but certainly individually. We will all need time to process. Please respect that and don't try to force things to work a certain way or for me to feel a certain way about this.""

Try not to sound angry. Calm and collected. Put some real effort into speaking to a therapist it can be helpful. And try to remember that this brother is likely is a similar position as you except he has also lost his mother and hasn't had your dad there to be a father figure. He may be incredibly angry to be the odd man out. I'm not saying you have to be best friends now but you both can possibly find comfort in knowing you're both going through this difficult time together. "
"Stop trying to validate, understand or excuse your sisters actions here.  
What she has proposed is, frankly, fucking deplorable.  
She's deplorable.  
Please stop defending her and remove her from your life completely.  
She's already picked the family she wants in her life, and you guys aren't it.  
All 3 of you deserve better than this shit.  
I actually cannot believe this, I'm fuming.  
"
"Aww man, that sucks. It indeed doesn't sound like she's sorry over anything else besides the fact she got caught. I hope she'll get the therapy she needs one day.

Btw, since your mom supposedly gets $1 000 every month for her personal use, couldn't your dad just reimburse you from that? Not that it would stop her from stealing credit cards, but it would still be some kind of a consequence for her. "
"So you don't want to hear this, but you have to stop trying to warn your sister. It is not working. 

What you can do is change your tactics. I have always found that acting like nothing they do bothers you usually helps. It also makes them likely to freak out.

I would suggest you sit down and talk to your sister, but don't make it about Garrett. I would say something like: 

""I want to apologize if I made your relationship with Garrett hard. I guess I was looking at it from my own perspective. The relationship didn't end well and I guess I didn't want you to get hurt. But seeing how grown up you have gotten and how serious you are, I want you to know I am proud of the woman you have become. I hope there is no bad blood between us."" 

Then you let Garrett weasel his way into a corner. Eventually he will do something skivvy and you won't look like you encouraged it. When he makes a joke like that, you can answer in ways that make him furious, but make you look good. 

- ""Garrett, you really have become like a sibling to me."" 
- ""I totally see why [Sister] is with you. That is totally her sense of humor."" 
- ""Thank god we never had sex Garrett."" "
"Good for you for sticking up for yourself. 

&gt;“I think I would remember if I got lucky enough to nearly have sex with you haha” 

That's such a creepy response when it was obviously unwanted contact. That isn't *sex*, it's *rape.* Gross. Hope everything works out well for you! "
It's your place. I would recommend only letting her come when it is convenient for you and only if you are present.
"I just want to boost this higher, and maybe add more perspective to it. 

The postpartum period is fucking *difficult.* Yes, SIL is acting like a fucking lunatic. That's because when you are post-partum, *you are a fucking lunatic*. There are some very funny responses that people are suggesting here about having the kid and dog share a Jasper/Jasper play date, outfits, middle names etc. But I can promise you that if I had had someone propose something like that when I was in the trenches of infant-hood, I would have been incredibly pissed at them. And I would probably honestly have had a hard time coming from it -- both in forgiving them for fucking around with me when I was so tired and freaked out, but also for just giving me a hard time when they should have cut me some slack because, you know, ""just had a baby"" or whatever. 

OP, you don't do anything. You let it cool over. The post-partum period fades, the hormones cool down. Please do not fuck with a recently-pregnant, recently-gave-birth lady. They are in a weird and fucked up place, and it's easy to get into their heads and do damage. "
you've only been together eight months. you don't have to get married just because you're pregnant. this situation didn't forecast great things. i'd hold off on vows. 
"I know people usually suggest taking the high road, but sometimes pettiness is awesome and cathartic.  I'm nearly 10 years older than op and I'd put this all over Facebook. Fuck that guy and fuck Kayla. "
"He may be gaslighting you, he may not. We'll never know. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't say something. I'd let him know how reprehensible his behaviour was. That it was sexual assault and that if he ever pulls a stunt like that again, you'll be filing charges with the police. His reaction will tell you a lot about what he remembers and what kind of a person he is. But don't just let him walk away scot-free. He may be a rapist that has a history of doing this. 

As for the guy you're dating, yes you should tell him. If he's a caring gent he will support you. If he's a dick and accuses you of cheating, it's better you know now. He shouldn't shame you for this event. It was out of your hands. 

"
"&gt; I knew from past conversations when other people got engaged that my girlfriend said she never wanted a ring but I decided to get one for her anyone because she deserves a beautiful ring and I wanted everyone to know that she did.

&gt; he wouldn't give me permission because he said it's not his decision to make and that I should ask her. He didn't understand how important it was for me to do this. I even spoke to her brothers [27M] and [26M] about trying to get help with her dad but they agreed with him also.

&gt; I tried explaining that I know she is independent from him and she isn’t property or anything like that but it was still an important thing for me to do.

&gt;  I don’t understand why she is upset.

Oh goodness. OP, look at this. 

- You knew your girlfriend didn't want a ring, and you got her a ring, because you wanted to show off to other people.
- Your girlfriend's father told you that you shouldn't be asking him, and you went to his sons to try to get them to pressure him into agreeing with you.
- When your girlfriend found out and was upset, you told her that she should just agree with your take on things.

Of course she's upset! You've had multiple chances to respect her feelings, and every single time you've decided that your attachment to tradition is more important than her views on things. Buying a ring when she didn't want one was a bad idea. Asking her father for permission was an honest mistake, but as soon as he said it was a bad idea, you should have LISTENED, not doubled down. And then tripled down.

Throughout this story, you hear people say ""Don't do X, I don't like it,"" and your response is ""But I will do X anyway, because I think you should like it."" And you don't even seem to see that's what you're doing, or understand why people would be upset about it. I'm not sure there's any way to fix this, unless you can pass on an abject and SINCERE apology that lays out your understanding of how badly you handled all of this.

You want to marry this woman, right? Not some theoretical abstract woman who loves traditional things, but THIS woman? Then you have to start listening to what she actually wants."
Your bf may indeed be the biggest dick you have seen.
"&gt;My husband told me that he thinks we're making a mistake by having this baby
He says that he never should have suggested we deviate from our original plan
He thinks that we're too young to have kids now and that it will ruin our lifestyle
He begged me to consider aborting our baby and going back to our original plan of waiting 2 more years


I share your concerns....since when did 28 and 27 become too young to have children? 

Will 30 and 29 magically be 'old enough', or when those two years pass, will he still be worried about a child ruining your lifestyle?

I think you two need to sit down with a professional (therapist, family counselor) and he needs to really think about what the issues are."
"Kids or no kids? 

Why are you marrying her? Are you ok having a relationship like this for the rest of your life?"
"Your parents are so far out of line it's absurd. You need to be on your wife's side. She didn't ""steal"" you from anyone. She needed to be close to her mother due to her mother's illness and you chose to go with her and raise your family there. Moving halfway would have made zero sense. Then you would just be far from both families. 

Spanking is not an effective form of punishment and CAN in fact cause long term damage. Children who are spanked are more likely to be aggressive. And at best it's hypocritical and teaching your children that people who are bigger and stronger than them have the right to hit them.  

Your parents are so desperate to strike your child that they're harassing you about it and trying to denigrate your poor wife. Your family relationship is very unhealthy and it's sad to me that you can't see that. Your wife is mothering her child and she shouldn't have to compromise with your family members about a fundamental, potentially damaging, aspect of parenting. 

Your family is doing this to themselves. I have zero sympathy for them. Don't let them berate you. Tell them that you know it works for them, but you've chosen not to raise your child that way and they need to respect that. Then shut it down. Tell them the discussion is closed. Hang up or walk away if they persist. Do this until they get the message."
"Personally, I wouldn't stay with someone who needs that kind of validation from others.

She clearly has no respect for you."
"you've never had sex with her in ten years? if that is true it is different than not having sex anymore.

 it doesn't even seem that you like or respect her at all.

 get a divorce so you both can be happy."
"Your wife can't really be surprised that your children would want to test out a different lifestyle. This is what growing humans do. They have to go out and figure things out for themselves. If she wants them to be vegan or vegetarian adults in the long run, the best thing she can do now is let them make their own decisions. Otherwise they're going to end up resenting both of you and eating McDonald's every day. Also, 14 years old is plenty old enough to be making his own dietary decisions. Grounding him for this would be the worst thing in the world you could do."
"Call the police. Now. Dont delete anything, don't throw it away. Dont let him know you know until the police have been told."
I think you meant consummated? 
"I'm ""the sister"" in this situation. My brother's college was paid for, mine was not. He would get $1000 each Christmas, I got nothing. He's the younger sibling, but Dad would have him ""babysit"" me. The will is split 70/30 (although I'd be surprised if I get anything).

Your sister *knows*. She's clearly very intelligent and perceptive. She has likely already accepted the reality that your father is sexist. You don't need to protect her, if anything, I bet she'd appreciate your honesty. You are stepping up and intending to make this a fair split. I think that's fantastic.

Given what I know about my father, I would tell yours that you're ""rethinking"" what you'll do with the money, maybe even ask him what he would do. Then make your split a secret. If he knows your plans are set, it may be a long time before you see any money."

"Have him talk to his estates and trusts attorney about setting up a bypass trust situation with your step mom.  Even though your stepmom would ""never do something"" like write you out of the will, the attorney can make sure that your assets are protected (because guess what?  Almost all contested estates are between stepparents and stepkids!  Shocker!).  What is more is what happens if your dad dies and your stepmom remarries??  If she dies first, EVERYTHING OF YOUR FATHERS GOES TO THE NEW HUSBAND INSTEAD OF YOU.  Your dad can have the estate written so your percentage of assets cannot be touched even though your stepmom can still live off the income.  Lots of things to discuss with an attorney.

I agree with the poster that suggested you taking this to legal advice, because it doesn't sound like this man will ever change and your brother really needs a whole lot of you in his life. In the meantime, try to get your brother out of his reach for as much and as long as possible.


But please, OP, make sure to tell your dad exactly how horrible he is. He fails at being a father, in the worst way."

"That is a really crappy situation that you were put in by your office; especially for them delivering the news so quickly and not waiting until the weekend.  That tells me (along with how you felt about the interview itself) that your managers probably had in mind that the position was going to be filled by somebody else before you even were able to interview.  Like you said, you've known them for years and they should have a good idea about you by now. I'm very sorry that this happened.

Do you know how long you will continue to work there from this point?  As hard as it is, I think the best option for tomorrow is to just put on your best acting face and if anybody asks about the interview to say you don't know anything yet. At least that would probably help you avoid the most awkward conversations.  If you want to just call in sick tomorrow and not have to deal with any of that, I would totally not blame you. "

If she wants to wear the dress, she needs to get the bride to okay it. However, even if she does get the okay, she needs to think long and hard about whether she should wear this dress. Even if the bride said it was okay, most people at the wedding won't know that and will likely think that Becca is trying to upstage the bride. Especially if this is a pricey gown that looks like it could be a wedding dress. 

There are tutorials online that can help with sewing fringe trim on the bottom of a glittery gown to make it look like a flapper dress. It won't be as pretty, but it will keep the peace. See also if Becca can sell the dress online so that she can recoup some of the money. 

Last, Becca needs to grow up. Not wearing white or cream to a weddings is pretty much Rule #1 of Wedding Etiquette unless the invitation itself tells people to wear white/cream. I get the sense that because the other girls and Becca don't really get along, any kind of disagreement between Becca and the other women is automatically taken as ""everyone is being mean to me."" Even when I was Becca's age, I found that attitude really annoying. "
Yeah something else is going on for him to lash out over that. What do you think he meant by he thinks he has to always do everything? The fact that he told you to leave is shitty at most. I don't think you're being crazy I think he's the one acting crazy with that attitude.

"Omg, this is hilarious too. Relationships is on a roll today.

Seriously though, step 1, if she won't listen to your reasoning and doesn't trust you, that's a red flag in my opinion. But if you're set on saving this, ask two or more friends to explain to her directly. Just one and she may think he's your partner covering for you. If THAT doesn't work, let her go.

Red flag number 2, homophobic slurs. Maybe take it as her showing her true colors and let this one go?"

"&gt;Steve's mom has made many comments over the years that amount to her feeling that me remaining single for so long is evidence that I'm a good mom and that I loved her son.

Those comments also reveal that she is quite aware that it's been a long time.  It seems likely that she actually intended the implication to be that you've already waited long enough.  

Unless you've misrepresented Steve's family in this post, I don't think you have anything to worry about.  It sounds like they really love you as a daughter, and they will be glad to learn that you've found some happiness again.  I'm sure it will be hard for them, and they'll feel a little sad about it, but if they're decent people, they'll understand."

I think you need to change this sentence:

To:
It scares me when she says stuff like that because I’m afraid I’ll lose her and I don't really have anyone else.

It's weird, you're doing this thing where you're saying you're worried for her sake, yet it comes across like you're scared to lose her for your sake. A healthy relationship shouldn't be controlled by being worried that if you don't do what someone wants (AKA do everything they ask) that they will stop talking to you or cut you out of their life. As in: you should be able to say no to reasonable things without fear of losing your mother. 

In which case, if that is the situation, you need to realise how unhealthy and manipulative it is. "

'break up the family'...its as though your wife had no family of her own. "
"My grandmother had dementia, and we went through the same thing. Except she wasn't asking about my grandfather (who was alive and kicking), she kept asking about her *parents*. She reverted back to her childhood memories and would ask me where her mom was, who was going to take her to school, who was going to feed her dinner, who was going to take care of her, etc., etc.  
  
The first few times I told her they had died, many many year ago, and she was there with them and went to the funeral. But that she was ok because she's a grown up, and has a husband, and raised 6 kids, that I was my mom's daughter, and had **lots** of people to take care of her. That worked for awhile. She would get upset about learning that her parents had died, but reminding her of her husband and kids and who I was seemed to sort of trigger her memories and she would calm down pretty quickly.  
  
As things progressed, those memories couldn't be triggered any more. She thought I was a nurse, and it got easier to go along with it than to convince her otherwise. Even when I told her her parents had died, she'd just ask again within the hour, because she had genuinely forgotten I had told her they died. So I started lying. ""Dad is at work and mom had to go out to run errands, but it's ok because I'm here to watch you for awhile, and they'll be back later! Let's go get our hair done/go to lunch/go to church, doesn't that sound like fun!?""   
  
I lied through my teeth for the last 7 months of her life. And honestly, as much as it kind of fucked me up, she didn't even know. I played the role of whoever she thought I was on any given day; nurse who was way too young to be a nurse, babysitter, one of her sisters, one of her daughters, one of my cousins...I answered to whatever name she called me, made up stories and memories of things I'd never done. It gave her comfort, and that was all that mattered to me."
"What stands out to me is that you had to go digging for all this, you know? Its not like he came clean and tearfully confessed and whatnot, you had to find this all yourself. Stay strong OP and be kind to yourself."

"I wouldn't let his parents dictate your wedding. Your SO sounds like he's in this with you and if you want to move it up, move it. 

Maybe ask why they want so badly to wait two years? Are they wanting to help out financially and feel that two years is long enough that they'd have something saved for you both as a gift?

If it's not anything like that, I would move forward with your plan. . You've already explained to them that your fathers illness, while not presumed Terminal, it could be at any point. Explain that You would appreciate the sentiment of having *everyone* present on your big day and hoped they would understand and support you both in this decision as SO is on board with the plan to move forward. You understand their disappointment in not waiting two years but plans change and circumstances change. "
"Call the police. They are able to check for hidden cameras, and other devices that are used to spy on people. 

Listen, this is your husband, and I get that you love him. But if he really is spying on you while he is gone, it is beyond sick and disgusting. And it is also illegal.

If spying equipment is found, you do not need to press charges. But The fact that you **can** press charges, should scare the shit out of him. if you find stuff, and still want to stay with him, I would go to marriage counseling.

Also there is the fact, that allot of people that suspect their SO of cheating, are projecting, and usually they are the ones either being physically or emotionally cheating.

(He was checking on you while he was at his mothers for Christ's sake)

EDIT: I would also be suspicious of him putting a key logger on your computer as well. So if you are posting this from home, or your phone I would be careful."
"&gt; When we got married she wouldn't let my mom get ready with her and the bridesmaids, even though her mom was there. When she gave birth to our daughter, she wouldn't let my mom be in the delivery room, even though her mom got to be there. 

You realize both of those are normal, right? Especially the delivery room?

&gt; they had a lot of plans for me.

&gt; They are raising my niece and nephew half the time, so they expected to have my daughter half the time too

Wow.

&gt; After she was born they actually hired a lawyer and tried to sue us for partial custody of her. 

Do you not see how messed up that is? Your parents are insanely controlling. 

&gt; So not being able to have ANY say over how my daughter's being raised is a major issue for them.

Grandparents aren't supposed to have any say about how their grandchildren are raised! They get to respectfully offer advice and respectfully make suggestions. That's it. 

And grandparents who try to sue for partial custody of their grandchildren get nothing. I'm surprised you take your child to visit these people at all. "
"Not only did he have her spend the night despite your condition, he let her stay there alone while he was at work. That's messed up. "
"Yep. As she gets older, she's going to start fighting you when you decide to visit their house because people there hit her. "
"&gt;I've got no friends, no prospects, no lady friend, no nothing. It sucks.

Let's try and spin this into a positive: you have never been more free than you are right now. You can go anywhere, become anyone, do anything, and try everything. You have nothing holding you back.

There are lots of practical aspects of your life that you'll have to sort out of course, but try to look at this as a beginning rather than an ending. Good luck, OP."
Or he could write 'since the wedding is off I recommend donating the money to (insert charity).' 
"This is good news. Hopefully your mum has realized how awfully abusive she was being, given the state she seems to be in.

"Just a heads up, down in the comments she mentioned that her husband works in IT."
"I would start out by contacting your local Alzheimer's Association and Area Agency on Aging, both have vouchers for respite care so in the short term, that could assist with either having help in the home or putting your MIL in adult day care. Also at the AAA, you can ask to speak to Information, Referrals, and Assistance and the Family Caregiver Advocate. Both should be able to give you ideas of good long term care in your area. 


It sounds like your husband needs some education about Alzheimer's. While some dementias can get better (like if they're from a UTI), Alzheimer's is degenerative. She might have good days but overall she will go downhill. Frame the problem not like she's a nuisance, but like you are not capable/qualified to perform the care she needs. 


You could also start the process of finding a placement on your own. Your husband may have a negative view of nursing homes, but there are some really nice ones! He may also be concerned about finances, because if it's not medically necessary the bills will add up. 


You can always ask to speak to a staff member at these homes, and have a social worker or head nurse do an assessment to see if your MIL is appropriate. There are different levels to assisted living, so you definitely want to make sure you're looking at the right places. 



Tldr, contact staff/social workers at local Area Agency on Aging, Alzheimer's Association, and senior centers for help"
"You can support your daughter by saying that you don't agree with her choice, but you won't make waves about it, and telling her if it does work out you'll be happy for her, and if it doesn't she can always come back to you.

And I think you can tell her that whilst her results are disappointing, she's never going to be a disappointment to you. You should also ask her to do whatever she can to improve her education and skills, because she is 100% reliant on her partner and if he left her or died right now then she would be left with no prospects whatever. Being a SAHM is fine, but you should do everything possible to improve yourself in case it doesn't work out.

&gt;  She's been crying since she found out and refuses to finish high school.

&gt; She or fired from her first job last week after working there a month.

&gt;  She also doesn't know how to drive.

These are more serious problems than the age of the guy she's dating. You should be concentrating on solving these problems. If she can solve these, then one possibility is that her self-esteem rises and she decides she doesn't want to be a SAHM any more. But don't get your hopes up on this.

tl;dr; don't be opposed to her relationship, do encourage her to develop.

"You know how you're feeling right now about not being in the mood for sex even though the two of you had a big sexual plan?  It sounds like that's how your wife often feels.

The thjng that stuck out to me is that you two had a talk about your sex life where you both had some dissatisfaction or concerns (you about her not initiating, her about needing more to get in the mood) but the end result seems to have only been to address the issue you had, and to do so by putting the whole burden of fixing it on her.  Did you also come up with a plan for you to help her get in the mood more?  

Your wife is telling you why she's having trouble initiating.  The way to fix that isn't to just insist she initiate anyway and figure it out herself (nor does an anniversary plan that's explictly ""entire day we're expected to just have sex"" sound like something that will take the pressure off and help her enjoy it).  You've got to also work--both of you--on the thing she's struggling with (getting in the mood)."

"I have been in poly relationships before, so please don't think I'm slamming your relationship model. But there are a couple things you said that stuck out to me. The first is what you didn't say, and that's any ground rules for your relationships. A common rule is that a primary partner has veto power over partners. 

You say you believe every relationship is worth exploring to the fullest. . .but that's not true. In poly or monogamous relationships sometimes you date someone who is a bad person or just bad for you and the relationship needs to end, not dragged out forever. Your husband should have ended things the instant it became clear she expected him to leave you. Staying with her was incredibly disrespectful to you and damaging to your relationship. 

He should put you first. He spoiled your rare time together and romantic vacation because of his actions with this woman. Not okay. You seem to give so many of his actions passes because you don't want to say anything about his relationships with other women. Poly still has rules! You are still his primary partner and you should come first!

Then he puts you at risk at minimum financially by (possibly-I doubt she was actually pregnant) impregnating this woman? And he still talks to her? I'm sorry, but that is not okay. You need to stand up for yourself and realize how messed up this and your husbands priorities are.

"Alright I'm probably going to get downvoted into oblivion for this but I have experienced first-hand the damage high school girls can do, and I urge you to make a safe conversation and ask your girlfriend why she doesn't want you to follow this girl. It could go much deeper than you know.

When I was in high school, a girl I had never spoken to before decided to ruin my life. Something about her boyfriend saying I was pretty, I still don't really know, but she wanted to destroy me. She told her friends she wouldn't be satisfied until I killed myself. She sabotaged every relationship I had in creative ways that made her look like some martyr who was just trying to protect everyone from the evil person I apparently was. I had one friend, nobody would date me, people called me at all hours of the night just to call me a slut or tell me to kill myself and then hang up. I was afraid to go to the authorities because she had so many people on her side that I knew it would only make it worse. This started five years ago, we're in our twenties now, and she still tries to sabotage me. I asked my fiance to block her from social media (they were acquaintances) and he begrudged me until I told him that story, which was really hard for me to do, but he's completely on my side now.

Please, OP, before you call her crazy or controlling, talk to your girlfriend. Tell her you just want to know more about the situation with this person. Teenage girls can be downright evil, and the damage they cause can last a long time. I know that whenever I see that girl anywhere, even in an Instagram comment, it's like she's still terrorizing me. Just make sure you have all the information before you make a call."

If Rachel chooses to follow their request, that's her choice. She'll have the consequence of losing her mom and sisters, because choices have consequences. The hilarious part is that, if her future in-laws are really this insane, they'll never really get over her being a child on an unwed teen mom. She'll never be good enough for them.

"Oh my god what a fucking asshole. Fuck taking the high road - fucking destroy the dickhead OP. RUIN HIM. Make sure everyone knows what a complete piece of shit he is. I'm so so so sorry he turned out to be this person, you really didnt deserve this - take solace in the fact that you are a better human being then either of them. Move on and never look back he showed who he is. Hugs to you."
"""Hey, look, I know this might be embarrassing to hear, but when you have your conversations with your boyfriend at night X and I can hear every word."" With any luck, she'll move on her own."
"A few things. 

First, any contract that contains unenforceable language or illegal activity is automatically null and void in the eyes of the law. By my reading of your previous post and update, it seems like you were an illegally hired employee (illegal for him, not you), and if the sex was spelled out in the contract, that is also illegal, as you can't barter sex in a contract. I'm also assuming that this was never notarized. 

Second, guys who say things like:

&gt;he knows a lot of people, and while he is a nice man, these people are not nice and they will hurt others if necessary

are as a rule full of shit. It's like when a guy can't get into a club and starts screaming ""Do you know who I am?"" at the bouncer. He's nobody, otherwise he wouldn't have to say it. 

This guy is a bully. He preyed on you because you were weak, no offence, but you were. He likes feeling like he has all this power over you, but he really doesn't. He's trying to hold on to his feeling of control. 

And yes, you can go to the police with his threats. As far as your concerned, he paid you under the table for housework, and then you willingly had sex with him for no compensation. No crime there except failure to disclose taxes, but you can deal with that when filing next year. But if he brings up this contract to the police, you'll be fine, he'll be screwed. "
"NO..just no. This guy is either clueless or just doesn't care about hurting your feelings. Never get implants for some guy. If you ever want to do it for yourself, fine but you should never do it to please others. My ex wife had them done. Before she asked me what I thought. I told her I didn't want to influence her in any way. It was her decision."
"Well, if it were me, then I would track down the boy who punched your son and tell him the truth. And press charges.

Let your son change schools if he wants."
"Tell the brother you miscarried and have the boyfriend/friend take you for a proceedure. If your brother ever tells your parents, lie. 

And don't listen to people who say things like 'keep your legs' together. Try to always use condoms if you are going to have sex."
"It sounds like he may have had good intentions and wanted to help you out of your shell a bit. I think it was a bad idea, but there is a chance his heart was in the right place. 

I think it's too big a deal to pretend you don't know. I would tell him that you know the truth and you don't appreciate the deception, but I would try not to come down too hard on him. "
"If I were him, I would also not care At all. Why? I'm totally winning. I'd be as cool as a cucumber."
"So I have a cat. And I love her to death... I got her when she was about 2 days old (she was abandoned by her mom) and I raised her and bottle fed her and she's literally my baby. 

She's also the cat from hell. 

She hates everyone who isn't me. She bites. She scratches. She hisses. And she especially hates my fiancé, whom I've been living with for almost 2 years. He hates it. He doesn't know why the cat hates him so much. He hates being scratched all the time. I know he would absolutely prefer if she didn't live with us.

One day, she got out. I went into panic mode. But you know what? My fiancé was the first one out the door with a flashlight looking for her. He called her name. He shook the treats. He looked in all the bushes and under all of our neighbors patios. For hours. Because to him it didn't matter that he hated her, it mattered that I loved her. 

I don't think the mistake of leaving the patio door open is worth breaking up over (even though it's so SO annoying that he would), but his reaction would definitely be a deal breaker for me. If you know something is that important to me and you can't even be bothered to care, I would take pause. If I love something that much then my SO should at least respect my feelings for it, brushing them aside as no big deal would not sit well with me. I would personally have done the same thing you did, mainly because I wouldn't feel like my feelings were being respected. If that means I'm overreacting then so be it. I'd rather be with someone who cares than someone who would invalidate my feelings rather than help me. 

And in case anyone cared, my cat eventually popped out of a bush while we were calling her name and we brought her back home. She and my fiancé get along better now, she's stopped hissing and biting and she sometimes walks over to him for a cuddle. 

I'm hoping your cat comes back to you too."
I can't fathom a person reacting that way when you have gone out of your way to help so much. What an entitled asshole.
"On a side note, the wife controlling all income with an allowance to the husband is also a Japanese thing.

Probably something to do with women being in charge of the household.

The supporting parents in old age thing is very much a Chinese /Asian culture thing, so much so that China relaxed the one child policy partially because  it was causing issues with caring for seniors and retirement.

I strongly suspect that what you and your girlfriend have are incompatible cultural mores.  If you can't agree to compromise you'd be better splitting up. Some things are never going to ""work themselves out""."
"First, talk to him when you're both calm and not in a sexual context. ""That was a very distressing experience for me. I would really prefer that you didn't bring it up any further. I've told you how I feel about your penis. I do not want to talk about it ever again in the context of you comparing it to the man I despise with everything I've got. Please, just stop.""

Then, if he ever mentions it again, stop reassuring him. Instead, focus on your feelings. ""I would really prefer it if you stopped reminding me about this very distressing experience."" But my penis! ""Can we please stop talking about the man who stalked and terrified me for a year?"" BUT MY PENIS! ""I was 19 and this man took advantage of me. I really don't want to talk about it any longer."" *But my penis!!!!* ""I live in fear that my coworkers or friends or relatives may come across these photos and then judge me for something that happened to me when I was still a teenager. I would much rather not be reminded about it, if that's ok with you."" This isn't about his penis. Keep reminding him about that.

If that doesn't work, I think a good reaction is to ask ""what would you like me to say to that?"" If he says he needs reassurance, remind him that you've tried reassuring him and it didn't help. So now you don't know what he wants, and you wish he would just tell you so that you could stop repeatedly having the same upsetting conversation. "
"I liked this part:

&gt; He was really laughing it up and making fun of us for looking at that picture.

&gt; Naturally, we got pretty riled up and hatched a plot to get back at him. 

Naturally? "

"For the love of Pete, do NOT let her know how you're overthinking this.  You might want to ask if that was an impulse or just how she feels about you.

If you enjoyed it don't screw it up.  Sounds like she was happy about it.

I mean if she initiated, was intimate, holding your hand, etc. that's a pretty clear sign she's into you.  You done got seduced son.  

If you're lucky you just took the first step down the path from friend to partner.

May very well be she's had feelings for you for a while.

Plus only having one close friend...if she's an introvert that's perfectly normal.  

Introvert doesn't mean shy, it means you don't need or even want a lot of close relationships.  Other people are draining.  You can be friendly, the life of the party, sociable, entertaining, but only so much.

You're perfectly content just being alone or sometimes with a chosen partner.

Extroverts thrive on socialization. Introverts enjoy socialization, but need time away.

"I see a ton of red flags here, but I'm just going to address the issue brought up in the title.

"I don't think your concerns about the medication being a cause are completely unfounded - I went back on Zoloft after a whole off it and had a manic phase for about a week. I was super impulsive, I was making all sorts of plans, everything sounded like a great idea.

has he consulted a doctor at all about restarting his medication? SSRIs are not something to fuck around with lightly (I've learned this the hard way), and going back on a full dose after time off it could possibly explain some of his behaviour."

"I think you were picked to be the odd one out because your boyfriend knows your parents and he's somewhat family so he can sit there, whereas the other dates may not have a table they can join where they would be comfortable? Either way that stinks. If it really bothers you you could always sit at your parent's table and leave the main table. "
"Yup. He's already made the choice to start eating meat outside of the house, and you are totally right about the risk of him resenting you. Vegan diets aren't for everyone (and I say this as a longtime vegan). "
I feel like I'm in the Bizarro World with these comments. 
You don't need to tell her. I don't think it would help anything. 
"OP I am not a lawyer, but you should document everything, date, time, and start communicating with her through your lawyer only. Doing so will protect yourself and your child."
"Okay, I don't have any advice, but ""Anne"" actually posted about this on r/relationships a few weeks ago (no links allowed, or I'd find it and post it). If I'm remembering correctly, she was almost unanimously told that even from her perspective, the then almost-relationship was unhealthy, the gesture was creepy, and she should listen to you (whom she mentioned) when you expressed discomfort. Sounds like she decided against the popular opinion. Honestly, I think your concerns are warranted enough to be worth sharing with your parents. Sneaking around with a independent adult, which is what John should be considered, isn't safe. "
"1. Your parents aren't monsters , they are just mad and rightly so after the CATASTROPHIC series of mistakes your sister made. She broke their trust and despite what some redditors believe being young doesn't excuse you of responsibility especially when you knew better.

2. However you will have to convince them to look past that angry to help your sister back up . Another death would just be a waste."
"This.  If the dress isn't dry clean only, she can use a washer and RIT dye.  I used to dye tan/white/cream jeans for custom horse show clothing this way.  
If not another option would be to eBay the dress she bought and use the funds to buy a dress from a place like TJMaxx or ModCloth.  

You might not like this option but I fucked up like this because I honestly didnt know about the whole only the bride wears white thing as an early 20 something.  My mom and Oma stopped me in time and helped me pick out a cute black cocktail dress to wear instead.  
Maybe you could spot the money and help her out."

"Posting this from a throwaway myself because I expect to get flamed for this and called a spoiled millennial. 

**While technically, no one is entitled to anything from their parents after 18, I think there is a very special place in hell for parents who can afford to help their adult children when they need it, but choose not to. That's your fucking kid in need of a hand and you just turn a blind eye when you can help them? People like that deserve the shittiest possible nursing home in the future imo.

And I just want to say that.

"Also, I do wonder why they feel like they should be favored over the wife's mother, who actually seems to need them to live close due to her health. His parents seem extremely selfish if they expect them to live nearby simply for their own convenience.

"OP, I run an embroidery business, and I deal with a lot of monograming. When guys are getting gifts for their girlfriends/fiancees, they almost always ask about what initials to use, what order, etc. The answer I almost always give is that if you're not married, use her maiden name. Monogrammed gifts are often given as wedding gifts to signify a marriage (combining of the initials), it doesn't make sense to give something like that when you're not even engaged.

ETA: If you want to break up with her, PM me, I'll totally monogram FU onto a bag or something."
Give the girlfriend away.
"Even discounting her treatment of animals, she poured draino and dog food into your computer. She doesn't sound too bright. "
"Oh, OP... I am sorry. I think some of the comments here are missing the greater picture - it's about you feeling rejected as a child and a part of their family, and feeling as though they don't care about your future because you haven't decided to pop out a couple of kids. It's about feeling abandoned.

You can't do much to change their minds, so I would suggest drawing back on your contact with them for now. Whether or not you go no-contact is up to you, however I would advise against it since no doubt it would get around that you did it because of the money and it would come across badly. 

I would take some space and then when you feel up to it, write a letter or speak to your parents and express your hurt. Tell them that you feel as though your relationship with them has been reduced to whether or not you have offspring and that you feel as though they don't value or truly care about you. They have placed all your importance in your uterus. Tell them that your decision to not have children isn't about them and that you never intended to hurt them. 

In the meantime I might suggest focusing on yourself. Perhaps counseling, or just spoil yourself - go to the spa, hike, whatever makes you happy! Your value as a person and a child absolutely is not and should not be wrapped up in the state of your uterus. 

Also, to wrap up... Fuck that bullshit, I'm seriously angry on your behalf. They're your parents, their love and care for you is *not* supposed to be based on whether or not you pop out a baby or two. Remember that. Your parents are showing a very selfish and malicious side in this. "
"So two of you knew that there was supposed to be no lapdances and neither of you tried to stop it?

Edit: and she asked to remove best mans speech and you are not complying with her request again after not complying with her no lapdance rule?   Well that sets the tone for the marriage.  "
The parents may actually have to pay child support to the brother. It's illegal to kick your minor children out.  
"He didn't engage with a promising prospective-job because he doesn't think it sounds like a great place to work when you're about to lose your *house*? Look, I'm all for being selective about who you work for if you have the luxury to do that, but you don't have that luxury when you're about to lose your house.

This guy is never going to be a team with you. Ever. He doesn't know the meaning of the word. You may love him and he may love you, but he isn't marriage material, even though you married him, and he doesn't look like being so for years to come, if ever.

I think you need to walk away and restructure your life around depending on just you. Look seriously at the house as if it were all up to you and weren't about to be foreclosed. What are the consequences of foreclosure for your credit rating, loss of any capital, etc? Should you try to save it to preserve your credit and/or equity? Most importantly, could it pay for itself if you rented it out and went and lived somewhere else? 

If you think it's worth saving and you think there's a way it can be done, go and talk to your bank. Tell them you know they have the right to foreclose, but the main barrier to repayment has been your husband, you're now divorcing him, and you have a plan to get the mortgage back on track. Ask if they would be willing to give you a 1-2 month stay on foreclosure and repayments (with interest continuing to accrue) to get you both moved out, and get tenants in. Look, they might go for it, they might not. It depends on how much they stand to gain or lose. 

If they go for it, get your husband and your belongings out ASAP and get tenants in. I would strongly suggest you just fire sale your furniture for seed money to get you back on your feet. Furniture is a bit of an albatross in a situation like this - it makes you unwilling to take budget/shared accomm that would alleviate the crisis, and makes you look for accommodation that will fit all your stuff. At this point you just need to start again with as little baggage as possible and build up from there IMO."
"I love these people trying to make this okay. Here's the thing: We are all entitled to our deal breakers. If pot is a deal breaker for you, *that's okay.* It's your *career*. 

If you think you need to end it, that is perfectly okay. You need to do what's best for you.

If you want to try to work it out, make him understand what a big deal this is and let him know that it is a deal breaker. If he agrees to not do it again, change the habit for you, and you feel you can trust him, I wish you the  best of luck. 

If he already knew what a big deal it was for your career, and thus knew he was risking your career when he did it, then you already have your answer about how much he cares.

&gt;This was his second chance, last November I found a small amount in our guest bathroom and forbid it from coming back into the house again or I'd have to move

This bothers me the most. If it was anything except pot you'd be getting different answers. You had boundaries, and he intentionally crossed them. Now you either need to accept that he won't respect your boundaries (or at least this particular boundary), or he needs to give you reason to believe that this time he actually will respect you and your career."
"Oh my god.

I feel sick to my stomach reading this. I cannot fathom how violated I would feel if my SO did anything of the kind.

This is not forgivable. I don't know what kind of recourse you have, if any, but for god's sake, woman. Leave this man. See a therapist to properly deal with the breach of trust, and move on with your life.

I am so, so sorry. "
"I would tell her that it's not about keeping score, it's about keeping your word. You need gym shoes and she promised to get them for you. Just like she really looked forward to the song, you looked forward to her showing you love through getting you something you really needed. 

""You asked me to write you a song for a pair of shoes. I thought this was going to be an exchange of presents between us. Just like you listen to the song and think of how much I care for you, I wants to have something I valued from you as well. The fact that you accused me of keeping score when I asked you to keep your word hurts me and our relationship. It makes me feel like I cannot trust you. So, if you don't want to buy me the shoes don't offer to buy me shoes. But I would like you to keep your word."" "
They look like photogenic homeless people using rugs they found in a dumpster for warmth.

"This is an incredibly important question, OP.

I'm 34 and most of my friends didn't get started having kids until closer to 30.  Just know that they love you and wouldn't be doing this if they didn't want to.  You can pay their kindness forward in the future by being an awesome uncle to the children they eventually do have one day.
"Wearing a dress is a bit different than wearing an oversized t shirt, IMO. I am also a petite female who enjoys flounce skirts, leggings, large t shirts, etc, and while I think your boyfriend was wrong to get angry and demanding rather than to have a mature conversation with you, I agree that he has every right to not want you to wear a large shirt and no pants in front of his new roommate. 

Yes, you were accidentally drunk, got pulled out of bed by a friend, etc, and that all makes this happening once completely understandable. That being said, people who like women (I'm a lesbian myself) tend to find the idea of a woman in just a t shirt, not to mention a t shirt and long socks, to be sexy, and he has the right to not be comfortable with you dressing like that in front of his roommate. You also have the right to dress however you want, to tell him ""tough luck"" and keep doing so, or break up. 

It's not really a matter of either of you having a ""wrong"" opinion, but that your two justifiable opinions conflict."
"It might be possible that this is a form of sexsomnia, where he truly is asleep and not aware of what he's doing. If this is the case, he should see a neurologist and get a sleep study done to determine what's going on while he sleeps. If he's not willing to do this, he probably knows exactly what he's doing and just doesn't care how much it affects you, which is awful :( I would sit him down and say you're concerned that he might have a sleep disorder- youll probably be able to gauge by his reaction and openess to looking into it whether he is doing it consciously and just doesn't care how it's affecting you."
"Chelsea is a damn good friend who isn't afraid to tell you the plain hard truth for your own good. 

Your mother is a selfish freeloader. You're a goddamn college student. She shouldn't be asking or guilting you into anything other than to call her weekly. "
"You don't make it work.  She's the one who did wrong, she's the one who needs to make it work.  You probably should start with marriage counseling, but yea you should consult with a divorce lawyer as well because there's a strong probability that it's too late to fix it."
"Thank you for saying this. 

OP, I know that some things she said were rude. But realize that she's been scared of being raped or assaulted for weeks IN HER OWN HOME and *your mother blamed her for it*. She was eventually sexually assaulted and the guy goes away, but the same risk is still there. Your mother doesn't protect or support your sister, and mom is *still* blaming sister for her clothes, as if sis needs to be worried in her own home so she isn't raped. I don't think you understand how traumatic and serious this is for her. She's a victim of sexual assault who asked for help, got none, and also got blamed with ""what was she wearing"". In her own home! The place where she's supposed to be safe!

It seems understandable to me that she would be desperate to get out of that situation. Living is daily fear and not having a safe home is one of the most awful things in the world. "

This new stunt confirms that he's way too eager for you to pick up booze. Why? I'm guessing it's that if you drink, you'll be more of a grown up in his mind, so he'll feel more comfortable making a move on you. In his fantasy land, you receive the vodka and decide it's ""time to grow up,"" invite him over to drink it with you, and...well, you can picture the rest. It's super creepy.

You thought that you might be in real danger, and a crowd of people had gathered around you, all without providing assistance. These are the components that create real trauma within a person.

You need to leave this relationship now. Your girlfriend not only acted so stupidly, but apparently knows a bunch of other ignorant people who are only too willing to humiliate a stranger. You're dating an asshole. It's far better to be alone - trust me. And you don't have to be alone for long. Don't stay with a jerk because you're afraid that you'll never meet someone else.

* OP is feeling guilty that boyfriend broke the bong only after she convinced him to move it.

OP; don't worry about it. Your boyfriend doesn't blame you and doesn't want you to buy him a replacement. Is his birthday coming up though? Or any kind of anniversary? Buy him a new one then and be happy that your boyfriend sounds like a pretty cool guy.

"I would say as little as possible in your response.  Do not admit that you had an abortion or even admit that you were pregnant.  In situations like this, saying as little as possible is best.  

I recommend this:

Todrick,

I am surprised to hear from you after all this time.  We broke up because I wanted out of [Backwards]. We had very different ideas about what we wanted in the future. I have since been able to recognize those dreams and am very happily married now. I wish you the best, but please do not contact me again.

GGG

edited to add:  not responding at all is a fine solution too."
"""Honey, I love you.  I'm thrilled that things are going so well for you right now, and the last thing I want to do is try and stifle your independence.  If you think I'm being controlling, then we need our own counseling to sort this out, or I honestly don't know how we're going to make this work.""

You're a therapist.  I don't need to tell you that keeping this bottled up is not a viable long-term strategy, or that it's not going to go away if you don't address it somehow.  Don't try to diagnose her, but do be clear that you can't continue like this."
"Tell her to be a little more independent.

She can't just hijack your life because she has no home, no visa etc etc. That's not a relationship, that's you helping her out. 

So I'd say number 1. "
"You're fucked. This way of approaching someone doesn't work and totally creeps people out when they're on the receiving end. They didn't know you have all these fantasies about them in your head and they didn't want to find out via this kind of overture

Unless they have a high amount of personal self-confidence in dealing with something like this (to reply and say they have no interest in you like that), they often just don't respond because that's the best you can do in a situation like this and hope it goes away.

&gt; Everywhere I look, everyone I turn to, they say to just drop it, ignore her, and move on but I can't. This was MY CRUSH for the longest time, the one that I really wanted it to work out with but now it's fucked. I can't just go to class feeling like this. I have to fix this somehow. Do I just message her back saying I was drunk and that it was a mistake?

Everyone is correct.  Skip class if you can't handle your emotions.

Don't message her more, don't talk to or stare at her unless she decides to talk to you about it (extremely unlikely), and leave her alone from now on so she doesn't have to drop the class and/or get a restraining order

&gt; Do I message her back with a link to this post? I don't know what else the fuck to do. I'm not this kind of person.

Again: don't message her.  Anything more you do or say will be creepy if she doesn't have an interest and doesn't want to talk to you about it. She almost certainly doesn't."

"She used to say that that fact made her super uncomfortable and that she didn't like that she was named after a crush, or anyone for that fact.

"First things first you should go apologize because you just screamed at someone for cooking your something that you didn't like. You also just totally judged him for his eating habits

**You were really, really mean.** 

&gt;I always associated these kinds of foods with dieting.

Get rid of this idea of dieting. Dieting is a short term change that results in short term weightloss. Dieting isn't how healthy people stay healthy. Health is a lifestyle. Your bf understands this intuitively.

This *is* normal food. Even without grains, stir fry is far from some extremist paleo-vegan-fruitarian meal plan. He's making tasty, inexpensive, easy to cook, basic foods. 
 
&gt;How can I stop being upset about this? I know I really shouldn't be...

Get over your insecurities. This either means recognizing that he finds you attractive, or getting yourself to a point at which your happy with your body. 

You don't have to change your diet. Want to eat the kinds of food you normally eat? Cook them. Feel like your portion is too small? Ask for more. He obviously finds you attractive and sees nothing wrong with how you look. 

he hasn't done anything wrong.

"This sounds like an (im)perfect storm of coping mechanisms. 

Your grieving dad is trying to find a substitute for your deceased mom. It sometimes happens where the father and daughter kind of create a husband/wife dynamic (without the sex) where the daughter starts filling the role that the wife used to fill in terms of chores and social interaction.

Mila is finding comfort in a man who treats her better than her family does. You could summarize it as daddy issues, though it's a little more nuanced than that.

I fear they found each other thanks to this and you're right in the middle. It sucks, but you should probably talk to your dad about it."
"All this in 6 months?  This is ridiculous.

"People here are taking their cue from OP.  She clearly indicates that she doesn't think it's cheating or hurting anybody.  As long as she doesn't think it's cheating, it doesn't really matter what you or I think.  The secrecy is a potential issue, and it is being discussed."
"There's a strong vibe in your post that you are beginning to see your wife as the issue here, because your family/friends outnumber her. It would just be easier to cave to your family because she's only one person and ""it won't scar my child for life"". So I'm just going to state a few facts and you can do with them what you will.

1. Being spanked didn't stop a single one of these people from growing up to be extremely manipulative when not allowed to do as they please with someone else's child. These people are all throwing a tantrum and you are tolerating it. You are actually entertaining this bullshit. Let me spell this out: you yourself are too big to be physically abused, so your family has resorted to emotionally abusing you to try and get their way. 

2. Being spanked did not teach these people that other points of view exist, and they should be listened to, considered, and tried out before they are completely written off. Especially in regards to someone else's child.

3. Apparently being spanked DID teach these people that everyone who doesn't do it is insane and judging them, even when there is no evidence to support that fact. The mental gymnastics on their part are impressive. You should be insulted. 

Being spanked does work in many cases as an extremely quick solution to disciplinary issues (I'm admitting that as someone who was spanked as a child and does not spank their own children). But the other side of the issue here is the fact that you've apparently got at least half a dozen people who refuse to consider a single alternative to it? Not even one because heaven forbid we all keep our hands to ourselves right?

"I saw the title for this and was thinking about it as I went to make breakfast. I thought this was a pretty disgraceful way to behave and that you should take away his key, give it to Olivia and also give her some of his stuff.

Then I came back, read your post and saw:

1) OLVIA'S PARENTS DIED
2) He deliberately timed it to ruin her interview
3) he then had the arrogance to abuse her over it

WOW! What a piece of shit.

Firstly if you are paying any of his bills or giving him any money, stop right now.

You guys screwed him up with crappy parenting and now he's an asshole. He's not a kid so it's really too late to fix him. It's gone way beyond just a stern talking toy. You need to point out what he did wrong, how terribly he behaved, how disappointed you are and he here's not welcome at your house. Move out all his stuff and drop it off at his mum's or GF's. Don't let him back in until Olivia is gone and if she visits in the future, BAN HIM UNTIL SHE IS GONE AGAIN.

I also think this thread is full of great advice: He may try to hurt Olivia again so protect her, you put your life on hold for him so stop doing that, he is very manipulative of you so don't let him do that or worm out of punishment, he is an adult and needs to figure out what he did was wrong himself and apologise.

You should also make a big apology to Olivia for this."
My father is very sane and will flip out when he hears about this. I'm pretty sure she knows this and is trying to get me to sign the papers before my dad wakes up and then try to spin it and make it look like it was my choice so he could be on her side. I'm just afraid of what will happen when she doesn't get her way.
"For one, I would invest in some outdoor cameras to keep and eye on your property at night and when you're not at home. That's creepy as hell. Have you tried talking to your other neighbors about your other neighbor's behavior?

"&gt;there is something about your relationship and the way you and he interact that makes his girlfriends uncomfortable.

And OP, as much as you try to avoid this, it could be out of your control.

You need to have a convo about this w him because it's happening too often."

"She's a kid. Don't forget that. Yes she can drive and vote and work, but ultimately she is still wanting the approval of her peers and to fit a particular image. You might need to wait decades before she grows up on this one.

Australia is an incredibly racist place. If she embraces her heritage then it's likely she will become someone who ticks an equality box on some paperwork. People WILL treat her differently. She will be expected to represent a group that she wants nothing to do with. She might be held up as an example of a successful indigenous lawyer - which she obviously doesn't want. She might just want to be a successful lawyer.

When I was her age, I rejected my family background too. It took a long time to grow up and be ok with it. My parents sent me to upper class schools and never taught me about our family history. All I saw was that our extended family was demanding, lazy, oppressed and poor. I didn't have any positive role models to help shape my attitude. Has your daughter had any? Or are you expecting too much?


The real problem isn't so much that she's hiding her heritage. Lots of people do that for a range of reasons. The problem is more that she is being racist and cruel. Which might just be a youth thing. Have you ever talked to her about equality? Did you make any efforts to educate her about her background? Or have you raised her to be 'better' than others? Did other people inform her world view? There's a difference between providing someone with opportunity and instilling in them a sense of superiority.

She doesn't have to like her extended family, or associate with them. She doesn't have to invite them to events or friend them on Facebook. One day she might show an interest in her background, but for now she wants to blend in."
"I don't think you're unreasonable to want a little ""me"" time to relax and enjoy life and help you get out of your funk.

I DO think you're unreasonable in the single-minded way you seem to be approaching this. **You** have the money in the bank so **you** want to go where **you** want to go without taking your husband's feelings into consideration. Generally married couples work as a team, and if one of them has concerns (which, in this case, sound perfectly reasonable) the best way to approach them is to talk about them and reach a compromise that takes everyone's feelings into consideration.

Does it have to be California? Does it have to be right NOW (i.e.- before you have your depression under control, when he might rightfully worry about you ""struggling to get out of bed"" in a strange place without him there to help you)? Does it have to be one long trip, or could you take several shorter outings?

"Way down beneath a few of his down voted comments, OP says at one point his parents sued for partial custody. I can't believe his wife didn't make him choose then. She's a saint, and his parents are completely insane."
"Hoo boy. It sounds like Gary's been spending the night SOMEwhere. I'd put money on him cheating, just not with OP. It sounds like OP just happened to be the person wife latched onto because reasons. But I'm betting there's a LOT that OP doesn't know about Gary."
"Are you the sole breadwinner in the family? Does she stay home with the kids? You said that you bought the car and paid for it with your own money. If you are in a marriage where one of you has agreed to raise the kids and not work, then it's not entirely fair to use the ""i paid for it, so it's mine and you don't get a say"" argument. I'm not saying you're wrong, but if you are the sole breadwinner then technically everything is yours and she gets no say over anything- including groceries, her own clothes, her kid's toys, etc. She might feel some resentment that you are deciding that you get complete control over something because you paid for it, while she doesn't have an income of her own. A possible compromise might be that you take her for joy rides. My parents used to do this. They each had their ""own cars"" (despite the fact that my mother technically earned all the income in my household) and they still each got to enjoy the new cars, just from the passenger seat. Also, maybe just sell one of the other vehicles and let her pick out her own car for herself after discussing that she won't drive your car anymore if she gets her very own. "
"I deeply wish my mother had given me her maiden name instead of my father's name. His side of the family are all crooked cops and racists and child abusers, thieves and liars--with one sole exception, my very sweet great-grandfather, who I met once before his death.  The fact that he existed is one of very few reasons that I've kept this name as long as I have.

It depends on the business that you work in. In all honesty, were I you, I'd consider changing my own surname.  Perhaps the three of you could pick something as a sign of your new family."

You don't just consistently physically collide with an individual without realizing it for three years! He isn't an atomic particle whizzing through space without control of himself!

The more you post here, the more uneasy I feel. He just disregards you. You don't matter to him near as much as he does. When you don't want him to wake you up in the middle of the night or he walks into you, *it inconveniences him*. That's spooky. He just doesn't care about you as much as he cares about himself."
He has every right to not have sex for ANY reason.
Stories like this are why I haven't turned into a COMPLETE jaded cynic thanks to this sub. Congrats!
After her harping about receiving an inheritance from YOUR parents I can't imagine how satisfying giving her those ashes were. 
"He said elsewhere in this thread that after his daughter was born, his parents got a lawyer and tried to sue them for partial custody--so I think OP has a superhero-level ability to ignore the ridiculousness of a situation. Given that his parents tried to squeeze themselves into a parenting role in their grandchild's life *using legal force*, their continuing inappropriate behavior is not shocking at all.

Frankly, I'm amazed that none of this has been a deal-breaker for his wife. I wouldn't stay with a husband who'd been behaving the way OP has."
"I'm surprised she's not more angry at you for blatantly disrespecting something she asked you not to do. The way I see it you're lucky it's just the best man speech she wants to cut.

"Easiest way to go through your house and touch every surface without looking overly suspicious: dusting. 

Clean up a couple other things first, like maybe straighten stuff up and windex some glass surfaces. Then, start in one corner, and methodically dust from up above to down below, touching everything, and make your way around the outside of the home to the middle. In the process, look closely and touch everything. 

As others have suggested with the router, the dusting could also be a good way to ""accidentally"" unplug it too. "

Are you sure your mom doesn't have some sort of real mental problem that's suddenly rearing its head?
Go - you'll always regret it if you don't. If she can't be upfront with an actual reason then you shouldn't jeopardise your future by turning down the opportunity.
"First off, this doesn't even need to be a separate conversation. Next time she's making noise at your door, bang on it, or open it up, and say ""I am trying to sleep. You've being very loud, 3 feet from my bed. Would you please move this somewhere else? Thank you.""

But if you'd rather approach it at another time, you don't have to mention the crying specifically. Just describe it as ""noise"", at an unreasonable hour.

""Hey crybaby: I know you want to keep in regular touch with your bf. But your conversations get pretty loud. Also you've been having them three feet from my bed. Because of the late hour, your daily midnight skype sessions have been making me lose sleep. Can you please find somewhere else to have them?""

"I wouldn't read this as a romantic gesture, honestly, but rather an idiotic continuation to a stupid joke as a graduation gift. 

Some people who drink see those who don't as actively passing judgement on their choices and have a problem with that. These people are morons, but they definitely exist. Sounds like Dylan falls squarely into this category.

I'd just text him and tell him that everyone on your floor really enjoyed his leaving present, and suggest he ask what they'd like next time he's feeling so generous. On the off chance that this *was* a romantic gesture (which, again, I'm 99% sure it wasn't), this'll make it clear you read it as buddies. On the other hand, if this was one last dig at your teetotalism, this'll show him you're still cool with other people drinking while making a different choice for yourself. Plus it'll make it clear that he wasted his money, which will hopefully hurt at least a bit.

"It could be a mixture of shock, reality setting in, and the frustration of seeing future plans get tossed around that's causing him to act this way. 

That being said, passive-aggressive snark, snide comments, and flat-out insults to you are not acceptable in any way. 

I'm concerned because - based on his comments - he seems to almost be blaming you for getting pregnant or something.

You need to have serious sit down where you discuss what's going on and why he's feeling/acting the way he is. He's being very disrespectful. Hopefully, he'll realize he's been a jerk and will apologize and open up about his fears and insecurities going into the pregnancy. 

He has *got* to talk about this, though. "

"**The following is valid primarily for programming jobs, I am unaware of how recruiting goes for other jobs**

Your recruiter has a relationship with the company. She gets paid money to fill a position with them. However other recruiters are also vying to fill that position. The recruiter wants you to go so that company B likes her more because she is bringing them people. The company isn't going to remember your name and hold it against you. They will move on to the next candidate.

You have already taken a position. You aren't going to take that other position. Tell the recruiter to cancel the interview. Also remember that the recruiter isn't working with you because you are a cool dude. The recruiter is working with you because when you take a job, she gets money. If you are a contract to hire or contractor with her company then her company is getting money for every hour you work. If you ever need to work with them again they will work with you because that is how they make money.

Recruiters generally don't give a shit about you. They give a shit about their income. "

She says she pays me back for all of this with emotional support and that it balances out. I don't feel like it does, though.

"If your atheist boyfriend wants you to convert to Catholicism before you get married, he might not be an atheist.  He's marrying you, not his mother."
You should pick a charity for LGBT people or one specifically for spreading marriage equality.
"He was cheating on you with her and then hid hoping that he wouldn't get caught, 100%. They probably didn't realize you were coming up, just that *someone* was and that's why the girl tried to casually walk out. It probably made it even worse that it was you (on her end anyways.) "
"I should just try to move on and not wait for her to come back into my life.

I know it's what I need to do, I'll just need a lot of time to do it.

I'm lost with no one physically to confide in, I've read the stupid note probably 20 times.

I'm so pathetic for even trying to hold on, my friends are right that she's likely bad news but you know.. "
"You have two choices: 

- Quit your job, stay home, be stuck there forever (or until your sister decides to tell your parents anyway as punishment for some other percieved fault - and she will use this to manipulate you over and over and over again. Blackmail doesn't end.).

Or

- Move out, continue your job and schooling, live your life the way you want.

Which will make you happier?

Think of how you want your life to be in 5, 10, 20 years. Leaving is going to be really hard right now, but in the long run it'll probably be the easier option.

Make sure you take as many documents as you can get (birth certificate, passport, ID, paperwork for school etc), and get out. Change your registered recidence with your school, work, and government asap. Inform your school and your work that your family is under no circumstances to be allowed to recieve any information about you.

If you fear for your safety when your family finds out, please talk to the police! You can also reach out to a womans shelter, to get more information about how to keep your whereabouts secret. Your family should not know where you are living."
"&gt;He basically said it was non-negotiable.

lulz. Everything is negotiable. Hopefully he learns some flexibility before parenthood whacks him upside the head.


Sounds like your real issue is feeling excluded from the naming process, which is disrespectful. A partnership shouldn't involve unilateral decisions. Talk about that, and of course, you always have the middle name compromise."
"Well make an effort to be this guys friend. His mom died,  he's basically coming to live with complete strangers. Y'all probably have common interests and both of you are probably really confused by this. "
"Sister should absolutely report this to the police. Even if someone was cheating, that doesn't make it okay for mom to assault them. There is no scenario where mom would have been justified in her behavior. "
"Exactly.

&gt; ""How's my baby doing in there?"" ""Are you taking good care of my baby?"" **""When my baby comes, I'm going to steal her away from you.""**

Yeah, you need to shut this shit down, pronto. These sound like a joke but some entitled grandmothers actually believe them.

My favorite response for every time she says this: *""Oh, you're pregnant, too?""*"
"do you know which companies? if so call them and tell them you did not authorize usage, if that doesnt work simply call card companies and report card as stolen"
"Or ""I don't think I would call working and saving for years 'luck,' but thank you."" Or ""If you want to be an enabler I can't stop you, but I also can't be one myself."" Or just ""No."" Regardless, don't treat it like a discussion or a negotiation. Make your comment, and then end the conversation."
"I don't think she's considering anything other than what she wants, not her husband's valid concerns, not the danger to her unborn baby, just the fact that she wants to have fun. The therapist sounds like an absolute idiot. "
"what she eats is up to her but it's up to you to voice your concerns. Do so in a way that is direct, kind and clear, like: ""I'm worried about the change in your eating habits, can we talk about it?"" 

Your post reads like you're more bewildered and grossed out by he laziness, rather than her actual weight. Make it clear that you're more concerned by how she doesn't seem to care about her insides, than the weight gain. 

She might want to change and she might not, that's not up to you, but you need to discuss it with her to figure out where you go from here. "
"Giving someone additional info and motivation to steer clear of a dangerous person isn't stupid, good for you.  

Now be careful that he can't get any of your personal information like where you live.  Chances are low that he would come after you but it is a risk.  Time to do a security check on your public information.  "

Congratulations! "
"Honestly, you sound pretty shallow, and very focused on the way women look. Hope your girlfriend doesn't realise one day that sweats are more comfortable than pretty girly dresses and heels.

 There's nothing you can do about your ex shit talking - she has plenty of reason to feel the way she does, and unless it's actively affecting your relationship with your daughters, you'll just need to suck it up and take the high road.

Edit: I don't understand why you mention not wanting another legal battle... Is this really something you think it's appropriate to go to court over?"
Tell her flat out no you cant risk it. Youve worked hard to get a nice life for yourself. Dont get manipulated into taking on 3 or soon 4? people
"I also love how OP's parents and relatives are all for spanking their children but when asked by their children why they're being spanked they can't explain and instead get mad and run to OP and his wife to cry and complain. 

They know they're wrong and don't want to face their own kids so they're just going to make it so everyone gets spanked. "
"No one is more zealous than a new convert.  

She has this new thing that she feels makes her superior to others and now she's got to let everyone know how cool and awesome she is.

More than anything is seems like a cry for attention from someone who has low self-esteem.  If she had proper self-esteem, she would just eat vegan food and shut up about it.  

It's definitely a sign of immaturity, but hey, she's 18.  Immaturity is basically a given at that age.  Try talking with her and seeing if she would be willing to tone down the rhetoric a bit."
"That's what I'm afraid of, guess I was hoping strangers would see something I might've missed.  I really do love him and can't see myself marrying anyone else but this is something I can't overlook..."
"OP is a douche.

I love video games, I have loved playing doom. but guess what? it's pretty fucking violent.

kids don't fully grasp that what they see on TV is fake until they are 4-6 years old. billy is still very much in a stage of his life where he cannot fully figure out whether what he's seeing on tv is real or not.

furthermore, doom is the sort of game that isn't even just mildly violent or something. it is an aggressive game."
"Nothing they can do? Bullshit.

His employer owns the house? Contact them also
"Perhaps it would be best that you stick to coffee, lunch, friendly things while his divorce is being processed. You can get to know him better and ask about his divorce before you decide anything.

As for the age gap, the older you get the less it matters. If he is just getting divorced he likely isn't in a huge rush to remarry right?

It's super cute that his coworkers knew he was waving at the cute girl in the next building, and I think that says something about him as a person. 

I'm very glad your coffee sign worked!"
"I'm sorry you're in this situation- I relate to the sexual rejection and it does suck.  I'm also glad for you though, because now you have the chance to find a partner who desires every bit of you and will be both a morning and night person when it comes to sex- maybe afternoon too! :) good luck lady. "
I sneezed in the interviewers face. Shit happens
"For the record, a friend of mine was in a situation very similar to yours. She eventually bent to her bf's will and named their daughter after his ex. Years later, they are no longer together and she says every time she thinks of her daughter's actual name (everyone calls the daughter by her nickname), she gets a twinge of disgust in herself and with him.  She's concerned that one day the girl will decide to go by her full name.  Is that really how you want to feel when you look at your daughter? "
Accept. Grieve. Adapt. Move on. She made her choice.
"Well, I'm assuming the front door is at or near the living room?  It is in most houses...  And then with the time that she was IN the kitchen, she had been out and then came home after 11 pm.  I'm assuming she at least walked through the living room, or the dark house all of a sudden had lights get turned on, noises happened that carried, etc.  So it could be potentially just one room.  I agree that she should have the place looked over though because theoretically he could have one mike/camera or 3 in each room for all we know.  I'm hoping that at worst he's bugging one room, but...

Also, if you were, hypothetically, going to bug the house to check up on your wife while you were gone, why would you do so?  Either you'd do it for her security (at which point, why not tell her?) or you  would do it because of paranoia about cheating.  Personally, wouldn't you bug the bedroom?  That way you'd ideally catch them in the act if you were worried about cheating?  I really hope the OP updates because this is so damn creepy."
"Not even that, but she gave her the log in info.. as a security guy that means she has a username, email and a corresponding password...

If OP is like 99% of everyone in the world, that password and email is more than likely linked to other accounts (bank, email, etc). Her mom could do A LOT of damage if she wanted to."
"Ugh.... bad move on bf part.  He got you a dog, a lifetime responsibility knowing your housing issue.  And you put it on your mom who is already financially strapped, working two jobs and has dementia?  Seriously, this had no way if ending well.  "
"For gods sake don't take him to your house if you aren't planning on continuing the relationship. Just tell him you are fed up of him drinking, smoking and shitting on your carpet, then walk away."
"She needs addiction counseling. You absolutely should leave her if she refuses. It doesn't matter how long you've been together. 

You've got to do everything you can to not make your life more difficult. Being with an addict who refuses treatment is the hard road in life. 

So, do whatever you want, but if you stay with her everything that happens is by your choice. "
"Why are you putting up with this??? Tell that asshat to get his shit together or tell him to go fuck himself. 

Now this is my more rational side I think you need some marriage counseling. He is not giving one fuck about your feelings and this needs to stop. That chick has insulted you and your marriage and hubby still wants to see her? Time for some good old ultimatums or a trip to the lawyer's office."
"I think it also helps that OP's child is not legally born yet, so no one has signed any papers regarding parenthood.

Keep strong OP!"
"To be fair, to a vegan, eating meat is sort of like metaphorically kicking kittens. Meat is just so normalized in society that most people don't see it that way. But she has to realize imposing your morality on others is not going to work. You have to have them willingly come to your side, because society is not on your side on this one."
"Lol, what? 

Dude, abort mission."
"I would be wary of her motives for pushing this relationship so fast, so I definitely wouldn't recommend that you rent a place with her now or in July. 

I think you should go with your original plan and move home while she stays in the University City. See each other when you are able and if that doesn't work, go your separate ways."
there are local services to help your sister. call a local youth center. or her school counselor. or your college health center.
"Well, aside from the fact that he physically abused your mother which makes him an asshole ... yes, this is creepy and he's disrespecting you and probably disrespecting women in general. 

How would he react to you trying to set boundaries? If he becomes threatening maybe it would make sense to move out now. Can you live with your mother?"
"I'll be honest.....if I were your girlfriend, and you managed to convince me that you're not gay after all, I still wouldn't be chomping at the bit to marry you after this.  I mean:
&gt;Now, I am somewhat infamous amongst our friend group for sending out dick pics pretty early to girls I'm dating or want to date.

is pretty much the most unappealing thing ever.  You might have to prove to her that you've changed since you were younger, and based on the dick pic war.....doesn't really sound like you have.  "
"A lot of girls go through this phase. Yelling at her, telling her he's a creep, forbidding her from seeing him - these things sound like good ideas but they won't work. 

Here are a few things that will:

1. **Teach her to drive.** Pay for lessons and help her practice. She should have a driver's license. If you can afford it, help her get a car. It can be a beater. But the independence of having her own transportation will be empowering. 

2. **Help her get her GED**. She wants to be a SAHM because she feels worthless and that's easy. Suggest she take some classes at a community college. Maybe recommend her for a babysitting or catering gig. Show her that she can do it and has a future. Pressuring her to get her GED probably won't work, but you can plant the seeds that will ultimately motivate her to pursue it herself. 

3. **Meet her boyfriend**. Make it clear you won't tolerate any shenanigans. Make it clear if he's serious about your daughter he *will not* pull her away from her family. He's older and that's creepy but that doesn't mean he gets to shirk out of family dinners, parties, and holidays. If he is serious about your daughter he can act like a serious boyfriend. Get his information so that he can be an active participant in helping your daughter learn to drive and get a job. "
"He's so wonderful and kind. He asks me to do sex acts I'm uncomfortable with, doesn't like to hear no, doesn't want to have emotional conversations, drinks to the point of excess every night, and doesn't want to hear about when you are hurt and essentially raped you. He sounds like a great guy!

You don't make him understand. He doesn't give a shit. You are a blow-up doll to this guy. You move on and work on figuring out why you have such low self-esteem that you would stay with someone like this."
"Do nothing. Ignore him and don't respond.  

That you still have an emotional response to your ex just means you're a living, breathing, human. Don't sweat it. But don't encourage him by dignifying his email with a response. Your ex has nothing to do with your fiance and his perfect proposal. Your ex can't take that away from you unless you let him. "
"He has no business getting people dogs. 

Google the phrase 'you shouldn't give pets as gifts' 

Honestly it's a terrible thing to do to an animal if things don't work out. Pets should be planned like babies. "
"&gt;on several occasions he has said that having a girl would be his worst nightmare

Oh fuuuuck that. What an asshole.

Have you said ""BF, when you say having a daughter is your worst nightmare, it makes me wonder if you're going to treat a daughter horribly. There's a 50/50 chance, you know""?"
":( I hadn't realized that this is a common issue... Who would do that to little kids! I hope OP goes to the police with this, it's not fair at all. "
I don't have good vibes from this guy. I'd suggest you distance yourself from him.

"omg no DO NOT FOLLOW ANY OF THE ADVICE PEOPLE ARE GIVING YOU HERE

this man is abusive as hell or he wouldn't be spying on you and trying to control you like this. odds are there were a lot of small early warning signs that you missed because you weren't looking out for them.

whatever you do DO NOT ANTAGONIZE HIM, do not confront him, do not let him suspect you know. the safest thing to do is honestly to just get out as soon as possible.

try and trick him into thinking you're cheating on him???? what the fuck is wrong with the people in this thread, oh my god, this could become dangerously violent so quickly????

whatever you do please be careful and please be safe."
"She thinks it's pretty ridiculous and always tries to defend me/my boyfriend whenever he talks about it. She talked to me two weeks ago about how I should just wait for it to ""blow over.""

But it's been THREE WEEKS..."
"No, you're not making these girls gay. You're probably attracted to queer women, and you're at an age where they are likely to start questioning and exploring their sexuality. It's not anything you're doing."
"14 is plenty old enough to understand the ethical arguments for and against veganism.

Personally, my siblings and I were raised vegetarian, but given the choice to have meat school dinners as soon as we started school aged 4. We understood what meat was by that point. My brother chose to eat meat, my sister and I chose to remain vegetarian. 20 odd years later, I'm still vegetarian, my sister is a very committed vegan and after a brief animal rights phase my little brother eats a limited amount of meat. Kids don't follow your ethical beliefs because you impose them upon them with an iron will, they need to find their own way and come to their own conclusions. Having rulEs about what foods you will have in your house is reasonable, but outside the house should be free reign. 14 year olds have that teenage rebellious spirit and the harder you crank down on him, the more committed he is likely to become to eating animal products. If you back off and give him the space to come to his own conclusions, he might still decide to be vegan or find a diet that he feels is an ethical compromise."
"I'm thinking that the insomnia might play into this too.  She (Stacy) might be doing it in her sleep, or in a sleep-like state, and not remembering. "
"Your girlfriend knows this about her brother and still tried to get him a job with kids. She treats you like crap even though she seems to be entirely dependent on your family's charity. You are deeply miserable, and guess what? She's a grown woman who needs to figure out how to take care of herself and she never will so long as you play doormat. Even if you can't muster the courage to cut the cord for your own sake and your family's, DO IT FOR THOSE KIDS. The idea that you'd allow a god damn Nazi access to children to avoid your girlfriend's wrath is sickening. Look at yourself, man. Who are you? What have you become?"
"""Rebecca, I'm sure you never intended for this to be hurtful, but I'm still coming to terms with the fact my sister is gone.  As far as I'm concerned, naming this baby after her is going to be an incredibly painful reminder of her absence.  And while I realize this is your decision, as my friend, I'm asking you to reconsider.""

Or you could just go ahead and distance yourself, if you're tired of all the drama and attention-seeking anyway.  In which case, you probably don't have to be so diplomatic should you decide to say anything."
He played in college for a d3 school and now he sells insurance lol
"Well.. 

if the sex is consensual, and the tape was made consensually, and your parents do contact the police.. all you need to do is tell the police that it was consensual sex.  As far as I know...as long as your husband is not breaking the law in the video, the police can't do anything if you (the supposed victim) don't want to press charges."
"Unless you're engaged and have a date set for the wedding, it seems like she's being a bit premature, and perhaps even a bit immature. I would also like to see this 2k poncho as prior to that detail I was picturing a snuggie... "
"That was my first thought as well.  I think his behavior is SCREAMING ""I'm buying a ring, I want us to start making decisions as a couple,"" but I think he's acting pretty childish about it.

I mean, it's not like OP is taking a trip to Vegas with a bunch of her single friends or anything.  This is just a traditional family trip."
"If your wretched teenage past comes back to haunt you, it'll go better the more gracefully you handle it. For example:

""God, yes, that was absolutely shitty of me, I was such an asshole back then, and I'm embarrassed every time I think about it. I'm so sorry. I'd never do anything like that these days, but I understand if the people who I hurt back then aren't inclined to trust me now. I'll personally apologize to anyone who'd like me to; otherwise, I'm not contacting anyone I harassed before, to respect their privacy now.""

You can also work on building a good track record now. When women you know on social media get harassed, you can call people out on that--if those women are comfortable with you doing so. (Ask first, don't just barge in; some of them may prefer to avoid escalation.) You keep your interactions with women online respectful and polite, and avoid jokes or teasing that could read the wrong way to outsiders. A sincere apology for past behavior will look all the more sincere if it's backed up by your current behavior."
"&gt; How do I help him?

This isn't (or shouldn't be) a long-term relationship for you. Fundamentally, the person you're with will want to build you up and make you happier and able to invest in your future. Sacrificing your school to entertain him for a summer is not in your interest and a good partner won't want that for you, even if they're disappointed they won't spend as much time with you.

Secondly, the fact is you don't need a reason like school to not want to spend the summer with him: you tried it, it was unpleasant, period. That's enough of a reason not to do it again, and also a strong indicator you should probably not be in this relationship.

So, you probably help him most in the long run by being clear and tactful and communicate that the relationship should probably be over. That's my overall advice.

&gt; Is it normal for him to feel this way?

It's not usual, but it's not normal.

&gt; Is he being dramatic and to codependent?

Yes, probably, unless he doesn't get to see you at all unless you're staying with him.

&gt; Is he relying on me to make himself happy?

It sounds like it's even simpler, he's relying on you to entertain him.

&gt; Did I make the wrong choice?

No, free school is a great opportunity, an investment that pays lifetime dividends.

&gt; Am I wrong to feel like he is being unreasonable?

You are not wrong."
"Good call

Hi OP's creepy-ass husband! **waving**

Project much, you cheating fuck?"
"Jesus your bf's Mom is the one that should be embarrassed. 

You need to say no next time, and tell your boyfriend to support you. It sounds like he would, since he told you you didn't need to drink! So why would you drink? You don't have to prove ANYTHING to his mom and if she's still stuck in some bullying sorority girl mindset, that's just sad and pathetic of her. Don't let her drag you down, stay true to yourself and your drink limit. This entire thing only becomes an issue if your boyfriend won't have your back."
Vegetarianism like religion is a personal choice and I think you should have your son's back on this
"Oh, OP, I am so sorry. 

Is you mother getting mental health treatment? If not, why not?


I wish you the very best. Stay busy and be happy."
"This may have scared Aaron more, to be honest. It's like taking everything you've learned on paper and being forced to apply it in real life under immense scrutiny from your girlfriend. Proof of immense scrutiny = you're considering a break up after one interaction. Don't push him. Trust that you've chosen a worthy partner and let him come around on his own. If he doesn't, then make another choice. "
"HOW DOES HE NOT SEE HOW
RIDICULOUS THIS IS?!? "
"I'm going to be very harsh here: if I were your fiancée, I would break up with you over this.  You sound spineless,  and you aren't demonstrating remorse.  

Why is this guy taking precedence over your SO? Why are you being stubborn? "
"There was a thread a year or so ago about w girl whose parents preferred her twin sister over her. She moved out at 18 and stopped speaking to them and they tried to crawl back into her life after her sister moved out because they were lonely.

Maybe they should have thought about the potential consequences of their behaviour before doing it?"
"I'm not sure if I've ever cried this hard in my life from reading a post online. For heaven's sake, please don't get back in contact with them. There is nothing stopping them from ripping apart old wounds. They made their choice. You were forced to endure years of pain because of them. If you haven't already done so, seek counseling. The person will probably tell you the same thing. For your physical and emotional health, tell those monsters who would dare call themselves parents to LEAVE YOU THE FUCK ALONE."
All of this in four months????
"He's not over her, and I think him wanting to name your daughter after her as a creepy tribute is nauseating.

You said they are currently still friends? As in, this woman would be fully aware that your baby is named for her? I'm so sorry, I'd be horrified about this."
I know.
"Maybe ""guy who touches you creepily while you are asleep"" to ""guy who sexually assaults you while you are asleep"" is a progression that u/artfulwench feels is likely?"
"Lie. Lie like a rug. In fact, bring it up with coworkers first. Talk about how they are like sisters to you so your mom calls you all her daughters though she sometimes likes to embarrass you by implying that you're all living scandalously. Mothers, amirite? Tell your boss the same thing, it's a joke because you three are such close friends. Then start looking for another job. Get out of this one as soon as you can."
"&gt;I told her she was probably at the age where she would notice differences between boys and girls and should probably have a better awareness of human anatomy.

Dude WHAT. That was a deeply stupid thing to say. MAYBE she's at that age, maybe not, MAYBE IT'S NOT YOUR DECISION. I get that it was an accident, but you should have covered up or asked the kid to give you privacy. You should have just apologized to your girlfriend, but no - you doubled down and acted like it was a positive or ""educational"" thing that this kid saw your dick. If I was your girlfriend I'd be having second thoughts about you."
"I can't be the only one who was shocked he's actually HOME, near OP, and she didn't know Kayla was already there visiting him?! What! In his parents' house, presumably?! What the actual fuck?"
You have 5 minutes of sex? Does he make you finish? Or is it all about him? I'd have a huge problem with my partner not being willing to work on any issue that is serious/important to me.  
"For now, do nothing and enjoy the quiet for as long as it lasts.  I bet your mother is trying to punish you by avoiding you, and hopefully you won't have to see her for a few weeks.  Best wishes for your new baby!!"
"Has he ever dictated what you wear before?
Thigh highs are usually fetishized by porn industry, so thats where the ""too sexy"" line of thought may be coming from.
My theory is:
-He finds them sexy, and therefore assumes the roommate finds it sexy.
-He may have caught the roommate checking you out, but instead of being an adult and confronting roommate he is taking it out on you.

Your only solution is to sit him down when you are both a lil calmer and ask him again. Something along the lines of ""Hey, is there another reason why you don't like me wearing those socks? You know I **NEED** to wear them, right?

Personally, I wouldn't be surprised if the new roommate checked you out or made a lewd comment, and instead of shutting him down, tried to take the alternative route by making YOU change."
"I am so glad you called OP out on this. /u/DoomDad16 , time you spend playing video games with your kid in the room is not you spending time with your child.  It's great if you do that together sometimes, with age appropriate games, but don't pretend it's the face to face interaction that he needs from you."
"AWWW YEAH Baby has the same due date as my birthday, this is a mark of great destiny and power! You are giving birth to a LEGEND"
"I think she might be afraid that you'd expect HER to be the chef and maid once you move in together.

Also, you need to at least know HOW to do these things. Can you make a good omlette? Salad? Spaghetti? Can you wash your own clothes without wrecking them? Personally I'd think it was a lityle weird but definitely not a deal breaker unless you CAN'T do these things. How about you go 6 weeks doing 90% if it on your own just to brush up on your skills?  No one I know wants to marry Bertie Wooster. "
"Best insight right here.  You're right, he **wants** OP to feel he knows all/sees all. That's a very unhealthy, unsafe home. "
"Piggybacking on this to say that you always have the option of sending the hair off yourself! When I donated my hair to cancer, I would have it cut at the salon (always make sure they fully understand you're donating it; it should be put in a ponytail and then cut off about two inches about the ponytail holder), and I would bring an envelope and ask them to put the cut-off ponytail into the envelope and give to me to mail directly. That way you're sure it's being sent off, and to the charity you've chosen. "
"Hehe. One of my good friends is almost 7 feet tall, all legs, and probably no more than 140lbs.  He sits exactly like this, like a goddamn preying mantis. It's awkward to sit with your knees together in a chair too small for you because it redirects the pressure to your back. It hurts. "
"&gt; Australia is an incredibly racist place. If she embraces her heritage then it's likely she will become someone who ticks an equality box on some paperwork. People WILL treat her differently. She will be expected to represent a group that she wants nothing to do with. She might be held up as an example of a successful indigenous lawyer - which she obviously doesn't want. She might just want to be a successful lawyer.

As a fellow Australian, I really want to re-iterate this. 

Australia is an **incredibly racist country**. Indigenous people are particularly looked down upon by a huge percentage of the population. 

This girl *will be treated differently* if she is 'openly indigenous' and most of it will not be pretty. People will assume anything she achieved is because she 'played the aboriginal card'. People will question if she even got into law school on her own merits and call into doubt her ability. A lot of people will be racist to her.

I can't blame a 19 year old girl who wants to be a lawyer deciding she just wants to keep her mouth shut about it and just say her father is from South Africa and she likes the Springboks when people are talking about their family. A White Afrikaner isn't going to be accused of 'getting into Law School because they're aboriginal' or accused of only getting their job because 'they're trying to hire aboriginal people'. "
"GUYS:

DON'T DO THIS"
"Also, if she tells your parents you slept with a girl, act offended. She is threatening to do a lot more, just say she is obviously making up shit and you are ashamed to have such a selfish, ungodly sister."
Like the woman who put her son's GF in the hospital for days because she didn't believe she had gluten intolerance.
"Tell her to stop following you or you're going to call the cops. Then, follow though. Block her on everything. Go absolutely no contact with her. Do not respond or react to her attempts at communication. If it progresses, you may need to take out a restraining order. Stop being a doormat and stand up for yourself. This girl is toxic. You're doing the right thing. Stay strong."
You've got the right attitude about finding someone who actually accepts your situation. It seems that Anna simply couldn't get past the mindset that extra money for your son was simply that and nothing else. Good luck and I hope you find someone worthy or you.

Break up with him because he's nuts.

"OP has been in kids lives since they were approx 10 and 13. Either way, I have a hard time believing OP's husband never noticed the way they have been acting towards her for 6 goddamn years and it never occured to ANYONE to address it before marriage."
"Jesus Christ woman, get out of there."
Wow. If my in-laws tried to sue me for custody of MY OWN CHILD they would literally never see that child again in their lives. Your wife is being a lot more reasonable about them than you're giving her credit for. Jesus H. Christ. 
OP is probably just worried with the rash of posts lately of men in their late 30s hitting up women who are barely in their 20s. Can't say I blame her! 
"Hey OP - this is harassment on the part of your ex.  Tell your parents, report his behaviour to the school and ask them to handle this issue.  

As an example of how this can escalate: if the school doesn't step in to do something about it, you and your parents are well within rights to go to the police.

"You say once clearly in writing ""I'm shocked and appalled by Bill's will as it is completely inaccurate.  We never had an affair and there was never anything romantic or sexual between us. I understand how upsetting this is, but I hope you can reflect back on my character over the years and our friendship and realize I would never betray my husband, your trust in me, or actively seek to harm and disrespect anyone else's marriage. I know I can offer no proof of this, but if you think of anything I can do please let me know. I'm happy to call my cell phone company to retrieve any record of calls, texts, etc. if possible.  To forward all email communication between us to read, to take a lie detector test (though I recognize the potential inaccuracies with that) or to allow a private investigator access to whatever they may need to prove that the claim of an affair is unsubstantiated.  I can also have my husband provide a list of nights I was away from home in order to cross check with your own recollections. Obviously under these circumstances I don't feel comfortable accepting the money or the car since it is clear Bill was not in a healthy mental state  or himself when he gave it to me. I am happy to return these things to you, his wife, who I know he loved very much. If you feel uncomfortable accepting the car or money I will be giving them to charity. 

Bill was clearly behaving erratically towards the end of his life and I can't imagine how much pain this is causing all involved.  I understand all of this is shocking and upsetting and can't imagine what you both are going through right now.  I understand if you need space and time to process everything and am absolutely willing to give you that space. I also understand if this is too painful to allow our friendship to continue in the same way that it has, although I very much wish to continue our friendship as you both mean a lot to me.  Please know that I my end I will always be your loyal friend and will try to do whatever I can to support you, even if that means staying away.  I'm going to give you whatever space you need but please know the door is always open on my end. I hope that when you've had time to reflect you will realize what an honorable person Bill was and know that this letter is completely incompatible with the reality of the situation and more reflective of someone who was suffering a lot at the end of his life.""

There is a good chance being off his meds may be an influencing factor. He is also likely cheating. If he does not want to be with you then tell him to move out.

Also you need to set him down and have a serious talk.  Tell him if he won't go to her, you will, and he probably won't like that option.

"
"Friends: who the fuck is he hanging out with? Identify the bad seeds and cut him off from those influences.



Lies: he will lie to you about the stash and you will probably want to believe him. Grab a piece of his hair and test it for drugs. You gotta know what you're dealing with.



Signs: know the signs of drug use. Opiates = pinpoint pupils. 



Precautions: I hate to say this but I'd prepare for a long, uphill battle. Get Narcan. It could save his life. 



CBT: he goes to one.

You're a giver.  I understand that.  He was unworthy of your generosity.  Hopefully as you grow and form new relationships, you'll be able to see that in other people earlier on.

Good luck, and don't lose hope in everyone.  Just be a little cautious before you be someone's meal ticket."

"Tattoo aside.. I wouldn't have been comfortable with my boyfriend living with a woman who loved him, and who he clearly had feelings for (slept together, best friends... Thats an ideal relationship for some people... Not roommates...)

So yeah.. All of that is iffy, not just the tattoo. "
"Damn. That's heartbreaking. The best thing I think you can do for her is to keep encouraging her therapy and joining social activities or even online communities and putting herself out there. And just keep loving her and being a listening ear. She doesn't have to be the belle of the ball, even one friend can be the One who changes everything, and that could happen at any time. "
"I think you could also take the angle of ""Jody is a mom, I'm not a mom"" and have that be the reason. Kids that age are really into defined roles (my wife is a second grade teacher and every year her students' minds are *blown* when she says she married but doesn't have kids. They can't comprehend how that's possible because marriage=family to them). Make it clear you're the aunt but not a mom. By the time you have kids, she'll be able to grapple better with the realities (unless you're about to get pregnant)."
"Perfect response.  

Never lose your sense of humor, OP, even though you are upset right now.  "
"Your boyfriend and his sister have a connection that the two of you will never have, it's true; they're siblings. They grew up together. Is she more important to him than you are? Probably, in some ways. The different people in our lives fill different roles. No one person can be the sole source of all need fulfillment. 
His sister isn't a threat to your role in his life. Neither of you can be replaced with the other. It may be good for you to look inward, at your own insecurities, and really question where they come from."
"My dog's name is Lucy but when she's in trouble it's Lucille.

And I've never loved anyone more than that groomer"
"&gt;Edit: I feel like it's important to add that the wedding was two states away, so just going to one of the days is sort of a no option. It was commit to being gone for 3 whole days or don't go.

&gt;Edit: Also worth adding that he did not mention the wedding until the weekend before. Wasn't even formally invited. His mother was, but she couldn't attend, so she called and asked if he could in her place.

This really does change everything. You weren't invited to the wedding, you were invited to fill an open spot. You weren't given enough time to prepare, you didn't want to dedicate that many days to it, and you didn't want to have to buy a new dress for it. 

I think you were perfectly fine to not go. It would be completely different if you were going to be his +1 from the beginning."
"Move.

If you can work with your grandfather I suggest making every precaution possible that his will is asserted and recognised. Get a psych eval.. the works.

If I were you, Id tell grandfather what your uncle said, and explain him that you expect after he does pass, that you will be mired in lawsuits and the firm will suffer for it. Ask him to think of ways to go the legal route and preempt as much of the fall out as possible.


Your family is behaving like they are entitled to your grandfathers work. - They are not. 

You wouldnt be an arsehole or a bad person for acknowledging that your grandfather has the right to chose who inherits. Its unfortunate that you seem to think he is unjust in chosing you. It makes it seem as though you think his family is entitled, just because they are family. And they are not!

You cannot know, and your grandfather is not likely to share, just how hurt he is, over the lack of true interest in his life work his children has showed. Now, dont get me wrong. Your gramps is not entitled to little worker minions just because they are his kids, but that doesnt mean, it couldnt have been very hurtful to find they rejected his buisness. As a buisness man, it is SOUND of him to NOT advance people just for being family. - It is SOUND of him to chose you to be his heir. 

I suspect it would very much help you, to try and see things from his point of view, rather than fall into the pit of trying to assauge your guilty conscience by telling yourself he is an arse for chosing just you. Dont feel bad for the family. REMEMBER he gave everyone a shot, a chance, same as you.

You tell him you miscarried. Then you find someone to drive you. 
"I think you should call your brother on a friend's phone, away from home, and tell him what's going on, maybe even show him this Reddit thread. Get help from your family. Your situation doesn't sound safe, and it's unknown what your husband would do if the truth of his activities came to light.

Definitely don't deal with this alone. "
"She is overreacting, but there might be a reason you're not considering. I never had a similar incident, but my mom did take me aside one time after I was hanging out with my brother in his room to tell me that I was always welcome to talk to her about anything that happened and that I should make sure my relationship with my brother was appropriate. I was pretty confused but I just said it absolutely is, we were just talking about a computer game. She never mentioned it again. I found out later in life that her brother had molested her sister and tried to molest her. As much as she loved my brother and wanted to trust him, there was always that suspicion in the back of her mind because of her experience with her own brother. 

I'm not necessarily saying that's the case here, I'm just saying go easy on your mom, she probably only wants the best for you all. "
"If you really want to do it, it would be fairly simple, unless your husband has changed the access password for the router. Is he pretty tech savvy? 

Open a new tab in firefox/chrome/internet explorer/whatever and type in 192.168.1.1 and hit enter. If you get a box asking for a username and password, use another tab to google ""{router brand} default router password"". Usually some combination of ""root"" or ""admin"" for both username and password. 

If you can access your router firmware by getting logged in to that prompt, I can help you further. 

Feel free to PM me if you really want to pursue this. 

Edit since people are replying a bunch... 

Yes, 192.168.1.1 might not be the router IP, but in my experience it almost always is. I was trying to keep the basic instructions as simple as possible while still probably being correct. Adding technical steps like running ipconfig was something I purposely avoided (I actually had it typed up, but decided to delete it) 

Regardless, I'm still willing to help out via PM if OP wants. "
Of course he is resistant to it -- he's getting everything he wants with this proposed arrangement. Do what's best for you and your happiness. This sort of arrangement with this guy won't make you happy. 
Thank you my friends are telling me the same exact thing..I just have to build the courage and walk away now while I can 
"Dude, I think you just need to get a divorce. Your husband does NOTHING to support you emotionally, or to his family. He's spineless, and forcing you to deal with it. You'd have so much less stress dealing with his family.

And the fact that he didn't cut them off AFTER THEY HARASSED YOU AT WORK speaks volumes."
"Seriously? This may sound brash and whatnot, but you should consider yourself lucky you got to know her this side now, instead of later.

Dude?! You said she was perfect before! How the hell would you even know shes changed? Get out man, really. Good riddance."
"Plus Ops mom is basically blackmailing her (divorce your husband or else I will share this sex video of you with others.) going to the cops first will hopefully get OP to get a leg up on this, and they could report the theft of the video and find a way to get it back. Plus since the husband is in the military they probably want to get it resolved before it is posted online or he is retaliated against. "
"Tell him you're falling behind on your work and will be out of the house for office hours, then leave and go to the library. Once he has to supervise her he will start to recognise it is unsafe for his mother to be there. What happens when you're working and she poisons herself, sets a fire, falls etc? This unfair to you but also her as she's in an unsafe environment and probably lacks activities "
"She carried the urn around with her for weeks?? That's really crazy. Was she close to your mother, or is this is dramatic attention-seeking behavior?

Anyhow, she doesn't have any right to your mother's ashes. Next time she shows up at your house, call the cops."
"There is a lot that goes into this.  I am full-blooded Native American but from two different tribes.  I'm part of both, enrolled in one, and not really accepted by either.  Tribal Americans take their bloodlines very seriously because it is one of the last things we have and can protect from colonialism.  One thing you have to understand is that he probably doesn't directly dislike you but has a great dislike of white culture and you're trying to take away his daughter.  (I know it isn't actually like that, but you have to think in similar terms to try to understand how to react.)  

My father's tribe is patriarchal and my mother's tribe is matriarchal, Cheyenne and Navajo, so it was kind of a weird mixture of having to listen to both and offer that kind of loyalty to both.  It was a very difficult place to be constantly being pulled in two directions.  So, my point here is that tribal cultures take elders, respect, and honesty very seriously.  

Your girlfriend aside have you gone to him, talked to him, looked him in the eye and said you love his daughter and plan to take care of her with every means possible?  Does he see you as someone who is going to just take off?  You have to be a ""man"" in his eyes and a lot of the issue is that many tribes have their own rites of passage that denote whether or not someone is a man/adult.  You may not be able to be a part of the tribe but you might be able to approach him, to show him how serious you are, and offer to pass tests he has to offer.  It sounds archaic but that is part of the culture.  There is a slim chance this will be a reality but coming from your avenue you need to show him your determination and how you're not going to be deterred as a man, either.  

I think in order for your relationship with him to improve you should be talking more directly to him so you can express your intentions and your thoughts.  "
"I would listen to your daughter on this one. If Alex can't treat Blake like the family Blake is, then show alex the door. He says he's an adult, then he can support himself like an adult. When your husband gets back, tell him how fucked up it was to leave you to deal with this. Parenting is a partnership. He doesn't deserve to be called dad if he can't help you in situations like this. I'm glad Blake and violet have such a strong relationship. Good luck"
"When I was 16 (F) I fell asleep on a sectional couch with my second cousin, who I was close to. Our heads were touching each other, our bodies faced in different directions. Perfectly innocent. My uncle saw us, got angry and hollered at us to get up...

It was all innocent. It's adults who make situations inappropriate with their own fucked up thoughts. They project. 

Also, reminds me of another second cousin and her dad. She shared with me that when she became a teenager, he forbade her from eating bananas by peeling them and taking a bite of the fruit. He always made her peel the skin, break off the banana with her finger and put a piece of banana into her mouth. He said it was lewd for her to put the top of the banana into her mouth. She never understood until she got older and got married.

"&gt; My wife is absolutely refusing to budge on the issue and won’t try to compromise or muster up any empathy for me.

One, you can't compromise on something like this. You either hit the child or you don't, there is no half measure. Two, you want your wife to say it's okay for your parents to hit your daughter so that it stops hurting your parents' and siblings' feelings? **Seriously think about that**. **You want your child to be hit so your parents and siblings no longer feel upset**. Keep repeating this until you realize how messed up that sounds.

&gt; My nephew is seven, bright, and appears to have found my parents’ Achilles heel. They are at their wits end with these comments, which drive my mom to tears every time.

Yeah, well maybe your mother should stop hitting your nephew (and start putting him on 20 minute time outs) then maybe he won't question her love for him and she'll stop being reduced to tears."
"I love him, but everything you're saying is ringing true. It's exactly why I don't feel good about the whole situation, because he clearly doesn't care. He KNOWS it bothers me, he does it still, intentionally, and then yells at me (at about 4am mind you) that I am being rude and unreasonable for not showing him my phone. Like, why does he even need to know the time? And why does he insist to know it even at my discomfort, which I have expressed to him multiple times and even offered a perfectly reasonable solution for? It's been 3 damn years and I can't believe THIS is the incident that's making me realize maybe he's not the one. "
"This engagement needs to last for a **long** time. You need to make sure he's done being a mama's boy, and that he's up to being a father for your child. "
"&gt; How do I make my brother feel loved and make her understand my brother is cool too? And make the comments stop? 

You're a good sister. However, just because you're on your brother's side won't protect him completely from your mother's comments. Where's your father in all this? What does he think about your mother's behaviour? Have you thought about seeing the school counselor with your brother to talk about your mother?

Your mother wants probably to motivate your brother to eat healthier/do more sports but with her comments she just destroys her son's self-esteem. Each time she starts comparing the two of you, just call her out on it and walk away. "
"Normally I am not big on lying, I make an exception in this case I might have done what your parents did under similar circumstances."
I think instead of saying in the middle of the night she should say left early that night. In the middle of the next sounds like she left really late.  
You sound pretty unreasonable. She agreed to marry you and you refused.
"I mean, I can kind of totally see why she would feel that way. You start off saying that you divorced her because of her appearance. Sure there were other reasons, but that was your number one reason that you listed here. And now, you are dating someone significantly younger. Again, I can see why she would think that way.

Regardless, you cant really do anything to stop her from talking about you behind your back like that except talking to her and just trying to set the record straight to people she may have told. Just dont start spreading your own rumors. I think you really just have to try and let it go."
"You need to tel her how you feel. She may not realise that you don't feel as though you have a voice in the relationship. 

If that doesn't resolve things, then this may not be the right relationship for you in the long term. She might need someone who is more connected to her culture and her industry, and you might need someone who asks you more about what you want from life.

But let's not jump ahead. Your first step is to talk to her and say why you feel like you're not being heard."
"I can't believe no one else is pointing this out-- if it is indeed a '1920s' style dress, then it's probably beaded or embellished. If this is the case, *THE DYE WILL NOT SET EVENLY*. The beads will prevent the dye from settling uniformly &amp; you'll end up with a patchy, ugly, ruined dress. Even a pro dressmaker will not attempt this; call up some in your area &amp; ask them for yourself.

If you don’t believe me, take a scrap of fabric, sew a few strings of beads on there (very simple project, even people who've never picked up a needle can handle this). Then dye it. That's what the whole dress will look like.

u/TwoOranges let's play what if: if you suggest that this chick dye her dress as a compromise, and the dress is ruined as a result, are you prepared to buy her a replacement dress? If not, don't go this route."
"She's bluffing, your parents are legally obligated to care for you until legal majority. A judge isn't going to emancipate you and free her of her responsibilities because your boyfriend is poor. Your father would also have to be in agreement.

Get in touch with him as soon as you can and all him for some family therapy."
"On the flip side, your wife isn't the one forcing you into that corner. Do you seriously not see how absolutely goddamn absurd it is for literally *anyone* to cut you out of their life because you won't allow them to spank your child? And in the interest of full-disclosure, I am generally pro-spanking, and I *still* think that apparently every other person in your life is absolutely nuts. "
That part bugged the hell of out me. OP's ex was a complete parasite--she clearly contributed nothing to the relationship. I'm glad OP realized it before the baby was born. 
My friend had something similar happen when she was 18 and she just told the website she was 17 in the pictures and they were immediately taken down without asking her for proof.  I think it's completely fine to lie to websites like that to get pictures taken down.  Did you ever try saying you were a minor?
Hormonal birth control is a big deal for women. There are other methods that you can use in combination with condoms to minimize your risk. 
"It's fair for her to be upset. It's fair for her to want to get married. It's fair for you to be upset. It's fair for you to not want to get married. What isn't fair is that she entered into a relationship with you thinking she'd get her marriage and now you changed your mind recently and she's being pushy. It would be absolutely fair for her to want to leave you over this, because you previously promised her a future that you are now saying isn't going to happen.

I understand the reasons you have to not want to get married, trust me, I do. But with this, I also understand the reasons your girlfriend sees for wanting to get married:
 
 * It's a traditional thing that many people want just for the symbolic thing.
 
 * It binds you together legally so that if something medically happened to one another or you wanted to share financials or something, she's there.

 * She might see you not wanting to marry her as that you don't trust her to be binded legally, that you're planning on leaving her in the future, etc.

You even kinda suggest this.

I would be a little pissed after spending 7 years with a boyfriend just to have him go ""Gee ya never know what the future holds! I mean I don't like the idea that if things go sour I'll feel tied down to you. I also think you're great now but hey I might completely change one day and want someone else instead or want a new job entirely."" I mean are you kidding me? 

She's absolutely entitled to be pissed due to your lack of commitment and honestly it would be fully reasonable of her to leave you. She's not the one who changed, you did. And that's all fine and good, but you have to be willing to accept the consequences of that change: losing your gf because you don't want to commit because of the off-chance that in the future you'll fall out of love or want to be with someone else. Like, what? If my SO said that to me I'd be so hurt and upset."
"You listed all the things you know help, and then made excuses for why you can't/don't want to keep trying them.

If you really want to fix this, the only one who can help if you. Try cognitive behavioral therapy, try exercising every day, try writing to your husband. But there is no magic fix."
"Rachel is weak.

Go hug your mom and tell her how amazing she is.  Even if Rachel stands up for her family to come to the wedding...the damage is done.  Your mom's heart is breaking...treat this like a bleeding wound and provide emergency care."
"I think you hit the nail on the head about most everything being tied into the business. I don't know how many people he has working for the company, but giving a percentage to all of his kids and grandkids jeopardizes those employees' futures as well."
"I would present it to him this way- both of your fathers are important and deserve to be honored. The baby's name will be Shawn Gregory or Gregory Shawn, his choice. It's a technique that works well with toddlers; hopefully your husband is a little more mature. But if not, could you talk to his father? Your guy seems to think the only way to make his dad feel special is to cut out your dad altogether. I'll bet if you asked your FIL if it would bother him if his grandson also shared your dad's name he'd see no problem with it at all, and might be able to pull your guys head out of his ass."
"If it's your husband's friend, then why hasn't he talked to him? You should encourage your husband to tell his friend how he feels. "
"This is really good and helpful advice, thank you.

Outside of fights over Jack, my parents generally argued about my dad's conduct with other people. He calls himself ""blunt"", mostly everyone else calls him an asshole, if that paints a picture. He has been asked to leave parties, gatherings etc. more than once because of things he's said.

Before Jack was born (when I was eleven), I don't remember my parents fighting nearly as much. I noticed that it slowly grew as time went on though, especially when Jack became a preteen. However, I can't really pinpoint an exact situation when it started becoming a genuine concern, because when I moved out, Jack was only seven. "
"Um you're not being unreasonable. It's completely inappropriate to name your child after someone you're infatuated with. **Someone who isn't even the mother of the child**. How fucking disrespectful. To you and your baby. 

Your husband has issues. And is now forcing this fucked up infatuation on his wife and unborn child. Do NOT compromise and even let it be a middle name. Given the history of the name, it should not be any part of the name of your baby.

It sounds like overall your dad is making progress, so try to focus on that. It sounds like he made a big breakthrough and I'd try to keep it positive and not have him feel the pressure of trying to change everything at once. 

If your dad won't talk with the therapist, maybe you and your sister could go and hopefully get her on the same page. "
"Well it's a red flag but not so much that she sounds like an animal abuser as that she's about as sharp as a pound of wet liver.

"Can we please pause for a moment to appreciate the fact that this is the type of ""prank"" that can get people *fucking shot*?  Holy shit, the lack of judgement in carrying out a ""prank"" like this is so far beyond idiotic that a word doesn't exist for it.  Literally the only mitigating factor is that the person who arranged it knew you and knew you weren't armed or violent or both, but that went out the window as soon as the crowd got involved.  As soon as one touched you while you were surrounded, you would have been clear to use lethal force to defend your life, and the fact that it turned out to be a ""prank"" later wouldn't change that.

Who the fuck is the fucking bouncer and why the fuck is he this stupid, too?  I'd expect a couple of brainless morons who have never dealt with violence to think this was OK, but even a really dumbass bouncer should have recognized the potentially dangerous situation and put the kibash on it beforehand, at least within his sight.  Jesus Christ.  That guy needs to be fucking fired because he's so bad at his job that he puts patrons of the business at risk.  Let him be a fry cook or something where his stupidity only ruins somebody's lunch and not their fucking life."

"The second World War ended when he was still a young man. Lots of people had to do things they weren't proud off, wanted to leave a painful past behind, etc.

Whatever he did, whatever he had to do happened a long long time ago. I think all of you feel hurt for reasons that have very little to do with your grandfathers actions in the last 60 years. You know who he really is and frankly you all getting this upset and butthurt over this is insulting.

"&gt; He left to work early in the morning, just left me some fruits in a plate and a note ""please eat these for lunch"".

Lol. Fuck you. I am healthy and I eat what I enjoy.

"Absolutely fucking not! I can't emphasize enough how fast you should be running in the other direction. 

This man is an abuser of the highest order and you owe him NOTHING. In fact, he is actively manipulating you into giving him a kidney. This is both utterly disgusting and extremely morally reprehensible. 

Cut all contact. Everything. You don't owe him a single second of your time, let alone a piece of your body.

"So let's get this straight... you're avoiding your girlfriend because of something she shouted while in the throes of passion?

How about you communicate with her and ask her? Jesus. Yes it's true she could be lying about not using birth control, or deny it and keep you ""tagged along"", but if you're in a relationship with someone you don't trust to tell you the truth about serious things like this, maybe she isn't the right person for you anyway?"
"Teach your daughter safety tips (from the super ten play it safe rules for kids and grown ups):

* She is the boss of her body.

* Safe Grownups Don’t Ask Kids for Help!! (They go to other grownups if they need assistance).

* Never go ANYWHERE or take ANYTHING from someone she doesn't  know.

* She needs to “CHECK FIRST” with her safe-smarts grownup for permission: before she goes anywhere, changes her plans, or gets into a car even if it’s with someone she knows. If she can’t check first, then the answer is NO!

* Everybody’s bathing suit areas are PRIVATE.

* She doesn't have to be POLITE, if someone makes her feel scared or uncomfortable. It’s okay to say NO… even to a grownup, if she has to.

* Don't keep SECRETS… especially if they make her feel scared or uneasy. (No adult should tell a child to keep a secret).

* She should always pay attention to her Special Inner Voice, especially if she gets an “uh-oh"" feeling.

(The last two are make sure she knows your phone number and address and if she gets lost in a public place, she can freeze and yell or approach a mom with kids for help.)


Edit: I wanted to add to replace 'stranger' with 'tricky person'. 'Safely ever after' has more info and tips. Also, this is in addition to OP protecting herself and her family through other means - it's like teaching fire safety. It's good to have a practiced escape plan and the knowledge of what to do or not do in case of fire, but that doesn't replace prevention or the need to call the fire department."
"Can you really be 100% sure that you didn't take this random picture from years ago? Memory can be pretty unreliable. Maybe you were fiddling around with the camera and accidentally snapped a photo. Or maybe you were pretending to take a picture and didn't realize you'd actually pressed the shutter. Would you remember either incident years later if you didn't even know there was a digital record? Or, if you drink, maybe you'd had a few when you took the photo and in the morning had a fuzzy memory of the night.

The only thing that gives me pause is that your husband jumped right to suggesting that maybe his female friend (who you already had suspicions about) took it while he was changing. That seems like an odd conclusion to jump to if he genuinely has no memory of the photo and has never been in a compromising position with her. But then again some people really suck at hypotheticals, and you know your husband better than us so it's hard to judge.

EDIT: I also wanted to point out that you can take the image into an editing program like Photoshop or GIMP (which is free) and try to play around with the brightness, contrast, and levels -- sometimes this can bring out background details not initially visible. Even a small level of detail might help confirm whether you recognize the location. "
"At this point, it's not really about the income.  They just made me feel.... I don't know.  Disposable I guess."
"I don't know you or her. 

But speaking from experience here this is a hugeeeeee red flag man. 

I'd rip this like a band aid before you get it worse. I had an almost identical situation with a long term gf. 

There's always an excuse and they just get lamer as the months pass. Pretty soon its not just a weird post or picture its a weird friend or a forward co worker.
She'll lie about where shes been and call you controlling and after a while you actually agree with her.

Youll start questioning everything until you realize its crazy and finally open your eyes. 

Then you hate yourself because you lived in denial for months even years when you could have just handled business at the time. 

Im just trying to be real with you. I still to this day have to slap myself when i start looking back.

The best advice i got was from one of my sergeants...flip the script man. Would you do what she did? Would you ask people how theyd fuck you while in a relationship? 

If you feel disrespected and uneasy or something clearly violates your moral compass do not ignore it. Its an incredibly slippery slope. "
"Hi OP. I will be brief. Please utilize a shelter. You could definitely live with your parents, but a shelter has the resources to address the emotional reasons you entered the abusive relationship.

Based on your post, this is not the usual family drama or infidelity that appears on this subreddit. You and your daughter have so much potential to be happy and healthy. However, I doubt anyone besides professionals will be able to direct and guide you on how to rebuild your life.

Again, please escape to a shelter. Please :)"
No. If anything you weren't harsh enough. 
"The other option would be for your parents to discipline all the children equally *without* spanking them. It's not like modern child rearing techniques are a secret. 

Or when your daughter was misbehaving, your parents could have called for you or your wife to handle it. 

So there were a couple alternative ways to resolve this, but the only option your parents saw was for them to get their own way. 

(Even in families that spank, 7 is a little old for it.)

Your parents want to get their way and they are accusing your wife of driving a wedge through the family because she won't give in to their demands. You should stand up to your extended family and stand by your wife. 

&gt; when I was a kid my parents made me go pick my own switch for the kinds of things my sister’s kids get a swat on the butt for.

My dad was raised that way too - *in the 1940s*.

This might be obvious but op don't feel obligated to add this part if you don't, in fact, want to spend time with him. "
I would write his name instead of calling him dad. He lost any right to be called OP's dad long ago.
This man is almost 30 and hiding in showers and shit to facilitate his cheating.  Super loser status.
"OP, your relationship stinks. I'm sorry. But you don't sound happy or fulfilled by your current arrangement, you don't sound like you feel supported, and it doesn't sound like you had any role in making the decision on how your relationship should work.

Your wife is a bully."
"You told them the date, they told you they wouldn't be able to make it, you said you were sorry but you understood.  That should have been the end of it for everyone.  Sure, it would have been nice if they texted you some kind of acknowledgment the day of, but they didn't owe you that any more than you owed them a role in the planning.  Their silence only makes them the center of attention if you let it.  Leave it be and let them reach out whenever they're ready to reach out."
"I think you have a Dad problem as well. He should never have allowed you to stay in the creepy guys flat. 

You don't have to have any contact with her. You don't have to explain why. She's clearly an unreasonable women given how she treated you, so just don't have contact with her. "
"Sometimes when people are really nice and loving in all other areas they are doing the *shadiest* things behind their partners' backs. Subconsciously, it is likely an effort to alleviate their guilt. 

*""I know I cheated, but I am treating her really well to make up for it and look how happy she is. I'm really not so bad.""*

He's probably been doing it all the while. Even if not, deal. breaker."
"Thank you, I will definitely do this. I will pick a few options that are close by and tell him to choose from the selection."
"commenting on this because i think it's a better idea than just shutting off the modem. it'll help OP be safer while looking. I would say to tape something over your phone's camera or set it face down while you look as well, though. 

i clean some houses that have hidden cameras and they look like air fresheners. but they can look like basically anything. it's easy to find hidden cameras when dusting a house, so be thorough like that. top to bottom. dusting could honestly also be a good cover to look without arising suspicion. 

also this situation does sound unsafe and scary. someone that controlling could end up being volatile. i second comments that OP should tell someone else about what's going on. but again, use a friends phone and do it not in the home. "

"Your boyfriend sounds like one of those guys who fetishize red hair. And considering you haven't been together for a long time yet and he's being a huge jerk about what you want to do with your own body, I agree with everyone and say he's not worth it-- and have fun with your new short hair! What a great cause."
"&gt; At first I think he just hasn’t showered and that’s why. So I keep going. 

Bruh. Gross.

Aside from that, ask him why his penis tasted funny. Just outright ask. Tell him, in no uncertain terms, that you went down on him and it was a [adjectives] taste along with [more adjectives] smell and you want to know why. Just be straight up and calm. If he is defensive or dodgy, your trust is gone and that is the type of things that kill relationships. If he's honest and has a reason or is genuinely perplexed, then it seems no worries.

Additionally, you could just ask him how the party went or be full honest. The important thing here is that you trust him, and if you don't then whether he cheated or not essentially doesn't matter because that marks the end of a relationship generally regardless. "
"Honestly Olivia did basically cause someone's death.  Obviously she still needs your emotional support and DEFINITELY needs therapy, but suggesting this reduces her responsibility is simply false:

&gt; she should have been more responsible in doing so, but for Christ’s sake it’s not like this was her intention. 

You are enabling your sister.  The rule about not having parties or swimming at the house - or indeed doing anything as dangerous as boating while drunk at night, is BECAUSE of risks like this.  Your sister lied, disobeyed and the consequences were absolutely forseeable.  If I wave a loaded gun at your head and it goes off and you die I am still guilty of homicide, even if I didnt intend to shoot you.

If your husband his raising his hand to you and emotionally blackmailing you then he is abusive.
"Right? This was my favorite part:

"&gt;He has been dropping hints lately that he not only wants me to start cooking meat, he wants me to start eating it.

Previously, I was just going to say that he needs to be the one to handle his family, but it sounds like he agrees with them.  

Wow, I just saw your ages.  I thought you guys were like in your 20s.  Uh, no.  He's a grown-ass 41 yo man who can't accept your lifestyle.   If he doesn't cut that crap out and start defending you to his family, for me, that would be a deal-breaker.  You shouldn't have to justify or defend your lifestyle to him.  I say get out of this relationship before he starts trying to force-feed you chicken.  

Also, just curious, as I am a non-vegetarian, why are you okay with dating someone who eats meat, but you are so careful about what soaps you use?  I don't mean to sound judgemental.  I just would think that your partner being ""cruelty free"" would be more important than your household products.  "
"&gt;Sometimes, I wish I wasn't so sensitive to people's changing moods. I'm kind of a classic introvert, so I can read people pretty well and I work their behavior over and over again in my head. If I was a little more clueless I could have let this entire two months pass me by without worry.

Noting changed moods is a really good quality to have! *Taking it personally* is where you'll run into problems. "
"That's what really stood out to me as well. Like not ""she's helping them with homework"" or ""she's got them interested in playing a sport""'... Clearly his obsession with appearances is having a negative influence on his children and I would be upset if I was the ex wife too! "
This is like the Darwin Award of relationships. I give it 2 weeks before you're laughing your ass off over this.
"Your kid is ten. That is plenty old enough to internalize the shit your sister says and beat himself up over it. 

Tell your parents that, for the sake of your son, you are cutting contact with your sister and her family (because there's no way to see the cousins without some contact with your sister.) Express to them that clearly she has some problems or issue, and she needs to get help, and until she does so you must protect your son. 

A couple of sessions with a therapist wouldn't hurt for your son, just to make sure he's not internalizing any of the crap your sister has spouted for the last ten years. 

I know it sucks, at any age, to disappoint your parents, but you have to put your son first. It's simply not healthy for him to be in any contact with her. "
"I don't really have advice, but I can absolutely offer sympathy. I had a best friend from college who refused to leave an abusive bf (after college). Her entire group of friends tried our hardest to be supportive and encourage her to get out of the relationship, but she ended up just lashing out at us and alienating everyone she knew over it. We stood by her for a long time, but after so many times of her going back to him, we eventually gave up. 

As friends, there is only so much you can take. I'm a guy, and her asshole bf was constantly trying to fight me because he saw me as some kind of threat. Eventually, I realized there wasn't any relationship with my friend that was worth salvaging. She eventually got away from that guy, but the damage she inflicted on her own group of friends never really healed.

Sucks, but that's life sometimes. Internet hug, yo. "
"Adorable. As long as you proceed with caution I see no reason not to explore this. Just make sure you have a backup plan if living with him gets complicated. 

And HIGH FIVE YOUR PERCEPTIVE SISTER. It sounds like she's really looking out for you."
"Talk to a lawyer immediately. And a therapist is an excellent idea. Not only will the children have resentment towards their father, they'll also likely have an enormous amount of resentment towards you for forcing them to continue in this situation as long as you have. "
"dingdingding!!!

I'm glad whoever intervened there had good sense, because when I got to that part of the update I was *appalled*. Even reading OP's original post gave me the gross goosebumps. I can't believe the supervisor literally just laughed it off.

Either way, seems like it's being handled properly now, so glad. And also so glad things didn't escalate even farther in the scenario from OP's first post."
"You want to know what to do?   Not a God damn thing.  Dont talk to Gary, his wife, any other 'friends or family' or anyone.   Seriously just cut them all out of your life.   I get you feel 'responsible' but this is way beyond you.  There is plenty of other shit going on that you are not aware of, and you are just being used as the excuse.  

Please understand you cannot fix this, and there is nothing you can do to absolve you, him or reason with his wife.    Let him handle it and if things fall apart, its on them.   

You are blaming yourself with your 'uhmm' response.   If a random stranger called you asking something random like ""how you felt about the sky being green'. . . 'ummm'  WTF are you talking about?   Look at it that way and you are not bad in high pressure sitautions, you were just caught off guard with weird off the wall random crazy talk.   
Edit: sp"
"Hi OP! This is separate from the spanking issue, but I would just like to say as someone who 100% gets along with my future MIL that I still would not want her in the delivery room as I gave birth. It is very different to have your mom who raised you in the room with you during a painful and vulnerable and terrifying time versus someone you did not meet and form a relationship with until your 20s. And imagine having someone who you know didn't even like you there as you pushed a baby into the world through your vagina?!

The getting ready for the wedding thing is also a bit different, because it's not traditional for the MIL to get ready with the bride. It's completely traditional and normal for a woman's mom to be there and help her daughter get dressed.

I wish you the best of luck resolving this, but your mom seems to expect that she will be a ""second mom"" or even a ""more important mom"" to your wife, and that is not fair to the woman who raised her. "
"Each parent gets to veto a child's name.  We divided up the kids so hubby mostly named the boy and I mostly named the girl but we each still shot down lots of names.  I actually said no to one name because it sounded like a superhero.  You don't have to justify your no...it is just a flat no.  It doesn't matter if your feelings are unfounded you are the mom and you say no.

The bigger problem to me...is your husband's not listening to his partner.  You may want to address that before you are both sleep deprived."
"&gt;I know I'm making it sound like she's this horrible, evil woman. 

Uhm, not really? I'm struggling to see what she has actually done wrong here. Seems like she's been pretty open about whats happening, doing her best to fit you into her life, etc. And you're just...sitting around being bitter about her doing things that you haven't even told her you have a problem with. 

You need to be more open with her, and actually discuss your issues with her. You've always known that she was pursuing acting, it's a bit rich to turn around and have an issue with kissing and sex scenes, that's what the industry is going to involve sometimes. Have you spoken to her about wanting to see your parents? 

I don't really understand how you were living in this other country for a year, and haven't learnt the language or culture? "
"The trouble with taking secrets to the grave is that if you don't plan on dying any time soon, there are a lot of opportunities between then and now for stuff to get unearthed.  If your partner is going to be even the slightest bit upset about it, the fallout is *always* much, much worse when they find out after it's ""too late.""  And even if you're right and there's no way he could ever find out, do you really want the question of ""but what if he did?"" hanging over you for the rest of your lives together?"
"&gt; I can either leave Tim all together, which would crush his heart, and go to Brandon, or I can cheat on Tim with Brandon, which is a horrible fucking thing to do.

Or, y'know, you could *stop hanging out with Brandon*.  The fact that isn't even an option for you should tell you this is already an affair; it just hasn't gotten physical yet.  And if you do care about and respect Tim, even if you no longer wanted to be married to him, you should do him the courtesy of being honest about that so the two of you can start figuring out how to end the marriage amicably.  Because oh-so-courteously informing him every time you go off with the guy you really want to be with?  *That's* a horrible fucking thing to do."
"You need to put your son and yourself first. Tell your parents you cannot have such a toxic presence in your life. Your sister is scum and you should be so proud of what you have achieved. It's up to her to make it right with you (if that's even possible) not for you to put up with. You have paid your parents back and so feel no guilt about setting your boundaries with your sister. Can you get together with your parents only? If you are still struggling to put your foot down think of your son, time will come when the comments your sister makes will hurt him. You need to be strong enough for his sake to shield him from her. "
"She's only 20 - her life hasn't really 'turned out' yet, so to speak.   She's still got a life time to live.   

You did the right thing praising her for getting her life together and how far she's come over the past few years.   Those are things you and she should both be proud of.

Doubts and concerns about our kids and how they're doing in life are normal,  and having them doesn't in any way make you a bad mother.   I personally think it would be more hurtful than helpful to discuss your worries with her - she can't change the past,  but it sounds like is changing her present and working towards a better future."
Why won't your mom do anything? Does your sister run the house?
"What the hell is going on that these kids need to spanked all the time anyway!?  

Also, you sound like a jerk.  Your wife didn't *insist* you live near her family.  She moved to be close to her mother who has PARKINSON'S disease.  That's a big fucking deal.  She didn't do it to spite you.  Or you parents.  But at least your parents get to whine about being ""devastated"" while your wife watches her own mother deteriorate before her very eyes.  So that's cool!

Your parents are jerks and they are weirdly obsessed with discipline which is fucking crazy.  **Stop letting people hit your kid.** I can't even believe that has to be said!!??"

However, you can't make an adult do anything.  She has an untreated mental illness that your ""great"" dad is just enabling.

"&gt; While some dementias can get better (like if they're from a UTI)

"I'm a social worker that focuses on an over 55 population. Unfortunately, your scenario is very common.  Becoming a caregiver, even when someone wants to be one, is very challenging and emotionally taxing.  This situation is not fair to you, your husband, nor his mother.
I'd recommend having an in depth conversation with your husband about his plans and feelings regarding his mom's care.  Bringing up things like: what is he looking for in a long term care facility?  Is he overwhelmed with the process of finding a place and needs guidance? Is he feeling any guilt about the prospect of having her move into a care facility?  Does he need support or education around dementia?
Whatever is bolstering his resistance to moving his mom to a care facility, I would recommend counseling to address the issues this will bring up in the relationship and to work toward a realistic plan which works for both of you. After that, I would recommend looking into local Elder Service programs, Home Care programs, PACE programs, and Adult Day Health Centers.  These resources will provide services to help to ease some of the stress of having his mom in your home; some can also provide some guidance about long term care placement.
If you're willing, make some appointments to visit some local facilities and go together for a tour.  This will, ideally, join you both with a common purpose and keep the conversation ongoing and transparent."

"Dude. You are 25 years old, why should you parents have to tell you what to do?  Vacuum the kitchen and family room.  Tell them to go watch TV when they start doing the dishes. It sounds like they just want you to help out beyond simply taking care of yourself.  They probably feel unappreciated for the enormous favor they've been giving you for years, so grow up a little and do more.  "
Well that's terrifying
"Nope.  I think you have underreacted so far.  You don't have to explain why you broke up with him, and his current behavior is moving into stalker-ish territory.

Right now you have an opportunity to ensure they feel loved and secure through this, I suggest we all make the best of it""."
"Absolutely. CPS loves keeping family together, even at a fault sometime. With your parents so eager to give up their rights and having clearly broken the law, there's not really much issue that he'll be forced to go back with them. If they try, he's at the point where emancipation is a work-around so that he can just really be free from them and stay with you by choice. I doubt anyone would deny him emancipation after the abandonment. Again, you have many great options after contacting CPS that they will help you work through, it is extremely highly unlikely your brother will be sent to live with anyone else, including your parents. 

But don't take my word for it, take theirs. And the free lawyer consultations too! CPS is looking out for your brother mainly, you need someone to look out for your best interests too and while CPS will, if they think you might struggle too much then he could go to an aunt or a cousin with more resources to take care of him. Again, emancipation is another great road he can go down in this instance. But I think you have a good case on y'alls side.  "
"Yeah, completely valid, but I forgot to add in the post that she is actually named because of the exact same reason, seems really strange to me. "
I don't know. He is a strange man. I suspect (based on the things he said) it was so that they know very well in advance that they're not getting anything so they can plan accordingly and not to have expectations.
"**UPDATE:** I called the police and two officer men came. They talked to my sis and I but were extremely unhelpful and seemed to be on his side? They kept saying ""there's nothing we can do"" because he didn't actually get any naked footage. I had to beg them to search the house and they did a cursory search. They took my roommate away in handcuffs to freak him out but he knows his rights and he seemed very calm. I hung around the room they were ""questioning"" him in (he invoked his rights so they couldn't do anything) and could hear them joking around and laughing together. I filmed most of their convo from a side room (the officer kept asking me to leave upstairs too, which it's my house so I have the right to be wherever) but I don't know how clear the footage is.


The officer says he could be back in the house as early as 3 hours from now. I'm at my wits end. Can I file a complaint about how unhelpful the officers are? Would that do anything? They basically said there's nothing I can do and I have to pack a bag and get out of here in three hours. I feel so helpless. Please help, and thank you everyone so much for all your comments and help so far."
"I see below that he also refuses to replace the phone he broke a year ago and insists on using yours (including in this disrespectful way of waking you up).

Are there other instances in your relationship where he disregards you, your feelings or your stuff in order to satisfy what he wants, be lazy, or take advantage?  This speaks to an underlying feeling that he believes his wants and desires are more important than yours."
"What's worse: dying alone, or dying with someone whose response to being told that they're making a terrible situation even worse is to decide they know what you need better than you do?  

Remind your girlfriend she's your girlfriend, not your speech therapist or translator.  Be clear with her that the corrections need to stop, permanently.  You need her support, not her constantly reminding you of what you're losing under the guise of being ""helpful.""  If she can't do that, then let her go and focus on finding people who will be there for you, even if you need to talk to your doctor about hospice resources and support groups."
"&gt; They all seem pretty indifferent on all this

They are so used to your wife's crazy behavior, that they are okay with getting pulled out of school for days at a time, just because your wife can't handle an argument. She is not a good influence on those kids."
"I cannot imagine how confused your daughter is (or your not-daughter). A guy raised her for a decade and then all the sudden he and her mom are like, ""NOPE! Not your dad anymore! Peace out, sucka."" These are some of the toughest years of a young girl's life (middle school sucks), and to have a parent abandon you makes those tough years a million times worse. 

I also cannot imagine how hurt you feel to find out that she is not biologically yours. But you raised her for her entire life. You ARE her father. Genetics is not the only defining part of parenthood. You were the guy who was there for every skinned knee, who was there every time she woke up with a nightmare. You taught her to ride a bike. You helped her with her homework. 

You may not share DNA, but you are Bella's father. And you are being an awful human by going no contact with your child. 

You should get some serious therapy in order to learn to cope with what you have learned. But for the love of everything good and holy, STOP TAKING IT OUT ON BELLA. "
"If he is cheating on you, dump him.

"Not noticing the things your SO purposely hides from others doesn't make you a bad girlfriend. The way you've supported her after finding out makes you a fantastic girlfriend, though.

When things calm down a little, perhaps you can gently suggest some therapy for your girlfriend so she can start learning to deal with these issues? Not in a judgemental manner, of course - frame it as a tool for her to grow past her abusive family history."

"After a car accident, no less. I realise some people don't handle shock well but that's just cold."
"I want to know if he set the costs of a ring, wedding and honeymoon against the marriage related savings on his spreadsheet. 

""Honey, I love you and I'm absolutely clear on the financial benefits of getting married. But you could have financial benefits by marrying literally anyone. Please, let's get engaged by telling each other why we want to marry each other in particular. It would mean a lot to me if your proposal came from your heart, not your wallet."""
"I have my mum's last name, not my dad's, and it's never been an awkward issue in any situation that I can remember (I don't know about my early childhood, obviously). Like you and your wife, my parents are married and Mum kept her name. Having her name doesn't make me not close to my dad and it definitely doesn't say anything about my parents' relationship or how my mum thinks about my dad. (Although not taking his name definitely affected how Dad's family treated and treats Mum - but I think that's on them, not on her.) 

Of course it's easy to see why you might feel hurt by this, but I wonder if it would help you if you kind of flipped the script on yourself. It's very traditional for kids to take their dad's last name, so it feels to you like you're being rejected (especially since she phrased it as ""Kid can have any name, but not yours""), but maybe instead you could think about it as you guys just realising that that automatic tradition isn't right for you and instead you're doing something different. Like, a lot of guys feel really upset and rejected when female partners don't want to change their name, but it sounds like you've pretty successfully flipped the script on yourself for that to realise that that thing not happening just because it is the traditional thing isn't actually a rejection of *you* any more than guys not changing their names when they get married is a rejection of their partner or children getting their father's name is a rejection of their mother. 

I do have my dad's surname as one of my middle names (and I'm very glad that I do, even though I don't really use my middle names anywhere) and maybe that's something that your wife might be willing to contemplate, if you want to preserve that connection."
"I think he's been sending pretty clear signals that he's concerned about the educator-student line, and I don't think he's sent you any signals at all that he might be interested.


If you want to keep a professional relationship with him in the future - perhaps future letters of recommendations, etc. - then you shouldn't ask him out. 


If you don't care about that, then I guess you could ask him to grab coffee or something and see how he responds. I will say, however, that if he ends up dating a former student, especially one a decade younger than him, it will look weird to his colleagues. I'm not saying it never happens, because it does, but in my experience it usually reflects poorly on the professor who does that. So he's going to be thinking about not only whether or not he wants to date you, but also the potential professional ramifications of that."
"Yes, I haven't received any since I asked her about it. I've stayed up to see if I could catch whoever it was (with my lights off and me not moving, as if I was asleep) but nothing has happened. 

I've told my guy friend about the notes (he was the one who suggested the camera) and also my best friend, who is out of state at the moment. My guy friend jokingly suggested that he should stay over again to ""provoke"" the culprit into sending more notes, haha... "

"Hold up- YOURE the pregnant one and she's demanding YOU wait on HER?! Even if she were the pregnant one these demands would still be absurd, but this is just...I'm speechless.

You guys need counseling immediately, there's no way around it. If she doesn't agree, then you need to think long and hard about your future together. The more you let her get away with this bullshit, the worse it'll get. I'm so sorry you have to deal with this :("
"She sabotaged your birth control. That is batshit crazy, and if it were me, I would never ever speak to that woman again until she offered up a heartfelt apology. Just imagine, if she's willing to tamper with your birth control because she doesn't agree with your choices, imagine what else she's capable of doing.

You are not crazy.

Your mother in law is a batshit, overbearing asshole."
"I stupidly thought you were the guy and she is the wife who is pregnant. that's not the case I see - you're pregnant. umm yeah, you need to get thee to a counselor:

1. your wife is being an asshole to you and causing you a lot of stress when you're pregnant. what. the. fuck?

2. her perspective is 100% wrong. she is stupid for thinking this. I am rarely this harsh on this sub - I realize there are people and feelings at play here. but her view is downright idiotic, I wouldn't trust someone who thinks like this with making all the educational decisions for my child, that's nuts."
"It might not be a popular opinion, but going on a no-contact road trip after a break-up is typically the kind of advice this sub would give. *David never contacted OP to check on her*. *David asked Patrick to delete the texts*. Deleting the email was a logical follow-up that Patrick did to respect the no-contact policy *David wanted*, *David gave his brother his password*. It's totally possible he didn't read the e-mail. 

He might still be an asshole, but David should get half or most of the blame for poorly managing/outsourcing his breakup. He should assume that *HE* chose to go no contact and it came with a price. Comments here seem to make Patrick the evil mastermind of a conspiracy, suggesting he knew all along etc.. when it is most likely David not assuming several bad decisions, making a scapegoat out of his brother to salvage his relationship with his daughter."
"That's actually smart of him.  If he's 77, then his kids are in their 50s.  I bet at least one of those kids was planning on having their Dad's money to help pay for retirement."
"Yeah... it's time to get the building manager involved.  

My guess is she can do a few possible things:

1) You can get out of your lease and find a new apartment.  Odds are they'll be wiling to rip up your contract and refund your deposit if the alternative is dealing with the police showing up on the regular and scaring the other tenants or having to figure out how to make a restraining order work or god forbid some worse scenarios if Kyle is really crazy. 

2) This may prompt an eviction of Kyle.  Maybe they've been wanting to get rid of him for a while as a tenant.  Or maybe this will prompt their efforts to ""encourage"" him to leave.  Tenant laws are different from place to place and depending on where you live, if they want to get rid of Kyle, Kyle may be gotten rid of.

3) She may be able to instal additional locks or other security measures.  Like security cameras to confirm if Kyle really is hanging out outside your apartment door.

4) Even if she can't help in an official capacity, she's a potential ally in your new home.  If she knows what's going on, she'll know to keep an eye out for you and be a witness if things escalate and the police have to get involved.  Her involvement may even be enough to convince Kyle to back the fuck off and leave you alone.  

You need allies.  Letting the building manager know what's going on under her roof is a good start."
"Your parents are not and never will be on your side. It sounds very much like he can do no wrong in their eyes and you will always be expected to take his abuse.

What if they start treating your kids differently, treating one like the golden child who can do no wrong and the other like the scapegoat who needs to lie like a doormat and take abuse?"
"Oh god, these people sound so erratic. They go from pressuring you for an abortion to proposing marriage at 8 months in all in the span of a few weeks.

I'm certainly not advocating you spy on him, because the mountain of disrespectful behavior from him and her is enough grounds for divorce in my opinion."
"Ask them if they would've made the same decisión if you found out that you were simply unable to have kids for some medical reason.

"Yeahhh, we drive an S Max.  In the context of our ""now"" (3 smallish kids, 2 have special needs) it is my ""dream car"" because it's big enough to cart all the crap my family needs around and it's got parking sensors.

However, if my husband came home with a brand new R8, or even a TT just for him i'd be pretty pissed off because that's a dream car that's about his desire as an individual to have a fast sexy car, NOT his desire as a father/husband to have a vehicle that gets the job done well.  It is my ""dream"" to not have to try to cram the ridiculously huge and hard to fold wheelchair-pram into the back of a TT, ergo an SUV is a ""parent's"" dream car.  But your sports car isn't about being a parent, dealing with life as it is today or anything else to do with reality.  You just wanted a fast sporty car, for you to enjoy.

Maybe she would like to NOT just feel like mom sometimes, zipping about in a sexy sports car?  I don't know how you divide the work in your household but my husband earns while i care for the kids (and save us a ton because special needs childcare is either nonexistant or ££££).  When you have a toddler to chase AND a pretty small infant to feed and change and care for, i mean, that's hard frustrating work! 

I mean, WHY did you buy your dream car?  Because you are feeling stifled, bored, maybe frustrated with the reality of life with very small children to care for and how limiting that is?  Maybe because you wanted a little injection of fun and pleasure and honouring JUST YOU in your life?  Imagine she feels the same, and the sporty car is a nice little yeehaa for her too."

"&gt;I tried to explain myself, but the whole ride home i was shushed so they could yell at me, and cry and be unreasonably hysterical

Well first up, no matter what else is going on, it's pretty hard to ""explain away"" a heroin addiction. And let's be honest here, heroin isn't a wee toke of a joint when you get home from work, as addictions go this is the big leagues, so I would debate that yelling and crying aren't a terribly unreasonable response from distraught parents. This is the problem with addiction though, you think you're handling it coz you haven't done xyz yet (I still have a job / I'm not living on the streets / I haven't gotten desperate enough to turn tricks yet) but it seeps into *every* corner of your life. Your relationship with your sister may never be the same again and your addiction is partially at fault. Go to rehab, go to NA, get yourself a sponsor and clean up your act. Repeat all the silly affirmations and make new friends and start jogging or something to keep yourself busy. Show your parents you can be trusted and maybe they'll listen to you next time. But keep using and you won't just have thrown away your chance to help her, but you'll be throwing that chance away each and every time you use."

"I'm very sorry to hear your family is going through such an upheaval. It is no doubt extremely difficult to be separated from your children and to have those poor relationships affect your relationship with your husband. I have a few points.

1. Couples counseling with your husband isn't meant to diagnose any possible mental illness your daughter suffers. She's not even in the room. The counseling is meant to be a forum in which you can communicate (honestly, fairly) with your spouse about the various issues you're facing and reach some sort of compromise or decision about how to move forward (or IF to move forward) in your relationship. It can also be a way to learn more healthy behaviors for interacting with your children and how to have some sort of relationship with them, if they want one.

2. You mention your sisters are also estranged from their children. That suggests some very unhealthy family dynamics between your generation and your kids' generation. Have you considered something IS a problem with your behavior as a parent -- maybe learned from YOUR parents -- that is affecting your children so negatively?

3. Kids are overwhelmingly loyal to loving parents, even when they fight. When both your son and daughter disappear like that and cut off contact, something is VERY VERY VERY wrong. And common sense would lead me to believe the problem is not with them but with you. This letter your daughter wrote that you dismiss out of hand.... What does it say? Does she accuse you of some sort of abuse? I bet she does.

4. I don't blame your husband for seeking counseling. A licensed family therapist is trained to deal with situations like yours. If you value your marriage and trying to recreate something like a stable family I urge you to keep going back and to LISTEN to the therapist. 5 minutes and a terse exchange is not giving counseling a meaningful chance.

5. You're actually considering getting your daughter committed? On what grounds? Is she a danger to herself or others? Does she have a DIAGNOSED history of mental illness that cannot be treated through outpatient care, therapy and meds? I doubt it.

You've listed a bunch of unexplained assertions that your daughter is lying, wrecking everything, ruining your life, abandoning you, taking from you -- but you provide no details regarding what she is saying that is so untruthful or hurtful. In short, I do not believe you are any sort of innocent party here. Adult kids don't scream to be away from their parents like that unless really bad stuff has happened. If your daughter doesn't want to see you, she doesn't want to see you. If your son doesn't want to see you, he doesn't want to see you. I wonder what you did to bring about that situation. And I wonder what your husband was a party to, or a bystander to, that he now is threatened with the same estrangement. You need to take a good long look in the mirror and start being honest about what events have transpired that have led to this devastating family situation."

"Actually, OP's husband CAN get into a lot of trouble for this. Even if there's a contract outlining consent, Doms can and are charged with abuse against the wishes of their subs. Check out /r/BDSMcommunity for more info."
Could you secretly record him to show your sister?
She's enabling her sister now by focusing on the extenuating circumstances surrounding her actions instead of the choices she made and the consequences that her choices led to.
I want to have this baby. That is what would make me the happiest. 
It sounds like both of you are having some sleep behaviors (sleep talking and his sleep sex behaviors). There may be something in your room/bedtime routine that's triggering these for both of you. You may want to look into talking to a sleep therapist to make sure there isn't anything you're both doing to exacerbate these behaviors.

"Talk to the Blind Association and see if you can get some money towards your surgery from them.

As for your parents, if i were you, I'd be telling them not to rely on you to take care of them when they become too incapacitated to take care of themselves.

You could ask r/techsupport for some advice. They'd probably help you. "
Your sister doesn't need to change her behaviour. Your friend and you will get more close over time. Maybe he is generally lonely and wishes someone understood him so well. Or maybe it's really that he wants to cuddle with you. How would you feel about that? Forget for a moment if other people would think it's weird. 
"Oh my god, I'm so glad she's okay!

"We have talked about getting married but I wanted to wait a bit longer, but that's why she assumes we will get married eventually. I agree that her maiden name should always mean something to her so I don't see what the big deal is with having those initials in the thing. "
"Yes that is one of the things I think about. When she was little little we could pick some of the little flowers that sprout up inbetween the cracks in the walk way. One morning she picked some and held them all day in her hand whilst we did other things, she was holding them to give to her dad. And would refuse anytime I attempted to coax them from her. She was determined to give him those flowers. She waited all day, ended up falling asleep way past dark with those flowers still in her hand cause he wouldn't come home from a parties.


I think about that experience from time to time. I want her to find someone really good, someone that will bring her flowers and not ever having to watch her baby wait for someone that isn't coming. Your point is right about this, thank you.


I think I'm able to move back home to my parents and can by pass a shelter, I feel bad if I were to use that when I have another option, some women don't have any. 


Thank you for taking the time to reply to me. I can't express really how comforting feels when I'm use to feeling so isolated. "
"I like this idea. I don't know why I didn't think about it. I am in school for social work and they always talk about the power of writing letter haha.

You should have went no contact, but I think you're getting off on the whole ""White Knight"" syndrome too much to actually follow through with that.  
All in all this is probably providing her (in her own head) with ways to further validate and justify what she did, hence enabling her to do it again. ""He obviously understands why I did it, so it can't have been completely wrong, otherwise why would he still be talking to me, maybe he wants me back, I guess I'll make it seem like I've changed"" etc.

"&gt; Grandparents have taken a initiative that could make them never see their grandkid again, just because it could save his life

I see this as a pretty selfless thing for the grandparents to do, actually. Even knowing that they might be barred from seeing their grandkid if his parents find out about the vaccinations, they're willing to give up contact in order to potentially save the kid's life. 

I read about a lot of selfish, narcissistic family members here-- anti-vaxx dad and enabler mom are two of them, actually (Dad sacrificing the well-being of his kid to uphold his unsubstantiated beliefs, Mom sacrificing the well-being of her kid to keep the peace in her marriage). Both decisions are motivated by self-serving desires. 

**Grandparents' decision is motivated by a desire to serve the kid.**

I'd keep the secret, knowing that decision is also part of protecting the kid's well-being."

Even if he genuinely thinks the name is pretty, it's still going to be associated with her. If he has any friends from high school/college who knew her, then they are going to talk about it. Is he still friends with her? It might make her super uncomfortable, too.


And again, even if the name were super common, both of you should be agreeing on a name. Even if the name he loved was not associated with anyone, you should be picking a name together. And ""I pick this one, you pick the next,"" is a very bad idea."

"Thanks for your kindness, my brother really is an amazing person. I don't know where I would have been without him.

My knee is around 85% healed or so according to my physical therapist so I'm definitely more than able to do chores. I've been trying as much as I can to clean the dishes, vacuum and other stuff like that.

I don't actually know how to cook very well although Friday nights Lily and I try our best to make them something, since it's our movie night. I've been learning slowly.

I'll look into finding something part-time, although it's a bit of a struggle since I don't have a car to get to and from work."
"OK, so, clearly you made a mistake when you entered a relationship with this guy. He was a predator going after high school girls half his age. You need to divorce immediately and get some therapy for the decade of abuse you suffered through.

"I've never before read a Reddit breakup story and felt so livid for the OP. Nor have I so badly wanted to be able to reach through the screen, choke-slam the assholes (seriously, Kayla, this is for you, Bitch.) and hug the cheated-on individual.

"Oh boy.. I went through this back when I volunteered. The stress from this is why I don't volunteer any more. In my case the person took over $20,000 and eventually ended up going to jail. Some thoughts: 

1) you are now the leader. 
2) to protect yourself you should call the police immediately. Given enough time, she could try and spin this. It won't work, but it will cause endless stress and inconvenience for you if she does.
3) get the bank account changed. Even if that means setting up a new one for the troop. Talk to the bank about how to set the account so no one person can take money out. Ideally in volunteer organizations you always want there to be two signatures when dealing with money. 
4) talk to the parents. This will get you out ahead of any spin that she is weaving. 

Seriously.. Call the police. Today."
I also wondered about if she leaves her laptop open...he could have set up remote access and be activating the camera/mic there as well.
Yeah.  It's like she's property and doesn't get to make the call for herself.  I wouldn't want to sign up for a lifetime of that if I was her.
"&gt; I see Nine once a week when she comes over for dinner with the kids while my sister works. Sometimes she stays the weekend if I am free.

This is actually a lot of contact with a nephew or niece.

&gt; But there are so many great people, with more resources, to help her daughter before me.

&gt; I just am not sure why it has to be me and no one else, especially when Nine is closer to a lot of them.

Are these people really have as much contact with Nine as you are? I mean, obviously you live with Eve and Fred so you see them everyday, but Nine is clearly an important part of your life. Why do you think your sister asked you instead of these other people? There must be a reason, right?

From my perspective, you essentially are raising two kids with your life partner CeeCee. It's basically a little nuclear family. And it's pretty typical to ask a sibling who's raising kids to take your kids too if you died in a freak accident.

Adding one more kid to this family if your sister died would of course be a big deal, but it's not as though you aren't raising children already. You seem to think that raising Eve and Fred relieves you of any responsibility to your sister, when in fact I see it as the exact opposite.

&gt; Zena told my Mom that I favor Fred and Eve more than Nine and she is hurt CeeCee is my 'true sister' not her.

Well, this is true, isn't it?

&gt; So how can I help my sister understand this and explain it to her?

Well, I don't think you can. I think this is going to be a wedge between the two of you that will never go away."

I'm wondering if I should message her? I have no idea what to even say. Or if I should let it go and do the ol' slow fade?"
"&gt; I agree. But I'm being stonewalled.

You're pregnant, and you pay the bills. She has no leverage or authority to stonewall. 

You are letting her do this.

I repeat, YOU are letting her do this.  What's your excuse for letting her do this? It doesn't matter. For your good, for your child's best interest, you need to stop it from happening. It's about more than yourself now.

This may mean counseling, or it may mean divorce. Make it mean your child grows up in a healthy environment without a bully in one of the most important positions of authority in their life."

"I work in IT, I know how to log router activity, install key loggers and track phone usage.  I've also worked with small cameras (the lens is the size of a pin head, the computer itself is the size of a credit card.  You can buy them online for $50 and set them up yourself in an hour).

I can help, but you should really PM me from a burner account created at a computer at a public library.  Your current Reddit account (in fact, all of your accounts; email, banking, social media - everything) has been compromised.  Create a new email account, then create the new reddit account using that email as its contact.  

Yes.  You should be worried.

"1. Getting angry because she thought you cheated. Impulsive, but fair.
2. Hitting your sister. Fuck NO.
3. Refusing to apologize. Unbelievably narcissistic.

Make sure to talk with your boyfriend about how to handle his mother. She looks like a great piece of work, not someone I'd want as my MIL."
"I know. This guy lied to his wife and has been having private wank sessions with his buddy. I don't know if this cheating, but it sure as he'll isn't being honest or respectful toward OP. Add on the fact that this apparently grounds for divorce for the other couple. If this guy's friend was a woman these comments would be very different. Even if they aren't fucking they are sharing a sexual experience, have been doing so for years, and have been doing it behind their wives' backs.

I would be really uncomfortable if my husband did this, and I would demand he stop. The friend can find somewhere else to masturbate."
"Logged in to my throwaway for this comment. My boyfriend and I are in a dom/sub relationship and we very carefully looked through our state's laws about it.

In some states, it doesn't matter whether or not you consented, the dominant partner can still get charged with domestic abuse for a BDSM scene. It doesn't matter or not it was consensual – it's a huge problem where the ""dom"" can be slammed with abuse charges even if the ""sub"" does not want to file them (or is even outright against them).

OP, you need to look up the legality of BDSM in your state. Hopefully, you're in one of the states that has laws that lean in your favor. I cannot stress this enough. I don't say this to scare you, but to make you aware. I strongly recommend going through any law in your state pertaining to this situation. PM me if you need any help."
"&gt;When she gave birth to our daughter, she wouldn't let my mom be in the delivery room, even though her mom got to be there.

Because her mom is *her mom*. If you are having a medical event and want your mom there, that is your right, because she is *your mom*. Your mom doesn't get to see your wife push a baby out of her vagina just because she feels entitled to it. "

"&gt;(I take cheating turbo seriously)

Apparently you don't.

And while being a cheater is a problem for people it's a problem that they can easily fix (by not cheating). Or he could have looked for help before cheating.

He has been exposing you to STDs all this time. And has been spending his money on it. Depending on if you really believe this was the first time. 

What is his excuse, that he's a sex addict? That is an actual condition but sex addicts are you know, actual addicts, they can't really hide it that well. 

If however he just wants sex and has no qualms with cheating. That's not a condition he needs help with. That's him being a cheater."
"It's definitely possible that he bought it for himself. Since he's told you in the past that he's not into anal, and hasn't taken steps to spice up your sex life, he could be embarrassed to admit that it's now something he wants to try again. However, the combination of the secret dick pics and the anal kit makes the situation look pretty bad. It's definitely time for a serious discussion in which you sit him down and ask him to be honest with you about what's going on, and what he wants. From an outside perspective, it sounds like, at the very least, he might be getting his sexual needs fulfilled in a way that doesn't involve you. "
"They are called emergencies for a reason.  As a father of a daughter, I would rather be woken up to help her, than to know she suffered and worried while I slept.  I think you have more than enough reason to give him a late night call."
"Yeah, not your problem to solve. That she's upset is on her, not on you. You did absolutely nothing wrong, she's likely just embarrassed at the coincidence and lashing out defensively because she doesn't know how to take it--like with a sense of humor, for example.

Keep on with your life and let her do her own thing, she's just making herself look foolish and she'll likely realize it eventually and come around. "
"Given this:

&gt;She's made it clear if she gets pregnant she won't get an abortion

I think you are perfectly justified in not having PIV sex until you guys have a backup method lined up.

"I think your parents are seeing you enjoy their generosity with no reciprocation.   You point out that you clean your own room and bathroom.  That's the absolute minimum you should be doing.  It doesn't matter if your mom starts doing dishes.  Take the sponge from her and tell her to sit and relax and you'll take care of it.  Vacuum/dust/clean up without being asked.  Saying that your mom takes care of that does not mean you can't do that for her.  You're an adult now, not a kid.   You should know what needs to be done in the house and how to help.  Saying your mom got to if first is a cop out and really lame.  

Having a huge stash of chocolate and also eating your dad's chocolate is rude.  Why can't you buy two bags of chocolate - one for your room and one for the pantry?  You should apologize to your parent and acknowledge verbally that you know they've give you a sweet deal in living/eating there for free and how much you really appreciate it.  Maybe let them know what your timeline is.  WHEN are you going to start looking for houses?  What's the plan for down payment?  Do you know what areas you're going to look in?  Because right now they have no idea when you're leaving or if you're just going to keep enjoying this free ride."

"Overreacting. She seems fine. This mighta been one of those ""Girl time"" things. She told you about it.

Tinder is a hookup app. She's looking to hook up. If you want a serious and exclusive relationship you'll have to look elsewhere 
"I would recommend couple's counseling and perhaps a parenting class. I think it's wrong if her to say you can't be alone with one of your children. I fondly remember ""daddy-daughter days"" when I was growing up. It seems there is something deeper at play here, like perhaps her identity is so wrapped up with being a mom that she can't let go. Maybe talking to a couple's counselor would help her."
"Date someone better.

Maybe say how proud you are of her stance and ask for the money back so you can use it for your future wedding. See how long her principles stand when money comes into the picture.
"Wow, no, this lady sounds super crazy. Saying NFS isn't misogynistic. And the acronym NFS isn't even exclusive to the scientific field.

The fact that she's chasing you around work even after you explained that you had no such intentions is going to reflect very badly on her."
"I got you. This is how you handle this bro...You literally don't say anything. Just don't make a big deal of it and it wont be. If, at that point, the family *wants* to make a big deal of it just put on your best ""confused"" face and act like you don't understand why they have their panties in a bunch. PLAY DUMB! 

Just pretend that it's such a non-issue that the family would actually have to embarrass themselves to even think of bringing it up to you. If they ask a question, just be so oblivious that the ""oblivious-ness"" actually just points out how they are making a big deal out of nothing. 

I do this all the time when my family members start saying racist shit, and it works like a charm. I'll give you an example of how I would use it, maybe do something like this if it comes up OK? 

Annoyed sister: ""Oh, you got (insert girlfriends name) first class tickets? How special for her...""

You (with fake obliviousness) ""Yeah, I thought so too. I thought it was a nice treat.""

Annoyed Sister: ""Oh, yeah well, did you think maybe the bride should be the one who's getting the nice treat?""

You (very important that you act confused here): ""What do you mean?""

Annoyed Sister: ""Why does she get first class? I'm the bride!""

You: ""What do you mean? I bought her the tickets, not you? Were you expecting first class?"" (really play up the innocence when you ask that. If you do it right you will guilt trip the shit out of her)

Annoyed Sister (slightly embarrassed): ""No, I wasn't expecting it, but...well...never mind""

You: ""Oh, OK...huh"" *Shrugh, then finish putting your bags away*

Seriously OP. Just make it a non-issue. Then, if they make it an issue, pretend you don't understand what the issue is and guilt trip the shit out of them and embarrasses them by making them point out how silly and immature their argument is.

They might talk about you behind your back, but if all goes well they should have enough social tact to abort the conversation once they realize how stupid the issue is, and how immature they would look if they tried making a big deal out of something that you, are pretending, isn't a big deal.

This guy isn't going to *become* an alcoholic. He *is* an alcoholic. He may realize that once he graduates and all of his friends start to cut back on drinking for real life and leave him behind.

My eyebrows literally shot up whe I read that. This takes the crazy in the OP up a whole other level. That his wife goes to visit them or has contact with them AT ALL makes her a saint.

&gt;It's so freaking creepy how adamant they are to spank her like it's some form of a hobby.

Not just them, his sister too, he said in another comment. That whole family is a bundle of crazy. I hope OP realizes this, and if not I hope his wife manages to keep her daughter safe."
"Your parents tried to sue for partial custody?  Do you not see how INSANE that is?? Your parents are crazy. If we could hear your wife's side, I bet your family has done a lot of batshit crazy stuff. 

Edit: If I were your wife, I wouldn't like your mom. Or anyone in your family. You're lucky she's willing to visit after what they have done. 

I'm also curious what kind of advice you were looking for here. Everyone has stated that your wife is right. Either you're being intentionally obtuse, or this is fake. "
"Go to therapy!!!!

Oh, and your relationship is beyond unhealthy.  You need to be single and work on yourself...you are soo vulnerable to everyone."
"Don't cave into this misogynistic view.  His reason about his ""family line"" is bullshit, because he doesn't have the same last name as his parents, *and* you agreed to let the kids have his last name.  The fact that he's saying it's a dealbreaker tells me that this is a control issue for him.  This is not a good way to start a marriage.

Don't give in.  If he sees this as a dealbreaker, then let him go.  Someone that is this controlling is not a good prospect for a long-term relationship.  If he's placing your entire relationship on the line because of *your name*, then he's too selfish to be a good partner to you.  "
"The 3 year olds I work with know which kids in their class can eat peanut butter and which can't.

"What I got out of your update is that your husband would rather make you and the kids homeless than get a new job. And wants to take 0 time to reflect upon what went wrong. His warm lead is a hell of a lot better than most people have and it beats being homeless.

You really need to think about walking away from him... I got the impression that he dislikes female bosses. I'm afraid he might be resentful if you become the breadwinner. At the very least, I could see him staying unemployed, chasing dreams that don't pan out while you bust your ass.
"
"Dude, she knows. She's too scared to admit it. You're the scapegoat because she doesn't want to admit that her husband's a lech. You should start making plans to leave permanently because this situation is getting worse and by being the middle of it you're the one who's going to suffer. And the more they argue over you the more your relationship will be severed. Write a letter to your sister and try to find a friend's place for the night. Tell her you want her to be happy and you do not want to be involved in their private matter and you hope everything turns out for the better. "
"&gt; the all or nothing attitude is completely her

How has this not caused issues until now? This attitude of hers makes any partnership with her absolutely untenable. Not to mention she thinks it's some kind of an ""award"" that she allows you to control your kid's friends and wardrobe???"

"You don't do anything. You act professionally as possible with him tomorrow. He is basically giving you the cold shoulder over your disagreement which is an exceptionally childish way to deal with things.

I wouldn't pack a bag or plan on going. If he comes up to you and acts like nothing happened, you need to sit him down and explain how his actions made you feel and why he felt the need to do this. If it was work, then maybe that's a legitimate reason, but even stressful work situations don't merit a cold shoulder for 3 days.

&gt; Do I take the high road and tell him now that his behaviour is not okay and risk ruining my weekend

So, if you don't engage him and pretend like everything is fine are you actually going to have a nice weekend? If you don't confront him you're basically telling him that he can walk all over you and get away with whatever he wants because you'll just go along with it.

He is very clearly avoiding you."

"Former Security System Tech -

As a lot of others have mentioned, unplugging the modem is good, but most camera systems have recording capabilities. If the internet goes out, it will still be recording, so once he has access again, he'll see video of your snoop attempts. You're gonna wanna power off the main breaker to the house so the camera system loses power as well. That way it won't record. If he has it plugged into a battery backup (UPS), it will more than likely start beeping once it loses power, which may narrow your search if as far as having backup power.

"I think you've correctly identified why she reacted the way she did, but if I was OP it would make me even more concerned than her just being immature or bratty.  They've been dating 2 years, are still pretty young, and he's told her he's not ready for marriage for at least a few more years.  Being upset he didn't put her future initials on it is her saying *I know you've told me you're not ready to commit to marrying me, but I'm going to ignore your feelings about that and expect you to act like we will definitely be getting married in the near future.*

It's insanely presumptuous for someone who is not engaged and whose boyfriend has told her he's not ready to get engaged to her to expect he will start using his last name on personalized gifts for her.  It's the equivalent of him telling her he's not ready to move in together and her responding by having all of her mail delivered to his place.

Either that, or he is just the worst spy the world has ever known. The third option would be that he is just really proud of himself for being so sneaky and has to brag without actually outing himself. "
"Not every relationship decision is a party decision. If you decide to dump someone they don't get a say in the matter. Has nothing to do with treating someone like a human.

Don't put up with the blackmail. Pack your things and move out.

Stay with friends and take care of yourself.
If I may be frank with you, what your sister is doing is abominable and very anti-Islamic. 

I'm really sorry this is happening to you. It can't be easy. When your own values clash with your family's, you're forced to make a difficult choice: either live a lie or compromise.

When my mother found out about me, she disowned me and refused to talk to me for months. I had to distance myself from my family both physically and emotionally. Things have somewhat normalized since then, but I can still sense a bitter anger in my mother, no matter how hard I try to please her. The only thing that brings me comfort is that I no longer feel like a hypocrite and have rid myself of the shame that plagued me for so long.

I wish you the best of luck. Whatever happens, I hope it works out for best &lt;3"

Tell him it's just a trip for you guys and you've worked very hard to take him and simply don't have enough for brother.  Make a compromise and say he can bring back brother a gift or something.

Put your foot down with your ex and say ""NO"" and explain to your son that it's his mom and dad's job to take him on trips, not yours."

"Just to play devil's advocate, the fact that it's a $2000 dollar clothing item means this is the type of piece you expect to keep for many, many years. OP didn't go into it much, but he did make it sound like they have discussed future wedding plans. People are seeing her as a spoiled brat because she is complaining about the expensive gift she received, but maybe *because* of the cost, she saw it as an investment piece that she would have for decades, so the fact that he had it monogrammed with initials that she was expecting to keep for only the next 2 years made this valuable gift seem flippant. I don't know, maybe she is just a spoiled brat who needs to have everything her way no matter the cost, but I think this is certainly one way of looking at it."

"Teacher here with a specialty in high-trauma student populations. I'm proud of your daughter, and here is why.

Your daughter has experienced:

* A violent, unexpected death of a parent at a formative age
* Clinical depression (the same kind that killed her father)
* A highly abusive relationship
* Drug and alcohol abuse (and possible addiction)
* A highly strained relationship with her surviving parent
* Dropping out of school
* Teen pregnancy
* Single parenthood

Your daughter has accomplished:

* Getting clean
* Getting mentally healthy
* Earning her GED
* Becoming gainfully employed
* Raising a sweet, well-adjusted child
* Setting forth plans to further her education

Your daughter is the type of success story I can only dream of for my students. I get that her life hasn't been ideal, but I don't see very many opportunities being closed to her. No, she's not going about it in the ""traditional"" way, but she's 20; she's only a couple years behind her peers, and she has meaningful work and life experience under her belt. By all accounts, she's on track to live a full and meaningful life with a fulfilling career and a family that loves and supports her. I'm not sure, at the end of the day, what more you could ask for.

It's okay to be disappointed that her life hasn't been what you envisioned, but for the love of god, don't tell her that. It's okay to mourn the loss of the dream you had for her, but mourn it quietly and move so you can celebrate what she has overcome, what she has accomplished, and what she will accomplish in the future."
"First things first: do you want to see them?

If not, email back ""Hi dad, I am not interested in discussing the past. There is nothing you could say or do that will change anything and I consider that chapter of my life closed.""

If you want to see them, maybe ""Hi dad, I am open to the idea of seeing you both again, but let me make this clear:  There is no way you can make what happened between us ""right"". The past is done and your overtures of ""making it right"" is too little, too late. I am amenable to moving on and having a relationship with you, but if it's forgiveness you're after, you are unlikely to get it"".

If you meet them - do it somewhere public so you can escape easily and they won't make a scene."
"When I first started reading, I wondered what you were doing to help Aaron interact with Christian. If he had never interacted with a person with autism before, he may have had no idea what to expect or how to interact. Did you explain your brother's skills to him? Did you tell him some of the best ways to engage? While at the party, did you try to facilitate interaction between them? Play a game the three of you, or start a conversation about something that Christian was interested in? If you tried to redirect him to your brother, did he consistently walk away? Or did you just leave him to his own devices to interact and expect him to know what to do? 


If he doesn't care about your family and refuses to see them, he's an ass. Did he meet your parents before? Did he have a good relationship with them?


I think you need to sit down and tell Aaron how important it is to you. Don't ask him if he's uncomfortable. ..he might be embarrassed that he didn't know what to do. Tell him that it is very important to you that he tries to interact with your brother, and be very clear of ways he can do it. Don't just expect him to answer Christian's calls for attention. Make it about the 3 of you and part of bonding with you, by caring about the things you care about.


With direct guidance and support, if he still refuses, then he is being an ass."
Just forget her.
"Tell her you're really freaked out by the idea that someone neither of you is inviting is in your apartment, so you will be reporting it to apartment management and police. Then do it.

"You know it was your husband's mug, not Doug's. Doug knows that you know it was your husband's mug. All the f-bomb laden texts are his attempt to deflect the blame and stop you from bringing up the OTHER  stuff Doug broke or ~~misplaced~~ stole.

"&gt; In another thread, he said his parents tried to sue for partial custody. They are not just selfish, they are insane.
&gt; 

What the fuck? This is the point at which you stop visiting these people at all. They want to break up the wife's family (despite her mother having Parkinson's), tried to steal OP's daughter and, when that didn't work, started insisting they be allowed to physically discipline her. I cannot believe OP and his wife have put up with this. "
"For somebody her age, she is very immature. She is applying pressure on you to get involved in something you are clearly not comfortable with, and that is *not* you being a prude. That's you being a normal person with his very own boundaries. All I can think of is her bringing this up in future, in order to get a permission to have sex with other men. And regardless, even if it *is* her fantasy, she is shaming you for your idea of a healthy marriage, whilst forcing you to accept hers. That is selfish and hypocritical. 

You need to be honest with her and tell her that it is simply not something you are comfortable with, and ask her to imagine you forcing her to do something she is not comfortable with. Also, ask her to read about the kind of implications such arrangement can have on your marriage, even if you did feel comfortable with it. "
"&gt;  he finds it kind of exciting to do it with someone else

This is key.

I don't think it is helpful to figure out whether this is ""weird"", or whether it counts as gay, bi or straight behavior. What is important is that this is a sexual turn on that one partner is sharing with someone outside the marriage. For most people in monogamous marriages that's a no-go area.

It's fine if you don't want to make a big deal about this, but if this a boundary for you, you need to communicate that to your husband. If it isn't you should probably start communicating where those boundaries are exactly, since he was fine with doing this in secret for years."
Actually she wasn't. She was a pretty good mom. 
"There's nothing wrong with you; you've just had bad luck.  Keep putting yourself out there and dating.

"It sounds like your aunt is trying her best to accept you. She probably doesn't know how to behave around a gay man, as she's probably never really interacted with a gay dude. She's going g off of her limited knowledge, she's trying.

Your uncle on the other hand sounds like a douche. Call him out on it. ""Uncle I mat be gay but that does effect my masculinity, my opinion on politics, or my knowledge of sports. If you would kindly stop mocking me because of my sexuality, I would greatly appreciate it. Jesus said love thy neighbor, and you're not very loving."" "
"I was just gearing up to comment this. Beat me to it! 

Tim's behavior reminds me of something I occasionally do. I plan a romantic thing and then expect my partner to read my mind and do exactly what I need him to do to make the thing go well, dropping what I think are obvious hints (they're not). When he goes about his life as normal instead of magically knowing to change his behavior for this romantic thing, I pout and get short with him - the thing is supposed to be a *surprise*, so I can't tell him why I'm pouting, but in my head he's ruining it and should have just *known*. It's honestly childish and I'm working on it, but I'm seeing some parallels between what I've just described, and Tim's behavior."
I dated someone exactly like this.  It escalated to nightly rape.  Get out now.  It's been six years and I still can't have sex while sober because of what he did to me.  Get out now.  You sound exactly how I sounded.  My life was ruined.  Don't let him to that to you.  Do not be me.  Get out now.

"&gt;  And sometimes things go wrong, even in picture perfect situations. So, again, it is what it is. All that matters is finding a solution.

No.  This was never a ""picture perfect situation"", how could you even say that with a straight face?  Finding a solution is absolutely not all that matters.  Your responsibility in this matters - and I'm not seeing where you acknowledge it.

You should *never* have accepted a dog when you knew you couldn't care for it.  You should never have asked a cash-strapped, stressed and seriously ill family member to take on *your* responsibilities.  You should never have allowed that situation to persist for *a full year* when not only could you not physically keep the dog you clearly can't afford one.  

You frame this like its about your mother and doubtless she could have handled it differently, but its not about her.  This is your dog.  Its your responsibility.  Its your failing.

The fact is you will never find boarding for four months for less than 575 - I work in animal welfare, I know.  It simply doesnt exist.  There aren't other people who want to take on your responsibilities until whenever you feel like taking them back.  Even your own mother doesn't want to do that.  Please surrender the dog to a good, no kill rescue.  They will find it a better home than you could possibly offer.  I'm sorry if that makes you sad, but its not about you.  Find a form of therapy that's not going to leave a living being in limbo."

"Screw exclusivity bullshit everyone is going on about. She LIED right to your face and had no issues doing it. She knew very well what she did was incredibly shitty otherwise she wouldn't have lied!. Imagine she cheated on you few years down the line and decides its not worth mentioning because she ends up regretting it and decides she wants to stay with you instead. You're an idiot if you think you should let her off the hook just cause she shed some tears. Shes only crying cause she got caught.


As to your friend, he is NOT your friend. If he regretted what he did he would have told you about it later on and apologized but no they both decided to keep this their ""dirty little secret"". 


Regardless of what you decide to do, do that poor girl (your friends gf) a favor and let her know whats going on. Your buddy is probably cheating on her with others and exposing her to STDs too so she needs to know whats up. 6 yrs is a long time sure but at the same time he had no issue throwing it all away which shows how little he cared. You'll be responsible for her misery if you decide to keep this secret.  "
"Yea, his response makes him sound super creepy and that he's just pretending he doesn't remember because he didn't get what he wanted. I mean if he *truly* doesn't remember, the decent thing to do would be to (at least) apologize to you because it is clearly something that has upset you (not to mention seriously messed up). Not that apologizing will do much but at least it will show that he's owning up to his own actions. He clearly is not and I really hope he gets some sort of punishment for what he has done to you.

I'm really proud that you stood up for yourself and brought it up to your supervisor. Hope the police are able to do something and that things work out for you!"
"I think she is telling you that she just can't work at this job she hates anymore.  She needs your help.  The way I see it is part of my duty as a husband is to support my wife when she is suffering.  Your wife is suffering right now.

Yes the ultimatum is not right, and you guys should go to counseling to discuss this, because that is really unfair to you.  You have a right to tell her it is unfair, and not the way you should be communicating and handling your problems.  Your marriage is young though and you are still learning this stuff.   

However I think as her husband you should cut back on your classes and get the part time jobs again so she can take a different job and take classes too.  It is only going to delay you. 

Sacrifice is what love and marriage is all about.  Taking care of your wife is your honor.  If she is a good woman she will appreciate this.   "

"&gt; Mum said they would not let me get an abortion because it is their grandchild and I had no right to take that away from them.

&gt; My mother left some voice messages saying I was ‘destroying our family’

That's on them, not on you.

I would look into getting what's called a ""legal emancipation."" As a minor, your parents still potentially have a lot of control over your life, even if you're not living with them. They basically have power of attorney over your life. For example, if you end up unconscious in the hospital, they get to make decisions for you.

Legal emancipation is where you sever any legal ties, so they lose any control they had over the decisions you make."
Maybe I should ask my ex to be there (kidding)
"This right here. I come from China, which still has issues with female infanticide and abortion of female fetuses regularly, and consequently has tons more males than females. My father aka sperm donor didn't want me because I was a girl. It's his loss.

The way you've phrased this is like a beautiful set of song lyrics.
Everyone here has pretty much covered the fact that a $2000 poncho is ridiculous and your girlfriend is over the top (and ungrateful) for wanting such an extravagant gift. So I'm gonna add this... the monogramming on it IS the main focus so I can understand why she's disappointed that it's not monogrammed the way she expected/wanted. I'd be willing to bet that a large part of the reason she wanted this in the first place is for the status of having her future name on it. She probably sees it as a way of tying herself to you before getting the engagement ring.
He's still in love with her. There's no other way to spin this. I'm sorry. 
"Your sister made a decision to pursue a career in pornography, something that not only affects her but your whole family as well.  Your parents are also devout in their faith, supporting what they see as a vice isn't something they feel they can do.  

This was your sisters choice, now she needs to live with the consequences.  You are a grown man, how you treat this situation is up to you but don't think there isn't reason behind your parents decision."
"Can't answer regarding over reacting (though I have strong opinions regarding people telling their partners they're emotional and over reacting when there's a disagreement).

However, since your cat has just gotten lost, thought I should ask if you'd heard of luring her home with a familiar scent? Basically line a box with something that she uses regularly (i.e. blanket, toy etc) - specifically one that has her scent on it.  Leave it outside (on your patio).  That might help her find her own way home.

"yeah, like 100%.

i've been with my husband for 19 years.  he's never raised his hand to me.  and we've had some disagreements, let me tell you, and frankly, some of them i was so in the wrong that i couldn't have even faulted him if he'd been tempted.  (though believe me, i would've packed my shit immediately if he had.)

i was in a dozen relationships before i met him.  they never raised their hands to me.  

i'd be absolutely shocked and horrified if one of my friends told me the story you just did about her husband, because it's so *not normal* in a healthy, mutually respectful relationship.

"Have you sat down and talked to him face-to-face about his anger towards your boyfriend and the picture in question? I mean his reaction seems pretty ridiculous to most of us, but then again there is a generation gap.

I mean, maybe he thinks that your boyfriend PHOTOSHOPPED all that demon stuff on you, like, going through a lot of time and effort to turn you into a demon, which is pretty different from just a Snapchat filter. 

EDIT: Edited to add--did your dad like your boyfriend BEFORE this incident? If he had problems with your boyfriend in the first place, this may have been the thing that pushed him over the edge. "
"Very liberal, very Catholic convert here. (I read at Mass and teach religious ed to children, so I'm pretty involved.)

But, it's possible top believe in God, Jesus, transubstantiation while still actively fighting homophobia, voting pro-choice, etc. Her parents may have zero experience with liberal Catholics and may think she's going to go super conservative. 

That said, my very liberal parents never pulled any of this when I converted... they respected me and knew I was intelligent enough to reconcile the tensions between my personal beliefs and some of the beliefs of my church. "
You should consider where you live when the child is born too. If you are in your current state and your ex gets partial custody you may not be able to move away. You need to discuss this with your lawyer.
"You can't, really.  You need to just tell him the news, and give him a chance to respond.  If it's bad, let him know you hope he'll give it some more thought once the surprise wears off, as you really want the baby to know its grandpa and have a connection to its heritage.  But for the most part, you should really let your girlfriend take the lead here."
"&gt; but if you move in together you won't. Does that mean you expect HER to perform all the chef and maid services? Or do you mean that you'll start doing that work as soon as she moves in with you? If it's the latter, she probably wants proof that you're capable. If it's the former, she has good reason to be worried.

I just wanted to repeat this, OP. You say when she's asked you about it that ""it won't affect [future home life or kids] in any way."" How does *that* work? This is your lifestyle, and *someone* has to cook and clean for you to maintain it. Your girlfriend is entirely justified to ask who you expect that to be if you stay together long-term. She is justified also to not wish to have a maid and chef in her own future. She's *smart* to try to think about how your current lifestyle will affect her lifestyle if you stay together. If you want a traditional home life with a wife and kids, I suggest you follow her suit and consider what that life will look like."

"There is so much dysfunction in this update that I'm not even sure where to start...your husband sounds like an unsupportive pushover, and honestly I don't know how the two of you can stand being around each other, given how often you seem to fight with each other.

Also, you sound like you're so tightly wound that you're looking to explode over any little thing.  You had a *45-minute* argument with him because he arrived home 15 minutes after you asked him to?  Are you kidding me?  I think I would become emotionally disengaged with someone who sought out conflict like that."
"I do think that ""implied exclusivity"" is a valid argument in many cases, but the fact that you had previously dragged your feet complicates matters. You say this:

&gt;  I love this girl, I saw a future with her, she's kind of been my end all be all sort of person, even when we were broken up.

but you were the one who wouldn't commit to her. Look at this from her point of view; how was she supposed to know you were in it for real the second time, if you hadn't told her?

Edit: Further down in the comments you clarify that the first time you two dated, you actually *did* agree to be exclusive, but you talked to other girls behind her back. Did you seriously expect her to read your mind and put you in the boyfriend zone after your sketchy behavior? I think you should be thankful for what you have now that you're both committed to each other, and not overthink this."

"My ex wife began selling Arbonne a couple of years before we split up.   While she did find success, it took about twice as long as they said and was a hell of a lot more work, and it changed her to the core.  She was leaving me home alone with our son 3 to 5 evenings a week and at least 1 weekend a month to go do Arbonne parties, retreats, seminars, you name it.  She changed a lot of her friends, she started going out and wining and dining with her new friends, leaving me at home with our son.  Arbonne was almost like having another man steal her away.  Her upline was always telling her she was a ""rock star"" buying her Tiffany's jewelry and Coach bags.  She became this vain, materialistic, greedy person.  She eventually earned that white Mercedes that they promised, but she sold her soul and lost her marriage for it.

"You're overthinking this. You are moving across the country. How is he going to be vindictive? It already reflects poorly on him so many people left, and now he is full on leaning on you.

If you stay, what are you and your girlfriend going to do ?

When you're interviewing on the other side of the country, just say that you have been hounding your manager for months to hire a replacement and he wouldn't. That you knew for months you'd be moving there with your girlfriend, and actually stayed longer than intended (lease stopped weeks and week before you quit your job). He cannot legally confirm or deny anything during a reference check, there are some pretty strict rules about what he can say."

I am glad to hear you agree. It'll make my decision easier."
"You found one single detail of his life you didn't know about. Stop being so dramatic. This is awful, you acting like your marriage has been overturned and you're here trying to piece it back together. You aren't the victim; you're self-centered.

"The last wedding I went to was that of a best friend of the guy I was seeing at the time. I asked him to help me pick out a dress and he suggested one I have and love that has a very appropriate but flattering fit on me. Thing is, it's white with an all-over black pattern. I immediately shot that down, and it isn't even really a white dress, strictly speaking."
"Honestly, I can kind of side more with your parents than your sister. She does need therapy, but you should be able to find some sort of free option or a youth center or somewhere for her to get help.

Think of it more from your parent's perspective. They have taught you guys for a long time that the cabin is dangerous, especially that lake. Your sister asks of she can go there, they say no, then she lies and goes anyway. Then she and her friends drink into oblivion and one of them **dies**. Of course right now they are going to blame her. If she had not decided to lie and take her friends there, no one would have been drowning in the lake. Just because your sister didn't intend to let her friend drown doesn't mean that she shouldn't be punished for what she did.

Also, as for your mother being embarassed... I am assuming this but likely she is embarassed that she's the parent of the kid who brought her friends to a cabin without permission resulting in the death in the community. She is probably being looked down on by other parents and may be getting nasty emails and phone calls.

And your Dad is allowed to nag about it and be a worry wart. Just because at this time the parents of Mike aren't suing (they're still grieving and probably aren't sure what they're going to do) doesn't mean they won't change their minds. They may have friends or family who will urge them to sue and they could decide to at any time. Yes, this could destroy your father. He may lose his cabin, a lot of money... I'm not sure but possibly jail time?

So what I'm saying is... despite you saying your sister is *usually* a good kid and didn't mean for anyone to get hurt, she is honestly responsible and your parents are allowed to be furious and don't need to baby her. She's almost an adult. She does need therapy. How you can help her is finding her a free option."
"I think at your age it's okay to be candid and honest with your parents. Ask them if you can install a lock on the door- or do it and handle the backlash, whichever you think is easier. If they think it is an overreaction, explain that you desire privacy and you don't want your sister to walk in on you in various stages of undress as it is your room- if you don't want to go the ""morning wood"" route of explanation. 

I work with adolescents who have special needs and it is VERY important to set boundaries with them. Setting boundaries often sets them up for success. Even if they don't always understand WHY they can't do (insert thing here), they know they shouldn't do it. 

I'm not sure what her diagnosis is or what her comprehension is, but you could explain that you have installed a lock because you dress and undress in your room and want privacy- though depending on the severity of her autism it might not be a concept she understands.

If she likes to talk to you in the mornings you could always tell her ""when I am up and dressed we can talk over breakfast"" or something else to that effect. Communicate you aren't shutting her out or kicking her out or trying to push her away- offer some kind of morning chat alternative."

"You need to have a serious sit down conversation with your wife. Tell her very clearly that you're not going to have another child until you two work out the issues listed above. Offer therapy, you two both need it. She needs it apart and you both need it together. This is an unhealthy relationship for you and your daughter. If she won't go, you need to move on. This isn't going to get better and resentment will grow."
"Congrats on setting up a lifetime of familial resentment!

"My now ex boyfriend LOVED my hair long. Long brown curly hair is his favorite. Well I told him I was going to cut and donate it and he was sad but supportive. He went with me to my hair cut and when she chopped off the pony tail his eyes were screaming. After my hair cut and she styled it he loved it and thought it looked so cute. He also went to the cancer center at the hospital with me to drop off the hair. 
He never made it about himself or his preferences. He was supportive and excited for me. He was also proud I donated my hair. It was scary as hell and I was sad about my hair but it's hair and it grows back. "
Flip it around for him. What if you were telling him you wanted to name your son after a high school crush... who was still in your life? He'd be asking for a paternity test. It's not ok at all. Even a tiny bit. It's super creepy and everyone you know will be talking about it behind your backs. He needs to admit this. 
Sounds like you and your brother need to jettison about 300 pounds from your lives completely.

" Let him know what it means to be family and he can either accept Blake as part of the family or he can not be a part of it. Really though, you need to get to the root of why Alex feels this way. I bet he has some underlying fear that when he leaves you will replace him with Blake and he will be out of the picture. He's acting out for a reason, and my guess is he feels in competition with Blake for your affection. Possibly Blake while not intending it, is more successful in school and this makes Alex feel inadequate and like he's being compared to him even though you are doing no such thing. Bottom line, talk to Alex, find out what is really going on. And tell your husband to grow a pair and take part in the family or him and Alex can be miserable sods together."
"I do not have advice, but may be able to provide insight.

From my experience, passive aggressiveness is a by-product of resentment. It seems as if he resents the situation, possibly because the pregnancy happened before schedule. Maybe he sees this as a hindrance to whatever plans he had for himself or the both of you. You need to be more firm in getting him to open up because resentment only gets worse with time.

*""I understand that I (Edit: **we**) got pregnant sooner than planned, but I have noticed that you are being passive aggressive and I want us to address this now.""*"
"You're right in that when you're dating it's not your place. However, your'e engaged now. It's still not really your place to tell her. But it's a perfectly reasonable conversation to say ""If we're getting married our finances become 'ours'"" and this stops. We're saving up for a wedding so it really needs to stop now so that I'm not footing the entire bill. If you can't do that; tell me now. It doesn't provide an ultimatum, but it certainly points out there may be a decision you need to make.  
As a side note. Do not marry this girl if she can't cut that tie. It'll end poorly."
"Your mother manipulated you into buying her an expensive laptop that you cannot at all afford, when she had two functioning alternatives.  That is absurd.  You need to stop going along with these things and hiding them from the other adults in your life that are trying to protect you, or at the very least, who don't want to subsidize your mother's irresponsibility.  Your student loan money is for you to go to school.  It is not for your mother to get a fancy laptop.  If your mother can only love you when you're buying her gifts, she is a parasite.  "
"It could be that your husband is not a 'mama's' boy in the conversation sense of the term but that you becoming pregnant and the thought of having his own child has changed his world view a bit. It's a big responsibility to have your own child and it can sometimes change how you relate to your parents because you're shifting from 'child of parent' to 'parent of child'. Especially if one of those parents likes to lean hard on the ol' 'family togetherness' or 'I'm your mother and I just want what's best for you' aspect of the relationship. She might be pushing hard into his headspace and he's not recognising it as interference because he's too close. 

You can either go to counselling - a neutral third party can listen to both of your perspectives and help you find a middle ground that's acceptable to you both, or you can sit him down and do a 'big picture' conversation. (Both is good too). You have two issues: the baby name thing, and the 'my baby, my grandchild, stealing the baby' thing. 

The name thing is fairly easy to nail down. Right now, you've been addressing it in the moment, and then he forgets (or 'forgets'). Sit him down and have a conversation where you address the pattern of it. 

&gt; ""DH, for the last few months, you've been really weirdly obsessed sharing the baby names we've discussed with your mother, and asking me to talk to her about what she thinks of them. It's not just once or twice, it's every single time we discuss this. I know you love your mother and I like her too, but I feel like you're trying to push her into our discussions about our baby when it should just be between the two of us, as parents. We agreed to not share the name until our kid is born. I love that and it's important to me. Please, can you stop asking me to discuss the names with your mother?"" 

And with your MIL and the baby thing, you can also do a 'big picture' conversation or an 'in the moment' one. 

&gt; ""[MIL], please don't say you're going to steal her. It's really weird and creepy."" 

&gt; ""[MIL], this is not your baby and when you keep saying that, it hurts my feelings. I'm their mother. They are *my* baby. Please don't say it anymore.""

&gt; ""I am taking care of *my* baby just fine. Please don't refer to them as yours.""

&gt; [MIL], you keep referring to my baby as yours, and it feels like you're trying to stake a claim on them before they're even born. I love you dearly and know that this isn't your intention but it's upsetting me. Please can you not do it anymore?"" 

You might have to soften it a bit but you need to stake your claim here, front and center, for your baby, even if it's 'NOT HOW OUR FAAAAAAAAAAAAAMILY WORKS!'. The family structure in India and the relationships between families are often a lot 'closer' than many westeners are used to (gross generalisation), and also, she's probably quite used to not having resistance to how she is because most people take it in stride. Pushing back will probably rub her the wrong way but you've done it before and survived and so has your husband. You aren't just laying down boundaries for yourself now, you're doing it for your baby and future children, too.  
"
"This is unacceptable. My husband is Indian (moved to the US when he was 7) and grew up in a dynamic where his dad blew up about everything and it has definitely seeped into his own personality. I know it can be an ""Indian thing"" but that does not make it acceptable. Your husband is reacting to things like how clean the house is and how you prepare snacks with anger?? That is inconceivable. He's a grown man and can clean it himself. I don't care where he's from. Honestly you sound like a saint and your husband should be proud to have you. I am still a work in progress with Indian cooking after 2 years of marriage but my husband and I are learning together. He still appreciates when I try. 

If you're afraid for your safety you should reconsider your situation. I understand the desire to try to work things out and I think divorce should be a last resort. That said, your husband has to want to change and actively try to improve his responses. 

Also, I'm with you on the cake feeding thing. I've only ever seen immediate family feed cake to the person whose birthday it is. I would be a little weirded out to do it with a friend. I'm American though (read:white) so take that with a grain of salt."

"Yeah I mean OP holy shit, you're really going to make the end of your life some drama show about staying in a shitty relationship? 

OP, maybe I should put it this way.... people change **over time**. Like, years. **YEARS**. The odds that your boyfriend is going to just suddenly snap and become this amazing perfect guy for you? Nonexistant. 

Let me tell you what your best case scenario is OP - and with your illness timetable you should tell me if this is what you want.

Best case scenario is that **today** he signs up for therapy. He'll spend a couple years hashing out each one of his issues one by one. He'll learn how to become an adult and how to process his feelings, he'll learn how to respect you and how to maintain a stable relationship, he'll stop with the ultimatums and threats, and he'll become a better person. But up to that point, year(s) from now, nothing will really change. You'll spend the last months of your life in a miserable relationship you're complacent in but can't leave because you're scared. But it's OK because the last week of your life, after months or year(s) of being miserable waiting to see if he leaves you - you finally know that he won't leave you! And you can die knowing you made the end of your life entirely about whether or not this guy loves you.

It's like a shitty romance novel. Girl dying slowly, guy is a total piece of shit, but Oh good - he said he loved her right before she died so the last months of crying and feeling alone were totally worth it.

...and that's **Best** case scenario. You want to know what's really going to happen? The same thing, except after you spend all that time waiting for him to change, he'll leave you a couple weeks before you die, and then everything will have been for naught.

Do you really want to make the last week of your life some wager about whether or not some douche bag who treats you badly would finally stop being a douche bag and treating you badly? Do you **really** want to fucking roll those dice? Because that's **not** the end I want for myself, and it's not the end I want for you. 

Explore. Live. Laugh. Learn. Scream. Laugh. Do literally anything except stay with this guy just as some last ditch effort to ""not die alone"". Wouldn't you rather die ""alone"" (single), but having lived your life to the fullest? I promise you, you might die single - but you WILL NOT die alone. I promise. Even if that means you just want to PM me and have someone physically with you during the end. Just don't wait on this guy to figure out how to be a person. Live your life. Please."
"That's ""call the police"" gross. You are totally in the right, he's disgusting and I would not be able to continue a friendship with someone like that. "
Then you're the jet pack!
"So creepy. Pretend to be on the phone when he's away. Say something that could be taken in the totally wrong way. See what he says. 

3 possibilities here. 

1. You're crazy, which I doubt 

2. He's spying because he is crazy ( get him to a doc. Can we say brain tumor??)

3. He's cheating and projecting onto you. 

However it pans out, I'd love an update. "
"I think that the only way to start to repair this is by being super honest with your parents. Tell them that the kind of sex you have with your husband is none of their business but it is completely consensual. Tell them you are not being abused and your sister was just trying to get back at you and has crossed a very serious line. Also ask them to delete the video or give it back to you, for your own peace of mind. "
"Yep. The parents basically created this problem in the first place and then instead of parenting they thought mockery would be easier than teaching good habits and providing loving support.

I actually suspect that subconsciously they feel bad that he is losing the weight. Like, they tell themselves he is just ""like that"" so as to deny they were bad parents to him. Now he's an adult and showing that he *can* lose the weight, it becomes even more obvious that living with them was the cause, so they are in denial about that too."
"Bro, if you give in, you are a fucking coward. Stand with your wife. 

Your mom needs to spank so much that she's willing to ruin a family get-together? Fuck her and her ultimatums. 

Your sister blaming this all on you isn't right, and if you can't make her see that, there isn't much you can do. The drama is entirely your mom's fault. "
"Goddammit this is *not* the correct response. Even ignoring that it does nothing to add anything to the conversation except pointless antagonism. 

I'll put it this way, and I know this isn't an entirely accurate metaphor, but here we go: 

When you were a kid, let's say your parents didn't let you watch TV at all. You grew up not watching TV, and as a result you ended up reading a lot and being more physically active because you weren't able to watch TV, and those are traits you've maintained and can see the beneficial results of well into your adult life. 

Not watching TV became normal to you. Sure you might have gotten a little annoyed at your parents every once in a while for not letting you watch TV, but you were used to it and eventually you realized they were doing it because they loved you and thought that was a good approach to raising you into a smart, active adult. 

But, that ignores the fact that many people think that not allowing a child to watch any TV is depriving them of cherished childhood experiences, retarding their social interactions with their peers, and keeping them from understanding or being aware of a very large cornerstone of modern culture. 

Now, fast forward to when you're about to have kids. You're still living that active lifestyle, you're still very interested in reading and learning, and your primary example for how to love and treat your children is the way that your parents loved and treated you. So you consider also banning TV for your own kids, and you make mention of this to an acquaintance.

""You'd be a fucking awful parent, and your kid will have a crappy childhood and is going to grow up damaged from not having that cultural background!"" your acquaintance tells you heatedly. 

*But wait,* you think. *My parents were good people. They loved me very much. My childhood wasn't that bad, I had books and games. Hell, 100 years ago they didn't even have TV and everyone turned out okay.* ""I think I turned out fine"" you say to the other person. 

""Evidently not, since you think it's okay to deprive your kids of TV.""

------

Now, can you see how that's a bad response? And how this entire issue is even an issue at all? 

Spanking doesn't happen because people hate children, or because someone's parents were terrible people, or even out of simple incompetence. Spanking happens because that was one of the best ways we knew how to handle situations, and because someone's parents loved them and thought that spanking was how you made sure that you *weren't* an awful parent. 

When you come out and attack spanking as abuse, you imply that someone's parents were horrible monsters and that the person is damaged. Nobody wants to hear that, and it isn't going to change their minds anyways because they *know* it isn't true for themselves. 

Rather, equate it to something like not using anesthesia during surgery. It used to be the best solution we had, but times have changed and now we know better. That doesn't mean the surgeon didn't do a good job, it just means that you have the tools at your disposal to do a *better* one.

"Be reasonable with her, and supply an out.  She's digging in her heels because she believes the demands are coming from people who hate her, rather than people who hate her and good sense.  Tell her you know she doesn't want to steal attention from the bride , and her dress will do exactly that.  Go dress shopping together, maybe even 2nd hand, and try to find something that could be converted to a flapper dress.  Or even make it a group project.  
She's probably been rejected from many groups if she is latching onto a group she knows doesn't like her.  Try to get the group to recognize she's reaching out (instead of just being annoying), but she is still hurt.  I think if the group could come together to make or modify a dress for her, it would create an awesome dynamic in the group."
"People in here are quick to jump to conclusions and quick to feed an OP's insecurities. I think it's shitty that people are going to make you feel worse than you do and make you think something might be true, when there is the possibility that this could be innocent.

While I think you should definitely get to the bottom of this, I think you need to play this very carefully. If he did cheat you can't let him on to your suspicions, because he could work on covering it up. If you are wrong you might be falsely accusing your husband of cheating and could cause similar damage to the relationship. I think you should exhaust every possibility before focusing on cheating. Insecurity can make people believe things that may not be true as some posts in this sub have shown.

I think you need to go down every avenue that you can. Check the camera (if you still have it) to see if the photo is still on there and see if there is a date on there. There should be information as to when the photo was put on the computer too (right click, properties, Date modified). If other pictures are grouped with it from around the same time, then you might be able to pinpoint a better time-frame as to when the picture was taken.

If you and your husband would get drunk and/or experimented with drugs in college and there is a possibility you took the picture without you remembering it (even accidentally handing the camera), then you shouldn't dismiss it. I simply think this could be a possibility because it sounds like a terrible, unflattering picture and you guys were younger and at an age where things like this are common.

If that was the type of friend that would come over unannounced or if husband had friends/roommates that would do something immature like bust in on him jerking off and take a picture, then you need to consider that too.

The next and last thing you should do, if all your detective work and self questioning/recalling leads you to this, is to talk to your husband. I would let him know that this picture has shook your marriage more than he knows and you need to know the truth. Tell him you know it can't be x because y and so on, if you feel he's being untruthful. Ultimately, it's up to you whether you believe him or not.

I'm not going to lie. This doesn't look good for your husband. This might be something you never learn the truth about. If this is the case, I think there's only 3 possibilities for your marriage. The first would be to divorce. You feel like you can't trust him and want to move on from the mystery that's driving you crazy. The second is you assume he did cheat, decide you can forgive him because of reasons (he's been a good husband, it was so long ago, etc.) and you guys try to move passed it. The last outcome is you believe he didn't cheat and proceed from there.

I don't think any outcome is wrong. I'm not sure if I can say to go nuclear without more proof, but I don't think this should be swept under the rug either. I just hope however you decide to go about this, that you keep your wits and don't get too overrun with emotion that you can't see the situation clearly in whatever direction you lean towards."
"Maybe I'm old fashioned, but I have no idea how this works for any girl. "
"Are your parents facing their own legal action as a result of the drowning? Since it happened on their property, they could still be held responsible.

If that's the case,  they might be really scared about it and are taking it out on your sister. "
"Seconding this as a solution.

My grandmother often asks where her husband is, or sometimes her parents. I find it easier to simply say ""He/They aren't here right now,"" as a way of not necessarily lying, but still informing her that they aren't present. *If* she asks a second time, then I will lie and tell her they're out right now - again, I don't say where or what they're doing, simply that they are ""out.""

One thing to remember is that even if your grandmother can't remember the conversation, she'll still *feel* the way your response emotionally elicited afterward, and that can snowball into a bad mood for the remaining duration of your visit with her.

For example, if you tell her that her husband is dead, she will likely be shocked: angry, sad, scared. While she may not remember that conversation in 10 minutes time, she may still feel anxious or sad, and that mood can be hard to eradicate.

On the flip side, if you continue to entertain her and present her with diversions that she enjoys, that good mood may stay with her after you've ended your visit, making her interactions with others more pleasant."
"I think that you need to realize that if she is this easily influenced by her BFs then she is also probably this easily influenced by you, and other friends, which means the friend you think you know may not be the real her."
"If the husband has seen this thread, he's not going to react this way. Unless OP posted this from a public library computer, he already knows about this thread and will adjust his behavior accordingly."
"I'd say if you're working that much, then you shouldn't be expected to do 50% of the housework. Tidy up after yourself and help a bit when you can but if she's not working and there's no kids then keeping up a small apartment shouldn't be a huge chore. 

Imagine how much worse it would be with a big house to take care of. With a yard and outside maintenance as well.

Talk it out and see how it goes. If nothing changes you'll be physically and emotionally exhausted before long."
"&gt;Apparently there was some closing of doors on her arms, fractured ribs, and possible choking (although my dad insists he didn't choke her and was only 'holding her down')

What the fuck. Why are you even in the same house as this guy? "
"&gt;Btw, since your mom supposedly gets $1 000 every month for her personal use, couldn't your dad just reimburse you from that? Not that it would stop her from stealing credit cards, but it would still be some kind of a consequence for her. 


This is a great idea OP. Even if you get $250 from it a month until the debt is paid off?

"SQUEEEEEE! This is the cutest update I've ever seen. I'm the ""spoiler alert: I hated my best friend's boyfriends because I was in love with her"" lesbian from your last post and I am SO glad this turned out so much better for you than it did for me. ;)

Congratulations and I wish you both all the happiness in the world."
You're not an idiot. You were a scared young girl.
She wasn't close with my mother at all. My mom called her Dullison when she wasn't around. All SIL does is talk about herself for attention then leave. I don't know what my brother saw in her.
"She is with the married man because this way she is ""safe"" and in control.  He is not her responsibility, and there is zero chance of a committment while he is still married.  If something happens to him, she doesn't take the brunt of the loss.  She probably wants the closeness of a relationship without the fear of trauma and loss.  I am not excusing her behavior necessarily, but it is understandable.  "
"Right? And then the turning it back around on me and justifying it while claiming he isn't. Ugh, it's just disgusting, and I defended this piece of shit over and over less than 24 hours ago. He managed to get to a place where he was calling *me* a slut and accusing me of giving him STDs. I've been shaking for 2 hours straight. 

If he had shown some actual genuine remorse, it would still be over, but at least maybe we could have parted with some mutual respect and love and all that. Nope, I'm sitting on a curb a few blocks from the house because he was screaming at me for being a slut and fucking his friend (that I've never even met) and I actually started considering killing one or both of us because he just wouldn't leave me alone. 

*That's* the guy I stood up for. Yeah, I way misjudged this one. I rarely even get angry, but this one is just too much. "

"My advice is to try to get involved in *groups* that do this kind of thing as opposed to befriending individuals. Look on meet-up or the internet for homebrew classes or shooting classes (my local shooting range has ladies night 1x/week), or a pilots group.

I'm an attractive female and I homebrew and shoot guns, and have zero problems with being hit on with the men involved, mostly because of the way I approached it.

When you're involved in a more official club and group setting, it's pretty clear you're there for the hobby and not there for romantic interactions. And you'll form platonic friendships within the group setting that then you can individualize if you choose to."

"Hey op,

You're not over reacting. But probably some people are just hiding their emotions and not being open about it. You are right to be worried. 

It might be a good idea if you check here if there is any subreddit related to the area you are in, and post there asking for some info. For all its worth, best of luck!"
Do you have a gaming console in the main room? A computer being used for streaming to the TV? A really new TV with smart features?
"will do thank you :)

Will CPS help get him into my custody? I don't really want him living with some random people. "
"Yeah I would literally just respond with ""What? She went home early... ::insert screenshot confirmation here::"""
"""I don't want a baby, abort!"" to getting down on one knee in the space of two weeks is one hell of a turnaround.  I think OP should be wary to see if this ""new outlook"" actually sticks, particularly with the overbearing, over protective and far too involved mother."
"I mean at the point she's asking for advice you can say honestly what you think is best but also add she is an adult and needs to make the decision ultimately. 

Ask her how many times she's willing to forgive him considering this has happened twice and they aren't even married yet. "
"He moved in with you. Tossed your food. Inconvenienced you by *taking over* YOUR fridge and you think you might be unreasonable somehow?

You're not.

He needs to leave. Now.
I suggest you begin the eviction process before he tries to throw out your wool clothes, feather couch or causes any more damage to your items.

There is Vegan then there is *Miltant Vegan* and he is one of those. They are almost incapable of living with others due to fanatical their beliefs.

He's not stable."
That's weird as hell. I know young people who are super-anti smartphone people. They still have old flip phones so their grandmas can call them. Sheesh.
"My friend had a girlfriend who would constantly wake him up in the middle of the night to talk about things that he did during the day that pissed her off. He asked her to please bring it up at the time of the offense so they can talk about it or fix it. She said that she didn't want to ruin their day/lunch/dinner/night. Instead, her solution was to continually wake him up in the middle of the night to berate him about this petty shit. My friend had a very physical job that starts early in the morning, so over time, the lack of sleep was driving him crazy.

He broke up with her after a year, then had a good night's rest.

OP is a saint for putting up with this for 3 years."
"I had an ex-roommate who moved out but left a large amount of her personal belongings, she gave me the excuse she didn't have time this week to grab it. So I moved everything out onto the sidewalk including her fish tank and sent her a text saying ""I don't care if you have time or not, your things are on the sidewalk and your fish is getting cold."" What do you know she was outside within 15 minutes grabbing her belongings. Sometimes you have to be a dick and stand your ground, there is nothing wrong with it."
I feel like an idiot that this never occurred to me. *facepalm*
"Definitely agree. If this awful woman thinks it's okay to slap anyone (be it her son's girlfriend or a stranger) and not apologise, I think your sister should at least file a complaint with the police. You forget, this woman is justifying slapping someone she thought was you, OP. Get your sister to press charges and go no contact with the crazy mother"
I wanted to believe it so bad but it was a bad lie. I think moving would be good though. 
Preventing her from losing her career could be interpreted as trying to help. 
"You lived in a fairly unhealthy environment your entire life then went off to college where you realized just how unhealthy your situation was. Now, you find yourself back at home and your new habits are at odds with your family's lifestyle. This is an incredibly common thing; I experienced it myself during college. 

The good news is that you only have to put up with it during your summers. The bad news is that - to a certain extent - you sorta just have to grin and bear it being the quasi-guest now. Of course, you could do what I did and just stop going home for the summer. 

That doesn't mean you have to put up with everything, though. 

First off, your mom sounds incredibly obsessive, passive-aggressive, and controlling. There's not a whole lot you can do but put up with her disapproving off-hand remarks and to ignore them because you'll be gone again soon enough. 

As for the food: COOK YOUR OWN FOOD. If the alternative is gastrointestinal distress, then ignore your mom's petty BS and do what's healthiest for you. I got the feeling it's not so much she forbids you to cook, but that she always finds some way to guilt you about it afterwards.  WHO CARES?! Cook what you need, clean like you do, and shut her down when she complains about cleanliness. ""I used pots, X, Y, and Z. They're clean and put away and I wiped down the counters. I have no idea what the problem is."" Then walk away. If she wants to be petty, make her work for it. 

I think your best bet here is to limit your contact with your mother. If that means almost never going back home, then so be it. "
"I suspect the daughter was eating meat long before she ""came out"" to her parents about it. Unfortunately OP's son was outed before he could move out. :("
"For future reference, the correct response to that is, ""We're not talking about your parenting decisions right now.  We're talking about mine, and I need you to respect those.""  If they feel guilty about having it pointed out to them that there are other methods out there, that's their issue to deal with.

Also, why have you let them hound you on this at all?  That in and of itself is a cop-out, because it tells them this is something that can be negotiated, rather than a fact they need to accept whether they like it or not.  And if you don't see a connection between their general approach to discipline and the way you're responding to them bullying you now, I might take some time to think about that if you're still not convinced your wife has a point there can be long-term ramifications to such things."
"""I have kinks, just like billions of other people in the world. I'm sorry you had to see what you saw thanks to Sister's nosey and despicable behavior, because I would have preferred you never to know what I'm into sexually, let alone see it firsthand. You all three should look into some research into different ways people have sex because the fact that you would all jump to the conclusion that my husband is abusive due to a consensual sex tape that was stolen from us is concerning. You should all know better and so I suggest you learn about it. Once again, I'm sorry that you saw what you saw, but I take no responsibility in the fact that you saw it. Sister should not have snooped or stolen what is mine."""
"&gt;After some soul searching, I think it's actually because I'm worried how other people will judge me for not interacting properly. 

This actually really made me think, so thank you for that. There's a pressure to act in the ""right"" way, but I don't even know what that way is. I have little experience with either and awkwardness overcomes me. But put me in a room with a kid alone or with my peers, and I'm suddenly fine."
Your present girlfriend is a lunatic. It's a cat. I adopted my dog with an ex six years ago and she's seen many boyfriends come and go and none of them have mentioned the men that came before. My dog is also mum on the subject 
"Your mother should get therapy too for her own fat-issues, considering she was fat and had the same treatment from her own mother.  Maybe she is so warped that she thought what her own mother did to her was for the best.  That could be a reason why she passed on that thinking.  But I'm no therapist.  

Good luck to you and your brother."
"Oh this reminds me of the one from months ago where the GF and ""side girl"" ended up meeting up and getting wasted together at her place surprising the BF when he walked in. 

Well done for being so brave."
"&gt; Then he said that if was going to be romantic, he would at least give me wine, not vodka.

Oh okay. I'm sure you wouldn't get in trouble for *wine* being left outside your dorm room. How considerate of him. 

OP, this guy is a walking disaster. And you are not equipped to fix him. This friendship is too young for you to get overly invested in someone with such clear and heavy issues. There's nothing stopping him from pulling an even *dumber* stunt the next time he gets wasted. Time to distance yourself."
"It's not the best man that's the problem; it's *you*, OP.

Your fiancée is settling for putting all the blame on your best man. You can use him as a scapegoat and pushing him under the buss, and then you can go through with the wedding as planned. If it were me, I wouldn't be marrying you anymore, but oh well. If you want to take the high road, take responsibility for your actions and make it clear to your fiancée that, while your best man ordered and paid for the lap dances, you were still actively accepting them and you were the one to break a promise, too."
Trust your gut. I would suspect the same. There was a post here recently about a guy secretly recording him and his wife having sex. You have no idea where the cameras/mics are and what they are recording. You should not be secretly recorded in your own home.
"Now I feel like he's watching me... I'M NOT BANGING YOUR WIFE, JESUS MAN"
"Cut your losses, IMO.  Don't stay with someone who has to decide between you and someone else.  The right person for you won't ever have to make a choice like that.  "
"&gt; He tells I was being perfectly reasonable and that his brother had no reason to be upset with me, but why wouldn't he say that to him if it's true? 

Its clear to me that your boyfriends brother is a very sensitive person. Its quite possible your boyfriend was just trying to avoid conflict.I also think your boyfriend might be trying to preserve his relationship with his brother, who you said he was once very close to.

 However, I also think its likely that your boyfriend is capable of shutting this down by being completely blunt with his brother. Besides, as your SO, he needs to defend you in situations like this. I think it would be good for you to tell him that you think it would help if he didnt hold back what he thinks around his brother.

So, if your boyfriend isnt defending you, what was he doing while his brother was lashing out at you, anyway?

I am really detecting some jealousy here. Im not just saying that. I think your boyfriends brother feels like you are ""stealing his brother away"". That a very childish line of thinking, but he doesnt seem very mature to begin with.

"Might she talk to your partner about it, then, if you tell her you're worried about your daughter growing up with the same discomfort she did? "
"It wouldn't help anything, and she will never be able to forget that you said it. Please don't tell her. Your feelings may change in a few years -- 20 is really young. "
