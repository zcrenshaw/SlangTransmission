This went into a completely different direction than I was expecting good on you OP. Very well done. 
Not if you hardly remember. It all happened in the wrong circumstances.

"I'm going to offer you a pizza advice here. Don't be projecting when you get home, its the way cheaters typically blow their cover. If you go home and grill her about how she probably ate a ton of unhealthy food while she had the night to herself she's going to know something is up. If she notices a few extra pounds, simply tell her you slipped and fell into a pool of pudding and had to eat your way out to not drown. That's at least common and believable."

"It's pretty abnormal, anyone that tells you otherwise is sugarcoating it. It's not the end of the world, and it's not like you'll never go on a date, but I wouldn't exactly feel comfortable sharing that information if I was in your shoes. "
"Compliments is a big one. Women compliment other women all the time, almost to the point where it's just casual politeness. Men virtually never compliment each other, so when we do get one (usually from a woman), we are quite chuffed.

To a problematic extent, actually - it's so unusual that we often assume we're being hit on any time it happens."
"I will try this and report back.

She broke up with me."
"This was a few years ago.  I was working nights at the time, so during the day I was fast asleep.

My wife woke me up sometime around noon and told me I need to go help her with the yard work.

Me, being confused af, ask her why in the hell she's waking me up.

It turns out our friendly neighbor-lady saw my wife mowing, and politely informed her that mowing is the ""man's job"" and my wife should get my lazy ass out of bed to go help.

""Honey,"" I said, ""how many times has our neighbor been divorced?""

""Oh, shit, you're right.  Go back to sleep.""

And from then on she didn't take any more advice from our neighbor."
"A lot of stuff. I don't care about the cellulite, the birth mark, the mole, the stretch mark, the hair you forgot to pluck, the fact that you haven't trimmed ""down there"" in a week or two.

We either don't notice the ""imperfection"" at all, or else we notice and don't care. "

"They're safe bets.

You know *exactly* what you're getting at a chain restaurant anywhere in the US.

The local one-off places are hit or miss and sometimes have more limited menus, so they're a riskier choice for a date or group visit unless you already know the place."
"Wow... here OP cheated on his GF, yet... you are truly the more evil one. "
"Physically:

* Be a healthy weight. Bonus for having some muscle definition. Everyone's got their preferences. Of course abs are attractive, but they're not actually a steadfast requirement for most women. For me I'm an arms gal, so nice delts and forearms are where it's at. Heads up: If you need to lose weight then it's a hell of a lot easier to just not eat the calories instead of trying to burn them off. Change your diet to lose weight, hit the gym to build muscle.

* Have good hair. Guys don't have as much play when it comes to fashion and accessories, so your hair is one of your main ways to jazz your shit up. Visit a reputable hair dresser and ask them for their opinion. Personally I'm partial to [this style](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/5d/32/93/5d329351daa6e60681e690432d7b0009.jpg)

* Have good skin. /r/skincareaddiction is a good place to start. Just because you're a dude doesn't mean you're immune to sun damage and dead skill cells. Exfoliate once in a while, use sunscreen. 

* Have good hygiene. Shower, god damnit. Brush those teefers. Use deodorant or maybe even a couple sprays of cologne. 

* Dress well. That means clothes that fit, and clothes that are either classic or on trend. Visit a standard style store like Gap and ask for some suggestions. If you have no idea how clothes should fit look up some YouTube videos about the topic. Wear your grungy clothes and graphic Ts around the house, but not when you're potentially going to be meeting women. 

Personality/otherwise:

* Yes, surprise, women find success attractive. That doesn't mean you need to pull in $250k a year to have a shot at a date, but if you're unemployed, underemployed, or flirting from job to job it's going to likely turn a lot of women off. (Then again I had a habit of dating unemployed high school drop outs when I was younger, so if you like naive stupid 18 year old women keep that up.) Sometimes the economy is shit and people fall on hard times, and lots of women are going to understand that. But it's not helping you, is what I'm saying. 

* Have some social tact and ability to read non verbal cues. This is something only learned with experience, there's no tricks here. Try not to take social interaction too seriously, as nervousness can come across really offputting

* Humour helps. Everyone has a different sense of humour, but being funny and entertaining will draw people to you. Pro tip though: don't be that guy that just cracks nonstop jokes even when it's not appropriate. People want to hang out and talk with you, not constantly be bombarded with shit you stole from an episode on Comedy Central. 

* Having a personality. This means hobbies or causes you care about. Do you really enjoy hiking or kayaking? That's something you can share or show a potential date. Do you feel strongly about the environment and donate to a nature restoration charity? That's something to talk about. Being a bump on a log is pretty boring. And hey boring can be comfortable down the line in a relationship, but in the beginning stages of dating boring is _boring_, and you're competing with people who aren't boring. 

* I'll second the advice to have a dog because hell I'll hang around just for the pupperino

Edit: BUT YOU BETTER TREAT THAT DOG WELL, OP."
Ha. Fuck you OP. 
"High koality shit post, nice job OP"
"When women get violent. A slap, a pinch. NOT OK. As a dude you can't retaliate. DO NOT BE VIOLENT. Say what you want with words; that way we are in equal standing. The moment you put your hands on me I want nothing more to do with you.  "
"You know that whole bit about how when you're in a relationship/married, women suddenly seem to show interest in you? It's not (completely) the fact that you're taken; it's the fact that you're now interacting with these women without any ulterior motives. When a guy is single and meets a girl he's into, his behaviors may end up changing in the name of impressing the girl or presenting himself in an attractive way. He acts how he thinks will make the girl like him, rather than just being himself.

This being himself bit is the same thing going on when a taken guy interacts with a girl. Because he's not worried about courting this girl, he's able to express all the awkward, goofy, good, bad, silly, cool, and all other aspects of himself without trying to look good to her. The girl will see this guy, see the good and bad, see the full spectrum of who he is, and will then have her own opportunity to decide if she likes him or not.

I think the whole ""be yourself"" advice is considered bad when you have a predetermined list of what's attractive, and if you use that list and see that you don't follow many things on that list, then you're not attractive, and being yourself is thus also not attractive. The problem is, girls can be attracted to anything, for any reason. In my case, I'm a generally awkward dude, but the girl I'm talking to right now finds my awkwardness endearing because she's also a bit awkward and we have that in common. Suddenly, that ""unattractive quality"" of being awkward is now my asset.

If you're an awkward, dirty-humored, animal-loving, weed-smoking, beer-hating person, be that person; someone will like you for those things. The difficult part is just having the guts to put yourself out there and letting everyone see these things. The idea of being judged is scary, but if you're brave enough to show who you are anyway, people will see that courage and authenticity and respect that, even if they don't feel any romantic feelings for you."

Equality
"The big one in my experience is if they're dressed down or ""scrubbing"". 9/10 times, my view on a woman is improved if she's just in jeans and a hoodie or something comfortable Vs being all dolled up. The hair and makeup don't have to be perfect, either. Most guys do love it when their girl gets dressed up... once in a while. But we still find you beautiful / sexy / awesome when you're just comfortable and being you."
She's seeing everything she thinks she ought to do but doesn't want to do. It makes her feel bad because she can't ignore it now that it's in her face.
"Wits. A woman who can challenge me in a discussion or is quick to respond in kind to a quip is a woman I want to spend more time with.

"I have tried to compliment men and that has been mistaken for flirting. So I literally only ever compliment guys that I'm close friends with and they know that it's only a compliment and nothing else. And now that you put it that way, it kind of makes sense but still I can't risk complimenting a guy I know and being mistaken for flirting. "
OP has never touched the opposite sex in that way.

"I had a fuck buddy who got kind of insecure about her weight because I was all about calorie counting and mainting a solid 6 pack. She kept asking whether I thought she was ""too fat"". I kept telling her that 1, if you've got a flat stomach you aren't fat and 2, just because I want abs doesn't mean I care whether a girl has them. It took a while for her to believe me and finally drop it. "
"Yo, man

Yo

You let her catch you?

I don't know how I let this happen

With what?

The meat cravers pan crust, you know?

Man

I don't know what to do

Say it wasn't you

Alright

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed

Creeping with the extra cheese pizza

Picture this, I was black out drunk

Passed out on the bathroom floor

How could I forget

That I had been on a low carb diet

All this time she was standing there

She never took her eyes off me

How you can grant the woman access to your villa

Trespasser and a witness while you chowing on your pizza

You better watch your back before she turn into a killer

Best for you and the situation not to call the beaner

To be a true diet cheater you have to know how to cheat

If she say you're not, convince her say you're not hungry

Never admit to a word when she say

Makes a claim and you tell her, baby, no way

But she caught my pizza on the counter

It wasn't me

Saw me eating on the sofa

It wasn't me

I even had stuffed crust in the shower

It wasn't me

She even caught me on camera

It wasn't me

She saw the cheese on my shoulder

It wasn't me

Heard the order I called in 

It wasn't me

Heard the delivery guy at the door 

It wasn't me

She stayed until it was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed

Eating with my high school friends

Picture this the box was empty

Laying on the bathroom floor

I had tried to keep her from

What she was about to see

Why should she believe me

When I told her it wasn't me

I havent cheated on my current gf of three years and am not planning to, but back then it was just *nothing* to me. I fucked another woman, so what? That was seriously my fucked up mindset.

I still live with the guilt. What fucks me up the most is that I find it hard to trust women nowadays. Eventhough my girlfriend has given me no reason to think shes being unfaithful, I still wonder and worry, every time she goes out.

When you have banged taken women and fucked women while you were taken, you kinda lose faith in people and think that everyone is as fucked up as you are. 

I accept this as my punishment for past actions though. I deserve it.

"You're too hung up on the stripper aspect. The reality is, a bachelor(ette) party is just whatever you want to make of it, whether it involves naked women, a sunny day at the golf course with your best friends, or anything in between.

When kids eventually arrive, some friendships are gone forever. The *real* ""loss of freedom"" isn't losing the ability to get a handy in the VIP room, it's being able to get your friends all in one place for a day/night/weekend out on the town because as time goes on, it gets less and less frequent.

"It's an excuse for cheating . . . on your low-carb diet.

People on a low carb diet should be aware that when eating low carb, the liver needs to constantly supply the body with glucose.  Drinking heavily causes the liver's production of glucose to slow, which can result in low blood sugar.  This is exacerbated if people on low carb diets are taking medications to control glucose levels.

If you know someone on a glucose-lowering drug or low-carb diet who is drinking heavily, be sure to watch out for signs of low blood sugar.  These include sweating, nervousness, shakiness, and confusion.  Shakiness should be of particular note, as it's distinguishable from drunkenness.  

It's always a good idea to, if you have a low carb intake, consume at least a small amount of carbs with alcohol, or limit you alcohol intake.  Beer is actually a good choice, as it has a little bit of carbs built in."

"I don't really. I just tell my girlfriend my thoughts on it, but ensure her it's her friend and I wouldn't want to break them off because they were so close. It's her friend, not mine.

My girlfriend doesn't take anything she says to heart though about us and she's actually more hurt at her suggestions. The way I see it, if your girlfriend is really serious about you, she'll defend the relationship even if the bff challenges it.

In our case, the single bff is upset because she wants to spend time with me. When my gf was single, she'd hang out with the bff 24/7 but now we share that time. Again, since the bff is single she also wants to do things that a lot of single girls would group up and go out to do. My girlfriend started saying no to this because she feels it's wrong since she is with me, even if it's only to help her find a guy.

It's just a bit more difficult because from what my gf has told me, she's the type to just have FWBs so never held a real relationship. Shes probably criticizing the time my gf spends with me because all she has really known is FWB booty calls. She actually fell for a FWB too but was rejected. I think because of her experience with relationships she doesn't understand that our relationship requires a lot more effort than just being fuck buddies."
"If I still want to have sex with her, we're all good.  If I don't, there's no relationship there.

To answer another of your questions:

&gt;What if she's actively working on changing? Not worth it?

I've dated some serial dieters.  While I keep my diet clean 99% and exercise religiously, I'd rather date somebody with extra weight than date somebody chronically trying to lose weight.  It's endlessly frustrating.  I do cuts/bulks.  I know my TDEE, I cut 700-800 calories of that out per day, plan out my meals, never allow an excuse to exercise, and I'll drop 2 lbs per week.  After having come home to crying about being fat and having to cancel plans to console her, then next week seeing pints of icecream on the shopping list?  Fuck that.  Nope.  Not again.  Do or do not.  


If on the other hand she's successfully changing, then yes by all means I'll date her.  But the fad/yo-yo dieting, the excuses, the crying?  That I will not.  "

That means you should put the effort in to look nice and to keep your place reasonably clean as *normal* behavior, not special behavior.

"One of the worst things about working nights was that people never understood the concept of time shifting no matter how much I explained it to them. For about 6 months, I was working 8pm to 8am on a temporary assignment that was paying almost twice as much as my regular role would have. I would get home around 8:30am, eat breakfast, shower, and then go to sleep around 9:30am.

I had friends and family members who knew about my schedule, but still came over to bother me and wake me up at all hours of the day. They would never understand why I got so pissed to hear them knocking on my door or shaking me awake at 2pm.

In their opinion, ""You slept in enough, and it's time to get your lazy ass out of bed"" or ""Oh, must be nice to just sleep your day away and not need to go to work in the morning""

Fuck that, it's not a hard concept. Take my schedule and swap PM and AM. If you wake me up at 2PM, that is the equivalent of me coming over to your house and waking you up at 2AM. Wouldn't you be pissed?

I never understood why people couldn't comprehend this concept."

"See, I wouldn't date an ass hole. Even if they were working on changing. I don't like ass holes, I don't want to be around one, I don't want to date one. Not even one who claims to be changing. Same idea. Maybe she's working super hard to lose that weight and I appreciate and admire that because I've been through it myself. But at the end of the day, I'm not attracted to fat girls. And I don't want to put up with a quality I don't like in someone in hopes that they will change. You don't date someone to change them or in hope that they will change. That's why so many relationships end and so much cheating happens is because people change or change each other. You date someone who is right now exactly who you want to be with."

People's jaw dropped and they all just stood still, leaving whatever they were doing for later. It can wait. I first tried to resist, but as soon as it uncovered, I was weak in my knees (mainly because of the marathons I've been running). I touched the first slice, it was as pleasant as I last remembered. It was steamy and moist at first. Then the rest went down in less than 2 minutes."

I absolutely would date a slender woman, though. I cook and bake very well, so regardless of your build, if you're dating me, you're going to gain weight.

"There is this girl that I am ""friends"" with on FB, she grew up across the street from me, but I haven't seen her IRL since I was in HS (so... 16 years ago) Apparently she spent some time as one of those girls that dresses in next-to-nothing and serves alcohol at certain events, usually with ""Bacardi"" or something written on her ass. Then she became a body-paint model, where people would actually paint a ""shirt"" onto her and she'd spend the night essentially topless. But the stream of constant drama that she posts is the only real reason she's still on my ""friends"" list. It's like watching all of your favorite day-time TV shows with more realistic characters. The most recent bit of drama jet-fuel was when her BF dumped her (for cheating on him). She's been able to milk that one for WEEKS."

"When I'm lonely and that sense of being ""distant"" from society, being isolated from everyone, it hits me hard.

My social side becomes distorted, I feel like I become socially awkward, afraid, irritable, and I get easily annoyed by things. I become extremely defensive, i have negative expectations towards everything, I start developing really bad habits and weird ideas towards a lot of things. 

I become dissatisfied with casual social interactions, I become self defeated, self conscious, and less cooperative, and less helpful. 

That desire, that need to be connected with someone in a personal, intimate level hits me hard. So, my body reacts weirdly, like it wants me to satisfy this need, this want, but my brain says ""how?"" So, I start feeling anxious, then anxiety appears. Self loathing, self hate, self doubt starts appearing in my head. I start getting depressed because I feel so isolated, so unloved, so alone. 

It's a horrible feeling and doing things like hanging out with friends and family never seems to resolve anything. You enjoy yourself, you enjoy being with them.. but, you still go home alone, you still wake up in the mornings alone. Texting some random person seems like a hassle, and their lack of effort in talking to you also ruins that ""satisfaction"" in talking to someone.

Loneliness sucks and by nature we are built to be a social group. We're require  to feel connected and loved."

"Short answer:

My happiness and kids aren't compatible. I'll pick my happiness.

Long answer:

All the things I deeply value about my life - spare time; self-actualization; creative hobbies; a loving, close, physically intimate relationship with a girlfriend (not: ""a mom""); the ability to unwind from a very stressful job in peace and quiet; spontaneity; precious objects not broken, vomited or crayon-painted upon; a good night's sleep; etc - are deeply antithetical to what children need and are like.

I don't want to swap my soulmate and lover and muse for a stress-racked, sexless mommy,  I don't want to put her through the ordeal of pregnancy and birth, I don't want to swap my spare time for babysitting, my much-needed sleep for sleepless nights, and so on and so forth.

The only appeal I find in kids is in making them, and those few minutes aren't worth the years that would follow."

As much as women can be made uncomfortable by men moving too fast, they can also *lose* interest in a man who moves too slowly. If she invites you up for coffee, and you decline, you never get a second chance. Men have to balance the two risks against each other, and that means initiating as soon as he thinks you are ready.

If a guy likes you, and he thinks that patience would be a better approach, then he would be doing that. If there's been a misunderstanding, consider that your behavior might be part of it."

"You may have seen the articles floating around about how Millenials are killing chain restaurants like Applebee's and Buffalo Wild Wings. It seems to me like it's mostly the older generations who like chain restaurants, because they value consistency over novelty.

If you go to an Applebee's in Iowa, they're using the same recipes, ingredients, equipment and training manuals as an Applebee's in Maine or California, and corporate's controlling that all pretty tightly. And it's all designed for mass market, so you can pretty much walk into any chain restaurant, anywhere in the country, and be reasonably sure you'll get an ok meal and ok service at a decent price.

Personally, I don't typically go to chain restaurants unless it's my mom's idea. I've had some really amazing meals at locally owned places, and a few ""this was not worth what I paid for it,"" meals. There was one local diner my friends and I used to frequent where recipes seemed to change constantly, so we'd typically order the same thing week to week, but we might have a salad made differently because there's a new cook, or management decided to use steak fries instead of beer battered fries that week."

"The fundamental flaw of The Nice Guy^^^TM is that they think that being nice is a means to an end, not a genuine thing.

Genuinely nice guys *do* have lots of success with women, and The Nice Guy^^^TM sees that and goes no farther.  They don't consider that perhaps the other guys out there are funny, charming, socially functional or capable of being extroverted.  They don't see that them being nice isn't the sole reason why they have their significant other/general success with girls.  The Nice Guy^^^TM thinks that being nice is an action that requires a reward.  If you are a nice guy to a lady, if you do nice things for a lady, she must respond like so.  That's why so many The Nice Guy^^^TM have breakdowns when their niceness isn't reciprocated how they want and why they typically suffer an extreme personality shift and start flinging insults at the poor girl in question.

That is a result of them thinking that, if this girl doesn't like nice guys, she must like assholes.  While there are some women out there drawn to assholes, they are still missing the point.

The fact that a man is nice or an asshole is not the singular defining aspect of their character.  Most relationships are forged out of things like common interests, physical attraction, confidence, chemistry, humor and yes, kindness.  But it's a mix of all of those things, and no two people probably take their mix the exact same.  Some people may hold kindness in very high regard.  Others may not care as much.  Some do actually go for 'the bad boy/girl' or assholes because it's attractive to them.

The Nice Guy^^^TM thinks that if he is nice, he will be repaid with a relationship.  That it is the only pre-requisite to getting a girlfriend.  Treat a girl nice and she'll love you.  Now factor in that most The Nice Guy^^^TM do not have very high social skills (we can assume, given that they think being nice is a suitable category to picking a mate) and you see the stereotype of the fumbly awkward guy trying to be nice, unaware of the social blunders he's making, unaware that he needs more than just superficial or even genuine kindness to make himself capable of attracting a mate, emerge.

It is the belief that ""I would treat her right, and I'm a nice guy so that's all that should count"" clashing with the reality that attraction is complicated and that while treating a person right and being nice are admirable, they are not the end all be all and can't make up for a lack of attraction due to other deficiencies of personality."

I got over it by just getting really slutty with it when I was single. Had a year of that, met someone new (stayed faithful) which lasted 3 years, ended that, had another mad spell, then was ready to settle down. Met my wife at 30, been with her 5 years and never been close to cheating. "

So either they desperately want someone really manly (what when combined with previous point, may end up in a disaster) or because they were raised with only single women around they might believe men are evil/there to “get her” so they avoid men or look for someone extremely agreeable.

"I wouldn't repeat the gossip, especially if it's from an ex gf. It'll just erode any credibility you have when bringing up objections.

You can bring it up in a round about way - first ask if he's serious about her? If he says he's not, then leave it alone.

If he has serious intentions then ask if he's SURE he wants a girl who only knows how to do the ""sexy baby"" act? What's going to happen when you're all out of your 20s? The sexy baby act only works with youth, and it gets old FAST. 

And if he's in denial about who and what she is, also leave it alone. You'll lose the friend and even if they do break up, he still might not be friends again. And if they do become more serious, it's going to be super awkward.

Light touch is the way to go. "

No, fucksticks, my wife got an education that allows her to earn a living wage with flexible hours, thus she goes to work when I get home.  Also, economic realities dictate our work schedules.

It's like the feminist blogger/writer that got sick of unsolicited dick pics, so she started sending unsolicited vag pics, assuming that surely guys would be just as put off as she was by the dick pics. Much to her surprise, the guys were definitely not put off (well, most of them at least).

I've found it makes the whole process less nerve racking which has boosted my confidence "
"As a woman who barely to never gets compliments, I think this is pretty accurate.

Just recently I had this random drunk (this was unmistakable, considering the can of beer and sway in his step) sort of blurt a random compliment about my looks as we passed each other on the street. A woman who gets a lot of attention would probably consider it catcalling, but I was feeling like shit that day and I, honest to god, never get much feedback on how I look. It made my day regardless of the fact that he was not all in the right state of mind, barely able to speak audibly as it is.

I do understand women who get *too* much attention though. I imagine that at some point you can't really distinguish the powerplay from the genuine remarks, plus you probably start feeling like people are constantly watching your every move. As someone who really enjoys her anonymous invisibility in the streets, I'd get paranoid quick."
"Yeah, I find it hard to forgive myself though, because every woman Ive cheated on has never given me a reason to.

That has always stuck with me, rightfully so.

Sure, I'm not a murderer or someone who drowns kittens, but cheating on someone who loves you with all of their heart is a very shitty thing.

From asking them about it, it seems like it's mostly marketing.  They see the commercials on TV.  They see the restaurants on every major shopping street in town.  They get coupons in the mail for them.  And the prices are ""cheap"".  And the quality is consistent.

They don't like going to the hole in the wall restaurants I eat at all the time if only because ""I never heard of it.""  And for fear of it being expensive.  I actively seek out smaller places because I have friends who either own those businesses or cook at them.  People overreact to arbitrary shit like having your burger served on a cutting board.

"I got lucky.

I met an old friend and a friend's wedding. We'd always been flirty, but we were both dating other people, so nothing happened. Looked her up on FB, and we kept in touch.

Blah blah blah, several months later, we were both single. Started flirtatious texting and chatting on the phone. We lived in separate cities, but I was coming home (to her town) for Christmas. We made plans to have dinner a couple days later.

Great date and we ended up having a couple-week fling while I was in town. We continued to chat and flirt, and she came to visit me once a couple months later. Great girl, really liked her, but living 1500 miles apart with no way to resolve that issue really put a damper on things, so we broke up.

I tried to date afterwards. I lived in the middle of nowhere, which made for slim pickings. Nothing. I tried, but the few dates I went on were less than interesting.

I was convinced I was going to die alone. I basically gave up dating, figuring either a woman would fall into my lap (estimating a 0.00000001% chance on that one) or I would die alone. I was OK with either option.

One day, I happened to catch a movie (""Easy A"") on TV that I had seen with that girl. I sent her a text saying something like ""I'm watching Easy A on TV right now and loving it - thought of you.""

That opened up communications. We started chatting. As life happened to work out, she was moving within a 4-hour drive of me. And I had quit my job, so I had time. Then my grandmother died and I flew home for the funeral. We starting hooking up again.

Two years (to the very day) after our first date, we got married. Shortly thereafter, I told her that if it didn't work out with her, I was just planning on dying alone. Her response?

""Lucky you."""

There's endless resources for learning online, though you'll find JustinGuitar most recommended - and for good reason, that man is a saint. If, after a while, you feel you're progressing and you know you want to stick with it, invest in a guitar with a more mid-tier cost.

Well...now this is cute.
"My hair. I know how my hair curls, which direction it flips, what type of shampoo gives me the longest time before it starts to look greasy and starts to mat down. I like having nice hair.

Even my facial hair. Do you know how long I spend shaving to make sure my beard and mustache don't look trashy? I can't even shave it off because then I look like a mutant 4 year old. Most men like to look good, even if it's just so people we don't know don't think we're dirty. Worst part is that there isn't much of a guide men have to follow on these things. My current knowledge stems from 24 years of trial and error."

"&gt; it's kind of offensive as if I'm only interested in her because she has a certain set of qualities and not because I saw her and just liked her out right. 

This is very confusing to me.  Is she really saying she'd PREFER that you judged her on first sight as opposed to her talents and personality?"
I dunno. I don't go to women only spaces because I'm not a woman.

"My ex did me really wrong and it took me awhile to function properly. It's been almost a year and some days are better than others. 

Most of what I miss are events with her, or sex with her, or great *memories* with her in them. 

The thing I try to keep in mind is whenever I remember those things, I'm probably missing the connection or sex or emotions more than I'm missing her. I haven't connected with anyone else yet like I have with her, so of course my mind will resort to thoughts of how good I felt in a relationship with her... Nobody ever remembers how really bad the bad days were in their old relationships. I assume this is why people who are abused sometimes go back to their abusers.

Getting back on track; she proved to me she wasn't that great of a person who doesn't deserve my attention or some of the good feelings I still have for her despite everything. 

You situation is different because it ended due to timing. But keep in mind the same things I just said. Are you really missing her, or are you just misisng that connection? Now I know you actually might miss her more due to how your relationship ended, but the truth is she's not the only girl who will ever make you feel that way. You just have to open yourself up to it. 

I honestly don't think people you really loved can ever be forgotten or not thought about from time to time. The experiences with them just make us more wise and we learn things we can carry on in life and future relationships.

**Edit**: I really appreciate the positive feedback this got! I hope it helped you too OP. I'm just a young guy who's trying to make sense of my situation in life, and who wanted to share my experience to help others. You guys help me out too. I know it's not easy moving on from somebody and even I have days where I take a step back. I don't like coming on here sounding like I know the secrets to getting over the loss of a relationship. I just say what I think. 

The hardest thing (but most helpful thing) to remember is that the future is what holds the key to your happiness, not the past. I know this might sound like it belongs on r/Im14andthisisdeep, but you'll never find what you're looking for by going over old memories in your head. Keep the feelings from those old memories as motivation to live life the way you want, so that you can feel those emotions again. Life is too short to reminisce for too long. "

"Great communities: 99.9% of IRL hobby communities

"What is then if it's not a hobby? I see a hobby as an enjoyable way to spend time where you don't get paid for. Why would reading be a hobby but watching a show isn't? Why would hiking be a hobby but shopping not?

I get that some hobbies are more low key and maybe more of a way to pass time than a deep interest or something you get complimented on, but I don't know why it can't be a hobby at all. A hobby doesn't have to be something great where you can learn things or make beautiful stuff or work out, I think the main point of hobbies is doing something you enjoy, having some downtime. One already has to get results when working or studying, if hobbies need to have a point to, then doesn't it become a highway to burnout town? (Or at least for those people who truely relax shopping, watching shows and socializing.)"

Being naked around a woman in a non-sexual way is peak compliment for me. There's something magical about completely letting your guard down, something I can only do with less than a handful of people.

You know when you're laying in bed with your head on her boobs and she's scratching your head and you're reading your kindle, neither of you talking, just happy in eachother's company? *That shit is magical*. "
"Being a gay guy: my partner really does not have the hips for it.

That small detail aside for the moment: looking at the situation most young people are in, in regards to housing, education and the like; you have to ask yourself: what will it be like in 20 years when they head off into the big wide world.  If you're finding it hard now, what about in 20 years?

I don't think its selfish to not have kids, but i'd rather help the ones that are already here who have had a shitty start to their life than bring another one into this world."
"In all honesty man it's more complicated. 

All the advice here is generally good. 

Cut off all communication lines. It's easier trust me.

Keep your mind busy, read, netflix, pick up a hobby, anything. 

Be true to your emotions. Sadness is normal, we are human. Don't suppress the sadness, don't try and mask it with happy things. 

Self reflect, think of what went wrong, what went right, and what you will want in your next relationship. 

Self improve: hit gym, get hobbies, advance career, etc are usually a positive way to react to your emotions. Focus on what you love about yourself, and what things you could improve. 

meditate: just try it a few times even if you think it wont work. 

Good luck friend. "

"You know it just dawned on me how weird this Reddit/internet thing is. We share really intimate details about ourselves, like I now know there a guy out there who's girlfriend likes her hair played with when she goes down on him. The most amazing thing is this is for the most part a good experience and more often than not people are generous when you share with them. 

Not an original thought but whatever. 

Edit: To make it clear I am saying this is a good thing we share "

"I play with her hair. It's not optional.

I'm ""allowed"" to take one hair away from her hair to, like, hold her hand. But if I ever take both hands out of her hair, I'll get one little warning growl or maybe a little play-bite, and if I don't quickly put my hand back where it belongs (in her hair) then she'll take me out of her mouth and stop. And not continue until I play with her hair again. 'cause she's pretty much addicted to having her hair petted / mussed up / played with."

"I have a friend who's incredibly left wing and feminist. I am as well to an extent, but she's radical. She's also incredibly intelligent, and very outspoken.

We were on the tram once and she was spieling about gender roles and how, even though women and men may be happy living those roles, they were still lead to think that was what would make them happy by society's expectations and their upbringing. Essentially ""if you've always been a slave, you might be happy just to have a kind master"". This isn't the place for that argument but understand that she's militant, very eloquent, and pretty much destroyed my position over the course of the argument.

We stopped having reached a conclusion and this old man chuckles, leans over from across the aisle, and says ""sounds like you've just experienced womansplaining"".

"Until I was about 32 years old, I played music and was in bands since the age of 17. One band lasted 11 years. 
  
I make a lot of art, painting &amp; drawing &amp; animation. I watch MMA and in my 30's turned the art &amp; MMA into a part time job writing a column and illustrating it.   
  
I cook, preferably for groups of people like roommates. I rode a bike everywhere. Went through stretches of reading books about jazz musicians and then collecting their music, and then saw lots of show, either of them or guys who played with them.   
  
Even though I liked dating, some of the best years were when I was not in a serious relationship because I got to make so much stuff. Home recordings, piano lessons, learning how to make 2d woodwork, editing band improv sessions.   
  
Also tons of dating. I'm 38, so I remember when craigslist and myspace were places you could contact a real person and go out with them on a date.   
  
I like to read books, the newspaper (in a park is best), see concerts (more when I was younger), and now that I've got a wife and kids I'd like to do different things like learn BJJ and how to dance.

"I know a girl who is dull as a sack of hammers who works for Goldman sachs. She is stunning hot, but I sometimes wonder how she string together sentences. I'm pretty sure she is a receptionist or somwthing, but I'm sure there are side benefits.

On the other hand I do know another woman who works for Goldman Sachs (completely unrelated in a separate state) who is a solid 8.5-9 PLUS is super smart, so she is destined for greatness.

It's not the stupid ones I notice as much, when you are in a competitive field with lots of qualified people, it's the hot ones who win. That hits home a bit 

Edit: When I said ""side benefits, I'm in no way making the assertion that she is sleeping with the wealthy men of the firm, but she does get to go on their boats, eat at nice restaurants etc with the company."

"A woman who calls herself a ""free spirit"" is like a man who calls himself a ""rebel.""

99% of the time it's a prettied-up rationalization for selfish impetuosity.

Actual free spirits and rebels in the positive sense don't label themselves that, because they don't identify with it.  It's just a part of who they are and they don't understand why everyone doesn't think that way.

Same with ""artist.""  My experience is that the frequency with which someone calls themselves an artist is inversely related to their skill and accomplishment in their art.  (Does not apply to people who actually make a living as artists, then it's a literal job title.)"
