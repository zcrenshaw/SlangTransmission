"Infuriating. ""I don't know how computers work, but I will argue with the experts every time."""
Got a job==no lifestyle changes?
"The thing I don't understand when people take this ""recycling"" name literally is when you throw a plastic bottle into your recycling bin you still never expect to see it again."
"Reminds me of my old CEO:

&gt; CEO: How do I get this system to work with *{Government systems}*?

&gt; ME: Log in to their database via the web page and change the system status from Inactive to Active. The system will work on our end, but their systems will ignore any traffic from it until it's made Active.

&gt; CEO: Won't that trigger their billing system to start charging us for it?

&gt; ME: Yes? We'll be using it, so I would expect so.

&gt; CEO: How do I get this system to work without them charging us?

&gt; ME: You mean, ""how do I defraud the Government?""

&gt; CEO: What? No, I just want this to work!

&gt; ME: Without paying for it?

&gt; CEO: Yeah!

&gt; ME: So you're asking how to configure our system so that you can use their PAID service without incurring any charges. Even if you find a way to do so, it's deliberately circumventing their payment systems, and I'm pretty sure that's fraud.

&gt; CEO: Oh.

Somehow, he was convinced it was a good idea. In retrospect, I should have let him run with it. It may have killed the company, but at least it would have been a quick, painless death; rather than being slowly strangled by an incompetent and border-line criminal Chief Executive."
"I love that idea of the ""duh"" tax.  I wish we could implement that where I work."
"You think that's bad, I've had customers verbally agree to wiping their hard drives so I could reinstall Windows, sign a form to the same effect, and still say ""Where are my files?"" after I gave their computers back to them.  We asked you if you wanted us to back up your files before wiping the hard drive, and you said no.  It's not my fault that you're dumb."
"This is why I quit $ElectronicsRetailStore. 

I had major issues with the way we were pushed to handle customer repairs. I can understand not wanting to lose money, but not only were we well in the black, but they actually decided to promote a guy into the empty manager position (costing them an additional 4k a month) that was effectively nothing more than just another paper pusher (who actually ended up costing us a bunch of money just by being an idiot towards customers). 

Tech support will NEVER be a major profit center unless you want to drive off all the customers. There will always be some kid in high school willing to do for 50 bucks what your boss wants you to charge 500 for. "
She probably hung up to call Microsoft. 
You just described every single interaction I have with one specific person. 
"Oh god, imagine if one of the tabs had an autoplay ad so you to check each one to try and find the commercial"
"""Yeah, go ahead and delete everything. Nah, don't back anything up, it's fine.""


""What the Hell? You deleted all my files!"""
"""I only won the lottery, got married, flew to the Moon but you know that's totally not a lifestyle change"""
"I feel like there's a point where you're morally obligated to blast people about how they view technology.

An equivalent failure in just about any other field gets treated differently, IT? Nah, definitely the techies fault.

The only one I've seen really getting close is mechanics and bad drivers, your car broke down? Probably has nothing to do with the way you drive like a pile of cats, definitely theechanic fixing it wrong.

I mean, let's book her problem down here, *something that had previously worked for her, now did not work.*

Equivalent issues in other fields? Your keys don't work, your car doesn't turn on, your power isn't working.

What does she do? She goes to the people responsible for keeping the tech working, under the regulations of their superiors.

In equivalent issues? You don't blame the locksmiths for making shitty keys, you double check you're using the right key. You don't blame the manufacturer for building cars that break down (well sometimes, but it's your fault if you bought a car from maufacturer like that), you ring mechanic (or do it yourself if you know how) and see if something's broken. You don't blame the electric company, you check your breaker box.

So what would they do if they treated IT like other fields? I'm not entirely sure since there isn't one single, catchall 'most of the problems' check you can do, at least not on the same broad scale as other things, but probably something like ""Hey, IT person who I'm admitting knows more than me about this technology by the very fact that I'm coming to you for help, this thing that used to work for me now doesn't work for me. Do you know why?""

And then if the IT guy says ""actually, those laptops aren't allowed to connect to wifi networks outside of work"" they'd still probably go off at them, but if we keep this idea of treating IT like they treat other fields, the techie would then be able to blame corporate and it'd be done with."
"&gt; without having to rotate it or anything

And that's how you know it's not a USB port"
"""You know how the janitor empties your recycling bin at night? That's what happens with your computer. Don't put stuff you want to keep in the recycling bin."""
"&gt;THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BOX THAT EXPLAINS HOW TO CONNECT THE SCREEN, I GOT THE KEYBOARD AND MOUSE IN BUT THERE'S NOTHING FOR THE SCREEN!

That's the scary bit, he plugged the Keyboard and Mouse into what I can assume were the network ports on the modem, I was afraid they might have damaged the ports and you wouldn't be able to refund them."
"Wow. Shows that tech support can be mundane, but there's always situations that are anything but mundane. Great job making sure she was ok, and following up later was a very nice touch.

Now if you'll excuse me, I think the TFTS ninjas just put onions in my case fans."

Edit: by far my highest comment now lol"
"""damnit, I don't understand why you IT people do this to me! I'm just trying to use the laptop to access the Bing, I need the Google Bing to work. Why do I have to plug in my laptop, I thought it was wireless!!"" - Google Bing Lady"
Wtf? What did the boss say when yo told him? 
"He laughed.  That sort of thing happens around there, we are used to users getting odd off the wall issues.  "
"Yep. Did we have an automated backup tool with the ability to download just specific folders, or specific databases, out of your account, instead of downloading an entire account backup? Yep, that'll be $12. Just a dollar a month! But I can also show you how to use the File Manager and Databases tools to export and download the exact same stuff for free... I hated feeling pressure to *not* tell them about how they could do things our ""premium tools"" did without having to pay extra."
"&gt;It may have killed the company, but at least it would have been a quick, painless death; rather than being slowly strangled by an incompetent and border-line criminal Chief Executive.

I see you used to work where I currently work.

About 5 different people decided that they were all going to take vacation days tomorrow. So I'm just not going to show up."
"I always loved the ""I can't log in!"" calls.

Then, when you get to your desk, you just point and ask, ""does that look like your name?"""
"It boggles my mind how many calls I took at likely the same company, that were the same situation. Logic isn't a strong suit of many people, I learned. "
"&gt;Her: So you're trying to tell me I shouldn't have even bought this lamp?

Okay, how did you keep a straight face at that point? It's the perfect non-sequitur that absolutely puts the cherry on top of this absurdity sundae. "
Heaven help you if you said you were going to burn it in.
"For anyone who didn't see this on the news when it originally happened: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanwings_Flight_9525

Tl;dr version: A German airliner pilot suffering from some form of mental illness, but afraid to seek treatment for fear of losing his job, eventually suffered a complete breakdown and deliberately crashed an airliner with a hundred and fifty people onboard into a mountain."
"Let's be honest here, there are definitely people out there that do blame the locksmith for their using the wrong key and blame the car manufacturer for them bagging the crap out of their car. Also wish I could give you double the upvotes for ""drive like a pile of cats""."
"Since this is such a critical error, you need to install screen recording software so you can pinpoint exactly when this error is occurring, obviously.  

Which will *magically* make the error go away, and everything will work fine.  

Tldr;  Schrodinger's network error."
"For $1000 you could've got his charging port fixed, and plugged in one of the awful charging back things."
"Files?  Go ahead - I don't really file anything, I just leave everything on the desktop."
"If the doors can crush a laptop, they can crush a hand.  That elevator is a serious safety hazard."
Your formatting is great. I learned this issue the hard way dealing with my mom... and my father-in-law... and my mother-in-law...
"USB A will actually perfectly fit into RJ-45, without having to rotate it or anything.

Speaking from experience (both from having customers do it, and accidentally doing it a time or two myself)."
We really should just change its name to trash can/incinerator
"&gt;even though I have plugged in my headset

&gt;our IT person didn't plug it in 

I'll never stop being impressed by their mental gymnastics."
"I wonder if there is a web site somewhere that has pictures of various failed hard drives.

Your ""disk with jelly and fingerprints"" would probably rank up near the top."
"Ring ring ring...

Hello, IT. 

bla bla bla...

Have you tried turning it off and back on again?

Bla bla bla, it works now. 

"
"Yeah he had plugged them into the RJ-45 ports, but there were just some minor scratches on the shielding from it, so no damage done :)"
It's a stability test carried out over a period of time. 
"What's a ""soak test""?  I've never heard the term before."
"For $1000 OP could've bought an S7 Edge, a wireless charger, *and* put the change towards a coffee. "
"He/she just described an interaction I had with an old coworker who thought our outsourced internal help desk knew more than me, who worked in field services. "
"Story checks out, user is at fault... blames IT"
"If any manager had called you out on the length of that call, you'd have been justified in running around the office shouting very loudly ""X DIDN'T WANT ME TO TALK TO A SUICIDAL PERSON BECAUSE OUR BOTTOM LINE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN A LIFE!

SAVE YOURSELVES - WE WORK IN HELL!"""
"The silence issue is awful... We've got users who put in tickets, we respond within minutes sometimes, and get nothing back. We wait a few days and then close the ticket.  
It gets even worse when it's a manager opening a ticket for another employee, because they just send it in and expect it to be resolved.  
Fucking users, not understanding that tickets are a method of tracked communication to aid in our continuity of issues."
Also called a stress test 
"I had similar experiences at 2 jobs. 

The first was an ISP known for telling you that you have mail. I was hired for tech support, then told in training that not only were we supposed to try to get callers to stay on the line after us for a 3rd party sales pitch, but we also were going to be split between the tech queue and the member retention queue! Guess what, that means you can make lots of commission if you talk people out of canceling their service! In the 5th and last week of training, after seeing one guy who should have been a sleazy car salesman bully some old lady into staying, and another guy get praised for convincing a caller to stay when he'd called to cancel because he literally had WEEKS to live due to cancer, I told my trainer I wasn't having it. He had me meet with a manager, who asked me what it would take to get me to stay. I said put me in tech only like I was told when I interviewed. His response was to try and sell me on WHY I SHOULD STAY. I noped out on the spot, see ya. 

The second was as outsourced (US-based) support for a HaPpy OEM PC manufacturer. Not long into our contract, we were told we had to start pitching sales. Naturally, no numbers were good enough for them. Thankfully I was exempt as a senior rep who only handled escalations, but it was almost a relief when they killed our contract here and replaced us with cheaper workers in their Canadian call centers. 

Sales people are hired to make sales, leave us techs the f**k alone, eh? "
"The first story doesn't sound soo bad, at least in this story. I mean he sounds respectful if a bit lost. It sounds like the DM has grown up around phones a lot. "
Someone is in for a lawsuit. 
"&gt; Turns out the $20 wasn’t unique, it was a thing in the office where if you forgot to ask the most fundamental of questions you get ‘fined’, and the person who calls you on it gets $20.

Aww. I wish my company or hell even my department had something like this 😩"
"He was probably planning on taking over the world with those RAMs. Congrats, you prevented a supervillain. "
"We have something like that as well, the bavarian veal sausage tax. I work at an MSP so we deal with a lot of different machines and customers, as well as of course monitoring. If you do something dumb like configuring monitoring checks on a friday before leaving, and it alerts the hotline (team members, on rotation) over the weekend, you have to buy veal sausages for the whole team."
"Before I upgraded his ram, I would have insisted that the extension to mute background tabs was installed. (IIRC, Chrome now won't let tabs autoplay when opened without focus)"
"No, no. It deescalated quickly. God I feel bad saying that."
You'd actually want 429: Too Many Requests. 509 Limit Exceeded could also work. 
"Tough to see that icon when there's hundreds of tabs open, though."
You stay grounded even when visiting the moon.  Truly humble.  
"It amazes me how people who know absolutely nothing want to argue every step of the damn way and get frustrated when it doesn't get done because they don't let you do it because they won't fucking stop arguing. 

I just wonder if you know more than the people who are paid to know these things then why are you calling us? "
"He's probably the least respectful in the building and that's why we dislike him so much. But you're right this time it was more funny than anything else.

I had a good laugh about it. What's baffling me is that sometimes he tells me he has such and such video card in his gaming pc his son built for him, yet he thinks the CD ROM eject button is the power. 

He's not mean but he refuses to make an effort."
"Probably looking at your website and right-click-&gt;set as desktop background.

Probably done as a user spaz attack where she had no idea what she was doing and was just clicking like mad."

"For $1000 dollars, I could run away so $Fd can't track me down, and blow it on a bounty to unlock bootloader on the Snapdragon S7 so *I* can run a custom theme.

(I got a little too r/android there)"
"We had a guy return an expensive camera, and then a few minutes later he attempted to purchase the discounted open box that his return would create.

We had a nice long conversation about the ethics and legality of that, with me ambiguously threatening that we would know if he managed it. He would have continued to attempt it if I hadn't ditched the customer service approach and told him up front that it is an honest to God crime and legitimately considered fraud.

He seriously thought that he'd just found a loophole and it was totally cool to take advantage of it. As far as I can tell, the lesson actually stuck, so his was just a case of naivete coupled with perceived cleverness.

Also, Sergey, if you're reading this, I totally lied about the 24hr delay before returns become open box. But now it actually *is* store policy."
Electricity is hard mkay
"""Then why don't you just right click on it and empty it to get your stuff out?""  
My inner masochist wants to see how that would play out."
"And what sucks is that even if tech support is the main reason people go with a particular company, it rarely gets credited to that department.

""95% of our customers say high quality tech support is the main reason they went with us... Good job marketing team for advertising that!  Support team, why can't you be more like marketing?"""
How about File Deleter Thingy? That should be sufficiently technical for most users.
"My biggest pet peeve is how everyone blames wifi assist ... probably because mashable wrote an article (or one of those snap story things) saying something like ""Why your data usage has gone up on iOS"" and said it was because of wifi assist "

The youngest person thing is great until they get a facebook/apple user instead of an engineer.
"The doctor told him to get help but legally couldn't tell the airline, if I recall correctly... "
"If it was, you wouldn't have a job. 80% of tech support calls are for things an experienced user could fix in five minutes flat or just google..."
"How the fuck is this still a thing.  The recycling bin has existed for decades, and it has always had the same purpose.

My God "
Schrodinger's USB
"It's rough when they won't acknowledge that maybe, just maybe, they typed the password wrong.

I had a lady swear she couldn't log in remotely over VPN at home. I asked that she show me in the office to test the case. She went through the motions and upon typing username and password, it popped up an error. ""See, that's what it does at home"". I asked her to type it in again, even though she explicitly told me she knows her password, BOOM! Logged in.

Passwords man, they're so tricky!"
I HATE people who make software like that. People who make stuff that only runs in IE should be taken around back and beaten over the head with a clue by four.
I once had a computer that was failing to boot because of a cheap knock-off wireless mouse USB receiver.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS CHROME I USE YAHOO
"Pretty sure I work for the same company you did. I hate that too. Luckily, the sales aren't pressured here in the soon-to-close location. "
"Seems a shitty system if it doesn't just ignore the device after a few tries, also why does the USB fan have the data lines active? Should just be the power ones."
"I couldn't believe it. Like, did he think I wasn't going to be able to piece it together? And if he had installed it and it froze again, I was going to see it was back? What was he going to say? ""Oh, it just installed itself!""

Actually, yeah, he probably would."
"&gt; About 5 different people

Only if they greatly expanded the team after I left.  
Then again, as I was singlehandedly doing the work of a team of seven or eight people, it's not entirely unfeasible."
