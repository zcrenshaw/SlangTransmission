get da fuck outta there and never look back IMO 
"Advice from an old man who's first wife cheated on him when he was away fighting the Taliban. It's not about you and the wife, do whats right for your children. That being said you will never be able to look her in the same way you had before. You will never be able to trust her, even if you say or think you can. You have the upper hand, you know more than she does at this point. Don't tell her you know until you have figured out what YOU want to do.
"
I hate to be rude but can y'all stop sending perverse sex questions to my inbox? AMA doesn't mean hit on a disabled person because you have some weird fetish.
"not a Q, just a comment.

Was having a conversation the other day with a work mate who thinks that ""we missed out"" on the opportunities that Tinder gives todays generation...

I suspect its the other way around. The hardest part of ""finding someone"" isnt the actual finding.. its the developing the skills to connect with them.

Back before there was Tinder we had to build up these skills in person rather than through an arbitrary swiping app.

I'd recommend you get involved in something. Local gaming group? Repertory club?  Hiking group? anything that takes the focus from ""him and you"" to the lot of you at some other focal point.

The rest will just flow..."
"Convincing a scammer to travel 3k kilometers in search of money. I can guarantee that he was unable to scam while he was away from home.

ETA: I am also proud of my tattoo. There is a man on this planet that has a very ugly tattoo. We convinced a scammer that he would need to have a tattoo to join us in making money. "
They aren't even my BLOOD children... They are hers from a previous marriage.
"Would you consider yourself to be, *ahem*, a master baiter? "

"Whatever you decide, please DO NOT resort to violence. 
I know you are pissed as hell. I know you want to hurt her / him. Just go to the local hospital and wait in the waiting room. Watch the TV in there, and from time to time actually try and take notice of the shows playing - try and calm down, taking your mind off the pain.
When the bank opens, open a new account and transfer 50% of the family savings into it. 
Stay away from home. Stay away from home. Stay away from home - until you are calm and in control. Even then go home when the girls are at school, and make sure you take a witness with you who can both keep you in check, as well as vouch for everything that happens at home.
I feel for you mate. It sucks."
"The Christmas truce of 1914. During WWI,
It's never been repeated, and even in the middle of war and battle, two opposing forces took a break from killing each other to exchange cigarettes and pudding. They also helped carry the deceased across the battlefield. A moment in time when humanity could look passed their disagreement and enjoy their lives. 
"
Would you share a picture of yourself with us?
"My advice is simple. You have only one life to live. Accept who you are for who you are and where you've been. Love the life you live, and live it to your fullest! :)"
"do whats in your heart but overall i agree with this dude
"
"It's hard to identify a specific situation. You're probably expecting a situation with an extremely violent patient, or similar. But it's nothing like that. It's going to work knowing you'll lack the resources necessary to do the job. Personnel, equipment, rooms, beds. If we were a cancer unit, or anything to do with kids, we'd have it all. But mental health is the black sheep. You get hand-me-down equipment, if you get anything at all. You get skeleton staffing. And endless ridiculous administrative additions to your shift duties, to the point where you don't have time to adequately assess you patients. You really have no idea what's going on with your patients. You get inappropriate admissions up the yingyang, and psychiatrists who don't give 2 shits about anything but their billing. That's a short-list of the worst. But those are not isolated circumstances. That's just every shift."
That's a great question. my experience with zelda leads me to rather fight a 100 ft chicken. 
"Jesus... Is this really a ""phobia"" or just a normal response to ""GOD people are assholes?"""
"It is.

My younger brother and I were abandoned in Korea by our biological mother, and I was his main caregiver at the age of 3, until our father came home from assignment overseas. We were left with our grandmother when our father left for work overseas again, but our grandmother abused us, so our father would come home and would drop us off at the orphanage on more than one occasion. We were sent to the United States alone to live with family for a while. That family was abusive and were alcoholics. 

However, this did not affect my romantic relationships _as_ _badly_ until after my first husband had an affair, and my next long-term boyfriend cheated, getting his sidechick pregnant. It caused issues in my third long-term relationship, and when that ended (again due to cheating), I went on 204 first dates in a year and a half.

Now I am working with a therapist while trying to maintain a 10-month relationship."
"Yes, this sounds fascinating. If it's allowed, you might want to let the folks in r/linguistics know beforehand as well. They might be interested, too."
I will give you an upvote for the attempt.But that is an extremely tired pun in our world.
"Have you discussed that with any of them? Without knowing your reasons, a reluctance to have sex after a few dates would just make me think you're not romantically or sexually interested in me. It's not a judgment, but a natural assumption. For a lot of people from non religious backgrounds, sexual compatibility is a normal part of the dating evaluation. Yeah, some assholes will think of you as a conquest and just try to pump you and dump you, but others may just be sexually attracted to you without any malicious motives. Some will stay and some will leave, but how would you know without trying? 

Or are you holding out till marriage for religious reasons? Can't fault you for that, but most people our age will find that archaic and silly, limiting your prospects."
"Made a scammer believe that he had to join an elite organization. This involved getting a tattoo. I had a scammer that was convinced that I would pay him money. He was so convinced that he got a tattoo in order to join my fake business.
"
That is actually kinda fucked up.
me
"Great question. We pretend to be a gullible victim. The more time that a scammer spends with a fake victim, the less time he can invest in a real one. We create a throwaway email account and use it to talk to scammers. We try to get their bank account information. It always belongs to a mule, someone who is being scammed into helping launder money for the scammer. So we contact the bank and try to convince the mule that they are being used to commit a crime."
Yeah I didn't mean to be rude to anyone but I would like people to stop sending me sexual questions that have no medical importance. I would answer questions about the dangers of pregnancy for someone with my illness and things of that nature but sending me graphic messages makes me really uncomfortable. Not just as a disabled person but as a person person.
"I honestly was waiting for this question. The first couple of weeks, I met him almost daily and at some point he even remembered my name. 
In person he seems a lot more relaxed and doesn't stotter unlike in the interviews. 
Hes also less of an expert in everything than I first thought, before meeting him. This doesn't mean, that I don't respect him, which I do, but the time with him has taught me, that he is not the superhuman I first thought. He is just like us, but with more commitment to fullfill his plans.
I now see him more as a Steve Jobs of engineering, who doesn't tell you how to walk, but in which way to go."
I've got a Monday that I'll trade you for a Friday. 
Would you rather fight 100 chickens? or a 100 ft chicken?
Leeroy Jenkins is his characters name. The guy is Ben Schulz.
"I am a 32 year old woman who has never dated. I am stuck in the middle of knowing that I am pretty freaking cool, and feeling totally unworthy of actual, genuine affection of a man. What advice do you have for me? "
"Thanks for the AMA! In a recent Doctor Who Magazine, Steven Moffat said that ""Oxygen"" was your backup monster idea because you couldn't get your main idea to work. Firstly, it's cool that even your backup ideas are brilliant, and secondly, what was your main idea, and do you think we'll ever get to see it on screen?"
"I'd like to share a phone call from one of my favorite baiters. 

https://youtu.be/uuolnPFoJOw

This is Mr. Pricky. He is one of the best scambaiters."
Having been married before Tinder was a thing and now being single in the Tinder world is crazy.  To be honest the biggest thing I feel is that first impression is more critical now.  People aren't going to 'waste' their time getting to know you better if it isn't there right away. Everyone believes that the perfect match is going to be the next swipe and they are going to fall in love on first sight. 
"I'm an adult, and the time varies. Some times I find more fake sites to kill than I have time for. Baiting only takes a few minutes a day. Site killing can take much more."
"Hi! Ehlers-Danlos is a disease (there are more than a dozen types; I'm the rare defect that has a cross between the Hypermobility and Vascular types) and it primarily affects collagen, thus presenting in almost every way possible in a human body since humans are made up of it.

People think it's only frequent joint pain and dislocations - and I have those daily. But it takes a toll on what may seem really random, but isn't.

For example the intestines are made of collagen, and I suffer from GI problems that range from intestinal failure/motility issues/stomach cramping to chronic constipation and a severe gluten allergy. One of my other defects happens to be an igA deficiency (immunoglobulin A) which is autoimmune and makes me unable to eat gluten, get frequent infections, etc. I'm not Celiac. The foods I can't eat are not only gluten based.

For me, at this point, I'm debilitated and can't work due to all the complications of this illness - it relapses and remits spontaneously with no real warning or cause and I'd drive a boss crazy with how often I'd have to call out sick. Which sucks because I was just about to finish school as a Nurse.

Other things it affects due to collagen are the heart valves (I have mitral valve prolapse and slightly enlarged aorta) and any organ can prolapse which I'm currently dealing with, it's painful and terrifying that my organs can have nearly fallen out of my body and doctors just do the 'shrug' emoji at me.

Thank you for your question!!"
You mentioned the kids are from her previous marriage. How did that marriage finish? Was it also related to her cheating?
"My deepest condolences. 

It seems that you need a lawyer. You have the upper hand. Prepare yourself so she can't rob you blind in a divorce. 

See if you can arrange to leave the children as safe as possible. Since they are not blood and if you're not close to them, you are not responsible for them, their mother is. 

Safeguard your property and finances through the lawyer. Divorce is terrible, the emotional drain is not something to wish unto others. Worse so is to go through it and be faced with financial insecurity. 

Don't be greedy, don't be spiteful. But you must leave her, she clearly does not have your best interests at heart. "
"You don't need a VPN to bait. Major email services like gmail strip your IP address from the header. If you contact a scammer with a gmail account he would only get an address in California, googles home, not yours.

Coz he don't needa go the same route that I went. 
You're super lame and nobody gives a shit about your stories. What's it feel like to be such a loser? 
I'm so damn sorry.  But the guys above me... yeah.
Were you close enough to smell his musk?
"I would say it has. By the time I was fifteen I was already an agnostic, however it had more to do with not believing what I was being told. I think I truly realized how cruel fanatics could be when I began The Joy House. They were not only highly abusive in concerns to verbal abuse, but they were manipulative. They tried to brainwash me into believing I was possessed by a demon. They tried to manipulate me into believing Obama was the anti-Christ. They used conversion therapy. They used religion to justify terrible punishments. They informed me that only God could heal my medical issues as justification for ignoring them. They informed me that unless I became a Christian they would keep me there until I was 18. There was so much hate. "
"I count your episodes among my favourites of Capaldi's tenure. What was it like writing one of the Doctor's trademark epic speeches?! 

*You are monsters. That is the role you seem determined to play, so it seems that I must play MINE. The man that stops the monsters.*"
"That's pretty creepy, dude. The least you could do is request a photo and send it along with a dick pic."
"Nothing ever causes cheating except someone choosing to cheat. There are always other options. A decent person would have broken up with you first.

And while fuck that guy for participating, he's not worth anything to you. Leave him be and let him deal with a cheater now. He'll get screwed over too as his punishment in the future."
best advice you'll get from this thread dude. cut your losses and move the fuck on. no girl is worth staying with who cheats on you. 
"Sweet damage control.

""You got me, haha, oh wait I was just *trolling* all along xd"""
"It has caused real problems in my current relationship. I think I might be in love for the first time, and it is absolutely terrifying. "
lol wrong sub
"GHSV2 female here, thank you for doing this!! "
"I take medication every day to suppress it, so I haven't had one since the initial one twelve years ago. 
"
"I was pretty close, but I couldn't smell his musk :( 

probably because he showers regularly"
"Wow! That was really sweet advice!

You may be a normal dude from Michigan, but you are pretty freaking cool to give that answer, even if it's off the shelf."
How can you be sure you're not a patient there and you're not imagining all of this happening right now?
How old are you and how much of your time does this take up? 
"I was home schooled until the eighth grade. I appreciate how hard my parents worked to provide me with an education, but I personally wouldn't recommend it for two simple reasons.

First, it can rob a child of precious early experience socializing with other children during some very formative years. Of course there are other places a child can socialize, but for me personally, I had quite a bit of catching up to do once I got into public school.

Second, being homeschooled means that all your subjects are likely taught by one (maybe two) individuals. Even with good curriculum, I don't know that one person can be qualified to provide good instruction in such varied subjects as the sciences, mathematics, English, history, et cetera. That's a lot to ask of one person who may or may not have teaching experience or credentials. You are also less likely to have your beliefs challenged at home than you are in a more pluralistic environment such as public (or even private) school.

It goes without saying that my experience is not representative of everybody's; these are just my two reasons based on my upbringing. I certainly didn't have a bad experience, but I would not home school my children."
"What's going through my mind is: ""Fuck this guy, I'm gonna kill him.""
Also: What did I do? How did I fail? What could I have done to make her happier?

I think it's been going on for quite some time, maybe a month or more? She's been distant..."
"Alas, I only have one upvote.  I don't suppose you can tell us about the tattoo?"
How do I get the Ice Key in Banjo Kazooie?
"So what if it's irrelevant to ops problem. You do realize this is r/AMA, right? "
I pretended to accept their beliefs. They called me one of their biggest success stories until I put a stop to it at 21 when they tried to post my college graduation picture.
Thanks for ruining a great video for me.  It's as though you told me Santa Claus was fake.
I feel like that would just result in it getting distressed and calling in 100 other 100 ft chickens
Your proudest moment in baiting?
I take a pill every morning and forget about it. I haven't had an outbreak since my initial one. The only time it crosses my mind is when I'm dating someone new and need to tell them. 
"Should we expect to find you and Chris Chibnall at the same time next year, chilling out?"
"That's probably the strangest question I've ever been asked in my life... I've looked the mirror and questioned a lot of things but I've never considered how lucky I am to have transgender people pee wherever they want to. 

I've unfortunately never reached out to the transgender community in Nigeria. "
"I've never had what I would consider a bad reaction. In the few cases where a guy hasn't wanted to move forward with things, they were still very compassionate about it and clearly didn't want to hurt my feelings. Almost every time I have told someone, they have asked many questions which makes me feel better that I'm helping to educate people. "
the questions I want answered most are the ones you aren't answering :(
Flatline: What was the discussion between you and Peter when writing/performing the hand-escaping-the-train scene? (That's a classic - both visually marvellous and LMAO hilarious) Was the A113 reference intentional? (Pixar nerd by here) And how many takes did Peter do for his victory dance?
Asking the real shit
You are not alone. Many places like this have been shut down over the last 20 years. Keep fighting the good fight and fuck those places straight to hell! 
Hey it's me. I'm in trouble. Am in the Philippines right now for a family emergency. I lost my wallet and need $2 grand sent to me by Western Union Money Order. HELP?
Has this hurt your view on religion in general?
"Oh yes, that's a regular occurrence. Not even an act of physical violence. For me a simple threat is enough to walk out and lock the door behind me. Call the cavalry and get the straps/needles going.

Edit: Actually, even the vibe I get from someone, that some shit is about to happen, is enough. My gut has not been wrong too often in 12 years.

The best thing is hard to say. The staff I work with are gold. They're the best, a bunch of troopers who keep their sense of humour and support each other like none I've ever seen before. 

I work in acute psych, so to see someone recover from a mental health issue and go out to live life again as it it should be lived, that makes the thing worth doing. I am genuinely grateful when that happens, for whatever reason. Whether it's conversations I've had, or the meds they take, or the alignment of the moon, I don't care. I just like to see people leave me better than they came to me. 

Unfortunately it seems very infrequent that I see that. Chronic care is challenging, because they're ill, and will be. Substance induced psychosis is (one of) my personal peeves. All this crap about marijuana being the greatest thing since sliced bread. Take a look at it from my side, you wouldn't be so sold on the idea."
why after 8 years are you still in fast food and not in restaurant/bar? 
It was downright disgusting asking me what I look like down there and other less clinical requests. I'm actually asexual and I don't have a problem admitting that but regardless of my sexual preference it's rude to message someone things of that nature. I reported the users.
"Then you know what you have to do. 

Wait. That sounds way sinister. I mean you need to end this relationship and find happiness elsewhere. "
What advice would you give to someone who dreams of writing a Doctor Who episode one day? Asking for a friend...
"I am very shy. With all those dates I am becoming less shy.
One of my dates thinks I have Aspergers. I also have a very conservative family. Maybe that's why I started dating so late. I live in a small city and I didn't had my drivers license till last year, so I couldn't go out very much."
