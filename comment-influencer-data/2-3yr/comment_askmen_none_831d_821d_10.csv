"My advice is to trim and not shave. Just get everything short enough that it lays down and looks like a nice lawn rather than an unkempt jungle. I do the bush, balls, and taint like this approx once every 2 weeks. 

If you shave, you're going to have to do it every couple days because your balls and shit are going to turn into a spiky mace swinging around impaling your dick and legs and taint and woman. No one wants that. 

Just keep it trimmed. Trust me."

"Hers...I don't know, for whatever reason I like staying at other people's houses and looking at all their stuff.  It's kind of like a sleepover because, you know, I'm totally 10-years-old.
"
"Either you trust her or you do not.  If you trusted her, would you be here asking us?


In your shoes I'd straight-up tell her it is absolutely not an issue if you did since we were on a break, and I can understand why you might have done it and that's fine, but if you lie about it to me after today we have a serious problem.  If I said that to a person I trusted, I would take their answer to that as fact."

but the amount of not continuing the conversation. 

 In a lot of ways, I'm understanding of having the one to be to start texts/moves/etc, but at least when I do, at least try something to add to the conversation to add substance in the discussion so it can not die.

Had a buddy who did this same thing.  At the time it aggravated me but after it all I realized he just really liked me and wanted to be like me. He thinks you're the coolest guy. 
I mean I'm not wrong I guess?
"I've seen girls asking why a guy they turned down (whether for a date, for sex, or for something else) stopped trying.  What the hell did you expect?

From what I've managed to parse, the idea is that it's basically token resistance, and he's supposed to buck up, push a little harder (whether that day, or some undefined period of time), and prove how much he wants her by keeping at it or some crap like that.  In actuality, it's a rejection, and most guys aren't going to keep trying after being told no.  It also takes other forms, like what basically amounts to ""I told my guy we were going too fast and I wanted to take things slow, now he's taking things slow and I don't know what to do.""

To make this even worse, the ""no, but keep trying"" is exactly the same no as the ""no, stop trying.""  Realistically, the answer to the issue is that someone who's this bad at basic communication isn't mature enough to date in the first place, so I guess it kind of works itself out."
"You ask her politely, yet firmly to leave. "
"Oh my goodness so many things. 

-Wow that ass is so nice.

-Why isn't the guy slapping it???

-Seriously, he's gonna keep his hands behind his head while she rides him like a maniac?

-Of course I'd get like 10 texts in a row right now. (Puts phone on silent)

-Wow this chick can ride.

-Maybe I should get on Tinder after this. 

-Seriously he hasn't touched her ass once. How am I supposed to pretend that's me?

-Okay don't randomly think of a friend or relative. Fuck.

-How the fuck did he win the election though? We're just going to do this shit for four years?

-I should save the link to this video in a notepad so I don't have to search for it next time.

"My dog destroyed a pair of shoes she left at mine, so I threw them away. I get a call...

"It is becoming more formal and distant, we don't hate each other and I'll always love and appreciate him for what he has done for me, but we are very different people. I've never been one to confide in him, and he was never overly warm or the type to sit down and have a long bonding session. "
"I've seen it as a cry for help. One girl in particular used me as a side dude. She said she broke up with him and they weren't together. I checked social media to verify but her relationship status was private and he didn't have social media. 

For a couple we hung out and she paraded me around to her friends and family. She took me to a concert she knew he'd be at. Randomly she pulls me into her and starts making out with me. 

A couple days later she disappears out of my life. Doesn't return calls or texts and I had no idea what was going on. Then, bam. Top of my newsfeed they're together in a picture on her Facebook. 

I asked her friend what the hell happened. Apparently they were ""on a break"" because he stopped giving her attention. She used me to make him jealous and made out with me in front of him. It worked and they got back together. Married in fact. "

"Just being kind and understanding in everyday boring conversations. Listening is key, and being attentive even if she's just going on about something you're not necessarily interested in. She most likely gives you that courtesy for your interests so it means a lot to reciprocate. 

Another small one is just doing your half of the housework. Lots of blogs and articles talk about how even if the husband is the sole worker and the wife stays home with kids or whatever, there's still a lot you can do to make her life easier. Sure, you worked a full week and want to come home and relax, but her home is her office; if she's keeping up with kids and doing cooking/cleaning during the day, she deserves to relax afterwards also. It's a compromise and it's easy to feel selfishly judgmental of the other person. 

Another easy one (for me) is to just remind her why you're married with smiles, cute comments on how she looks, just randomly looking at her and saying I love you while smiling is a great gesture. Kissing her randomly while you're cooking or cleaning or just watching a tv show. Small acts of affection for your partner are simpler and worth more than buying expensive gifts or flowers all the time. 

Also, buy her some flowers once in awhile. Not for holidays though. Pick a random Thursday and grab a spring or summer bouquet on your way home from work. If she asks why just tell her you were thinking about her and got them. "
"When I don't like them anymore. When I feel the friendship is only one sided. When hanging out with these people feels more like an obligation. When I feel remaining friends makes me ""sick"" and unhappy."
"I had a really embarrassing unrequited crush on a workmate, I'm talking longwinded letters confessing my love type shit,  that ended predictably badly. 

I sat down and thought,  'why do I keep doing this with women?' And decided I didn't want to do that anymore. 

I eventually realised it was the result of a combination of attitudes/behaviours on my part:

I was insecure about approaching women,  so I tended to fixate on one particular girl at a time, usually the girl I spent the most time with who was nicest to me, as 'the one'

I wouldn't make any kind of outright come on to this girl, because that was too risky,  instead I would try to slow burn it and impress her as 'a friend' while the obsession grew.

The disproportionate amount of praise, attention, and possibly gifts I would shower on this girl would only make me more obsessed with her, in an emotional version of the sunk cost fallacy. (The sunk cost fallacy for anyone unfamiliar is what makes gamblers stay at a table even though they've already lost thousands - the fact that they've spent thousands just makes it even harder to walk away without something to show for their effort).

I wanted a relationship primarily to 'fix' me, and was attracted to women I perceived I could try to 'save' in turn too.

I was insecure around sex, and felt sexually undesirable,  which meant that I attempted to overcompensate with a quasi-romantic approach to love. Where my kind of sexless, love from afar was 'real love'. (this is a common trope in fiction,  where the protagonist is a hapless doofy guy, awkward around sex who nonetheless has a heart of gold)

Also as consequence I viewed sex as bad and thus men who were comfortable in approaching women were douchebags and women who responded positively to them were betraying themselves (me, they were betraying me) "
"Sorry laughed at the pic.  But honestly, I use no-guard and cut around my shaft, ball area and lower an area,(below the belt).  I don't cut the thigh area, I just leave it.  In your case if it is as hairy as the pic states, you might want to pass over it with the trimmers.

I have found actually shaving hurts and it is more prone to ingrown hairs and bumpy redness.  Too each their own on shaving though.  no-guard is close enough.  "
This is clever and doable.
Trying to drop hints and make the guy guess instead of just saying what she wants.

"""Whoever cares less, holds all the power"" It's bullshit that it's mostly true. "
"It's her testing the waters. She wants to feel safe so instead of going out with someone who she hasn't before, she is bringing a friend. Once she feels safe around you, her friend won't be there. The friend is also the gate keeper, but if you're friends and not known for being a douche or have any social stigmas, you should be fine. Just have fun, and don't try to make it just about you and the girl you're interested in, be a gentleman and you'll go far kid. Also be sure to say you had fun and we should do more things together, her reaction to that should be a good gauge on how the night went. Good luck!

"My place. My pantry is better stocked, and my kitchen-ware is better and more abundant. Unless she's a professional chef, I'm absolutely certain of this.

So, if I'm feeding this woman (and I am), then my place is the place. Plus, it's clean, I know where everything is, and I have no roommates. "

"I cannot discount what you say- you're coming at it from a legitimate point of view.

However, I would argue that there is a stark difference between there being a distinct lack of chemistry between two people (which seems to be what you describe) and having one participant viewing dating as an audition process from which she (""she"" in this scenario, anyway) is entirely disengaged.

Dating a person and finding them kind of boring is not exactly what I'm describing. "

"I grew up in the suburbs and moved into the inner city, so I had to teach myself a bit. Here's what I've come up with:

* In general, try to get a sense of what the area you're in is like. Know it by reputation if you can, but also look for signs. Old or damaged cars, bars over windows, property in disrepair, litter or broken glass on the ground, lack of window air conditioners (especially on the ground level) are all signs of a bad area.
* When you're in an unfamiliar place, stick to main roads, and populated and well-lit areas.
* Keep your wallet, phone, and other valuables hidden and secure. Try not to flash any cash.
* In cities, people will try to trick you into giving them money by giving you a sob story. These people are scammers.
* Pay attention to your surroundings. When you're in a bad area, take your headphones off, don't look at your phone, look around and occasionally behind you."

"I have a friend who lost his virginity to his wife at 26. Another friend of mine is 29 and a virgin.

The first guy was super outgoing and social but always had a weight problem. So he was typecast as the ""happy go lucky big guy friend"" and was always surrounded by super hot girls that just saw him as a buddy. He was always cool about it but you could tell that it murdered his self esteem.

The other guy is really good looking but can't approach a girl if his life depends on it. I actually tried twice to get him laid with friends of my friends who flat out offered to bang him but he just kept dodging their advances. The rest of my friends just kind of assume that he's either gay or has a huge issue with girls and sex and won't help him anymore.

Also, I think some people just see the opposite sex as some impossible puzzle. That's a recurring theme I see in questions from men and women on this sub and it kind of baffles me."

"As a woman, I personally find the opposite to be true. I feel a lot better going to someone else's house if it's like the first couple of dates. I like the idea of being able to leave whenever I want, no complications. I get a little anxious with men at my place. I want to be able to cleanly remove myself out of a situation instead of having to remove a situation out of my house. Even though I've never had any problems whether at their place or mine I much prefer theirs. But if we're a thing and we're really dating, I prefer mine. That's just because I'm lazy though. "

I'd ask a question, and I'd get a genuine answer. However she wouldn't ask me anything. So I'd just go with another question. We basically talked about her unless I had some way to talk about whatever she had done. But she never asked anything about me. Just no way to move the conversation forward. Kinda sucked to be honest haha"

"fuck man i cant breathe. lol your diagram. if youre hairy dont clean shave unless a girl requests it. I use the minimum guard on my trimmer in that triangle area over my johnson, then clean up that mess with the same guard behind it. Never do anything beyond a few inches behind your balls tho, or youll end up learning the terrors of recovering from ass shaving. Most important is just very carefully cleaning up the shaft. I'd do this with a razor if i had a girlfriend and she requested it, but i just use the short guard all around the shaft. "

"If the guy really did bang her, he probably wouldnt be out trying to sell his story. I dont know a single person who has ever done this that actually ever fucked the girl.

Still, I'm not a fan of taking people back after breaks. What this tells me is she thought the grass was greener and when she walked and found out it's brown she came back to you by default. This makes me wonder if at some other point down the road she will also try and find greener pasture."
"Can I make an argument though? Honestly if a girl can't keep me entertained, that's not a good sign. If I get bored maybe we're not really not connecting. I think that's fair to say. "
"I feel like you're vastly overestimating how important women are in our lives.

"Most dating mistakes fall into one of two categories.

Entitlement and desperation.

The entitled girl believes that the guy should do all the work.  And I'm not just talking about paying for the dates.  I'm taking about carrying the conversation, ignoring her apparent disinterest to demonstrate that he's interested, making over-the-top, rom-com-worthy gestures, and conducting an inquisition that would make the Spanish drool just to find out enough about her to maybe like her.

The desperate girl believes that they should do all the work.  They fall in love to save the guy the trouble of having to woo her, do over-the-top, rom-com-worthy gestures that make most guys flee screaming into the night, and generally strike an unhealthy balance of clinginess and pushing the relationship forward instead of letting it grow at its own pace.

Obviously, those are the extremes, and there are sins in the middle too, but the best advice I've ever heard still rings true: be interesting and be interested.  You don't have to obsess over every little detail of your dates' life, but if you don't ask follow up questions, you're going to seem checked out.  Likewise if you give monosyllabic answers to everything your asked, you're going to seem checked out.

Ask questions, even if they seem stupid.  Tell stories, even if they seem stupid.  And don't take yourself too seriously.  If you're shy, be shy.  Make a joke about how shy you are.  If your brash, be brash.  Make a joke about how brash you are.

Dating is just the first step in a relationship.  Don't expect *every* date to lead somewhere.  The reason you go on dates is to screen candidates for that.  But do expect *any* date to lead somewhere.  Keep an open mind.  You never know who will surprise you."
My girlfriend would be really upset if I didn't take the money.
"Acting like we're way farther along in a relationship than it seems would be reasonable. Like in the first couple dates talking about how she *knows* her dad is gonna like me, can't wait til he meets me. Or how she should warn me now that Valentine's Day is a really big day for her, when we're on our first date and it's April. 

Or, you know, saying she's in love on our third date. "

"A year ago I was 282 lbs. I went on a very big trip with my friends and it was one of the most memorable times in my life. I had so much fun and we took so many beautiful pictures. When we got back home from our trip I got the photos developed and realized just how obese I was. The best time in my life, the biggest smile I have ever had is on a body that I was disgusted by. I started eating healthier and I began working out as much as i could. Eventually I got a gym membership at a place that is open 24/7 and it made a huge difference. I am now down to 236 lbs and I am in a much happier place. I'm still not completely happy with my body. I have a larger belly than I would like and my chest could use some improvement, but I feel much better."

I finally called him, and told him that he doesn't get to call me son, only one man can do that and it damn sure isn't him. Also told him that if I had to make a road trip to his house to get him to stop harassing mom, I had no problem driving across Texas. Haven't heard a peep from him since

My step dad-fucking great. He's the one I immediately think of when I think 'dad'. We talk regularly (on the phone since I live about 100 miles away), we see each other when I visit his town or he visits mine. He's getting older (currently 70), but he still gets around just fine. Had to convince him to stop riding horses at the ranch, almost got his foot caught in the stirrup last month. Anyways, our relationship is awesome, and if my wife's child is a buy, we're going to name it after dad "
"I think that's only true if the person who's actually showing interest cares enough.

I watched the breakup with my clients 2 days before my gf of 3 years broke up with me. As I was watching the movie I saw all the signs of what was to come. The problems were a mirror image of our relationship. It was fucking surreal. 
Quiet you fool!
"Sorry to hear for your loss. The only advice is to take all the time you need to grieve. You might start feeling better in a few weeks, or it could take years. It's hard to deal with the reality that your best friend is no longer here with you.

Keep doing what you are doing - hanging out with close friends, stay busy, and take some time to cry, scream, yell, and laugh. I'm sure you have many good memories (and maybe even some sad times), you'll always have those. Cherish them.

Just remember to enjoy your life. If you think about it, your best friend would want you be happy and to always carry a part of them wherever you go."

"Agreed, in my experience, women don't care about hair if it looks neat. Going full blown bald is a monster in and of itself, especially if you're Chewbacca as the figure suggests. It's totally not worth the uncomfortableness and upkeep. Just keep it 'kempt' and you'll be fine. "

OP if this ever happens to you again you should know that you didn't deserve the way she treated you. And you should also know that a woman who freaks out, runs away, expects you to chase her, and accuses you of being gay just because you had some performance anxiety is, to be frank, a massive cunt. Don't waste your time. "

I enjoy varying sex acts as much as the next guy, but I'm not a sex addict, those things are nice but they aren't *so* special I can't live without them.

"I am not poly, but I have a ton of exposure to the poly community through being active in the BDSM community (a lot of BDSM people are poly). I'll give what perspective I can.

Polyamory is not about abdicating responsibility. In fact, being successful in polyamory requires more responsibility, not less. It means navigating having loving, caring relationships in multiple configurations, managing the sheer logistics of it all, taking great care to try to accommodate everyone's feelings and needs, etc. It requires managing the inevitable jealousy in a mature fashion. It means having a huge focus on good communication. 

If he just wants to bang other chicks, then what he is looking for is multiple fuckbuddies. He needs to avoid exclusive commitments and to be honest with the chicks he's banging about what he's doing. Some will be fine with that and others might not, but if he thinks that being poly means he can just stick his dick wherever then he's in for a rude awakening."

"I cut my entire family out of my life. Most of it came down to the fact that I outgrew my family and I decided to look at them as people instead of blood. Everyone in my family are heavy drug users. My mother cross the moral line by holding back information and finding ways to use it to make me do certain things. For example, my mother only told me about my infant cousins death when I told her I wouldn't be able to make it home for Christmas. My cousin had died weeks ago, but kept the information from me until it helped her. My father is a drunk who like to abuse the people around him. All of the people I cut out of my life, I did because they only used me to make their lives better and cared very little (if at all) about my happiness."

"You're being absolutely reasonable, and I commend you for doing so. There's a reason STD rates have skyrocketed in recent years, and the refusal to take accountability for one's sexual health is why. Any time STD testing threads come up there I'm astounded at how many people never have, or rarely have them.

I'm a woman, but if I suggested mutual STD testing and the guy got angry then I'd probably cut and run. It doesn't necessarily mean this person is trying to hide an STD from you, but it means her attitudes towards sexual health are pretty backwards and her logic isn't all there. Those two issues should be seriously considered as deal breakers. "

About two weeks later she texted me asking why I disappeared even though she didn't even respond to the last text I had sent her.

That's funny. A love confession out of nowhere gets you branded as creepy in the US (usually).
"It's more common than, I think, most people are aware. Despite how often it might get mentioned in the internet, it's not something that is discussed much in real life. My friends talk about sex, and I just kind of bow out of the conversation - I have nothinh to contribute and no one wants to hear it. And if you bring it up it sounds like you're complaining and you come off as ""hurr durr desparate virgin"".

The internet avoids that stigma under the pretext of anonymity, so it's easier to discuss it.

I have a few friends, men and women, who didn't lose theirs until their mid-20s despite being otherwise normal, social, active people, and most people they know didn't know."
Dating someone simply to have the status/benefits that come with a relationship.
"This whole thing sounds like too much trouble, to be honest. I would probably bail if it were happening to me.

Look, set aside the ""did she hook up with someone while we were on a break"" thing (spoiler alert: I would be surprised if she didn't). Think about the fact that she bailed in the first place because she wasn't happy and didn't know what she wanted. This is very clear communication on her part.

It was only after a month that she came back. Ready to settle for you. I don't know about you, but I want to be with someone who is sure, pulling in the same direction and for whom I am the first choice. ""But I love her"", ultimately, if not a good answer for why to stay in a relationship. Love is not some finite thing that you can only have with one person on the whole planet. Spend your energy on someone who wants the same things you do.

Falling in love has made her the most beautiful person in the world to me. "
"I cannot believe I never looked up how the whole love protocol in Japan looks; I looked up like every country ever out of curiosity but surely a nation as bizarre as Japan deserves inspection; so this is what I found:

- In Japan relationships are started with a love confession (kohuhaku) apparently. One person confesses love to the other and if the other responds in kinds, congratulations, you are now a monogamous exclusive couple until one de-loves. 
- This process is fairly gender neutral for all the gender roles Japan is so fond of; it is very common for women to love-confess to men
- These love confessions are apparently often like out-of-nowhere as apparently it is improper to be flirty or hinty or whatever before it. You're not supposed to show any signs and just jump into the blind and hope the other has been hiding feelings too.
- Japanese people when they go out tend to go out to a cheap ass place and it's more about the contact than the food; everyone pays their own share.
- no physical intimacy apparently occurs before the love confession
- Japanese people apparently know each other as friends typically before the love-confession as part of a larger friend-group

Anyway; this is what the internet tells me; it's all quite interseting. Specially the ""love confession"" stuff keeps returning everywhere on like 8 independent sources I found all calling it kohuhaku; I guess that's a big thing.

In any case, despite a lot of these websites comparing it to ""the west"" (clearly they mean ""the US"") it is not at all so dissimilar from what happens here in Europe except for the whole ""no flirting before the love confession"" thing. Love-confessions here also seem to mark the implied start of monogamy but you're free to have sex and flirt before it."

"Where i work, we deal with aggravated members of the public quite often. It is an office with 18 women and 4 men. Staff have been assaulted in the pass and people kick off regularly. We have no security whatsoever. What we have is an alarm system that causes an alarm to go off upstairs when someone downstairs in reception feels threatened or is in danger.

When the alarm goes off, it is expected for us 4 men to run as quickly as we can down stairs to confront whatever is in front of us and deal with it. That could be someone shouting, someone with a knife or someone who just accidentallypressed their alarm. The point being we don't know what will happen. We are expected to possibly run to confront an armed and aggravated member of the public simply because we are men. We are just council workers. Im lucky because i served in the Army so know how to look after myself but the other guys havnt. They havnt been trained in physical intervention or conflict reaolution or anytjing like that.

"Why'd you delete the last thread? Anyways..

When I was younger, I applied for a job as a swimming instructor. I was told 'We dont hire new instructors straight out, everyone has to be a deck attendant first.' I thought that made sense. The role as a deck attended was to watch and instruct swimmers from the deck while the instructor took them for one on one time throughout the lesson.

Of course, they meant to tell me 'We don't hire *male* instructors' because in the three years I was there they hired several new female instructors.

Maybe show him some specific incidents, like in the news or the police dailies or something. Explain to him very carefully how to be safe and WHY he needs to do/not do certain things. If he hangs out in a place with lots of homeless people long enough, like public transportation, he will probably see someone get stabbed eventually. 

In my experience you can't fix stupid. You can try to educate, but they usually insist on learning the hard way. 

Usually people from rural areas have more sense than that, at least in the US. Mostly because out there the predators don't have to worry about police. "

"1) don't go to your/her place. It's real sketchy

2) don't have plans for conversation topics. Let conversation flow naturally; you pulling out cue cards is a bad idea. 

3) Initiate simple/non-sexual physical contact early on. Shake her hand when you greet her if you don't think a hug is appropriate. Disregard this if you're European. 

4) If she speaks to you first, do NOT backhand her across the face and say, ""You speak when spoken to, woman""


5) Wear appropriate clothes; ie a lobster costume. Make multiple references to slathering her in butter

"Those guys usually got lucky fairly early, which gave them the confidence to continue being successful later on.

Unlike what some people tell you, confidence doesn't all come from within. If life beats you down again and again, you're not gonna magically ""become confident"" or any of that bullcrap. You just get lucky once, and then it becomes a vicious cycle of success."
I just cannot grasp why or how is 'work wife / mom' a thing.

It'a good. I was very blessed to be born into a family who wanted to have a kid and care about me.
"Should a woman be able to breastfeed without being shamed 'n shit? Obviously, You'd gotta have to be a retard to disagree. 

Women should realize and keep in mind that we'll look at their tits if they have them out. So if they decide to do it, don't be pissy that I look at your tits, because tits are cool yo. 

Other than that, I don't give a shit. "
"&gt;Stay out of any office drama/gossip

This is crucial. You'll usually find someone who wants to talk trash about one of the office members in the first week, wanting you to join in. A lot of people fall for this trap as they'll be trying to ingratiate themselves and make a new friend. Big mistake!

"Kicked my ass off the couch after a lay off and told me she wasn't  gonna ""date a fucking bum, so stop being a fucking bum."" At first I was mad but then I realized she was right. I was staying up till 5-6am and not getting up till 3pm. Then just smoking and playing video games all day. She's now my wife and still a big motivator in my life. "
"This isn't entirely related but you reminded me that a few days ago I overheard a woman tell a guy, *""Nigga if yo credit score ain't above 600 get away from me like right now.""* I laughed and then thought it sounded kind of reasonable. I mean 600..... yeah that's fair. I hope the rest of their date was pleasant and their financial discussion was robust.  "
"A lot of people are going to tell you she was cheating on you, and while I don't like to jump to conclusions I will say this. If your girl gets with another dude within a week of leaving you, that's probably the reason she left. Even if she wasn't cheating on you, she was definitely already thinking about the other guy. "

"I volunteer with an international peace education charity, so generally once a year I'll take four 11 or four 15 year olds to one of the camps, generally overseas.  
Almost every time I go through an airport with the kids, at least 1 person out of the check in attendant, security, or border control will demand documentation proving I'm meant to have these kids. Sometimes the fact that we're all wearing matching shirts and jumpers with the organisation's logo clearly printed on it is enough, but usually not.  
Obviously, I'm happy to comply and make sure I have quick access to all the relevant forms naming me as a temporary guardian etc, but one year during training I mentioned how much of a hassle it is, and found out that it's only the guys that have to deal with this. None of the female volunteers have even been questioned about travelling with the kids."

"We were 16 years old, she stepped out the door of the community centre into a group of the boys standing about smoking in a circle.  She was very pretty, we all knew her, so one of the guys pulled her into the circle, and we started pushing her guy to guy to guy (we were 16, remember), when she got to me, she threw her arms around my neck, and wouldn't let go.

That is what I call a hint.  :)

"Well, reading the book description/featured review on Amazon makes it sound like a pretty good book about adjusting expectations to the real world.

&gt; Gottlieb, 37, made the decision to become a single parent after years of searching for Mr. Right. Four years later, when she still hadn’t found him, she decided to take a good look at her dating habits—and the dating habits of women around her—to see if the problem is not a dearth of good men but rather women’s expectations of them. Gottlieb finds that women want it all—and often aren’t willing to compromise on their list of traits their ideal mate must have. In their twenties, many women leave good relationships based on an elusive feeling that they could find something more with someone else, and they regret it down the road when their choices dwindle. It’s not that women aren’t willing to settle; it’s that many refuse to recognize that their vision of the perfect man doesn’t match reality. With the help of dating coach Evan Marc Katz, Gottlieb reconsidered her own standards in the hope of finding happiness. Gottlieb’s honest, astute analysis will resonate with many women and make them uneasy as they recognize themselves in her experiences and those of the women she interviews. Gottlieb makes a strong case in this groundbreaking work.

I haven't read the book, but if that description is accurate, it sounds like a book many people with unrealistic ideas about the perfect partner should read, and I wouldn't have a problem with someone I was married to owning it."

"Volunteer. Habitat for humanity, soup kitchen, senior center, art museum, church, political group, etc. Big gender skews at these things and easy opportunities to have conversations that lead into friendships.

It's not something a lot of guys like to do but you should think of it like this: if you're an average guy, you probably make around $20 an hour. If you volunteer 2 hours a week, that's like $40 of your time. You'd pay $40 a week to have some new friends and an easy, non-skeezy way to meet women, right? The chance is right here."
"I'll be blunt. There isn't any advice that is going to move you to enlightenment here. You're going to feel broken and lost and those times you feel good might make you feel bad as you may not feel you're allowed to experience happy for awhile. Your world is completely different now. Whatever it was, that's going to change and you'll have to figure out what that looks like. Create some routines and prepare to mindlessly drone through those routines. It sounds rough and robotic but having a routine will help you focus and avoid negative behaviors. It will keep you occupied. Something that's helped me is taking 15 to 20 minutes to be sad about it. Just have time set aside to let it overtake you. Cry. Laugh. Let it beat you to a pulp. At first it may seem futile bit as time goes on you'll have trouble filling 15 minutes with sad. And then you'll have trouble filling 10 minutes. It's a long process but slowly, the happy memories win out. You'll find yourself reflecting with a smirk and you'll get that hint of sad, but it won't always overwhelm.

You were best friends because you shared more happy than sad. This one big sad moment will not ruin the legacy he left for you. But that's in due time.

"You don't have anyone around to balance your mother's bs so you grow up thinking some things are normal, but they're actually not healthy behaviours. When she goes a bit irrational you just accept it because you don't know any better and there's no-one offering a different model.

You get strongly policed for showing any indication of aggression or anger. So instead of learning how to channel them healthily you learn to suppress your those emotions, along with the rest of them. You're kind of not really a person in a way, since you're only allowed to have certain emotions so you learn how to fake those. You can end up not feeling 'real' and not even realing it until much later in life.

You're not allowed to participate in anything that has any element of danger or risk so you don't really learn how to handle that. You just learn to avoid it. When you have to face it in the future it just makes you anxious and avoidant.

They don't like other people having too much influence over you so you can end up isolated from role models, older guys etc. If you show too much enthusiasm for some other leader or organisation or even an older friend then you'll often be subtly cut off from it. It means you have to figure out everything on your own because you don't have any mentors or role models. It can leave you lacking ambition, goals and general life direction as well as the basic skills and discipline to make those things happen. 

Without role models and mentorship guys just focus on what they are allowed to access. So mostly computer games or things like that. You end up not really knowing how to make friends with other guys or interact with all guy groups. They make you uncomfortable. You feel the banter and competetiveness is wrong and don't know how to handle it. You only form friendships with other similarly uncomfortable guys. Often the friendships are pretty shallow because you don't really know how to be good friends with a guy.

Mothers tend to communicate by expressing their feelings and indirectly stating what they want. It can be hard to understand because its emotional rather than rule based or logical so it changes all the time. What they want can be the opposite depending on how they are feeling. One day something being a mess is really bad. The next day its perfectly fine. Its random. So you end up learning to pay attention to her emotions and try and mind read that rather than her words. It fucks you up in a number of ways. You learn that the only thing you're supposed to do is make sure she's happy since nothing else really matters. You also learn to copy that as a communication style. To try and get what you want by being indirect and hinting at things and hoping people will read your mind. Basically how nice guys try to interact with people. That of course messes you up because everyone hates a Nice Guy^TM. And of course that creates terrible success with women when you get older.

It also teaches you to not have initiative. To be passive. Since you can't know what you're expected to do until you see what she is feeling its very difficult to be pro-active and take control of things. When the result of what you do is random it teaches you to avoid taking action since its just as likely to be wrong as right. You try and focus on not doing the right thing and really hope someone will make the right thing to do clear. You're always worried about doing the wrong thing. And you focus on other things you can control instead like a video game because at least there the rules are logical and consistent.

You learn to never ask for help. Every time you do so it gets kind of turned around. Its hard to describe, but there is this backwards and forwards thing that happens. If you ask for help with something that they don't know then its like you undermined their authority. To get it back they kind of pretend what you asked doesn't matter and wave you off with a bs meaningless non-answer. A bit like you're at fault for not knowing. If they do know the answer (or think they do) they won't tell you it. Instead they'll turn it into an opportunity to micromanage you with tiny instructions for every little step of the how to do the answer that just make you frustrated.

Those are a lot of disadvantages. I can't really think of any advantage other than being more comfortable around women, but that is a two edged sword since its more of a nice guy thing. I'd have to compare it to someone raised by a single father or two parents to really know what advantages I got out of it."

"I'm a girl I agree. Also, I've completely shaved... Down there. It feels amazing for about 8 hours then the itch. Oh the itch of growing hair. From there it gets sweatier than normal and I feel like I need to do a full sanitation every 6 hours. Then after a day or two the ingrown hairs happen and it looks like I contacted a disease. I'd this is what it's like for me I can't imagine the discomfort of regrowing all the hairy man parts, but and legs. "

All of my japanese friends (~18 yrs old) have been in at least one to two relationships, and I'm currently in a relationship. Seems like japanese people are especially reserved around new people or outsiders to their group and take time to warm up to them.  Especially japanese girls. They're like the polar opposite of western girls who are instant best friends literally minutes after they just meet. It could also being the culture that promotes obsession about whatever interests you, be it work, school, hobbies or whatever that end up leaving no time for anything else like a relationship.    "

"Obviously I don't know you, but it sounds like you're a ""good on paper but bad in person"" type.

30 first dates with no second dates is a lot when it's someone attractive (physically and in terms of having a life plan). That says you can definitely get your foot in the door, but you can't form a connection. You say you're good-looking and have a life carved out for yourself. Congrats, you check the boxes on paper.  That mostly just leaves your social skills and dating personality.

What do you have that's more substantial? Are you interesting to talk to and personable? Do you have hobbies or anything else adding richness to your life? If not, all those checked boxes sound...dull, 2D. If your dates can't connect to you as a person, there's no incentive to spend more time with you in any relationship capacity.

&gt; How do I keep them interested?

How do you showcase the parts of you that are interesting instead of just the checked boxes? How do you connect with people - shared passions or experiences? Are you eliminating interest by behaving in a pushy or otherwise undesirable way?

For example, I'm currently the only guy on a team with seven other women at work. They'll all do things together and not really invite me; nothing major but just grab coffee or lunch. As a result, they all have a much closer relationship with each other and I'm just kind of ""the random guy"" in the group. I've gotten comfortable with this, am able to get my work down super quick, and have taken to posting on Reddit and browsing the internet to kill time instead of engaging in the normal non-work conversations or activities but I definitely do feel excluded which gets pretty lonely and kind of sucks."

I'd add: depending on how they look. If they look pretty rough (potential junky, gang, etc type, they may not care or know that others in the area won't mess with them)

People from an area, especially more dangerous one, can spot an outsider. Maybe it's your dress, grooming, skin color, posture, or that they don't know you but know everyone else.

We humans prejudge others as a safety mechanism. Don't use prejudging to negatively discriminate but do use it to wisely discern."

"Majority of people in AskReddit and AskMen threads are all about how they hate nightclubs and rave parties, claims they can't listen to shit there etc. I know hundreds of people in my age range 21-27 who loves nightclubs and rather go to one than a bar. 

I spent 2 straight months partying in Chicago and every single time we went to a classic bar it sucked hell. Girls were kinda unapproachable since there's no dance floor and we eventually choose to stack up alcohol in our rooms and drink at our dorm lobby for sports events (after we couldn't get drunk when we went to a bar because it's fucking expensive at big games).

I have no idea how people say it's easier to get girls in bars than nightclubs, I brought girls to bars, I brought girls to nightclubs, I met them there and success rates are vastly different. The level of intimacy you get from touching bodies and dancing together will skip you a bunch of dates in less than minutes. So I don't get that disparity.

"I hung out in gang areas in highschool, and the walking confident or with purpose thing is really true, especially when alone or with a woman.  I always characterized the walk as a mix between tired, pissed off and in a hurry, and it never failed me with sane, but dangerous people.  It did fail with crazy and people specifically looking to fight with anyone because there isn't much you can do to avoid that type of conflict aside from not being around those people.  

It always amuses me when people say you'll be fine if you just mind your own business.  That's a good start, but looking weak can and will get you jumped whether or not you got nosy.  The two combined are a great way to stay safe though."

"-Reduced access to mental health care at my old college (much longer waiting period unless suicidal) (the women's center provided an alternate source of mental health care, even if your problem was in no way gender related)  
-The way I get treated around children  
-People assume that because I'm white and male I haven't been discriminated against on other bases. I have a minor congenital facial deformity. It's almost impossible to spot if you don't know what you're looking for now that I have facial hair, but as a child some kids were extremely cruel to me.  
-My car insurance rates  
-Strangers on the street at night acting like I'm a criminal of some kind.  
-I used to mentor the male half of a lego robotics after school program for elementary school kids. They shut down just the male half. Honestly they could have fired me and replaced me with a woman, I'm just mad that the kids didn't have the program any more. Sure half of them just wanted to dick around with legos, but some of them really got a lot out of it. I remember finally getting this one kid to understand gear ratios and as a result he won a drag race.  
-Very little money goes into prostate cancer and testicular cancer research.   
-I'm registered for the draft. They wouldn't take me under current service requirements, but I'm still not happy about it.   
-Teachers assuming I was just acting out when I couldn't read multiple lines of text due to a visual tracking issue  
-I routinely get excluded from social interactions between women in situations where it would be socially unacceptable or frowned upon were I not a man.  
-I don't know if it's technically discriminatory but dating is a nightmare for men.  I get that a lot of women feel less comfortable making the first move, but at least it's an option for them. A man who opts to sit back and wait is 99% of the time resigning himself to a life spent alone.

"When I first met my ex both I and another guy were into her and she had just gotten out of a multi-year relationship. When I made an advance she told me she wasn't over her ex and then ended up getting with the other guy, telling me after I found out she had a crush on him but didn't know how to tell me that so just told me she wasn't over her ex yet.

Fast forward a year and other guy has been out of the picture for 11 of those months and her and I are dating. When we talked about the summer before when she ended up with him she asked me why I didn't continue to pursue her after she said no the first time. I was just flabbergasted, I asked her if she was kidding and she just didn't get it. She told me she wasn't over her ex when I tried to initiate something which was a cover for her liking and going with another guy who was directly competing with me and loved to talk about how easy she was while I was in earshot and she wondered why I didn't continue to pursue her?! 

I just couldn't figure out her thought process, she told me I'm not into you like that in pretty much every way possible and then she's confused that I didn't continue to try to court her at the time? How is that a realistic expectation?! She's a fucking feminist too you think out of anyone she might be cognizant of what guys are being told about consent and have a little fucking self-awareness about it but that was just too much to ask."

Women are aliens /s"
"Most women I know want a dude that is taller than them, makes enough to support a family with combine salaries, won't embarrass them, can make them orgasm, generally slightly above average hygiene/fitness, it decently fun to be around, and doesn't have any major baggage (addiction, disability, massive debt, etc)

Sure they are standard, some of them not totally fair, but none of them are out of control. Most women don't expect an Adonis who makes six figures and is a professional comedian. They will settle for your dad jokes, bald head, and 4 miles a week running schedule.

Just my experience with dating. Maybe you all are from a city full of basic bitches. Who knows."
"&gt; out of their league

You're obviously not in that category. Delete facebook and hit the gym."
