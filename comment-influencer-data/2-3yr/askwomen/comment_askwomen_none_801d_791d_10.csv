"Not me, but my sister.

Pregnant with first (and only child) and goes into labour at or around the due date. No big deal.

She went into the hospital and was sent home because her contractions were too far apart and told to return when her contractions were once every x minutes. She remained calm for a number of hours before going back in still well before reaching the more frequent contractions as she felt something wasn't right and was a bit distraught about it. She's very quiet, gentle and sweet so she was not expressing her distress to others as well as we could pick up on it. 

The nurses again tried to send her away and she insisted something didn't feel right. The nurses weren't dismissive or rude, but they did push back a little and tell her child birth is stressful and she'll feel a lot of things she's never felt before that don't at all feel ""right"". Again she insisted she didn't want to go home and asked if they could just check anything at all for her.

They checked heart rates. Sure enough, every time she had a contraction her son's heart almost completely stopped. They performed an emergency cesarean and she was holding her son within half an hour of arriving back at the hospital. He was completely fine immediately after birth, but he may have died as her contractions increased if she had have waited."
"If they want to hiking and bring a pickaxe, I take that as a red flag."
"I'm a twin. Love it. Being her sister is truly the greatest pleasure of my life... anyway, we were gonna run some errands together no further than a mile from our apartment. As I reached for the door knob to leave, I suddenly had this overwhelming feeling my twin shouldn't come with me. It's strange because it wasn't like I was learning new information- it was like I was being reminded of the fact. Like when your being told 'you know so and so, she's friends with ...' and the lightbulb thought comes to mind ""oh ya ... I do.""

I turn back at her and tell her she's not coming with me. She responds with ""yeah, I know. Something's wrong"" (looking back, why didn't she ask me for an explanation as to 'why?').

Long story short, a lady ran a red light at a 4 lane intersection going 45, t-boning me across all 4 lanes into the light pole from the passenger side. 

My car was totaled- crushed so badly that my right shoulder was inches from the passenger window, my legs pinned under the steering wheel. If my twin would have came, she wouldn't be here. 

When I came to and was extracted from the car, the paramedics called my sister on speaker to tell her to meet us at the hospital. 

She left ten minutes prior to that phone call and had been walking towards my location. She said she didn't know where she was walking but knew she needed to be somewhere. In her words the ""feeling that i needed to be with you at that moment was so intense it's like I didn't have a choice. My body was doing it and I was along for the ride.""

Thank god she didn't come with me. "
"I'm a financially secure older woman who doesn't date for these reasons. At 58 with a good job and education, no debt and secure independent adult children I have no need to marry or confine myself to a steady/serious live in relationship. Men my age come with baggage, ex-wives, children and debt because if they had money they would be dating a hot 22 year old not someone their own age. Maybe I'm cynical but I'm happy. Regarding a house husband I have recently hired one. I have said for years that all I needed was a wife so I hired a local mom who comes over 4 mornings a week, cleans, cooks, runs errands, etc. $20/hr. It's cheaper than a marriage, pre-nup, and I don't have to care for anyone's else's aging parents. Maybe I'm cold or maybe I'm just practical. "
"Constant joking. I've known a few guys like this, where literally everything they said was a joke (well not even a joke, more like a prank on me) and I couldn't have a conversation with them at all. 

For example:

Him (after two bites of the meal): Here, I can't eat another bite, you finish it. 

Me: Really? 

Him: Hahaha no are you crazy, I never leave food. My mom used to beat me if I didn't finish my plate. 

Me: Oh my gosh, I'm sorry...

Him: Hahaha just kidding, I love my mom. Btw I hope you don't drink any booze tonight, cus I'm a recovering alcoholic. Just kidding haha! Your expression was so funny.

If you can't just sit down and share stuff about yourself in a normal conversation, something's up. "

"This happened to my friend this week. 

She went to say goodbye to her father. He was in the hospital after a severe health decline and had a DNR. He slipped into a coma. Docs couldn't do anything so they sent him home to die. 

She brought her mother home from the Alzheimer unit to say goodbye. Everyone was crying and waiting for him to pass. 

Mom shuffled up to him and yelled, ""C'MON FRANK! STOP SLEEPING. WE HAVE TO GO TO THE STORE.""

He woke up and started talking to her. He was just fine. He's still alive. "
"My mother saved me when I was a baby.  As she tells it, she was having a bad dream about a clogged pipe and could hear me crying. In reality, I had gotten down from the bed in the dark early morning and started playing with the electric blanket dial.  This was 1987, so it was just a piece of round plastic held on by a screw with a metal washer.  Well little me thought it would be super fun to put  the washer into my mouth, and it got stuck blocking my airway.  I was not crying, just wobbling around on the carpeted floor making no noise. 

My dad says it can't have been more than 10 seconds from when I swallowed the washer to when mom woke up and grabbed me.  Not sure if that counts as intuition, but I'm very glad she had that nightmare."

"I was eighteen when I had surgery on my eyes to ""fix"" my lazy eye problem. It didn't actually improve my vision. I only see through one eye at a time, but that surgery was to strip a few muscles so my unused eye looks like it's looking straight ahead. So even though my insurance didn't consider it cosmetic, literally the only thing that had a hope of changing was my appearance.

People treated me much better ever since. I found it easier to make friends than ever before. And except for when I'm very tired or sick, my eyes still look normal seven years and two more eye conditions later.

So. Yes. Definitely worth it."
"My now-fiance met me at the tail end of my stepfathers fight with cancer. 

To say I was a mess is putting it really lightly. I didn't think I was in the right frame of mind to seriously commit to a relationship, and my fiance was fine with that. Instead, our ""dates"" consisted of spending time at my parents house, him getting to know my stepdad, helping my stepdad rebuild a bike he'd had since the 70's, and ""helping"" my stepdad do things around the house he could no longer do. He never once complained about it. These were things his biological daughter and son in law couldn't be bothered to do. 

A few days before my stepdad died, my fiance had went to pick up a milkshake for him (the only thing he'd eat) and while he was gone, my stepdad said, ""I'm sorry that I won't be here to see you two get married."" And it just confirmed everything I felt about him. 

He saw me at my absolute worst, when I was raw and grieving and *furious* at everything in the world. And he still stayed by me, he *threw* himself into this family and helped us get through one of the toughest things we've ever done. He had a choice not to, but he's a good person, and he's my person. 

5 and a half years later... We're planning our wedding.

This is very discriminating toward paleontologists who are often equipped with pickaxes. Please be mindful of the fact that not all pickaxe users are gold diggers. 
"The sensation of blorp when you stand up on your period and a chunk slides out of your vag.

Or when you stand up from peeing and the toilet bowl is full of red, like your spleen just dropped out of your butt.

Basically periods in general. Not glamorous. I respect people who have come to terms with theirs, however they manage, but I spend mine in a state of grumpiness that this is all happening."
I found my sister's ring on top of my packed bags when I was considering suicide.  I had watched her get buried with this ring over 10 years before and it is very distinctive.  
"After losing about 70 pounds, I got a tummy tuck and boob job. I had been overweight and self conscious about it since I was a kid, so it was worth every penny and the horrible recovery! 

Edit: Before and after: http://imgur.com/X29SG0O
The before is the photo my surgeon took before the TT. The after is about a yr after the boob job and about 5 years after the tummy tuck."
"It becomes very obvious early on. Saying things like, ""Nice car"" or asking what you do for a living is one thing, but when all of a sudden they ""forget"" their wallet when you go out, or drop hints that you should take them on a vacation, or start talking about things they'd love to do with you but can't afford, etc. 

*Apparently a lot of ppl misunderstood. I don't think saying 'nice car' is a sign of a gold-digger at all, nor is noticing possessions or anything else. That's why I said ""Saying 'nice car' is one thing, BUT..."" and then gave examples of things that might tip you off. (ie, asking to be brought along on a trip with no plans to pay their way, expecting you to pay all the time when you go out, etc) "
"I don't know about more often, but the stereotype that women are too emotional. Every time I read Trump's tweets I'm can't believe that even during the election there were ""arguments"" that Hilary wasn't fit to lead because *women* are irrationally emotional....."
"I walked up to a very attractive man in a coffee shop with my number written down on it on a day where I purposefully looked very very good. I smiled, introduced myself and handed him my number and said ""I would like to get to know you"" and left.
I was 18. I didn't get a call.




I was at a bar, saw a man I wanted sitting with a few friends. When his friends left I sat down beside him and asked if I could buy him another beer (it was almost finished) he kinda looked me up and down and simply said ""not interested"".
I was probably just 21 at that point.



And when I was 20, I met a guy through a class I took and worked my way up to where I thought we were flirting and having fun. So I tried to ask him to come to my dorm for dinner.
He kinda looked at me weird and went ""sorry, I'm going on a date tonight""

These are just a few examples, but I have dozens hahaha"

"Playing hide and seek with huge family at a campsite. I am wondering around looking for a place to hide when I spot my mom hiding behind a bush, facing our campsite. I come up behind her and whisper ""hey mom!"" and she screams. She tells me that right before I came up behind her, she was watching me hide underneath our travel trailer. My brother says he saw me hiding under the travel trailer too, but I never hide there that night. 

We went back a year later, and I got terribly sick and had to stay in the kids tent the whole time (I also forget my contacts/glasses, so I couldn't see more than a couple inches in front of me). My stepdad and step-uncle say they saw me walking around the campsite and watched me walk into the woods. ""I"" wouldn't respond to any of their calls. After alerting my mom, she said I was sleeping in the tent and couldn't be walking around because I was sick and basically blind. They checked on me and there I was, sleeping in the tent. We didn't go back after that last trip."
"Condensed version: On the fence about kids, birth control failed, had kid, realized after he was born that *on the fence* means *NO*, sucked it up and did the best I could. Marriage fell apart, disastrously, left when he turned physically abusive. Had my tubes tied asap. 

My only advice to people is, *Don't have kids unless you're 100% on board with it!*"
"What the heck. I work in labor and delivery and anyone who comes in saying they think they are in labor gets a monitor put on them immediately, even if they show up and say they are only contracting every 15 minutes. We put a monitor on them, check their cervix, and watch the monitor for at least 20 mins to see if the baby is okay and if we are picking up any contractions. I've never had a woman show up and get told to go home without even being looked at. I've even had women show up not claiming to be in labor, but just felt something ""wasn't right."" I never hesitate to throw those people on the monitor, if only for peace of mind. I don't want to be the one who laughed someone off, sent them home without checking, and find out their baby passed away and we could have prevented it. I am glad your sister stood her ground and that the baby ended up being okay."

"I'm married now, but back in the day I just didn't mention my income until I knew someone well. It wasn't to prevent gold diggers, it just seemed like a weird thing to mention. 

I don't dress or act ""rich"", and it's not immediately obvious from my lifestyle. I think if you're famous that's when you really have to watch out for gold-diggers. Or if you look super fancy! 

That said I think I told my wife pretty much everything on our first date. But we just clicked instantly and she was blatantly not a gold digger. (I also didn't realise it was a date, because I'm dumb)"
Female sounds clinical and cold. Dislike.
"Women are bad drivers

Insurance statistics state otherwise."
"With my daughter, I was labouring fine but then things started to feel wrong once they increased my dose of pitocin. The midwife put a monitor on and yelled at me for wasting her time until she realised that my baby's heart was having massive decelerations during each contraction. Baby was born inside 45 minutes and is fine.

My son... I didn't save his life, however there was one day he was super not himself and grizzly. I checked all the usual things and then felt I needed to check his feet inside his little socks. A loose thread had made a tourniquet around one of his toes, it was shiny swollen and dull purple. I definitely think I saved the toe."
"We were chatting on a balcony and he said ""well, it's late...I should get going."" And I said ""sure, but do you want to kiss me first?"" He did!"
Someone who can't admit or acknowledge when they're wrong is generally very insecure. Someone who is confident in their self will be fine with admitting they made a mistake because they're not trying to prove anything to anyone.

"Juniper, nickname Juni. I think it's SO cute, but I don't think I'd name a real kid that. "
"I quit using it and go by my more serious sounding middle name.  I seriously considered changing my name legally, but never got around to it.  When I moved to a new city I started introducing myself by it and my work acts like that's just my real name."
I think I do the opposite. I tend to compliment the other person on whatever I feel insecure about. If I can't feel comfortable I'd at least like to make the other person feel good about themselves.
"When I was super young, maybe kindergarten age, I thought it would be fun to open up my second bedroom window and climb out on the roof. 

My mom was downstairs on the phone with her friend and I was in my room on the second floor. No way for her to have known I had opened the window and screen and was halfway climbing out. She burst into my room in a panic and pulled me down. She said she just knew something was wrong. I'll never be able to explain that one. "

"I had a run of bad luck of online dating when I kept meeting guys who, I didn't know it until we met, didn't have any teeth.

That's a pretty big thing for them to leave off a profile or not mention.  ""By the way, I am edentulous."" 

I became good at hearing certain pronunciations when we first talked on the phone that pointed to someone who couldn't say certain words or sounds because they didn't have any teeth."
"Wait, what? 

EDIT: Ohh, A shot! That makes much more sense :')"
"I have friends who are very interesting/entertaining because they travel constantly for work and whenever we see each other they have a lot of fun stories and things to share, we can compare notes on common places we've been, etc.  
  
I don't want to be in a relationship with someone who is away for long periods of time or extremely frequently."
"In college I asked a guy if he wanted to come up to my dorm room ""for a cup of tea"" (it was a dry dorm) after a party. It was like 11pm.  

He came up.  

We had actual tea.  This was extra awkward, because I only had one mug, so I had to dump all my pens out of my pen cup and use that for myself. 

Since my ""tea"" plan was taken at ludicrous face value, I was like ""Clearly I have to be more obvious"".  I put my hand on his knee, head on his lap, and escalated until I basically laid across his lap-- and he just casually conversed with me and sort of politely accommodated whatever I was doing like he was letting me get comfortable. Then it was 2am and he's like ""well, this was fun but I am going to go home and sleep"".  

Ugh.  I'm fairly sure he was just naive and not really rejecting me, but man.  I should have thrown in the towel at literal tea.

"My fiancé who passed away 16 years ago.

**Trigger warning**

Backstory: Valentines day 2001 - 17 days after my 21st birthday, 4 days shy of the closing date of the house he &amp; I'd just bought. I'd left work early with a migraine, and didn't have the energy nor the ability to do anything that day, so I told him that I was going to just sleep that night. He said okay, and that he was going to hang out with his friends. A few hours later, he called and asked if I needed anything and to let me know he was on his way home. I went back to sleep. Sometime a little later, I heard him come in, so I rolled over and saw him taking off his coat etc., and again went back to sleep. Next thing I remember was a loud *boom* in my ear, that startled me out of sleep, so I rolled over and found him lying in the bed next to me - half of his head was blown off and he died on the way to the hospital.

-
***If I could talk to him again,*** I would ask him if he shot himself on purpose. Though it's been 16 years, and I've told myself many times that it was an accident and that he was cleaning his gun, I really don't know. There's this piece of me, a lingering doubt in the back of my mind that says otherwise, and that he killed himself on purpose. 


-
***If it was intentional, I would ask him*** why he did it. Was it something that I did/didn't do? Could I have prevented it? Was he depressed? Were there signs that I'd missed?

-
I replay that day over in my mind more often than most people realize, and more often than I admit. It's affected me and my life more than anyone could possibly imagine, and I have no idea why it happen, or even, if it were intentional or not.

-
I don't need to tell him that I love him since believe it or not, those were the last words we spoke to each other when we got off the phone - so he knew that. I just really want to know why/how it happened &amp; whether it was something that I did to cause it or if I could have stopped it.

"I like it when men are selfish in bed. That sounds absurd I know but, my thing is pleasing. That's all I really like. Pleasing someone else makes me feel really good, and enjoy sex. So when he is selfish and just uses me for his pleasure and focuses on himself, it makes me feel fucking amazing. No amount of vanilla sex, rough sex, or attempted orgasm will ever meet that feeling for me."
"Oh snap! Let him in, it triggers a series of side quests"
"I had awful warts (think 30+ of them) removed from my hands with laser surgery when I was a teenager. I was so self conscious about them and people always commented horribly about them. They took ages to heal and I still have some scars, but they never regrew so it was very much worth it for me."
"I could be myself around him and didn't get sick of him. 


In public I am a well put together woman who is social and active and outgoing. Who wears makeup and does her hair. 


The real me is a lazy makeup-less gamer/otaku who would live off sushi, pizza, grilled meat, potato chips, and rum if I was allowed to. Who hates people and in reality I'm a pretty shit person. 


He told me he only truly fell for me when he saw me ""off"".

He is also the only person who doesn't require energy to be with. It's like he recharges my battery. "
"This is a little silly but my BF had been bugging me to get him a fish tank for his bday/christmas and I vehemently told him no no no, that's stupid, no. Well this year for his bday I got him a fish tank....aaaaaaaand now I'm more into it than he is. I already want a bigger tank and all kinds of fish, I can't go to the store to buy something to treat the tank without coming back with a new ornament, plant, snail or fish...I think I need help. "
Taking forever in the bathroom. Idk what they're doing in there but I've never taken half an hour to poo.

"One girl I was stuck with in high school (terrible person by the way) would say ""I only hang out with (blank name) and (blank name) because they're fat cunts. So I look better when I'm seen with them"". She would keep ""uglier"" women around so people would say she's more attractive. Her putting women down all the time showed how insecure she was. "
"It's often very reasonable. I think a lot of people don't realize how financially and mentally difficult raising a child with certain birth defects can be, but I understand that it can sound kind of eugenics-y. If my child were born with a disability, I would do whatever I could to take care of them, but if I knew beforehand that they'd have something like Down's or worse, I would most likely have an abortion. My fiance's side of the family has carriers of Tay-Sachs and luckily he's not, but it is an awful, cruel disease and there is no way I'd bring a child into the world knowing they have that. 

I don't think it's anything people should be mandated to do, however. It's a decision the parents should make for themselves because ultimately they're the ones who will be responsible. "
"My first kid kept throwing up a lot. It wasn't a big deal at first, but she kept getting worse and worse. She couldn't keep anything down. I got scared. Everyone kept telling me babies throw up all the time, it's normal, even my husband said this. We went for a well baby check and I told the doctor what was going on. I got the spiel again. It's your first baby, babies throw up. I kept pushing. He reluctantly sent us to the ER. So we went, had them check her out. They had me feed her a bottle in front of them. She kept it down for a bit. They told us to sit tight and ignored us for about an hour. Then she threw up. More than they had me feed her. That's when they started paying attention to her. We were transferred to the pediatric wing and the doctors there flipped out. Because she was extremely dehydrated and her blood work was terrible. I got yelled at because why didn't I go to the doctor, my baby was dying.  After being transferred to a children's hospital in the next state over and getting a million tests, they diagnosed her with pyloric stenosis. Thankfully it was a very simple surgery and her recovery went smoothly.  

I will never forget how powerless I felt. I was begging for help and no one listened. I knew something was horribly wrong and nobody took me seriously. If we hadn't gone to the ER when we did, my daughter would have died. It's rare, what happened to her. Pyloric stenosis happens more often to boys and is often diagnosed in newborns.  My daughter was three months old when she had her surgery.  On the bright side, we immediately found a new and better pediatrician and my husband hasn't ever doubted me again when it comes to our children's health. She's doing really well 6 years later and only has three tiny dots on her belly from her surgery. "
"they love and worship the crap out of you. they carefully lean back and listen to what you're looking for, and magically become everything you're looking for. and *you're* everything they're looking for, you perfect being you!

of course, it's not completely over the top and is done with a bit more subtlety. they might not reveal that you have everything in common/they're everything you're looking for in one convo, but spaced apart to where it looks organic (''oh wow i like xyz too!'' one week, ''let me display how much i fit into your idea of the ideal partner'' the next).

there's a huge rush to commit right away, meet parents, etc. if you try to slow down, all you hear is ''but we're perfect together, you've been fucked around by so many others that you're just scared to be treated right/meet a guy who commits.'' or ''but i feel like i've known you forever!''. it still feels shady, but the nervous energy and intensity is just too addictive to walk away from, even if the rational part of you wants to say ''he doesn't know me, so he can't really love me yet'' or better yet ''i don't know him, what the fuck am i doing''.

if you have low self esteem, it feels too good to have so much smoke blown up your ass. you don't believe all of it, but if they love you THIS FREAKING MUCH, you have to be a bit better than you thought, right? to walk away would be to discard your new value."

"My then new college friend asked me if we could continue hanging out, ""you know, as friends"". I could tell he liked me. I said ok.

The next day I asked him if he wanted to have sex. He said yes, and we did.

It actually typically works haha but one time I had a guy in my car at night and I stopped in a parking lot (long story, we were trying to look for bats in the area) and I had him explain something so dumb to me and I delivered my killer line and he just said ""...okay"" and kinda laughed but he thought I was joking so I was just like ""haha okay"" and then we didn't make out. The rest of the drive was incredibly awkward. "
"This one time I was in a bar and this really cute guy kept clocking me. So I was making googly eyes back at him. This went on for about three hours, until my friends decided to go somewhere else. I thought, right - it's now or never. So I sidled up to him and said ""Hey, I've noticed we've sort of been looking at each other all evening. Would you like to swap phone numbers and maybe go out for a drink some time?""

He went, ""No."" Not ""No, I actually have a girlfriend"". Not ""Oh, sorry, I'm not actually interested - it's just that your skirt was tucked into your knickers all night."" Just ""No"" and silence. I didn't know what to do so I shook his hand, told him he was a very handsome man, and left.

I can never go back to that bar again and it's one of those memories that makes you physically shudder when it creeps into your head at 2am.

Edit: I'm pretty shocked by the number of people who think that I handled that well! Thanks for the support guys, though I can guarantee this was way less smooth IRL than you're imagining 😅"
Poop roulette is a good name for it! 
My name was Cinnamon when I was born. My mom changed her mind at the last second when doing up the birth certificate though. And then they spelled my new name wrong. 
"I was young and not sure I was ready to commit forever to him.  So I spent about six months silently comparing him to every single other male I met.  I was at college, so there were a lot around.  I found that no one was anywhere near as kind, sweet, good looking, and smart as him.  There was no question that he was the one for me.  So at 19 I decided I wanted to be with him forever, we became engaged at 20, and we married at 22.  Just celebrated 16 years of marriage."
"If I see a mouse on the ground, I jump down to try to catch it. Years of working in a research lab, if someone dropped a mouse, you quickly try to pick it up. 

I was parking my bike downtown and saw a little field mouse slowly walking by. I was halfway down to it when I realized I shouldn't try to pick up wild mice. "

"Oh god this was me a few months ago. I'm so far left and my boyfriend is a bit right of center but a huge gun nut, and I was afraid of shooting with him partly because I don't like guns at all and partly because I was afraid of being wrong about them. He's got a bunch of them varying from little handguns to an AR and he finally took me to his range, and taught me how to shoot all of them. Accidentally ended up loving it.  "
"I went on a Tinder date in January that went poorly. At the end he tried to kiss me so I dodged, tripped over a curb, and broke my fibula while falling into traffic. The guy got down in the road with me, moved my hair behind me ear and said ""we could tell people that we fell in love"".
"
"I like my birthmark right under my breast. It looks like a brown potato. I call her Spud. She has a tiny dark mole inside that looks like a moon's shadow cast on its planet. 

I have another brown birthmark about 5 inches down from Spud. She's oddly shaped. I call her Hyperion, which is the name of Saturn's irregulary shaped moon. She's the one casting her shadow on Spud."

"Married now. In my 20's when I was dating, I had a well paying job, a trust fund worth then about $500k plus knew I had inheritances coming.

I know this sounds cynical - but I didn't date poor guys. Avoiding gold diggers was easy because I dated guys who seemed likely to end up in a similar financial place to me-- with or without my money. Partially because that's who my school, job, and social circle brought me into contact with, but really because that's who I had stuff in common with. Traveled a lot as a kid? Check. Good college? Check. Went to a Camp vs went camping? Check. These were guys I had stuff in common with and similar expectations about life. 

I know everyone loves a fairy tale, but in reality, Cinderella and the Prince probably didn't have a hell of a lot to talk about. People tend to date and marry people like them.  My husband is basically my male twin. We both come from dual-income upper middle class households. Divorced parents. Good (Ivy League in his case, top 50 in mine) colleges. Dads were both doctors. Neither of us had college debt. Both of us are WASP-y savers who would not be caught dead carrying a Louis Vuitton handbag or popping bottles at a nightclub because that is what tacky people do. We are both hard workers who were brought up believing our job was to work even harder because we were lucky. We get each other. 

My best friend is a high-achiever from a shitty family. She grew up poor-ish. Not like canned beans every meal for dinner, but like lower middle class and full of siblings who make bad decisions about the law, having kids, money, etc. She worked her ass off, was valedictorian of her high school, and got the hell out of the small industrial town she was from and never looked back. She went to medical school and married a guy EXACTLY like her-- first in his family to go to college, his parents didn't even speak english, sister got pregnant at 16, etc. I love her to death but we think fundamentally differently about everything financial. She and her husband-- they get each other. 

Back to dating-- I never mentioned anything about money until I knew I was very serious about my husband. Neither did he. I always paid for my half of dates. I lived in a nice-ish apartment for my age, but I definitely did not flaunt it. Neither did he. When I met him, he probably was making $100k a year with investments (do keep in mind this was 15 years ago) and driving a used base model Honda. I also never touched the money for living expenses. It was drilled into me repeatedly that that that was wealth, not spending cash. We had a serious financial talk after dating for about 4 years. At that point, we were very serious and both clearly thinking about getting married. That's the first time I ever mentioned the $500k to him. 

TL; DR: Did not date poor guys."
"I saved my daughter from Kawasaki disease . She had a fever for about a week and her doctor kept saying it was a uti. 
She did not get better with medication and started getting weird rashes on her face from tears, her bottom from going potty and saliva when she ate. 
It freaked me out so we got a second opinion. 
The Doctor was so confused. He left the room and came back with a book. Told me that he personally knew the doctor that was investigating this disease and told me to go to the ER at the hospital she was at . 
I packed a bag and left. Turns out she could've gotten an aneurism in her heart or died if I waited any longer from this disease. 7 years later I still have a healthy little girl!!"
"This isn't as spooky as some of the other tales, but it makes me feel weird when I think about it. I've never been married or engaged. I've never been a jewelry person, especially not rings (partially because I find them uncomfortable, but also because I worked in a cafe for years and it wouldn't have been practical)... But for about a week period, I had three separate moments where I would panic suddenly, paired with the distinct thought that I had sat my wedding ring down somewhere and left it. I'd feel really silly immediately afterwards, though, and a little unnerved--I mean, marriage status isn't exactly a trivial thing that slips a person's mind."

"Last year I was at my mom's house helping her do chores. My mom and 5 year old son were outside playing. I was vacuuming around the litter box, and my 9 month old daughter was crawling around in the next room. I felt something was off and turned around while I was vacuuming. My daughter had gotten a hold of a piece of dog toy fluff. There were two large clumps connected by a thin strand of string. She had managed to swallow one clump of fluff and the second was stuck. Her lips were starting to turn purple and she was trying to cough it out. I picked her up, laied her down on my knee, and did the Heimlich maneuver on her. I got the fluff clump out with in seconds, but it feels like time stopped for a moment and I just went into rescue mode. "
"The idea of being with one person for the rest of my life - never having a first kiss again, never feeling that spark of early romance, never going through the process of getting to know someone so intimately for the first time - terrifies and even depresses me a little."

"Not saying this is true of the population at large, but from what I've experienced, women are always stereotyped as the ones who won't say what's on their mind and will let it build up until they explode. But I'll be damned if me and most if not all of my straight female friends have dealt with guys letting things build up and not talking about them AT ALL until they just break up out of the blue. "
"You were quiet, every time my kid does something scary she's quiet. The realisation that there is none of the usual playful noises slowly builds up on you until it hits your brain like a shock. Then you go in to crazy kid tracking mode.

Source: my daughter keeps climbing out her window. We got the landlord to put a restrictor on, the gap wasn't ~~big~~small enough and she escaped 3 times in one week. Since then we've put an alarm on and it really scared her the next time she made a bid for freedom, told her the police put it there. Not had any escapes since. Just want to point out I'm trying my best and not a neglectful parent :p

"I was raised mostly vegetarian and for a long time was afraid to try meat because I thought I might like it. I did try it though, and it turns out a. I don't and b. my body REALLY doesn't. I will spare you the details but let's just say I have great incentive to never do that again."
"I had jaw surgery. It wasn't entirely cosmetic because my jaws had grown in such a way that my teeth didn't line up correctly and it caused me some pain. But the end result was that I ended up looking much better, which was nice. Totally worth it for me. My teeth are in the right places, I don't have any more jaw pain, and I look better."
"Knew a girl whose name was ""Rainbow"". Honestly, she loved it and it suited her! She also went by ""Rain""or ""Rainy"". A lot of puns, sure - but nothing mean and it never affected her adult life. "
"Childbirth and post partum. People talk about the pain and how amazing it is that our bodies can do this, but they rarely talk about how *gross* it can be. There's amniotic fluid, blood, and goo. There's a lot of sweat and tears. Many women poop while pushing, and many women vomit at some point (usually during transition) and for me at least, the vomiting happened with no warning so it was quite messy. Then there's the placenta, which is a truly weird feeling when that comes out. 

Then, you bleed heavily for a few days. And when I say heavy, I mean you'll have 2 giant maxi pads kinda layered inside those super stretchy mesh underwear they give you at the hospital, you're still probably gonna leak so you're sitting on those puppy training pads. You pass large clots and each trip to the bathroom takes several minutes to clean up because wiping hurts like hell. Then you bleed like a period for a couple weeks and it slowly tapers off into yellowish brown discharge which lasts another couple weeks. 

And as your hormones regulate, you will be so sweaty. I'm told it doesn't matter how hot or cold the weather is, you're gonna sweat after you give birth. Then there's your boobs, which will ache and become engorged as the milk comes in. They leak, your nipples can get sore and even cracked/chapped. And this can last for days/weeks as your body regulates. "

"Get out and do your hobbies. After enough years my friends groups started having overlap because I had become a part of so many awesome communities.

"And then it's ""well women make more mistakes, but men get in more collisions."" Maybe we should consider how you're defining ""mistake"" if that's the case..."
"For me, personally, the whole ""Women want to vent"" thing is true, BUT it's true for him, too. See, the thing is, by the time we get to ""solution mode,"" I've already allowed him the space, grace, and time to vent away. I sometimes do not get that same courtesy, so he goes immediately into ""let's fix this"" mode, but... when it's his problem, he gets venting THEN problem solving. So it's not that I like venting MORE than him, it's that he gets that by default

TL;DR - venting. We ALL, as in social animals, need it. It's just that, in my personal experience, women give it more without being told that ""I just need to talk"" "
"I absolutely hate ""female"" when it's used as a noun. It sounds so disparaging and dehumanizing. I see it on Reddit and even Facebook. On Reddit, I see guys using it who refer to women as ""females"" but will refer to guys as ""men"" in the same sentence. Then on Facebook, I see men use it to complain about women.  The women I see using it on Facebook also use it when complaining about women. I also rarely see anyone referring to men as ""males"" as well. 

My ex would even say shit like, ""females are bad at driving."" Or, if a woman did something bad in his eyes, he'd have an irritated expression and be like ""Females"" in a really irritated tone. I don't know, I just hate the word since it's become so commonplace to use it instead of just saying ""women."" I'll never understand why it's so hard to just say ""women."""

"Honestly I think that the only real necessities for being a feminist is the belief that women should be equal to men, and the belief that in our current society they currently aren't and that needs to change.

There are women who believe that abortion is wrong who dedicate their entire lives to building schools for girls and fighting against femicide in the third world.  There are women who had some kinda shitty intersectional views who gave up everything for my right to vote.  All these people are feminists.  Feminist doesn't have to mean ""person I totally agree with"" to me in order for it to be a meaningful label.

I can think someone is a shitty person with regressive opinions and still consider them a feminist."

It assumes you don't have obligations like family (kids, aging parents, etc.) or health issues.

It also assumes that people want the same things out of life that you do.

Fortunately my pregnancy chemical levels were just fine and the blood was probably just left over from my last menstrual.

Ingrown hairs on your bikini line and labia that turn into giant gross puss filled boils for those of us who are not blessed with nice fine hair despite a wide variety of solitions and perfect hygene- no some of us are not mant to be hairless.

And then getting shitty comments from partners who do expect it... Enjoy that picture, mofos :3

passing clots. OH SHIT. DID I LOSE MY WHOLE UTERUS????? oh.. no, just a clot. huh... it's big and weird. Imma poke at it. poke... poke...

My feet look nasty. I should take a fucking cheese grater to it. 

Oh shit I need to wear a dress. Let me stuff myself into a giant polyester sausage casing before I put it on. Additionally, just because this doesn't inhibit my movement enough, let me jam some spikes on the bottom of my feet. Spikes that will surely require me to use a cheese grater on my feet at a future point in time. Plus- I'll basically have to sit down all night. I want a drink? Nah- someone will have to get it for me because otherwise I'm likely to severely injure myself. 

Birth control- I can take some responsibility for my own reproduction but none of it is guaranteed and so many of them can cause side effects ranging from severe discomfort to lack of sexual desire (that's one way to stop pregnancy) to strokes or blood clots or headaches or weight gain or... the list goes on. Not to mention the whole concept of jamming a piece of metal into you that might at some point work its way out and through your uterine wall, into your intestine and beyond. WTF. 

Makeup. It's glamourous until it's not. You sleep over at a friends house too drunk? Good morning mysterious human shaped raccoon. So Saxxxy

Extentions- holy shit. No sure I'll glue or tie plastic or other hair  into my hair that will ruin my follicles and if I do it enough, ensure I go bald. That's a good idea. woo. 

Straightening and curling. I don't have to tie shit in there but I'm certainly capable of destroying my own strands with stupid amounts of heat daily. yay. 

Long term straightening or perms- lets chemically kill my natural hair. 

ok.. this is depressing me. Clearly not all people are going to have all side effects of any particular issue- but they're not especially uncommon. And these are only some. THIS IS NOT A COMPREHENSIVE LIST And I do some of them. Because I feel like it's expected and sometimes I like whatever the beneficial result is- but holy shit when you put it all in one place- yikes. 

I feel like the hottest chick on earth right now, btw. Thanks OP. You're on my shit list :P

I used to work for ATT and during the iphone launches they would hire old retired LAPD offers to be our security.  We were too busy to take breaks so my husband brought my then 4 year old to the store for a quick visit.  While there my son said he had to go to the bathroom and since he had been there before he knew where it was. I got a weird feeling and followed him to the bathroom. He opened the door but because it was heavy it slipped out of his hand and I grabbed it and pulled it open. As I glanced into the bathroom I saw a huge Dirty Harry style hand gun sitting in the back on the toilet.  The old security guard had left it there after going.  At the time my son was obsessed with guns and fighting so it would have been a tragedy.  I blocked the door and yelled for the store manager and the guard was immediately fired.  Just typing this out makes me ill.

The most direct conversation I can remember us having about race was when I was 10. My mom thought I should already like boys because she's nuts, and she started asking me if I had any boy friends at school. I mentioned a Ryan Gomez, and then Rob Wilson. Mom asked me if Rob was white, and I said he was black. She went quiet, then told me ""it's fine for you to have school friends like this, but you need to know if you ever bring home a boy who isn't white, your dad will shoot him. We're not racist, it's just that these cultures don't mix and you can never have a good marriage with someone from a different culture."" 

I'm 30 now and I still very much think of myself as unlearning the shit I grew up with. I resisted the overtly racist stuff my parents said from the time I was 11 or so, but the covert stuff has been harder for me to find and weed out."
"This makes a lot of sense now. I'll often tease my wife when I see her walking to the bathroom, I'll ask ""are you gonna poop?"" just to embarrass her a little, and she'll always respond ""I don't know yet!""

I always thought she was just sort of joking."
"I was leaving to live on the other side of the country for 6 months, it was our last night together and it was New Year's Eve. We weren't even dating at that point, we had been sleeping together. I was incredibly sick, could barely walk, we had had plans to go out but obviously I wasn't able to do any of it. He let me sleep in his bed all afternoon while he made me soup and tea and took care of me. He could have done anything, picking up chicks or going out with his best friend, and instead he took care of his fwb who was leaving for six months. And then I left the next morning and it felt like I was being ripped in half. We've been living together for two years now. "
"A piece of one of my puzzles ended up in a friend's car. They texted me a photo of it asking if I was missing something, but my puzzle was already completely put together. 
It was the only duplicate puzzle piece in the whole box and it randomly ended up in my friend's car. 

A few years later, the puzzle had been taken apart and boxed up after a move. As I was helping the same friend pack up some of his stuff, we found the same puzzle piece and it's matching piece in one of his drawers. I have absolutely no explanation for it. 

The puzzle is now in a frame in my living room, with the extra piece in its own frame so it can't bounce around anywhere again. "
"I'm not objectively rich, but I'm in a far better financial position than my peers.

And I don't tell anyone this. It hasn't even arrived at the point of being a dating strategy, it just makes things awkward if people know."
"I was messing with his wallet and found a condom. I said, ""I know what we can use this for."" He said, ""Yep."" That was about as far as that conversation went. We didn't talk again. "
I tore by bicep tendon grabbing the rail of the bed and needed surgery to repair it.
"Not my child, but my niece. She was almost 2 years old. I was at my sister's house making some food and suddenly I had a gut feeling that something was wrong, so I went to check on the kids. She had a ball stuck in her mouth and was choking. I immediately ran to her, reached into her mouth, and pulled out the ball. Afterwards I just held her for an hour. It was terrifying. "
"I have a single, blonde hair on my stomach that grows, no joke, probably 4"" long."
"So, one time I was rock climbing with a friend of mine, and in the middle of a climb he started shouting at me which holds to grab.  I wanted to figure it out on my own, so I said ""That's ok!  I got it!""

The next time he did it, I said ""Don't do that please!  I like figuring it out!""

The third time he did it, it was right as I was about to do that exact same thing, and my spontaneous feeling of anger caused me to misjudge the distance and miss the hold.  As I swung from the toprope I yelled at him, ""DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO.""

When I came down, he was like ""Girl I love you, but you're crazy.""  I said, ""What do you mean?""  He said ""You went from zero to yelling at me in like a second.""  I said, ""Did you not notice the 2 times before this where I politely asked you not to give me beta?""  And he was like "".... oh shit!  No I didn't!"" and never hassled me about that again.

I swear to god, I think a lot of that stereotype is just dudes either not noticing or willfully ignoring polite straightforward communication until it gets to explosion level."
"My name is Sunny. When my mom was pregnant with me she kept singing ""You are my sunshine"" to me while I was in her belly. I haven't really found that my name hinders me much professionally or as an adult. I have a pretty bubbly and optimistic disposition so a lot of people remark that my name matches my personality."
He grabbed my hand and put it on his dick during the appetizer course. There was no second date and there was no entree course.
Oh god this is hilariously specific bad luck.

"I'm too busy being rich to date - hah. I don't mean travelling and lounging by my pool (I do not own a pool), I mean working."
"What i noticed more (and i was single for a very long time) is that two of my very good but eternally single friends care way too much about external things in guys - their looks, their status, having compatible hobbies etc. All i care for these days is: is he kind, loyal and gives me space. Don't care about education background, job, body type, clothes, if he owns his own place. So part of what some might call settling is growing up and seeing what is important. But i do also think it's important to respect your self worth ""does this relationship make me feel good"")"

"I have a budget with a ""spending money"" line item. When I'm out of spending money, I can't spend any money until the next month.

I have a system where I input everything superfluous I buy (like a fitbit band, or a coke, or a burger, whatever) into a google form and every day I get an email telling me how much my allowance for the day is

     (total_spending_allowed - money_spent)/days_left_in_month

and then try not to spend more than that, it's like a game."
"I ain't saying he a gold sifter..

"That there's a not insignificant part of me that wants to spend some years alone. 

Living alone. Not having the comfort of falling asleep/waking up next to someone. Struggling without knowing there's someone there to back me up, or someone waiting in the wings. 

The worst part is it has nothing to do with him. He's great. Basically perfect, even. But I've been in monogamous relationships all my life... I don't even know who I am when I'm not tethered to someone and I don't like that fact, not one bit. But who knows, it's probably just grass is greener syndrome. I try to work through these feelings by journaling and mindfulness. "
"haha.  I went through phases.  Sometimes I feel like that, sometimes especially as a teenager I felt like being extra 'Daria' in response to it."
And the band nerds will say he's sharp. I feel like that makes up for it.

"My dad was over visiting one day. We were mid conversation, when I suddenly felt my stomach drop. Rushed to the kitchen to see my toddler holding a steak knife, which was in a drawer I didn't realize he could reach. Needless to say all knives were moved immediately.

"Yep. Strangers have stopped their cars on the street to tell me (1) my dog is beautiful or (2) my son is handsome. People will come up to my sister to tell her she's beautiful.

"Not surgery, but after considering them for years, I had hair extensions put in six months ago. I take a medication for a chronic health issue that's caused my hair to thin, and as a result, i can't grow it past my shoulders. I'd always had long hair up to my 40s when I began taking this med. Now, at 51, I can wear my hair at a mid-back length, not to mention having it look healthy and full again for the first time in years. It's done so much to make me feel like myself again. It's changed my life and I highly recommend extensions for women in a similar situation - totally worth the cost and maintenance for me. "

"If you are not lonely, or feeling like you are missing something, you are just practical. Live how you want. 

I will say that I do OK, financially, (am 46) and I have no interest in 22 year olds. And I would wager there are other men like that.

That being said, separating the wheat from the chaff at this point? I can see how it's kind of not worth it."
"He might but he most likely won't, because he is a person with solid character and moral judgements and will likely either leave me or end the potential situation before it happens. You don't fall in love all at once - there are stages that you consent to and continue moving forward. Once you decide to continue the situation that is falling in love forward, it's cheating anyways. 


I, of course, have no guarantees. But that's what trust is, and having faith in the person you love. "
"I think the main thing to keep in mind is that it's better to think of it as supplementary to other learning resources, rather than a fully comprehensive course. So my tips are to do other things as well as DuoLingo, like reading other-language newspaper articles, using podcasts, and even kids' shows/movies (tend not to speak as fast and involve a bit less vocab, so pretty good for beginners)."
I think its pretty essential if you want to be smart and be properly prepared for the future.   
"I can admire someone who is very committed to certain careers.  For example, a medical professional whose job is their life.  Or someone working on a valuable scientific question who is obsessed with answering it.  Even a teacher.  But I do not like being with a career driven person.  I like being with a partner whose focus is mutual adventures, family, time with friends, etc.

My dad is a scientist and was obsessed with his work.  And I can admire it to an extent.  He's an absolutely brilliant human being and I appreciate that now.  But it was at the expense of time with my mother and with us kids and I hated that.  I just wanted him to spend time with me.

My ex husband was fixated on making money.  Fuck that.  My new husband is a librarian.  He cares very much about his job but when he comes home, he's home.  We're kind of poor, but I don't care.  Our life together is wonderful."

Edited to add: Oh, also washing my bras.  Which I didn't do um, ever? before."

"The moment I saw him and I realized he had lied about his height.

I want to make it really clear that it wasn't the height that's the problem, I actually like dating people my own length and have dated shorter men and it didn't even occur to me to have a problem with that.

The fact that he lied about something so obvious though made me wonder: does he think women are so stupid they can't see how tall you are?  Are you that insecure in general. What else did you lie about? etc. 

I did still have a coffee with him because I'm too polite I guess and didn't want to add to any potential issues, but I knew it wasn't going to work before we even said hello. "
I think he's the one for me. I don't want to scare him though. When we first met I was really scared of commitment and I think that I scared him from being too serious with me. Now that I know him better (and have traveled with him and done so much) I know he's my person

"Okay so throwaway account. I come from a lot of family money. My grandparents have a boatload of money from land ownership and years of old money and then my dad went on to be wildly successful in a completely different industry. At this point I could live forever off my trust from my grandparents. And that isn't even my full inheritance. That isn't even considering my parents money. With that I would never need work work another day in my life and neither would my Imaginary children and their imaginary children. My parents are on some rich people lists and their net worth is on Google. 

Anyways, like the other poster said, I prefer to date folks who also come from money. It doesn't have to be a ton of money but just some money. And for the same reasons the other poster said. 

Dealing with gold diggers is only sometimes a concern for me. I live in a different area of the country that my family does and that my family is from. It's not super far, but it's enough that I don't have any name recognition where I am. In my home city it is very very well known that my family is wealthy. One side of my family has lived in the city for a few generations and had a lot of successful kids. When I go home to visit it's a bit weird tbh. I get asked very frequently if I can get someone a job or if my dad can get them a good job. Like several times a day. I know people in my hometown look at me like some cash cow and I would honestly never date someone from there. 

My sister still lives there and she is in a horrible relationship with a shitty dude and I'm 99% sure he is just still sticking it out for the money and vacations. 

Also many people who have less money feel like they should get some of it for nothing or are mean about it. I've had the term 'daddy's money' thrown at me more times than I could ever count. It's fine that people think that way but I'm not going to actively put people who use it against me in my personal life. 

Anyways, in my regular day to day life nobody knows I'm wealthy and it's not a problem. I don't reveal it at all. I have a small but nice and new condo so I don't live extravagantly by any means. I rarely have people over anyways but I try to avoid it because I have some really nice family heirlooms in there that give away my bank account. People aren't recognizing me in public or anything so people know as much about me as I reveal to them. 

I go on some pretty cool vacations and have travelled a ton but I don't really tell anyone about that unless they specifically ask. I typically go on a big family vacation somewhere every summer and winter but we usually don't post much on social media or tell too many people about the details. 

I am single but I try to meet dudes who are a bit wealthy because our lifestyles will mesh. 

Also this is awful to say but it's also kinda easy to notice wealthy people/old money by their look, habits, hobbies, lifestyle. Not everybody obviously. 

My family also hangs out with other wealthy folks in the country that we have met through vacation/philanthropy/ work/ clubs/ education etc and I try to meet dudes through those connections or events. I like if my potential dates have been vetted through my social circle. 

If i meet a rando dude I think is cute and want to maybe date I make small talk that may give me clues. I ask them about hobbies work etc. I am going out of a date with a guy next week and I know that his family has a cottage and a boat not too far away and a place in Italy so I know he has money. My family has a place in Italy not too far away so it's kinda fun to talk about that!

I also try to meet dudes who work hard. Like I want to know they don't take it for granted. I work a lot and I want someone who also works a lot. For a lot of wealthy ppl there is a culture of hard work and it's not so much a 9-5 mentality and I need someone who understands why I immediately respond to emails when I get them even if it means it's at 11pm on a Friday. If somebody is super into their job it's more about the work than it is the money which I like.

Even though I try to date kinda wealthy dudes I really look for good financial management. There is no amount of money that can't be mismanaged and lost. So no stupid extravagant purchases or bad investment or lots of stupid material items. Those things add no value and just cost money. I use my money to make more money. I do not want to introduce a liability to my life. Nobody is worth losing my money over. 

Sorry this is long. There are a million more little things I could add. Hope this answered a bit of your question :)

Edit: I'm not sure where her family got the idea.  She is in her late-thirties, so any cultural reference would have to at least predate the early 1980's.  I think it is most likely that her family just thought it'd be funny with the family's last name."

"I have a very low tolerance for bullshit, especially from family members who already have a history of being shitty. 

My dad came out as gay when I was about eight years old. One day not long after that, he took my sister and me over to his parents' house to spend the weekend, but while we were there his dad came home, implied that Dad was here to antagonize his mother, and then told my Dad to wait in the driveway while he ""went in to get something"". Dad followed him into the house (where, by the way, my sister and I are hanging out in the living room), and a few minutes later came and told us to get in the car; we were getting the fuck out of there. (Later he said that his dad had gone to his gun safe. So that's nice.) I don't know if this really counts as cutting them out of my life because I was maybe nine years old at that point but eh. A few years ago Dad's dad died and he brought his mom a pretty bouquet of flowers (because the woman's husband had just fucking died) but she wouldn't open the door to him and later bragged about it to one of her other sons (the only one still friendly with Dad).

When I was eighteen, my mom died. I was still pretty estranged from my dad's entire side of the family because they're all ignorant redneck hicks. One of Dad's other brothers had been kind of close with my mom from time to time, though, so he showed up at her funeral. Fine. I'm not thrilled about it but whatever. After the service, he comes up to me *standing in front of my mom's casket* and says ""I'm sorry your dad's not a real man."" Like. What. Who says that *there*. Today is about celebrating the life of my blessed mother, you ignorant shitstain, not crowing about how disgusting The Gays are. I should have kicked him in the balls but instead I stormed off and hid in the bathroom while other family members ushered him out of the funeral home.

I'm done with just about everyone on that side of the family. "

"This was not my child.  I was in the city some years ago.  I had my youngest in a backpack and was spending part of the day running errands.  I was in a music store picking out some gifts for my SO.  The store was crowded, and there was a couple of girls around 12 looking around.  A guy was standing near them, talking to them.  They seemed at ease and I thought father maybe.  No big deal.  One girl left the store and the other was still looking. When I was ready to check out she was ahead of me in line.  As she was reaching for her purse the man came up close beside her and told her to put her money away, that he was getting her stuff for her.  She thanked him happily, and acted a bit surprised.  He was dressed dad-casual, he looked like any okay guy in his early 40s.  He was right behind her as they left, and I followed soon after.  I expected her to get in a car with him, I was still thinking dad-daughter.  She has seemed at ease with him, and the way he talked when paying for her things seemed okay.  But she did not.  She went one way, walking and turned the corner onto a side street towards a residential area.  He got into his car and drove off.  Hmm, I thought. And then he turned the corner at the other end of the block.  And that is when my antennae went up.  I walked the same way she went and pulled out my phone and dialed 911.  I saw her a good half block or more ahead of me, and there he was, pulling out of the alley to cut her off.  I could tell instantly she was now scared and she started to try to get past him.  I had my toddler in a pack so was weighed down but I had the 911 person on line and told her what was happening, as I was running toward him shouting at him to go away, that I had called the cops and other stuff that was pretty hysterical. And he took off fast.  I waited with her while the police came.  She was pretty shook up.  I made a statement and later was contacted.  They got the guy not far away, and arrested him.  Not surprisingly he had a record of sex crimes.  I was going to have to go to court but he pled guilty and was put away for a few years.  I did have a talk with the girl's mom and she thanked me profusely.  I was sort of sick in my heart over it all.  I came so close to ignoring what was happening."

It's painful enough to make you make noises you don't want to make.  It's painful enough to scare you while it's happening.  I'm not sure how to explain that properly, but I mean, while you are having a contraction you are scared it won't end, or you'll never get the baby out, or the next one will be worse, and all of that is the most terrifying thing you can imagine.

And then, when a few years later, I did it again.  Because that one afternoon, or day or weekend of torment was so very very worth it. "

Then he remembers about 5 days later while at work, but apparently didn't know what to do, so didn't do anything. I finally asked him about my birthday. He apologized, said he felt bad. But still hasn't done anything. I told him I'd be buying myself something on prime day and it would be a nice something. I also said I might get myself a gift for his birthday. This man used to be a good good giver. I didn't need anything expensive. Honestly him making a good meal and telling me happy birthday would have been great. "

"I'm quiet and reserved around most people. It often gets mistaken for shyness, which really isn't it at all, and a lot of people then feel that it's their personal mission in life to ""bring me out of my shell."" It's obnoxious.

I also have a flat affect, which is another thing that gets misinterpreted. Even when I'm trying to be nice, am genuinely interested in what a person is saying, etc., people often seem to think that I'm cold, disinterested, and what have you.

I think people also tend to take my not expressing things so much outwardly to mean that I'm unaffected by things, or not feeling anything, which couldn't be further from the truth. For example, if I'm dealing with something, I sometimes get comments from other people about how they'd be a mess in that situation, or would be feeling such and such, as if I'm not. I almost certainly *feel* like a mess, and am probably some combination of angry, stressed, sad, and disheartened; it just isn't apparent just by looking at me."
"My best friend all through middle school and most of high school. I remember the first time she told me she tried heroin and I got really upset at her. I remember rehab 1 and 2. I remember telling her I couldn't do this anymore.

"my SO is a twin and stuff like this happens all the time. it's fucking weird, like his brother was studying overseas and even so, they'd know the minute that they needed to call each other."

"His OK cupid pictures were super unflattering and made him look cute instead of gorgeous. I almost didn't recognize him at the bar we met at because of them. There was another dark haired man in a hat like he said he'd be wearing, and I was super bummed cause I thought it was him and other guy wasn't my type."

You're not the only one who misunderstood!
I'm not romantically attracted to women but I know I'd like the kind of sex I'd have with women (and anecdotally my bi friends confirm that). So I just don't open that door hahaha
I used to volunteer at an after school program at the Salvation Army and one of the little girls was named Shadow. I always thought that was weird and wondered what it would be like for her when she was older. 
"I was 20 when two forms of birth control failed (yeah I'm that unlucky!). I didn't find out I was pregnant until I was about 5 months gone so it was already too late to have an abortion.  I was devastated because i never wanted to have kids.

He's 16 now and I'm glad I have him but I'm also glad I never had any more kids. I won't deny that it's hard, I spent most of his life as a single parent, but it's been worth it as he's an amazing young man now and I'm really proud of him."
"i had reconstructive surgery (i think that's cosmetic surgery, too) on my nose and it was definitely worth it. i was born with deformed nose cartilage.  "
"It's more my boyfriend than me, but he doesn't want me to stick my finger in his butt because there is a chance he will like it, and then he'd want it all the time and that's not hot. I agree with him about that, and butt play is a hassle because it's gross, so I don't mind we'll probably never do this. I was just a little curious to see what would happen, the way I'm curious to try new combinations of food when I'm cooking."
"One night I went for a walk around my neighborhood with a friend. We walked until we were about halfway between our houses and then parted ways, about a 20 minute walk for each of us home.  I, 100% sober and fully awake, blacked out entirely and came to in my living room. My mother was standing there confused, staring at me standing still in the doorway. I called my friend immediately and asked her if the same thing happened to her. It did not. The only explanation I could come up with was that I either teleported or was briefly abducted by aliens. I have no idea what happened to me, but I do not recall the walk home and only had memory up until when we parted ways.  I didn't sleep all night, and it still bothers me when I think about it. 

This was 8 years ago and has never happened since. "
"Guy here, but a girl tried this on me. (maybe cringe)

Just at a dsco, I was sitting on a couch alone. Seems like the girl mustered all her courage to sit right next to me pretty close and I'm one dense idiot. So she nearly sits on me and I ingore her because I just can't wrap my head around what is giong on. Then she gets up and leaves looking realy defasted. This only adds to my confusion. Next day, while I was cooking, I just realized that she wanted to hit on me. It took me fucking 12 hours to realize she wanted to talk with me. 

Whoever you are, I'm sorry. "
"Agreed. Especially since we so rarely use the word 'male' to describe men. In the scientific world, ""female/male specimen"" or whatever is expected. But you don't say ""Go talk to that female/male over there"" in everyday life. "
"A mixture of his and mine. That's how the spanish system works. Everyone gets two last names at birth: the first one from dad, the second one from mum. When they reproduce, they give their first of the last names to the baby. Women never change their names. With each new family, a new last names combo is born. 

This is not a modern ""feminist"" thing. Women have never changed their names here. "
Boob sweat :(
"As long as men are the ones defining it, they can define it how it suits them! 😂"
"Same, I think I would love it. But I'm too jealous to do it with a partner-- so I would have to try it alone which I'm also scared to do lol "
The woman who did my driving test was named Cinnamon. Her twin sister's name was Ginger. 
I spanked my boyfriend the night I met him. Neither of us can remember why. 
"It was a blind date and at first sight he wasn't my type at all.

But (that same evening) he had tickets to an opera show I loved to see and, him saying it would be a waste to throw the tickets away, I agreed to go with him. 

When I arrived at the opera house it turned out his company had rented the evening out so it was all his co-workers. 

Him being the office geek they all assumed he had rented a prostitute for the occasion. The looks and gestures during the shows intermission were .. interesting - to say the least. "
"This is very similar to my birth. The cord was triple wrapped around my neck and every time my mom pushed, it strangled me and my heart rate dropped. The nurses said everything was fine and that it was a machine error, and my parents insisted something was wrong. They were right. Luckily I was so far down that the doctor was somehow able to reach in and unwrap the cord while pulling me out."
Also what if she becomes a Mom and then her kid is ... Destiny's Child...
"I got baby fever after never wanting kids. Got married, had kids. Things went south and he left which was for the better. I love my kids but I am resentful of the lies people told me:

* ""It will be different with your own."" Bullshit, unless you are a delusional, self-centered idiot who thinks their own baby's shit smells sweeter than everyone else's.

* ""The joy outweighs any negatives."" Uh, my kids are healthy physically, psychologically and intellectually ahead of the curve, and this is still a ""no"". I cannot imagine what it would be like having a severely disabled child, but I know the divorce rate of parents of SN kids is super high. The joy is long-term and it's muted.

* ""You'll learn what love is."" I don't know if I'm a fucking hateful asshole now or if I was a saint before, but I used to genuinely sacrifice for the needs of others. I spent a career working for other people's kids and the poor and I gave up a lot for that. I haven't become less selfish or more loving. I'm just focused on my own kids. If anything I'm more selfish because I'm only really able to take care of my OWN kids instead of make a career helping others.

If you don't want to have kids, if that isn't your calling, don't do it. I have never seen, as a bio mom, that adoptive moms love their kids any less so in that sense, you have the rest of your life to decide. No hurry to decide.

"I got botox on my forehead and at the corners of my eyes to take away the slight appearance of lines when I smiled or move my eyebrows. I got dermal filler underneath my eyes to fill in the bit of ""hollow"" and dark circle that was there from age (I'm 38). In my early 30's I had injections on the spider veins in my legs to make them disappear. This was all very worth it. The botox and filler isn't permanent, but I plan to go back and maintain it as needed."
"My mother was in a coma in hospital. My brother was sitting in a chair in the corner, where he'd been for 3 days. My mother suddenly awoke, sat up and pointed at my brother and said three words...""you're gonna die"", then slipped back into her coma.  
My brother literally slid down his chair and collapsed, he was tended to by hospital staff as he went into cardiac arrest, he spent a few days in hospital, undergoing a myriad of tests, and was released.  
Three months later, I went home and my brother was complaining of a terrible headache, which got worse. He was sitting up in bed when he said ""I'm going to die, mom is in the corner pointing at me again"".  
I called an ambulace, and he was rushed to hospital and died within a few hours. It turned out he had a malignant brain tumour.  
EDIT: This was dictated to me by my mother after reading her the title of the thread."
"I had double eyelid surgery. I had wanted it done since youth. (so about a decade) I flew across the globe to Korea to get it done and interviewed a lot of clinics. The moment I looked at myself in the mirror immediately after the surgery, I thought ""I wish I had done this a decade ago."" I'm so happy now, I hated being without makeup around people, or having people sleep over and see my eyes (one was completely different than the other) without eyelid glues and tapes on it. But now I'm comfortable in my own skin and I don't even wear makeup anymore. "
"Okay so nothing had put me off childbirth. *Until now*

"I was in a long distance relationship with Skype being our main platform to chat and video sex. Although the last time it happened was 5 years ago, the rare times I have Skype running every ""[someone] is now online"" notification sound turns me on a little."
"I think it should be *highly* encouraged. If they can find out early that the baby is only going to suffer until a very early death, the parents can prevent that suffering. If they know they don't want a special needs child, they can make plans for adoption or termination (which is what I would choose). "
I've found this to be avoidable by tucking the string up in my vag a little bit. 
"Very awkward... One date I went on, I greeted the guy with a big smile, and he had this extremely weird, angry look on his face like he was pissed off to be there. As I went to hug him, he backed off violently and said that he didn't like hugs. 

So I awkwardly smiled and tried to change topic of conversation. Then he starts laughing and says, ""Just kidding! Just wanted to see what you'd do!"" 

I never managed to shake the bad vibe I got from that moment. Couldn't wait to end the date. "
"Never actually tried it, but a friend of mine just looks boys in the eye in the club and says ""wanna fuck?""

"Do you ever feel like you have to ""live up to"" your name (E.g: Sunshine can't be depressed, Sunshine can't get angry)?"
"Ex best friend.

She was a habitual all-in type of girlfriend.  Immediately serious.  So she starts dating this dude, they get an apartment together.  She cheats on him with an old bf and decides she wants to leave him for old bf.  But wait! How can she do that and save face?! (SO and I had become close with her BF in this time)

So she decides her best course of action is to tell everyone he's abusive.  Only problem is, she's really bad at lying.  Like would ask me to meet her and show up saying BF held her down and cussed her out, she barely got away.  But he would be hanging out with my SO out at a remote lake fishing, had been with him all day.  No way that happened.  She'd call BF and lay into him.  He'd be with my SO, put the phone on speaker, let her go for awhile then hang up.  

She would then tell me *he* called *her* and went off.  It was a lot of stupid shit.  She'd lie about random stuff, like her and I went to a restaurant and it was my favorite place, when I had literally never eaten there before.

Anyway, the final straw came when she started telling people my SO was abusive.  


Dropped her like a hot potato.  We are still friends with him.  She is now married to that other dude (FB memories pop up and she has his last name)"
"Oh God... I usually don't talk about this, as it's not worth the judgement and having people assuming they know me based on my life choices. 

I've had boob lift/reduction and full body liposuction, in two surgeries on two consecutive days. The recovery was rough! Would I do it again? Absolutely. Would I do it *now*? Being older and wiser? Not so sure. 

I've always hated my appearance, after being groomed into it by my peers, society, family yada yada. So my whole live I've tried to change it, all the bits I disliked. When I started making money, I did. Loved it, still do. Is it perfect? No, the body will continue to age and change no matter what. 

But it allowed me to let go of my insecurities, start living my life after running out of fucks to give. I have no ""what ifs"", I did what I wanted and now I'm living with my choices. 

I also do regular face stuff, fillers and drizzle of Botox, simply because I really do like my appearance now and like to age gracefully. 

No ragrets. "

"Am male. Can confirm. Volatile emotions, lack of skill in managing them.

I think it's worth noting that there's even data to suggest that men tend toward being more clingy in relationships and take break-ups and divorces harder than women do.

Diana Fuss's book *The Reproduction of Motherhood* takes a good look at these sorts of things. I tend to agree. Despite our reputation, we penised folk are extremely emotional and fragile things. Probably has something to do with the repressed and toxic culture of masculinity."

"I had just began looking for a part time sitter for my 3 year old, who has a dozen food allergies. One woman came highly recommended, and after meeting with her multiple times and having my son interact with her, we decided to hire her. She swore up and down she could handle all his food allergies, and I provided ALL of his food, requesting that the few hours she has him, to not cook or eat his 3 anaphylactic allergies. WELL. I got a call at work from her one day saying my son Neville had hives everywhere, so I went to pick him up. His dad and I got there and the babysitter was LAUGHING saying, ""I was cooking eggs this morning and some spilled on the floor. Neville tried to pick them up and almost ate them!"" He is DEATHLY allergic to eggs, and this woman was laughing about him almost eating his own death sentence. From the secondary reaction alone, he had facial swelling and hives. Needless to say, we never contacted her again. "
"I think there are lots of bi women who feel this way--  sexually but not romantically attracted to other women. I sure do.

I almost got kidnapped as a baby and my mom saved my life. We were at the grocery store when I was maybe 2 and I was in the cart seat but I was very antsy and kept trying to get down. Eventually my squirming won and she put me down. When she turned around to get something from the fridge I wandered off. She noticed immediately and said she had a sense of doom worse than she'd ever felt. I was a wanderer but this time she said was different. She screamed bloody murder and told the grocery store worker her baby was gone and they locked the doors. They found me shoved into a shelf on the opposite end of the store. It happened so fast that there is no way I could have walked or ran there on my own. (This was a big store). I remember being shoved in the shelf and being put down from the cart but it's hard to tell if that's true or memories I've formed from being told the story over the years. Anyway without my mom freaking out and the grocery store responding so quickly (shoutout to Albertsons for saving my life too) I'm sure my life would have been much different. I love my mom

"His brother and SIL came to stay at our house for Christmas. I cleaned the house. I changed the sheets in the guest room. I planned meals. I coordinated in town relatives. I planned outings and a large family supper. I went to the dollar store and bought toys for his cousin's kids to play with during said supper so they wouldn't be bored and therefore infuriating. I bought food. I cooked. I cleaned. I did dishes. I shampooed the carpets. I planned EVERYTHING. 

And we had the most perfect family holiday known to man. I mean, the family Christmas I had always dreamed of having. Hot chocolate and gingerbread and carols and all that shit. It. Was. Perfect. 

Everyone noticed. My husband said something about how that was how Christmas went in the movies and it was so perfect and how come every Christmas wasn't like that. 

So I made a list of every single mundane task I did to make sure that was the best Christmas ever from making sugar plums to making sure there were extra toothbrushes in the guest bathroom. (Yes, I really made sugar plums.) His jaw dropped.  Like, he saw me doing it all, but he didn't SEE me doing it until I was like, this is why. And I told him that I was never doing it alone again. So, next major holiday rolls around, and he says he's gonna clean the house so I can focus on food. And after he thinks he's cleaned the whole house I gave him a list of things he didn't do that I would've. And he did those. And he's starting to get it. 

Thanksgiving time comes around and I ask him a week in advance if he's going to help. He's totally geared up and says he'll help me bright and early Thursday morning. And I'm like, no hun, prep for Thanksgiving starts well before then. I made him make a list of all the dishes we were going to cook, and then look up the recipes and make a list of all the ingredients we needed to buy. We cleaned the oven. We cleaned the house. We watched Romancing the Bird. We brined the bird. He made a cake. He called all the invitees to see what they were bringing. He did the work. And by the next Christmas he was testing out gingerbread recipes a couple weeks before guests arrived. 

He's always helped me with cooking dinner. But up until this point that meant he would ask me what we were having, get the things out of the fridge, and cook it. Planning Thanksgiving started the notion in his head that every meal probably had to be planned, and we talked about it. So I showed him how I planned every meal for the week, how I always had a backup plan in the freezer. And we started going through the same process weekly that we went through for Thanksgiving. Plan the meal, list what we need, shop. 

Now that he had the understanding of how much labor I had been doing without any help, he started looking for other places where I was doing a lot of behind the scenes work, and asking what he could do to help. And I can say with 100% certainty that if I am laid up, our household still runs. 

Also, we both work. I've never had a guy use that excuse, because I've always worked a full time job just like them. "

My response was so why does that matter? You said she's a nice person right? She said yes. I told her that's what you judge people on not the colour of their skin.

"That I'm actually really jealous and have had to stop myself from snooping through his messages when he leaves his FB open. I've never done it and I never will, but if I see another girl's name I'll feel that itch and it's safer to just log him out or go do something else.

I'm working on it but I don't like talking to him about it. It's the part of me I really don't like, that still ties a lot of my own self worth to my appearance. I know he loves me and will love me even when I'm old and wrinkly. But in my mom's attempt to keep me from having sex young, her constant refrain of ""You're young and pretty. Men will play all sorts of tricks and tell you whatever you want to hear in order to use your body, and then they'll throw you away when you stop being new and shiny."" has entrenched itself into my head as ""You only have value while you're young and pretty."" So everytime I see him interacting with someone prettier than me or smarter than me or god forbid both my mind begins to panic he'll realize I'm ""worth less"" (I know I'm not but stupid brain keeps doubting myself)

"i think that advice only holds for people who have unreasonable standards. if you're used to settling for less for real (ending up with deadbeats or abusers) i feel like the advice to settle for ''good enough'' is almost dangerous.

what i will say is that i found a healthy relationship by settling for ''boring'' when i was used to high drama, infatuation, and the beginning of the abuse cycle. got with my best friend. it's ''good enough'' in that it doesn't have that toxic excitement, but good point blank in all other respects.
