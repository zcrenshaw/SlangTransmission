"No, because I find those men don't keep it a secret. "
She types http://www. every time she goes to a website.
"Whenever we would argue (which was often, mostly because he was very controlling) he would try to tickle me or make me laugh when I was talking. I found it so disrespectful and just demeaning, if my current SO ever did that to me I would leave him on the spot."
"Selfishness. 

My ex was selfish both in bed and in day to day life. I was always going out of my way to accommodate him and got no consideration in return. 

 * I'd take time off work to look after him if he was sick, but if I got sick he'd send me home. 
 * I'd initiate sex, but as soon as he got off he was done, and I wasn't supposed to touch myself because that was ""gross"". 
 * I'd buy him nice gifts for anniversaries and holidays, and he'd do stuff like give me an IOU he never delivered on, or buy a video game ""for me"", and then trade it in once he beat it himself."
"There's a difference between asking me what my ethnicity is, and where I'm from *from*."

"He stores stuff in absurd places. It's not like he leaves stuff around, he has defined places for things that just make no sense.

For example, the place for empty water bottles is the bottom shelf in his fridge, the toilet paper goes in the bottom shelf in the kitchen, toothpaste and our brushes stay on the bathroom counter (while the cabinet behind the mirror is empty) and his winter coat goes in the trunk of his car."
Why are you so quiet?
"My ex officially dumped me on Xmas Eve. We'd been on and off for a few months, but he chose that day to announce I wasn't coming to Xmas dinner with his family and that he was bringing his new GF.

Well, like all previous years of our 4 year relationship. I'd done all the shopping for his multiple nieces, all their gifts were at my house. Given that it was 10pm on Xmas eve, there was no way he was going to have gifts for them by the 26th when his family was doing Xmas. I let him and his new gf show up empty handed for family Xmas and then I mailed all the gifts to his nieces with just my name on the card. He looked like a fool and had to explain to his new gf why he had no presents to give. "
"I get sucked into unsolved mystery or serial killer internet binges, and then spend the next few nights feeling not only creeped out, but utterly *depressed* at the amount of suffering that can befall one human being. "
"Right before my junior year of high school, my dad got a new job and moved the family about 1000 miles away. The boy I was seeing at the time and I decided we would try to make it work long distance, because we were in ""loooovveee."" While the house was being finalized my family moved into this tiny little condo where all the rooms were crammed right up next to each other, walls paper thin. 

Anyway, to try and keep the ""spice"" in our relationship, the boyfriend and I decided to try phone sex. At the time the only things I knew about sex I had learned from porn, so I thought the only way to turn him on and show that I was having a good time was to fake moan and say dirty shit LOUDLY. We hang up, I walk out of my room all chipper and there's my parents with disappointed/horrified looks on their faces holding my traumatized and crying little (10 year old) sister. She had heard the noises I was making, thought I was in some sort of horrific pain, and opened my bedroom door a crack only to see me doing unspeakable things to myself while on the phone. 

Not my finest moment. "
"""I was raised by abusive librarians."""
"I am an emotional shopper.  Bored?  Buy something. Sad?  Buy something.  Happy?  Buy something.  I'm very aware of the issue, but progress on actually fixing it has been slow.  I'm not exactly rolling in money so it creates issues."
"I adopted my bunny Buster. His little sign said that he was different from his other friends and he needed a special home. I was so sad looking at his lonely, unhappy little face that I adopted him immediately. 

He was covered in bruises and bite marks where his idiot ex-owner had allowed him to be attacked by other rabbits and he was petrified of all humans, so I can only assume that the owner was rough with him too. 

He was so terrified that he literally sat in his open cage for 6-8 months without taking a step outside to explore. If you tried to pet him, he'd cower and start shaking. It was heartbreaking. 

So eventually Buster moved with me into the house I share with my fianc√© and our dog Popcorn. After a lot of gentle feeding and very cautious petting, he's finally ok with us. He'll never be a cuddlebun like my sweet deceased bunny Renly, but he binkies all over the garden now, explores the house, puts his head down to be petted and has developed a strange and adorable friendship with the dog, who loves him. I'm just glad that I've been able to give him some happiness and love in his life. Poor little guy deserves it.

Let him watch half of the new season of OITNB on my Netflix account then changed the password. 
"I was actually the person he broke up with someone for, but it kinda answers your question. 

There was a very brief period of overlap (like a week at most) between me and his girlfriend (feelings, no sex) but he said he wouldn't break up with her for another three months, because she was on her year abroad in Japan and he wanted to do it in person. Then one day out of the blue he dumped her over Skype and asked me out that evening. 

Then 18 months later he did the exact same thing to me when I was on my year abroad in Russia. I kinda deserved it. 

Edit - by overlap I mean there were the feelings that come from dating without actually dating, if that makes sense. We didn't start dating until after he broke up with her."
"When people find out I'm married to another woman and ask ""So...who's....y'know....who's the guy...?"" complete with awkward hand gestures. I mean, it's one thing for someone totally ignorant to ask about aspects of gay relationships, its another entirely to ask which of us is more dominant in bed. Because that's exactly what it is and I haaate it. "
"I had an ex that was obsessed with money. I understand wanting to be frugal, especially as we were fresh out of school and still establishing ourselves. We had a budget and were able to pay bills while having a little fun. That part was fine. 

What wasn't was his complete unwillingness to do anything unless it was free to him. With one exception in four and a half years, we only went on trips his parents paid for. Almost never went out to dinner unless his company was covering the cost. And it seemed like every other month he was obsessed with a new get rich quick scheme. His goal was to make as much money as possible while doing as little as possible. His dream career was to retire at 30 from a 100k+/year job where he could just read reddit all day."

"If someone thinks their nethers are so gross that they won't kiss their partner after oral sex, they have no business asking someone else to put their mouth down there. "
I leaped out of a moving truck just to get a guy I thought was hot to pay attention to me.  He was not looking right then so I just ended up being dirty and slightly bruised and randomly showing up in his yard without a ride home.
"Anger issues. My ex got mad at really little things, and would overreact. For example, his phone wasn't doing what he wanted it to do, so he threw it across the room, in turn breaking something else. I'll never deal with that again. I constantly felt like I was walking on eggshells so I didn't set him off. "
Papa needs traction.
"I'd be really hesitant to enter a long distance relationship again. He's worth it, and I wouldn't trade that time for anything, but I don't think I'd do it again."
"I caaaaaaaaan't stand the stereotype that men are incapable adults, especially when it comes to parenting.  Ads selling cleaning or baby items are the worst for it &amp; it makes me irrationally angry."
"Clothes left where removed. Shoes about the kitchen. Hats on counters. Shirts draped over chairs or the sofa. Underwear in a pile beside the bed. I have an if its not in the hamper, I don't wash it rule and that's helped some, at least with jeans and work shirts. 

Like you mention in a comment, my SO also litters. The area we grew up this was super common. It was more rare to find someone that didn't, so it's been a habit for decades. Slowly making progress, but I still shoot more litter related death glares than I would prefer. "
"WOW that's bad. Tell her something needs to change. Seriously, it's:

He puts empty beer bottles back in the box in the fridge. I know he does this so that when the case is empty he can lift the whole case out to take to recycling but it's so much wasted space and our fridge is already packed. But whatever. Shoes I never ever wear take up the bulk of his closet space right now so I guess we're even. 
"I have found I don't enjoy parenting at all pretty much. And doing it alone, unplanned and with no support sucks. Having to pay a doula for support while going through birth and having a traumatic time all alone kinda broke a part of me that may never be fixed. But oh my gosh to I love my kid! He is nearly seven. The feels associated with my love for him are earth shattering. He is awesome! And it kicked my butt into gear to support us I started my own business which is a success so I don't ever need to work 9 to 5 again. We now travel about two -three months a year for fun and although he might eat toast too often, and not have a ""Mumsy"" mum  and go to school in unironed uniforms we've travelled 13 counties together, he helps in my business, we do what the hell we like when we like around his school terms and kinda have a blast and fall asleep spooning every night.  I am a better person thanks to parenting too, although the loneliness and difficulty in dating and having my own space mean it is no picnic. I don't think I would have been a parent knowing what I know now BUT I can't ever really wish that as then the amazing kiddo I have now wouldn't exist and the world is a better place with him in it. "
"Not really a bilingual thing, but I used to overhear a lot of people talking about me when I was mute.  My hearing was just fine, but everyone tended to assume I was deaf as well.

Probably the funniest thing was the women talking about how hilarious it was that ""the deaf girl"" is buying music CDs.  They had a whole conversation about it."
"I usually can't. There are sometimes certain little signs, though - like when a woman talks about how she used to date/is dating ""someone,"" my ears perk up. I know a lot of gay people, myself included, who will use vague language like that to avoid directly outing themselves. "
Just got out of my first long term relationship.  I will never date a bartender again.  My 9-6 workday and subsequent 11pm bedtime did NOT work with his 1pm-12am shifts and never having a weekend day free.
"I spend a lot of time giving advice on the financial subreddits and it is weird how often this seems to happen.  The couple will be in serious financial trouble, the woman wants to talk about it, the man responds by tickling her.  I thought it was super weird the first few times the woman would mention it but now I figure it's a relatively common avoidance strategy."
"A person that clams up and doesn't talk during adult conversations.  I'm in my 30's, I don't ever want to have kids, and I need to be clear on where the other person stands.

I cannot date someone who looks at me like a guilty puppy without saying a word when it comes to adult conversations."
"I put off important things I need to do until the last possible second due to anxiety.

"Overheard in IKEA (in French):

Guy:  You know, this chair would look good in our living room.  

Girl:  Oh.  Funny how you didn't think it was a great idea when I said it FIVE MINUTES AGO!!!!

I had to swallow my laughter.  It was funny because (1) all couple fights are the same - regardless of language, (2) IKEA engenders this exact type of skirmish.

I have also listened in on lots and lots of South Indian couples discussing whether or not I'm Indian.  Not only am I Indian, I CAN UNDERSTAND YOU, MOFOS!"
"TRP doesn't worry me. They're way too crazy to miss if they ever venture into the real world. General sexism and low key misogyny is all over reddit though, and I do think those views are more common than boys generally let on. I don't even think most people realize that they have sexist views."

"At the time, he and I lived together. While he was on a secret date with another girl (I found out after seeing a message he had sent a girl on an ok cupid profile - and no, we had not even talked about breaking up before that) I first packed up all of my stuff that I personally owned.

Then, I stole every battery in the house (he was a huge gamer and a lot of his controllers relied on batteries), stole the pillows off the bed and couch, hid all of the spoons on the top of the cabinets where he would never look, and I took all the toilet paper in the house. 

I left before he came home. I didn't come back that night."
"- doesn't throw things out when they're done. Like he'll leave empty pizza boxes in the fridge or leave empty shampoo bottles in the shower

- when he gets home from work he spends all evening on his computer instead of picking up around the apartment for 10 minutes and THEN going on the computer. this means messes get piled up and then he's ""too lazy"" on the weekends to deal with it once they become a gigantic to-do. If I don't come over for a few days, his apartment becomes disgusting because I guess I'm the only one who cleans.

- refuses to scoot the fuck over in bed so I have to sleep on the edge every night

- has his crap all over apartment on the floor and says no when I suggest getting shelving or storage bins because ""he doesn't want to move any more shit in here"" and I'm like... THIS WOULDN'T LOOK LIKE A FUCKING PIG STY IF THERE WERE SHELVES AND BOXES THAT THIS SHIT COULD GO INTO OBVIOUSLY. I actually started ignoring him and bringing over shelves and boxes and then putting his shit away for him and he's like ""wow this does look better."" NO DUH. It drives me fucking batty."
Completing yourself.  You have to do that from inside of yourself. Someone else can't do that for you.
I used to give my lunch money to a boy in middle school just to get his attention (and therefore skip the meal). I was such an idiot.

"This story is on my mother's behalf.

My father was a teacher and in his 20s worked as a lifeguard every summer on Hamblin Pond (bonus- he was not only a Hamblin, but a direct descendant of the original landowners). The lifeguard captain was also my dad's boss in the school system and knew him well. As an apology for moving him to a really slow section one summer he decided to partner him with a hot young blonde who was also a teacher. Two weeks after they met, they both broke up with the people they were dating and began dating each other. By September she had a ring and they were married the day after Christmas. 

That's the version known to my dad anyway. My mom had one significant loose end to tie up. Her boyfriend's mom made the *best* pecan pie and my mom hadn't gotten the recipe yet. So for the first two weeks of dating my father, my mother was still dating her old boyfriend to try to cajole that recipe out of him. She eventually got worried my dad would catch wind of this (Cape Cod in 1969 was a small community) so she decided to offer to put out as leverage. Yes, my mother traded sex and cheated on my dad for a pecan pie recipe. She broke up with her boyfriend the day after getting the recipe, became exclusive with my dad, and it lasted for another 47 years."
A lot people are saying you should leave him but I think that's crazy. You should definitely bury him alive.
"It wasn't something I did, as much as something I that I didn't do a thing about. 

The coolest guy at my charter school (20 students total), invited me to his house. We were hanging out talking in his bedroom, and after about 20 minutes his door swung open, and his brother, 22 years old (we were 15, and 17) stormed in with a video camera already recording. 


My classmate pretended to act surprised, and as he rushed the brother out I overheard the following conversation through the door: 


Classmate: Not yet!


Brother: This is the virgin, right?


Classmate: Yeah, but she's being prude.


Brother: You have 10 minutes!


Classmate: Easy.


He then came back into the bedroom and tried to kiss me, got really touchy, and was completely ignoring my questions as to what had just happened. 

The cringy part is even after all that, though I left the bedroom, I still hung out with the both of them for the rest of the day. Eww."
"A lot of people ask me how big my boobs are, since they are pretty big. It's invasive and awkward. "
"Fuck. Yes. 

Feminism is supposed to be a liberating philosophy, not an equally trapping one. Otherwise we'd all just move from 'You must act X way for the sake of men.' To 'You must act X way for the sake of women.' 

Keep on keepin' on. "
"I kicked his Sim out of our Sim Band, and my Sim started hooking up with Batman.  I had to teach Batman to play the bass, but it was worth it."
My general attitude as a kid is that being a boy was more cool than being a girl because of that sort of attitude.
"One of my first memories was my dad sitting there with my older brother and asking me, ""Why do girls suck at everything? Huh? Even the best cooks in the world are men!"" And he repeated it smugly, demanding an answer from me. I was 5 years old. My dad was my hero, so I thought if he said it, it must be true. 

It wasn't confusion, diffidence or resistance... I heard, loud and clear, that I was less than my brother. And that my dad valued me less, and that he would love me less the closer I was to being a girl.

Because his sexism continued, I dedicated my life to being as much like a boy as possible. The only thing I really wanted to keep was my long hair... Apart from that, I was all ""ew pink"", ""ew dresses"", and wanted to play all kinds of sports. Except he wouldn't *allow* me to do things reserved for boys (soccer, electric guitar, martial arts, etc.), so I was stuck in this limbo of trying to be loved by him but my attempts being rejected.  

He still says things like that to this day. My mom died when I was a teen so I'm the only female in my family. And whenever I tried to tell him how much it has affected me, he would say, ""God, why are women so emotional?"" 

That's another thing, I never felt like I could tell him what I was really feeling or he'd get a bad impression of women. That's why I became a severe alcoholic and drug addict, and why I have a really fucked up relationship with emotions. 

One little comment, at that age, can tear your whole world apart. "
"He will turn on a tv show for us to watch together and then disappear ~10 minutes in to do god know whats around his place. So I am left watching a show he chose, and if I change it he will ask why. Also, if we are both truly interested in a tv show and actively watching it together, he watches episodes without me so I'm way behind. Oh and if he does this he plays the season on like nothing happened and I'm lost with all the happenings in the show. And asking questions, can't do that either. -__-"

"Oh, god. Im young so the cringiest thing Ive done so far happened in highschool.

My long term boyfriend (2 yrs) at the time told me he suspected he was just dating me for the sex all along one day before school, then drove me to to school and dumped my ass by myself right in front of a huge crowd of classmates and drove off.

This was an asshole move because I- who, again, was told by my long term, first ever serious boyfriend-first love, that I had been used for sex the whole time, was obviously shattered and crying like crazy. This is the guy that I had my first pregnancy with. We had been through a lot.

Like, I couldnt even contain myself.

Im pretty sure I spent all of first period ugly crying. My teacher actually pulled me aside and asked me what was wrong and I told him. It didnt take long for everyone else in first period to learn what happened.

Because I made such a scene, word got around and the guy who dumped me started feeling bad about himself (he told me this).

So he asked me if I wanted to get back together with him.

The cringiest thing Ive ever done for someone was take them back so they would feel better about themselves because I ""loved"" them.

Yeah, when my classmates checked up on me the next day and I told them happily that we were back together they all collectively rolled their eyes.


"
"Well not just for HIM per se, but also a job. It sucks lmao I hate my life and want to move back."
"In high school, I got peer pressured into having Pokemon-themed phone sex with my crush. I had never had phone sex before and the whole idea made me really uncomfortable but I did it anyway because I really liked the guy and wanted him to like me back. 

It was bad. He said something along the lines of ""I'm as hard as a Metapod"", and I would say things like ""You make me wetter than a Squirtle.""

I found out a few days later that I was actually on speaker phone while he was hanging out with a group of his buddies that night. Word travels fast so I was the laughing stock of the whole school for a while. :( "
"My SO litters. It absolutely horrifies me and I always pick up his trash, but he just doesn't care. Not large items, but we were walking down the street last night and he stopped to buy a soda at McDonald's and the straw wrapper went right on the ground about 10 feet from a garbage can. "
I had a massive crush on this anarchist guy so I set a couch on fire in a parking lot to impress him. I almost got arrested. It was stupid as fuck but also funny.

"I read an American travel blog once that raged about how rude the service culture is in Sweden. For example they said that the service personell in shops don't care at all when you come into their shop, beyond perhaps a ""Hello!"" if they're feeling social. But honestly, whenever I've discussed this with friends we agree that is how we prefer it. When a cashier in a clothing store comes up to me to ask me if I need help or soething, that feels kind of uncomfortable to me, and it's almost like I feel pressured to buy from them because they talked to me. I can't just have a quick look around and then leave anymore. If I do need help I am capable of asking someone for it, but I don't want them offering it or really doing anything beyond acknowledging my existence, and even then only if they absolutely have to. 

And frankly, when they do ask if I need help I will most likely say no, even when I do need it because I'll feel like a bother otherwise... :/"

I'm super liberal but I see just as many liberals as conservatives passing off nonsense as facts and posting stupid memes covered in lies.  And then when I very politely post a reliable source that proves the lie is a lie, I get called nasty names, or sometimes they'll say ""Okay, thanks for providing a source!"" and then they're reposting the same shit the next day.  

I don't get it.  You have access to the greatest information source ever to exist and yet you can't be bothered to google whatever crap your posting and liking and upvoting."
"When I was 9 I really wanted a dog, so my mom took me to a pet fair and we bought what we thought was a Chihuahua puppy. It turns out she wasn't a puppy, but actually a very sick, very neglected ~~two year old~~ I talked to my mom now, and turns out she was actually 4! 

The vet told us she had all the symptoms of having been raised among larger dogs: she was extremely scared of everything, would shake all the time, bark at everything that moved, and wouldn't eat or drink from a bowl, besides her physical issues. She had a misshapen skull, an unhinged jaw that couldn't be fixed (so her tongue hung out the whole time), a limp, lost her teeth, hearing and sight prematurely, had asthma attacks, an extremely inflammed ovary, heart problems and later in life became epileptic.

The day we took her home, she was so underfed that she ate almost half her weight, and wouldn't stop wagging her tail and licking us. She lived a very happy life with us until she died at 16, full of love and all the comfort we could give her. :)

"Short answer: it's easy

Men are physically bigger than women, and women go through pregnancy/breastfeeding which makes them even more vulnerable.  Especially in societies without birth control this makes it easy for men to control women and keep them from positions of power.  Obviously if you can keep 50% of the population from competing with you for power/money/property/etc it makes sense to do so.  It's basically the same thing that majority populations do to minority populations (which is why women are often called a ""social minority"" despite not actually being a minority), when you have preexisting greater numbers and/or preexisting economic/social/etc power the easy and obvious thing to do is to make rules so that you can keep your status.

Excessive drinking or drug use is an absolute dealbreaker for me. The two exes I dated who were lax about drugs ended up being addicts and used drugs as a form of escapism. 
Steals and/or hogs the covers. On cold nights it's like a groggy 3am struggle to unwrap a human sized burrito.
"One time, as a joke, a coworker gave me four cases of peach Fresca, duct taped together.  As I was climbing the stairs to my third floor apartment, in 5-inch heels, lugging four cases of Fresca at once, I thought ""Holy shit.  I never could have done this a year ago.""  Then a quick google search for ""Fresca can weight"" afterwards, I realized ""Holy shit.  I DID do this a year ago, every time I climbed these stairs.""

But real talk, as someone who had been fat for her whole life, and only became smaller in her mid 20's, the sad scary part about losing weight is that I kind of discovered the conditional male privilege that is being an unattractive woman.  A lot of shitty people have these biases about women, that they've rationalized as ""Well, you're not like that.  I mean, like, you know the kind of woman I mean.""  Suddenly people talked down to me at work, attributed my technical skills to ""teamwork"" skills, and explained things to me instead of asking me questions or arguing with me.  People shouted at me from cars, and it sounded exactly like it sounded like when they shouted ""run fatass run"", but this time it was supposed to be a compliment.  When before I had this filter, where people only hung out with me if they thought I was interesting, so I only had to deal with cool people who liked me, I suddenly had all these shitty dudes who didn't think I had anything intellectual to offer, and didn't care if I did, because they just liked the way I looked and that's the extent of their expectations for women.

There's a hell of a lot of shit that doesn't happen to you anymore.  No one gives you the side eye when you eat ice cream in public, and no one grimaces when they get seated next to you in an amusement park, and when my thigh accidentally touches somebody else's on public transportation, I feel shame for a moment, before the lifesaving angry realization that *they* are the one spreading over that plastic seat boundary to air out their balls, and it's not just my big ol' thighs.

There's a whole new set of people treating you weird and different that kind of sounded like a theoretical ""OK, I get that that happens to you,"" that suddenly becomes more real.  And for me, having never experienced that before, it was real scary!"

"Speaking from experience, you lose understanding of what is ""normal."" Over time, the abuser constructs a new, abusive ""normal"" for you. 

It's like a frog-in-a-boiling-pot scenario. The relationship starts out like any other- fine and happy.

This happens in conjunction with undermining your sense of self so you doubt your own judgement and isolating you from any other people who would be able to intervene or be your wake up call, so to speak."
"I stole his favorite shirt. It was this shirt he'd wear literally all the time because he loved it so much. I cut it up and turned it into a crop top and then threw up on it when I was sick and threw it away.

I didn't reply. But I did bang five other guys wearing it."

"Drinking unfiltered tap water here is more local than national, I think. Everyone in Hot Springs, Arkansas drinks it out of the tap, for example. But there are other places where you'll actually get poisoned. And then there's taste - I'll drink unfiltered tap in Texas every season but summer, because that's when the lake algae blooms and everything tastes like old grass. "
"Honestly, there really isn't a clear way without them literally telling you. 

The fashion that used to be stereotypically lesbian is now much more common outside of the lesbian community, and more and more women are experimenting with the androgynous look. Even if they're wearing some sort of Pride accessory, it's impossible to know what part of the rainbow they are proud of. "
"I'm American, and I actually prefer the real answers over something pre-scripted. Although I've also been forcing myself to be more social for a few years, so that might make a difference."
"I was 4 and told my grandfather I wanted to be an astronaut when I grew up. He told me women could only be nurses or teachers. 

I became an engineer and got a job at NASA and married a (male) teacher. :)

But how did it make me feel? That my grandfather was a moron. "
"It might not be the cringiest but it is the one that pops to mind most readily.  My first year of college I was totally in love with my best friend.  Winter breaks happens and I am sure we will text all the time and talk frequently but when break actually occurs it's total radio silence on his end. He never answers my texts and I feel embarrassed and don't try to call him.  In an very pitiful attempt to get him to acknowledge my existence I went around my house taking pictures of the recent snowfall in the woods and posted the photos to facebook in the hopes he might comment since he is from Florida and snow was really exciting to him.  He liked two of the photos.  

The story is mostly cute now since we just got married last weekend but I still feel embarrassed about how happy those two pathetic facebook likes made me after some 5+ unanswered text messages.  It turns out he didn't know how text messaging works since he didn't start doing it until college and didn't realize it was okay to respond to somebody's text late so he kept on seeing my text messages ~30 minutes late and thinking ""damn I missed it.""

I told him after seeing this post what my true motives were in posting those snow photos and he laughed at me and said it was cute. I'm glad he thinks it's cute but I still cringe when I think about it."
"Traits from various exes that are now deal breakers for me (I think all of my past relationships have been learning opportunities): 

- inability to handle money/lack of basic personal finance skills 

- is consistently late or flakes on me or other people a lot 

- is angsty or, worse, ""suffers from *ennui*"" 

- doesn't have some kind of life plan, whether that's in the pursuit of hobbies or a career or a family or whatever -- I've learned I need to be on a path and I need to be with someone also on some kind of path; the uncertainty bothers me too much "
"To be fair, most of us aren't even organized enough to have a designated spot for our typewriters and Santa costumes. "
"That men are clueless, bumbling idiots who would be completely unable to function in public if not for his wife's guidance. Or any of the other tropes in commercials or sitcoms. 

Grocery shopping? Men do it too, and they come home with groceries instead of beer and bologna. Unless they're single and want to live on beer and bologna for several days. 

Kids? Fuck this with a rake. Dads are allowed to hang out with their kids. They don't deserve a medal or special recognition for being a parent. Babysitting is not parenting. Dads take just as active a role in a kid's life as its mother. The fear of a dad taking his kid to the park because people assume men are pedophiles makes me want to scream. 

"
"My last ex held in all emotions, wouldn't discuss his feelings about our relationship or me or anything really. He also hated himself had pretty serious depression that he dealt with by drinking a lot and working out an excessive amount. He also straight up ignored me for the last month of our relationship sooo that's definitely a no go.

Other ex was just a straight up asshole. Self absorbed, hated himself but also thought he was better than me because he was a virgin, thought he was better than everyone because he traveled and did a year abroad. Ugh I could go on but I won't because it'll make me mad.

No more assholes, basically."
"In high school, a girl I knew confided in me that her father kept her kitten locked in a hamster cage all day and allowed the three dogs to terrorize the poor thing. She was afraid that he would kill the cat one day when she wasn't there. 

She was right. I offered to take the cat to the shelter I volunteered at, and we skipped our afternoon classes so I could drive us to her house and get the cat. We arrived to see her father outside with the cat in the cage and a gun in his hand. He was *very* drunk. She shoved the cat in my car, and I peeled out of there before the situation could escalate.

The kitten was six months old- physically, being kept in a hamster cage damaged her spine. She's 8 years old now and winters are very hard for her. She and I spent a lot of quality time in vet offices talking about pain management options. In addition, her previous owners fed her dog food which lacks several vitamins that cats need for healthy vision. We're not sure just how bad her vision is, but I know that she has a hard time judging distances, and she can't see the bird feeder that is 10ft from the window.

Personality-wise, that cat hates everyone and everything on this planet...except for me. She has a serious case of hero worship for me. If I'm asleep, she literally guards the door against intruders. In February, she actually alerted me to a home invader before they shattered the window and came inside! 

She will cuddle me and beg for attention, but I have to tell everyone *not to touch the cat* because she bites with no warning and she will draw blood. For some reason, people always think that they are going to be the exception to that rule. I have a white board with a tally count of people that have lost that bet."
"""What have you been up to?""

The answer is absolutely nothing, but people want every fucking detail of my life sometimes. Just accept that I'm boring as fuck please "
My bf and I do the separate blankets thing during the winter and sometimes I wake up to him trying to steal *my* blanket in his sleep because his fell on the ground. I have to wake up to defend myself properly against his thievery! 
"Damn, this is definitely a deal breaker for me. In fact, I left a dude 4 hours into a date when we were headed back to my place because he littered and then refused to throw it away when I called him out. I left him stranded there. "
"We had numbers for our lunch accounts at my high school. So your parents would load $$$ on there, you'd punch your number into the PIN pad thing, and it would charge the account.

Giving out your number would be incredibly stupid so obviously I gave it to the guy I liked so he could get breakfast one morning. Because that's how you get the guy to like you, right?? Pay for his cheese danish and chocolate milk??

Almost a month later my dad asked me why I was eating a breakfast and two lunches every day. Wasn't sure which story would sound better.

EDIT: I forget the exact amount but he ended up stealing over $100 from my account and no he did not fall madly in love with me."
"My girlfriend will be telling a story or just talking, while looking down at her phone and then just stop talking in mid word, almost like a robot that was just switched off. Especially sucks when she's telling me a good story "

I skip the gym. every day.
"Now this one I couldn't deal with, do you say anything to him? Or just take it from his hand and put it in the bin 10 feet away?"
I'm so lonely. I had a victory in my life today. Something I worked hard on went really well and I'm kind of sitting here looking for appropriate threads to share it in because I have no one to tell. 
No.  He took mine.  I like my name and he hated his.
"We moved to the city from the suburbs- half an hour away from where he grew up and two hours away from where I grew up. He was already used to city life, but I grew up in the suburbs so I had some acclimating to do. The hardest part was finding a house that had a yard for my dogs who were also used to the large backyards of the suburb life. 

We made sure to preface our move with ""if shit hits the fan"" plans. We talked about what would happen if either of us lost our jobs (for how long the other could support the household, whether we'd need/could look for a roommate) or if we broke up (sleeping arrangements, timeline for moving out &amp; finding a roommate), etc. We also divvied up the chores. He LIKES to do housework and I LIKE to do outside/landscaping work. As long as the other can help out when asked, we'd be set. 

We had been dating four months before we made the move. Now after one year, everything is gravy. We found a tiny house with a medium-sized backyard, and it's perfect. Neighbors are people around our age and in a nice area. We got lucky. It's been difficult at times, but worth it. http://i.imgur.com/awnvrtU.jpg "
"Swearing in general conversation. In Australia, if I was telling a story about a massive fucking car accident or a dickhead at the shops, it was be all good. But in America, people looked at me like I was a fucking drop-kick. "
"Smoking. It just makes me sad how miserable he is from it and how much money he wastes. I used to smoke so I can't really judge him for it, but I do wish he'd stop for his own sake, because he really is in pain from it."
"&gt;Being a Trump supporter. Long story, but he became super conservative all of a sudden. I still love him and we have been together for years so I'm not going to break up with him because of his political beliefs.

Idk man I would."

"Gun control.

I don't understand America's obsession with guns. I believe that, if you want to buy a gun, various checks and rules should be in place."
"I laughed in his face when he cried. I know it sounds mean, but he was really an awful person. We were at a rave. The girl he dumped me for came out of the rave with 3 guys and headed off to a van. I don't know what they were doing in the van, but it must have been pretty bad.  My ex came out of the rave and asked me if I had seen his new gf. I pointed to the van, and he walked out there. He opened the door, some sort of screaming match ensued, and after about 5 minutes he came back all crying--tears rolling down his face. He looked like such a sad clown, but I thought it was funny and laughed in his face. "
"""Why are you so quiet?"" 

Probably because I don't know you yet so I'm listening to get a feel for what kind of person you are, you make me nervous, or we're around other people I don't know or other people who make me nervous. Possibly because I just don't like you. And if you *ask* me why I'm being quiet, especially if you do it multiple times like most people asking that question do, I will continue being quiet because I'm not going to like you after that. "
"Having a really expensive hobby. It was insane how much money he would spend relative to how little he made...I guess you can add having a rich enabling dad as well. At least twice a month it would go like this:  
Me: ""Hey, wanna go out to eat?""  
Him: ""Can't, I'm broke this week.""

"I liked this boy who I worked with, but I was too scared to talk to him. So in the hopes of him coming up to talk to me, I stared at him invitingly because that's what you're told in all dating books, right? I stared at him all the time and now I can tell that he felt so uncomfortable. I feel so bad and wish i could go to him and apologize but that would be even creepier."
I gotta admit Mr&amp;Mrs X does sound impressive 
"I feel like JBiebs's ""Sorry"" sounds like an abuser wrote it. Starts out by blaming her for being upset when he insults her, saying he's just being honest, admits he's refused to change in the past but says this time will be different, adds a totally unnecessary disclaimer that he's not just saying sorry to get back in her pants, follows up by saying you know you were equally at fault here so don't put all the blame on me, threatens to ""spill the truth"" about her to outsiders, and finally demands why they can't just ""say the words"" and forget about it, as if apologies are about following a meaningless script rather than expressing your actual dismay at having hurt someone. "
"My mom's cousin, for whatever reason, does not think that my brother and I understand Vietnamese or French.  Granted, we were both high-school level French when we stayed in France with her for the summer, but our primary mode of communication was Vietnamese so she must have known that talking to her sister about how ugly my brother was (because of his hippy hair) with me in the same room, I would understand it.  Her sister told her, ""You know they understand you, right?"" and she was all, ""Of course they don't. Silly American children"" and went on talking shit about us.

... I guess it's not really funny, but the apologetic looks her sister kept sending me were hilarious. This aunt was mean and crochety to everybody, though, and was totally the worst of both French and Vietnamese elitism. "
"Seating different parties at the same table in restaurants.

"Leaving his post shave abominations in the sink....we have two bathrooms and he usually uses the one downstairs. Every time I go to the sink, hair everywhere! It's like he always has a fight with his beard and the razor......"
"My mom is a veteran and her thoughts on the matter are as follows:

Take a look at everyone else in the crowd during the anthem. There are people talking, laughing, drinking beer, eating their hotdogs, getting up to go to the bathroom before the game starts, sitting with their hats still on. 
There are plenty of people in the crown not ""respecting"" the flag or the anthem so why is this guy getting attacked for it? At least he's standing up (or sitting down) for a cause he believes in. Whether you believe in his cause or not, he has a right to do it. 


She always says she didn't join the military to fight for only the rights that she believed in. She fought for everyone's right to freedom. And this is how he chooses to use his. "
"I have depression and my whole life sometimes feels like a big poor decision. I don't attend my college classes, I don't leave the house, I don't meet new people, I cancel every plan I make, I don't meet my friends..."
"Not wanting to be ""partners"". I'm sure some people are better having a lot of independence in their relationships (i.e. keeping lives/jobs/ambitions separate and their relationship be strictly companionship) and keeping their ""stuff to themselves"" but it's just not for me. I like feeling involved, I like the idea of being with someone who would want to work with me, involved me in their life in various ways. Even if it's just in theory ""hey, we could run a B&amp;B together one day!"" type stuff, it makes me feel loved, appreciated, and useful. 

My EX never wanted me to be a part of his passions. He loved skateboarding and he was a (self-proclaimed) artist. As these activities reflect, he very obviously loved doing things solo. He never wanted me to come watch him, or learn or participate in any way. He liked keeping his passions to himself and didn't want to share me with those parts of his ""world"". I'm not saying that's wrong, I understand that he wanted them to be special to him.....but for me, it just didn't cut it.

My SO now **wants** me to be of his goals, passions, projects etc. Even if we never actually do, it's nice to know and hear that we have dreams that we're planning to do *together*. 
"
Sometimes my boyfriend stops me mid bj to kiss me. It's whatever.
"I'm a black woman that likes to get my hair done at Dominican salons, where the stylists often speak Spanish to each other. Once, when I was getting my hair straightened, two stylists debated in Spanish about whether or not I'm prettier than the daughter of the woman actually doing my hair. I was flattered, and also thought it was fucking hilarious because this woman was actually conceding that I have a prettier face than her daughter. "
"I'm currently doing a required internship as a part of my college program. 

I'm getting my degree in childcare/teaching degree focusing on 0-5 year olds. During the internship I have to apply theories and literature to my work and document it. 

Today my professor came for a meeting about my progress with me and my supervisor. I had spent a long time preparing and making sure I was ready. It went very well. "
"My dad and brother never shut up about how much stronger men are than women. And this seems to be a thing a lot of men never shut up about, which is really pathetic. Congratulations, you're stronger than someone who has far less muscle mass than you! No shit... It would be shocking if you weren't. 

As an adult woman I am stronger than a child. What an accomplishment! I'm so cool! I'm going to brag about this every time I watch a little league game. 

That's what all those guys sound like.  "
"When there's something that's ""low key"" enough that I'd feel uncomfortable complaining about it, I try really hard to make a joke pointing it out.  And this counts for either uncomfortable sexual whatever or just general assholitude.

Lay the turd on the table.

If somebody hugs you and you don't want them to, go ""Ah!  You're really touchy aren't you?""  If they start talking about my butt, I could be like ""hahaha are you talking about my butt?  Is it office butt talk time?  hahaha that's so weird.""  If somebody makes a mean backhanded compliment, be like ""haha Wait, did you call me clumsy?  What a weird thing to say! haha""

The key is to point out the behavior and declare that it is not normal, but be so so pleasant about it that no one could ever criticize you for saying that.  Like, what are they going to say ""She's so mean, she said don't touch me.""  You've put them in a position where they need to either defend their behavior or apologize.  And in either case, just be pleasant as punch about it.  ""Oh that's ok!  Just seemed weird, that's all!""

And now, you have officially and loudly been on the office record for telling the person to not do that, and if they keep doing that, you can make a thing and escalate it."
You want recipe? You know the price. 
"I always kind of suspected he was a lot more attracted to *men* than he was willing to admit, but last I heard he married a woman and they had a daughter, so who knows? He had a lot of aversion to vaginas."
"I had a huge crush on my 10th grade English teacher, who was hot, ripped, and a bomb disposal expert for the Army in his spare time. We will call him Mr. Y, as in, ""y did I do this.""

Mr. Y took a totally professional interest in my writing abilities. I adored him, even though he had a fianc√©e.

During my last week of senior year, *two years* after I last had Mr. Y as a teacher, I gave him a *handmade card drawn with colored pencils* to thank him for ... I don't know? Being great?

Seriously, what the fuck self."
Being strung along. I'm 56. I don't have time to play games!
"I always need to remind myself that's not a true question! In my old company we had American clients, they would ask how I was and when I went ""I have a little cold and couldn't sleep well last night, but still a good day...."" they would look at me confused."
"I still will get a pang here and there. It's been....3 years since my last run at in vitro (we did a total of 3). It does not rule my life though. We only get one! This is it! I refuse to pine over ONE thing I didn't get in my life and choose to celebrate all the things I do have. I could have continued trying. Exploring other avenues. But it was literally sucking my life out of me trying to create another one.

The worst part was the following 3 years of ""what ifs"". Any time my cycle was late, I'd have that ""oh gah, what if? No no no...surely not. It's been 15 years, it's not going to happen. Stop thinking about it."" Inevitably, my cycle would show and I'd have to go through that whole process again and again. 
 
So, for my 36th birthday, I had what I call an ""Anxietyectomy"". 3 weeks ago, I had both tubes removed. If I can't take charge of my infertility, I damn sure will take charge of my mental health. I woke up from surgery and felt....relief. I'm finally embracing being not just OK, but happy. Uncertainty begone. "
"Few parents admit that you can dislike parenting, but still love your kid."
He probably thought it was touching that he made such an impact on a student from two years ago. 
"If he has a bomb ass name, I will. If it's something like Pitts or Hyman, NOPE. "
"My dad has this recipe for my grandfather's bread (Guido Bread) and it's fuckin delicious. He promised to tell me how to make it but only on the condition that my mom never got any. He said 'When she left me, she left Guido Bread.' I made some for a party and made sure it all was eaten by the time mom got home, and he was happy he bought me a dedicated pan to make Guido Bread in."
"Children nudity, free range children, not being afraid when a stranger talks to children. 
Topless in beaches, nobody crates their dogs, you can drink at 18 and most kids drink before, we eat everything from the pigs, even the lungs, ears, and brains.

"My mom's second husband would do this to my mom a lot. He was a cop and a major control freak. When I was about 15 we were innocently rough housing (I thought) and suddenly he tried to rape me. Up until that point I didn't realize that he found violence sexually stimulating. 
"
"My parents adopted a 10+ year old Pekingese that had been in a puppy mill. The animal shelter found her dumped on the side of the road, and it appeared she had had tons of litters of puppies. They think she became too old to have puppies anymore and was abandoned. We think the spent most of her life in a cage - her back legs were very weak from not using them much, and she had some bladder control issues from all the litters. 

She was the sweetest dog I've ever met. Incredibly happy and friendly - even just going out in the yard seemed like a new wonderful experience for her. She basked in attention. If my dad gave my mom a kiss when he got home from work without giving the dog a pat, she would get in-between them and bark until he crouched down and said hello to her too. She was fascinated by the TV - she would watch it for hours, and if there were puppies on Animal Planet, she would get up on her (very weak) hind legs and whine to try and get close to them. 

She ended up wearing a diaper for a year because her of her bladder issues. She started having seizures, and after trying some different medications to treat it and failing, my parents had to put her down. They had her just over a year, and she was the sweetest most affectionate dog they ever had."
"I want kisses before, during, and after all parts of sex, so if someone is not willing to kiss me, we're probably not going to work out."

"* **Men should be/are overtly masculine.**
* **Only attractive, dominant men get sex partners or relationships**

I just don't really understand why some men *believe* these.

We get men who come to this sub and are sad or angry because they perceive themselves as failing to achieve one or both of these supposed requirements.

And I mean I get it on some level because obviously the media and society feed us ideas of what we should be.

BUT I just don't get how some men buy into these so wholeheartedly despite the fact that **observation of the world around you should tell you these are not necessarily true.**

Guys be all *""Oh I'm going to be alone forever because 80/20 rule, not handsome, only alpha men blah blah blah"".*

And I can't help but think - *Jesus Christ have you literally ever gone outside ever in your entire life? HOW DO YOU NOT SEE HORDES OF PEOPLE LIVING LIFE FIRMLY AVERAGE?* Not manly. Not super buff or strong or hairy. Just like, regular dudes. Regular dudes with girlfriends/boyfriends. Regular dudes who have sex and relationships.

**Men aren't catty.**

There's this idea that men never ever backstab, and they're never two faced to their friends, and they're never mean or catty or manipulative or passive-aggressive in social situations.

Oh my god, so many of my male friends love to complain about one another. Srsly, you guys don't recognize the behaviour in yourselves but it damn sure happens!

____

**Men act from a place of emotionless logic.**

This one sucks because firstly it makes men feel like they're not *allowed* to have emotions or make choices emotionally which limits them.

And then secondly it sucks because there's this idea that a ""logical emotionless"" standpoint is inherently better, and thirdly, that that's even where men are operating from in the first place. You might be feeling *different* emotions, and your capacity to recognise your own emotions might be different, but that doesn't mean you're some super logic robot.

____

**Men are not nurturing**

I hate this one so much because it makes some men:

* Afraid of being around children
* Afraid of *helping* children
* Believe they should be a ""secondary"" parent (ie less active in child-rearing)"
free range children really do taste so much better
I avoid things because they make me feel sick with anxiety and use the Internet to deal with feelings.
"I feel you on this one. Where I used to live, the dating scene was full of bartenders and musicians and such. I was working 9-5 and had a policy of dumping anyone the moment they decided to send me a ""Are you up? Want to come out for a drink?"" text after 10 PM on a weekday.

No. I'm getting up at 7. I want to go to bed."
"Americans are mostly not saying sorry because they walk in front of you, they're saying sorry because your cart is in the middle of the aile. As an American living abroad for a very long time- this still drives me nuts. I say 'sorry' when I know I need to pass you and there is minimal room on either side. It's the polite American way of saying 'move your fucking cart'. 


"
I had given my shoes to be repaired at a store that was run by people who speak my mother tongue. I however conversed with them in English. They told me my shoes would be ready in a couple of days. When I returned the man said it was out at the cobblers and he would get it back two days later. As he spoke he handed a plastic bag to another salesman and told him in my mother tongue that the shoes were in the bag and to get them fixed because he had forgotten all about them. His horrified face when I spoke to him in my mother tongue telling him I knew the language was priceless. Definitely worth the additional two day wait.
"I was on a train in Japan and a few businessmen kept talking about how dark and scary my friend was (she's black), she turned around and told them in perfect Japanese that she was shocked at their behavior and she thought Japanese people had more manners than that.

They start bowing and apologizing a lot and got off at the next station, it was funny, they were literally walking backwards out of the train carriage, still bowing. "

"There is a great quote about this from John Lennon.

*They made us believe that each one of us is the half of an orange, and that life only makes sense when u find that other half.*

*They did not tell us that we were born as whole, and that no-one in our lives deserve to carry on his back such responsibility of completing what is missing on us: we grow through life by ourselves. If we have a good company it‚Äôs just more pleasant.*

My first love wrote this to me in a letter after we broke up and it kind of stuck with me. "

Edit: I was single for about a year after my divorce, and ended up marrying the guy 2 years after that. "

"I actually got this once, by my summer school teacher, who happened to be a very liberal activist type, which surprised me. I expected better from her. She singled me out and demanded to know where I "" was from"". I knew damn well what she was asking but being miffed about having the spotlight put on me in front of thirty kids it basically went like this. 

Her: That-lol-chick where are you from?

Me: Uhhh, here? (As in im american)

Her: Oh. But where are your parents from? 

Me:Also here.

Her, getting flustered after everyone is laughing: Your grandparents?

Me, just about damn done: Here.
 
Finally she asks me outright what ethnicity i am. I still dont know what her point was. Either way, save for a couple of delicious cultural plates and watered down traditions, im about as American as you can get."

"This is one of my moms fave stories to tell (so I recount it bc it is a great story). My mom was in Germany in the seventies, and she is American born but of German heritage, so she looks v German, blonde blue eyes etc. 


On the subway in Berlin, a bunch of American soldiers who were stationed there started discussing her boobs and body and stuff assuming she was a local girl and couldn't understand. 


She waited till her stop and then told them to they were idiots in English as she got off. The look on their faces was apparently great."
"I married a guy in the military, and so I not only moved to his first station but then moved with him every couple of years after that for a couple of decades.  

It very much became ""you and me against the world"".  It became harder and harder to keep in close touch with long-term friends as time went on and we didn't see each other.  We'd move to a new place and he'd have an instant social network due to work, and I'd generally struggle.  

It also really hurt my career plans.  I'd get a job when I could, but a lot of times, I'd feel like I could network my way into a far better job just about the time we were moving somewhere else.  So it was a succession of entry-level jobs, mostly.  I had been ambitious -- that trained it out of me, as my ambition seemed just pointless and frustrating.  

We had 10 great years.  We divorced in year 19.  I know wish that I hadn't given up so much that I had wanted to do or be for the relationship, but it was kind of required for that relationship to work.  Ah, well."
"The flaking and cancelling made me sad red for a second. I saw a guy for a while who would say 'let's hang out Friday afternoon. At 5 I'd ask where he was. He'd say in an hour or so, be there soon, I got caught up with something, be there soon, got caught up into something else. Eventually I'd go to bed at 11:30 by myself when I set aside the afternoon (like 3 on) to hang out with him. 

If that happens even once with someone else I'll flip."
"I work at a job where I see a couple of clients a day and there is always small talk involved.  I don't mind most of it, but I hate getting the ""do you have/want kids"" questions.  They usually first ask if I'm married and when they find out I am, that is the next question to come.  It's just that I do want kids, but after being married now for 4 years and pretty much trying the whole time...it's a touchy subject.  I have to remind myself they are just being polite and today is not the day to snap back and tell them about how I don't think I can get pregnant.  "

"I am 40 down from my heaviest right now. I have about 15 to go. Biggest thing for me was BALANCE. You do not have to go to the gym EVERY DAY and eat oatmeal and salads EVERY DAY. It will only lead to failure. I wish I would've known this the first 10 times I tried to lose weight. If I was right on track 5 days out of the week, that was success for me. I learned I can have those pizza and beer nights out with my boyfriend or go out to drinks with my friends, but just eat one slice of pizza instead of 3, or drink diet gin and tonics (with lime, duh) instead of long islands. Yes, it will take longer but it's so worth my sanity. Patience is key. Also, finding an exercise you like is very important and I didn't even know such a thing was possible!"
Nope. Because I don't want to. I like my name. It's mine.

"My ex had *literally* (not figuratively and not oh here's a number I'm making up) about $10,000 worth of bicycles. He had one that was a $5,000 bike. 

Sometimes we didn't have money to pay our rent on time and he would have to pawn his guitar. 

He handled all of our finances and would treat me like I was being crazy if I wanted to grab a $5 lunch once in a while. 


I eventually divorced him for many reasons, but the crazy thing was that I realized we weren't broke. Please don't think me an idiot. He was very manipulative. He also worked at a bicycle shop. So he would tell me that these things were on loan or being paid for in small payments etc. 


For five years I wanted a new computer and he kept saying no. We can't afford it. 


Within two months of living on my own I was able to buy myself a new computer and tablet. I realized he had been spending all of my money. Our paychecks went into the same account and he handled all the finances. 

Also, weeks after I moved out he called me asking if I could please pay for his prescriptions because he was broke. I did because I knew he really needed them, he had really bad asthma. It was sort of a power play on my part though because it made me the bigger person and I could tell he didn't want to ask me. "
"We're doing well but sometimes I think I can't have a serious talk about my feelings because he doesn't really get how to deal with it. I'm pretty lonely because of it, I don't have anyone else to talk to when I've had a bad day."
"""Do you have kids?""

Or, ""How many/is he your only child?""

I have two children, but only one living. Our first died in a car crash. I usually have to decide whether to just say I have one child or one *living* child, which starts the stream of sympathy where I end up reassuring them because they feel really bad... It's just awkward. But I also don't like pretending my son didn't exist or isn't my child anymore, so it just depends on who I'm talking to. I think about my son every day, but it's just another reminder I should have a silly little 4 year old hopping around asking me about life. Fuck you, death."
My guy has sex with his socks on. It's so weird to me to be wearing nothing but your socks.

"My dog is a Craigslist find.  Totally malnourished, and he had such bad fleas that he had  wounds and hairless patches all over from scratching. He was so underweight that the vet wouldn't give him his vaccines yet. It took 3 months for me to get him to the minimum weight.

He was surprisingly docile,  which leads me to believe he wasn't technically ""abused,"" just that his previous owner was unable to afford him.  She was a pregnant teen that  lived on her own in the low income part of town and already had a baby, 2 dogs,  and like 4 cats. 

This was my first dog ever,  and I really couldn't have asked for a smarter,  sweeter dog.

I've had the reverse happen too. Once had a delivery driver come in the kitchen and go way out of his way, past several other people, to ask me where the chef was, because he obviously assumed I was the only one who would speak English."

I do like the idea of standing for the national anthem. (Although we don't do the hand on heart thing here.) I like that the action represents respect for the country.

I don't know, I'm paying the bills and then some, and I'm pretty happy where I'm at now.

* ""Wow girl, your butt's huge, what do you to get that figure?""

Sit on it. I don't know, it's just big.

* ""Do you have a boyfriend?""

No, I'm actually gay.

* ""Oh, why?""

Because penises are weird mushroom tentacle monsters and guys smell like onions."
"I got this ALL THE TIME when I worked in a cafe on the till and as a barista. 

I would constantly have customers ask me, ""Where are you from?"" And I'd say ""Here"" (Australia).

Some would even say, ""No you're not."" Like ok, you got me. Totally don't know where I'm from or anything. 

I'm also always being asked if I'm Greek or Italian. When I first started dating my current boyfriend (who also assumed I was either Italian or Greek), I had to go through the whole ""Are you Italian?"" ""No."" ""Greek?"" ""No."" conversation with every single one of his friends. 

No matter how many times I say ""I'm 5th generation Australian"", NO ONE will be satisfied until I say, ""One of my ancestors 1000000 years ago set foot in France"" or something that somehow 'explains' my dark colouring. "

"Long story short, my bf moved from the Midwest to New England to live with me. We had previously lived on the west coast together even though I'm from NE. He's having trouble finding a job.

"This is so true and funny. I bought a fancy dress at an auction and love it. I often look at it, try it on and think, when will I ever wear this? It's like a grad dress.

So yesterday, my sister calls me an invites me over for a glass of wine and I said yes...and decided to wear the dress.
I showed up in it and she was so shocked. I told her ""I have no idea when I will ever wear this so tonight's the night!"" She laughed and then said ""should I go out a dress on too?"" I said yes!

"My dog was neglected and mistreated by his previous owner (no physical abuse as far as we can tell, just a bad/lazy/incompetent owner), we got him when he was about a year and a half. He was a skinny little thing, with serious fur problems and open sores from fighting with his brother (not big ones, just obvious bite marks). He also had serious problems with food, lunging at his bowl as soon as we had it in our hands and eating as fast as he could. And of course trying to get all the hooman food too. We think that's what the bites were from; fighting his brother for food (and losing :( ) Of course he had not been trained at all, apart from being house broken.

So we took him in. He's our first dog so while he had to learn to be a house dog, we had to learn to be dog owners. It's been a year and he still has some problems, especially with food. But since food is his motivation, we've used that in his training and he's learned to be somewhat a 'good boy'. He's more stubborn than anyone and will never be a cuddly couch dog, we've accepted that. He'll get to be himself, even though it means he'll look spoiled and misbehaving to our guests. We know the progress he's made (and we'll keep working with him) and he's our little guy.

"""Fixing"" your partner. People change naturally and that's okay, and it's even okay for them to be motivated or inspired to change by someone, but its *not* okay to get into a relationship with the intention or expectation of changing that person. Far too often you see people dating assholes and saying, ""They could change!"" Or, ""If they love me, they'll stop [insert action/trait here]!"" Everyone has flaws, and part of dating is finding someone who has flaws that you can live with. They might change, they might mature, they might have an epiphany and realize they were a jerk... but they might not, and there's no guarantees. Its not up to you to make it happen. Your crush is a smoker and you hate smoking? Don't expect him to quit for you. Your crush is a player and a ""bad boy""? Don't delude yourself into thinking that he'll be different just for you. These things CAN happen, but they also have a good chance of NOT happening.

A related one is getting into a relationship to fix *yourself*. A relationship will not cure your problems. Don't expect it to."

"I am grateful for how my dad raised me and my sister.  It was really important to him that we could do anything that boys could do (and that he only had daughters so he had to use us all the time to lift heavy stuff around the house).  

We didn't hear the gender disparity comments until we entered school where little boys would say that girls can't do math or girls can't do science or girls can't run, etc etc.  It really made my dad angry when we told him about those comments.  He challenged us to prove them wrong, and I have used that attitude throughout life.  If he had not challenged us to prove them wrong, I am not sure what my reaction would have been.

I am nearly 30, my dad has passed, and I still use this attitude.  We were visiting my aunt and uncle and we were rearranging their porch furniture so we could chat.  My uncle was insisting up and down to let my [male] cousin lift the chairs because they were really heavy - let a man do it.  I looked him straight in the eye, lifted the heavy chair, moved it, and went onto the next one.  CHALLENGE ACCEPTED SIR."

"Decapitated a childhood toy of his which I had custody of, and threw it in the garbage.

When we were dating I'd given him my baby blanket and he'd given me a stuffed dog from his childhood. He was abusive, and when we broke up I told him I would meet with him to exchange our belongings, but only if we met in a public place.

He refused to meet in public. He wanted to come to my place, or to my parents' home, and I refused to do either. After a couple weeks of trying to negotiate, I had to move apartments and didn't want to take the crappy reminders with me, so I trashed everything he ever gave me - including his stuffed dog.

I did get my baby blanket back, but only because his roommate saw him about to throw it in the trash a year later and emailed me. Unlike my ex, he was willing to meet me in a public place just in case, and I got my stuff. Roommate was a true bro."

"I foster difficult dogs, mostly chihuahuas. These are dogs that were abused and neglected and have close to no social skills. 

I had one dog named Axel who lived his entire live in a plastic carrier in the house of a hoarder. His ears actually had holes in them from what we suspected to be fly bites and his back was hunched from never being able to stand up and move. He bit me the second I got him off the transport. He would hide in corners and shake, I'd just talk to him and try to get him to come to me but I wouldn't go touch him because.. He bites. One day I was taking a nap on the sofa and was woken up by him slowly creeping on to my chest and he licked my face. It was really the best thing ever.

"It hurt a lot, as a kid.  I was so confused by it too, because it clearly made no sense.

For the longest time, I just assumed that it was all, like, a figure of speech, like ""You throw like a girl.""  Like, as a kid, I did gymnastics.  I played with boys.  I loved moving heavy boxes of Christmas ornaments with my dad every December.  I just internalized it as this idea like ""so there are girls who are 'girly' like princesses, and saying 'you throw like a girl' is like saying 'you throw like a princess who has never touched a baseball', and it's weird but i'm not going to make a big deal about it because clearly they don't mean me.""

I remember the moment when I realized that it wasn't just a figure of speech.  In like 6th grade, a teacher said that she needed some ""big strong boys"" to help her carry something in from her car.  And I assumed she just wanted big strong people to move things from her car, because I was obviously just as strong as the boys in my class, so I raised my hand.  But she called on one boy who raised his hand, said ""T-Flex, put your hand down"" then waited there for another boy to raise his hand, before she picked him.  Everyone laughed at me.  For weeks, for thinking I was a boy.  Then, every time I heard ""you throw like a girl"" or ""I need some big strong men to-"" I realized that everybody actually thought that I was or should be weaker than boys, and that confused me a lot.  Because I wasn't.  And then I realized that the boys would get stronger and stronger, and I would stay the same, because I was not allowed to pick up heavy things.  If I tried in gym class, someone would tell me I was going to hurt myself and to go use the elliptical.

It killed any idea that I had as a kid about ""I could be a hero/ninja/pirate/main character in a movie"" because I just spent so much time thinking ""They mean boys or girls, they're just using a generic boy as a visual shorthand"" and then I realized that they actually meant ""no only boys get to do this"" and it just ruined my whole internal fantasy life.  It ruined Ninja Turtles and The Sword in the Stone, and I started reading Sailor Moon.

To this day, I am hypersensitive of people telling me I am not strong enough to do stuff.  I have spent a decade in the weight room, wondering when I will be strong enough, or look buff enough, that strangers will look at me on the street and think ""sure, you're allowed to do that.""  And it's never going to happen and that makes me mad.  I'm stronger than most men, and it hasn't happened by now.  It's never going to happen."

"I had not thought about this in years.

It feels like a story from long long ago, in a universe far far away...

Yeah, I was 19,  I broke up with a guy I had been dating for about a year. I had started dating another guy. We were about the same age, he was my boss. My mom was dying of cancer that summer,everything was weird. The new guy seemed more stable, our backgrounds were more similar. It's hard to explain. 

Anyway, at the end of that summer, late in autumn, we got married. Had only known each other a few months. 

It's 40+ years later. We have had a real ride. A lot of real life stuff. You know, ups and downs. Good and bad. And if you ask, I'd do it all again in a heart beat. "

"I adopted two neglected and abused parrots. I won't go into details because it can be pretty rough obviously but basically it's a lot of adjustment. 

My conure used to bite me a lot, hard bites just because... It takes a lot of patience and training to gain his trust back. Now he doesn't bite me anymore but he will bite the rest of the family, it's a work in process. He's also less afraid of his environment. He trusts that we won't randomly hurt him. 

My cockatiel is a total different story. I'm still working on getting his trust. He doesn't come on my hands and will run away from me or bite me when I give him hands. He will however come on my shoulders or arms... It's a matter of letting him getting used to it and trusting me. On the bright side he started whistling a lot and he stopped plucking himself, he looks so so sooooo much better than he did when he joined our family AND he finally bathes after never bathing his whole life."
You were not a stupid kid. You kept yourself alive in a horrible situation that was out of your control. Nothing about any of this was your fault.

"Not tipping for everything, and definitely not tipping as much as Americans. I was flabbergasted when my friend said he tipped the bartender for every drink, and I felt like a right arsehole for all the many drinks I've ordered in the US without it crossing my mind to tip. 

I'm also used to around a 12% tip for meals (or more like ""I'll leave a ¬£ or two"", or just eyeballing whatever amount of change looks decent), rather than 20% which is what my American friends told me. 

Now when I go to the US I try and tip everyone, and often they refuse it (like hotel staff carrying my bags) and I am confused about when to do it and when not to. "
"Emotional immaturity and the complete lack of desire to do anything about it. I'm willing to work with someone on building up those skills, but if they flat out refuse, that's a deal-breaker. I can't deal with someone who's almost 30 and has the emotional skills of a late teenager or early 20-something. I guess it's not a surprise he's now with someone almost ten years younger than him."

"In defense of Belle- after a rough start, the Beast clearly listened to her.  He understood her love of reading and gave her an entire library, knowing how much she would love it.  Up until that point only the old librarian understood why she loved reading.  Literally everyone else in her town seemed to think she was some kind of crazy freak for reading.  Even her father thought she should give Gaston a chance (a guy who only likes her for her looks/ proposes to her with the entire town there for the wedding ceremony which is supposed to happen seconds later).  

Yes there's the whole theory that she has Stockholm Syndrome, with her falling in love with her jailer. Honestly, though, after the initial freak-out, her fleeing, and then him saving her from the wolves they kind of talk things out.  She's patching up his arm and they fight back and forth, but then they start listening to each other. 

I don't buy the idea that Belle has Stockholm Syndrome.  I think she and Prince Adam have one of the more reasonable Disney relationships.  They get to know each other and fall in love.

And honestly- Prince Adam has every right to be mad.  He's an 11 year old kid home by himself.  His parents clearly told him about stranger danger and not to let anyone in the castle while they're gone. Some creepy looking lady shows up asking to sleep there.  Any smart kid would say ""No thanks"" and turn them away (PS. where the hell are his servants??).  Sure, turns out she's a beautiful sorceress.  But also vindictive as hell.  Turns him into a beast until his 21 birthday.  Puberty is hell, but gotta be way worse as a beast who has to desperately seek romantic love- not only to save himself but all the people who have been living in the castle.  The only woman he's met who isn't in his employ is his captive. He wants her to fall in love with him, but is convinced she can never love him because of his appearance. Aaaaand.. he's an orphan?

To me, Beauty and the Beast embodies two people meeting, helping each other, learning about each other, and coming to love each other despite their differences/ their pasts/ social pressure from those around them. 

Don't get me started on Sleeping Beauty though.. Don't marry someone you don't know who kisses you while you sleep. Creeper."
"If someone is looking at something in a grocery aisle, and I have to pass in front of them (thereby interrupting their view), I always forget to apologise because you just don't do it where I'm from. And personally I don't give a crap when people do it to me, so I don't feel like it's a bad thing.

But whenever I'm in the US, people say ""sorry"" ALL the time. Even if they're a few feet away from me! In fact more than once I've heard ""sorry"" before I even noticed they were there. Like, you definitely don't have to apologise if I didn't notice your existence - in fact I'm more inconvenienced by having to acknowledge your apology, than if you had just run by and not said anything.

I guess Americans have a different sense of personal space. Or perhaps because all the supermarkets in my city are so tiny and crowded in comparison, we've just accepted the fact that people will be passing near you all the time!"

"I live in a part of Canada where there aren't many Spanish speakers, so I always get a kick out of hearing it. This one Starbucks on campus has a lot of Latin American students as employees.

"Ugh, you're so right. Rom coms taught me that if a man was obsessed with me and ""nice"" then I owed him a chance, even if I was physically repulsed by him or terrified to be alone with him.

It led to a lot of pretty scary situations, and many years of completely miserable dating. "
"This, they make you question your own judgment and they make you think everything is your own fault.  You start thinking you deserve whatever they do to you.  

In my experience, whenever I was upset with something he did, he would apologize, he would grovel, he would make promises, he would say whatever he needed to so I would stay.  Then, over time, it became ""you overreact to everything"" then ""you're poisoning our relationship by being so resentful"" then ""but if you hadn't done this, I wouldn't have done that"" then ""you just get so angry sometimes"" then I would end up in therapy for anger management because I maybe raised my voice at him slightly.  He would laugh and tell our friends stories about how crazy I was, conveniently leaving out the episodes of abuse that upset me.  He had a lot of people convinced that I was an out of control alcoholic, when he was the one pressuring me to drink and pushing at my trauma triggers, then laughing and berating me and calling me crazy for breaking down and having panic attacks.  *I* was convinced I was this out of control crazy angry person and that I was lucky he was willing to put up with me.  

Then I broke up with him and the panic attacks and ""crazy"" stuff suddenly stopped.  "
Dumcum. First name was Jack. It still makes me giggle.
I think that it's fairly reasonable to protest in that way and that regardless of the reasons for protest (I personally think they're good) it's perfectly fine and okay to protest by refusing to stand for the national anthem. I also think it's kind of worrying that people are getting so upset about people not adequately and publicly performing for a symbol. It comes off to me as pretty gross and nationalistic that people are so outraged about perceived disrespect for a song.
This is an old song but Copacabana by Barry Manilow! When I was a kid the dance class I took danced to this happy sounding song.    Older I reliaized it was about a woman whose boyfriend is killed at the club she sings at and she becomes an alcoholic. 
"I have a pretty similar story here.

First off, I am a white, Canadian boy through and through.

I used to live in a building that had a lot of international students in it for university (it was a 10 minute walk to campus, and generally a fair bit cheaper than most other apartments in the area).  For the couple years I lived there, there was a very large population of Koreans (I would say about 1/3 of the building were Koreans).  

Well, I had just gotten out of a relationship with a Korean girl, whom I had dated for 2+ years, and I got to be conversationally fluent in Korean at the time.  Well, I was in the elevator going up to my apartment (the one real knock I had with this place was the elevators were soooo slow.  Going upto the 7th floor took about 45s).  and these two Korean girls were chatting in the elevator, they gave me a once up and down glance, and I didn't think twice of us, until they started making fun of me for being a little bit chubby, and a couple other minor things.

They threw out some pretty good insults, and thankfully I have a very stoic face, otherwise I would've laughed at a few of them (who doesn't love a good burn? or in my case, an aside, apparently :p).  So when my elevator got to the floor, I looked at the quieter girl and said ""Ya know, if her looks were as good as her wits, she'd be gorgeous"" in Korean... and BAM! It was like their entire faces became stop signs, they were instantly red.  So I get off the elevator laughing.

For the rest of the 6 or so months I was living there, if any Koreans got on the elevator, all their conversations ceased the moment they saw me.  "

"Started dating an exchange student. When he left, I stored a bunch of his things for him, as it'd be too expensive to ship and he wanted to come back to do his PhD. He wasn't able to come back as quickly as he wanted, and after a year and some change of long distance and we broke up. 

He tried to blackmail me. 

So I told his mom. She and I then arranged for a few thousand dollars of his textbooks and sheet music to be delivered to a family friend, but somehow I lost his beloved (very cheap, nearly broken, terrible) left handed banjo. It was nearly unplayable, he just kept it because he liked Zombieland.

"Usually, yes. They'll let you know how they're assuming you're fat and ugly and desperate and playing video games for attention. How they may or may not let you suck their dick. How much of a cunt you are and how much they hate you for existing. How any guy who stands up for common decency is a white knight, or any friend who refuses to join in on the assholery must be my boyfriend.   

If you stay silent, they assume you're trans or just start calling you ""it"" or ""shemale"" because that's so edgy and hilarious.   

If at any point you stop giving them any response they start standing in your way and blocking your movement, or throwing flashbangs and grenades at you to blind you or hurt you, or any other way of inhibiting your ability to play the game like a normal player.

So it goes. There are sometimes normal people who go ""Oh, okay."" And there are sometimes even more normal people who don't bother asking because why does it even matter. Those people are awesome and I tend to befriend them and play future games with them and then I am happy again and not mad at the world. "

"Not wanting to attend family functions. I get it, hes pretty introverted and would rather just stay at home with me and the kid. He doesn't like to engage socially unless it was his idea. It irks me a bit because I always feel like my family is judging my lack of husband attending things, but I know that the people I most care about understand him. 

The reason I let them go though is because he doesn't just do it with my family. He doesn't go to his family functions sometimes. I have been to a few where it's just me and the kid lol. Ah well, I still love him :)"
"I don't agree. 

It's obviously true that any two people who spend time together will experience disagreements and hurt feelings. They're both inevitable in the course of human existence. 

However, good relationships do require much less work than dysfunctional relationships. Healthy, happy people don't go around hurting other people if they can help it. Therefore, I think it is absolutely reasonable to strive for a relationship that requires less work. 

I definitely have that with my husband - which is why I married him. I dated scores of men before him, and there was always some level of discomfort or some disproportionate or inordinate amount of effort required to maintain peace. 

With my husband, things came easily. Relationship milestones (e.g. exclusivity, the first ""I love you,"" moving in, getting engaged) happened quite organically, without major orchestration. It was just obvious:  ""oh shit!  Monday is my least favorite day of the week now because I get sad that you go home. You should move in!""

At the end of the day, what it all boils down to is this. I know that he's going to fuck up. (And so am I.)  I know he's going to piss me off. (And so am I.)  I know we're going to disagree. But at the end of the day, it is EASY for me to trust that he's never going to do any of those things on purpose. The reason that I can trust that is that he's showed me over the entire duration of our relationship. It's been easy for him to show me that because that's who he is. "

"I started dating my ex fiance when I was 17 and he was 19. At first we were over the top, so in love, in a way only naive, inexperienced people can be. He was good to me, and very supportive. We got engaged when I was 21, and then my mother passed away unexpectedly and I called off the wedding. He got a job two states away and when I refused to move away from my family, he ripped the ring off my finger. 

We got back together and I moved (stupid, stupid, stupid) and he became very controlling. He didn't like me going out with my friends from back home. He encouraged me to not work so I would have to rely on him. He became very judgmental of all my friends and family. 

The first time he put his hands on me was during an argument (I don't even remember what it was about.) He stormed away from me and closed the bedroom door. I opened it and he grabbed me by the neck and threw me onto the bed and held me there for a bit. When he let me go I ran out, got in the car, and drove three hours to my dad's house. I didn't tell anyone what happened. He told me it was my fault for screaming and he was only defending himself against me. I never raised my hand to him, and he is a black belt.  I went back.

Things got worse. He made much more money than me so I always got my checks deposited in our joint account. He gave me an allowance and would monitor all my spending. I had to pay my own phone bill and ran out of food money and he told me too bad. I shouldn't go out so much. 

I came home from work one day and he screamed at me that I needed to marry him right away so he could get a tax break. That I was costing him money by not marrying him. 

The day I left, he assaulted me and waved a gun in my face. He told me he was protecting himself from me. He marched me around the house so he could make sure I didn't steal anything. He made me shower at gunpoint to get all the blood off me. The last thing he said to me was ""By the way, you've gotten fat."" I was 23 years old. 

I'm 29 years old and I have a wonderful job, home, dog, and boyfriend. Leaving was the best thing I ever did. I've heard that he's still quite insane, but due to me pursuing charges, he can no longer own a firearm which is a small comfort to me."

"The bride and groom had been trying to get pregnant for the longest time and she kept miscarrying. They kind of gave up on it and focused on planning the wedding and all. A bit before it, the bride found out she was pregnant. She didn't want to tell him in case she miscarried again, so she kept it to herself for awhile. 

The wedding rolled around and at the end of it, she walked up to him with a picture of the ultrasound framed and handed it to him. And I can't even begin to explain to you the emotion on his face. Everyone cheered and clapped and it was the cutest thing ever. They both cried and it was perfect. "

"My last ""well... shit"" moment was last weekend. I had a bug and got sick in the morning. Felt immediately better  afterwards and forgot all about it because I was going to a festival.

That same evening on the festival grounds I took a ride with my SO and his two friends in a thing that swivels and spins people around. Jumped off the ride as soon as it finished vomited.

Got up, tried to get some water at the bar, felt sick again, stumbled out of the queue and threw up some more. Collapsed on the ground with my boyfriend stroking my hair while I threw up two more times. 

Looked up at him and said ""I love you"" for the first time. "

"Not another language but here goes. I was on the subway in Tokyo. A group of American men, mid to late twenties, got on. They started talking about a few of the local girls on the train. How she has a nice ass, he's more of a boob guy, look at that one. Blah blah blah. The train jostled and one of them bumped me. He said ""sorry"" I said ""it's ok"" they all stopped and stairs at me. The guy said ""I thought you were German or something, didn't think you understood us."" I said ""Nope, and most people on this train can understand you too."" They were quiet until I got off the train. Hahaha. "
"CLINGINESS. And being put on a pedestal.

I cannot stand not having my space. It may have just been because I was his fist girlfriend (even though he was also my first official boyfriend too), but holy shit it's like he thought I was an angel on earth and was all over me all the time. I felt smothered and it was a **long distance relationship**. I'm not perfect. I don't want my boyfriend to think I am. I'm human, my boyfriend should be human, and we will be human together.

We dated for 4 months when I dumped him and it was like I took a shit on his moms dog and set his house on fire. Told people I was cheating on him in the relationship because I moved on quickly, etc. It was a massive dumpster fire. Fuck that guy.

Current relationship is amazing. We call each other out and take care of each other."
"I used a method similar to this. One of my managers used to tell me to ""Smile!"" every time he walked by my office. One time he did it and I looked at him and said ""How weird would it be if I just sat here alone smiling at nothing?! haha!!"" while smiling. He never told me to smile again!"
"I was living with my boyfriend of 2 and a half years when he dumped me. I found out a week after that he had also cheated on me. So when I moved out I took all the spices and herbs from the kitchen (technically I bought them all) even though I didn't need them in my new house.

I like the idea of him eating bland boring food."
"That men are fixers who never just complain in order to vent so they just don't *understand* how to just empathize with a problem.

Men vent just for the sake of it all the time, and if you immediately give them advice instead of just saying ""That sucks,"" they get really annoyed. I know this from much experience. And when guys complain to other guys, they aren't usually looking for a solution either - they want the other guy to either say ""that sucks"" or to share a similar story of woe. Guys vent like this together all the time.

Listening to someone you care about complain without trying to fix it is hard for everyone, but men have this cultural narrative telling them it's uniquely difficult for them and I just don't buy it."
"I had 2 exes who ended up being gay (nothing against gays, but this is just part of my romantic history). Both of them had drug issues and beat me. As far as sex, they both ""liked"" it, but they seemed to act funny during certain acts, such as an aversion to oral sex (on me)."

"He comes from a culture that does not value ""sharing a meal"" as much as mine does. To him, meals are mostly about feeding oneself. At least he does enjoy good food and trying new ones so there's that but overall, it's pretty sad.

ETA: it seems I wasn't clear. I meant sharing meal time as in sharing that moment of the day and the importance and pleasure of being together (in quality time not just physical presence) during them. I wasn't referring to literally sharing the food, although he was bad at that too (he got better).

English isn't my first language so I'm sorry for the poor explanation."
"I am the worst human being possible for this but it's something I'll never forget. When I was 11 or 12, a boy who was a couple of years older than me had already told me that he liked me. I had no experience with boys at this point in my life, and was a bit embarrassed that a boy had a crush on me, to be honest. When we were with friends in a group, he sent me a note asking me to be his girlfriend, which my friends all saw too. Feeling myself burn up, I answered with ""of course not and you're a stupid horse to think I'd like you like that"". I am dying just recalling it. It was out of embarrassment and peer pressure and ugh. I hate myself. It didn't turn out badly for him anyway, as he is now semi-famous singer and actor, who tours regularly and makes big money."

"How does he feel? I followed my fianc√© when he went to school in another city, got a job, and we were both miserable for a year. 

Talked it out, took a leap of faith, left our jobs/school, and eventually moved to the first city where one of us was offered a job. We've been here a year and our relationship is the best it's every been.

It might not be a relationship that's soured, it may be the scenery."
This is becoming more common in NYC because of how absurdly pricey floor space is.
"There's a movie on netflix with this premise called Timer. Everyone has a timer put into their arm to find their one true love (or in a less romantic description, the most suitable partner for them). It causes issues with existing couples who came together before the timer and individuals who don't have a timer yet/don't want a timer. 

Anyway, I'm in a relationship. I have been for years now. If there's someone more suited for me, I'd be shocked. I would not give up on my current relationship and probably just ignore this new information."
"Yes! That exact thing happened so many times with my ex. What I realized was the constant stream of ""sorry got caught up with something else"" translates to ""spending time together isn't a priority for me."" Never again. I don't have time to waste on being flaked on all the time. "
Literally just ask them for coffee or to the next big student union event or whatever. There's no need to beat around the bush by giving them googly eyes from across the room.
"Right?! I've seen NFL fans support rapists, wife beaters and whatnot, yet suddenly they're burning the jersey of a man who is not a criminal and did nothing wrong, only just didn't want to stand up for the anthem and he's met with criticism from all over the country? Fuck that shit."
"i think it's really sad that people in the NFL care more about someone peacefully protesting than they care about the violent abusers in the NFL. 

nationalism is unsettling. "
"Men? Commitmentphobes only. Food? Skipping dinner again. Job/career? Where do I even fucking start.

But I do wear sunscreen religiously. So I have that going for me. I floss too."
"Echoing what others have said here. I am so lonely, and also chronically ill, and don't have anyone to talk to about it.

I've been in constant pain for 5 years (longer really, but I used to drink it away). So I had to give up my dream career, and also lost all my friends because no one wants to hang out with a sad sick person. Haven't dated in years. I can't go anywhere or do much.

I'm on a work project now, a conference thing which happens a few times a year, and the people I see here are pretty much my only ""friends"". But I've been training a new person, and she's been going out to all the social events and making friends with all of them - they all hung out on their day off, and I've never been asked to hang out even though I've known these people for years. Even if they did, I'm too sick to go.

I've told people about why I can't socialise but they get sort of awkward and seem like they'd rather ignore me than be a shoulder to cry on, which is understandable.

The thing is this all started when my mom died, when I was young. I didn't want to lose my friends, so I suppressed everything with drugs and alcohol. I am sure this is why I have unexplainable health symptoms too, due to all this stress I never released.

Now I want to be sad, but it's extra hard being sad when you're lonely. 

Basically, I've learned that no one likes a sad person.

"I've had the Mirena (hormonal) IUD for 2 years and I love it. I was previously on BC pills for almost 10 years, I always had side effects and I hated taking a pill every day. I have had 0 side effects from the IUD, which I believe is because the hormones are directly released into your uterus as opposed to the full-body effect of BC pills. But obviously everyone's body is different so definitely talk to your doctor about potential side effects.

The insertion was painful and uncomfortable, but not unbearable, and super quick. Best to get it inserted while you are on your period, when your cervix is naturally dilated. I experienced some painful cramping beginning a few hours after the insertion and lasting through the night, but again it was not unbearable, no worse than bad menstrual cramps. Just have a heating pad and ibuprofen handy. I haven't felt anything since then, I was worried about having a foreign object inside me but I have never noticed it, and apparantly neither has my boyfriend. I spotted for a couple months after the insertion but since then, I get my period maybe once every 2-3 months max and it's super light and quick, which has been hugely relieving for me."
"I moved from Virginia to California to be with my long-distance girlfriend. We knew very early in the relationship that this was serious, and I didn't have family or a particularly good job there to keep me on the East Coast, whereas she had both. 

It's been over six years since I moved, and I've never regretted it. I genuinely like it here, though it's super expensive. This is also a better job market for me. 

PS We're getting married in April."
"I think my best friend is my husband.  He has a great penis.

The rest of him is pretty nice, too."
"Math teacher in high school.  

Besides him being a complete ASS, he handed back tests and quizzes from best score to worst score.  It was so stressful if most of the class had been given their tests back and you didn't have yours yet.  The whole class would then know who failed the test.  It really messed with my mind and made class even more stressful than it should have been.

He also addressed students as ""Bad Student"" or ""Good Student"".  He thought it was in good fun, but it was also another way for him to show the class who was failing the class.  I guess he thought the ""bad students"" would try to aspire to be ""good students"", but it did the opposite because their self confidence was shattered.  

My mom got me out of the class, the only time she ever got me to switch teachers because my grades were slipping fast.  Once I got into a new class, I was getting As.  

He no longer teaches there anymore because he was caught on video saying racist and sexist things about the new principal.  "
"Yeah, making child porn is definitely something he would have been charged with. Since it didn't succeed I wonder if he could have gotten charged with something. "
"You're very smart to realize that you can't make him quit, though! I have a theory about relationships: if one person does something, and the other doesn't, it eventually becomes a negative thing: drinking a lot, smoking, exercising frequently. In a weird way, it's almost better (not really, but you know what I mean) when both people smoke because it's a baseline for normal... I hope that he quits on his own at some point - he'll be happier and healthier all-around"
"Eh, I like to use gender neutral language at times when it's not necessary so that when it *is* necessary (like when I genuinely don't know someone's gender or preference) it's more instinctual and comfortable. "
"Its sad but art supplies. I want to be good at art but I just get frustrated because my hands can't do what my brain wants and sometimes the stuff in my brain doesnt actually make any sense and I get frustrated and quit. Still every few months I will be in a craft store buying stuff for a project I hope I dont suck at.

I am an ok cross stitcher though!"
"just bought something? ooh, i need this other thing to go with it!"
"Show aversion at first.  If it persists, politely but firmly kill them."
"Cardigans coming back into my daily rotation, fewer opportunities for shorts, chili &amp; beer nights, actually looking forward to curling up on the couch in the early evening darkness with tea and a thick book, all the cute boots I can wear with long skirts or jeans."
"Not dressing well. Unless I'm coaxing him to buy better clothes, he will always wear a ratty shirt and the same pair of tennis shoes and the same pair of pants. 

This is similar to the first point, but he can be too cheap at times to the point that he won't experience life fully, because he's always thinking about the cost.

Being a Trump supporter. Long story, but he became super conservative all of a sudden. I still love him and we have been together for years so I'm not going to break up with him because of his political beliefs.

Listening to his damn mom all the time. No I won't do what she wants us to do. "
"""God, Jerry! You don't deserve the internet!"""
"So I had definitely never actually thought about the words to Little Talks. 

""You're gone, gone, gone away
I watched you disappear
All that's left is the ghost of you.
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart,
There's nothing we can do
Just let me go we'll meet again soon
Now wait, wait, wait for me
Please hang around
I'll see you when I fall asleep""

...aaaaand I'm sobbing"
"I say something every time and grumpily pick it up. I hate it but it's not a deal breaker and I'm not going to dump him over it, but like, stop being a jerk, man. "
That last sentence. A+
"""What are you?""

""An avocado"""
"I'm too loud mouthed and too anxious to ever manage ""cool gf"" longer than maybe 30 minutes. Guy into NASCAR?  Sure, babe!  Let's watch. 15 minutes later ""they go in a circle. This is dumb. I'm going to do something else.""  He doesn't shut down a girl openly coming on to him with me right there?  Nervous giggle. Play it off. Five minutes later ""you see I'm right here, yeah?!""

I am just not a chill person. Oh well. "
"It's a biological difference as well as cultural difference, but sometimes I'm taken aback by how *adamant* Westerners are about compulsory deodorant for everyone over the age of 12. It's got to the point where I wear a little deodorant anyway, even though I'm 99.99% sure that I don't need it since I'm Japanese, I have dry earwax and neither of my parents have body odour."
"Not showering everyday is normal if you aren't sweaty, but the underwear kind of horrified me until I read the part about the bidet"
"He looked like Paul Rudd, worked at a cafe and was a musician. Never really said much to him but got in contact over his fb fan page. Confessed my crush to him, he asked for nudes that he could wank to.

Crush was over."
"Based on personal experience, eat beforehand, alternate drinks with water, and don't separate from the group."
"I remember when I found out I was pregnant 32 years ago it scared the hell out of me because it wasn't planned.  

Discovered I was really good at being a parent, partially because it forced me to stop being self-centred and be more self-aware.  Also turned out to be THE best thing in my life.  

Just went to a TIFF film with my son this weekend.  He's smart, funny, kind, interesting, ambitious, curious and fun to be with.  

Life is good.  I love my life.

"""I greatly enjoy watching you suffer through all the problems you created for yourself""


But I have to play nice due to work reasons."
"It was actually someone we know :/

We were supposed to be out of the house for the night, but our plans changed.

They believed that they knew the digital code to enter the house, and they did,  but they *did not* know that we changed the code pretty often on a totally random schedule. If they had tried the night before, their code would have worked.

My cat woke me up when they approached the house. I was upstairs and couldn't understand why she was upset until I heard the front door beep that an incorrect code had been entered. I could hardly breathe. Then I heard the door beep for a second time. 

I called 911 and just as I told the operator that someone was trying to enter the house, they shattered the front windows. We have a dog, but luckily he was uninjured because we had kenneled him for the night so he was unable to confront the intruder.

Although I live in a rural area, the barracks for the state police is less than five miles away. Within minutes we had 15 cars surrounding the property- they encircled the house quietly, and then they all at once flipped their lights and sirens.

They caught the person. They were in the middle of a bipolar episode. We decided to drop the charges, on the condition that they repair the windows. We've since purchased bars for all the first floor windows so the same method can't be used to enter the house.

Since the cat woke me up before they entered the house, the police were able to arrive before the intruder went upstairs, which prevented any kind of violent confrontation. 

We bought her a heated memory foam cat bed. I feel like she deserves it :)"
...tbh I can't tell who is who in this conversation. 
"OK but giving a strange kid candy is objectively a *terrible* idea. You can interact with kids, but don't give them food! good god."
Oh god that's awful 
"""How old are you? 32? Oh no plans to settle down?"". Oh drop dead asshole "
Had sex in ways I was not actually comfortable or into. 
"Nope. As a kid, my mother kept trying to force my dad to get my name changed from his (bio dad) name to my (abusive af) step dads name. I begged him to 'lose' the forms and he did, over and over again. 
My mum and I fought about it from when I was 8 until 16, at which point my dad bought me a copy of my birth certificate and I took it to get my name changed at school (I had been enrolled under step father's name). From that point on my mother knew she had lost and gave up.

I fought for 8 years to keep my name, I'm not giving it up for anyone (also I'm the last in my family with it; I wanna pass it on)."
"If you are gay, you aren't doing yourself or your boyfriend any favors. Time wasted right now could be used in helping both of you move on.

You can be with a partner who you are really attracted to, and your boyfriend can have a partner that actually wants him. Leaving is the right thing to do for both you."
"That may just be your friend's family. As an American, that's weeeeeeird. "
"I was on my period and feeling really unwell. A male coworker asked me what was wrong and I first I brushed him off with ""nothing"". But he asked again so I told him I was on my period. He filed a sexual harassment complaint against me with HR, so the next day I had to explain to the HR lady why I felt I needed to share with a coworker that I was menstruating. :-("
"Yup. I've got a friend who's a huge ~Facebook warrior and he's always sharing crap. And when people call him out on it, he just brushes it off like ""lol this is what I get for not fact checking but it'd still be fucked up if it were true."" YO BUT IT ISN'T TRUE."
"My SO will enter the name of a website into upper right search box,then click on it in the search results.  I have witnessed him search ""Google,"" click on Google and then Google what he needs multiple times.  At this point, I will simply look away and breath deeply when we are doing something on the computer together.

"This reminds me of one of my favorite poems by Rupi Kuar:

i do not want to have you

to fill the empty parts of me

i want to be full on my own

&amp;nbsp;

i want to be so complete

i could light a whole city

and then

i want to have you

cause the two of

us combined

could set

it on fire"
"Not the original commenter, but I'm totally fine with that. Or even ""are you (insert ethnicity here)?"" I don't expect people to be able to identify me as Chinese and I won't be offended if they guess wrong, but I get annoyed as hell when I tell them I was born and raised in Texas and all I get is ""so... Where are your parents from?""

ETA: wanted to add that the only time I've ever been flat out asked was when a friend of a friend had assumed I was Latina, but then heard me speaking Mandarin on the phone and her curiosity went into overdrive. I thought it was hilarious. Every other damn time has been ""where are you from? Where are you *really* from?"""
"As a child, I was allowed to dress up as male characters and no one blinked an eye (I totally had a Peter Pan costume). But if a little boy wants to put on a pink tutu it's like the world is coming to an end.

Edit: I was reminded of this recently when a friend posted something about a little boy who liked wearing a sparkly tutu because it made him feel beautiful and brave. Someone commented on it saying how it was absolutely not ok because parents should be guiding their children and not making them confused (??). I made pretty much this exact comment about my Peter Pan costume and completely shut her down. One of my recent proud moments :D"

I think what bothers me most is that Kap's protest was automatically associated with disrespecting the military. These two things don't have to be together. Like because I support Black Lives Matter doesn't mean I think all cops suck. 
"I'm Mexican American, he's white. My parents are a little worried because he can't speak Spanish and all the rest of my family lives in Mexico, but mostly they're just happy to share our culture with him especially because he has a high spice tolerance "
"If they say no, you could follow up with ""it should"" just to fuck with them."
"Dogs like him.  Like, all dogs.  I've never seen a dog not like him, even ones that normally don't like people.

He's extraordinarily good in a crisis.  He has fast reflexes and has grabbed me before my clumsy self broke a bone, dodged us out of accidents where the other people ran a light and such, and is generally very quick with a solution.  He's good at emotional crises too.  I have Bipolar I, sometimes I hallucinate.  He holds me while I yell at things that aren't there and swat at air like it's the most normal thing in the world to do.

He makes me laugh.  Even when I'm upset or sad, he always makes me crack a smile and laugh.

He entertains and even enjoys my fondness for ""devil's advocate"" and debating from all sides."
Do you have a photo of Buster and Popcorn together?
"""You're into girls and guys, right?""



""I am into every gender, so that is correct.""



""So would you be open to a threesome with another girl plus me?""



""I haven't even decided if I'm open to sleeping with you alone yet."""
"That men are expected to be denser than bricks when it comes to emotional intelligence. No, they should not get a free pass when they hurt someone else's feelings, it's not that they didn't know any better, they just didn't give a shit and would rather shrug off the responsibility."
"Broke up with boyfriend after he lied about where he was and who he was with all night and got into multiple explosive arguments that involved my family. We live together, so it's going to be a little while before he moves out. I just want him gone so I can start the healing process."
"Well, a *loving and supportive* relationship isn't about winning rounds of ""which of us is right"" and storing up ammunition from past wrongs to use against them in said bouts.  "
I hate how fucking messy my family is. They just leave shit everywhere and its like I live in an episode of hoarders 24/7. I can't wait to move out so I can embrace minimalism.
Wait so are you no longer mute then?

NYC tap water is divine. No bottled water could ever compare to our micro shrimp tap water.
"I hate my dad. He raped my mom, emotionally abused her into marrying him (she was pregnant from the rape and he went for the ""if you don't, our child is going to hell"" thing), then kicked her in the gut, lost that child, and raped her continuously until my brother and I happened. He molested me (we think my brother too, but we can't be sure - he's blocked it out and refuses to talk about it) and they divorced. Our lawyer said that ""full custody doesn't exist"" so I had to see my molester every weekend until I was about six/seven. He once attempted to burn his duplex down while the other family was inside. He let me DRIVE his motorcycle and car when I was four. He forced me to sled down a massive hill, but it wasn't covered in snow, it was covered in ice and led into a ditch. I have multiple half siblings. He once told my mom that it was her fault that she didn't know he had been in jail before because ""she didn't ask."" My brother while playing at his parents/our paternal grandparents house once found a loaded gun just sitting there...AROUND CHILDREN. His mom/our paternal grandma used to call my then-7 year old brother fat and gave him a complex he's still not over. We would go to ""family therapy"" following the divorce and he would get mad when I won, and not let me win, when we played CANDYLAND. 

My father is now a trans woman and I really hope that reddit can understand that I'm not transphobic, and in any other scenario I would absolutely use the correct pronouns, but he is NEVER going to change in my mind and I don't think he is worthy of human decency. He fucked up my mind too much and ruined my view of relationships for years that I'm still trying to work through."

"My fianc√© always puts half empty cans of soda into the refrigerator. He's not going to drink them because they go flat. Yet every time he drinks a soda, he drinks half or less than half and puts it in the refrigerator never to be drunk again. 

I've told him it's a waste of money but he doesn't seem to care. 

It's just one of those things that makes one think, ""why?!"""
"For those who don't want to look it up: 

The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
But when I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I hung my head and I cried.
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
I'll always love you and make you happy,
If you will only say the same.
But if you leave me and love another,
You'll regret it all some day:
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
You told me once, dear, you really loved me
And no one else could come between.
But now you've left me and love another;
You have shattered all of my dreams:
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
In all my dreams, dear, you seem to leave me
When I awake my poor heart pains.
So when you come back and make me happy
I'll forgive you dear, I'll take all the blame.
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

"He critiques my cooking like I asked him for his opinion even when its DELICIOUS, they're always something he's gotta be negative about. I don't know... I was rasied to fully appreciate mom's cooking and to keep it to myself if otherwise."
"I removed his access to every store loyalty card we had. I blocked him from renting movies on my account. 
I moved all of his things to the garage, and took him to court to get him to remove them from there. 
Some of his things ended up back in my garage. No one told me anything about this, so I sold everything. Months later he asked about that stuff. I claimed ignorance. I still haven't fessed up. 
When I packed his things, I put a picture of the two of us in every box.

"Not apologizing. Even if he was 2 hours late, it was metro's fault so he didn't owe me an apology.

He was also incredibly arrogant. He was the proudest person I knew with nothing to be proud of. He liked to act like the smartest person in the room despite barely graduating high school and a lack of intellectual curiosity. *That* relationship was the biggest folly of my youth."
My husband has assembled most of my professional outfits for me and I have a paper on the inside of my closet listing the items to wear together because I can't remember all the outfits he made.  I can't dress myself very well but he has a good eye for outfits and accessories.
