"Not to pull a ""get off my lawn"" or anything, but having been on the internet since the late 80's with BBS* (I hate you autocorrect) type shit, Atari's Genie and IRC even before AOL was a thing, it's straight up sexism. It's always been sexism. I've had the curious perspective of being able to see the evolution of this particular phenomenon over time.

It's a concept of a boys club that never was brought on by anonymity, a sense of male as default and ignorance of just how many people out there were female. At first, I think it was honestly just out of ignorance and a sense of ""well I'm a dude therefore everyone is a dude"" and when women, early on, brought up their gender they'd be pounded by PM requests in chatrooms. Didn't help that so many pub chats in the early-mid 90's straight up consisted half of the nerd mating call, ""A/S/L"". A lot of women just didn't bother talking about their gender out of fear of getting those pm's out of nowhere ""want to cyber?"" FFS I was 14 in the early *early* days of the wider internet when I learned to make a gender neutral name out of fear of constant sexual harassment

Time went on, video game companies stopped marketing to girls in general unless they were specific ""pinkified"" games despite the fact the user base didn't change all that much. As technology improved and voice became a thing, women didn't use it as much because of sexualization or being mistaken for 14 year old boy. (hmm... which sounds more appealing. Ransom dick pics, being called an adolescent and not taken seriously or just being silent)

It was made worse by 4chan's shitty-ass meme that declared if a woman indicates her gender in any way, she's only doing it for attention because ""gender doesn't matter online"" as though it's some sort of flat meritocracy despite the unironic ""tits or GTFO"" and extreme harassment of so many women online on a gendered basis. 

So many of these idiots who claim it's *not* gendered have no issue with men claiming their own gender either overtly and outrightly or through other means and they'll quickly and *angrily* correct anyone who calls them by the wrong pronoun. However, dare a feeemale to politely correct someone ""actually, it's she"" Even after a whole story about their first period while they were trying on bras, with their boyfriend, and their mother who shares their same name etc etc is met with ""NOBODY CARES IF YOU""RE A GIRL ATTENTION WHORE"" type stuff. It could be really aggressive and seriously uncalled for. Meanwhile men freely talked to each other about being men, about their genitals, about what they find sexually appealing and once reddit opened up to more than just technology- Oh god the sexual imagery of women. Why might women not flock to it with all the comments in those thread? It's a fucking mystery.

I created this subreddit after twoxchromosomes was too inundated by men asking ""DO WOMEN LIKE X..."" questions./r/Twoxchromosomes is so named because /r/women was snapped up by power user men who give no fucks about it- to this day. They just wanted the name. 

Shortly after creating this subreddit it was flooded with ""WHY IS THERE NO ASKMEN"" and most conversations were about men despite trying to carve out a space where *women* could answer questions. Any questions. Because seriously askreddit was askmen back then. ""reddit, what kind of boobs do you like"" ""reddit, who is hotter, Selma Hayak or Natalie Portman"" ""reddit, when was the last time you caught your dick in your zipper"". Good luck trying to ask about Brad Pitt Vs Johnny Depp- the funny thing is they were more likely to assume you were gay than a woman. 

So this space was created. We existed. A lot of people *still* didn't believe we were women and a lot of people *still didn't believe our opinions mattered.* On anything. At all. Even one of the mods of askmen had the fucking audacity to come *here* and post that shitty 4chan  meme about ""no girls on the internet ""because gender doesn't matter"" Mother fucker, you mod a subreddit called askmen. Clearly gender matters to you. 

The message is gender matters, but only if that gender is male. If it's female, it should be silent and unnoticed. 

Edit: if you came here to reply to me to defend this nonsense, stoppit. First off, I've got shit to do today so I'm not going to he each and every one of your hands and patiently explain to you why it's pretty clear you didn't read any of that wall of text up there and that you're *still* being sexist. Second I don't need a legion of 20 year olds trying to explain a thing to me that I watched develop while y'all were still watching Dora the explorer. Third, y'all are completely bypassing the fact that pEople say it TO women. Actual women. Not men they think are pretending to be women but to women. To shut them up. Literally. It's a thing they do. Tell womb to not talk about th fact that they're women even when relevant to the conversation (which again goes back to the fact that those twits didn't bother to read this shit, they just wanted to assert themselves by proclaiming, apparently, I either don't exist or I'm an attention whore or a dude or a banshee or a land shark or something.)

"I've basically had this experience 100 times: 

**Creepy dude**: Hey hunni, you're cute! Wanna hang / bang? (etc.) 

**Me**: Hey, I'm sorry - but I'm not interested. 

**Creepy dude**: Aww don't play shy with me. You're gorgeous babe, how about it?  

**Me**: Genuinely not interested. 

**Creepy dude:** Ha! You actually thought I wanted to fuck you? You fat piece of shit. Walk on, thunder thighs! Literally was only paying you attention because I heard fat girls put out and they suck dick, otherwise I wouldn't go near you with a 10 foot pole. Good luck finding someone to go near your loose vag, cunt!

"That we will eagerly perform all kinds of often unpleasant and sometimes unsafe sex acts, with negligible foreplay, and that this will lead to quick and noisy orgasms. "
"it's kind of funny.. you get plenty of attention from all sorts of guys, but each and every one of them believes that he's doing something charitable and generous by being interested in you despite your weight, since *most* men wouldn't even give you a chance.

at my heighest weight, i regularly had proposals to drive over to a guy's house and give him a blowjob. seriously. no date, not even a ''netflix and chill'' implication that the sex would be in any way mutual. and they would be LIVID if i said no because that kind of proposal was doing me such a massive favor."
"&gt; The message is gender matters, but only if that gender is male. If it's female, it should be silent and unnoticed. 

*That* is why I always correct someone who assumes I'm a man on the internet. I do it with humor, I do it in a friendly way, I do it even though I don't particularly mind being taken for a guy -- but I do it. Because being visible matters. 

Thank you for the outstanding post, and thank you for /r/AskWomen. I love it here. "
"That our vaginas will smell like fresh flowers and clean laundry or whatever. I mean, it shouldn't smell *bad*, or fishy, but it DOES have a smell, and it is NOT like mangoes or cotton candy or whatever they fuck they seem to think it should smell like.

Also, like a lot of other posters in this thread, I feel like a lot of the boys I dated in high school were way too horrified about periods, body hair, and other natural functions of the female body. They seemed to not want to acknowledge that girls are just people."
"I make a decent living but it still bothers me when people make assumptions about others' finances, like ""Oh it's only $5, everyone can afford that.""

No. Not everyone can afford that.

It also *really* bothers me when other people make decisions with my money. ""I bought this spa weekend. I figured we'd all go and chip in $50."" It may only be $50 but it's my money, not yours to spend. My family does this to me all the time."
"I received this message a few times when I was online dating and for some reason they'd get *so mad* when I'd reply, ""Aww, even the fat girl won't fuck you. How sad for you."" "

"That we'll see repeated attempts of theirs for something they want (after we've said no) as doggedly persistent or charming, and will reward them accordingly.

"
"I'm either a secret or a fetish. Only one man has been proud to date me (and claim me publicly). The rest were either saving me from my singleness or happy to sleep with me but not acknowledge my existence to anyone. I've had 4 men tell me they'd marry me if I were smaller. 

People make endless comments on my weight, size, etc. How I should have bigger boobs for my size or how my thighs are too big. I've started keto recently and is going well, but people comment on that as well. Sometimes they mean well. But past bullying means I don't trust anyone's comments to be well intentioned. "
Hairlessness. Particularly if it is requested by a hairy man. 
"My SO is obese. After a health scare 2 years ago, he's been trying to change his eating habits so that he eats smaller portions, drink only water/seltzer water, less sweets, and all that jazz. But he'll always start the whole smaller portion/healthy eating thing, give up 3-4 days into it, and then crash and burn for a month or two. Repeat 8-9x. 

He gets frustrated with himself and complains about how hard it is all the time. Then he gets frustrated with me because I'm supposed to keep him on track and I'm not doing what I'm ""supposed to"". Yeah, like I can actually stop him from eating multiple pb&amp;j sandwiches at 11pm. 

We got into an argument about it one time. He kept blaming me for his lack of discipline and I was just so tired of his bullshit. In the heat of the moment, I told him he was a fat ass, he'll always be a fat ass, so just give up, it's not like he didn't before. 

I don't exactly regret what I said. But I do regret how I worded it and how it came out."
"Be the best you that you can be. And be as kind to yourself as you are to others. 

Also remember: No one is as focused on and critical of you as you are.

Another good thing to remember: As we get older, looks fade. Being well-kept with good hair and clothes will mean more and more as you age."
"The involvement of his mother. Boundaries, Jesus Christ."
"I had a physically and mentally abusive meathead of an ex-boyfriend. His dad treated his mom the same way and never showed any emotion towards his kids (my ex and his brother). One day, after receiving a series of dehumanising insults, I looked him in the eyes with a straight face and said: ""You can keep trying to put me down to make yourself feel better but it won't make your daddy love you."" No regrets whatsoever."

"YES. I feel like it's some sort of weird fantasy for men -- they want the slim, petite girlfriend who can chug down beer and hamburgers daily. The pretty, well-dressed girlfriend who doesn't spend too much time/money on ""frivolous"" hobbies like makeup and clothes. 

It's like my boyfriend's worldview shattered when he noticed I spend 20 minutes straightening my hair every morning. ""You mean your hair doesn't naturally look like that?"" "
"Commented about this recently - went on a date a while ago, the guy told me he liked my style because I wasn't wearing 'a lot' of make-up.

I laughed and listed off all the products I was wearing."
"Shoes off! Shoes on in the house is such a weird American practice to me. It just strikes me as fundamentally gross, especially because my apartment has carpets."
"&gt; Men always say that as the defining compliment, don’t they? She’s a cool girl. Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she’s hosting the world’s biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because Cool Girls are above all hot. Hot and understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead, shit on me, I don’t mind, I’m the Cool Girl.

From Gone Girl. This ... Concept? Had been floating around for a while (see: [Female Chauvinist Pigs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_Chauvinist_Pigs)) but Gillian Flynn hit the nail on the head with this description (as much as I hated that character in Gone Girl)."
"I genuinely think that on some level, many men *do* - whether they're as big or bigger than women.

Because society places so much value on a woman's physical appearance. So when she's not pretty,  it's a much bigger deal than when a guy isn't handsome."
"Most of the advice here is disingenuous as all get out: ""Be yourself,"" ""Real beauty is on the inside,"" etc.

The reality is that unattractiveness *does* hinder people socially, romantically, and professionally. Your best bet is to exploit the hell out of whatever appealing features you do have by practicing impeccable hygiene, dressing to flatter your body, getting regular haircuts, learning to apply makeup, etc.

You may never be able to compete with somebody who's naturally an 8 or a 9, but you can improve your own odds by playing up whatever assets you have to work with."
"I don't condone saying this but I was angry at the time. His dad is an asshole, does hard drugs, begs us for money, ect. Well after his dad pissing me off too much in a week, I told my husband it wasn't fair that his dad was alive and mine wasnt.

Now who's the asshole? :("
Well they're both condescending as hell
"I applied for a job and got an interview. Wrote a stellar cover letter, met all the qualifications, assumed I had a really good shot of getting it.

Well, I was also applying to lots of other jobs at the same time, and by the time I had scheduled an interview for the job in question I had sort of...forgotten what exactly the job entailed. No worries, I'd look up the job description on the website to refresh my memory. Except it had been taken down. No worries! I'll look at my cover letter to remind myself.

Confident that I remembered what the job description had said, I went into the interview referencing what I *thought* the position was about. And after about an hour of what I thought was a knock-it-out-of-the-park interview, the team who was interviewing me paused and asked if I really knew what the job was for, and that it did not include direct service and other aspects that I had referenced.

Yep, definitely felt like an idiot. The interview ended soon after, I cried in my car of shame and embarrassment, and did not get the job. But I did learn that in the future I should just pick up the phone and call HR if that ever happened again, and I also began saving job descriptions to my computer when applying."
"So many young guys want a girl who is both sexually inexperienced and yet a total freak in the sheets. They want a girl who hasn't had much sex before them, but they want her to be doing anal and deepthroating on their first night together. "
"That dick + vagina = mutual orgasm. Nothing is taught about the importance of foreplay to stimulate the secretion of self-lubricating materials in the vagina that will make sex 5000x more comfortable for both partners, and most young guys don't realize that the average woman needs about 10 minutes of foreplay plus explicit clitoral stimulation to be able to reach orgasm.

It's also a shame that a lot of young guys don't realize how little the size/shape of their dick matters. Like, unless it's significantly large/small, it's literally not something we care about for the vast majority of women. 

Also, it's so goddamn annoying when dudes brag about ""how tight a pussy is."" Like, dude, most girls are only tight *if they're not properly aroused.* That's like bragging about how loud your car is because you're racing it with the emergency brake on lmao."
"I'm white and was dating a black man. He loved to show me all the instances of racial injustice. Some of them were legit, but others just weren't. Everyone was a racist, including me. He'd told me a few days prior that I only wanted him for the stereotype on dick size, even though we'd been together for 5 years at that point. Then he informed me his boss was treating him poorly because of his race. His black boss. I finally said ""ever thought that people are jerks to you cause you're an asshole? Not cause you're black?"" I realized in that moment that I didn't like him anymore. But I do not regret it at all."
"Their username was ""my_ex_was_a_bitch"" and he mentioned how awful his ex was repeatedly throughout the profile. Yikes. He actually messaged me, and included a part about how I seem totally nice and chill... Unlike his *bitch ex*. Hard pass on that one."
"* Hairlessness
* That young women will flock to them for just existing
* That women exist to make their lives easier
* That women are slot machines you put kindness coins into until they get rewarded with sex
* That it's okay to objectify women, and doesn't hurt them long-term
* That women are somehow complex or mysterious in a way that they can't possibly fathom - it puts women on a pedestal *and* dehumanizes them"
"I've posted this before in other threads.  He would be extremely mean to people (family, friends, not just me) and brush it off as teasing, make the person feel like they had no sense of humor.  But if he was teased in even a mild way, he'd flip out.

It sounds small, but that was the first sign that something was really wrong."
"That they will be the ""cool girl"" - love all of his hobbies, never start ""drama"" (read: disagree with him), effortlessly remain thin while eating like a teenage boy.

That a girlfriend can and should take care of 100% of his emotional support needs."
I... don't remember. Which makes me think I just go around hurting people while being completely unaware. 
"Before I left the food service industry I was surrounded by ""free spirit"" girls who take vacations to fill up their instagram and claim they bartend for the flexibility, when in reality their parents give them money. "
I am pretty sure all of my pets would demand to go to an all-you-can-eat buffet.  Because they are obsessed with food.
"What you would do if an ultrasound came back with issues.  We hadn't considered that as we were young and  healthy, but both pregnancies had major scares.  Being married to a Catholic while I myself am not meant we had very different opinions I thought.  Turns out we were on the same page, but that could have ended up horrible."
"In my opinion, the line is about prioritizing. As long as you are healthy about your other important items in your life, I don't care how much time/money you spend on your hobby.

My personal example - my husband is a gamer. He plays Warhammer and XWing. As long as it's not interfering with the amount of time we're spending together, or with his focus at work, and as long as he's not spending grocery money on miniatures, he's welcome to game/paint/strategize as often as he likes."
"I thought out a whole response to this and started writing it but honestly it made me want to burst out crying.

People don't realize how difficult it is to live paycheck to paycheck, to have nothing, and to constantly feel shamed by everyone you know for not saving for retirement. And you *know* that anything, anything at all can knock you off your very precarious position and you end up homeless, or not able to get the medical care you need. "
"That I had been faking orgasms for the first six months of dating. 

My previous relationship was shit, and that's what I thought women did. He was so upset he cried and didn't talk to me for a couple days. 

We're married now. So I don't regret telling him, but I'd definitely recommend not faking things with SO's... and if I could do it over I'd probably have told him differently."
"I think it is laughable when financially secure people talk about how irresponsible it is to not have a 3 or 6 month safety net.

"Yesterday I put my external hard drive in my backpack, then immediately got up from my backpack and started searching my house, looking for that same external hard drive so I could put it in that same backpack, all the while thinking to myself ""I could swear I just saw it but I don't remember where."" I put it exactly where I wanted it, then immediately forgot.  It took me an hour to realize it was already put away, after I'd already given up on it and returned to my backpack for something else. "
People ask me why my psn user account is a male name. I've been on the internet since the early 90s. The internet itself is why.
"He had told me all his past girlfriends had cheated on him. Eventually discovered that his sex frequency was something like once every two months. After about twelve times (do the math) I said in a fight, that now I understand why they all cheated on him.

 It was harsh. I regret that. Besides, one could argue that if the frequency is not enough, one can break up, not cheat. But he is a clingon too and not only he expected monogamy while not sleeping with us, he wouldn't let any of us break up either..."
"I have fought this shit forever. Like seriously. There was a period of time I regularly referred to dudes who kind of ignored all my gender clues as women and they, almost without exception *freak out*. They don't just correct you, they get ANGRY and correct you. Just by using a simple she instead of he in chat. 

I used to be in some active steam groups that had chat up all the time and friends would go along with me on it if they fucked with anyone for being female. The assholes would g LIVID over the wrong word. I miss those folk. They were made of awesome. "

"The first time I ever got gas

"And if we don't, it's because there's something wrong with us. Because obviously sex isn't something women enjoy - it's something that happens to us. "
"The expectation that we should always be hairless from the eyelashes down.

It's just...kind of absurd. It means we spend a lot of time shaving. Or a lot of money on waxing, and even then there's a grow out period. But guys don't want to even see that stubble, they want absolutely soft and smooth skin. 

It's just so strange how men will consider body hair disgusting or unhygienic...*but only on women.* Their body hair is fine  - never mind that if they shaved their underarms too they'd smell a lot better, or that I don't want to floss my teeth with pubes when going down on them either, it that I don't find hair backs/chests at all attractive.

I don't mind shaving for someone; if he's hairy, I want him to do the same. But I veto men who think my natural body is actually disgusting. If you can't handle a little leg stubble or that I like to keep a little of my pubes on the front, we're not compatible - I get busy sometimes, and I'm not a damn Barbie doll."
"Some men genuinely won't interact with me. It's so strange. Like they will literally talk to every other woman in the office then skip over me, even when we're talking about relevant business.

I still date just fine though, and dress nicely and eat good food. So in my own life, the things that matter, all is fine. I just get baffled sometimes that ""I don't want to fuck that person"" translates into ""I don't need to speak to that person"". Just goes to show their underlying misogyny I guess?

I get no nice treatment. I am recovering from an ED, and back then I used to get given free shit all the time, and opportunities that I thought were because I was competent but now know was largely because I was attractive to them. Which feels weird? I have the same pretty face now.

It makes me value the people who do value me more."
"Expectations of each other. This is pretty broad so I'll give some examples...

- His expectations of what I would actually be doing on a day to day basis while on maternity leave, as he was the sole income. I assumed that I needed to keep the house spotless, all chores done, dinner on the table when he got home... (the stuff that would slide when I was working full time). Of course in reality the house was even more of a mess and I spent  a couple of months feeling guilty, but when I actually spoke to him about it he was understanding that I had my hands full as a FTM and just because he was paying for everything I didn't have to suddenly keep everything ship shape. Which brings me onto...

- My expectations of how much he would help with chores. We didn't speak about it because like I said above I assumed that I would be able to take care of and manage everything. In hindsight, we should have realistically assigned chores to be done, as it gets very irritating having to keep asking for the most basic of help when you're trying to look after a tiny human

- Care of the actual baby, things like how will night feeding/comforting be handled, how to bath a baby, how to change a nappy properly, how to administer medicine, how to properly bottle feed... literally how to do anything. Those post partum emotions got me seriously hating on my husband for every little thing I felt like he wasn't doing right. I had done all my research before DD was born but he didn't, which meant he was learning on the job by himself. We should have learnt together! I highly recommend watching videos together, if you're not going to go to antenatal classes

- Discussing the different options of returning to work, if you have options available (to help with financial planning)

- Daycare tours, getting on the wait list before the baby comes, and also seriously discussing the costs involved

- How will groceries get done. Consider switching to online shopping!

- When does mum get a break? Make a plan for actual alone time every day, just an hour, so that you can unwind, go for a walk, have a bath, text your friends.. whatever.. without tiny human stuck to you - dad should try to commit to this (if tiny human permits of course) *Additional edit*: I've been asked about when dad gets his alone time. This has changed over time but our current pattern with a 7 month old is that he gets home at about 6.30pm, just as she's getting out the bath, he will get changed/shower, then give her evening milk. While he's doing that I will generally tidy up and then at 7pm I put her to bed. Once she's asleep, we both get wind down time BUT he will go to her if she stirs or anything, until we go to bed - then through the night it's me that will look after her if she needs anything. In the first couple of months, there was no alone time at all as she wanted to breast feed all the time. Dad is a big sports fan so he generally just watches sport each night and then at the weekend he will go play golf or something. We have no family nearby (I'm an expat and he moved to the city from the bush), so we do rely on each other if we want to go and have scheduled fun haha. As the baby has grown and I've got better at managing her, I do go out in the daytimes with her now and run errands etc, but that was really hard to do for the first three months so I guess that's when I needed to know I would get a small break. One day, when LO was 2 months old, I had to go somewhere for the whole day so dad had her alone for the first time to himself. When I got home he was pretty frazzled and that was really when he started to take my requests for some help seriously.

This is my list, I feel like there's so much more..! I'll come back if I think if anything else

Edit: I remembered something!

-Breastfeeding. My experience was completely not what I thought it would be. Long story short, my supply was basically non existent (even with prescribed lactation medication!), and I had begun my motherhood journey desperately wanting to succeed with breastfeeding. My husbands knee jerk reaction to my mine and my child's tears was to whip up a bottle of formula, which I know in hindsight now was the right thing to do. What I wish we had talked about was how he could help me manage my own expectations of myself, and provide reassurance. For example ""Hey, I really want to breastfeed but if it doesn't work out, please can you help me by reassuring me it's not my fault and it's more important for baby the eat than be upset that it's not working"" etc etc etc. Comfort and reassurance does come naturally to some men but for mine, I feel like this convo was an absolute necessity and would have helped me through a very dark time.

So sorry for mistakes, I'm tired, forgive me!!

"Within days of us getting together (we were friends for years), I ran into his old best friend. They didn't have a falling out, they just grew apart as this friend went to college, got a girlfriend, etc. 

The friend said to me ""Oh, he'll have eyes only for you, I know that. But you need to think long and hard about getting into that relationship because I think it will be very hard for you to get out.""

When I questioned that, he told me"" He has serious abandonment issues. I mean it. Once he has you, he won't let go.""

Very ominous and ultimately, turned out to be true. Gosh, I should have heeded it. I wish I knew how to get into contact with this guy (he was also an old schoolmate of mine) just to tell him ""thank you for warning me. I wish I had listened."""
"Not a total turn off but I find it really intimidating if a guy seems to have an over abundance of high intensity hobbies - like if his Tinder profile is a pic of him waterskiing, followed by playing in his band, followed by snowboarding, followed by bungee jumping, followed by him on his motorcycle.  

It's not bad, I just get intimidated and feel like he'd be bored or turned off by my lack of really cool hobbies.

I'm fine with moderate interest in these but hyper focused interest on running, lifting, guns, and anime are not my cup of tea.  "

Hot and understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead, shit on me, I don’t mind, I’m the Cool Girl.

&gt;Men actually think this girl exists. Maybe they’re fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl. For a long time Cool Girl offended me. I used to see men – friends, coworkers, strangers – giddy over these awful pretender women, and I’d want to sit these men down and calmly say: You are not dating a woman, you are dating a woman who has watched too many movies written by socially awkward men who’d like to believe that this kind of woman exists and might kiss them. I’d want to grab the poor guy by his lapels or messenger bag and say: The bitch doesn’t really love chili dogs that much – no one loves chili dogs that much! And the Cool Girls are even more pathetic: They’re not even pretending to be the woman they want to be, they’re pretending to be the woman a man wants them to be. Oh, and if you’re not a Cool Girl, I beg you not to believe that your man doesn’t want the Cool Girl. It may be a slightly different version – maybe he’s a vegetarian, so Cool Girl loves seitan and is great with dogs; or maybe he’s a hipster artist, so Cool Girl is a tattooed, bespectacled nerd who loves comics. There are variations to the window dressing, but believe me, he wants Cool Girl, who is basically the girl who likes every fucking thing he likes and doesn’t ever complain. (How do you know you’re not Cool Girl? Because he says things like: “I like strong women.” If he says that to you, he will at some point fuck someone else. Because “I like strong women” is code for “I hate strong women.”)

"I told him he was just like his father. He refused to sleep in bed with me for two nights. The first night I listened to him cry all night. I felt terrible. Not wrong, but it wasn't the way to say what I meant. Delivery is everything."
"I never understood how some people got the idea that women had easier times in video games once other players knew they were women. 

Maybe this was the world for some women. I hear my boyfriend and his friends talk about ""mount whores"" who used the fact they were girls to get other players to buy them mounts in WoW. Or girls on Twitch who flaunt their boobs to get donations while playing LoL. 

I never had that experience - anytime I mentioned I was a girl I had negativity. If I played bad, it was because I'm a girl. If I played well, it was because someone helped me, if I didn't like a game, it was because 'most girls don't', if I liked this game but I didn't know x,y,z about the game then I was a fake girl gamer, if I used a mic it was because ""I just wanted attention."" 

Hell, I corrected someone on Reddit not too long ago about my gender and I was downvoted to hell. 

Even up until now, playing Destiny and trying to find fireteams, you have to talk to people, I've had people kick me as soon as they hear me, or try to be my friend and add me on social media just because I'm a girl. I just want to play the game. I don't want negative or special attention based on my vagina.

And it not just the gaming world, it goes into all male dominated media. I got asked the other day if I knew about the show Rick and Morty. I told him yes. He asked who had told me about it. 

No one told me about it. I found it. Myself. 

This is the problem with sexism today. It's not huge ""women can't vote"" sexism. But it's micro, little tidbits of sexist comments and reactions that wear us all down over time. It's hard to explain why it's so hurtful when it sounds so trivial to the outsider. "
I pointed out to him that forcing sex on me after I'd explicitly said no was actually rape. He got really pissy and asked why I was trying to upset him. 
People taking pictures of other people and putting them on the Internet without their consent. Like seriously? Mind your own goddamn business. 
"His profile picture was him point a gun at the camera and he loudly proclaimed ""No black chicks, I am proud of my white heritage.""

My only consolation is that with his poor muzzle control and trigger discipline, he is likely to blow his junk off shoving his gun back into his hip holster and he probably won't breed. "
"I love porn. Don't get me wrong. But any person that has those expectations sexually for a female just shows their inexperience.

Also the ease of emasculation any guy feels due to a female being smarter than them.

Or not finding them funny.

Or heaven forbid correcting them.

"
"You said it! Literally every guy I've been with expected this. Mind you, my sample size isn't very large, but 4 of the 5 dudes I've slept with were very normal/kind/thoughtful outside of a sex context so it was impossible to ""tell"" that they would be this way. 

Blowjobs are *expected* of you, and you providing this blowjob should be enough foreplay for you, despite the fact that he won't touch your clit or kiss you. Then that's followed with very hard and fast pounding of your vag (from a position that makes any kind of clit stimulation impossible), even though you're still not wet due to selfish foreplay, and then he cums. He asks you if you cum, and say no. Anger/annoyance from the guy ensues and it is directed at *you* for not cumming because your lack of orgasm isn't a turn on for them. 

Want to note: have also told my partners what felt good for me in bed, some of them would do it for like 3 seconds and then go back to fucking me the way that they pleased. "
"I always had a bit of a crush on Alan Rickman, way back from the Truly, Madly, Deeply days. Sad he is gone."

"to be perfectly fair, i think this was a very understandable response to someone blaming you for holding them back from their life goals when it's fully in their control.

my ex got super obese, claimed he was a body builder before he met me, that he only ate every second day, and never kept any unhealthy food in the house. all with this air of blame, like it was simply impossible to NOT drink an entire 2 liters of cola simply because i kept it in the house (drank one glass a day). or impossible to go back to his high-and-mighty alternate day fasting even if i want to eat every day like a fatty.

at one point i snapped too because god damn it that victim shit pisses me off. and you bet he hasn't either gotten a job or lost weight since i left 6 years ago, even though i'm no longer there to hold him back."
"How we were going to share the role of disciplinarian. Unfortunately it seems to default to me. I don't mind being the one who enforces rules, but I wish he'd be more active in backing me up. He's never contradicted my rulings (time out, no cartoons, etc), but he also never takes initiative in correcting bad behaviors on his own. "
"ugh once when I corrected someone, I got the ""no nudes, I checked"" reply, just so everyone would know not to waste their time pretending to value me as a person "

It was in the parking deck next door. "

"I feel like a lot of men, especially younger men (and *especially* on the internet), don't understand that women have a rich internal life just like they do. They also expect that their partners will shape their lives around what he wants. It could be anything from spending less time with a hobby he's not into to being submissive in bed. I see a fundamental lack of empathy for women constantly in the world."
"Maybe I'm naive, but...

How does this sort of thing happen? There are just as many fat men out there as there are fat women. Do all the guys out there with man boobs and a beer gut honestly thing they're more desirable than a pudgy woman?"
"We should've discussed how to deal with his mother's *attempts* to be involved. Her overbearing advice and whatnot.  His way was to just ignore her, let her say her piece and do whatever he wanted to anyways. Even if it involved insulting me, which it started to cause once I had her grandson I was 'family' therefore open to her verbal abuse. I don't tolerate that shit.

She commented on something I posted on facebook insulting my parenting choice, calling me a child. Told her I HAVE a child I am not one, and that if she wants to parent another baby *go have one yourself*, because this one is MINE, so keep your 'advice' to yourself unless asked thanks.
 
Husband apologised to her for that one. Yeah we had a bit of a fight over that, don't fucking apologise for me. Ever. I did nothing wrong. She doesn't view us as adults or respect us as parents.

Um sorry, I get on the topic of her and can't help but rant, oh gosh. She just got worse and worse, and husband just ignored her, then her and I got into a huge fight, and my son and I haven't seen her in over a year. And she won't be meeting the daughter I'm pregnant with either. 

Soo, people need to get on the same page about how to deal with parents and overbearing people. How to shut them down. Discuss their parents to figure out appropriate ways to, because he knew his mom was batshit and never told me, so, that would have been nice to know."
"when i talk about how hard it is to find shirts that fit (i'd generally be a medium if not for my chest), ""just buy larger shirts and get them tailored! it's not that much!""

yeah, all of my clothes are from goodwill, on half-off day. $15+ to have a shirt altered is more than 2x the price i paid for it to begin with. i'm sure it's no big deal to some people, and i'd love to be able to afford tailoring (and i'm getting a sewing machine in part so i can learn to do it myself), but plz. "
"Your first point was so beautifully shown in the file. ""Pursuit of Happiness"" (I think is the title). His boss asks to borrow $5 for parking like it's no big deal at all, and you can see him physically worrying. A lot of people do that with small amounts, without realizing how closely you watch pennies when you're broke

To your 2nd point, I also agree, and it's irksome when people don't acknowledge external costs. I went to a wedding where they ""only spent about $6K!"" but didn't seem to acknowledge that we hosted people, traveled, bought stuff, built stuff, toted stuff, and all the other hidden costs. They made decisions with our money with seemingly 0 idea of just how much they did so"

"Great comment and exactly my experience as well! The amount of attention my gendered username got when I was *13 years old* playing Call of Duty on the PS3 was seriously uncalled for. I was sent message after message, harrassed in game over mic, and asked seriously inappropriate things by obviously older men. Then people wonder why women don't make themselves blatantly known on the internet."
"And be healthy. I can't stress this enough. Eating crappy food and not exercising can add to the issue. Get plenty of sleep, keep your skin clean to avoid breakouts, take walks to keep yourself trim, and you'll not only look more healthy but you'll also feel healthier too. Never underestimate what a little maintenance can do for you"
"Oh boy - I just had this moment this weekend. For context, my girlfriend is in recovery for an opiate addiction and has over 100 days clean at the moment.  
  
We got in an argument and I called her a piece of shit junkie who would never *not* be a piece of shit. I feel sick typing it out even days later.  
  
I regretted it almost instantly. I had about a minute and a half of like...feeling like I had somehow ""won."" Which is so fucked up. Then I realized the real piece of shit in that moment was **me**.    
  
Was she a piece of shit in active addiction? Yea, sort of, most active addicts are, they can't help but do shitty things. But to say that when she's working so hard to turn her life around and NOT be a piece of shit junkie was inexcusable, and I knew it would push all of her buttons. ""Junkie"" to her is what the c-word is to most women - one of those things you just do not say.   
  
She said she understands I said it because I was angry, which makes me feel even worse. No one should accept verbal abuse just because their partner is angry - I absolutely do not want that to be normalized in our relationship. We had a toxic enough dynamic during her active addiction, and we're both busting our asses to turn that around. I'm ashamed that I allowed myself to go back to that place mentally. 
  
She hasn't talked to me much in the last couple of days, but agreed to a phone call this evening to give me the opportunity to apologize. At the moment, I'm considering myself lucky to even have the chance to apologize. "
lol you're a hero for women everywhere
"I'm currently very financially stable, but when I wasn't - ""Just cut out some of the unnecessary things and you'll be able to save up enough to do 'whatever'""...as though I even had enough money to spend on anything unnecessary. There was nothing to cut when my needed bills to live were simply more than my incoming income could support."
"I'm not that broke anymore but these still annoy me when I think about it.

1) When they make assumptions about my spending. Like when I was totally broke and couldn't pay the apartment maintenance fee, my neighbors made bad remarks after seeing me get food delivery at my door. Little they knew, my brother would give me his Sodexo meal cards because he didn't use his and I had to share this piece of information with them.

2) Not allowing some self care. I have spent literally years without buying anything for myself if I didn't absolutely had to. No hanging out with friends other than taking a walk. No TV. My former work place gifted me an iPhone. I really wanted one and kept it. My relatives, who were all having a very comfortable life and funny enough had an iPhone themselves, brought it up multiple times how I should sell it. Like I didn't have right to keep ONE thing for myself that I really liked in years.

3) When people who get financial support from their parents or someone else (or have that option at least) talk like they are in as much difficult situation as you are. I don't think everyone realizes the level of anxiety when you know there is nobody who can financially support you even if you wanted to is soooo much different than ""I hang at my loving parents' nice house and go there for dinner when I can't afford food, receive expensive gifts, and they could and would easily pay off my debt if I asked them to but I'm not doing this yet."""
"&gt; There was a period of time I regularly referred to dudes who kind of ignored all my gender clues as women and they, almost without exception freak out.

Oh, holy shit, YES! I have done that to men who bulldozed over my nicer ways of indicating my gender, and they don't usually just shrug and say ""haha, no, I'm a dude."" Some of them go really *mental* about it as if you'd just called them something terrible by saying ""she"" and ""her"" to refer to them. Which says a lot about what they think of women. 

I have known some game friends who were likewise made of awesome. It's good to see, especially in communities that tend to attract their share of gamergaters (oh, WoW general chat, how much I learned from you). "

this guy objectively fucking deserved it. but i regret sinking that low.. it's not like i told him anything he didn't already know, and it just made me look every bit as crazy as he thought i was. i regret being cruel back instead of just demonstrating to him that i was better than he treated me with my actions."

Alcohol. It seems like every social occasion revolves around, or heavily features, some kind of alcohol. If there's no alcohol, people are 500% less interested in attending.

And I'd bring them inside to get comfy on an actual bed which is something they've never experienced cuz they're chickens and live outside. I guess just comfort activities. I'd give them each a bath."
"This is the one that hurts most personally at the moment. My husband and I never had a honeymoon because we couldn't afford it, couldn't get any time off, and we still won't be going anytime in the foreseeable future. We live in a city that gets a lot of tourists, and I had a silly breakdown in public the other month because just walking past them was a constant reminder of it. 

It's not that we're scraping by on pennies, it's just virtually impossible to save money, it feels like. Every time I've managed to sock away $500, life kicks you in the teeth and there went your measly fund."
"We were making cocktails at my friend's house in high school. She put the mixture in the blender and asked me to blend it, so I turned it on.

The not-so funny part was realising I'd sprayed the newly painted ceiling. (But luckily we got it off before her parents came home.) "
"""nice guy"" expectations, which mostly seem to be a young man thing

That women shouldn't use looks as a factor in attraction. Young men seem shocked and disgusted in this- which is why nice guy culture is a thing. Dudes think that being a nice person is enough to deserve sexual attraction, and are shocked to learn that a woman may pass up someone who is nice for someone who is fit or conventionally attractive. 

But its like- you can respect someone for being nice absolutely. That doesn't make you want to bang him. Those are completely different feelings. 


Also in regards to sex: that pleasuring yourself means you are pleasuring her. I didn't know sex was actually supposed to be good and fun till I was like, 24, and this is shockingly common. Lots of young men only consider pleasuring themselves and feel that is enough.  "
"It's easy to ruin a good conversation or friendship by only talking about yourself or constantly referring back to your own experiences (ie, *oh I know just how you feel, it's like when ______ happened to me!* etc). Sometimes it's necessary to put on an interested face when someone is talking about themselves, and to ask questions about them even when it's not 100% interesting. Communication goes both ways."
Thanks for the advice man sidenote are you having a stroke? 
I feel like movies have a role in this. 
"&gt;That women are somehow complex or mysterious in a way that they can't possibly fathom - it puts women on a pedestal and dehumanises them

Ugh, yes. I was reading about Catwoman this morning, first thing on the Wiki page was why creator Bob Kane picked the cat theme:

&gt;I felt that women were feline creatures and men were more like dogs. While dogs are faithful and friendly, cats are cool, detached, and unreliable. I felt much warmer with dogs around me—cats are as hard to understand as women are. Men feel more sure of themselves with a male friend than a woman. You always need to keep women at arm's length. We don't want anyone taking over our souls, and women have a habit of doing that. So there's a love-resentment thing with women. I guess women will feel that I'm being chauvinistic to speak this way, but I do feel that I've had better relationships with male friends than women. With women, once the romance is over, somehow they never remain my friends.

I found some comfort in the fact that this was in the late 30s/40s... but then realised how often I hear similar statements today.

"I see people talking about overbearing grandmothers. I wish we would have considered moving closer to one of our parents. We are 6 hours away from one set of grandparents, and 11 from the other. No aunts and uncles, no cousins. And in our circle of friends we are the only couple who has chosen not to be child free. 


We are so, so, **so** alone in this. Child free friends are still my friends but it's just impossible to hang out with them. They go to art shows that start after bedtime, brunch during nap time, group vacations to Mexico, and we only have a few hours a day to spend with our little guy so we like to use as much of it as possible. 

Some people are great at making new ""mom friends"" but I'm not. I never understood why some women push their friends into having a baby but now I get it. I still never will, but I get it.

"I've taken so many screenshots of how horrendous people are at online dating. My personal favorite was this gem from Tinder:

"It was a pretty emotionally abusive relationship on his end, lasted for 3 years, but I dumped him and finally got out and he's gone from my life. It took a long time for me to get rid of him. I found that if I pushed him away actively, he'd fight it. He would blackmail me, trail my car, showed up at my parents house. After the initial breakup, I distanced myself and made it seem like *my fault*. ""Oh I'm broken, I'm depressed, I'm just going to go live at home, poor me"". Just lies. I never told him where I moved out after I moved from our shared apartment. I put him on restricted on my Facebook so he saw none of my posts but it looked like I just stopped using Facebook to him. A couple times he wanted to meet up and talk things out as friends, ""Oh sorry I can't I'm working"". All that jazz. 

I had to make it seem like I was fading away due to my own issues, not pushing him away. Pushing away triggered his abandonment issues. That way, when he finally grew tired of my non-response, he could ""reject"" me from his life and it would not trigger his abandonment response and craziness. 

I broke up in early 2014 with him. It wasn't until early 2017 that he finally unfriended me on Facebook and stopped sending me the odd message here and there. It took years but I am so glad. A mutual friend tells me that he thinks I'm chronically depressed, living at home with my parents, and miserable. Lol.

Ok, I never said I wasn't gorgeous, I just said I'm larger than a size zero. I've also received, ""hey don't be down on yourself, you're the funniest person I've ever met,"" when another person made a comment about my size. Again, nobody said I wasn't funny, they said I was fat.

"Yep, when MMORPG's became a thing online I jumped at it all excited.

....I quit within a year after getting harassed, belittled, mocked and insulted. It became depressing for me. And when I would reach out to the companies I was with they would always argue that it was just a WORD and I should just ignore the person.

C'mon, this isn't the first time it's happened, and I've made a few more complaints in the past, this needs to be addressed. It's harrassment!

""Well if you keep making these same reports have you considered that maybe the other players aren't the problem....""

""We can switch you servers if you'd like...."" why? I have friends on THIS specific server.

Why are my requests for help less than the other player's? I'm paying just as much as they are for this service, and I'm the one being called all the derogatory names!"

"There's plenty of ways of being 'cool', the problem is when you hear ""you're such a cool girl"" or ""you're not like other girls"" what they're really saying is ""you're not feminine"", and *that* is incredibly damaging.

Um... EXCUSE ME!? Just because I know my superheroes and enjoy superhero movies does not mean I automatically don't care about hair and makeup, I spend a lot of time and money on beauty products and like... wow, way to put down a serious talent (I am not a super talented MUA, I just wish I were). "

"I was on a site where you can make up your own interview questions.  His profile was bitterness about the divorce.  His questions were things like:

How attached are you to your phone?

How do you dress in public? 

Etc

But--they were multiple choice.  And his answers provided no middle ground.  To generalize, the choices were like, 

A. I don't have a cell phone 
B. I have a phone for emergencies only and I never bring it in the bedroom 
C. My phone is literally my second heart and I will die without it. 

A. I wear conservative dress from head to toe with nothing below the chin showing 
B. I forget 
C. I completely rock my skinny jeans and tiny tank tops everywhere!! Woohoo!

There was no middle ground.  I assumed he was being humorous at first.  Since technically I fit B for the phone thing, but it does go in my bedroom for the alarm, I chose C bc I couldn't lie.  Thought it was a joke. 

It wasn't.  Instead, I was informed that each question was worth 14 points, and that I sadly didn't get a passing grade out of 100. 

I told him he set himself up to alienate everyone by only having extreme choices.  Then he blocked me on a site I didn't know had that option. 

It was sad that he obviously picked out things he hated about his ex and wasn't able to give anyone new a chance. I felt bad.  He sabotaged himself.  "
"Time.

And it isn't a ""10 hours is too many, 9 is fine"" kind of thing either.  It will vary depending on the person's responsibilities and obligations.  My husband and I spend a lot of time gaming.  It's something we both enjoy and we dedicate a fair amount of time to it.  The important thing is that it isn't get in the way of other things in life.  For example, I'm not going to blow off my brother's birthday this weekend in order to play more Terraria (even if I'm not sure which would be more fun).  Last weekend, we went to his family's for an Easter brunch, despite neither of us particularly enjoying it.  My husband is actively looking for a new job and submitted an application last night rather than spending the entire evening playing Overwatch.

It's all about balance and priorities."

"I met my wife in a cafe. She just started talking to me in a friendly way and I didn't think much of it. (I mean I could see she was conventionally beautiful, but that's it.) About half an hour into the conversation, I realised I *really*, really liked her. I realised this as I was standing in line ordering us some food. I looked back at her, and then she smiled. She has the hugest, warmest smile, it still makes me feel weak at the knees to this day. 

Apparently I got a little too google-eyed and zone out, because suddenly I was up next and the barista was like, ""Hello? Hello? Can I help you?"" I got startled and whacked over a large display of cookies. Obviously, the whole cafe was staring at me. I bent over to pick them up, and could feel almost my entire knickers showing, and I was wearing these embarrassing pink ones that had cartoon PB&amp;J jars on it with the quote ""spread the love"". That's when she came over to help, laughing the whole time, and I felt like my heart was going to leap out of my throat.

Anyway, I tried to keep cool and hide that I liked her. But she told me after we started dating that it was so obvious! "

"I was in a relationship with someone who was sexually attracted to me and claimed to love me, for 3 years. He refused to consider marrying me because I was fat. This played with my head and I ended up really needy, because I didn't believe he loved me (can you blame me?) so he broke up with me. He also gaslighted me into thinking there was something wrong with my head. Magically all my mental issues are gone now. My self-esteem is still recovering."

"I moved to the US from the UK. I fell in love with California and got a job out here. It's way more my vibe! As a child I'd lived in south east Asia, and I never got used to the English weather. Never. Not even close. I also felt very cut off from nature in London. And I grew to hate the fast pace of it, the expense, the crowds, the crappy food. 

I visited the Bay Area for work and was blown away. The first thing I loved, apart from the sun, was how good the fruit and vegetables tasted!! I guess sunlight does wonders. And Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Sprouts... wow, heaven. (They do have tiny health food markets in London. But tiny.) Plus all the hiking trails nearby, the clear unobstructed sky, the mountains in the distance, the hummingbirds. :) My company transferred me there and I was in Silicon Valley for awhile. 

I started to hate being in an office job. I met my wife in a cafe in San Jose, and we moved to West Hollywood. That was awesome for awhile but we wanted to get out of the city even more. Now we live in Ojai. It's like a dream come true. California is so wild and beautiful, and my soul feels totally at home. "

All of the workers were in on it, and we were very excited for it.  We made sure they had the best table, sent over free drinks, and generally went out of our way to make sure everything was perfect.

The time comes, and we are all watching the moment go down, full of excitement, trying not to be seen...

The fella seriously just places the ring box on the table, and says, ""yo, I got that ring you wanted.""

"Size US 22/24.   Until I was 30 only guys over 60 hit on me.  Though a very nice guy offered to set me up in an apartment as long as I didn't tell his wife.  

I have been insulted in public repeatedly for being fat, though this was in Australia, I've not had it happen here in the USA.    I've had to hunt for fashionable clothing well fitting clothing for years again only really finding it when I moved to the USA or had to be willing to pay multiple hundreds of dollars for work suits etc.  Though I hear plus sized clothing in Australia has gotten better since I left.  I only manged to find a bra that actually fit properly that didn't cost me $200 after moving to the USA. 

I lost weight down to a size US 16 for 6 months in my 20's.  Nothing changed dating wise, though I did get raped.  Took me a lot of therapy to process that I wasn't asking for it by being more attractive, that rape isn't about attraction.  As a defense I got fat again.

After I was 30 my dating life dramatically improved, I'm not sure if it was I hit the point of screw it this is me, and got a large personality to go with the large size.   I skydived, abseiled, hot air ballooned the works.  I traveled the world alone.   I had a nice amount lot of sex with some very nice men who were also in their thirties, apparently this is the age men are brave enough to like what they liked instead of worrying about what people thought of the women they were with.   That was a fun decade.  I started my own business, being bigger and a woman I had to push to be taken seriously at work &amp; in business. 

A life time of being insulted starts to make you immune to what people say about you.  I have a tendency to do what I want anyway.  Learning to tune out the haters is a skill that takes practice, the worst part is sometimes the worst hater is yourself.  That voice telling you you don't deserve what you want because you're fat.  You deserve to be insulted or not have nice clothes to have a shit job &amp; just be happy with being second fiddle in other peoples lives, because hey what do you expect with your great hair &amp; awesome personality.  Took me years to shut that fucker of a voice up, though sometimes she still leaks out.   The trick is to go screw you all of you, I am going to do this anyway.

In my late thirties met a nice guy 17 years younger than me, we were just friends for ages, then we weren't.  Even now after 8 years of marriage he finds me attractive for reasons I cannot understand, but he still gets breathless if he see's me naked when he's not expecting it.  He still wants me in all of my 280lbs of stretch marks &amp; wrinkled glory.  Good news is I want him too so it works out well. 

Edited to add

TL;DR  It sucked for a long time.  Then it didn't.   

Also apparently I have given you a biography I apologize but it seemed the only way as because how I've experienced being fat has changed as I've changed. "
"When I was young, the first guy I went on a date with said he’d “help me” with my “problem”. My virginity.  Yeah, no.  First date, last date.

Next guy was a co-worker.  A nice guy.  But not for me.  I realized that on the second date.  Others said that I “dumped his ass.”  Can you really dump someone after two dates and not even a kiss?

Third guy was also a co-worker.  When he started working, I hated him.  Wished he’d fail probation.  Get fired.  Go away.  I didn’t realize that I was in love with him because...well, what did I know about it, right?  23 years old, three dates, never been kissed.

Anyway, a year and a half later, we had a date.  Then another.  On date 4, he kissed me.  OMG!  It was fantastic!  He said that he could feel that I gave all of me in that kiss to him, then nearly passed out when I said it was my first kiss.  All he could say was, “Oh shit!  I’m in trouble!  You kiss like that and it’s your first kiss?  Oh shit!”

Yeah, well, that was March 1987.  We’ve been together since.

Back then, I was much thinner than now, but I’ve never been thin."

It's ""I want that"".

It's a thing that I used to get all the time for being fat, and now I get for being muscular, or being butch.

It's just, they want a sexy lady, eventually the realize they aren't getting sexy ladies, but ooh!  I'm right there!

There are so many dos and don'ts out there for interviews that it can feel like they're just looking for reasons to exclude you, but honestly, 99.9% of the time they are desperately hoping that the next person will be a perfect fit so they can stop having a vacancy. So just keep in mind that they're on your side.

Personality fit is a strong factor for some industries/jobs/businesses, as well, so sometimes you can have all the right qualifications and just not be the right person for this team. It's not all within your control.

That said, yes, don't be late, be polite and organized, and think up some anecdotes about your work history. Stories will stick in people's minds better than lists of skills or accomplishments."

The only reason I knew I had missed the final exam with the new date was because I passed a classmate in the hall, and she asked if I had had a family emergency that night. Immediately I panicked and ran to the lab to email my teacher. 

He was in the middle of a critique for one of his other classes so I waited outside the room to give him my final project. He seemed really disappointed in me, but I tried to explain it was a genuine mistake. Earned a C in the class, which I gladly accepted because he could've easily given me a 0 on the assignment and failed me. 

It's been almost 10 years since that royal screw up and I still wake up in a panic sometimes. "

"I ended up faking orgasms for the first two years of my first relationship. I actually didn't even know I was, because I had never had a vaginal orgasm, and I just thought ""well, of course it's more intense when I masturbate"" because I knew how to concentrate with the rhythm when I did it myself. So I thought for two years that the little tingle you get right before orgasm was the actual orgasm. Definitely exaggerated my reaction to that with unnecessary moans....

When I finally had a real one, I felt so guilty, but I never told him. I don't know if he noticed how much different my actual O face was, though..."

With the tantrum he confirmed the diagnosis. Brilliant.
"Say thank you every time someone does something for you.  Every time.

And if someone thanks you, acknowledge that."
"Uh, the alternative is generally just not doing it."
"His friends told me I deserved better in a serious way. I know this is a thing people sometimes joke about like ""oh them? You deserve so much better! Lol haha"" but I remember seeing his friends out one night that he wasn't out and they were like ""hey I hope you don't think you deserve to be treated the way he treats you. You really deserve better than that"" and I was like ""oh no he's great I promise!""

Also I should've just ended it but my ex once made plans with me and then refused to talk to me for literally a week because ""I just get like this sometimes."" Which is so understandable but he was on all sorts of social media and reading my messages. He just refused to answer me. And then he was ""better"" and texted me telling me to come over after work. "

An elaboration of your last point.....TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOUR SKIN!! Having a solid skincare routine does wonders...especially in the long term. 
"Women are used to being the ones to be approached. So, I always am the one to make the first move, since otherwise we'd both be shy at each-other forever and it'd never go anywhere. "
"Now that I'm out of my teens I've seen some teen relationships and also young married couples and it was weird to me how some men just expect their girlfriend to be emotionally abusive. (You can flip that around because women do the same thing but in my social circles I've seen it a lot this way around). 


Some young boys don't seem to realize that not only is it not okay for men to control who their partners talk to and what they do, it's not okay for women either. I've seen it so often that girls flat out allow or disallow their boyfriends from seeing friends, talking to other women, going out... Or they stalk them, demand to read their text conversations and control their social media. 

I feel like this ""I'm hot so I can be abusive but you should be grateful for me anyways"" is being normalized a bit in teen culture right now. It's finally kind of sunk in that it's not cool for your boyfriend to dictate what you're wearing but I feel like it hasn't really gotten through to boys that they need to end relationships like that too. It's not cute to call your SO 57 times because they haven't replied in five minutes or to key their car or smash their makeup or whatever, and it's sad for me when I meet guys around my age dating who expect me to act manipulative and abusive towards them because I know what that's like and until you can fix that feeling you're not going to be ready for a healthy relationship.

Nutella. It's just a sugar paste and the obsession with it is confusing. When people tell me they eat it out of the jar I think it's like eating chocolate syrup straight. 
"I remember my ex doing this! He'd rib me, and then accuse me of being sensitive when I assertively said I didn't appreciate it. The ""WHAT?! I was JUST JOKING"" got old. And he couldn't handle ever getting teased in return. "
"The last time I saw one ex I'd just lost 2 stone (through stress) and had a whole new wardrobe. I'd also got a totally new hairstyle which everyone said was flattering. I was walking down the street in my new clothes with my new body and new hairdo and he got off a bus in front of me and saw me. He looked all happy for a moment until I bent double with laughter at the appalling dye job he'd got on his hair. I didn't mean to laugh, but the dye job was so so awful. He has jet black hair which he'd tried to bleach and it had gone that terribly brassy orange colour and looked terrible. Then he skulked off and I never saw him again. If he hadn't been such an abusive arsehole, I'm sure the experience wouldn't have delighted me so much. "
"I told my abusive stalker ex who threatened me with rape, violence and forced pregnancy that I'd carve his eyes out if he didn't leave me alone, and meant it.  He actually disappeared from my life permanently after that."
"At this point, I had met my then-boyfriend's entire family. Mom, dad, and younger sister. They were all nice people, each with a bunch of extra weight on them.

One day, we were looking through his old Facebook photos when I saw a picture of his dad with a gorgeous young blonde woman with a slender, lovely figure. I can appreciate a beautiful woman, so I drooled, but I also started wondering if his dad had a secret dating life. I said, ""Wow, who's that hot blonde girl with your dad?""

He said, ""That's my sister back when she was on meth!"" I looked closer and it *was*. We were both silent and went to the next picture.

Lesson learned: Sexuality doesn't mix with family photos."
"Thank you. I think in some ways it's more annoying because so many people who use ""there are no girls on the internet"" hadn't been born yet when like, the internet became a thing. I've written similar stuff about the shitty video game boys only clubhouse also. I'm a girl. I'm here. I've always been here. *We* have always been here. Fuck off with your bullshit gatekeeping. "
"Loooooooots of insecurity. Like every single day it's a self-esteem battle. Really hard to get over being told that my worth is pre-determined by my looks, and that it's some kind of character flaw for me to be fat. That's also some depression speaking. 

Guys literally ignore me, especially when I'm around more attractive female friends. Makes it easier to filter out disgusting men. 

The one nice thing is not being targeted by the fuckboys at my part time job. The other young, cute undergrads are constantly flirted with and harassed, but I'm just left alone.

EDIT: Oh my god, I forgot my absolute fucking favorite piece of it all. I'm seen as an obstacle to get around to get to my hotter friends, too. I went to a paint rave during my undergrad, and at one point was dancing with my (cute, petite) roommate. Two guys came up close behind us, and I heard one mutter to the other one ""dibs on the hot one"" and start grinding on my roommate. Fucking. Disgusting."
"If I had a *two week* safety net I'd be happy. I have no savings whatsoever, and the only reason I've started a pension pot is because my employer automatically deducts it each month. *Any* savings to fall back on would be a luxury."

"Ex put a lot of effort into making me feel really bad and insecure about little things, whether it was movies, music, clothes, even my groceries for fucks sake! If I liked something or showed interest in something, without fail, he had a comment.

It was the little things, and it started out small. In the beginning, I brushed it off as just different tastes. But it got to a point where I would get anxious because I wanted to watch a movie or listen to my favorite band, but I couldn't, because all I could hear was his criticism. I tried forcing myself to like other things just have something to talk about that wouldn't turn into a lecture. Eventually I realized I would never be good enough for his pretentious ass, no matter how obscure or ""elite"" my tastes were.

After I ended it, the first thing I did was watch all my ""shitty Netflix"" without being judged. Felt better than the sex. :)"
"Coleslaw. I generally like salads, but I find this one to be disgusting, especially when it uses mayonnaise."
"Everyone is a shit driver except me. Someone cuts me off? They're an asshole. I cut someone off? It was an accident, people make mistakes etc"
Superhero movies. They're all the same type of storyline and action sequences.
"I slightly wish there was more emphasis on physical activity and healthy eating--or at least that we had done more together as a family. I would never put all the blame on my parents instead of myself, but if I'd grown up with more models of physical activity=fun!, I might not be quite as fat and lazy as I am now. Maybe. I don't know."
"He will react in a rage if you try to break up with him directly. Wears you down until you get back together with him. If you are docile no attention will be payed until you try to leave again  or cheat. Yes, it's abusive. "
"It's been driving me crazy recently that when you tell someone you don't want kids, all you hear is ""Why don't you want kids?"" (after the wave of ""you'll change your mind when you meet the right man"" comments of course!)
Why does no one ask ""Why DO you want kids?""
It drives me insane, to be made to feel like I have to justify NOT diving into a life changing decision, when it really should be the opposite."
"I would first take my cat to where I found him and explain how I found him and show him the other cats who are there so maybe he'd be more appreciative of me and his home because he's a spoiled bastard and get why we've taken in a new stray cat. The new one would get an etiquette lesson. (Gracefully and grandly, you fluffy orange shithead)

Then once those two hugged it out and convinced me they won't kill each other, which will be a chore, we're going to the zoo then a road trip with all my favorite stops to Baja. 

Although one is older and neurotic (think woody Allen) and the other is young gorgeous and gregarious (think John Cena, but like, angry sometimes) so... it would be an entertaining and likely antic filled trip. "

"The number of guys people match with on dating apps who lead with demands (not requests, but pure entitlement!) for nudes baffles me. If it's not being offered up, it means she's probably still figuring out whether she's interested since it's not like there's a dearth of male attention for women in the first place.

I think I find it the most baffling on Feeld - like, you don't think the girl who's open to playing unicorn doesn't have hundreds of other couples eager to have a chat with her and make sure she's comfortable before that comes up? Way to talk yourself out of the game in the first breath."
"I don't even like PIV, I just do it because I'm expected to. I love g-spot stimulation, but I like keeping pressure on it, not moving in and out (my favourite sex toy is a very curved, heavy, metal wand that I move very slightly).

I told this to my ex, and he told me there was something wrong with my vagina. Said I should get it checked out. He totally refused to spend more time using my toy on me than sticking his dick in me. 

I wish guys realised how different women's preferences are, instead of assuming that sex = PIV = therefore it must feel good. They can start with realising that sex does not equal PIV. "
"""Women hate women.""

"The hairless thing. Honestly, I feel this more of an American thing. Even though I was born here, I grew up in a culture that didn't make a big deal or any deal about this. Hell, many, many women had full blown beards and their husbands &amp; families didn't bat an eyelash.  I feel very grateful for having been exposed to real human bodies. I figure if someone has a problem with my hair, they better make pretty damn sure that they themselves shave from eyebrow to asscrack everyday to see how it feels before they try and dictate how my body should be."
"The biggest one, very early, is that he called me a ""fucking bitch"" in front of my friend because he was wrong about something. I won't go over the whole story, but basically he was insisting something with a clear factual answer that he couldn't possibly know was accurate, and my friend and I who he knew would have the factual information started laughing because we assumed he was joking.

He flipped out, started calling me names. We hadn't been together long. My friend left immediately. I went to my room. I came back out later and told him that if he ever spoke to me like that again, I would leave.

He proceeded to tell me this huge sob story about how his siblings used to laugh at him, and it hurt him so much to see it coming from the woman he loved.

This was the first crossroads. I was so hurt and so angry, but I remember thinking -- well, if I want him to be understanding of me, I need to be understanding of him. So I forgave him.

That's what abusers do: they use your best qualities (empathy, compassion, desire to be a good partner) against you. Needless to say, that was not the last time he spoke to me like that again, and much, much worse.

But that first time I let him push my absolute boundary back, I think, was the turning point. Once I'd justified allowing him to transgress one boundary, the rest started to fall more rapidly. "

"I remember years ago having an argument with a male friend about this thinking. I said I that I choose to at least trim but it's weird that guys think they're immune from at least considering it on themselves. He said something like ""well, men don't need to shave their balls because it doesn't get in your mouth like it does with us when we go down on you"" as though pubic hair respects the boundary between the root of the penis and everything else. Guess what? Pubic hair, like all hair, can fall out and end up in places it isn't necessarily welcome. Your bed is probably full of fallen out pubic hair for example. But my point is I did once pull a couple of hairs out of my teeth the morning after going down on a guy.

I'm too old and married to really care now, hair happens, smells and sweat etc happen. But young guys in particular seem to think that fresh flowers and perfume are produced by their penis and only a vagina harbours all the horrors in the known universe!"

"There was a while where after paying required bills, my fiance and I only had about $35 a week in money leftover.  That had to pay for groceries, shampoo, laundry detergent, cat food - anything that wasn't a bill.  Luckily it was only for about three months, but damn, it really taught me the importance of budgeting.  $5 would have meant we had to go hungry.  

Though if anyone else is in the same boat, please please please get food from a food bank.  Somehow I thought that since we were able to keep a roof over our heads and the lights on, we weren't needy enough for charity.  Even when I cried in the grocery store because all my fiance wanted for his birthday was some corn dogs and we just could not afford even the cheapest ones in the freezer aisle.  I was frantically trying to find something in the cart to put back but we were both already skipping meals to save money and I just couldn't do it.  

Don't do that to yourself, please."
"I got a sewing machine for exactly this reason and it's for reals the best thing I ever did for my wardrobe! I LOVE it. And just like you my clothing is basically all from thrift stores. I love love love being able to basically buy anything I want in the thrift store, as long as it fits my chest, I can alter the rest of it. My favourite is buying frumpy old lady dresses/housecoats because I like the pattern of the fabric - once I cut it to knee length, hack off the weird collars and hideous accents, and take in the waist, maybe fiddle with the neckline a bit, it's super flattering, plus they're really unique! AND those are usually the cheapest items because no one wants them.

Sorry, not super relevant to the thread but yeah. Totally do this. $15 might not be ""that much"" to some people, but it kind of is if you have to do it to literally every clothing item. And omg it's so nice to be able to just buy whatever and not be so constrained by what fits (because nothing fits.)"
"We learned to recognize the differences in how the other shows affection and now just roll with it. Also, I believe that you don't just have one language. While my husband is really big on gift giving and I'm more physical touch, he also displays affection via touch and words. I also display via words and service. There's common ground and then just understanding."
"It would bother me if it was an obviously sexual photo of someone. Everyone can see what you like, so it's just tacky.

"A lot of male/male stories written by women are very heteronormative, so they follow the ""standard"" hetero relationship template (or at least what 14 year old girls think is the ""standard"" hetero relationship template).  Sex, marriage and babies are all ways of ""leveling up"" the relationship and making the story more romantic/intense.

Male/male stories can also be a way for women to explore sexuality in a ""safe,"" depersonalized way, so you see a lot of extreme kink.  Male pregnancy stories can be a way for female readers to think about pregnancy and/or pregnancy fetishes in a way that doesn't directly affect them."

"Omg, I had a sex dream last night. Very realistic one about a...semi celebrity I guess. I very rarely have those and it was good.

I'm so brainwashed by this in real life and I know it, but it's disturbing how I can't even have a dream without worrying about hair. Hair grows on me cause I'm human and I'm SO ashamed of it."
"That we enjoy sex as easily as they do. 

I'm not saying women don't enjoy sex, but out of all my friends, (all of us in early 20's) three have had an orgasm with a male partner, and two of them are in long term relationships and have had to delicately teach their boyfriend what they like in bed. The rest of us still date and have one night stands and whatnot, just no orgasms. I cannot tell you the number of times I've heard the same story, a guy not doing enough foreplay, just kind of treating his partner like a prop once p is in the v, and then coming, rolling off, saying 'did you come?' and then not offering to help finish a lady off when it has been established that no, no one comes from shitty sex like that.

I'm talking about the studies that show that women who wear makeup are seen as more competent, prestigious, healthy, and, obviously, attractive.

But I panicked, convinced that I had no chance of passing the interview if I couldn't at least name one or two, and tried to make up some plausible-sounding department names.

"If you've never been poor, I'd highly recommend Nickel and Dimed.  It's a nonfiction book where the author attempts to live in three different cities in the US on low wages.  It all seems intuitive to me but I grew up poor - for friends who haven't been, it's been really eye opening to see all of the costs associated with being poor.  

For example, if you can't afford to pay for the deposit on an apartment, you get stuck paying high prices to live in a hotel.  Because you're paying more to live in the hotel than you would in rent, you can never save up for that deposit.  

Whereas someone who is doing okay financially, or can borrow money from parents or something, they're able to pay the deposit and get a cheaper apartment."

"What an interesting read. I think that gender matters a lot as we have individual differences and needs but for some reason it may feel taboo to talk about them for some. For example,I believe American Girl has a fantastic book series about transitioning into puberty for girls and tweens. I think the exposure is really beneficial for the younger audience. 

I recall being in an advanced anatomy course and there was snickering, nervous laughs, or squirming when we got to the reproductive section of females, males, transgender, etc. What is so funny about ovaries again? Or images on a disease such as an STD or some type of advanced cancer such as cervical cancer? It was kind of astonishing how little many of them knew in regards to female anatomy but were so quick to make comments about a woman being ""dirty"" or ""brought it upon herself"". 

Umm, no.

"Growing up we'd drive way into the northern part of Ontario, Canada to visit relatives. This was in the days before personal electronic devices, and the radio would kick out mid-way through the drive.

Every winter our mom would turn to my sister and I and give us a chance to make some money. If we saw a moose we'd get twenty five cents, but if we saw a bear we'd get $5!

Now every so often we'd spot a moose and get a quarter each, but every winter as we made our way through the snow dusted trees my sister and I would excitedly exclaim ""OH! I SAW A BEAR!""

Somehow our mother, regardless of whether she was the passenger or driver, knew we hadn't seen a bear.

A few years back I finally asked my mom how she knew my sister and I were lying about the bears and she gave me a look as if she was questioning how smart her daughter REALLY was.

""Well that's because it was winter time and bears normally are hibernating then....""

The realization hit me so hard...fuck, I'm an idiot how did I never see that? WE LEARNED ABOUT THAT IN SCHOOL!"
"A lot of people who say they prefer ""natural beauty"" or ""hate"" makeup have no idea when a lady is actually wearing makeup unless she has on lipstick. "
"I agree. I had a roommate like this that was ""gonna start working out more,"" and ""go a full month with 0 booze"" (a month before her wedding when people were eating out and buying rounds daily, in the summer which is beer-time in our city). It... failed. And she seemed to really resent that it, frankly, didn't fail for me. I quit drinking altogether and have been working out daily for awhile now, or at least a *little* something every day, even yard work or a walk, where she basically gave up. There was always a reason, too, like guests being in town (I worked out before they got up), or going out to eat (I make a restaurant meal last 2-3 days). Basically, just no willpower, and she seemed downright annoyed that I had/have follow-through. And thereby downplayed my success at every turn: ""Oh, well you're a natural morning person, so it's easier for you to wake up early."" Yes, that's true, but it also takes dedication.

Agreed. Shoes on indoors makes no sense. You'll ruin your floors that way.

I still find it incredibly uncomfortable wearing shoes indoors even when my host tells me it's all right.

"Recently had this happen with my best friend of three years. 

Videogames tend to bring out the crazy side in people for some reason. We joked and razzed one another constantly, but if I dared poke fun at something game related - it hit the fan. 

It was honestly minor things, like him activating a trip wire he didn't see. The funny part was that just a few days earlier he said ""you're an idiot and garbage at this game if you hit a tripwire"". I promptly brought that up and teased him lightly, which he got mad about. 

So instead of teasing me back about stupid things i've done in the game, he tells me: ""You know if you act this f***ing annoying with me, I can see why your previous relationships ended or they cheated. I would get sick of you too"".

He was promptly blocked, which was honestly really sad for me. He'd been a butt and made suggestive comments before, but I always let it go. He tried apologizing the next day, and I aired my feelings on the comment. He then proceeded to say he regretted what he said - but that it was true. That was a sign for sure that he wasn't truly sorry for the right reasons."
"One of my bosses suggested I convince my parents to buy me a nice wardrobe to work my minimum wage retail job.  I was a young married woman with a toddler and my parents would only finance an emergency.  I told her my parents were not going to subsidize the wages the company gave me so they could make more profit.  If they wanted me to buy a wardrobe to some standard that I currently could not buy on minimum wage, then they could finance it with a bonus or a raise.

I was a good worker.  This boss was still living with her parents.  She shut her mouth."

"I've noticed that my anxiety gets noticeably worse when I'm in an ill-fitting relationship. For example, in my last relationship if my guy and I didn't text or hang out for a while, I'd begin to question everything, like whether he was still into me or if I had done something wrong, or if I was making all of it up in my head. I'd spend time beating myself up in my mind for things out of my control and stressing and obsessing way too much about the relationship. Now I'm with a guy who makes me feel completely safe and secure, and I know that even if there's a period of time where we don't text or see each other, that our feelings haven't changed and that everything's okay. I feel mentally secure and can focus on other things when he's not around. "

It's almost as if they hate women no matter what we do

The girl was thin, blonde, and conventionally attractive while the guy was chubby and average-looking. Soooo many bitter redditors called her a gold digger or a whore despite the fact that the picture said nothing about how much money either of them made (they were at his brother's wedding I think) and neither of them looked older than 20."

When he showed his more misogynistic, obnoxious side (he actually said he'd never date anyone working in a non-profit because they're all fat) I very quickly shot that down in a way that, had he acted gracefully, would have actually allowed him to come out on top. He didn't, and now he just looks like an immature, socially inept guy who can't even do his job properly (he's constantly having my boss come in and tell him to fix the task he just did, as it's usually full of mistakes and incomplete) and lets his ego get the best of him. He's honestly intimidated by me  (""oh wow, I need to rethink how I see you in my mind. You're as good as me"" an actual thing he said when I showed him an old sketch) and has this very obnoxious way to need to prove himself without actually putting in the work.

"I guess I just realised I was a hypocrite - I said I loved animals, yet I ate them.

"My mom was the primary disciplinarian when I was a kid.  She would usually be the one who set the rules and the consequences for misbehaving.  If we would argue there was always the threat of don't make me tell your dad. 

I can think of several times where the ""don't make me tell your dad"" was used and he was in the room.  My dad would stand up saying, ""They did what"", he would start shaking like he was seconds away from being overcome with rage and just losing it.  He would keep yelling, ""THEY DID WHAT"".  My mom would look at us like she was terrified and say ""Kids go to your room, I'll deal with your Dad, just go to your room"" and we would run to take our timeouts.

It wasn't until I was well into adulthood that I ever thought about this, but my dad is mostly mild mannered and I never once saw him lose his temper.  I now think the whole thing was just a giant show where my dad would pretend to hulk out and my mom got to be the good guy who was only giving us light punishments.  We would then also take extra care to follow the rules around my dad because ""you wouldn't like em when hes angry"". 

As an adult I bet this would be a good way to get your husband involved in disciplining.  He gets to have a little fun while doing it, you seem reasonable and kind, and you both get a good laugh at the kids expense.

My chickens always bounced back from deaths pretty easily. Except my red. She lost one she'd grown up with to a dog and was never quite the same. The duck had a hard time too.

I lost so many over the years to assholes from a nearby bike trail who refused to keep their dogs on leashes (in a park where they were legally required to) and they'd leap over our 5 foot fence and tear them up. Turned me into the leash police on the trail nearby. Oh- and everyone who's dog did it- never their fault or their dog's fault. *their* dog is a *good* dog. Fantastic. Leash it.

there's something very inorganic about it that never worked for me. someone said something about it being like an interview and i agree. like there's a role opening for a person to apply to fill.

"Stuff like this is not only pervasive but also so very insidious in just how damaging it is to women and men. 

Society tells men that in order to ""manly"" they should never give up and that any notion of stopping is akin to surrender where you somehow ""lose."" The ""win"" then becomes, as you mentioned, this notion that women are rewards or prizes. 

Another part of this that I have heard from just so many young women in particular is the incredible double-bind they get caught in. If women ignore or dismiss a man's persistence then she's seen as cold and insensitive. If she entertains the persistence or even just responds to it without necessarily accepting it, then she is somehow a slut. 

But there's also this other aspect of this that is incredibly horrible and dangerous. This belief about women, men and interactions tells men (and women) two things: 1. that women either are never honest with their first reactions and 2. that women's thinking is inaccurate and cannot be trusted (even by the woman herself).

"He acted very entitled to understanding and empathy and emotional labor while not giving anything back. He couldn't encourage me, support me, compliment me or acknowledge anything that would've made me feel good about myself. He couldn't *talk* to me, but would make a big deal about ""actions meaning more than words."" Basically, what he meant was he wanted MY actions and my support, but he didn't want to listen to anything I said. It was so terrible.

It got to this point where I was hiding how depressed I was because he'd just yell at me for ""making him look bad.""

I gave him a lot of my energy, encouraging him to take control of his life, giving him pep talks.

I stayed as long as I did cuz at the time I was still in the ""love takes work"" mindset. (Terrible advice for being that age, IMO. He was also older than me and would've known better. I was so naive.)

He only wanted me in that role, to be his support. One-sided. When I left him, he told me I didn't have any empathy and that I'd ""live a short life"" without him cuz I wasn't capable of taking care of myself. Just taking for granted the resources and energy I'd spent on him.

tl;dr One-sidedness basically, the caring and demonstration of feelings wasn't mutual, I put up with so much entitlement and invalidation from him cuz I was in love"

And my neighbor is so into rescue animals she will literally leave work for a ""family emergency"" only to drive 3 hours away and rescue a dog or cat from being put down. And once I saw on the news that traffic on a very busy onramp was basically at a standstill because a ""good Samaritan"" was helping a goose or something to safety away from the road. Sure enough it was my neighbor. "
"Man, I had a boyfriend who played Warhammer and did not know how to prioritize. He got into it after we'd already been dating for 2 years or so. He started to spend literally all of his time on it. It came to a point where he never had any time for me/work/anything at all besides Warhammer. I ended up breaking up with him over it. "
"Homeopathic stuff. Yeah, Big Pharma and all, they're no saints. But it's not like homeopathy isn't also a massive, profit-driven industry based on marketing and up-selling things to you. They also have even less oversight or proven effectiveness. Natural doesn't automatically mean better. Home births sound great in theory, but at what point do we have a right to say what you're doing is ignorant and dangerous? "
"Ugh, I dated a porn addict once. I wasn't over 120 at the time and was very fit; rock climbing multiple times a week and training hard. He photoshopped a picture of me to make my waist smaller. Neeeever again. "
