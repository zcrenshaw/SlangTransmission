My own realisation how low my standards are.
Throwing a drink in someone's face. Like I'm going to waste perfectly good booze *and* get myself thrown out of the place. 
"Great. Sounds like a responsible dude, I'd totally be up for that. "
Pluck my nipple hairs. He can never know. 
"I never anticipated always having an ongoing to-do list. There's always a phone call I need to make, something I have to mail, something that needs to be cleaned. I literally haven't had a day yet where something isn't hanging over my head."

"I frequently give myself more food when I cook for us and I am not sorry.

Edit: y'all are making me sound like a monster. I don't like give myself a huge mountain of food and he gets only a spoonful or anything like that. It's more like I'll give myself an extra chicken nugget or a half scoop more than him. And I never do that when it's something he really likes or something expensive like a nice steak or something."
He knows I watch porn... but he can never know what kind of porn. I'm taking that shit to the grave
"If you are unsure on how to act try crying harder than her, forcing her into the reactionary position. This puts the ball in her court while  simultaneously establishing you as the dominant pressence."
"Running constantly over all terrain in high heels. Bra straps changing color or style every scene. 

Falling in ""love"" with someone after knowing them for less than 24 hours. "
"My first boyfriend used to lick all over my face. I was always so grossed out by it but I kept my mouth shut cause I didn't want to hurt his feelings. He also stuck his tongue like deep into my ear canal constantly which was gross. Also he had what he called an ""armpit fetish"" and would always try to lick my armpits. Also one time he goes ""can i spit in your mouth?"" But I couldn't understand him so I asked him to repeat it, but then he ignored me and just hovered over me with like a string of spit hanging from his mouth, so i ducked out of the way and he sucked it back up and said ""why did you move?"" Like jesus Christ this dude was just disgusting and poor 15 year old me had no idea what to do"
"If you send someone a text, and they don't reply, don't send them 15 more texts about their lack of reply.

Maybe like one a day later if you actually *needed* a reply and it was important."
Jumping into a pool and then hopping out to sunbathe while still rocking a full face of make up.
"I had an ex who sometimes did this *thing* with his upper lip. Have you ever seen a giraffe extend its upper lip to reach for a tasty bunch of leaves on a high branch? He used to do that to my nipples. I looked down and saw it and was just horrified -- that weird prehensile lip hovering over my left nipple -- and it just put me entirely out of the mood. 

Dude, if it's that far out of reach, move your head, not your creepy lip-beak. Ugh. Why? Whyyy would he do it? I still shudder thinking about it.

Edited to add: OMG, I forgot this same guy also once tried vibrating. His whole body, just...vibrating. While he was inside me. Because women dig vibrators, I guess? If I hadn't been so young and tender-hearted, I'd have said something, but instead I just went still and hoped he would figure out that this was Not A Thing. Points to him for trying something, I guess, but no. Noooooo. "
All panties eventually become period panties.
"Well, yea. It's the I-made-the-food-and-you-can-suck-it-or-make-it-yourself tax."
Getting on top of a dude and automatically penetration just somehow occurred without any hands guiding the way. Like what? That shit did not just slide right in without angling it so. And I know for damn sure it didn't happen with the extreme lack of foreplay that happens in movies. So confused. 
"All black people don't do and know the same things. I don't twerk, I can't rap, and I can't ""talk ghetto"" and fuck you for repeatedly asking when you know the answer is no. For the most part, they don't get how tiring and unfunny that is. Yeah they thought it was hilarious, like the other oh I don't know, 20 people that have asked me that over and over. That's why many minorities are ""touchy about harmless subjects"". Because you are not the first person asking me to do something silly and stereotypical with a shiteating grin nor will you be the last, and sometimes we're just not in the mood be asked if we like kool aid, can do kung fu, or what's under our dad's turban."
"I track his mental/phyisical health. He's bipolar so I always keep tabs on his sleeping habits, how much he's exercising, if he's keeping up with his meds, etc. I seriously doubt he's aware of how closely I watch those indicators. "
"Was sexting. He said ""Describe your cute little rectum."" I died on the inside."
"That's very uncommon where I live, but it'd definitely make me feel very comfortable and I'd think he's a responsible guy.

Buuut I'd make sure it's not only because he wants sex without a condom, since I wouldn't be up to that with a person I'm not in a relationship with."
Just finding a freaking job is the hardest thing ever and it makes me feel inadequate. 
"Life doesn't stop when you get sick. If you have something important to do, you have to do it. Getting a note doesn't work, having your mom do it doesn't work. Laundry piles up, you have to provide your own medicine and sustenance. You have to show up for work (in some/most cases.) It was such a shock from high school and even college when a clinic note could overcome pretty much anything. "
"Mail it. 

I believe the company that does so is called Potato Parcel? Anyway, for something like $9-15 they'll write a message on a potato and mail it (presumably anonymously) for you. I sent one to my mom for her birthday - she works for a major greeting card company and thus does not enjoy receiving cards for occasions. 

So the potato said, ""happy birthday, mom. I know you hate cards."" 

She called me and at first I thought there was something wrong, because she couldn't talk and was crying from laughing so hard. It was money well spent. "
"He tried going down on me, but didn't go down far enough... He ate out my bellybutton. "
"When I say my hair is tangled it is not the same as their hair being tangled. Detangling straight hair or wavy hair is not similar to detangling a 4c afro.

Additionally they can't seem to understand why I take offense to men who hit on me because of my race. For example ""you're pretty for a black girl"" or ""I've never been with a black girl before"". My white friends will rarely experience being fetishized because they are white. "
"Only wearing sexy lingerie. In real life, they'd turn into period panties."
Gangbangs. I don't want my boyfriend to feel like he isn't enough. 
"Yes, this so much. In real life, slapping people is abusive. In the movies, it's seen as a legitimate communication device. "
"When I'm angry, it's not because I'm and angry black woman. The one time I get extremely angry and get loud cancels out all the times I was angry and was very calm."
"Jesus christ. They would all be passing around a blunt talking about which craft beer is best and circlejerking about why even try to get a job when American corporations are all shit and ""half my money goes to taxes"". This is why I reddit at 9 am. To get punched in the face with a lifetimes worth of cringey relationship choices. And realize that now isn't the lowest I've been. Thanks."
"The nervousness people have in acknowledging race in front of a black person. I can't count of how many times I've asked a white person to describe someone to me and seen that far off look in their eyes as they try to avoid saying the word ""black."" As if it's an insult. Just say it. 

Or they'll whisper it. Liberals. Friends of the common man. I walk around every day of my life being black, *you're* the one who has an issue with it, so why whisper it around *me.*"
"If you're having conversations that you wouldn't tell your SO you're having with this person, I think that's a pretty clear line."

"Turned 61 yesterday.  It's arctic blond (wink... grey) and [just past my shoulders]  (http://i.imgur.com/QX9xEjc.jpg).

ETA:  Thank you for so many lovely comments!  And wrt questions about my kitchen... which was a reno I did last May for my 60th... here's [another photo](http://i.imgur.com/GcgVNbM.jpg) and also [this angle](http://i.imgur.com/2yvRpWO.jpg).

"Definitely wearing inappropriate shoes for the situation. I was watching the season five finale of Buffy The Vampire Slayer last night and this popped into my head. Girlfriend was wearing these kitten-heel boots to fight a hell god. If she had worn sneakers, then maybe we could have avoided some of season six. Just saying."
Man this room is so empty. 
"Anyone else do ""the giraffe lip"" as you read the description?"
"Maybe it's because movies tend to have hot women. But as an average looking person, guys in real life don't immediately fall in line to get with you if you sit by yourself in a bar or are outgoing and give them attention. Movies make it seem like any woman anywhere can have sex with any guy if she's just willing, as a vagina-owner. I think guys have more scruples than that."
Having sex under the sheets. Like fully under. No fucking way. You're gonna suffocate.
"If you keep calling your 9 year old daughter fat on a family cruise where she's supposed to be having fun, then legally speaking you took that drink and tossed it in your own face."
"I take care of his dog more than he thinks. I clean the little guy's eyes and face, brush him, clean his bowls, give him fresh water, and give him coconut oil for his dry skin.

I've never had a dog before, so it's actually nice to play ""mom"" for the little nipper. :)"

"And conversely, 

I can twerk. I like rap. I do code switch aka ""talk ghetto"". I'm an amazing dancer. If I think something is super funny, I will laugh very loudly.

I'm also an avid reader, I love Neil Young, love watching speed runs of Super Metroid, I collect comic books, I'm horrible at sports and my singing voice is atrocious.

Just because I fit some of the stereotypes doesn't mean I'm not still an individual, nor does it mean they ALL apply.  People need to understand that attributing black stereotypes to inferiority or lack of intelligence/humanity is racism at its core.

Even if I blast rap in my car, we can still be best friends. We don't have to like 100% of the same things to be friends."

"As a bipolar person, this is such a great thing and so supportive. It really makes a difference, because sometimes you don't notice the warning signs yourself. "

"Seriously. One of my guy friends fucked up a date before he even went on it by texting my friend NOVELS and then when she didn't answer (because she was overwhelmed and didn't know what to say), texted her MORE NOVELS berating her for not answering. They did not go on any dates."

"I told my ex that I liked being dominated during sex and he started choking me - like, not in a sexy way, just in a painful way that was like crushing my windpipe - and he'd grunt and grit his teeth and bulge his eyes out in a way that made him look like a cartoon villain. 

EDIT: Oh yeah, I just remembered once we were talking on Facebook and I mentioned offhandedly that my feet were cold, and he said, ""I bet your toes would warm up quickly if I put my hands around your throat"". He'd randomly say weird shit like that and think it was sexy. "
"One of them and her ""you gonna burn in hell"" bullshit. You are burning with me girl, I did not have all that sex by myself. "
"In my opinion (and this applies to women too):

* Offer them a tissue.
* If you know them well enough, sit beside them and maybe put an arm around them. 
* When they're done crying, offer help, a listening ear or to forget that it ever happened. "
"°sigh° the knives. And the whiskey.

Some of them were chefs. Some were bartenders. A couple make knives. And the rest are enthusiastic and adventurous, but clumsy. And they're none of them sensible enough to think, ""maybe i should play with the knives first, *then* drink the whiskey.""

Gonna be a long night in the emergency room. "
"Have you heard the song ""Lips of an Angel"" by Hinder? (If so, I'm sorry, it's a terrible song.) But it does provide a good example of an emotional affair. 

My personal line is when your interactions with this other person become a.) romantically or sexually charged and b.) you hide these interactions from your partner. Hiding, here, means you feel as though you SHOULD tell them, or it would be a big deal/something they wouldn't like, and you specifically keep it a secret. So, basically, a combination of an inappropriate bond and sneaking around about it. "
Nice try husband. 
"Maybe this is just me, but match the level of grammar and sentence format as the person you're texting. If the person I'm talking to uses emoticons and no punctuation, I'm probs gonna match that :) If they are using complete sentences and periods, that's how I'll respond. "
"I guess I don't totally find this weird, but I didn't fully realize how much work it is to really take care of yourself. I've always been a pretty healthy person (eating well, working out, adequate sleep, self care - walking, meditation, etc.) but it's one thing when you're doing it in high school and college. Once you get into the real world, are working 60+ hour work weeks, juggling relationships, personal obligations, paying bills, etc., it is *WORK* to keep it all together. Basically, if I decide I'm going ""out out"" one night, I need to plan days in advance and fully expect that it will take about a week to feel 100% again. 

Also, as a woman, if I need to shave my GD legs, pits, or vag, shove a tampon in me, cut my nails, get my brows threaded, make sure my nails look half decent, all in the same day...I'm angry. #endrant :)"
"When he was moving in I opened up a drawer of one of his plastic bins and found a bag full of pictures so I looked through all of them. It was just pictures of his childhood and teen years... That doesn't sound bad but I'm pretty dedicated to the ""NO SNOOPING"" idea and think it's an invasion of privacy. I felt so guilty about it. 

So then later I said I saw pictures in the drawer and asked if I could look through them. He said yes and I looked through them again."
'You're pretty for a ____' is pretty insulting no matter what adjective they use.

That it doesn't mean you suddenly know how to do adult stuff. 
Hmmm probably the towel dance guy. I went over to his house for our first date (red flag one?) he had me sitting in his room while he finished doing his hair. I was skeeved out knowing his mom was just outside the door while he kept talking about how sexy I was. I kinda phased out and he asked me if I wanted to see the towel dance.... I think I nodded since I had no clue what it was he stepped outside the door and told me to close my eyes. When he told me to open them he was standing in front of me with his pants at his ankles and a dish towel hanging off his dick. He'd twitch it and kind of flick the towel around? I'm sure I turned 37 shades of red before I started laughing my ass off. This was sooo beyond my experience. I was an 18 year old virgin and my first dick was a dancing one...
Probably the stuff I do at work. I don't do anything inappropriate really but I'm a bit bolder with my jokes. It's a kitchen so weird stuff gets said. 
"This is an idea that is rampant on Reddit, as well. I constantly see comments implying that women *never* have to try to get a date/partner, that they can just click their fingers and have men lining up to sleep with them. I saw one earlier today in one of the dating app related subs where someone was giving advice on how to get more matches, and someone replied 'or just be a woman, that's a guaranteed way to get 100% success rate.' 
Just, what? Really?? I think in these fantastical situations only model-attractive women exist. Average women don't even factor. "

"Probably gonna get flack for this, but...

Having sex when you don't really feel in the mood. I'm not saying to never turn down your partner and lie about being ""in the mood"" and fake it often, but sometimes the relationship benefits from it. Haven't had sex in a week? Your partner has been crazy mad stressed at work or school? Been fighting a lot lately? Sex has a lot of power to improve the status quo, so forcing sex every once in a while can work wonders to bring change to a relationship dynamic when timed right. "
"I like to say ""do you smell smoke?"" Because it makes people take a deep inhale mwahahaha"
"Oh my gosh, I'm the opposite. My parents were the ""if you're not imminently dying, you're not sick"" people.

"I thought that I would naturally get better-looking when I got older, because everyone kept telling me I would ""grow out of"" things like acne and awkwardness. I waited for a while and eventually I just looked a bunch of stuff up on the internet and tried it to see if it helped. It did. It turns out you have to actively participate in making your appearance adultlike. Hmm."
"I think many white people are socially conditioned to avoid mentioning a person's race.  Often other white people will say, ""why do you have to mention that?"" or ""what does it matter what race he/she is?""  Sometimes it *is* inappropriate to mention someone's race, because in certain contexts it may seem like you are implying something about that race, but I would agree that describing what a person looks like so that someone knows who you are referring to is not one those times.

It's kind of like how many white people feel the need to say to black people, ""of course, that's a minor problem, compared to what you have to deal with as a black person,"" which, to me, seems condescending, and if someone said it to me, I would think they were inadvertently distancing themselves even further from me when they were trying to act like they understood me.

edit: ""those times"" instead of ""them"""

"I write him cards I never send. I send him cards as well, every once in a while, but I've written way more. I just don't want to bombard him with them because I sometimes notice them lying around in his room so I think he's actually keeping them. He never sends cards because it's not his thing, so I don't want to drown him in them. I have a whole stack of written cards and sometimes I pull one out to send him."

"Boob armor. Armor that is shaped for the breasts can actually make things for dangerous for the woman wearing it. The curvature of the plate for the breasts can redirect/guide a blade or arrow to the center of the chest. Also, if the wearer were to get hit in the chest, the part of the plate at the cleavage would push on the sternum.

This also goes for bikini armor. I can't think of any movies, though; this is probably more of a video game thing. I'm talking to you, bikini transmog tanks."

The style varies because I keep it so short I can change it up a lot without really committing, and I'm really lazy so I'll go a long time between cuts and call it a style.

"The worst date I ever had was my first tinder/blind date! 

I said hello with inside joke we shared via text. He didn't pick up on it. Awkward, but okay, we began our wandering coffee date.

Within five minutes he drops in a half-joking request to ""Netflix and Chill."" I don't mind jokes but this was said in the creepiest way ever. 

For the following two hours he won't stop talking about himself. Chalked this up to nerves so I give him benefit of the doubt. That is, until he states the following about himself:

(a) That he's the son of a millionaire. 
(b) He's an Ivy-league drop out.
(c) He's a former model.

With him being so engrossed about himself, I barely got in a word. Towards the end of the date I actually gave him an ""in a nutshell"" summary about myself since he never gave me a chance. 

Talks of my history was met with a sarcastic ""that's very humble of you."" Oh really? Sorry for coming across as a show-off, my dear million-dollar-drop-out. 

What really did it for me was when he came across one of his friends on the street. His friend greeted him and asked when they could hang out.

""Well, I'll be done with *this* in thirty minutes.""

REALLY? Nah, bro, you're done with this date now.  "
"He rarely gets stressed out. It's great because I tend to get overly stressed out. He can usually calm me down when I'm worried about something.

However, because of his super laid back nature, he sometimes won't act with a sense of urgency when things are really important or on a strict time frame. That gets frustrating."

"Not mine, but a friend's. I personally think it's hilarious.

Met a guy online and started messaging; after a week or so they agreed to meet for coffee.  She gets a text from her date saying he's going to be a few minutes late; could she do him a favour and get him a mug of hot water? She agrees; is a little confused, but gets some hot water and sits back down. Guy arrives, thanks her for getting the water then reaches into his pocket and pulls out HIS OWN TEA BAG. He looks at her and says ""I hate paying for tea in places like this! They totally over charge, so I bring my own."" 

Friend looks at the menu and sees that a tea is $1.25...Yup, guy was too cheap to spend a dollar freakin' twenty-five on tea. Not only that, he made her get his hot water. He also called her foolish and frivolous for spending money on ""fancy coffee.""

Friend left, and the guy messaged her for several weeks wanting to know why. I think the entire date lasted a total of 5 minutes. "

"For me it's definitely the hair. No one understands it until they do. Short background: I did a semester abroad with lots of Australians and Asians from the entirety of the Asian continent (honestly, I didn't know what Kazakhs looked like, now I just wanna stalk this girl)  

Anyway, all the time my abroad mates would comment on mine or the other black girls' hair. They always seemed confused when I'd take out my braids and Wear it in a fro or a twist out. Lord forbid I wear a wig! 

But this experience was eye opening for me too. I came to realise that black womens hair has been so hidden (even from ourselves. I mean, the natural hair movement is just starting to take hold in the motherland) so I don't expect non Africans to really understand my coils. 

Cute story time: this Zimbabwean and Chinese Malay girl were roommates and bffs for their 3 years of college. She was surprisingly unphased when I was explaining my braids to a bunch of frenchie exchange kids. Turns out the zim girl made *Lo* help her with her hair any and every time help was called for. She's the only Asian I know who can point out girls wearing weaves or the difference between my coils and say an Ethiopians.

She just found it fun to sneak a game session in while I was in the shower each night like when she used to hide her gaming from her parents. Btw, we are over 40 years old. I hope I didn't ruin her fun by finding it! "

"That high school never really ends.  I worked in an office setting and listened to grown adults gossip and bicker about each other.  Constantly.  The lunchroom was still a battleground for people that weren't automatically accepted into a clique.  If you weren't, you knew what people thought about you based on the treatment from management.  Because they were just as gossipy as the peons.  

I chose to be a neutral party but sometimes that makes it worse.  Because rather than being on nobody's side, people sometimes see it as being on everyone's side.  Thus confiding in me all the things I don't want to hear.  High school never. fucking. ends. "
"One of them is dead, so, um, the smell. :/"
"I also do and I think my boyfriend would be confused by that because I'm straight, and maybe wonder if he's not enough.

Honestly, I think it's mostly because in lesbian porn, in my experience, it doesn't seem like anyone is being degraded or is really uncomfortable.

I know there's non-lesbian porn out there that can also provide that but I find it's more of a mixed bag. Sometimes you don't know what you're going to get and I really don't want to be confronted by something triggering when I'm just trying to have a good time."

Same.  Every ex I've ever had (all 3 of them).  And my husband's one ex girlfriend.  Also one ex best friend who thought she was God's gift to humanity and told me to fuck off and get fatter.  It's a sick kind of satisfaction knowing I'm doing better than she is 5 years later.

"This was by far the most terrifying/hilarious date I had ever been on.
Years ago, when I was a junior in high school. He was in college. We had been texting casually for a few weeks. One weekend, he met my friend and I at a local concert. When it was over, the friend I got a ride from had to leave urgently. He offered to drive me home. 
No big deal I guess, I needed a ride. 
We went to dinner and it was very nice. Nothing weird nothing suspicious. 

Then the ride home...
My house was about 45 minutes away through isolated freeways in the desert. 
(Accepting a ride was not my proudest moment, I admit) 
He talked the entire ride and it went from normal small talk to him saying that he has super powers....
He said that when he was in high school he went to an alternate dimension and couldn't find his way back. The only way for him to find his way was to sell his soul to a merchant he found in this other dimension.
When he got back to this dimension he had super powers and could control people's emotions. He then creepily leaned over and said ""I can make you feel anything right now..."" 
He also said he knew the four horsemen of the apocalypse and that he was going to help me during the end of the world. 
At this point I was convinced I was going to end up in a garbage bag on the side of the road. 
Got home safe. Never talked to him again until he was my server at a restaurant years later and was extremely awkward. "

Why are you buying pants that are too short and already have holes in them?? 

I have strong opinions about these issues."
"I was 16, working for the first time in my life and it was working for 8 hours standing up. I noticed smokers got more breaks to smoke cigarettes, I guess because supervisors were smoking themselves. I started to smoke thinking ""I will smoke just for this summer and quit when I'm done with work."" It became an addiction that lasted more than a decade."
"That he plays lots of video games. My ex-boyfriends all played lots of video games and it caused horrible problems in our relationship. 

Turns out...it wasn't the video games causing the problem. It was their inability to strike a balance and prioritize. Yeah, my boyfriend plays *a lot* of video games, but he does it *after* he comes home from his 9-5 job, pays his bills, loads the dishwasher, does his laundry, and cleans up his mess. And he *never* starts an hour long game with friends when he knows dinner is 20 minutes out. Plus, the upside is that I have lots of quiet time to myself to do what makes me happy. And being a hardcore introvert, that is a necessity for my sanity."
"Let's not forget ""can you swim"" ""you speak so well *for a black person*/you articulate very well!"" ""what does (slang word) mean"" and the assumption ""don't worry, (the token black person) will stand up for us as a group if (the risky thing we're doing) goes wrong."" "
"I've never had that happen before and so I'm not sure how I'd react. I don't mind getting tested, but going to a clinic together would be a bit strange since 1) my doctor can run tests just fine and 2) results don't come in for 1-2 weeks anyway, so it's not like going together ensures honesty or anything.

Either way, we're still using condoms. Tests can't guarantee he doesn't have herpes or HPV and I'm not about that life."
It's amazing how the sheets always stay perfectly in place. I've never had sex but I imagine trying to keep the sheets on would be like trying to wear a hat in a hurricane. 
"That's a fantastic question, I guess their ample bosoms were too vague."
"I don't think my white friends in general understand the feeling of ""otherness"" that comes from being black (or a minority). 

I think a lot of black people subconsciously do the ""scan"" to see how many other black people there are when they walk into a room.  I don't think white people know what that feels like very often because they are constantly surrounded by their own kind. "
"Adding to this, No I'm not a delicious chocolate sundae and I don't want to be called dark chocolate Wtf?"
Hahhaha you make me feel better about life
"&gt; how women not wearing panties under a skimpy dress in movies is supposed to be super hot, but in real life I would be so uncomfortable and walking would be hard

Well, I don't wear panties under skimpy dresses because I don't want the panty line (not for sex appeal). It's pretty comfy. I actually go commando from time to time with certain styles of clothing. But that's just my experience.

To answer though, not peeing after sex. Never seen any woman do this on screen. "

"I've got more than a few first date horror stories, but one of my favorites (and I use that term loosely) was a tinder date I went on. So I matched with this dude, he seemed nice, and we agree to meet up at a coffee shop. Talking is awkward but he's giving me some neckbeardy vibes. Example: I complimented his American traditional style tattoo and his response was ""Huh I didn't think girls would know anything about tattoos"". Note that this was after me talking about the tattoos I have. But whatever. It's cool. He also tried to forcefully order for me and I just kinda was like ""lol no"", but I just figured whatever, he's nervous trying to show out or some shit. Everything is still going ok until he walks me to my car. We hug, and he leans in for a kiss, I'm like whatever I don't care, that's fine, we're making out a little and I feel his hand moving up to my face, and I think ""Oh, ok, he's just gonna put his hand on the back of my neck or my chin or in my hair or whatever"" NOPE. I WAS WRONG. SO WRONG. This motherfucker decides it's a swell idea to start choking me. At this point is would be pertinent to mention I'm a 5'8"" female of average size, and he's a 6'2""+ stocky dude. I freeze, because that's my response to threatening situations, and he leans over and whispers in my ear ""Yeah, you like that? You like being daddy's little slut"" and I'm just sitting there waiting for him to let go of my neck, because I am pinned against the car. I finally manage to stammer out a ""Wuh-what"" and he proceeds to tighten his grip and repeat the question, to which my survival instincts are screaming SAY WHAT YOU NEED TO so I just manage to choke out ""yes sir"" and he lets me go. I proceed to get the fuck out of there and chew him out after the fact. 

TL;DR rando tinder date chokes me"
"I agree. If I straight up don't want to have sex, I won't, but if I'm just feeling ""meh"" and my partner wants to? Yeah, alright. 80% of the time I end up getting into it, and the 20% of the time where I am just not very into it is still alright. I find that with my sex drive, if I don't have sex often I don't want sex very much. Sometimes I have to kick start it. I will initiate sex just because it's been a while and I know my libido will get worse if I don't do something about it. "

"Calling a woman's problems with/about her father ""daddy issues."" It's belittling someone's bad experiences and when used as an umbrella term (and a lot of people do it) some of the things you belittle are extremely traumatic experiences.

"I force myself to turn my moping into a self-care session, by which I mean I force myself to find ways to make things a little ""special"". Generally what gets me through is distracting myself with a movie on the computer, but if I'm feeling really bad, I'll cast that shit on the TV. I'll lay out blankets on the floor and pile up my pillows. I'll make cocoa or some other nice drink that I don't have regularly. Maybe make some popcorn. Pull out some nail polish if I feel like I really need to distract myself with multi-tasking. Old-fashioned ceramic Christmas lights make me inexplicably very happy, so sometimes I pull those out of the closet, lay them all around me on the floor, and turn those on and the ceiling light off to watch the movie. The lights are kind of my ace in the hole, haha.

"This one is actually funny ""bad"" as opposed to awful ""bad"".

I was on the first official date with a now-ex, and we were seeing Batman Begins. Less than 20 minutes into the movie, he gets a call from a neighbor: **the cows have escaped.**

He lives in a rural exurb, and though he lives in an apartment building, his parents live a few miles away on a 40-acre piece of land. They don't own cows, per se, but they *board* other people's cows for a side income. They're out of town for the weekend, so it was my ex's job to feed and water the cows every morning and evening. And it turns out that he hadn't closed the gate all the way after the evening feeding (completed before meeting me at the theater) and the cows took advantage.

So my ex had to bail and try to go round up the cows. I thought this was hilarious and offered to assist. So there we were, out in the middle of nowhere, trying to spot cows in the dark in people's corn fields and pastures. After a couple hours, we gave up because they were obviously not nearby and we couldn't see a thing. The cows were rounded up without incident in the morning. "

When I declined, she punched out the screen door and then ran into the middle of the street and laid there. Her sister ran out of the house and chased after her. 

I quietly got in my car and noped out of there. "

"Hanging around our bedrooms with our friends in our bras and underwear or casually changing in front of each other. I'm no prude and sure my friends and I used to occasionally get ready to go out together, but I can't imagine us just lounging around in our bras and chit chatting. Same thing with locker rooms at the gym. "

"It depends the reason for crying. When my grandmother passed I would have been heartbroken if my bf just left me alone,  he just spooned me and didn't say a thing which is what I needed. 

But if I'm crying because I'm angry I'd prefer to be left alone and it pisses me off more if I'm asked what's wrong"
I feel like part of that is the need to just feel wanted beyond reason. Like the dude just needs to have you right now. That's a turn on.
"As /u/MuchWittering said, it varies. Personally, I wouldn't be able to go panty-less because of the amount I get. My underwear act as certified discharge catchers."
"I said white women feminism.

It's basically white women, fighting for other white women. And behaving like it's for all women. 

Even here in /r/askwomen it happens a lot.

Especially when a Black woman states how she doesn't feel included and dismissed from white feminism.

She is downvoted, discounted and shamed. Because obviously a white woman would know better, /s


That's why I rarely comment. "
"A friend of mine was casually seeing a guy who had moved here from Canada. She admitted she had to shut it down after he put Vegemite on the end of his penis for her to lick off ""because Aussie girls love that stuff, right?"".
Vegemite, yes. Vegemite dick lollipop, no."
"Asked to see my favourite ring, shoved it down his pants, did a little dance and said ""want it back?""

"Many have long been rejected and/or bullied by their female peers, usually for not being feminine enough (thus making them not relatable, ""different"", ""other""), and are insecure about it. They cover up that insecurity by ""gloating"" about not having female friends. A sort of ""I'll reject them before they reject me"".

I know this isn't going to be a popular answer, but this is my experience from knowing people like this.

"As an anxious/depressed person, I was thinking the same thing. I totally rely on my SO to tell me if I'm acting a bit wacky."

"Geek culture is such an awkward white boys club. I just don't understand what the point of all the gatekeeping is, be it toward women or minorities or just people in general. More people liking whatever geeky shit you're into doesn't mean you'll get less, it likely means you'll get more as more people are pouring money into it. Be happy you've met another person who's into the same stuff you are. The whole attitude really bothers me."

"That scene in Kingsman where a woman says if the main character saves her, they'll have anal sex. And it's implied that it happens like 30 minutes later. However, there is NO WAY there was any prepping so that would've been the most painful sex ever.  "
"Hey babe, can you wax your titty beard?"
Seriously! It's funny but little cues like that from movies made me feel like I was a defective member of my gender or something for not having seductress magic powers. 
Not go to the bathroom ever. We would die or leave a mess everywhere.
"I get the sentiment behind that - but in my experience, sharing my porn tastes with my SO has enhanced our sex life.

Or when I invited a classmate to zumba (she was wondering about our campus's gym and group fitness classes) and she called it juvenile and boring (after I told her I hope to teach dance fitness one day for fun). Or when my friend felt the need to mock the WWII cosplayers in the park - they're outside, getting exercise, sharing a hobby... that's awesome, not dumb! 

If someone is enjoying something (that's not, you know, killing puppies or something), what does it matter?! Instead of squashing down what others enjoy, either remain neutral or be nice about it. "
"Similarly, don't start a text conversation and then don't respond/participate. "

"This angers me so much when I see this in tv/movies, especially when it's in comedies. I just don't see how slapping a man is funny. "
"I wish guys had more freedom to dress creatively like girls do. I feel like as a guy you're only allowed to deviate from ""t-shirt and jeans"" by a certain amount before you're dubbed a weirdo, whereas women have a lot more freedom. And don't get me wrong, nicely fitting jeans and a shirt looks good, but other things can look good too. 

I don't really care what guys wear if I'm not dating them, so I don't really have any gripes about particular fashions. But it'd be nice if more men took an interest in fashion in general and made an effort with their style."
"It's not the weirdest thing that can be in your ear canal.

My youngest sister when she was really little tried to pierce her own ear, and just stuck an earring through the inside of her ear.

Also, another effect I've found it has on me is that after a normal breakup it is especially difficult to watch the person you've left being with another girl/guy. It just brings out that sense of betrayal again. Don't know why though"

"I was in my late 20's and went to Newark (from Manhattan) to meet a guy for drinks.  He was running late, so told me the bus to get on to meet him.  

Took the bus.  Walked into the bar.  DEFINITELY did not fit in.  Drank 3 cranberry vodkas, realized I was getting stood up and left to go home.

Stood at the bus stop waiting for the bus.  Keep in mind, I'm still in Newark.  A car pulls up with 2 guys, they tell me I'm beautiful and ask me if I want a ride.  i ask them if they are heading towards Newark Penn Station.  They tell me they are and I.. GET IN THEIR CAR.

They drove me straight to Newark Penn Station and dropped me off.  And I am one unbelievably stupid and lucky female.  "
"[I have a lab made ruby with Canadian mined diamond accents.](http://i.imgur.com/GzUuhID.jpg)

Its a pretty traditional design, but I still get lots of looks for not having a diamond. Most of my friends agree that it is very ""me
"" though. 

My SO and I wanted a man made stone. I looked at a lot of moissanites, which I think are awesome, but really fell in love with lab made rubies and their flawless color. My SO and I don't really see the value in owning something that is mined out of the earth versus made in a lab.

I would be a little worried about not being able to re-size, or having stones or inlay that are a softer material, unless you're okay with the idea of  having to buy a new ring in the future. A close friend of mine has had to resize her ring twice because of weight fluctuations. It really depends on you and your priorities. Personally, I like the idea of having a ring that I will wear for the rest of my life, which is why I went for harder stones and an easily re-sizable design.

"People at my place of work have been sent home for that. Rule 1 of the office: I should not know the color of your panties or the color on the cups of your bra. Straps happen. Cups? No. Sorry. No. 

One woman came in with torn jeans with shreds all the way  up to her crotch and her shirt ripped all the way down the back.

She's a social worker, ffs. She so got sent home... it's like, go to a bank. Dress like the people who work there. "
"Ok, people seem to be commenting about how you can totally do this, so I'm going to go ahead and agree with you instead. Is it possible to do it? Yes. Is it comfortable? Not in my experience.

The times I've tried it I've either been so worried about being dropped or uncomfortable from the awkward angle that it wasn't enjoyable for me. To each their own, I know, but there are *way* better positions, IMO, and ones that lend themselves to the ""ultra-passionate spontaneous sex"" trope."
"Well I don't care about them in the social context as ""inappropriate"" but if I'm rocking a gorgeous dress, I don't want the silhouette and design of it to be interrupted by ridges of my underwear. I want the dress to look smooth and seamless."

"Why do people do this shit? Seriously? Not only is it rude, but it's tacky. Let's just pretend for a minute it isn't racist. Take that out of the equation and it's still dumb as shit and completely unnecessary. It's like meeting someone with a name from a song literally every one knows and thinking it's funny to sing it to them. 

You think someone named Eileen hasn't heard ""Come on Eileen!"" literally a million times? Do you think you're clever for asking the plumber if he's having a ""crappy"" day? Why even fucking bother asking a tall person ""how's the weather up there?"" when you know, you fucking KNOW, that it is the most obvious, over used and boring canned line in human existence? Why? Seriously. 

Do you need to let people know what you're an unoriginal and shallow idiot? No one else has stated today yet that the sky is blue and the grass is green but you need to remind people that's what they look like just in case they made it their whole lives without hearing it? But you don't give a shit that the sky is grey today or the grass is brown. You've seen that the grass is green some days and you used the green crayon to color it in when you were a kid and you saw green grass on TV shows and on the news, so since you have a lawn it must be green. ""No seriously, I know your grass is green, you're just trying to cover it up with snow. You don't need to hide your lawn from me, I know it's green! Why are you so defensive? I guess the grass is greener on the other side! HA HA HA HA GET IT? Because I'm an asshole who can only interact with the world through the narrow scope of my limited life experience that is inhibited by my inability to understand complex ideas or contribute anything interesting to a conversation so I mindlessly parrot phrases that I've heard enough that I think it will make me relevant"""

"lol no it was stuff like ""I'm lying in bed wishing you were here, I MISS YOU"" etc.  They hadn't seen or spoken to each other in years (they weren't even really friends, they hung out maybe once or twice with ME because I'm their connection to each other), they set up a date because he was moving to her city in a month so she thought his level of interest in her was super weird. She's also the type to not like texting dudes very much until they go on their first date (she's a veteran internet dater) so for him to be texting all of this super romantic stuff right off the bat without even really KNOWING her made her super uneasy.

After all of this, I found out that this is his MO with chicks he's trying to date from another mutual friend. He scares them off and then gets mad at them when they're like ""you need to chill out."" He told my friend that what she did (not answering his texts) was the WORST thing a woman has ever done to him."
"To me this is something for 6 months into a committed monogramous relationship, and then the condom discard comes into play."
"Time and effort. Had a bad year last year together. Seriously it was a full year of being miserable with each other. I'm not sure why we stayed together but Christmas is our anniversary and around that time of year I always get that feeling of ""it's time to restart"". 

So I asked him to restart with me. We don't pretend that the things that happened didn't happen but we've moved on from them. It didn't happen over night but the past few months have been really great. I feel closer to him than ever."
"Sleeping with makeup on and waking up as beautiful as they slept. No way! I have done it once and when I woke up, I looked like a vampire panda! Smeared goo and blotchy powder all over my face... It was so traumatizing I never forgot taking my makeup off again!"
"Those aren't generic. Those are things people do and like. The point of a profile isn't to be creative, it's to be honest. I could be creative and say that I enjoy unicorn ranching, but it wouldn't be true or useful. These aren't Dungeons and Dragons character sheets, these are real people, so their profiles will tend to be limited to what real people do. 

As for me, the only thing I hate seeing on profiles is self pity (""girls don't like nice guys, wah!"") and sexist complaints about whatever gender they're attracted to.

And I love the small 'notes' he leaves me by changing my whatsapp icon into a minion or putting a tiny chocolate in the middle of his room for me to come home to. So I'm pretty sure he does.

"On paper, he and I were a perfect match - have lots in common, similar personalities, etc. It was a setup from a former co-worker and it seemed promising. We met and... nothing. It was like that scene in 'When Harry Met Sally' with the setup where literally everything he said was not clicking with me, and vice versa. Awkward! The first date was our last and that's a very good thing

It ends well, though! I set him up with another friend (we kept in touch - same professional circles and he's a lovely human, just not a good match for me) and... they're now married and have 2 kids!"

"Since everyone has covered hair and not being a monolith- dating. Dating as a black woman is so hard. Others mentioned the ""you're so pretty for a black girl"" and how people treat us like a fetish, but there's definitely the feeling of being unwanted. We're everyone's last pick. Men of color drool over white women. It hurts a lot to not be wanted or desired by a large portion of the dating pool. Just like on my job applications, I never identify myself as black on dating sites because men will choose to filter me out."

He looks like a pooping baby. I let him do it because it's so funny. "

"*All the time* I get ""Wow, you're in engineering?! You don't look like what I expect a female mechanical engineer to look like!"" (not always along those lines, but same idea every time.) I understand that they're trying to tell me I'm pretty and feminine (edit: this sounds horribly vain now that I'm rereading this, that's not how I meant it, sorry!), but they don't have to do that at the expense of other women, and my appearance has nothing to do with my engineering abilities!"

"When my ex-husband said, ""You're holding me back from winning."" 

I will never forget those words and it was the beginning of the end for us. A position (promotion within the company) had opened up in a location across the country. A place I told him I would not move to. We had discussed this many times and I had made it very clear where I would and would not be willing to move to, but he just didn't seem to care. ""Winning"" to him meant getting a promotion, but caring about what I wanted or needed didn't matter. This, coupled with him not understanding that I can't have kids (for medical reasons and is something we found out after we got married) and blaming me for that, was where it all fell apart. We are still friends, but I never looked at him the same after that.

"Years ago, I was engaged to a very religious man who wanted to wait until our wedding night for sex.  

Meanwhile, he was hooking up with other closeted gay guys at his church, behind my back.  Some of them were married with kids.  One of them called me and told me about it.

No, it would not have been worth it to me to wait for sex and be married to a closeted gay guy who didn't want to have sex with me.  (and there are lots of similar stories to this over at /r/deadbedrooms, too)

"If you think about it, so many women are taught to be embarrassed of expressing their sexuality.

There's only one person in the room and he's still my boyfriend. Sounds like a pretty chill evening
"When dealing with 'my' kids' school stuff, people would look to me for a signature or something - took fighting every impulse to not be like ""Great! I'll go home and get a grown-up to sign this and bring it back!"" Nope. *I'm* the grown-up. Bizarre. 

Also, that being able to get whatever I want at the food store would never get old!"
"When I hear that someone votes Republican in this day and age, I automatically think they are both racist (particularly given the current GOP leadership) and less intelligent than your average wet sock.  When I hear that someone faithfully votes Democrat, I assume they don't pay very much attention and are big fans of band-aiding problems rather than finding solutions.

I also don't trust people with a lot of money, but that has to do with how I was raised."
"Artificial power imbalance.

This happens with both my best friend and my mother. In both relationships, I am the ""lower"" player and they are the ""higher"". They'll occasionally tease me about things, or try to lightly put me in my place. It's kind of difficult to articulate. Minor insults. Unwanted advice. It can be obnoxious, and I rarely, if ever, retaliate.

The reason is that I have so many things they don't have, and it's a way of subtly, unspokenly maintaining balance. I was able to move out, develop a good career, buy a home, marry an excellent man etc... and they weren't. Life was cruel and harsh to them. The things I have they've had to work so much harder to obtain, assuming they ever get them.

This creates a bitterness and resentment, an unwanted jealousy, towards me. But they love me, as I love them, so they would never hold it against me. However, now and again, one of them puffs their chest and ""puts me in my place"" by offering unsolicited advice, giving an unwanted opinion, and I take it gracefully because it's a very small price to pay for having such loyal and dear loved ones.

I'm down with that and have even made it into a fun date.  Awkward and boring things can be made fun if you just have a good laugh at yourself.  It really isn't that big of a deal.
"Ha, I caused the opposite problem. I had learned in high school anatomy that men were just plain physically stronger than women (on average.) I was so terrified of accidentally hurting her that my first girlfriend likened my excessively gentle foreplay to being felt up by a kitten."
"When I first used to sleep with my ex he'd say, ""I'm gonna knock you up someday!  I'm gonna put a baby in you!"" really fiercely during sex.  I thought that was really weird but it also didn't bother me (except sometimes I had to try not to laugh) so I decided not to cramp his style.  He did it off and on for a few years til I casually mentioned I thought it surprising that he found that sexy.  He was like, ""What?  I don't.  I thought you did.""

(He never did knock me up... thank goodness.)"
"Freedom of speech. In general, it is great. You should be able to say whatever you want in a public place and not have to worry about getting sent to prison or whatever. However, Reddit takes it to an extreme. People want to be able to be mean-spirited, spiteful, hateful, racist, homophobic, sexist, what have you. People want to say the word faggot so bad. They want to be able to use the word retarded or autistic as an insult. They want to be able to wish that all fat people die and want subreddits like coontown to keep on existing. Why is it so important for Reddit to be hateful? It makes me almost wish this website was more heavily censored so the bigots could leave as they once promised they would. "
"I'm 26, and it's a little longer than waist length right now. 

I plan to have long hair my entire life. I'm going to be an old hippie lady with a long grey braid. "

Mine would have to be male masturbation. It's the category I watch the most and would probably feel a little uncomfortable if he found out.

"&gt; I think many white people are socially conditioned to avoid mentioning a person's race.

I teach chess at elementary schools and so often I hear kids telling their friends it's not okay to mention someone's race. I've overheard teachers telling kids it's rude to point out someone's race. Also since we're playing chess and one kid is ""white"" player and the other ""black"" player I usually hear a child say that ""that's racist!"". 

I've gotten a little tired of explaining that it's okay to mention someone's ethnicity. Sure, it can be something that people might be touchy about, like anytime you point out something specific about a person. Therefore you should be conscientious to avoid being rude. That and how racism is when you judge someone's character solely based off their ethnicity. Of course kids will joke no matter what, but I honestly think that many of them are confused about what it really means to be racist.

Ugh and sort of a tangent, but I still see ""tolerance"" posted all over elementary schools. Drives me crazy that we preach that instead of acceptance. 

TL;DR a lot of kids are taught that it's rude to mention race"
I'm black and white and OMG is the fetish bs annoying and degrading from both sides. 
"He's a perfectionist. 

On the one hand, everything he does is, well, perfect. Our front lawn looks like a golf course -- no weeds, perfect height, perfect colour. He carefully monitors the internal temperature of the meat he cooks and it never goes a degree above or below where he wants it. Our hardwood floors are basically always gleaming. 

On the other hand, everything he does *has to be* perfect and it can be an infuriating process. He spends *hours* fretting about our lawn and comparing it to others. He will actually pace in front of whatever he's cooking and God forbid you don't check the temperature every five minutes. We have pets on that gleaming hardwood and he winces every time they so much as move; I'm terrified to think what kind of floor related anxiety he'll have when we have kids. 

I love him. I love his drive to do things right. I just think he could let up a little sometimes."
"When I'm at work in professional attire, I feel like a kid playing dress up make believe.  I thought I'd feel more mature, but really I just feel like I'm pretending."
"When I was 23 I was in a long distance relationship. I had graduated college, working full time, paid my own bills--you know, real grown up stuff. But I was still floored that I could just up and fly across the country to meet some guy and didn't need anyone's permission. The first time I flew by myself was really strange."
"&gt; I can't count of how many times I've asked a white person to describe someone to me and seen that far off look in their eyes as they try to avoid saying the word ""black."" As if it's an insult. Just say it. 

For myself in the past, that discomfort has come from the fact that had the person been white, I wouldn't have described their race *at all*. It'd be that *tall* guy, the one with the dark hair - not white. So in the second between realising that I'd only use race as a descriptor for POC and saying it, there's a whole lot of embarrassment. "
Howl from Howl's Moving Castle. Oooooooh boy. 
"We broke up six months in, got back together two months after that and got married five years after that. All good here!

Now that I have a keyboard edit: We broke up early in the relationship because I went through a depressive episode and convinced myself it was him. I did a little rebounding, worked on my mental health a little, and then called him up because I missed him. He was a little hesitant (the breakup had been sudden and I hadn't really given him any reason for it, so it hurt him) and it took a while for him to trust me again. But it made both of us learn more about ourselves and each other. We learned about communication. We both learned how to better manage my mood swings and work through them. We've gone through a lot together since then (mostly outside stressors like job loss, deaths, etc), but we've been a great team. We're deliriously happy together, and I honestly think that our short breakup strengthened our relationship."
"He's with me, so he must have *really* good taste in women. "
"Just strive to be the best boss you can be. Imagine the type of boss you'd want, and do that. Don't try too hard to prove you're ""one of the guys,"" and don't pull the ""I'm right / you have to respect me because I'm your boss"" card. Respect has to be earned, doesn't matter if you're a higher rank or not.

I'm an engineer, best boss I ever had was one who trusted my abilities and just let me do my own thing after giving me a deadline. He'd check in occasionally to make sure I hadn't run into any issues, but I never felt like he was hovering and not trusting the quality of my work. If I'm ever in a management position, that's how I'd strive to act."
"I think it's difficult for some men to give unconditionnal compliments. Saying ""you're so pretty BUT"" gives the woman the impression that they're flawed and here is one of the rare persons who will be able to see some positive aspect to her... therefore giving her the feeling that she needs him, otherwise she'll end up alone.

It's like a particularly insidious form of negging to gain power over the other person. 

My personal rule is that compliments and apologies are voided by the use of ""but"". ""I'm sorry but"" = ""I'm not really sorry"". ""You're pretty but"" = ""I am made of dirty butts and you shouldn't speak to me anymore."""
"Generic things like ""I like adventures"" ""I like animals"" ""love to travel"" ""get to know me"" ""Netflix"" similar poses across profiles etc... And just general uncreative things that most humans share.

"I met a guy in a store while on summer break from college. He was cute and charming - asked if I wanted to meet up at a bar and watch a game.

I was 21 - so beer and a game was a perfect first date. He picked me up and about 2 innings into the baseball game I realized he knew nothing about baseball. After a tortuous hour of explaining some smaller things to him, he asked if I wanted to walk a few blocks to another bar that his buddy was a bartender at.

We walked to a carnival/clown building. It was a punk rock strip club. It was also a Saturday at like.. 5pm. He then proceeded to buy me a drink and disappear to ""go say hi to his friend"". Another drink appeared - I gave it to one of the girls.

He came back after 10 minutes (I was about to call my mom for a ride home) and asked if I wanted to go to one more stop. I declined, but he pressed - saying it was a high-class bar on the water just a few blocks away. We walked there - and walked into an empty bar. He ordered another drink for us and excused himself to the bathroom. I asked the bartender if he was getting off soon, told him my tale of woe, and offered him every last dime in my purse to give me a ride home. He took pity on me and offered to call his brother to help if needed.

I ended up calling my mom. She drove 45 minutes to get me and back.

This was about 8 years ago and we still call this guy Mayonnaise because he had the IQ of a condiment.

EDIT: I forgot to add that he wanted to go somewhere down the street - some club - but I declined (thats why I called my mom to get me). Turns out the ""club"" he had wanted to go to was an 18+ foam party. Which wouldnt have been bad, but I was certainly not dressed to attend something like that."
"I learned that in general, LGBTQ spaces in college are there to make allies feel comfortable, not for queer students to have a space.

also, i absolutely cannot stand being around theater people."
"Almost nothing. I think men's fashion is fucking awesome right now. I love the long-on-top-short-on-sides hair cut, I love the slim-cut suits, I love the thin-but-not-too-thin ties, I think the jogger pant cut on men is fucking hot, I love the kicks, I love the tapered pants, I love the pinrolls on said tapered pants, I love the Americana shit, I love the ""goth ninja""/street shit, I love everything.

My only gripe I can think of is that more men don't *want* to take advantage of all the sweet stuff (in my opinion) going on right now, lol."
Why'd you do it? 
\* *furiously takes notes* *
He would *relish* the opportunity.
SHIT same! You'd think teeth would be a requirement for the pants party.
"If I'm running for my life, I'm not going to keep my heels on just to prove ... what exactly? That I'm able to survive even when my clothing leaves me at a disadvantage? That I can still look sexy to my coworker while we try to escape a wild animal? How is that empowering?"
"I'm 32 (as of today!), hair to my boobs"
Dunk-A-roos. Especially the ones that had sprinkles.
"For real my first ""celebrity crush."" There's a bartender in my town who bears a weirdly striking resemblance considering he's, y'know, a human person, but I have zero complaints. Yeah boy. Shake that cocktail. Let's get down to business."
"Sometimes I feel like I'm bad at being a woman because I don't even own any matching bra &amp; panties. I mean, I have some that happen to be the same color, if that counts? 

It's on my list of things to buy to make me feel like an adult. "
