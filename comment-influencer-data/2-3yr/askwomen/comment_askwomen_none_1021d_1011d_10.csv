"""Call me a bitch.""

*calls me a bitch*

*breaks down in tears*"
"Shower sex. It's the absolute worst. Chilly, wobbly, dangerous, and the water makes lubrication really hard. "
Was vacuuming couch with hose attachment. Husband was sitting right there in his undies. Remembered movies where men are shown to get pleasure from penis-in-vacuum. Think what a fantastic idea it would be to surprise him with a sexy vacuum-job. Sucked his nut straight up the hose with the force of a thousand suns. Turns out that is not sexy.
"My fiance is a popcorn fiend. The most intense time was I had to work 9-1 on a Saturday, got home, and he has somehow managed to consume 6 bags of popcorn and was passed out napping. No clear evidence of drugs or alcohol having been used. There was another popped bag still in the microwave. I only noticed because our microwave beeps every so often between the timer going off and the door being opened. "
"So I make soaps and scrubs, and I had ordered some ingredients in, one being fine grain dead sea salts. It was marked on the invoice as DEADFINE.

My husband found the invoice for said order and looks at it, then at me while pointing at the invoice and goes

""Babe, are you sea salt? Because you fine, you DEADFINE""

I let out both a groan and a chuckle and he is just looking at me like (☞ﾟ∀ﾟ)☞"
"I am currently arguing with someone over whether or not a woman is obligated to indulge her husband's urination kink. This guy is arguing that she should do it even if it makes her deeply uncomfortable because otherwise her husband will resent not having his needs met. He hasn't considered that feeling forced into doing something sexual  that disgusts you can also breed resentment....

Anyways it made me curious what other terrible sex advice you've seen on here. "
"My husband makes up songs. He can take any song and change the lyrics to match exactly with whatever is happening in that moment. They are usually silly songs, and longer he goes the more ridiculous they get. He does this all the time. And every time I think ""this is my life now"". "
"whipped cream...it's cold, messy and i'm lactose intolerant"
My boyfriend and I were tipsy one night while fooling around and decided it'd be sexy to lick chocolate syrup off one another...we didn't have chocolate syrup so we used Peanut Butter. 0/10 would recommend. 
"I was talking to this guy about anal. I said I had nothing against it, but felt guys should be open to receiving if they *expected* their partners to be game. I also thought it made more sense for guys to be into it because, y'know, prostates. He then tried to convince me that the g-spot was in a girl's ass. **He** tried to convince **me.** 

...Yeah. He refused to believe me."
Heard a bit of a commotion in the living room last night (bf is having a few beers) went through and he had scratches all over his forehead?? Turns out he tried to wear the cat as a hat and she didn't like that much...he's 33. This is what I have to deal with. Plus he starts a new job today.
Women clean up the dinner mess while the menfolk watch the game. This has happened at nearly every holiday dinner party I've been to. 
"Last year I bought my sister a year's subscription to Birchbox (full size makeup and skincare products delivered monthly) and she said ""omg we got each other the same thing!""

No, we didnt. She gave me a box of free samples she got from Sephora with her own, expensive purchases. "
"I thought a little of the ""slut"" or ""whore"" dirty talk would be fun but it made me sad instead. "
"I hate to say it but... no. As soon as he wakes up I shoo him into the bathroom so he can put his face on. Without his layers of foundation and bronzer, smokey eye, and purple lipstick, I can barely stand the sight of him.

**/s**"
Crotchless panties were a letdown. They chafe both parties and steal lubrication. 
"When my husband and I first moved in together he would leave me a sweet, short, romantic note each morning. 
It's now over ten years later and he still does it! I always though this kind of thing would go away, but every morning I have a new sweet and romantic message from my man. That's who I chose to spend the rest of my life with. &lt;3"
"Yeaah, I had this same experience with an ex. Dirty talk, dirty talk, all going fine. He then went for 'you're a slut, you're only good for having a cock in you.'


Too mean. I cried."
"My fiancé talks in his sleep. He's a little insecure about it, but I find it adorable. Topics vary wildly. Sometimes he speaks Polish which is how I know he's dreaming about talking to his relatives. But the most common phrases, in addition to my name, are ""Baby, I love you"" and ""You're perfect"". I usually wake up before him to have coffee and make his lunch and I often find myself smiling on my way to the kitchen every morning as a result."
"Sex in public places. There is definitely a thrill, but I don't find it sexy. I'm terrified of being caught the entire time and can't enjoy it. "
You should indulge a man in any sex act he desires even if you find it degrading and disgusting or you're just not a good partner. That bullshit is rampant on reddit.
"Favorite quote: ""I've found that relationships work best when no one is wearing pants.""

EDIT: My first gold for a sex joke. I'll gladly take it :-)"
"You'll be pleased to hear in our household, my wife and I feel the same way about meal cleanup. 

That's why we have kids, and they do the cleanup."
The [Veiled Virgin](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sgcziPi5giQ/VPmU2_X_nhI/AAAAAAAAAIA/0xA8Y-z9IkE/s1600/VEILED%2BVIRGIN.jpg). I'm just like...HOW DID YOU DO IT? MAGIC? It's a sculpture but you've made it look veiled with a translucent fabric. Just amazing.
"The details. I never used to moisturise, prime or fix my face. My makeup is 10,000 times better since ive started doing all of the above. 

- I moisturise with ""Simple"" moisturiser twice a day, in the morning and at night. Its made the world of difference to my skin, without makeup. A good canvas is important.
- I use ""Rimmel fix and perfect primer"" before i put my makeup on. Its provides a barrier between the makeup and my skin, and the makeup goes on easier and smoother. I also get better coverage.
- I use ""Urban Decay All Nighter"" fixing spray. THIS CHANGED MY LIFE. I fiddle a lot and touch my face often, which used to result on transfer. This stuff keeps your face SET. Literally all day. Never have to reapply anything. 

Beauty Blender is also amazing. I also learned that sometimes quality products are worth what you pay. I used to always go for the cheapest items, but since ive started investing in better quality, ive found the pigments are better, i use less and they last so so much longer. "
"Yes, that's why I quit facebook. My life is pretty great, but I kept seeing other people do all these awesome things. Well it's different people so of course there's going to be a lot of awesome stories, but it made me feel my life wasn't as awesome. Although it actually was.

When I got obsessed with likes, I quit. Very suddenly. Mom is still sad I left facebook. "
The man proposes to the woman and the woman is never allowed to mention marriage or she may spook him away forever. Because being unclear about your wants and needs and just hoping your partner will magically be on the same wavelength as you is a great idea and always works out well
"69.
I find it too difficult to get into. Maybe it's just me, but something about the multitasking just doesn't work for me."
"Driver's ed instructor: drive in the middle of the street if it's a local road and nobody is coming in the other direction

Result: failed my driving test because I kept driving in the middle of the street

Honestly I think I was a worse driver after driver's ed"
"I had horrible, trashy tenants in a home I rented once who caused thousands in damage (well above and beyond the deposit) and refused to take responsibility for it. They didn't respond to my attorney's attempts to collect, and the last straw was when my neighbor showed me a screenshot of the renter's facebook in which she basically was laughing about it. I am not a vindictive person at all, but it pissed me off. I took them to court, which they weren't expecting, and paid extra to have the summons served on Christmas Eve. (And I also won my case.) She brought up the Christmas eve thing in court and said it ruined their kids' Christmas and tried to get the judge to side with them and he lit into them. It was funny. "
"I was making grilled cheese sandwiches for dinner and had just put his on the table and mine in the skillet.


me: your sandwich is ready. (motion towards the table)

him: walks by and stares intently into the skillet at my raw sandwich.

me: (confused) what are you...?

him: reaches with his hand (not spatula) to take sandwich out of hot skillet.

me: what are you doing?! yours is over there!

"
"Sexist double standards. My personal 'favorite' is when overweight men start trashing overweight women as ugly/worthless and think they are entitled to a model. You're entitled to your sexual preferences, but the hypocrisy is extremely rude."
"You're moving too quickly when in between the heart-shaped feelings and exhilarating moments you catch yourself feeling rushed.

Or, when you are doing all these relationship-y things with them, yet you have no idea how trustworthy they are. One thing I read here in Reddit which made tons of sense and I wish I had heard of it earlier: if you aren't sure if you can trust them with your house keys or not, you've probably moved too fast."
"Don't know if it's worth ""holy grail"" status, but warming up your mascara before you apply it helps it go on more smoothly, especially if you're...shall we say...not exactly diligent about replacing your mascara every three months, like you're supposed to. I stick the mascara under my boob while I do my eyeliner and whatever."
"The notion that there must be one person in the relationship who ""wears the pants"" (that is to be the more dominant one, whose words matter more). Duh, can't we just be equal instead? "
"In my experience, it's because I was too shy and closed off to men. I would see friends who I thought were less pretty (I know that's rude, sorry) get tons of male attention, and I thought, ""Why not me?""

Well, it turns out that you have to be friendly and flirty and show interest in men instead of just standing around, doing nothing, and hoping they come to you."
Lmao he put himself in a popcorn coma.
"Reddit is *obsessed* with anal. 

I keep seeing on /r/relationships that if you did anal with a previous partner but refuse to do it with a new one, then you're treating the new one like shit (heh) and deserve to be dumped/don't love the new guy as much as the old one/should do it even if you don't want to because your new guy should get everything the old guy gets. It makes me fucking sick. Like, no motherfucker, I'm not obliged to let ANYONE up my butt."
Sex up against a wall. It always looks so sexy in movies. My first time dating someone who was strong enough to hold me up I was pretty excited to try it but in reality your butt/back are chafing against the wall and it's so uncomfortable.
"Just because you're married doesn't mean you have to lose your spine, and give into your spouse's every desire. It's not like you're withholding sex entirely. You're just not comfortable doing a certain thing, and that's perfectly fine and should be easy to understand.

&gt; He hasn't considered that feeling forced into doing something sexual that disgusts you can also breed resentment 

Very good point."
"""You're a bitch"" /= ""Yeah, you're a good little bitch.""

IMHO, I think dirty talk works best when there's an indication the talker is taking pleasure in it. Getting each other off is the point, after all. ""You're a bitch"" is mean (which works for some). ""Yeah, you're a good little bitch"" sends the message that the person's getting off on it, and saying that kind of stuff is a bit naughty, adding to the enjoyment. Also a bit of Dom/sub paradigm in play. The obvious message of pleasure negates the insult in the word ""bitch,"" while keeping the ""oh my, that's terribly uncouth"" transgressive energy. Good old-fashioned fun."
Just put up with (insert specific sex act here) even if you hate it and it causes you pain. You might just be 'doing it wrong'.
"One time I was at school and went to get Starbucks. It was cold and rainy. There was a homeless guy across the street, so I bought him a hot chocolate when I got mine. When I went to go give him his drink, another homeless guy showed up. 

I didn't drink any hot chocolate that day. "
"BDSM. I really enjoy it in fiction, porn, and fantasy, but in reality I find nothing arousing about domming and subbing gives me panic attacks most of the time. 

I learned a long time ago that a lot of the things I think are sexy in theory/porn are not things I actually enjoy outside of fantasy."
"I've had men comment, and I've encountered a ton of men online who have strong opinions about it. 


You can get whitening creams but I really don't recommend it. I just try to accept it and realize the men who are put off by it aren't worth my time or energy. "
"The man's job is the ""real"" job. The woman's job is just ancillary. They move because of his job, not hers. She has to do work arounds to meet his needs. If someone has to leave work to care for a child, it's her, not him."

"This week: two girls chatting about the baby shower registry the very pregnant one was creating. The friend pointed out that there were multiple duplicates and, without missing a beat, Pregnant Girl replied with ""I know. We want to get the same stuff so we can keep one and take the others back for cash without hurting anyone's feelings. We did it with [first baby] and it worked awesome. All three grandmothers think they got us the Baby Bjorn high chair."""
"I refuse to look at him until he's done his make up. 
 "
"""Baby, I love you.""

Aww...

""You're perfect.""

Tee hee...

""I'm so glad we finally met, Jessica Alba.""

WHAT?!?!"
"This guy I was seeing a few years back had the key for the apartment of a couple of newlyweds he was friends with while they were on their honeymoon. 

He asked me to help him collect and photoshop pics of Nicolas Cage which he printed out at work, and we went over to the couple's place, had a few beers and plastered that shit in every nook and cranny we could find while giggling all the way through. Not covering the walls or anything, but some obvious places and some very well hidden. Under the PC's mouse, toilet lid, in CD casings, etc.

The couple has actually split up by now, but I like to believe they still haven't found all of the Cages.

It didn't work out with me and the guy because the chemistry just didn't feel right, but we are still very good friends to this day."
"Lingerie, every single fricken time it looks so good in the store or on the hanger. Put it on, it fits, look in mirror.... scream in disgust and recoil in fear of what I see before me. I've given up, naked is sexy, right?"
"Yeah, always go swimming on one of the first dates to see if that cake of make-up falls off. I hate false advertisement when men look so hot in the initial dating phase with their hair gel and foundation, but really they're a -2/10. I really like the natural make-up look, even though I am clueless as to how much work and energy it takes to live up to the bare minimum of beauty requirements. "
Sex in the forest. WTF were we thinking. Nothing feels comfortable and every sound makes it seem like someone's coming (*besides us*). 
"Last year at the family Christmas party my grandma got up and started passing out all the presents she had gotten everyone. From cameras, $50 gift cards, jewelry...oh and three oranges in a walmart sack. That was mine. She gave it to me and at first I thought it was something she got for herself and left in the box of wrapped gifts. Nope, all mine. My husband and kid even got cool presents.

 I still don't know what to think about that. At the time I was confused and a little amused, but now I just wonder if she was trying to be passive aggressive or if she is just getting old and had a ""moment"" and really forgot about me."
"Turns out for me ""you're a good girl"" or something to that extent reaaaalllyyy get things moving.. "
"My ultimate favorite product is Biore's watery essence sunscreen. You have to order this online as it is not sold in the US. OMG it will change your life. I hated, hated, hated putting on sunscreen because of the horrible consistency and smell. Always breaking out. But this product goes on and feels great, and then feels like nothing. The smell is a light citrus and even that quickly fades. And it works!"
"Overheard my professor and a classmate talking the other day.

Professor: Oh you used to be a hooker??

Student: Yeah! When I was a lot skinnier though haha.

Professor: That's great! I was a hooker in high school!



Turns out they were talking about rugby. Woops. "
"I shouldn't laugh, really."
"""if your boyfriend/ girlfriend is mad or upset with you. Because you tried to perform a sexual act on them. Without them not knowing because they are Sleep or drunk. And you guys never had a conversation about it before hand. That's their problem not yours honestly you guys are dating anyway. So it is not like it's rape ""

Honestly every time I see this I cringe especially if op is a girl who did it to her boyfriend. Then I know I'll see "" I know tons of guys who wish he was in his shoes. he's probably more upset he wasn't able to participate"" or ""he'll get over it"" I just don't understand this way of thinking at all."
"Last one, two university students talking on an Istanbul ferry.

Guy 1: She called me over, we had sex. I invited her to watch a movie but she ignored my text. Called me over again two days later, we had sex. We are fuck buddies now, right? She doesn't want a relationship?

Guy 2: You are fuck without the 'buddies'."
"""Never half-ass two things. Whole-ass one thing."" - Ron Swanson"
"All women are submissive, and if they're not, they just haven't met the right dom/daddy/alpha male yet. So if your boyfriend wants you to be submissive in bed you should just go along with it because you will definitely 100% realize that this is what you secretly craved all along because bio troofs, despite you being completely certain it isn't. 

I'm not saying there's anything wrong with women who genuinely enjoy being submissive, all the power and great enjoyable sex to you. I just sometimes get a little frustrated with how often the assumption that women are all submissive is build into sex advice I find here on reddit.... And honestly I'd rather be celibate. 

The cherry on top is of course that if you finally run into someone who doesn't assume all women are submissive, they assume you're a dominatrix instead... Because there can be no middle ground apparently. "
problem with lactose intolerance isn't so much barfing...it's more gassy than that.
"Holy shit yes.

We had a get together this summer, and my friends house rules are if you didn't cook, you clean up afterwards.  For reference, my friends boyfriend did the grilling and a few of us brought other food and casserole veggies, so it was a fairly gender less split of cooks/cleaners.

Only one friends boyfriend blew a FIT that he was expected to clean up.  He had never cleaned up at a party before, his girlfriend (who had brought two dozen homemade cupcakes and made guacamole there, so was a ""cook"") should clean up for him, this wasn't fair etc etc.  No rationale of ""each of us contributes"" stopped the tantrum.

They broke up not long afterwards."
"My mother is an ungrateful gift recipient.  Nothing will please her no matter the effort put into it.  One year she complained about the gift I got her so much (a new car stereo) that when I left, I took it with me.  "
Mostly I see it when guys try to show how vulnerable a woman is.  She is walking alone(or a small group of women) so guys catcall her or follow her.  Stand way too close and leer because they can.
"Every single time I move in bed and wake my partner up, he shakes his head, looks at me and calls me beautiful and that he loves me and falls immediately asleep again. He says he had no idea he does that and it just warms my heart every time. It's lovely to be this loved. "
"I used to not mind the men who were ""projects"" and needed help. Now I'm only attracted to men who are fully realized individuals with jobs, reliable transportation, and savings accounts. "
My boyfriend is on the quest to become Han Solo. He dotes on how attractive Harrison Ford is. He asks his hairstylist for Han Solo hair. He dumped a ton of money on a Han Solo replica costume. He randomly says Han Solo's lines. I think I might actually be dating Han Solo.
"He loves to create fake history.  When I'm on long drives away from home, we chat and somehow get into how the French Canadian war began over a literal cat infestation that resulted in a massive plague of cat scratch fever which could only ever be a major bone of contention between Canada and the US until Japan, with their cat cafes, was able to broker a peace agreement.

Here's the thing - about 75% of what he's describing is based on fact - he was a history major - and the rest of it is his improvisation.  And the stories can go for hours!

I find myself laughing and in tears, flying down the highway thinking - this IS my life, now.  And it's so precious."
"""Why would a woman go to a bar alone unless she wanted sexual validation from men?""  

He went on to say that women should expect to be raped, sexually assaulted, and disrespected by men when they go out in public alone. 

He then said that rape isn't real because it's illegal, and that if a rape was legitimate, more ""rapists""  would be in jail. 

He then said transgender people are ""just really mentally ill"".  

This was all in a span of about three hours. Dude was physically hotter than bubbling cheese, but after talking like that he was more repulsive than a sewer mutant. "
"Not me but somebody told my friend that cooking oil works better than sunscreen 

Cue massive blisters and completely burned "
"The idea that (in a man/woman relationship) it's the woman's job to remember birthdays and buy gifts and cards for not just her own family but for her SO's entire family too. The hell with that. How am I supposed to know what his brother's wife wants for Christmas? 


I've always been firm about not doing this since the beginning of my relationship. Last year, my husband forgot his mum's birthday. It sucked and I felt really bad for her, but it is his responsibility, not mine. 


*Women are not naturally good at this stuff any more than men are. We learn to pay attention because we are under pressure to be more thoughtful and caring from a very early age, and people judge us way more harshly than men when we slip up.*"
"Rimming. (I've only ever received, not given.) It's *okay* but mostly I'm lying there like ""oh god I hope I washed well, what is he even getting out of this, hmmmmmmmmmm......""

Current SO tried it on me and then was like ""uhh, that wasn't as exciting as I thought it would be . . . I'm gonna go brush my teeth real quick"""
"Latex suit. Don't get me wrong, the guy was really into it and it was pretty hot when we were playing, but getting in and out of that thing was a nightmare. There's not enough baby powder in the world to make it comfortable."
"I wouldn't say the *worst*, but it was definitely way less enjoyable than I thought it would be.

I like really hot showers, my ex not so much. Constantly fidgeting with the knobs as we change positions / who's actually under the shower... Yea just too much of a hassle. Fun on occasion, but definitely not what I thought it would be."
I'm imagining the episode of Friends with Ross trapped in the bathroom in sweaty leather pants.
"This one is funny because It's only based on what the man wants. If a woman is into fetishes that the man finds degrading (such as femdom, pegging, MMF threesomes, etc) the man would complain that he shouldn't have to do that. Utter BS. "
threesome with twins. it was incredibly awkward with them avoiding eye contact as they took turns. siblings who do sexual shit with each other/share partners are fucked up boundary wise even if they look the same and the fallout was crazy. not recommended ever.
I'm sorry for your misfortune but I genuinely laughed out loud at the image of you licking whipped cream off someones chest then immediately barfing it back onto them. 
"The ones who want every woman to have sex with them by date 3-4 ""to determine sexual chemistry"" but then don't want to date any woman who has slept with more than like 4 people"
"I once got a plain mustard yellow long sleeve tee from a relative for Christmas.  
  
One, my colouring means anything yellow makes me look like I'm dying. Two, it was two sizes too big. Three, it was *from the store I worked at*, so I knew it was a 5 dollar out-of-season sale item. Four, it had a pen mark on the sleeve. Five, it was from a relative that I *don't* exchange gifts with, so even though it clearly wasn't bought with me in mind and I hated it, *I* still looked like an asshole because I didn't have anything ready to give back to them."
Do you like pats on the head and belly rubs too?
Wearing nothing under a trench coat in public... while my SO and I were dating long distance I decided it would be sexy if I picked him up from the bus station on a weekend he was visiting and then casually mention as we made our way home that I was naked under the trench coat. His bus got stuck in traffic in the Lincoln tunnel and I had to wander port authority bus terminal for an hour terrified that some grifter was going to see my vagina.

"Shower sex and sex on our couch. He's a foot taller than me, so oral, grinding, and making out in the shower is fun. Trying to enjoy sex while balancing on tip toes and avoiding faceplanting into the shower wall isn't. We've tried the couch, but it slips and slides all over the hardwood floor, the cushions keep falling off, and it's just impossible to find a decently comfortable position."
Calling their president the leader of the free world. Wha?
"I don't get intimidated easily but... I've had a few uneasy experiences with men who I think or assume were just working up the courage to approach me. 

I don't think they realized by constantly staring, showing up where I am, etc, was making me very uncomfortable. "
"Cut your hair they said. Get layers. It will be cute. 

OMG. Took a whole year to grow it out. I hated it. "
"It was definitely the most unusual, but I'll never forget it. There was a guy I was seeing for a short while and he worked in a museum. It was in our small, sleepy college town, but it was a huge, amazing museum with all kinds of treasures about the town's history. I loved it. 

I went to the museum ostensibly so he could give me a tour, but I just wanted an excuse to be around him and listen to him wax poetic about something he was passionate about. He was naturally shy and monotone, so I ate up watching him come to life as he showed me the museum. Until that point, I had felt like I'd dominated conversation with my babbling. It was really refreshing to have the tables turned for once.

It was magical.

Before we entered each room, he would put his hands on my shoulders and say, ""Wait here, please."" Then he'd go in front of me and activate the motion-sensored lights. I joked that he looked like Elsa building her ice palace in Frozen. He agreed that that's how he felt. 

We basically just stood around and chatted. It was fun just following him around while he got all excited about the displays in the museum. 

We'd agreed to have lunch together. He told me to meet him at the museum and he'd take care of lunch. When we got to the end of the tour, he took me by the hand and led me to the elevator that led to the third story, which was just storage. But as we ascended, I realized the elevator went up further than the third story.

It opened out on the roof of the museum, where he'd set up two chairs and a card table with a checkered table cloth and take-out boxes from Denny's with breakfast. 

The part that makes me smile, since it was such a sweet touch, was that he'd gotten one of the old 1930s portable phonographs from the attic of the museum and played quiet jazz music on it while we ate. 

After we ate, we walked around and talked. We could not stop talking. I'll forever treasure that. 

It didn't work out with him for other reasons, but that was easily the most unusual and fun date I've ever been on. "
"Before, then PIV feels better and more intense for me "
"Every time that hairy dork makes an obscure reference to Star Trek TNG. Everything can always be compared to a character, event, or story plot, its really geeky and adorable. That and the fact that he still likes me and my bald head I got as a result of chemo. "

"Sister 2 needs to realize that your choice to have a kid or not does not affect her ability to have children. If you had had a baby, I bet she would still be sour over it. Unless she wants to adopt your kid, it's really none of her business and doesn't affect her. "
"&gt;It always looks so sexy in movies

It's so annoying though, right? Wall-sex is like the sexiest sex to ever sex in movies and TV shows. Makes me feel like I'm missing out so much, except I know in reality it'd be terrible. "
"Mine does the same thing! It's almost always my name, and he usually adds in ""You're my best friend"" and he sleep kisses. I filmed it once because he didn't believe me, and he hated it!"

"I was in an airport waiting to fly home, and I sat in the boarding area to wait. Two army guys sat a couple rows behind me...and started debating over whether babies or children would be better to eat.  Because children have more meat, but babies would be more tender. It was a very calm, thoughtful conversation where they acknowledged one another's point before countering with a different one.

I probably looked like I was convulsing because I was trying so hard to not burst out laughing.  I didn't want them to realize I could hear in case they stopped! I'm so disappointed that the flight boarded before they reached an agreement. 

Best part? The look of absolute disgust on two old ladies' faces as the guys walked away to board. I guess they weren't as appreciative as me."
"""You have to talk to him and try to work it out. Marriage isn't about being right, sometimes you have to apologize even if you haven't done anything wrong.""

The husband in question refused to discuss any of our problems and in the 7 years we were together, I never heard an apology from him. Everything was always my fault. Thankfully we separated after only two (very long and unhappy) years."
"""Likes"" are the worst. When I (rarely) post something, I always find myself saying ""I don't care about likes,"" but then I obsessively check over the next 24 hours to see how many I get. I then compare this number with that of other friends and then I get so depressed if I have significantly fewer likes. It is not healthy. :/"
"Ugh me too. Degrading stuff does't necessarily bother me during sex but my current guy said ""You're my whore,"" the other day and I was basically like ""FUCK YOU I'M NOT YOUR WHORE"" and just recoiled pretty hard from that."

"On Thanksgiving my four year old niece asked why I didn't buy her more presents from my recent trip to Iceland and how if I loved her, I should have bought more stuff for her. She then went on to punch me in my ass and stood there waiting for a response. 

I replied by burping into her face and told her if she ever asks me a dumb question like that again, I'll make sure she never receives love or gifts from anyone.

Needless to say she ran off crying meanwhile my other nieces and nephews burst out laughing.

"I used to work at an amusement park and we had to use the same bathrooms as the guests. On my break once I heard:

Mom: You have to go right? What do you have to do, #1 or 2?

Kid: I have to take a shit!

Mom: Don't say that word! That's a bad word!

Kid: But mom, you say it all the time!

Then I heard laughter from like half the stalls. XD"
"I'm small, and some guys take that as an invitation to pick me up without asking, which is intimidating as hell. Any form of strongly holding onto a girl feels really horrible because  I don't think guys realise we LITERALLY can't break free, and we're aware of it, and it's scary. Like drunk guys at the end of a night out, who might even be my friend, who hug too hard. Or playfully restraining me so I won't leave a party, or any display of physical dominance over me. It's not impressive or attractive, or funny, it's intimidating. There are genuinely nice guys who do this because they don't realise that this is actually how a lot of assaults start. Even if your intention is innocent, you have to be mindful of what it feels like for the other person. 

Also, please bear in mind the context of the situation when you're hitting on a girl. Sometimes I find it flattering to be approached when out in public - but only if it's a safe environment, like a big crowd, middle of the day etc. Just because you feel safe waiting at your local bus stop at night doesn't mean that girl does.

"Christmas 1994. I think, maybe a year or two before or after. My brother and his friends had had this thing going on with roadkill for the past six months or so. It started with a dead squirrel on the front porch and escalated to a deer carcass shoved into a jeep with a bag of flour shook out all over it. I can't explain, I don't understand. He and his friends were just weird. Like they seriously needed the internet to happen to keep them occupied. Anyway, I was also huge into thrift store clothes at the time (shit was all Marcia Brady back then and AWESOME). So Christmas rolls around and my mom went and got me a bunch of thrift store stuff and stuffed it into a huge box, about 3 foot square. So I open my big gift and the first thing I see on top is a big heap of animal fur. I instantly thought that it was another round of the dammed roadkill game. I burst into horrified tears and ran down the hall to my room to finish freaking the fuck out. My entire family is mystified and comes to get me. I begin shrieking about how they finally went too far with the damned dead animals and fuck, fuck, Christmas fuckitty fuck. My mom bursts out laughing, my brother (really a great guy) comes into comfort me, and mom explains that it was a 60s patchwork rabbit fur coat she found for me in the thrift store. I wasn't crazy about the coat, but I settled down and Christmas continued without a further hitch.

******
TL;DR : My brother's roadkill fetish conditioned me to interpret a well meaning gift as a box of animal corpses.

"OK so here goes nothing!  

When my husband and I were dating we were fooling around, and when he goes down on me I don't last long at all. Its not unlike me to think about random things in order to last longer. 

Well, this night he's going down on me, my toes start curling, I start getting close, and I naturally start thinking about things completely unrelated to sex. 

One idiotic thought about a vagina being called a clam leads to another, and I start thinking about clams and if they produce pearls. I finally come to the conclusion that oysters produce pearls. Right as I come to that the conclusion this building orgasm starts taking me over, and as I go to say 

""Don't stop, I'm going to cum."" 

I ended up saying

 ""Don't stop an oyster is going to come out."" 

Well right about that time he stops and says 

""What in the fuck did you just say?""

Let the screaming laughter ensue and I started laughing to keep from killing myself. 
It took about an hour for the mood to Come back because I was so embarrassed. 

Now it's an ongoing joke. If I'm getting a shower before sex he will say, 
""Wash that pussy out girl, I don't want a damn oyster coming out.""

If we are eating seafood with people he'll ask if they knew oysters were my favorite. 

I still want to die, but at least it makes for a good story.

That the chemo wasn't going to save her, and that it was a huge waste of money, and that it was delaying the life insurance payout that he NEEDED!

What if you want more food than what they give you? How is that disrespectful?!

"The problem I have with bdsm (as a Dom) is that it turns sex into a task/job to complete and not just a fun thing to do. It's like when you take your hobby and try to do it for a living. 

Monitor her response, punish more or less to compensate, be quick to respond to her defiance in a way that will increase her arousal. Better tighten these bindings, she's moving much. Oh, she would really be good with hard cock, too bad, I'm limp because I've been working instead of having sex. "

"One of my best friends was seeing a guy, and they were both incredibly jealous people. He would message me at the end of the weekend asking what we ""really"" did that weekend, to see if my friend was lying to him if we ever went out without him. I of course would always stick to the story my friend told, but made sure to be super friendly with him, so he always trusted me, and thought we were buds. She went onto his account one night, read our messages, thought I was trying to steal him from behind her back, and ended our friendship. We never made up, and like 6 years later when she dated a friend of mine, she told him I tried to steal her bf, so she still believed it, even after I did whatever I could to prove otherwise. Good riddance I guess."
"Oh my god, I've been reading these responses all day and this, by far, is the greatest one I've seen. Feel bad for your husband, also hope he's okay after the encounter with the most literal performance of ""suck my balls,"" but it made for a pretty good laugh here!"
"I would say there were probably two moments that really stand out for me. 

The first thing happened in the early stages of us beginning to happen, if you will. My boyfriend is very stoic and can come off as emotionless or callous by times. We were friends for about 6 months or so before we got together, and then close, flirty friends for about another year. So, at this point I knew he had emotions, but he never really opened up until that one day. 

We were sitting together and he just opened up to me, and told me about his childhood, his family, his worries. He had never ever done that before, shown himself to be so vulnerable to me. It made me realize that I loved him, it sort of hit me that day that I had loved him for a while, and that is about when our relationship really began. 


The other moment was when we were already together for quite a while, and he was running around closing all the windows. I asked him why they were all open because it was really cold out that day, and he said it was because he always opens them before I come over, because he wants to ""freshen up the place."" Even though we had already been together for a while at that point, he still made an effort to make me comfortable and think well of him (which I already did). &lt;3

"I think it really depends on the couch, some are more difficult than others."
"I always feel ungrateful when I talk about this, but:

I was a massive tomboy of a kid, and when I was about ten years old I asked my mother for an armchair or beanbag chair for my bedroom because I wanted somewhere to read in my room other than my bed.

Instead I got a seat shaped like a giant high heeled shoe, because that was what my mother's friend's daughter who was also my age wanted. The things were ridiculously uncomfortable, had no sides on them, and because of the shape your knees were higher than your butt and you were leaning back on like a 45 degree angle.

I feel bad calling it the worst I've gotten, because she had sort of slightly listened to me? And because it cost like a hundred dollars, so I felt really bad for not liking it. I just felt like she didn't stop for ten seconds to think about me and what I would like, and just bought what her friend was buying (and later told me how her friend had bought a floor model with a small tear in it because it was significantly cheaper, and she paid full price for my one because she didn't want to get me one with a tear in it). The thing sat in the corner of my room for years, never got used other than to stack books on like a table.

Runner up: My Aunt always gives me alcohol for Christmas, apparently she's the only one in my entire extended family who doesn't know I don't drink? Not even an Aunt I never see or hear from, it's weird.

"Yup! His facial features are legit amazing - he's got big eyes, long lashes, a big crooked nose, a wide mouth with big lips and he smirks with one side, he's got high, prominent cheekbones, and a strong jaw/chin. I could look at his face for forever. 

(I love this question though - it's silly how often we talk about how attractive or professional women may or may not look without make up when most men walk around without it all day.) "
"Oh, there are a few.

- Politics: my grandmother is as socialist as they come. My dad is a fiscal conservative. She is also a monarchist (sort of); my dad is not. My mom ultimately ordered them not to discuss politics anymore because it always ruined our family gatherings. 

- My grandmother is also one of those ""everything is better in the Old Country"" immigrants. Which drives my dad crazy. There have been frequent arguments of ""if everything is so awesome in England *go back there*."" He hates it when she starts grumbling about Canadians having no respect for the Royal family or terrible food or terrible weather or ""no history/culture because this country is too young."" I actually find it funny to listen to because I'm pretty sure she just does it now to piss him off, but my dad gets enraged. 

- My brother's life plans/lack thereof. No faster way to make my parents' heads explode than for my brother to express that he's been doing absolutely nothing for the last year. I wish he'd at least lie and say something like ""I'm exploring a lot of different options"" instead of saying ""Nope, haven't looked into employment or school or anything at all."" WHY START THAT FIGHT. WHY.       "
"Yes, and I can't delete Facebook because that's how I communicate with family and other people. Still it sucks to scroll only to see how great everyone is doing and how behind I am in life. I don't know why I do this to myself."
He told me he stopped talking to his former best friend after finding out he was gay.
"I wish! 

But I have noticed that I became far less attractive to men, and far *more* attractive to women when I do these things: 

* Wear less/no make-up         
* Express my style, even if it's not sexy

Whereas it's almost exclusively men who like me if I: 

* Wear a lot of make-up      
* Wear tight revealing clothing, even if it's unstylish and boring   

In the first scenario, I get a lot of women saying how naturally beautiful I am, how cool my style is, how hot my vibe is, etc. 

In the second scenario, I get a lot of men cat calling, following me down the street, buying me drinks, asking for my number before they've even spoken to me, etc. 

I have a friend who is GORGEOUS, think Agyness Deyn meets Ruby Rose. But her style is the first scenario, and she has very short hair which seems to be off-putting to some men. She gets so many women who are into her. And almost zero men. And unfortunately for her, she's heterosexual. "

"Bride plans the wedding.  Groom shows up.

This Thanksgiving weekend, my fiancee and I got drunk with my parents, and my mother was like ""I know you said we couldn't do a bridal shower..."" and I was like ""Huh?  I'm open to a bridal shower if you want to do that,"" and she was like ""REALLY?  YAY OMG""  So later when I went downstairs with her to get more wine, I was like ""Hey I'm sorry if I gave you any impression that I want or don't want anything, besides the food and the location, nothing is set in stone yet, so if you have any ideas I'd love to hear them and talk about it"" and she was like ""Oh when you were all noncommittal about a bridal shower I assumed you didn't want one,"" and I said ""Oh no!  I'm noncommittal because I don't want to say yes to anything without discussing it privately with fiancee first!""

And she was just so shocked, like ""OH YEAH!  THIS WEDDING HAS TWO BRIDES!""

And I'm like, is this a gay thing?  Do straight people really just dump all the design decisions on the lady and she just makes unilateral decisions across the board at a moment's notice?  Is that not freaking crazy?  Do straight couples not have shared Pinterest boards that they bounce back and forth during office lunch breaks?  How do straight people plan weddings?  I feel like I should know this by being steeped in this culture but I don't understand!"

"I sometimes go to a blog where the blogger gives really nice level-headed advice on dating and relationships. In one post he told the following story:

Some girl met her fiance's parents and they were rude to her. This led to an extended argument with her fiance. He did apologize for his parents' behavior, but the girl wanted him to somehow make his parents change their treatment of her, which the guy said he couldn't do.

Lo and behold, the girl listens to her friend's advice:""Just ask him to buy you a brand handbag as apology. You'll be happy to have the bag at least, and it'll be good for him too since it's an easier way to placate you than changing his parent's behavior.""

The girl did that, the guy told her ""I didn't know you were that kind of person. I was mistaken."", called off the wedding and broke up. The girl cried and begged and explained to no avail."
"THIS SO MUCH.

So many people can't leave it alone that some people might not be into it, and no, I don't need to try (just lube up and relax, you'll love it!) in order to know that the thought does not appeal to me in the slightest."
"I was going down on a girl and I thought about how much I enjoy eye contact while receiving, realized I never ever reciprocated, so I made special effort to look up.

So now we're both laughing too hard to continue, and I learned to not do that."

Within 10 mins of cracking a beer and having a few strawberries, the park supervisor (we'll call him Lahey) comes out of nowhere and startles the fuck out of me. He asked firmly why the hell we were there, and without missing a beat, m'lady replied, ""oh hey man we're just down here hanging with my parents at their friends Jim and Sally's right over there (pointing)"". As I'm trying not to die inside, Lahey said, ""Yeah okay Jim and Sally are great people, however theyre actually in the park next door so as soon as you finish up eating just head back over to that property. Have a great night.""

It was immediately then that I knew this woman would be my ride or die for always. Five years and kicking strong. "

"Growing up, my dad used to routinely announce to the kids which parent's income 'paid' for a given part of our lives. Dad's money paid for the house, our food, our electricity. Mom's money paid for 'extra stuff', like soccer uniforms and birthday presents. Because he made more money than my mom, he truly seemed to believe that her career was more like a hobby we could all do without.

It wasn't until I had my own full-time job that I realized how absurd that was."

"I spent seven years pursuing academia. I've always felt like I should be an academic, doing research and writing papers. 

About two years ago, I started baking for fun. I realized I was pretty good at it and I had loads of fun doing it. 

Then I realized that no matter what I was doing, I would *always* rather be baking. I was always looking for recipes and reading about the science of baking and trying to learn new techniques. 

So in August, I dropped out and enrolled in pastry school. I've never felt more secure in what I'm doing. I'm having dreams about opening a bakery, I'm baking every day, and I'm genuinely happy and motivated. "

"Seriously there is such a huge difference in the kinds of problems I see with therapy clients in same sex vs. opposite sex relationships. Those in opposite sex relationships have so many incompatibility issues due to gender (socialization, of course - not anything inherent). 

Everything from the way they show emotions, to extrapolating to all men/women (the most common thing I hear is ""I just don't get women"" or ""I want to give up on men""), to very literal issues with gender roles (husband feels emasculated because [insert here]). Same sex couples skip all of that, and relate to the person like an individual. They don't see them through this web of mental concepts. 

That's why I can't date any men with strong gender socialization. It does not work for me. And it doesn't work for them, because I scare them by threatening their masculinity. "

I (Eastern European) had a pretty close guy friend at the time who was black and the guy I liked didn't know about him yet. 

The guy I liked saw me at a coffee shop with him and asked me who he was. I said he was just a friend, which really that was all. He said ""girls who fuck black guys are disgusting"" and I said ""well I'm not sleeping with him and that's a messed up thing to say""

He kept going off about how he hates white women who sleep with black men and I was just looking at him in shock. I'm pretty sure he didn't want me to even be friends with him.

Long story short, I cut off all ties with him. I wasn't going to drop a good friend who has been nothing but nice to me and others for a guy. 

Lost all respect for him that night."

"It was at the tail end of the relationship with my ex, he really wanted to have sex and I just couldn't think about anything but breaking up with him. He threw a hissy fit (pouted, wouldn't let me touch him at all, took the blankets, made shitty comments) so I eventually relented. I figured it would be the last time I would have the chance to have sex in a while. 

He usually took forever to orgasm and always played it off as, ""I want you to cum first."" I usually did but he would take so long I would be falling asleep before he got the chance (think 2 hours). So we start to have sex, it's going alright, I orgasm quickly (per the norm) and my vagina just shuts. He said it felt like it was pushing him out and when he tried to put it back in it hurt. I've never had anything like that happen before and we had to stop. It was pretty obvious my body was just not having it. "

"For years, my family plays games on Christmas Eve with other families. Kids weren't allowed because the games got raunchy, so I wasn't allowed to play until I was 15. It was like a coming of age thing. 

When the grandkids came along, suddenly it changed. It was my turn to bring the game one year and I said I was bringing Cards Against Humanity, so no kids. This didn't fly and my parents went and bought a different game instead of just telling the little kids to go do something else. Pissed me off, so I packed up my things and went to the bar where my friend was having a birthday party. We got the whole bar (12 people maybe) to play with us. It was fun, but my family was pissed at me for leaving. 

I've missed game night every year since. I'm coming back this year though since I found Santa vs. Jesus. Everyone's excited to play. "
He's fine now but the immediate shriek of pain and then the horrified thousand yard stare of hurt and betrayal that followed will probably follow me to the grave. He did not marry a smart lady :(
"&gt;it turns out that you have to be friendly and flirty and show interest in men instead of just standing around, doing nothing, and hoping they come to you.

This has been the conclusion I've reached.

Being conventionally attractive is a double-edged sword. People tell you you're pretty and it builds up your ego, which is great. The problem starts when you believe that's *all* you need. ""I'm pretty, why aren't men/women flocking to me?"" You sit around, expecting people to approach you just because of your looks. The fact is a lot of people are nervous to approach someone, particularly if that someone is attractive. So taking a little initiative helps a lot."
"We were in a club, I was only there because I had been day drinking and can't say no to a night out when already drunk! He came over and spoke funny (he's from Wolverhampton, google the accent it's strong and special) started telling me how he didn't really know anyone apart from his mate who was talking to a girl but that he wasn't interested in meeting anyone. I thought he was weird. He asked me to dance and then did the weirdest and funniest dancing I've ever seen, I was hooked on how he was a giver of no shits. I wasn't sure he was interested but he asked for my number as I was leaving. I was actually leaving to go see my fuck buddy and blew him out after giving my now husband my number. 

We saw each other the next night, then moved in together after 3 months. We just celebrated our 10 years together and 5 years married and have adopted 2 boys. "
Another way to answer this Q: Don't let other people tell you how you should assess your relationship with a SO. 
I know
"Well, if she's looking to adopt, there are about 140 million orphan children in the world. Idk, she's being really salty about this and you are definitely a more mature person for trying to reach out. "

"So it DOES happen.

I work in a pharmacy lab with strict shifts, so the amount of employees is always the same depending on the moment of the day. When I start the lab at 8 (opening hour) with FlakyCoworker, I show up 10 minutes early so I can start cleaning, opening the computers and listening to the messages we got when closed. FC will generally show up around 8h05-8h10, and then will :

* Go back in the breakroom because she just realized she's in opened toe high heels when we're required to wear flat closed shoes (5 minutes of disappearance);
* Go to the bathroom because woops! She didn't have the time to apply make up before leaving her house (10 more minutes of disappearance);
* Leave the store altogether because she didn't have breakfast so she's going to get a coffee and bagel and does anyone want anything? She's buying. (10 to 20 minutes of disappearance depending on how busy the bistrot is);
* Come back and surprise surprise, one of the customer waiting is one of her friends so they will start chatting for 15-20 minutes in their native language that no one on the team understands, so that way she can say it was business-related. Sure.

Altogether, she's supposed to start working at 8 but will effectively start working around 8h45-9h15. If I start at 8, I'm effectively working from 7h45 to 8h45 alone, dealing with everything (taking medication orders on the phone and in person, preparing medication, helping the pharmacist, etc.) alone, since there are only two lab employees starting at 8 and no other employee is scheduled until 9. It sucks and it enrages me. 

We've complained to the boss multiple times about her behaviour and talked to her too. The boss is temperamental and believes that we should have chosen another way to break in the news to him, FC thinks that we're exagerating and since she stopped showing up 30-40 minutes late to work, we should give her some slack.

All. Of. My. What.

Luckily, this is a temporary job. "

"that's the kicker, you don't, it always feels right. it all comes down to how well you know the person truly, i think. when i moved too fast with a person i didn't even know all that well, it's been the shitshow you might expect. that included the 5 years of chatting online with my ex husband before we met irl.

and it's definitely a red flag if you get the feeling that this person is in a serious goddamn hurry to lock you down, going against your desire to slow down by proclaiming undying love (that simply can't wait for some reason)

i am in a relationship that some would deem too fast (engaged less than a year after dating) but i had known him for years and been besties for awhile. i knew that although i was idealizing things a bit, we more or less knew and fell in love with each others' real self."
"A handmade three wick candle in a hand thrown crock from the lady in my grandmothers hometown.

2. Most of them were freesia scented. I'm allergic to freesia. I have been my whole life. My aunt insists on getting me more freesia candles. The ones I actually CAN use are from other family members. 

3. My mom is allergic to pretty much ALL perfumes. So even if I wanted to burn them and I'm not allergic, she is so I can't. They're literally $20-$30 candles that can't be burned because of the allergies of the two females in the house. 

4. When I move out I don't want to bring 40 fucking candles with me. I'm selling them in a yard sale soon. "
"Feeling emasculated if I'm better at something than him, or if I have interests that are traditionally ""masculine"" that he's not interested in.

Neediness and clinginess. I have my own life and just because I'm not willing to drop everything all the time to tend to your every need doesn't mean I don't care about you, it just means I have my own shit to do. I'm not trying to be somebody's whole world.

"ok. when i was in college, one of my roommates was...argumentative, and the kind of person who always had to win. well, when i was in college, *i* was the kind of person who always had to win (okay, i still am...i'm working on it). she was also into subtle one-uppsmanship, and so was i...great combination :)

anyway, when i was in high school, i did not take ap calculus. in fact, i didn't do any sort of calculus track at all -- i went from geometry to ap stats, and i didn't take a math course in my senior year at all. my roommate was a math person, i was not (and she knew this). anyway, we got into some argument, one day, about something...apparently related to math, because she said something like ""well i took ap calc, you didn't."" and i was like ""actually i did."" i really just said that to shut her up. i was lying. she knew i was lying, but she didn't have any proof, so she couldn't call me out on it. 

but she spent the next six months or so trying to ""out"" my lie -- by asking me ""innocent"" questions like ""oh, what did your ap calc class start with? we started with _____."" now, i'm really good at bullshitting, so i managed to throw around some calculus-related words and say something vague-enough that she still couldn't call me out. 

but the kicker was the next semester, when my OTHER roommate needed to take a calculus class to complete her math requirement. she asked my roommate if she could tutor her in calculus, and my roommate was pretty busy (she had an off-campus internship) so she said she couldn't...""but why don't you ask alzayz? she took ap calc too.""

at that point i couldn't decline, so i was like ""SURE I WILL TUTOR YOU IN CALCULUS LET'S DO THIS SHIT.""

the good news is that i'm extremely good at learning stuff on the fly. and because this was an intro calculus class, the textbook was a good resource. i tutored my roommate for the entire semester. she did really well, too -- a or a-, can't remember. after that, my other roommate no longer tried to discredit my obvious calculus skills.

yep. i taught myself calculus to maintain the lie!! i guess in the end we all won, but it was definitely a lie that blew up..."

Yes, I do have a smart phone. Unfortunately, it's a Windows phone, and most apps don't even bother making a Windows OS version of their app, so I can't use them. But explaining that to people is a pain in the ass so it's easier to just say I don't have a smart phone. "

Sure, there are way more younger woman older man relationships than vice versa, but you can't distill that down to pure attraction... There's a lot more going on. And it's not some universal truth like middle aged men like to think. Unless you're George Clooney and/or very wealthy then no, hot young girls don't wanna fuck you, no matter what you say."

It was so little and cute. The snake was just curious I guess..."
"""Only date people you would consider marrying""

Terrible advice. Especially the way it was presented to me which was entirely based on judging people for elitist bullshit reasons that stunted me both emotionally and socially. Deprives you completely of the ability to learn and discern who and what you like. 

Not saying date people who radically oppose things that you fundamentally believe, not even saying lower your standards, but I always took that advice to be about someone's resume, when really the most important thing I've learned is finding people who receive and give love, attention, affection the way you enjoy receiving and giving it.

"I guess when I proposed to my wife. She had this photo as her laptop background ever since I met her, this beautiful lake. She called it her happy place. But she didn't know where it was. I reverse image searched and found out it was in Yosemite. 

I told her we were going to go somewhere but it was a surprise. Took her on a plane and car ride. She was really excited when she found out it was Yosemite, but I didn't want to reveal the lake until we got there. 

We went on a hike, and arrived at the place photo was taken from. I'll never forget her face when she realized! She started crying. We sat there for awhile, snuggled up because it was cold. When the sun started setting, I launched into a kind of speech about how special she was to me and all that. (And I started crying too...) Then I got down on one knee and whipped out the ring. Then we went back to our cabin for sexy times. "

I went to an all girls high school and didn't know anyone who found men that age attractive. If you got hit on by someone that age you felt creeped out. I remember even being 20 and men in their 30's hitting on me and having zero attraction to them. I was into really skinny, non-hairy boys. Who would have thought that now at age 27 I find men in their 30's with muscles and chest hair attractive.

"Dolphin condoms

This is for the funny blooper reel. We found dolphin condoms at CVS once so of course we had to try it. The condom was built like a dolphin with a wide tip for the ""head"" and a dolphin snout. It was silly looking and we started attempting to make dolphin noises during foreplay, but neither of us knew what they sounded like. Gave up and did the deed - sure enough, the condom made ""click-click-click"" dolphin sounds with all the air stuck in it's ""head""."

So there we were and it was awful. Not only was I scared of being caught but the sand was everywhere. In my ass crack, my mouth, my beard, my nose, my armpits and in between our bodies just grindind away skin on my chest. I said I think we should stop and she got pissed. ""You've been fucking me with a sand covered dick, its like being fucked with sandpaper. You are GOING to finish.""  So I kept going for a few minutes and then faked an orgasm. She called me on it and I lied and insisted I did. We both hated the experience. Would not recommend it anyone. "

At this point I'd consider it a win if they'd just let me know they got their packages since I worry about them being stolen or delivered to the wrong house or whatever.  

I thought maybe they just hated their gifts so I switched to gift cards a couple of years ago, still nothing.  

I don't want to be that person who is like ""You didn't give me the acknowledgment I wanted so you don't get anything!"" because I genuinely do enjoy giving gifts and it is supposed to be about them and not me.  But damn, is ""I got your gift, thanks"" really that difficult?"
Just say that her kink is not getting pissed on. It's what turns her on more than anything.
"raw grilled cheese.. hehe

at first I thought you were saying that he wanted you to have the finished one and he'd cook the other one himself"

"Yup. My BF and I got into a huge fight because we see my family so much more than his, go on trips with them, he's way closer to them than I am his family. 


But we see them because I plan and organize it. Id love to see his family more - but they've are super disorganized (we won't know what they are doing for Christmases until the 23rd which also fucks up my family planning) and he tends to avoiding spending time with them. Yet gets upset whenever I'm not close to them or when he realizes my family views him like a son but his family barely knows me. 



It's not my fucking job to set up time spent with his family. "
"I just realized that the stories that immediately pop into my head are grocery store related...

Once, in a busy Costco meat department on a Sunday, he shouted my name from about 50 feet away, and I turned to find him holding a 2 foot long shrink-wrapped pork tenderloin at crotch-level, dry humping the air. 

Another time, we went to the grocery store together in a hurry because we have somewhere to be in about an hour. On the way in, he promises to help me gather things from the list so we can get out of there quickly, but upon entering the store apparently he becomes a zombie. In the produce aisle, I ask him to go grab 2 red and 2 green bell peppers. I resume getting *literally all the rest of the produce on the list* as he wanders aimlessly around the department, and then have to flag him down...and he turns to look at me...with a yellow bell pepper in one hand and an orange bell pepper in the other.

He's a very intelligent guy. He just gets...weird around grocery stores. But, one very sweet and sort of carefree thing that has lasted nearly nine years since our grad school days... on our way out of any grocery store together, when he's pushing the cart, he'll stop just as we get to the asphalt, signaling me to step onto the back of the cart and hold on... then he pushes off and we ""ride"" the cart like a couple of kids back to the car. Every time. I suspect he parks further away than he has to so we can have a longer ride. 

I love that goofball."
Ugh any long fingernails.  *shudder.*
"I'm the opposite, I like doing it, but I would never let her go down there. "
"Legolas is *technically* the oldest of the bunch. Sure, Gandalf existed before the creation of Middle Earth, but since he died fighting the Balrog and was reborn, that makes him a few months old at most."
"Unfortunately, especially for those new to the kink, they don't always understand that dirty talk and degradation are two separate things. Sure, There can be overlap, and sometimes there is, but like you said, it's not something you can assume.

I am a huge fan of dirty talk. Not so much for degrading my partner. Hell, I would probably be the one crying if i said mean things to her."
Did your instructor mean a residential road that has no line or divider? That kind of makes sense.  But any old local road?  That's baffling!
"That's a condition called acanthosis nigricans, and is an indicator of insulin resistance. What OP is referring to is darkening of skin in legs and arm pits, where skin rubs together and isn't necessarily due to diabetes. Also being overweight doesn't mean someone is diabetic"
"there was this dude who seemed fine, didn't smell, but one day i noticed a wet brown spot on the bed after we fucked. i was humiliated because i thought it was from me.

then the first time we did it at his house, i went to the bathroom and saw dirty underwear with caked. on. shit. all over it. i screamed internally and broke things off soon after. bonus points: got scabies from his nasty secondhand couch.

it still absolutely baffles me how he could not smell like shit."
"This isn't cultural imperialism so much as companies trying to move more product, but in Central Europe in the late 90s, candy companies were desperate to make Halloween a thing. I remember ""helpful"" fluff pieces in magazines trying to explain trick-or-treating to the locals, surrounded by full-page chocolate ads. Of course, this was a place that just doesn't have American community culture in the least bit, so I heard numerous people express utter bewilderment at the idea that children should go up to strangers' houses in the dark and receive gifts for bothering those people. I don't know if it ever caught on. "
"Probably isn't my biggest but it is the most recent that has pissed me off. It seems lately I can't have a conversation about anything with a guy before it turns out to clearly be a subversive attempt to steer me into talking about dating or sex. Like god dammit, I'm trying to talk about this thing and have a friendly discussion/debate, and then you go asking if I'm single or what my ideal guy is like.....I just wanted to talk dammit, can you not? "
Getting over my shyness and social anxiety would be at the top of the list.
Well I've never been fat and have darkened skin. It's totally normal pigmentation.

"At a company I used to work at, I was told to blacklist overly insistent candidates. At the same time, all 50+ year olds give that same advice, be persistent! It'll pay off eventually! Show up in person, it shows interest!

Edit: It was a small company (~ 25 employees)"
"They prefer girls with no make-up, make-up. It's amazing how many of them think that's how we actually look without makeup."
"That was the first thing she said *""I would have adopted it""*, so now she sees it as something I was going to give her (that was never going to happen anyway), that I took from her.

It's fine, it's my niece's birthday this weekend so I'm going to send a neutral ""Happy Birthday Niece"" message. Unfortunately, I'm not home for Christmas this year, but I've bought her ""Chicken Soup for the Sister's Soul"" as a sort of 'olive branch' gift."
"This is my argument for every partner who tries to manipulate me into anal! It shut my ex up for an hour at the most. He'd always react extremely ""ew no that's wrong absolutely disgusting"""". I pointed out if he was comfortable with his sexuality then no, it wouldn't be disgusting, it could feel nice. I just said why should I go through what to me is excruciating pain when you wouldn't be willing to do the same. All I was asking was to stick a dildo up his ass ffs but nooo"
Hallelujah its rainin' men
"The one position that ""works"" for us is him holding me up. We are neither of us pixies, and the concentration of trying *not to die* is a realllll boner killer. We gave up shower sex like year one of our currently six year relationship."
"Posted this one in another thread too... During my second-to-last year of high school all my friends turned on me, leaving me pretty much friendless. For my birthday that year one of the girls in that group gave me, in person, a book called ""How to be Popular."" :("
Fuck... I just realized I used to do this in high school because I was just way too timid and insecure to actually approach people so I'd just 'coincidentally' end up in the same place as the person of interest hoping they'd initiate something. Never even realized it could come off as creepy.

"Yes! I know this is meant to be a jokey post but...I'mma brag for a minute cause I rarely get to do it. My boyfriend probably wouldn't be considered conventionally handsome. He's the quiet and shy gamer type, not at all a social butterfly, tends to be a loner, so I feel like no one would really tell him this stuff.

I'm always struck by how pretty his eyes are, a soft brown with really just average lashes, but they're just like, so pretty to me. Pretty in the gentle morning light when I can see freckles at the creases of his eyes, even though his skin has some pockmarks from young-adult-acne. Pretty looking at me upside down from bed, gently rounded crescents crinkled with intimate affection. Really expressive when they're scrunched together in hilarious laughter, which brings me to the second thing I love most about him...

He's got this absolutely *radiant* smile and laugh, it's glorious and it sounds like some sort of busily motoring tractor farm equipment but I fucking love it. His friend has described it as ""maniacal"" before and I wonder if he's self conscious about it, but hearing it brings me to this next level of hilarity. I'm in love with his smile, my lips are kinda big and my smile sort of just stretches horizontally, but he has conventionally-thin but expressive lips that curve into a brilliant smile. I can't think of any other way to describe it than radiant. Literally seeing it and the laugh in a natural form, whether he's looking at me or there was a funny moment on a tv show or he's just messing around and being goofy, it makes my heart stutter a bit.

We're technically still in that ""young love"" phase I guess, just over a year of dating, but I don't think I'll ever get tired of his pretty eyes and amazing smile. Yeah, his nose is kinda wide and he has a bit of a unibrow and his skin isn't perfect and his teeth are kinda wonky, but by god do I feel so incredibly lucky whenever I look at him."
"""It's forming some sort of a PASTE!""

yeah i'll take your word and stay away, thanks. :)"
"Of all their hypocritical behavior, the men who body-shame women the most tend to be the ones who are pathetically out of shape themselves - the dad-bods, the abnormally hairy dudes, the guys who skip leg day, the bros with receding hairlines and combovers, the boys who pick clothing that doesn't match their bodies - those types and so many more."
I volunteer to work on holidays for the extra pay and to avoid my family
The GF and I use a pair some times. Just make sure you got the right ones. Dont let the threads hug the penis. It's common sense that would chafe. You gotta have ones that open past the labia majora. Should be safe if you get the ones that also expose the asshole since the hole is bigger. Zipper ones are a bad idea especially if you're not shaved.

He considered the burn my fault for quite some time..."

"Trying to help an old lady at work who was looking for something she ""knew"" she saw at my work.



I KNOW for certain we NEVER had it. Tried very patiently to politely explain that we didn't and maybe she saw it elsewhere. She got angry at me and said ""you should never tell a customer they are wrong! That is very rude!"" 

I never even used the word ""wrong"".

After she left me and a few other customers in the store had a good laugh."

"My husband's brother was living with us and I kicked him out maybe a week before Christmas.

He *super* deserved it and I don't feel terribly bad about it, but the proximity to the holidays just made it extra insulting in his eyes."
"My ex made me a home made shirt with borderlands on it, which was incredibly sweet. Unfortunately, they used a dye that smells like Urine to cats. I got pissed on by two cats in one day, which was not fun. 

Edit: if you're my ex reading this, I absolutely loved the gift and I appreciate it greatly, but it was definitely the worst experience from a gift."
My couch doesn't slip away when I try to grind on it. Maybe your couch isn't ready. 
He was just gassy
"Spanking.

I dunno man, the pain just kinda distracts me. It doesn't amplify anything for me. I wouldn't say it is a turn off completely, but it can be a little irritating if he is doing it all the time."
"My future husband and I had just started messaging on a dating website in early October my senior year of college. There is a six year age difference between us. 
Unlike everyone else he was a ""send one message a night"" kind of guy. Unless he had something going on that night. Then I wouldn't get a reply message back until the next day. 
We had just agreed to a date over my Thanksgiving break when I would be home and I didn't hear from him in five days. I couldn't figure out if he was forgetting about me or talking to me on the side while seeing someone else!
But we finally get to our first date and I'm slowly being swept away by him. He was so sweet and genuinely interested in me and I enjoyed getting to know him so much.
After dinner we walked around the town just to try to extend the date a little longer. While on that walk he said this to me...
""I know I wasn't very regular in messaging you back the last two months. I know you're in your senior year of college and you're doing lots of fun and exciting things. I don't want you to feel like you need to be waiting at your computer every night to talk to me when you could be out and enjoying this time in your life. You never get your senior year back.""
The wind got knocked out of my lungs. I hadn't even met this guy before tonight and he's been putting my needs first for the last two months!
I wasn't in love with him yet, but I knew I was going to marry him.
Tomorrow will be five years since that first date. We've been married two years and have a beautiful baby boy on the way this spring."
"[The Trumpeter](http://i.imgur.com/RFhwDui.jpg) by Zdzislaw Beksinski is by far the most fascinating painting I have ever seen. There is something so dark about his art that just draws me to it.

When talking about music there are just so many amazing songs that I can't just choose one. I am probably currently still obsessed with Nicolas Jaar's [new EP Sirens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNGlyOe3OBc&amp;list=PLvV7AzWbml08nBznkwK6_zpFFfoxSOV6L), that guy is a musical god among humans."
"My sister trying to show off how much money she has. She also talks more and more loudly until she's yelling, then I ask her to please lower her voice (it triggers my migraines) and she starts a fight about it, screaming ""You talk loud too and I don't whine about it!""

This year is going to be a little different though, since it's the first holiday season *ever* that she's single and I'm in a relationship (she recently got divorced after 14 years). She won't be able to do her usual routine of bashing my love life with lovely sayings like ""msstark's cupid must double as a garbage man!"""
It's not for everybody. Do your thang.
"My general rule is that when I'm subbing, my chosen partner can call me anything he wants as long as he prefaces it with ""my""."
"I've had a relationship where this worked for us, but afterwards I'd feel bad and be like: ""I don't really think you're a slut"" "
"I once went out to my favorite restaurant with my boyfriend and his roommate and we were all mega high. At the table next to us was a date that wasn't going well, probably the first or second. The guy was saying a lot of pretentious stuff about how he views the world and would one-up whatever story she told. The date ended with him saying, ""next date: nighttime bike riding!"" She had the most unenthusiastic, ""oh boy...""

I should note that we didn't realize until we sobered up that the couple could totally hear our analysis of their bad date. "
"Every year my middle brother got two, sometimes three gifts of coal. 

It started when we were really young. He had established himself as the clown and trouble-maker, so as a joke, my parents wrapped coal along with his other gifts. It was a big hit.

The next year, my oldest sister and brother did the same. After that, my little brother and I joined in. He never caught on that it was a coal gift until the minute he opened it. One year even he got one in a hand-made wooden box with elaborate carvings and a satiny lining.

He always took it like a champ, but I wouldn't blame him if he hates us all for it."
"When they can't handle another person disagreeing with their opinion. 

Example:
Him: ""I really like movie X""
You: ""Oh really? I thought Y was better.""
Him: ""No, you're wrong..."" and then he launches into a diatribe about why you shouldn't like movie Y because movie X is clearly superior. A confident person can handle dissenting opinions.

The opposite also screams of insecurity to me. You ask him his favorite movie, he tells you movie X, and you say movie Y is your favorite, and he immediately changes his favorite movie to agree with you. Again, a confident person can handle a dissenting opinion. "
"Another great chestnut of wisdom: ""If you have a degree, they *have to* pay you more than someone working the same job with no degree!"" Like it's some international job law or something. "
"I have two moments.

One being that we broke up when I moved out of state. He had broken up with me so I was really hurt. I'd loved him like no one else. So when we started talking again I decided to fly back to see some friends. It wasn't long after I was back that we made love like we hadn't skipped a beat since we last saw each other. 

The other is when I woke up gushing blood from my lady parts and ran to the bathroom. (I was super scared cause I haven't bled like that since giving birth to our daughter) When I got out of the shower I found him in the hallway, scrubbing my blood out of the carpet without a single complaint. 
"
"A man followed me for three blocks to try to get my number once. At multiple times I said, ""I'm going to meet with a friend for lunch, so I gotta go!"" but he kept trying to start up a conversation with me. I didn't want to cause a scene at the time, so I didn't tell him just to ""go away"", but now I kind of wish I did. He was annoying as hell and I felt on edge for the rest of the evening. Similar scenes have happened like that before, but none as drawn out. Some days I just don't have the energy to deal with it, so I ignore them completely, or give them awkward timid responses and then they end up insulting me and calling me odd, as if it's my fault they're close enough to touch a stranger and asking if she's single before even getting to know her name.

I can't tell if it's intimidating, or just frustrating as hell - probably both - but I would really like to live in a world where men in public wouldn't argue with you when you say ""I'm going now, goodbye!"" I didn't ASK you if you wanted me to leave. I *said* I was leaving. Don't follow me!

The intimidation factor comes in when you wonder whether or not they'll become unreasonable when you tell them straight out to leave you alone. It's hard not to assume they will when you've seen it happen so often."
