"I have a friend of an old roommate who got pregnant from a ONS. He was back up in Alaska doing commercial fishing when she realized she was pregnant. She got his number from some mutual friends (smallish town) and told him.

She is pro-life so she told him she was keeping it but he didn't have to be involved but she wanted him to have the choice. They are married with 3 kids and are one of the happiest couples I know.

He immediately took leave from his job and came back to town. They moved into a house together and he got a job in town so he could be there for her. 

Great kids too, and I don't even like most kids. 

It can work out. "
There's usually a lot of shock expressed in the how young were you when men started sexually harassing you type threads. 
"triggered. which sucks because i have ptsd but welp, nice to know that the *one fucking word* i had to describe to another human being why i ''randomly'' go to lay down and play dead for a couple hours can't be used bc it means i'm an over-sensitive crybaby."
"I have twins from a casual relationship. I am very pro-choice and I chose to keep them. It was a high risk pregnancy and he was around when it suited his schedule. I allowed him to be there when I was laboring, but when it was time to push and I could only have one person, I chose my mom. After they were born, again he saw them when it suited his schedule. He had an order for very minimal child support and never paid it (this was before automatic-withdrawal, or he worked under the table.) 


I met my now-husband online, and we got married. I petitioned the court to be allowed to leave the state and  still get child support. It was granted. I told my ex where we were moving, gave him my number, and didn't hear from him or get child support ever. Eventually I petitioned the court to terminate my ex's rights so my husband could adopt them. *My ex fought it, saying our children were too young to understand, but he wanted a relationship when they got older.* The judge absolutely tore him a new one, saying you don't get to CHOOSE when you're a parent.


My twins are teenagers. They *just* met their birth dad over the summer. He now has a drug problem and no gainful employment. My twins were not impressed. My husband is a very involved dad and they love him. 


I'm glad it worked out well for all of us, but I think the key was moving far away from the ex. Also, my ex's mom, my twins grandma, was a *lovely* kind involved grandma until her death (which is where my twins met their birth dad, at her funeral). She never made it awkward and I'm grateful for all her help and support over the years. 

TLDR Had twins with a casual boyfriend. Broke up. Married and moved away. Ex's rights terminated; husband adopted them. Kids are happy and love their dad. "
"If he says something along the lines of, ""I will personally hand you 5 million dollars if you vote for me.""


Even then I'll be apprehensive, honestly."
"yeah, especially on reddit. you can't complain about anything guys do without some form of ''well at least you get some validation that you're attractive'' and an earful about the plight of the involuntary dateless and evils of tinder.

guys in real life are more accepting, but in a detached sort of ''oh that sucks'' way. i think they really do feel bad for us, but they just can't know how it feels to go through it unless they have been sexually assaulted/harassed themselves. they're coming at it from their own perspective, which is one of never feeling truly *threatened* when strangers creep them out/offend them, and it only sucks and is easy to shrug off."
"I've been dealing with a lot of medical crap over the last couple years. I had major surgery in January and after being discharged, I had to sleep in the recliner in the living room for a month while one of my massive incisions healed.

He went out and got two-way baby monitors so that he could keep track of me late at night. He's too tall to sleep on our couch, and the hallway is shaped weirdly so it's impossible to hear anything from the bedroom. He got these baby monitors so that while I was out there, he'd hear me if I needed anything, and so that we could talk to each other. For the first two or three weeks that I was home, I couldn't even stand up or go to the bathroom without help, and I was in such a drugged-out haze to help with the pain. If I stopped snoring, he'd rush out to the living room to see why I was awake: ""Do you need another dose of pain meds? Are you thirsty? Can I get you something to eat? Do you need help getting to the bathroom?""

He changed my dressings, kept my incisions clean, emptied my drains twice a day, and just kept me on the right track so that I could totally heal up. While he was doing all that, he also held down the fort at home: dishes, fed and watered the cats, emptied the litterbox, took out the trash... I don't know how he kept everything together.

Baby monitors, man. I'm so in love with this guy. &lt;3

Edit: Thank you, everyone, for the awesome responses! I can't wait to show him when he gets home from work tonight. He's had a rough week, since I had another surgery on Wednesday (it went totally fine) and that got his anxiety up pretty high. Sometimes life can be overwhelming, but we're going to get through it together. Tell your loved ones that you love them, okay?"
"how cramps or period migraines are just part of life for us. we still go to work, take care of our kids, grocery shop, etc with most men none the wiser. as much as men like to accuse women of being on their periods, in my experience they are rarely accurate. "
"I got pregnant in college with a guy I had slept with only a few times. I told him and after deciding to keep the baby let him know that he could choose to be involved but if he was he would not be in and out of the child's life. I also told him if he did not want to be involved I would not seek any type of child support or money because I didn't want that to be his deciding factor. We spoke maybe three times while I was pregnant and one of those times was meeting each other's parents and our parents meeting each other which was pretty fucking awkward. I wouldn't even let him in the room during delivery. 

BUT he fell in love with our son the second he saw him. We never tried to date and we're better coparents because of that. There's no animosity or anger towards each other. No jealousy over new partners. And he's an amazing dad. We're able to coparent as friends and he's a better parent than a lot of people I know that had kids with boyfriends/girlfriends! "
"When my sister died, my mother said that the wrong daughter had died."
"What annoys me the most is that since I'm gay, some of my male friends think I have some anti-creep forcefield around me, or that I should be flattered for some reason. Telling a man that I have a girlfriend has sometimes amplified their creep level because to them, being gay = willing to have sex with them with my girlfriend. No, that's not a compliment. Yes, it gets annoying. "
That this whole campaign has been to illustrate how far American society has fallen due to the evils of the two party system.  He then goes on to outline his actual platform which falls ideologically far to the left of Sen. Clinton and apologizes abjectly for letting his experiment go this far.  
"Many of the men we care about are going to do or say something that makes us question whether they see women as fully human and equal to them. Not usually on purpose or out of malice, but said/done nonetheless.

The pain of that realization is sometimes very hard to deal with when you trust and love the men in your life. It doesn't mean you stop loving them, it's just something you try and either confront or come to terms with.

Women spend a lot of mental energy being aware of how we're perceived. 

We're hyper aware of our bodies and our voices and our space. We do it so much that it becomes second nature to make sure we're not too loud, our legs are crossed/closed, we're making a good impression on our employers or family or friends or dates, that we're not being watched by a predator or just someone who wants to remember what our asses look like when they jerk off, etc, etc... Even women who are more laid back, who don't wear makeup or dress up, are aware of themselves as being judged, because that's what we've grown up knowing. It's a little like walking through a world of mirrors. 

You can't really escape that part of your mind keeping tabs on everything.

Some of the first things you learn as a child are all about how to be a well-behaved, respectable girl. To watch yourself. And it never ends because it's everywhere.

If you choose defy this ingrained training, it does take a measure of courage and practice. Silencing all those voices. It's also why finding people you're truly comfortable with is an incredible blessing.

I used to think this was universal, but discussions with men have made me question this. I think men have moments of itense inward gaze (probably more if they're working with certain social pressures related to orientation or race), but most women are conscious of how they're perceived nearly 24/7 (even if we choose not to care). We are used to being objects of scrutiny.

Feel free to correct me if this is something you live with as well, guys. 

Also, many of us spend a truly ridiculous amount of our lives removing natural hair from our bodies."

"* One of those wall switches you can plug a lamp into so you can turn your lights on and off without getting out of bed.
* One of [these weird candles](https://www.diamondcandles.com/meet-the-ring-candle) I read about that has a ring in it.
* Spend a luxuriously ridiculous length of time deciding on a new hand lotion from, like, The Body Shop or L'Occitane.  Any shop that will let you try all the lotions.  And then keep it in your desk at work so you remember to use it.  
* Get a pedicure with super sparkly nail polish.  
* A venus flytrap.  You can name it after your favorite book character and obsessively instagram it.  [EDIT:  Comments have told me they are very hard to take care of.  So maybe consider a cactus instead?]
* And then you can buy new paper and markers and draw different backgrounds for your Venus Flytrap.  So, you could draw, like, a beach or the Eiffel Tower, and then masking tape it to the wall behind the plant.  
* Flowers!  
* Go book shopping at a thrift store.  Because $50 of thrift shop books is a lot of books.  And sometimes when you do that, you find a toy accordion for $4 and you get a new hobby.  
* Take a roll of pennies and go make wishes in a fountain at a mall.  
* Go to the dollar store for Christmas decorations.  Be super festive.  Have a couple santa hats and make people wear them if they visit you.  
* Pay a cleaning service to clean your place for you.  
* A bath sheet.  Which is just a giant towel.  At Target they cost a few dollars more.  So much better than a normal sized towel.

"I think that most any IRL guy who has talked with an IRL woman about her experiences wises up to it. My husband always assumed creepy PMs/cat calling/etc... were sporadic outliers until he was part of a conversation my sister and I were having about our own experiences with those things. The assumption had been that a) he'd never really seen it happen, b) normal guys don't act that way, and c) the world is by and large full of normal guys so how often can it really happen?

But if a dude has never talked to a woman about it? I do think they're likely in the dark, since the creeper men by and large don't do their creepy business in front of other men. I don't think it's a matter of not taking it seriously (at least not for regular, decent men). It's more an issue that they just don't know that it happens *so much*."
"Finding out you have no connection once u meet them and still having to go through the event. (The first date) Online dating is the worst for this. 

Also, dating in general is very nerve racking for me if I'm genuinely interested in the person because i don't know if they're talking to other people, or if we are 'serious' as in is he just having fun or does he genuinely  like me too? "
Ayy girl is anxiety a state?
"Any ""rules"" that parties/popular culture insist on adhering to. Like the old fashioned ""wait three days to call so you don't seem desperate or come on too strong"" rule. Now I suppose it's been updated for texting, but I still think it's a waste of everyone's time.

I went on a handful of dates that I'd met on the internet. It's way easier for everyone involved if we're just more forthcoming with how we feel. At the end of my first date with the man I'll be marrying in two weeks, I told him I'd like to see him again. It cleared the air and we didn't have to worry about when was the right time to call or text. I can't explain how much better I felt after that date than on any number of the ones before in which I had to sit around guessing whether or not that person ever wanted to hear from me again all the while knowing that the other person could very well be sitting around guessing about how I felt, too.

It's dumb. We're adults, we can talk about our feelings and not waste anyone's time."

"On the flip coin of this, how after you reach your late twenties you suddenly realise you're not getting harassed as much or as grossly, and you get that sinking feeling in your stomach that they were indeed actively looking for 12-15 year old girls to harass. There was never an accident. I wasn't mature for my age. I was little, and they wanted that. "

"I broke up with my ex after dating him for 9 years and decided that I wanted to stay single for a long time, date people but nothing serious, and figure out what I wanted. The very first date I went on was amazing, but I wasn't ready to get into a relationship and he said the same thing so we kept seeing each other casually. Three months later, I went on a solo 3-week trip and decided to give this relationship a serious chance. As soon as I got back and told him, he revealed that he hadn't been seeing anyone else and was waiting for me to be ready for something more serious. That was over 5 years ago and we've been married for a year now. Telling that story still makes me smile :)"
That we all hate each other. Who comes up with this stuff?!
"I remember being told by my female friends that when we were in the fourth grade, one of my good friends was raped, and that the girls had a big meeting on rape while we a ""boys field trip."" The meeting was basically to explain the girls needed to support our classmate because little things might bring back a rush of emotion.  

They kept this from all the boys for years. When I finally found out and heard the whole story I was completely baffled. I literally did not understand such a thing could happen without the world blowing up. "
"I was 21 and had been casually seeing a guy (who was soon to move overseas) for ~4 months when I fould out I was pregnant. He suggested termination, I slept on it, and then I told him that I was going to go ahead with it. 

I very strongly felt that it was my decision and my responsibility and I had no intention of forcing him to be a parent, so I suggested that given his feelings he should continue with his plans and that I would simply put unknown on the birth certificate when the time came. I did not push him at all and made it clear I would seek no money or anything from him.

He slept on it. The next day he came to me and said ""look, we can't do that. One way or another, I want to be involved. So, maybe I go away and you parent and in 20 years that child will have had a single mum and a dad who loves him but doesn't see him enough. OR, we can have a go at it. The worst that could happen is that it doesn't work and we break up, and in 20 years that child will have had a single mum and a dad who loves him but doesn't see him enough. We literally have nothing to lose!""

"I live in a busy downtown area.

"My friend was seeing this guy for a while off and on.  It was mostly a booty call for both of them.  But she ended up moving across the country for a job.  She came home to visit the family around the holidays, hooked up with him one night and got pregnant.  

He wanted nothing to do with the whole thing.  He basically told her he was not into being a parent.  Which was fine with her.  She did consult with a lawyer about putting him on the birth certificate if she ever needed child support or health care for the kiddo.  Basically the down side of that is if she ever passes away this child has to go to a person that wanted nothing to do with her.  She's fortunate enough to have a career that can support her and the baby without needing a second income.  

My friend opted to not have him on the birth certificate and just raise the baby herself.  She's got a great support group of friends and family that help out all the time.  I don't think it's easy by any means, but I know she is happy with her decision.  

The father has never seen the child, nor does he want to.  "
"A book.

I was reading ""Fangirl"" (which is an awesome book, by the way), and there's a part in there where she's at college and talks about how she doesn't want to go to the cafeteria because she doesn't know where to sit, where to go, what to do, how it works, etc. So she just, doesn't ever go. 

And suddenly it clicked in my brain that I have done that in many situations and *that isn't normal.* I guess it just never really occurred to me that not everybody had that anxiety, and that I don't have to live like that. So eventually I managed to get a therapist and she helped me so, so much. "

How often you'd have to think about personal safety is something that's seen as surprising a lot.
"I actually had this happen with my own husband. I want to add he is actually very caring and considerate; this is just a situation which made it very clear to me that he was very unfamiliar with what it feels like to be harassed or made to feel uncomfortable by male attention. 

We had bought a washer and had it delivered, and I provided my number so they could call me when they were on their way. Delivery came, all went well, neither delivery man made me feel uncomfortable. Then after they left, I start getting texts from one of them telling me how beautiful I was and I just deserved to know, etc. It was so inappropriate, and I immediately thought ""If he doesn't understand how inappropriate this is, what other boundaries does he not understand and/or care about?"" I also want to add, I live alone with my child about 80% of the time; my husband works out of state for that time. The delivery man knew that my husband works out of town a lot because he asked if I would need it hooked up and I said ""Yes, my husband won't be back to help for a few days."" (that was dumb on my part, I know.) So I have a delivery person that pushes boundaries, hits on women he knows are married, knows where I live, knows that my husband is going to be out of town for awhile yet....And I was thoroughly freaked out. I texted screenshots of this to my husband and told him I was reporting it to the place we got our washer from and I just wanted him to know what was going on. His first response was ""Aww, you have a secret admirer. ;) It must make you feel good to know that guys think that about you."" And while I understand why he could think that... No, sweetie. Just no. It's inappropriate. I gave him my number to provide me a service, and he used it in a way I did not consent to. Granted he probably did not have any super nefarious intentions in mind. But I don't know that. All I know is he knows my number, he knows where I live, he knows I'm alone for several days at a time including the present, and he's shown me he's not afraid to push boundaries. 

I can understand why my husband didn't get it... He's huge, and strong, and tough looking. No one is fucking with him, and if they did he is confident in his abilities to hold his own and get away to safety. He meant well, because in his mind someone hitting on me = I'm beautiful and should feel good about that. This all just goes to show how your average guy just does not understand the plight of your average girl against creepers. My own husband did not understand how scary that was to me until I explained it to him, so it's bound to be even worse for random guys to understand the fears of random girls they don't even know. "

Guys coming up to us while we're dancing and grab both of us, guys telling us how sexy we are, guys asking what kind of sex we have, etc. etc. etc. It's just so fucked up on so many levels because when I was with a guy, obviously we never had men coming up to us asking these questions. "
"I actually just thought of this one today: that super awkward/awful moment the first time a younger male relative says something sexist to you or about women in general. You're looking at a 5 year old like ""Oh god, it's started already..."" then you start looking at his dad differently...

Have had this occur more than once and it's very unfortunate. "
"""sticking your dick in crazy""

This reminds me of some old school freudian notion that women are ""hysterical"" and men are the only ones with any sense. It's also incredibly objectifying.

"Splurge on the photographer and food (some alcohol too if it works for y'all). Food because that's what everyone will really remember, and photographer because you want quality pics.

Don't go all out for fancy stationary. Please tell me of all the save the dates and invites you have saved or are memorable. Same with the ceremony programs.

Don't worry about super small details. Like all those Pinterest boards that have ridiculous centerpieces with little knick-knacks. Not that everything needs to be barren, you just don't need to go overboard. From the weddings I've been to, all I can remember was ""there was flowers and candles"".

Dont spend large amounts of money on little details; like a customized ring pillow/box. Don't go crazy on wedding shoes, especially if they can't be reworn in a new outfit or won't be seen at all.

Use flowers that are in-season or are very hardy. That'll save money

"Yup, guy here. For the last year I've lived with two women and a couple of my best friends are now women. I definitely didn't realize how frequently it occurs. Literally two nights ago for example, this guy who went out with my roommate tried to take advantage of her after a few drinks. The other roommate was assaulted at a bar recently. My two friends deal with creepy guys constantly trying to get in their pants. WTF you guys, how do you sleep at night doing this shit to other people? One of my friends just told me she likes grabbing drinks with me because guys leave her alone since I can look intimidating. It shouldn't take another man for that to be the case.

So, to any skeptical guys out there thinking ""well *I* would never do that, so I can't imagine it happens much."" It does. A LOT. "

* The worst stuff happens when you're alone, so most men don't even witness it. 

* They have a hard time understanding the physical intimidation. Like a fight between most adult women and the average 14 year old boy wouldn't even be fair. We all know that and it factors when you're dealing with a creep.

"That life isn't all sunshine and roses because you're a woman.

"When I was small, I honestly thought adults do not have friendships. There were lots of visits from aunts and uncles, and I knew my mom's coworkers. But there were never people around who were just friends of mum and dad. So somehow I assumed as a kid you have friends, as a grownup you have family.

We have a lot of different ideas about child-rearing, muddled by our political views (which are similar, surprisingly, or at least were until they went full patriarchal on me) and racial backgrounds (brown people, but he really wants me to move to a safer country because our child will be black and Middle Eastern, and he thinks that's a bad combo for living in a Trump America.) But we Skype once a week to get to know each other better and we're figuring it out.

It's hard, but I've had a physically easy pregnancy so far and though  don't have close family I have good friends. Work is super awkward - most of my co-workers are very religious, but never ask me about my pregnancy as I'm unmarried. And it's actually kinda hurtful because another co-worker is a week further along than me and she gets asked about her health and the baby all the time but nope. Ignore ignore ignore.

I decided to keep the baby because, ultimately, I'm pro-choice but couldn't choose abortion for myself. And though it's a scary time to be a brown person in America I didn't want fear to stop me from imagining a better future for my child and others.

EDIT: OMGG, please stop with the vaguely Islamaphobic questions, concerns, and advice! He's fucking Greek Orthodox but your racism is showing thanxxx."

I'm severely disappointed by the lack of pictures in this thread.
"Hi! My baby is eight weeks old and he was conceived with a casual partner. We had been dating exclusively but casually for five months when we got pregnant. We were also long distance and two weeks after I got pregnant (unaware that I was) we decided to end things because of the distance (six hours drive). I found out I was pregnant three weeks later. I called him and told him. We've been together again ever since that phone call. We moved in together. He helped me through pregnancy and he was there when our gorgeous son was born. We are saving to buy a house together. He's helping me set up my own company. But most importantly, he is an amazing father. He loves our boy so much, and he helps out with nappies and feeding (I combination feed as he's just a really really hungry baby). He's teaching me how to drive, he gets up during the night with me if there's a problem with feeding. We still have an incredible sex life, it was amazing during pregnancy and afterwards too.... It seems to have really worked out for us. I hope it lasts. "

"Only if he includes a bit about how his whole life and all his history (racially motivated discrimination in housing, etc etc) has been a demonstration and experiment in just how far our country and culture will allow a rich person to move beyond the reach of the law and outside moral boundaries, and that he is now prepared to provide a full report on the topic, undo all effects of any benefits he earned by his actions, and make moves to prevent anyone else being able to behave in even 1/10 the awful manner that his entire life has been."
"There is a certain bias dealing with women who exist and talk within a group. Men who were asked the percentage of women in a group answered ""about 50%"" when in reality it was actually less than 20%. They also answered that there were more women than men in the room when the number of women approached 50%.  
There is a similar trend with speaking-- even though a woman may only speak 25% of the time, others will say that she is taking an equal amount or even dominating the conversation.

Anecdotally, you can look at peoples reactions to certain things, like the demographics of people (not just women) on a committee: if you have a committee that is half women, or half black people, you get people complaining about some kind of agenda or ""they must have been chosen because they were x"", whereas a group full of white dudes is commonplace and people don't get suspicious about it."

"That ""get laid whenever you want"" thing is so dumb. Like yes I almost certainly could find a total random who would agree to stick his dick in me, now let me blow your mind by explaining that the definition of ""desirable sexual experience"" doesn't actually start and end with ""male pleasure"". (And the ridiculous part is that I KNOW some idiot reading this is going to be thinking ""oh, look at Miss Privileged Princess wanting ~desirable~ sexual experiences! Sex is like pizza! Even when it's bad it's good!"" And I just don't think I'm going to be able to explain to him that vaginas are actually very sensitive body parts attached living breathing humans, and consequently they have nerve ending and delicate tissues that are easy to hurt and injure, sometimes quite seriously, and not magical static sex holes the gates of which are jealously guarded by what is, when you get right down to it, a pair of tits and an arse on legs.

"I'm in my 30s and I think it was mid 20s I realized the type of guy that was making lewd comments when I was under 14 seemed to disappear. Other guys making lewd comments replaced them, but there was a tone, a way the words often played on ""little girl"" that stopped as I hit legal age. It's a horrifying thought that so many were specifically targeting kids and tweens. Horrifying and scary. "
"I think what bothers me more is when women themselves perpetuate that. I don't see it as much now that I'm older, but my teenage best friend was adamant that outside of me (I was very tomboyish then) she just couldn't be friends with other girls, because they were *drama*.

Naturally I eventually learned that the only dramatic chick I knew was her :/"
"I have just the dumbest sense of humor. Seriously stupid. The worst puns. Actually, [this picture](https://imgur.com/zw17nNs) perfectly captured my humor vs. my husband's. 

And the thing is, when I tell him a joke like that, the degree to which he hates it is directly related to how funny I find it. He'll sit there going ""I hate you. I hate you so much"", while I cry with laughter. "
"That women expect men to pay for everything. I constantly hear men complain about this, yet I have been *physically prevented from paying*--on multiple dates--when I pull out my share.

Men, there is no scenario in which I will be impressed by how much money you have. And if your intentions aren't arrogant, well, the harder you insist on paying, the more you're suggesting to me that you think me unable to financially support myself."
"I had a student go off on one at me because I asked her to stop talking during a lesson. She called me pretty much every name under the sun, roaring at me that even though I was really old I wasn't her mother, that I was ugly and stupid and the worst teacher ever, that no one respected me, and so on. She refused to leave the class, and went on like this for about ten minutes without pause. It was exhausting just listening to her tirade, and not yelling something horrible at her. When the deputy head had finally been to remove her, the rest of the class were in shock at how rude she was. 
Another student threatened to murder me, and I took that shit seriously as he'd already got his older brother to murder someone on his behalf. That was a pretty rough school to work in!"
The fact that people were shocked and appalled by Truno saying powerful men could assault women without consequence. 
"Other than what you've pointed out, if only it were just validation ""that you're attractive"" - When I was younger I was yelled at/hounded by men who wanted to tell me exactly how sexually *un*appealing I am probably more than the opposite. They're both still bad of course.

I've explained this to my husband and my guy friends and they all seem to accept it (perhaps because we're all around 30 now so I feel we're on the older side on average compared to reddit) - it has felt like ever since I was about the age of 10/11 a certain type of man has decided they have the right to tell me what my appearance makes them think. And ok on the positive side I can get why men, who aren't approached as often, think ""I'd be flattered"" but I remember how utterly exhausting it felt in my late teens/early 20s walking past a group of men of all ages and demographics and wondering if I was going to be let off that day from having anything directed at me. Sometimes we just want to stay in our own little world without being bothered by anyone. There seems to be this attitude that women always want attention otherwise idk, we'll dry up and die or something. No, I'm good not getting any attention from other random humans some days.

"Multiple times in my life, I've felt shattered when losing a boyfriend. Like, gut wrenching sobs crying and I would have sworn my heart physically hurt. I thought the world was ending, I'd never be that happy with someone else, I had no more love to give, I can't love anyone as fully again. 

And every single time, I'm proven wrong. Every single time, I found myself able to move on and be happy either alone or with someone else when the time was right. I have a much healthier few of relationships now because I've suffered heartbreak so many times. I know no matter what, it'll be ok. So I don't suffer as much now when something good ends.

I've discovered I'm someone who will never run out of love to give. I find my heart is always willing to give itself fully to someone if they deserve it, even though in the throes of heartbreak it doesn't seem possible. You'll be ok! Another one will come along who will want to make you happy and you will find you're able to love her just as much as the last girl."

It's mentally exhausting and a jolt to the system when a male family member or close friends says something so sexist that you are left wondering if you even know this preson.

"I live with my homebody best friend and two cats. I'm never lonely.

I don't have many friends for a few reasons, I guess. I'm an introvert and don't particularly like socializing with strangers, which translate to not meeting a lot of people. And I prefer close friendships which not everyone is open to and which takes a certain level of ""chemistry"" to build, so my options are limited as is my time (since I'm spending it being close to the friends I do have). Group hangouts can be fun on occasion, but I find them exhausting by the end of it, so I wouldn't wanna do it often, so I'm not exactly in need of a lot of friends."

"My mom got pregnant from a one-night-stand at 16. This was even more of a scandal in a small town in the 70s than it would have been today, but she decided to keep the baby. Her mother supported her and helped raise my sister for the first couple of years. People were really judgy and gave my mom and sister a hard time. When my sister was four my mom met my dad and he helped raise my sister from then on and they moved to a big city where the precise circumstances of my sister's birth didn't interest anyone. The bio-dad paid child-support but my sister only met him when she was 16 and didn't like him. They never formed a relationship. When my dad officially adopted my sister 10 years ago (mom's dying wish) we couldn't even find the bio-dad. 

Our mother never regretted it. My sister has some issues, which I think might partially stem from our grandma's attempts at raising her (gran's a bit of a narcissist) and from the town being so judgy. But she certainly found a good dad. Our relationship can be a bit weird due to a 22-year age gap, but most of the time we get along fine. "

He was a young, corn fed lad with a beat up truck and a simple dream of getting some gas and heading back out on the road. He hands me his money, I turn to ring him up, glance back at him and notice that he is staring at my phone with a look of abject horror.

I look at my phone. There is a gif of a guy getting absolutely plowed in the ass, rammed, anally annihilated. I have no idea what to do, I finish ringing him up, we make no eye contact at all for the remaining duration of the transaction, and he nearly sprints back to his truck.

I have never been so embarrassed in my life. He still comes and gets gas now and then and every time, it's just as terrible as you would imagine.

"That's fucking horrible I am so sorry. I'm sorry that your sister died, and I am even more sorry that that is your mother. I will never understand why people say the shit they say, and do the things they do. Words, just as much as actions, have an effect on people. I am so sorry."

"They would pick a man who holds all the same theological views that they hold, holds all the political and social views they hold, comes from a conservative Christian family, wants a quiverful life, who follows and expects traditional gender roles, stocky build, at least average height, brown hair, blue eyes, skin like milk, traditionally masculine interests, clean cut and older than me by at least a few years. Why? That's the sort of man my mother wanted me to marry and urged me to leave my husband for upon more than one occasion. My father merely latches onto how I married a man who was not of god and then silently broods, even though I left my faith before I met my husband. My husband might actually be the anti-Christ in her mind although his kind and gentle character has slowly won her over in spite of herself. My parents will still launch into bitter, angry soliloquies for me marrying someone who is mostly the opposite of all those things. "
"Having to ignore messages on social media from horny men that I do not know. I'll be grossed out for the rest of the day.

Not being able to open that pickle jar by myself...

The fact that, because I'm blonde and cheerful everyone assumes I'm stupid. When in reality I'm one of the top 30 students with the highest GPA in my entire college. Still get dumb blonde jokes.

The unspoken female rivalry when I meet a girl that is hotter than me.

Not being able to reach the top shelf.

"My son is 7. I'm very mindful of how I word things, but kids pick up stuff at school. Usually if the ""that's not for girls"" comes out I'm the one that says ""hey, but mommy likes this and I know at least five girls in your class that do too.""  The other day we were all watching something on TV and one of the female characters went to do something, don't recall what. My son says ""but girls don't do X"" and before I could even launch into my sure they can thing, my husband flat out turns to our son and says ""that's a sexist thing to say and they absolutely can.""  And my heart grew four sizes that evening. The fact that he picks it up from school so young is disheartening, but I try to see those moments as ""teachable moments"" if nothing else. "

I also wish I had skipped the paper lanterns and handmade tissue paper pomanders - they didn't match my vision and weren't nearly as endearing as the garage-sale-vase centerpieces we put together. "

"The pressure to actually have feelings for a guy who shows a lot of interest in you, when you have zero attraction to them. The whole ""aww come on, give him a chance!!"" thing.

"I was playing a computer game with my then 6 year old male cousin and we got to a fairly high level when suddenly he says ""OK I have to play this level now because it's too scary for girls to play"". I'm looking at him like wtf and he continues ""It's too tricky for girls"". I calmly explained to him I was (then) 19 years old and he kind of caught on that kids don't tell adults what to do and he went ""Oh yeah, I forgot"", so I just explained girls can play scary games too. 

My then 10 year old stepbrother also had to be told to stop complaining every time he saw a woman driving a car he liked. When we later saw my stepdad complaining about a female sports reporter, we realised where he got it from. "

My boyfriend has the exact same laptop, requires the exact same charger and when *he* went into the store to buy it, it was 6e. I went back, grumpy, and asked why and the guy got embarrassed and told me they up the price for women because they assume I don't know what the charger is actually worth. I got my money back but I was fuming. It's an ongoing saga of me vs tech people though."

I dislike the surprisingly prevalent idea that women are just being weak or precious or malingering, or that they should just ""tough it out"" because it's ""not that bad"".  For some women, it really **is** that bad, and they'd *much* rather be well enough to work than to be in such misery."
"My parents have literally said this to me.  I was all down on myself for not having many friends after we all graduated college and none of my high school friends came back to our home state, and my mom was like ""don't worry, when you get to be our age nobody has friends because you have your family!""  Now almost 10 years later, I'm 90% certain I don't want kids and doubtful that I want to get married again, so if I were to believe in what my mom told me (clearly I don't), where does that leave me?!

My parents always really wanted to set me up with one of the two rich white guys they knew around my age, and the one who isn't Walt just got married, so that leaves Walt. I have no idea if we'd even get along, maybe it wouldn't be that bad, but his parents make me twitchy."

Its easy to convince yourself of anything, including dismissing signals of interest simply because you think no one could possibly want you.

At the end of every Pingu episode they threw up the Province du Québec logo. And since I couldn't understand Pingu, and knew that Québec was where they spoke French, I just assumed for *years* that Pingu was in French. "

"About 6 months before the wedding, he called it off. We had booked various things, but nothing too onerous as my mother was the florist, it was at a club my parents belonged to, we did our own invitations by hand, etc. He was in the Navy, and thought getting married was something he ""should do"" (military really puts the screws to ya to get hitched and have kids to keep you enlisted/dependent), and we were in love so we got engaged. But as the date grew closer, he realized it wasn't what he wanted, and since he was leaving for a three month Gulf tour just prior to the wedding, he felt he needed to call it off before he went. It was rough. He said he wanted to stay together and not get married yet. He wrote a letter to my parents apologizing, even. It was very sweet. Then he broke up with me for good the morning he was leaving for his tour. I drove him to the docks and never saw him face-to-face again.

After dropping him off I went in to work where I was an office manager and was covering the reception desk. About an hour later, a man walked in for his first day of work there. I have been blissfully married to him now for 17 years. 

My wedding being called off, and subsequent break-up, was the gateway to literally the best thing that ever happened to me: my amazing husband.

"Sort of related. This weekend some lady came knocking on our apartment door about 12:30 am. My husband went to answer, talked to her, she ended up being at the wrong apartment. When my husband got back to the living room I told him I never would have answered the door if I was home alone. And he was very confused and thought it was rude of me not to answer the door. I explained to him as a woman who, in all honesty, could be over powered (I'm 5'2"" and 100lbs) I prefer to not answer the door after a certain hour. These are just things I think about where as the thought never crossed his mind."

I don't want a relationship right now, I'm not in the right place, and such. The only thing they said that actually seemed to be true is when they brought up how they weren't over their ex or that they weren't that attracted to me, which is fine of course. But the rest of them.. Like, dude, it's okay if you just wanna bang with no strings attached. I JUST TOLD YOU I didn't want anything serious either and now you've gone on and ruined perfectly good sex because you think all girls secretly fall in love with you and will want to get married and have babies.

"From an older point of view, how little people care about you once you get past the child bearing years. Sometimes I feel like I have just been put out to pasture to die. From a medical standpoint, everything is blamed on menopause and not much can be done about it. If I try to explain myself to anyone, they just tell me it is something I have to deal with.  It really sucks. I seem to remind everyone of their mother or grandmother and for some reason younger people have no problems telling me that. I wouldn't mind it so much, but they always seem to say it and then realize that they *might* have been insulting which just makes me sad because it wasn't insulting until they thought it might be.  They were just telling me I look like someone they love--but it is an insult to say someone looks older. 

For women, their usefulness seems to pretty much end after their childbearing years are over.  They then just become a grumpy old woman who is just poo pooed off when they have something to say."
Yes. He called me meat curtains. I didn't see him after that. 
Damn and I'm sure it's equally annoying for bi women because for some reason guys think bi = willingness to have a threesome. I mean if everyone is a consensual adult go for it. But bi doesn't  mean you ask for a threesome thinking you're getting one 
"Haha yes!! This is what made me ask.  
I just got glasses and the new HD vision has been seriously enlightening. Had no idea that my toes were so hairy or that this was a thing until a couple days ago."
That's the only way my guy will let me have a threesome. Not opposed to it. 
"I would not if the name were so well known or unusual that my child's name would be commented on continuously. No Zaphod or Frodo, for example. Probably not even something like ""Scout"" or ""Hermione.""

I also wouldn't if the character were from something of poor quality and temporary popularity. Or at least I wouldn't reveal where the name came from later on. ""Yes, sorry Bella and Edward, I did name you after characters in bad teen romance novels."" Of course we've also got an implication of incest there- Isabella alone is a perfectly lovely name. 

But I'd be open to considering names like Lyra or Jane. "

"I think part of this is so normalised in our lives, that when I get harassed (which on a good week only happens once, by the way) I don't even think to tell anyone. All my female friends are the same. As an illustration of this, I don't know a single woman who *hasn't* been followed home by a stranger. It has happened to me so often, I have lost count. I can't even remember the first time because it has happened so many times, they all bleed together. 

Not to mention that, people's reactions are so blasé when you tell them, that it doesn't even seem worth it, and it's just such a regular occurrence it gets tiring having to talk about it all the time. But that's part of the problem. Most guys don't realise how frequent it is, because it never gets talked about. So when a woman talks about being harassed, they can brush it aside as a one time thing. They're not outrage or horrified, because they can chalk it up some weird pervert and move on. And when you tell other women their reactions are sympathetic, but usually result in a swapping of stories. They aren't outraged either, because this isn't out of the norm for them.

It just isn't really worth it to talk about, and so we don't. So men don't realise the extent to which harassment happens, and then, in some cases, feel like women are overreacting to certain scenarios, not realising that while this might be the first story they've heard, this is that woman's 15th, or 20th similar experience. Which, unfortunately, only continues the cycle of women not talking about it, because we find that when we do, we're met with disbelief or aggression - #NotAllMen being a prime example."

"Perspective: non-US citizen but US resident who is (by US standards) very far left of center. 

I found that neither of them answered questions face-on, but that Trump did far less so than Clinton. With Clinton, I have a reasonable idea of what course she intends to take, whereas Trump can only state that things are 'a disaster' and not come back with an actual proposal.

Both of them made things rather personal, which I am not in favor of, but Trump did so  far more and in a way that is disingenuously broad. I also am very annoyed that Clinton keeps being charged with what her husband may or may not have done. Trump hammered on that a lot and it seems like a cheap point-scoring technique. To me, this makes him seem weak, but I think many will gladly blame her for Bill's policies.

I caught Trump in a distinct number of falsehoods and misrepresentations. I did not catch Clinton in any. 

As a whole, I doubt the genuineness of Clinton's rhetoric of unity - she's far too corporate and far too hawkish for my tastes, but she strikes me as competent and stable. Not a great president by any means, but also not an awful one. 

Trump makes no secret of his platform being based on exclusion of a wide variety of people (he may not have _called_ them deplorables, but his proposed actions speak the truth quite clearly) and, in that sense, on hate. I think he lacks the ability to control his ego and be diplomatic in the face of complicated and charged situations in which there is no right answer. He strikes me as a highly dangerous choice who will open us up to all sorts of diplomatic incidents.

Edit: fixed a crooked sentence."
"I stared at him lustfully for over a year. He literally talked to everyone... but me. Wouldn't even so much as give me a glance. I told my gym bro that I was going to talk to him because what did I have to lose. I am a single mother in my twenties. The odds were stacked against me anyways.

One Friday he was sitting alone (finally) on the bench and it took literally everything I had to get the nerves to talk to him. My opening line, you ask?

""so. how much you bench?"" 
his response?
""a lot."" 

We talked for about 60 seconds after that and I turned to leave, slightly mortified about my opener. As i turn, I hear, ""it's always nice when a pretty women takes notice. What's your name?""

It's been almost 2 years of us dating and living together. He said he never dreamed that his ""dream girl"" (his words) would have ever wanted to talk to him let alone date him. I have bigger balls than him! "

"We had only been dating about a month and weren't even exclusive. I had a girls' date for Valentine's Day. He asked if he could come after. And he showed up with a dozen red roses and champagne. 

I am 28 and it was the first time I got Valentine's flowers.

That was one of my favorite big things. The little things are so sweet too. He occasionally has a random present for me ""just because"". Like a tea sampler kit because I love iced tea. Or he still regularly asks to take me out on a date.

And oh! He's taking me to the ballet next week. I love ballet!"
"Because I'm an ""ice queen.""  THE COLD NEVER BOTHERED ME ANYWAY."
"Something that's super pervasive and hurtful is the Welfare Queen stereotype. It's pretty common to hear awful comments, not just on FB or Twitter but IRL, anytime a black woman is mentioned in the news who is not a celebrity or rich. I get so annoyed. 

Also echoing others in this thread, that women hate each other or are inherently catty. I can't stand people, women included, who brag about not having female friends because they ""hate drama"" or ""aren't catty."" I always feel like, SUUUUURE, that's why you don't have any girl friends! Suprisingly enough 
(/s), women can be very kind and honest, and men can also be extremely dramatic and shit-stirrers. This is particularly annoying at work because I work in an office environment and as someone who is a bit higher up in the chain than the entry and privy to some hiring practices, it's super frustrating that potential women new-hires are so much more scrutinized for their possibility of bringing drama, when they haven't done anything to earn that stigma. People legitimately hire men over women sometimes because they rationalize it as a ""better fit for the team"" based on this stereotype, without any actual evidence of it."
"I mean, it wasn't shitty when I got it. 

It's a little stick figure drawing of my best friend and I that we got on our 20th friendiversary. We've been friends since we were both about 1 year old. 

It's shitty now because she turned out to be a disgusting human being who stole a bunch of money and possessions from me, our roommates, her boyfriend, some of our other friends and whoever the hell else for who knows how long.

Needless to say, we no longer speak and I need a cover up. Bad."
"My granddad disapproved SO HARD when my cousin introduced her then-boyfriend to the family. Because his ancestors were businesspeople and ours were farmers, so he's _not good enough_ to marry into the family. Caste system is fucking stupid."
"I told my ex-best friend that I was feeling really depressed and suicidal, and he responded with ""Is there anything I can do to help?"", as in ""Is there anything I can do to help make it happen?"". Was not expecting a response like that..."
Can you explain the link between your family and rim jobs? I'm a bit lost.

"But you didn't say,  are you happily married? "
"I was going to put the same thing. Guys don't really seem all that interested in me and even if they were, I'm super shy and still a little self-conscious about my body and my looks. "
"I heard a guy recently say ""now we look like a normal quantitative lab"" when all the female lab members coincidentally were not going to lunch with the group.

Anytime someone has said a compliment and then felt the need to tack on ""for a girl"". If gender has no part of a skill or activity, it shouldn't be commented on. ""Good female scientist"" is not the same as ""good scientist, who happens to be a woman"" and the difference can be heard and felt.

I hold the door open for guys who will grab the door from me and refuse to walk in until I do, which means I have to duck under their arm. I have never seen this happen to a dude, though I'm waiting because that shit will be hilarious.

Hilary's campaign has brought out a lot of subtle and not so subtle sexist comments, but politics are more polarizing than I want to get into.

Implicit bias colors pretty much everything everyone does. I think if you're genuinely concerned, maybe you should approach a close female friend and say something like ""I'm working on catching and correcting any subtly sexist habits I've picked up, could you do me a favor and point them out when you notice one?"" and see what she says."
"My dad's a hardcore conspiracy theorist and pushed all of that onto me growing up. After I went away to college and spent some time away from him I was able to think for myself a little more, and eventually it became clear that it was all a bunch of bullshit. I think deep down I always knew that this stuff wasn't true, but conspiracy theorists have this dangerous idea that believing the opposite of what's conventionally accepted means you're enlightened, and that only they know the ""truth."" It's a very cult-like way of thinking. 

I just got my flu shot a few weeks ago and got my tetanus booster a couple months ago. I'm still alive and do not have autism, miraculously. "
"I think he's a vile garbage person who is unfit to lead. Those comments are just part of why. He's a danger to women and he's making other dangerous men feel justified in their behavior. 

Also I don't understand how men think they're helping by saying ""all men talk like that."" because they're damn sure quick to scream not all men when women complain about men behaving this way. "
"Not counting the hateful stuff I get from being a moderator on a woman's sub, either:

""We aren't going to break up because no one will ever love you if I go."" from an ex.

or

""I wasted 5 years being friends with a lying dyke cunt."" from a ""friend,"" three days after I came out."

"I guess I have a lot, honestly. Here are a few of the important ones. 

* I am personally responsible for any choices I make. Other people cannot obligate me without my consent. 
* I make my choices in line with my ethical code. 
* Do not judge myself in hindsight for things I did not know/could not do at the time. 
* Do not hold the actions of other people against different individuals. 
* Do not shield other people from making their own choices and being personally responsible for their own actions. 
* Always tell those I love how I feel about them. 
* Never be intentionally mean or cruel. 
* Never compromise on deal-breakers. 
* My thoughts, feelings, and actions are also my personal responsibility. "

"i consider myself super unflexible but strangely i've never had a problem with this. i reach behind my waist and zip it up as far as i possibly can, then reach one arm behind me over the shoulder to the back, and assist with the other hand around the small of my back to zip it up. 

if i'm struggling with the top, it can help to pull the dress far enough up to where i can zip it with my bent-behind-over-the-shoulder hand, and the wiggle it back down."
"I just got dumped.  The night after my birthday in fact.  

I'm so,  so,  deeply sorry.  I wish there was something someone else could have done or said to make me feel better, to even take a small sliver of my pain away.  Unfortunately the only thing that will help is time, and I know that it feels like an eternity away. I know that was the last thing I wanted to hear when I was hurting. Time feels like it's an eternity.  Seconds feel like minutes, minutes feel like hours,  and hours feel like days.  The future where you feel normal again feels so distant that you won't ever live long enough to see it.  Your routine is gone, you don't know what to do with yourself.  Your every day life is now different,  stripped away from you.  

I was madly in love with my boyfriend.  I even moved 1,000km (600 miles) to another province for him.  I quit my job,  I moved out of my beloved home of 5 years, sold all my possessions I couldn't fit inside my car...  I was ready to do anything for him.  We were together for two years. We had been making plans to travel the country for 3 months then move back to British Columbia together.  

Out of the blue at 1am the day after my birthday, I got a phone call from him.  He no longer wanted to be with me.  He had no reasons for me as to why.  Only that he had to do this travelling on his own,  he didn't want me around for it.  I was crushed.  My entire world fell down around me.  I couldn't eat,  I couldn't sleep.  I cried every day until I actually started getting sores near my eyes from the irritation of the tears and wiping them away.  I lost almost 20 pounds in two weeks because I couldn't keep anything more than a cup of water a day in my stomach without throwing up.  

I was lost.  I didn't know what to do.  I honestly didn't feel like I was ever going to feel normal again. I stayed in my room with the blinds drawn not even having the energy to get out of bed. I just floated through life.  Not caring,  trying not to feel anything.  Any time something popped up in Facebook,  I'd start bawling again.  I got a friend to log into my Facebook for me.  Delete and remove all the pictures and posts he was tagged in.  I blocked him just so I wouldn't have to see his comments or posts even.  All I wanted was to feel normal again.  I can honestly say it took me about 2 months before I even began to start feeling normal.  

I've always been one to keep my pain to myself.  Hide it.  Pretend nothing is wrong.  This time...  I forced myself to be open to my friends closest to me.  It really helped.  I just didn't want to be left alone, but neither did I want to leave my bed either.  They were instrumental in helping me.  Coming over to my house and forcing me to get out of bed.  Even something as simple as walking together around the cul-de-sac really started to help.  There wasn't much small talk,  but even just having the presence of another human being next to me was comforting.  

I hated doing it, but I started forcing myself to restart doing the things I enjoyed doing before my ex. Forcing myself to go through the motions of my every day life before him, in the hopes that eventually I'd begin to feel some sort of normalcy.  One of them being rock climbing.  I literally had to force myself out the door every day. There was another fellow there at the climbing centre,  and we made small talk,  he was really interesting. Rock climbing is more fun in a group,  and I saw him there a couple more times in the future.  We had met at the rock climbing gym a couple times and climbed together.  I was really only looking for friendship.  I wasn't looking for any sort of romantic relationship,  even the thought of flirting with someone felt like cheating on my ex, even through we weren't together anymore.  After a couple sessions of rock climbing,  we would sometimes end up going to grab lunch together after.  

It has slowly begun to evolve into something more.  

I was completely upfront with him about when and how I took the break up with my ex.  He's been amazingly understanding.  We've been moving forward slowly and both of us think there could be something really special here and both of us want to find out.  He is 4 years older than me,  very kind,  intelligent.  He just finished his engineering degree.  He has his shit together. The way he treats me makes me feel like a princess.  Not in a demeaning way,  but little things that make me feel very important.  Like a kiss on the side of the head while watching Netflix,  or a caress on my back in passing.  He is an amazing cook (used to be a chef)  and feeds me very well.  I didn't think that I would ever find someone more compatible than my ex and I,  and what I have with my current BF already pales in comparison and we're still quite new in our relationship.  

I hope that in some small way my words bring even a small amount of comfort to your day.. "

When I was young it was all about how mature I was, how cute I was, how understanding I was. Wow I was so special, like, he'd never met someone who could just get him you know, so what if I was 14, age is just a number when you understand the souls of each other. 

or they tried to scare me into giving them what they wanted. You did a bad thing online, better send me nudes or I'll send this to your mother. Whatever it was.

I'm in the UK, so I don't know if TJ Maxx's are doing this, but the TK Maxx's over here are selling packs of Korean face masks as well.  And there's something just utterly decadent about them.

So fancy soap, face masks, overly complicated coffee, weird snacks. With all of those, you could have quite the night."
"I became pregnant with my daughter with my boyfriend of a month. I was dating him casually, although we were exclusive. I thought he was just going to be a ""fun"" relationship and not be anything serious. I took a pregnancy test not because I thought I was pregnant, but because I just happened to find one and had that natural thought of ""Well, I don't *think* I'm pregnant but you can never be too sure."" To say it was a shock would be an understatement. I never wanted children and my first thought was having an abortion. I told my boyfriend and he was fine with the abortion idea but then I waivered a bit and decided not to. He was on board since he had always wanted children and apparently would have preferred I keep it. 

Our relationship was shit after that. I was living with him and he moved out to the couch because all we would do is fight. I wanted him to grow up and stop being a lazy do nothing and he wanted to go out and drink all the time. Basically we were maturing at different paces. I feel so bad for our old roommates looking back but at the time I just didn't care because we were going through some shit. It didn't help that I had an extreme case of hyperemesis gravidarum so I was vomiting a bare minimum of 10 times a day and kept ending up in the hospital with dehydration. My mood didn't improve with this.

We moved into our own place when I was about 7 months pregnant, I found out he had kissed some other girl and shit hit the fan. We finally worked out things, relationship-wise after our baby shower. One thing I have to say is that he never didn't care about our daughter. He would read anything I sent him, we would read the weekly updates together regardless of how we were doing personally, he worked to buy things for her, he was great in regards to her.

I told my friends and family right after we found out. 3 of our other friends were also pregnant so there was a little preggy tribe of us. They were all still going to the bar every night though and partying. Most didn't stop drinking or doing other things while pregnant and that just wasn't my scene so we lost touch. No one judged us for getting pregnant, until we stopped hanging out at the bar and hosting parties.

People weren't too judgey. I'm from New England and we live in Florida so I think I was more judging of *myself* than anyone was of me. It seems more the norm down here.

Overall it all worked out. I wouldn't trade my daughter for the world. She's a smart and beautiful little 2 year old now. My then boyfriend is now my husband. He got his shit together and is almost done with his degree in Homeland Security at a fantastic university and has great job prospects lined up. I was able to be a stay at home mom with our daughter and take care of my pre-existing medical issues. It all worked out. I love my husband more than anyone and we are amazing at communication now, which we really struggled with during my pregnancy."
"My friends and I have had conversations in the past of ""what we do to avoid getting raped/assaulted"". That's one of the things we'd have on our list, plus things like: 

- Crossing the street if it's night and there's a man/group of men walking towards you/behind you. 
- Locking your car door immediately when you get inside. 
- Taking the stairs instead of the elevator of there's a man/group of men waiting to take it, or not getting in an elevator if there's just a man/men in it. 
- Giving fake names to male strangers to ask when out at clubs/bars. Or pretending not to hear them/speak the same language.
- Having a taxi cab drop you off a block or two away from your house so they don't actually know where you live.

Etc... It's pretty normal, at least in my group of female friends, to live by some or all of these preventative measures. "
"A teenage boy is getting ready to take his girlfriend to the prom. First he goes to rent a tux, but there’s a long tux line at the shop and it takes forever.


Next, he has to get some flowers, so he heads over to the florist and there’s a huge flower line there. He waits forever but eventually gets the flowers.
Then he heads out to rent a limo. Unfortunately, there’s a large limo line at the rental office, but he’s patient and gets the job done.


Finally, the day of the prom comes. The two are dancing happily and his girlfriend is having a great time. When the song is over, she asks him to get her some punch, so he heads over to the punch table and comes right back. She say, ""Wow, that was fast!"" to which he responds, ""Yeah, there was no punch line."" "

So I'll prep this and give you a recap of my first date. I'm in a European country and I'm a biracial (half black/white) American female. Over the course of an hour and a half, this guy says:

* ""You're half White. Mulattas are always lighter than you. I have a female friend who's half-mozambique and her baby looks German. You're more black. It's okay, I like black girls""

* I was talking to my female friend and she said she gets horny when she drinks, so I bought her a bottle of wine. All women get horny when drinking.

* ""This country is letting too many foreigners in. Arabs and Turks are terrorists...not all of them, but still""

* Asians in America are really hard workers. They have integrated well.

* A Black man with a white woman only happens because he's rich right?

* You like heavy metal? But black people are supposed to like R&amp;B music

* you have a great body. Really big boobies 

* If Trump wins, he won't be able to do anything. Hilary is only a little bit better

I see my friends going through it too! My roommate dated my best friend and she was completely 100% upfront about literally everything, and he'd come to me saying 'Well, she says she wants [x], but I really know she wants [y]' and nothing I could do would convince him to actually listen to her. Then when they broke up, he literally said it was because he was tired of all the games and that he was too old for that, and was looking for somebody who knew what they wanted. Like she knew exactly what she wanted, dude. You just ignored her because you wanted her to be different."

I had a guy working at an oil change place steal my phone number after he changed my oil. I was friendly to him, but was sure to not flirt or anything because why would I? I wasn't interested... Anyway he texts me and starts telling me about how he has cancer and that he ""can't help but text the beautiful girls he meets now, when he has the opportunity because he doesn't know how much longer he has to live..."". A friend of a friend later told me that he was lying about having cancer (she knew him very well and her boyfriend was related to the guy), and that apparently he lied to women often in order for them to go out with him. He actually did guilt me enough into having dinner with him. About 2 minutes into the ""date"" I knew something was extremely ""off"" about him.  

Edit: I found out he was lying after I had already gone out with him, when I went to visit my friend at work to tell her about it. Her friend who knows the creep overheard and was like, ""omg are you talking about ____?!?!"". "
"Kind of divided. 

I try to take it as a compliment, but every time I hear someone say 'You're cute.' I feel like it basically translates to 'you're not visually unappealing, but you don't have any sex appeal.'

When family members say it, replace 'sex appeal' with 'putting enough effort into your appearance.' 

I don't know, maybe i'm just bitter about how often i'm called cute by people i'm attracted to. it's like a consolation prize. you're kind of left wondering what you're missing to get to that 'hot' category.

"The first actual cat call I recall I was 12 at a water park with my family (ETA, so I was wearing a one piece normal swimsuit like most girls in the park). Some guys high up a long ramp/line to get on a slide yelled down at me.

He screamed right in their terrified faces a lot of things at them in front of a huge crowd.

In an odd way is worked out because I learned right away not to back down or take shit if someone was cat calling me. Dad explained it all."
