You ever had a man sit you down and play a terrible song on a guitar and sing for you? I know his heart was in the right place but it was like 4 minutes of uninterrupted eye contact through AWFUL singing and guitar playing where I felt like I had to act like I was swooning the whole time. 
"In high school, I was pretty unattractive. All of my friends were soooo beautiful.

Anyways, I decided to skip school one day because we weren't doing anything. Me and my friend decided to walk to our friend's house from school, which was roughly a 20 minute walk. We had to be on the side of the road for a little while. After a good 10 minutes of walking, one of my friend's friends drives by and yells her name. They come back, ask where she's going, and offer her a ride. She gets in the car and as I approach it, her friend locks the door. 

I thought it was a joke at first, so I laughed and pulled on the handle. Her friend rolls down the window and says “I'm trying to unlock the doors, but my car doesn't like ugly people!” and pulls off.

I never saw my friend's reaction, but things were a lot different between us after that. I was too embarrassed to want to talk to her or anyone for the rest of the year. "
"I worked in an insurance office where they had a clerk who was mid-40s and weighed about 250lbs. I'll call her Lydia Their office manager was a 20s something lovely but incompetent young woman.  Lydia did all the actual work and kept the office running.  This was glaringly apparent to *everyone*.  When the office manager quit they advertised for another.  Lydia applied for the job and should have gotten it because she had been *doing* it all along.  No.  They all these fat, middle aged men hired *another* pretty young girl who had no idea of what she was doing while Lydia kept doing all the real work.  I asked her why she stayed and she told me ""I'm a fat, middle aged woman.  This is the only job I'm ever going to get.""  It showed me how different the world treated you if you were an unfuckable woman.  It enraged me because Lydia was basically doing *everyones* job for them.  "
"Unexpected public proposals. 

I've seen so many unfortunate videos from guys who propose in like a stadium and don't know the answer to their question before asking. "
Periods. They're not fantastic. They're not empowering. You fucking bleed and it fucking hurts. End of story.
"Assuming because a person is a woman, they must like to be gifted flowers/candy/jewelry, so they buy those things rather than paying attention to what that individual woman would actually like. Sure, some women do like those things. I do not, nor am I the only woman who does not."
"I was an intern assistant when I was an underage teen. The boss was looking for an assistant, I only had three weeks left. I saw the interviews he had with applicants. I read each application form and arranged the meetings myself. The best candidate was by far this gorgeous, single 30something woman. She was overqualified even. When she was waiting she told me she was new in town, got couple of interviews but not got hired and how if she can't find a job that month she had to leave. The next day the boss' wife comes to the office. I overheard them talk, she rejected him hiring that woman just because she was ""too hot"" he agreed and added she would be too much distraction for male employees and make the female employees uncomfortable too. She didn't get hired."
"My aunt is exceptionally beautiful and her coworkers don't make their jealousy of her a secret. She has a few stories but I'll just share one here. Once at work during her break a coworker overheard her say the word ""darling"" and ""I love you"" a few times on the phone. Later that day my uncle gets a call from that coworker saying that his wife is cheating on him and told him about the call. Ofc my aunt was on the phone with my uncle. It amazes me how much her coworker wanted to try to ruin her life regardless of how much of an asshat she would seem if her crazy assumption wasn't correct. "
"In my apartment building, I came in from running errands and was in bummy clothes with no makeup and got in the elevator. A man gets in with me and shoves into me even though we're the only people on the elevator, doesn't say sorry, and gives me some dirty looks. 

I was about to go out so I got myself ready, did my hair and makeup and put on nice clothes. Go down the elevator and the same man joins me again, but this time starts hitting on me and chatting me up not realizing I was the same person as before. 

Not quite an answer to this question, but I found this such an interesting test. "
"One of my college friends had her 21st birthday party at this rooftop club in Manhattan. She was really kind and sweet, but so, so beautiful, and she didn't realize that people treated her well because she was *beautiful* and not because of her great personality. Anyway, this club promoter promised her that she could get as many of her friends in as she wanted with free bottles for everyone, and when we showed up, he looked at all of us, singled me out and went, ""Not you. You're gonna have to either pay the cover or else I can't let you in."" When my friend asked why, he goes, ""Look, I didn't think you had ugly friends.""

So they all went in, I went home (because the night was pretty much ruined at that point and I wasn't going to pay upwards of a hundred bucks to get into a club that didn't want me there in the first place), and I have not been to a club or gone dancing in the four years since it happened."
Holy crap. I hope that person grew up to be a better person and is ashamed of their actions. No one deserves to be treated like that.
She can't have been *that* kind and sweet or she wouldn't have let a stranger treat her friend so poorly. 
"I will start by saying there are exceptions to every rule. If you play an instrument, that is sexy. But do not try to impress or woo a woman by performing a private concert in your living room. I had a guy bust out his guitar on our second date. He sang THREE whole songs while trying to gaze into my eyes, just waiting for me to fall in love with him. He wasn't even that good at guitar and a terrible singer. It was super awkward, but I'm glad it happened so I can look back and laugh."
"STEM careers. If you enjoy that work go for it but don't do it to ""fight the system"". "
"long-term, unrequited love despite multiple rejections. i've had to dump male friends for it even though i wasn't the object of affection, because it was too cringey. and they wouldn't listen to reason unless possibly if i was cruel (''you're a long haired neckbeard who smells. she's a pretty professional with an art career. stop. it. you're making her uncomfortable.'') but i never could bring myself to do it.

they actually operated under the belief that the longer their ''love'' held, the more romantic it would be to her when she came to her senses someday. because it was simply *impossible* that anybody loves her as much as they do.. and they don't realize how vaguely insulting that is to believe."
"I can get a class of 40 teenagers to shut up with one facial expression.

It took a lot of practice. But it's there.
"
"""I'm not like other girls""

mmkay"
"I know this sounds silly, but if they actively want you to fail at things. Board games, sports, new things you try. My ex would lust for my failures to point out I'm not good at everything I do. He couldn't stand not being the centre of attention for even a moment. At first I thought it was just fun sportsmanship, but it spread to other aspects of our life. Someone wanting you to fail at everything gets daunting. "
"The compliment, ""goddess"". Some women may like this, but I find it so over the top that's it's glib and insincere. I don't want to be put on a pedistal or be a goddess. Also, when the compliments start out so big, where else is there to go?

Again, just my take on it, I know there are women out there that probably really love being called goddesses. "
"This resonates, my mom had a friend when I was growing up who *bragged* about getting her husband to fire his assistant because she was ""too hot."" Further that she got final say over who the replacement was. I was maybe 15, and it was so disgusting I actually said something and got the ""when you're older you'll understand"" nonsense from her. I'm older. Glad to say I still don't understand."
was it wonderwall tho
My parents asked me 'What happened to the other 1%?' when I got 99% on some of my exams. Made me feel not good enough. 
"Poetry. 

Some women might dig it and some men I'm sure are good at it...but I'd say it's cringey upwards of 90% of the time. "
"I have a few, but once when I went to a concert in a well-known venue in a musical city that features a large floor area in front of a stage and a huge bar in the back.  I was feeling claustrophobic in the standing room only area and excused myself to the back to calm down while my friend stayed up front.  

Anyway, for the record, it is important to know that I am fat. After I calmed down, I went to the bar to get some ice water.  The bar was serviced by several bartenders, and patrons would line up in short lines and the bartender in your zone goes down the line horizontally.  It goes really fast, and I was in the third line, about third in line when I queued.  My turn came up, and the guy went right past me. This happened three or four more turns, like he didn't even see me there.  I waited it out, staring at him, and other patrons started to notice but didn't know what to do.  Finally, he went by me to the girl beside me, and she called him out on it.  He acted surprised, like he had just not seen me, which would have been impossible. I just said, ""I'd like water, and for the record, I was going to tip you anyway until you walked by me like I wasn't worth your time four or five times.  You really shouldn't treat your customers like that.""  I wanted to say more, but it took all I had to say that much.  I am forever grateful to that girl who stood up for me because she gave me the courage to stand up for myself.  "
"get mad at the ""other woman"" rather than their boyfriend. in most cases that girl deserves the blame too, but in *every* case your boyfriend cheated on you, she didn't."
"Sleeping around and not feeling things. People don't say this explicitly, but it's heavily implied. I'm all for stopping shaming women for sex and anti-slut campaigns, but vulnerable girls get confused and think that means it's not emotionally and physically risky to be cavalier about sex.(Coming from someone who bought into this shit for too long before realizing that giving men what they wanted from me and acting like it's was all good is not freaking empowering)"
"I can summon squirrels. 

I make a squeaking noise which is apparently the squirrel equivalent of a dog-whistle. Works best in parks, but I did it without thinking the other day and a squirrel came running up to me, out from under a parked car. "
Scarf down their food so fast that they vomit. Who are you trying to impress???
"My dad would make a lot of weird comments to my younger sister about what to wear/how to ""make the best"" of her body when we were teenagers. Lots of emphasis on revealing clothes and pectoral workouts. He and mom stopped buying us clothes when we started working (when I was twelve) but when my sister hit puberty, he was suddenly offering to buy us clothes again, but only if he could pick what we'd wear.

It made me super suspicious of adults and their motivations because my dad's fixation on this stuff felt wrong but in ways my mom wouldn't acknowledge and I couldn't articulate. I never let him buy me any clothes and to this day I go out of my way to dress in a way that he would see as unattractive.

Edit: holy shit I did not know how common these grossass dads are what the fuck"
"I learned that forgiveness is great and all, but my forgiveness doesn't mean that something doesn't bother me. In my next relationship, I want to be able to talk about the thing that hurt me or made me cry without feeling like it's a crime to bring up the past. I also want to be with someone who understands that I have a really hard time verbalizing things and most times a kiss and being held can fix shit when I'm angry because I mainly get angry when my feelings are hurt."
"Germs. Look, there's bacteria and viruses all over everything in your purse, using a paper towel to open the bathroom door or hold the bar on the subway isn't really doing much for your safety. There's probably more shit on your phone and your keyboard at work."
When they take an innocent pat as license to put their butthole in your face. 
"I like how you still respond in such a nice way, this kind of shit enrages me and i would've been abusive as fuck typing that comment."
"Waiting a few minutes to get your food at a restaurant, especially when you can see that it's busy. Somebody is cooking all your food and bringing it to you so you don't have to do a damn thing. It won't kill you to wait 20 minutes for a burger on a Saturday night, enjoy the leisure time, dammit!"
I can make hair products get discontinued just by discovering they're perfect for me. It's happened at least six times. Grrr.
"I don't know really what men think is romantic tbh, but something I've seen that makes me cringe is loud public displays of affection.

Like I was walking downtown once and this guy had a 4 piece band with him playing something while he proposed to his girlfriend.  I died of second hand embarrassment.

Also pretty much anything you see in a rom com."
It sounds stupid but I have dreams about where stuff I'm missing is sometimes and I later find it there.
"The whole ""any choice you make is empowering."" Nah, I simply don't believe that to be true, some choices are risky and harmful and not empowering"
Gossiping about how other women look 
"My best friend in highschool got a kid suspended because he was ""stalking"" her. He was an actually pretty nice guy. He just had bad skin and was mildly overweight. She thought he was hideous and, because he expressed interest in her, became 100% certain he was a stalker rapist, so she invented some story no one questioned and almost got him expelled.

Fast forward 3 years. Same friend is getting legitimately harassed by a co-worker and she just lets it fly because he's incredibly attractive. He shows up where she is because he follows her on social media (one of those people who ""checks in"" everywhere) and she thinks its romantic. Oh, he's also married. "
"This might come as a surprise, but when I was growing up, the zeitgeist for young girls was that to be a ""cool girl,"" you had to basically eschew all things girly because only dumb plastic bimbos liked girly things. Instead, you had to play sports and be able to hang with the guys. All it did was make me feel like a loser for being a girly girl and it took going to an all girls school to realize that other girls are awesome! "
"First rule of lawyering, never ask a question you don't already know the answer to"
"Treat life as some sort of tick-box exercise.

Some of the girls I know from school are in such a rush to 'grow up' that they settle down with their highschool bf at 19, pop out a few sprogs between 20 and 23, then proceed to spend the rest of their life moaning about how they have no social life/nothing in common with their husband.

In the meantime, they look down on anyone who stays single until they meet the right person, focuses on their career or dare I say it, just enjoys being alive for a while."
"Put down other women with stuff like, ""I'm not friends with women. They're just too much drama."""
"I don't know about worst case, but I am treated much better now than when I was fatter (less attractive). Some people can be fat and rock it, I am not one of them. People talk to me more often, hold open doors for me, and offer to help with some menial task more e.g. carry bags to car.

edit: I'm still not thin so maybe I am just this side of invisible."
"One of my closest friends is fat.  Men literally act like she doesn't exist. They'll acknowledge everyone else's presence and look right through her like she's invisible. If she does introduce herself,  they never remember her later.  It's incredibly common for men to remember me even after one meeting,  and not remember her even after multiple meetings,  even though we're almost always together.  Men will come up to me to try and strike up a conversation without even looking at her.  It's so rude.  She's used to it,  but it still upsets me.   


Edit:  for added fury I should point out that we have the same first name, so it's even more ridiculous that these guys have no problem remembering my name and not hers.  Women don't seem to have this memory problem.  "
"This story hits home for me. I was in a job for ten years that required up to 80% travel away from my family. I stayed in because I had proven myself to be valuable, and because I knew that attempting to find a job as an overweight, not pretty, and middle aged female would be difficult.  The job sucked the life out of me, and thankfully I was able to quit working all together a couple of years ago. 

Since quitting, I dropped 40 pounds and was recently told I was aging in reverse, so at least I have that going for me."
"Applying a one-size fits all mentality for romantic gestures. 

Some individuals would love grand romantic gestures but just because it worked in a romantic comedy or ""chick flick"" does not mean it's going to work in a real life setting. Some people really like receiving flowers/chocolate, other people don't. I think men tend to forget that women are individuals and their preferences may not match what media/their friends' girlfriends/etc preferences are."
"I work in pathology, and most people assume I spend my day cutting up dead bodies.

99.999999% of what we do is to diagnose/treat living patients.

When I cut up a body, it's strictly recreational."
"My biggest regret is that we broke up at all. He is a single father and didn't want more children. I would like at least one of my own someday, so I had to make the call. One of us was going to be miserable if went on any further. Problem is he was the love of my life. He is goofy, smart, loving, thoughtful, kind, my parents loved him, and I don't know that I'll find anyone like him. I've gone back into the dating pool, and it's just... depressing. Maybe I'm not giving them a chance but they come at me with dumb shit like ""send nudes"", and I remember when my ex first showed up at my door he had flowers in his hands. Without meaning to or knowing he had picked out my favorite flowers. Shit sucks yo"
"My meowing is realistic enough that cats tend to look around and go ""wait what the fuck was that"""
When they follow me into the bathroom then get on my lap while I'm trying to poop. Cmon cat.
"Diamond necklaces from mall jewelry stores. I love jewelry but the stuff they come up with every Valentine's Day are not only overpriced but ugly as sin. I swear ""chocolate"" diamonds exist to prey on unsuspecting men into thinking ""Well she likes chocolate and diamonds, she MUST like chocolate diamonds right? Right?"" "
Moana!
"""You mean, when I'm older I'll understand why it's okay mess with other people's lives because of my insecurities?"" "
"I get really, really gross. One dude at a bar didn't take no for an answer. I was drunk so when he said, ""I got a pocket full of condoms."" I blurted back, ""And I've got a pussy full of blood.""

He actually physically retched and walked away while I cackled."
"I was like 14 and had a hard time telling if other girls were making fun or me or being genuine. One day it hit me like ice water that the girls I sat with didn't like me at all and were being Mean Girl-y the whole time we were friends. I realized they were actually giving each other looks of 'lol, make her say something weird again.' 

I realized that I had a really bad level of awareness and I would draw negative attention to myself. It felt like I popped a bubble that separated me from everyone else. So for like 2 years in high school I cut everyone off and just watched how people interacted. I didn't get bullied anymore once I was quiet/kept to myself. I eventually learned how to fake it until I made it and didn't show any weirdness anymore. I did a lot of facial studying online and now I can read people pretty well.

In a way I think the bullying helped me. I feel like a shell of my former self but at least I don't get an immediate red flag of 'something is off with this person' anymore.

I still do the slow fade from friends, though, which I can't seem to fix. They seem to last for about 6 months."
"As someone who was very active in the Punk scene growing up, you would not have believed the amount of bullshit I saw from so called ""individualists"" and ""accepting"" people that treated anyone different from them like complete shit.

One girl who I was friends with was tall, slim, blonde, beautiful, no tattoos and every concert there was always at least two jackasses saying shit like ""I bet you can't even name two Bad Brains songs!""or ""If you're punk, then who is the drummer of Bad Religion?"" to her before or after gigs. Just complete fuckery from those in a subculture that was originally formed be the group where EVERYONE that related to them was welcome regardless of your tattoos or if you shopped at Hot Topic."

"There is a woman I know who is fabulous at her job. She is a spokesperson, on air personality, best salesperson on her team, etc. She also happens to be a fitness model. There were two separate occasions of jobs becoming available with some of the ad agencies I work with and my boss recommended this woman, and both times the (male) person said they would never even consider hiring her (in their male dominated business) because it would 'just be asking for trouble' because 'you know how men are'. 

If your male employees are incapable of behaving themselves around an attractive woman, then maybe your employees need to be replaced with men who have basic manners and respect. They are losing out on a fantastic, hard working, sales delivering person just because she happens to be very attractive.  

Oh, that same woman also told me that one guy who was running her station for a time said to her, in front of everyone, that 'it would really help the business' if she 'did some soft core porn'. .... :-/"
"Zen Minimalism. Get some nice looking rocks from the driveway, a bonsai or other cheap plant. Done. 

Another option could be : don't decorate on arrival. Just bring in some nice bedding, cushions and blankets, and leave space for your new home to be organically filled by all the things you'll love over the next few months."
"She generally was a sweet person, just incredibly naive. She's grown up since then and admitted it was a fucked-up situation, but I can't really blame her in the moment. The rest of her friends (hot sorority girls from upstate NY who had never met me before, mostly) were all psyched to go in, and I wouldn't have let her derail her entire party just because I had my feelings hurt, anyway. I mostly just wanted to go home alone after that, so it wasn't like we would've gone on to have a great night if they'd stuck with me out of principle."
Yes. And it's okay to choose medical interventions/pharmaceuticals to stop Menstruation.
"Agreed. Theres no reason to go inside after that, I'm pretty sure shes not that nice."
"Female tattoo artist here. You may know all this already, but here's what I'd do for what it's worth. I'd highly suggest getting a few laser sessions to lighten up what you have. You don't have to remove it completely. Just get it like 50% lighter. Then find a super skilled artist to give you a beautiful cover up. Be willing to do it slowly and patiently, and pay what it's worth. $100-200 an hour is normal depending on where you live, and waiting six months for an appointment is not unusual. I personally charge $120/hr and am booked four to six months out on average. The good news is that black actually goes away first with lasering, and that's the hardest to cover. 

Feel free to PM me with any questions. And for legitimacy sake, you can see my work on Instagram under the same username."
"Stare at my husband and me when we have sex. C'mon cats, don't make us part of your fetish."
I can usually tell you what time it is to within +/- 2 minutes without having looked at a clock recently.  I am also low-key supernaturally good at guessing exactly how big of a container is needed for a given amount of leftover food.
"Anything that doesn't need to be gendered painted in pink.  Seriously pink hammers, pink pepper spray, pink sports equipment...  Yes, it's fine to have a variety of colors.  I have an issue with it when it is marketed in a way that by painting it pink the company is now ""allowing"" girls to use the product.  "
"Doing pretty much anything by myself. I am happily married but if my husband is busy or doesn't want to go, I have no problem going to dinner or a movie or anything really by myself. "
"Ugh, thank you. I love stem and I'm studying for medical engineering, but I hate hearing that ""I'm such a good role model"" because of it. No, I'm a good role model because I'm doing what make me happy. College is not for everyone, and stem is not for everyone. If a young lady wants to do hair for a living, let her breathe and do what she wants to do. Just tell young ladies to do what they want to do and don't stop them."
"I'm not sure if this is better or worse but I once had a date seductively sit me down, then he stood back up and proceeded to do a twenty-five minute, only occasionally funny stand up routine. He was a firefighter with a slight lisp and it was all very confusing but I did end up sleeping with him so--"
"I can't agree with you more. When we first started dating, my current SO thought all women wanted was jewelry. I'm not one to even wear jewelry. It took me a while to get him to stop buying it for me. I'd rather have a book of tickets to Mike's car wash for my car. "
"Not drinking alcohol. I'm lucky that all my friends don't care if you're not drinking, but my family always makes a big deal out of it and acts like I'm *betraying* them by not drinking. I have another friend who was kind of pushed out of party last week because she didn't feel like drinking and she was told ""but we like you best when you're drunk"" and then ignored. "
"I really have to view it as a chronic condition that has to be managed, that comes with flare-ups, that I'll probably always be dealing with throughout my life. I tend to go through spells of really hard times, and then the next day I'm totally fine, so I try to remember that the darkest times are not permanent and that things will get better. 

Getting enough sleep is huge for me, as lack of it triggers anxiety attacks. Also exercise, keeping social and reaching out to friends irl or online, cooking and eating well, meditating and just breathing deeply. 

I get really frustrated with how much I feel like I've held myself back because of mental health issues, but I also just have to remember that these are the cards that I've been dealt, and that I am doing everything I can to get to a better place. "
My biggest regret is not breaking up much sooner - he was awful and abusive and made it really hard to get away.

"One time I had to hand in a paper in uni and got there about ten minutes too late. The people handling this are pretty strict about this and I was panicking because I spent a few weeks working on the paper.

There were already two girls arguing with the guy who was responsible for collecting the papers. He was like no, sorry, the deadline exists for a reason and we can't make exceptions for everyone and university is serious etc. One girl was already crying. 

When I got there, he suddenly became super friendly and told me that since WE were only a couple minutes late, he would make an exception and accept our papers. This was such an awkward situation.

I'm not *that* attractive though, I'm guessing I just seemed likeable to him."

"I'll never forget I was dropping off my boyfriend's lunch at his work a couple years ago. A conventionally attractive girl was exiting the building as I was entering and the security guard told her to ""have a good day."" She ignored him and as I passed him I said hello and he ignored me. Just a domino of rude behavior based on who's hot. Made me feel pretty shitty."
"I'm going to have a part of my arm blacked out. Maybe with some negative space and some designs depending on what my artist thinks. I also have a couple on my face I am getting lasered off. So I guess my answer is, be proactive about what you want changed."
You reminded me of a guy at summer camp ages ago who would carry around a guitar case to impress campers from the girl camp. No guitar mind you. Juuuust the case.
Don't spend money on food. It's okay to be hungry for two more hours if it lets you eat at home for much cheaper.
"I can find *anything.*  If there's something someone can't find, they come straight to me and I have it within two minutes.  My mom told me that when I was about six, my younger brother lost his doll in one of the massive piles of leaves in the yard.  I went down to the piles and plucked it right out.  I hadn't even been outside, but I somehow knew exactly where it was!

I really should take up treasure hunting, now that I think of it."
"Are you me? I had an ex who would blow up and turn things around on me whenever he hurt my feelings or did something selfish. I got used to just pretending nothing was wrong, then having a meltdown (usually drunk) and spending the next few days in abject fear that he'd dump me. 

The first time I got in a fight with my current bf, he asked me if he could sleep on it. I was sure he was going to break up with me the next day, but he came over with coffee and pastries and sat on my couch and talked out what happened and how we each reacted and how it made us feel and what to do better the next time we had a disagreement. I was blown away. 

I hope you find your person who knows how to treat you soon!"
"Being severely overweight.

Wow. That's rude as hell. You obviously don't deserve that.
"I learned that while ambition is great an all, I shouldn't drop everything to be with someone who consistently told me I wasn't the most important thing in their life and I never would be.

"I found it cringey when a few men indicated they already had a ring picked out/ proposal planned. Not because they wanted to be engaged to *me* but because they had those things waiting in the wings.

One guy said he already knew the ring he'd pick: a solitaire diamond from Tiffany, just what every woman wants! He told me how expensive it was too, like I was supposed to be wooed. We had only went on a few dates.

Another guy I was talking to for a few months told me how he planned to propose. He wanted to create a film with him proposing in the film and then invite his future girlfriend to see the film.

To me, it seems like these men were using proposals as a way to congratulate themselves for being so awesome without considering that their potential future  wife was an actual person who perhaps has their own preferences. I do not want a diamond ring, and I would be upset to receive one because it would mean the guy didn't value what I wanted. And I don't really care about movies, so being proposed to through a ""film"" wouldn't be meaningful.

"Absolutely. If you have a crush on someone you can't help it and you can't necessarily make the crush stop but you can remove yourself from the situation or just stop acting on it. Continuing to try to ""woo"" some girl for months when she's repeatedly told you no or is in another relationship is awkward and horrendous.  "
That's horrible on so many levels. Your friend kind of sucks

a lot of the time it feels like they're trying to use public pressure to get a yes... makes me feel really uncomfortable just watching it...
Thinking that everything and every part of you has to be beautiful. It's okay to not like aspects of yourself or to think of them as unpretty. Accepting yourself as imperfect is a lot more radical than labeling everything as beautiful.

"I lost a hundred pounds and I am treated profoundly differently socially, especially in the realm of politics and mental health. 

When I was fat, a panic attack would get me judged as attention-seeking and pathetic. Now, men rush to my side to help me if I show the slightest sign of discomfort. 

When I was fat, men acted (and said as much) that I was a feminist because I was a sad man-hater who can't catch dick. Those same types of men now treat me like my feminist beliefs are an extension of my ""Powerful Ballbusting Domme-y"" type personality.

"Whenever I was around peers things just felt off. It was like I was outside of their bubble looking in, trying to determine what system their social dynamics were following. Imagine you were observing ants in their terrarium. You can tell they have an order, a system, there are rules to their activity, but you cannot determine what exactly those are, and you cannot communicate with them.

There was one specific moment in kindergarden when we were all outside in our little backyard playing area and everyone was sitting around chatting, or playing with their toys in groups, or running around chasing each other, and I was standing by the fence turned towards them observing their behaviour and thinking to myself: I must figure out how this works.

I was a complete loner, I was later told that I communicated very poorly with my classmates, that I only answered with 'yes,' 'no,' and 'I don't know.' I don't remember this though. Often I said or did something brash, rude, or inappropriate that was a complete social gaffe but I didn't foresee it would be taken that way until it happened.

I was also told by a former elementary school classmate that she didn't like talking to me because it made her feel stupid. Apparently my interests at the time were not very common for our age. There were signs and moments before and after the one I described above, but this is the one that sticks out."

"Breaking up because of school. We planned on getting back together after he was done with school, and I planned on talking to him during summer break. I never saw him or spoke to him again, though,  because he died just before the semester ended.

12 years of friendship, 8 years of dating. It seemed like a good decision, and I missed him,  but we were doing pretty well. And then I got a call from one of our mutual friends. He told me to sit down,  and he gave me the news. 

It might have been the right decision at the time, but I regret not calling him, texting him, telling him the whole thing was stupid and that I missed him too much during those 9 months before he died."
"I remember when I told my dad I wanted to be a teacher or a writer in 9th grade, he told me I should be a doctor or a lawyer because ""It's really weird for a girl to be good at math and science like you are.""

Shortly after this my grades in both classes started tanking. I definitely didn't make a conscious decision to be bad in those classes or anything, but it was more that I let it slide when I did badly because I figured it was just normal for me to hate math.

In college I failed basic algebra twice. I got frustrated at that point remembering how I'd sailed through algebra in middle school, taken it a year earlier than most of my classmates and aced it, and how much I'd enjoyed my accelerated math classes leading up to that. 

I realized it was ridiculous for me to think ""I'm just bad at math"" so much when my childhood experiences were the opposite, prior to high school. I retook college algebra with the same professor a third time and passed with a B+. The following year I took graduate level statistics and got an A+. Now my job is 90% math and I love it."

"I was EXTREMELY nervous my first time -- to the point of getting light headed, shaky and a little nauseous. And it was all for nothing in the end! The entire thing took less than 15 minutes. You get about 10 cloth strips of hair pulled total, maybe even less. The bikini and ass strips are no worse than getting your eyebrows done. The strips do hurt more the closer they get to your clit, but the pain only lasts for about 2 seconds after the strip is off. My waxer would apply wax, tear, and then apply light pressure immediately after. 

The only spot that made me go, ""Fuck!"", was what my waxer calls the F-spot. It's the portion right above your clit and I've typically had two strips near that spot, one for each side. That part SUCKS. But it's the only section that makes me want to die -- again, only for two seconds after. 

The tweezing after the wax is done was more painful than the strips, in my opinion. And that's only because it's one at a time and I kept thinking we were done :-p The only other discomfort you might notice is your abs being a little sore the next day. My waxer said that sometimes happens from all the flexing in anticipation of ripping off the strips. (Though I didn't personally experience that.) 

All in all, don't psyche yourself out!! It's quick and the pain doesn't last. If you're super nervous, I know there are topical anesthetics you can get and perhaps apply beforehand, but I'd call your waxer first to make sure there are no adverse effects of that. 

Good luck!"
"Finding a hair in my food doesn't ruin my meal.  I'll pull it out and toss it aside, and continue eating.  It was probably mine anyway, my hair goes all the way down my back, and I think it's ridiculous when people throw fits over a single hair in their food.  "
"Building a wardrobe is freaking hard and expensive and for the most part I'm like totally clueless on what clothing looks good together and if things ""match"" and if stuff suits me well or even if it FITS properly. Most women have had their whole lives to learn this stuff and we have to rapidly pick it up over the course of a few years.

Also, some of us (most of us?) don't wanna be trans. It's maybe not ""appropriate"" to say this, and if other people are proud they're trans that's great, but speaking for myself I *hate* the fact that I'm trans and would give anything to be cis and not have to put up with hormones and surgery and dysphoria and dealing with emotionally disturbing childhood memories. We just want to disappear and forget we're trans, most of us. Being trans IS a worse than being cis. Having a trans body IS worse than having a cis body. To me anyway.

As a corollary to this and just a word of advice to cis women: *do not* tell trans women ""you're so lucky you don't get periods/can't get pregnant"". It reminds us of how our bodies are fundamentally different from cis people and that is something we can never fix, and most of us would *gladly* take the periods if it meant having a properly functioning female reproductive system. Most of us WANT to be able to carry our own children if we want children."
"Very rough and very public back rubs. If we're sitting at a cafe drinking coffee  and I say I slept wrong and can't look to my right, that isn't a cue for you to climb across the table and eviscerate my neck muscles.

"I moved to a new state when I was 15, after my parents divorced. I made new friends in my drama club right away, but no one talked to this really pretty girl, Kate, and when I said hi to her once, my new ""best friend"" reprimanded me-apparently Kate was a sl*t who slept with other girls boyfriends. I went along with not talking to her, since my friends weren't bullying her and she seemed fine with the small group of guys she hung out with. Until a few months later, when it was all over the paper that her stepfather had been arrested for sexually assaulting her and her sister. And everyone at school just started saying ""Sl*t"" as she walked by. My ""best friend"" even said it was Kate's fault for seducing her mom's husband! Now, this was the late 90's, so we already knew rape/molestation wasn't the girls fault-but the girls in my school were so jealous of this girl because she was so pretty, they made it her fault. I eased myself out of that social circle after that. I was working at the mall two years later and so was Kate. She came into the coffee shop where I worked and we chatted for a bit. She seemed to be ok, going to college, working, boyfriend, etc, and I guess she liked me because I was one of the only people who didn't torment her in high school, but simply not tormenting her wasn't enough. I wish I'd reached out to her. "
As the fat friend it makes me really happy that you feel that for your friend. You are a nice person. 
"When I was about 19 I wanted to try to work for a comic book store. I was/still am 5'2 and 98 ish pounds. I would say I'm about average on looks. I've loved comic books all my life. I have long boxes filled with them. I was denied the job despite having worked since I was about 12 (""volunteering"" but really getting paid in cash.) I wasn't really given a reason for it, but I wasn't bitter. Just a bit sad if anything. 

I still would get my books from them and could be called a regular. One of the workers ended up telling me that the owner would never hire women because they would be too distracting and that I especially wasn't considered because of how much people would ask about ""the little blonde."" Apparently one of the other regulars had Harley Quinn fantasies of me.

"Being able to fake their orgasms without their partners knowing. I know more than 1 women who have taken some weird sort of pride in being able to deceive men in that way. Which is weird to me because it's essentially bragging that your partners don't get you off and you don't communicate your needs to them.

I don't get how some people can be empowered by that but to each their own "
"This is mine too: ""It's empowering as long as it's her choice."" Oh shut up. I've made tons of non-empowering choices in my life, some of which I even thought were empowering at the time. It's not that simple and that's ok. Not every choice is or needs to be empowering. "

"This gets more pronounced the older I get (I'm in my mid-40s), but dudes who do routine maintenance *for themselves* and expect to be praised for it. Doing their own laundry, cleaning their own place, etc. Especially after insisting that we hang out at my place all the time, because his place is too gross.

It's hard work to balance a career and keep a house in good condition--I know, because I do it. Cleaning is a pain. But this is what we do to have nice things, right? I don't like mopping and vacuuming any more than anyone else, but I do like having a clean, pleasant home. Just like I really like my career and the things I accomplish there, but some of my work duties are boring and tedious. But obviously I do them anyway, because I like my job and it's in service to a larger goal. 

So, someone who is happy to enjoy the benefits of my hard work, without putting in that work themselves, *even for their own benefit* much less mine, does NOT get a medal for the few occasions where they bother to do something I've been doing every day.

I had basically the same response to another BF (both of us in our mid-30s at the time) who announced one day that this was the first month in years that he **didn't** go to his parents for money to pay his bills because he spent too much on bullshit. He honestly expected praise for that."

"I don't know why these guys would propose without ever discussing the idea of marriage or hinting at a potential proposal with their SO. Of course they don't deserve a humiliating public rejection, but tbh, they should know better."
"There was no one moment really as awareness of this wasn't a thing when I was growing up. It was fully undiagnosed in my case until I was 35, and only because of my son. 

I can say I knew I didn't understand complicated social stuff. Like in ballet someone bursting into tears was normal but I didn't ""get"" it. The whole group hug sympathetic reaction tears thing was a total mystery to me. I was great with teachers and coaches because I didn't require loads of attention, and harsh criticism didn't bother me most of the time. If it did, I'd say so very brazenly, and it got written off as ""sass"" or lady balls or whatever. Blunt speak got me in trouble a lot, but I wasn't bothered by it and probably should've been, or it would have been ""normal"" to be. I definitely understood grades and achievement though, and could tunnel vision on making improvements. 

What's funny is I did get diagnosed with a sensory processing disorder at around 18. I injured myself pretty seriously over a long period of time and should've known something was up. At the hospital I got an OT evaluation because of it and it turned out I don't register light touch correctly. Helped tons for physical activity because nothing ever hurt, but man sex was a fucked up thing. I literally had no idea why people cared about it for about 2 years. Which I never did with people from my school or friend group because watching the drama over it freaked me out. I was not a hugger or casual toucher because often I'd look at the touch rather than feel it and that is pretty weird to people. Turns out SPD is common in people on the spectrum.

Anyway son has it. When I took him for a neuropsych evaluation the evaluator asked about my diagnosis like ""duh."" Which got a ""lolwat?"" He was like ""I'm talking to you in a small space and your head is practically turned over your shoulder to avoid looking at me. Is this news to you?"" Got that done, HFA diagnosis. I don't medicate. My son has the very same one, and the very same light touch non registry. He goes to OT for that, and Speech to understand pragmatic language use. It's all social stuff, he articulates very well. He's absolutely not confused by the same things I was so far, but that's the difference medical advancements and early intervention makes."
"I know sometimes I lay awake in bed thinking about all the harsh shit I've said/done to people in the past. I was never a bully but I've done some insensitive things that I regret.

"I also used to be fat and less attractive. People are nicer to me about trivial things like holding the door open more and etc, but the flip side is that now other women are generally very mean to me and no one takes me seriously. I used to be praised for being 'so smart' and now if I accomplish anything it's 'clearly' because I screwed someone. So I have really mixed feelings."

"What if it doesn't hurt for me? I honestly don't mind my period and I don't think of it as a sign of inherent female inferiority or something like that. Why is it that men own one of the most fragile and sensitive organs in the human body and still somehow manage to culturally construct it into a sign of strength (""he's got balls""; ""balls of steel"", etc), while women can literally grow a whole human being from scratch in their bodies and feed it, yet there are zero positive associations with female reproductive organs, only negative ones?

"How very little I would have in common with what the media shows regarding transgender people. Its really off and kind of cringy. 

I very much dislike the amount of attention my ""tribe"" gets. Were such a small group and after an awkward transition stage its common we vanish. The loud drag queen looking types are often young and new to transitioning. Sometimes they are late in life transitioners and for that Im sorry, but their and my goals are much different.

A handful of people in my life know about my past and I like it that way. Im surprised how people who are ""supportive"" make me more uncomfortable than anything or anyone else. Its very obvious that they are treating me differently in an attempt to be supportive, but its the opposite of what I want. Im not your boss, do you, but its not helpful.

I hate how everyone fights over people like me when a lot of us just want to be left alone. I didnt expect early on how much Id dislike the level of media attention something that impacts me gets. Im surprised that Im most afraid when the media starts making drama about us for clicks.

I hate how everyone just lumps all trans people together into one group. There are definitely trans women out there who have autogynephilia, but if you say that you're being trans exclusionary. If *I* say that I get pinned for like, hating myself or something and projecting it. Both sides paint with too broad of a brush and a lot of the time it feels like no one really cares at all. They just want Karma or likes.

I am most surprised by how extremely normal my life is living as a woman. I dont have flags, I dont go to marches. I live practically the same life as any other woman.

"Men with kids. I know this sounds horrid but hear me out. I am 40, no kids. The last few guys who have shown interest and had kids were basically looking for a replacement mother. Dude, your kids have a mother. I know you hate her guts but I'm not going to step into her shoes. And also , if you bad mouth your ex you're gone, especially if I haven't raised the topic. 

One of the guys I mentioned above did that. The first and only phone call we had he started bad mouthing his ex almost immediately, didn't ask anything about me, and proceeded to tell me he couldn't wait to introduce me to his kids and how he was looking forward to having someone to cook and clean for him.

"It sounds like you made a hard but mature decision. You're right in saying that it would have come to a breaking point eventually, and I think it would have been much worse if you waited it out in hopes that he might change his mind. "
"That people generally show you who they are fairly quickly, most people are just too idealistic and hopeful to want ot see or believe it. 

Anger. If a guy yells in anger at all, I'm done. In fact, I don't really like loud men in general.

Judgemental. Nah, I ain't got time for any close mindedness and it generally tells me they have some self esteem issues that make them need to judge everyone else.

Unreliable. If I feel like you have been unreliable, I take that as a sign that is who you are and how much you respect your word to others. Nope. Do what you say and say what you mean. 

Entitlement. Unrealistic. Moody. Not a critical thinker. "
"The most OBVIOUS case I've experienced:

Friend's wedding. I am in the bridal party. Friend's new SIL is, too--obviously. We are all wearing the same dress and have the same makeup on. SIL is very pretty and not 'skinny' but definitely chubby pin-up proportions. I am heavier than she is but still consider myself fairly good-looking with decent proportions.

Time to eat, and it's a 'line up and get served' style feast. SIL (right in front of me in line) gets chatted up by all the male caterers, they are very obviously flirting with her. They spend several minutes talking to her and hold up the line.

I am served by the same people, give them a friendly smile and a ""hey how are ya?"" general courtesies. They don't even respond and look at me with almost bored expressions on their faces. My ""thank you!"" is met with no response either.

Like, OK guys I get that I'm not as good looking but you can't even manage a ""you're welcome""? After you were openly flirting and holding someone in line? Not gonna lie, it didn't feel good, especially since I had hair/makeup/pretty dress, the whole shebang--but aside from that everything was a great time."
Asking the real questions here. 
"Random groping. Then he feels sad and rejected when I'm not immediately into it, because he's attracted to ME, ALL the time, because I'm SO HOT. Like, goddamn do I love my boyfriend, but not wearing a bra isn't an invite for you to come up behind me and squeeze my tits while I'm cooking you dinner, it's 85 degrees in the apartment and I'm standing over the stove, I'm hot. Be romantic. Grab my waist. Hug me. Kiss my ear. Random ass groping is NOT gonna get you laid, honey. (My ex did it too. Ugh.)"
That creativity is a faucet you can just turn on and magically dispense art from.
"I love that wearing a nice pair of sneakers with pretty much anything is in style now and I""ll admit I abuse this trend generously. "
That I'm not pregnant. There's nothing pleasurable about it. 
I have a shimmer finishing spray for my hair I'll spritz on. It's super luxe and I love it. I'll also make sure my bra and panties match and are hella cute. 
"I like to positively gossip about women who dress well, but I think it's generally negative and unpleasant to talk about someone looking bad. "
"i get the feeling like most of those guys are either nice guys proposing to their friend, or guys doing it very, very inappropriately early in dating. the women look so shocked and sometimes angry (i take it to mean he's been rejected before)

so much criiinge"
Mine is spiders. I don't care about spiders. It's a small thing that is crawling very slowly. I don't understand why it warrants high-pitched screams. 
"""Well, you'll never be pretty, but at least you can be clean."""
I make sure my eyebrows are groomed and filled in. I find that makes a huge difference. 
"When people say ""men are animals"" as a justification for these kinds of things, I just think about my dog. I can place a big hunk of meat in front of his nose, and he won't eat it. Y'know why? Because I said ""no""."
*Insisting* on paying for a date.
"This! This! This! 

Ever since getting an iud, my life has gotten better. No periods, so no mega depression stemming from pms, my skin cleared up, and my migraines have almost went away completely. I always knew I had a terrible time with getting depressed a week or so before my period, but I couldn't have imagined the other benefits to not menstruating. But when I mention this to anyone around me I'm usually asked if ""I'm sure I want to risk my fertility like this"" or ""if I'll explode from all the blood building up inside me"" "
"Oh, no. He stopped carrying the case after someone asked him to play a song. The incident bemused me."
"I'm a Lydia, too. It's pretty much impossible for me to find work, even with multiple graduate degrees. "
"I feel they do. Don't propose in public if you don't know if she wants to marry you, that's embarrassing for her too"
"this so much, why is it supposedly empowering to not feel? why are girls still taught to that in order to enjoy privileges that men always have had (casual sex with no reputation damage), they have to be completely stoic about it? as though men are somehow stoic? it's a very warped version of equality you got going on there folks."
"It sounds demented when somebody has the clarity to spell it out that way but men and women and even friends do shit like this to each other all the time. I didn't notice how common and taken for granted these little snipes are until I realized I was doing it to my friends. 


Being able to genuinely wish the best for somebody when you gain nothing from it and may even look worse by comparison isn't a very easy thing for people to do. Hold on to the people who can do it and learn to do it for others. "
"Pregnancy sex was fantastic.  Afterwards things went back to pretty much normal.  Installing a latch on the door was vital. My husband and I have an art business, and we keep our stock in a shed.  After the kids were old enough to not need continual supervision (yay) we made a place for ourselves in the shed for afternoon delight.  His asking me if I wanted to do inventory with him makes me swoon.  "
I wear boxers with a fun pattern like sharks 🦈 
"When I broke up with my boyfriend before my current one he said 'Ill love you forever, Ill never stop loving you' 

me: 'yeah thats not true trust me' 

He went on to say something along the lines of 'no one will ever love you like I do' and 'you'll never have another good relationship'. 

The thing is, dating him was my biggest relationship fuckup"
"I actually don't mind when people take selfies.  I like seeing pictures of my friends, since I live far away from most of them.  But I do think it's cringey when the selfies are excessively seductive and carefully arranged in such a way that the person doesn't look like themselves at all."
"Touching your eyes. Soooo many people are squicked out by eyes, but...they're just eyes. When you put in contacts, you aren't jabbing them in there, you're being gentle and barely touching your eye. I wear medically necessary contact lenses and when people find this out, they're all ""You're so brave, I couldn't do that!"" If touching your eye to put in a lens was the only way you could see, you would do it too. And then you'd be over it."
"Nah, I didn't bother making a scene. It's pretty normal that strangers are much nicer to you when you're made up. I get more assistance in stores and people on the street are just generally nicer. It was just eye rolling and funny to experience it so obviously. "
"I don't know what men tend to think is romantic, but these are some things I've hated that I think THEY think makes them romantic:

- constantly touching/ caressing me especially in public

- prolonged eye contact ""dreamy"" staring at me

- doing every damn thing for me. I can manage to take the hook out of a fish's mouth that I caught, I don't need you to do my laundry and personal chores (obviously in a partnership I like having help with domestic chores, but I dated a guy who insisted on doing EVERYTHING)

- insisting on paying for everything and/or trying to take me shopping for clothes or something.  I can see how that type of thing might be romantic eventually but it was a new relationship and he wanted to buy me ""something nice"" to wear and it was just really fucking weird

Things that I think are romantic that I'm not sure if men know is romantic:

- boyfriend leaves the house before me and brushes the snow off my car for me

- random text through the day to ask how I am/is that girl at work still on my case etc relevant questions and check-ins

- speaks highly of me to his family and friends in a sincere way, but not constantly/overkill

- makes an effort to involve my family in things/can talk to my parents/ is outgoing with family

- if it's my turn to cook dinner or do dishes, he stands or sits in the kitchen and chats with me while I do the stuff

"
having casual sex and showing tons of skin. girls who don't want to have sex aren't oppressed and aren't prudes. girls who have a lot of sex aren't fighting the patriarchy simply because they are having sex and wearing skimpy clothes. being promiscuous is not empowering. this mindset is toxic af because girls are still being defined by how many people they've had sex with.. it's like 2 sides of the same shitty coin. just stop
"This is a big one for me. I'm monogamous and I've never slept with someone who I wasn't in a serious relationship with. More power to the women who are into hooking up and enjoy that but I place a lot of emotional importance on sex. I just don't think I could ever have sex with someone who I didn't have an emotional connection with. And I don't do that because men might call me a slut if I sleep with more men, it's about what I want and about what I want my sex life to be like! And THAT is empowering!  "
"I've heard before that it can be harder to diagnose woman because they are better at mimicking social situations, like in your post, while men struggle to imitate. I don't have a source so I might be talking crap though sorry. Your post just reminded me of it and I thought it was a little interesting. "
"Walk into the living room while I have company, make deep eye contact with my guest, and then shit on the floor deliberately and with unconcealed hatred burning in her little kitty cat eyes.  "
"Eh, it was her 21st birthday. It wasn't right, but I get it. What were they supposed to do, go to a different club where they'd be in line for two hours? Go to a dive bar, when they were already all dolled up for a club and would have looked completely out of place? And if I'm OP, my night is shot either way. There's no way to come back from that cruelty and have a good time that night.

Everyone on this sub is lying if they say they never did anything insanely selfish in their early 20s.  "
"I work at a small bar, just one bartender and one cook. Last week, I had some guy order something off the menu, which is no biggy, we often cater to whatever as long as we have it on hand. This night was exceptionally busy so I told the dude it's gonna be like 30-40 minutes, is that ok? He said he'd wait. 15 minutes later and he's in complete tantrum mode because ""WHY ISN'T MY FOOD OUT YET? I'M NOT EVEN HUNGRY ANYMORE."" "
"Alternatively, the compliment(?) ""unicorn"". As in, ""You're such a rare type of woman you're like a unicorn."" 

Had this said to me once. No. Just no."
"I'm a writer and a lot of people assume that I have substance abuse issues. I don't, but I've had so many people ask me ""what were you on when you wrote this?""."
"Sex work. Sure the middle class white college kid whose parents support her and she just wants extra money so she can go on overseas holidays might look like she's having a good time. But that is the exception. The overwhelming majority of women in 'sex work' are women who had no other choice than sell sex or end up homeless, have their child starve etc.

There's nothing empowering about making yourself sexually available to people that disgust you in order to be able to put food on your table. 

There nothing empowering about doing exactly what men want. 

And before someone tries to go off on me. I have the utmost respect for women who are doing what they need to do to survive. My issue is with the people (usually those who haven't even done sex work or if they have were the kind of exception I mentioned earlier) who act as if it's some revolutionary act against the patriarchy when in reality it's playing into the patriarchal idea that men can purchase women's bodies and consent.

Edit: spelling"

"If the script has people calling the woman ""plain"" or ""average,"" cast someone plain or average. 

Actually, having fat/average/ugly women in leading roles in general would be nice. I can point to plenty of tubby dudes in TV and film, but nowhere near as many ladies. 

"
"I'm not even asexual but yes this. Wasn't there that Cosmo article about that lady who abstained from sex for a year and wrote an article about it? I just.... didn't get the point. I'll bang when I'm in a relationship with someone I really care about. Until then, I have a great relationship with my hand and absolutely no tears are shed. 

Edit: This is by no way shitting on people who choose to have casual sex. It ain't my gig, but that's perfectly valid. I just don't understand the panic people have of ""you haven't been laid in three years??"" "

"that's a mild case! i knew a guy who was doing this for 6 years with no plans to stop. he eventually lost all his friends because he ruined every meeting by obsessing with her (mutual friend). 

met more than a few blokes who were still hung up on girls they hadn't seen since high school by the time they graduated uni. idgi. i think it's extreme emotional unavailability/wanting to be the tragic hero of their own romantic story."
"One dude wouldn't leave me alone and I straight up said ""I don't want to talk to you. Nobody here does. I do not owe you a conversation. Can you please leave"" and he did. Another guy wouldn't leave me alone in a VIP section of a club (that I paid for) and I asked him to leave. He tried to pour his drink over me and called me ""a fat cunt"" (I'm 120lbs lol) and told me to ""stop being so fucking cheeky"" (did I mention I paid for the booth he was gatecrashing?)

So yeah, the bouncers escorted him out"
"I hate this so much. I worked with a guy for 5-6 years who did this to me - in the span that we worked together I dated 4 guys (including my current bf). Every time I broke up with one of them, he'd ""swoop in"" and ask me out. I told him no so many times over the years and he never stopped trying to ""woo"" me.  

It was tough because we worked together, but we both quit within a few months of each other. He still kept texting me intermittently asking to hang out, which I always rejected/ignored. It finally stopped when I deleted him on fb (lol) because he told my bf's friend that we used to date and that he ""hoped (bf's name) was good enough for her."" I was SO creeped out and luckily haven't heard from him since. "
"If she never called them out or apologized for letting their buddy do that to her own friend, you did yourself a favor by avoiding her."
"I was at a Wal-Mart once and I bought an apple. As I was about to bite into it, the cashier stopped me and said, ""Please don't eat that until you've washed it. I saw the truck come in and there were stacks of raw chicken on top of all the fruits and vegetables. Some of them ripped open and there was raw chicken juices all over it."" I have never eaten anything raw again without washing it.     

Also, there are no toilets in fields and developing nations don't have ""pee breaks."" The US gets most produce from those nations. You're eating piss covered veggies.

"when i asked my ex why he wanted children, he specified that he wanted only girls, and he wanted to teach them all about his highly specific knowledge/hobby areas.

"Right out of college I went on my first job interview for an over the phone customer service representative. It was through a headhunter agency so I don't even know what the company sold.

I had been called ugly all the time until that point but that was the straw that broke the camel's back.  "

"What also bothers me about it is this relentless emphasis on beauty feels like a giant step back, like we're reduced to only being valued for our looks. I don't want hollow platitudes about beauty. It feels like the opposite of empowerment. Hollow platitudes come across as infantilizing. "

"Unfortunately that's perpetuated by pop-culture.  In his book *The Gift of Fear* Gavin deBecker talks about what a problem this can be.  He says:

&gt; This Hollywood formula could be called Boy Wants Girl, Girl Doesn’t Want Boy, Boy Harasses Girl, Boy Gets Girl. Many movies teach that if you just stay with it, even if you offend her, even if she says she wants nothing to do with you, even if you’ve treated her like trash (and sometimes because you’ve treated her like trash), you’ll get the girl.

and

&gt;It isn’t news that men and women often speak different languages, but when the stakes are the highest, it’s important to remember that men are nice when they pursue, and women are nice when they reject. Naturally this leads to confusion, and it brings us to the popular practice of letting him down easy. True to what they are taught, rejecting women often say less than they mean. True to what they are taught, men often hear less than what is said. Nowhere is this problem more alarmingly expressed than by the hundreds of thousands of fathers (and mothers), older brothers (and sisters), movies and television shows that teach most men that when she says no, that’s not what she means. Add to this all the women taught to “play hard to get,” when that’s not what they are really feeling. The result is that “no” can mean many things in this culture.

and probably most importantly

&gt; There’s a lesson in real-life stalking cases that young women can benefit from learning: persistence only proves persistence—it does not prove love. The fact that a romantic pursuer is relentless doesn’t mean you are special—it means he is troubled.

Not to say that every clingy guy is a stalker but it's something to be aware of.  It's a fascinating book I think everyone should read."
"Try too hard to be ""one of the guys."" I'm not referring to those who are like this naturally but women who do it to impress them. I worked with a teacher who traded her car for a lifted truck to match her boyfriend. She could barely get inside and driving that thing stressed her out."
The only exception here is if you don't care what the answer is 
Right? Can we stop with all the girl hate? 
"I can make a whole tray of cheese and crackers disappear.

I can sense when there is leftover pizza/sandwiches in the meeting room from after lunch meetings.

I can detect who has the root beer barrels in their candy bowl.

I can tell the gender of the baby that a woman is going to have before she knows.  I've gotten this right in 17 cases straight over the past 11 years.  Women in the various companies I have worked at have come to me in the early stages of their pregnancies and asked.  I've literally never been wrong.  Conversely, I've never named said child correctly.  I am 0 for 17 in that area.

"Not washing fruits and veg before eating. Like, I know the reasons why I should, but I just don't do it. 

Edit: Confirmed! A post about something that freaks people out is making the pro-washing people freak out. "
"Honestly, sports and ""cool girl"" things in general. It shouldn't be empowering for a girl to do those things - she should just do them if she likes them/is good at them, but she doesn't need to be put on a pedestal for it. 

And if you like being a girly-girl, rock that shit! Self-confidence is empowering - it doesn't matter what you do with it. "

"Im probably more riled up than necessary to be honest, this just grinds my gears on some fundamental level. I mean I'm sure you're right about being pragmatic about the situation. But god-damnit the whole situation is so freaking.... it pisses me off. I mean its human nature and its just business, but man it makes me mad.            "
"Yep, I almost ended up in grad school for physics because of this junk. I worked my butt off in undergrad trying to prove I was tough and smart because I believed being in that field was the proof I needed to be ""successful"" as a woman. And it didn't bring me a sense of satisfaction. Thank goodness I ended working at a research lab for a hospital and realized where I really wanted to be was making a real difference in the world through practical means (physical therapy) rather than producing articles that would be read by a niche few. So it's not a male-dominated field, so what? It's still important work.

Problem solving and research remain intensely satisfying for me and I'm so glad I can incorporate them into my life without dedicating my career to STEM. That said, getting a degree in physics and working in STEM for a bit did give me an ""I can do anything"" attitude which I super appreciate now, I'm just glad it stopped being the only field I could feel okay about seeing myself in."
"Right, but like... I still didn't want to go in. I would've been self-conscious and upset the whole night anyway. Sure, it would've been nice if she'd offered, but that's done is done and it wouldn't have made up for the guy insulting me in the first place."

"I notice when I started college and began working. I am below average. I know this because how people treat me. No one goes out of their way to help me at work, but if this other girl has a little ""issues"" they all flock over to help. A lot of guys at my work won't even give me the time of day. I don't think anyone as called me out on my looks. I don't think I am ugly, I am more of an ""ehh"".  Oh wells, I just need to work on myself more. I started a diet (Well a life change)  a month ago and I lost about ten pounds now. Just 30 more to go! "
"We'd only been together about a month, its the beginning of college, we're not official/we're just exclusively fucking. He did absolutely nothing for my birthday. We had class all day, he promised me a backrub after class, then fell asleep. I was fine with it as we'd only been together a month and weren't official; I wasn't expecting anything.

Then the next day was our best friend's (we were/are a little trio) roommate's birthday. And he had known her the same length of time. And we also had class all day her birthday. And he wasn't sleeping with her. And he rushed out of class and baked a cake and him and my best friend ran around gathering people to sing happy birthday to her + eat cake and ice cream.

I turned in early and cried a LOT. I felt so extremely used and like he didn't care for me at all."

"• When it comes to fashion, figure out your main 3-4 colors. Ask a few close friends or family what color they like you in the best. Consider their input along with your own personal opinion. Then stick to buying some solid pieces first. Get a good pair of jeans and/or skirt. Stick to basics first. 

• Learn your body type and how to dress your shape. Don't think about height and weight, but *shape.* I promise, promise, this is a game changer. For instance, I'm long and lean and want to create curves. I do this by accentuating my waist with a belt or wear sweetheart necks or scoop shirts. I can also do this with street wear when I want to wear high tops. I add a small feminine touch with jewelry or curls in my hair. 

•Pinterest is also my lifesaver (don't laugh). Let's say you have a red shirt or solid white tee and don't know how to make it trendy or stylish. Just type in ""red shirt outfit"" and Pinterest will show you examples. You can put in any piece and it will help you (I.e. white shoes outfit). That way you don't have to buy a whole lot because they'll show examples of different ways to wear stuff.

• That [baby oil gel ](https://www.johnsonsbaby.com/oil/johnsons-baby-oil-gel) (not the regular oil) is the best stuff to shave with on the planet. If you need a quick tan or want to make your arms flawless, body makeup like [Sally Hansen Leg Makeup](http://www.ulta.com/salon-airbrush-legs-leg-makeup?productId=xlsImpprod2870017) is the jam. Just make sure to mix it with light moisturizer beforehand. I use it to fake people out all the time by making my abs look good, legs long and lean. You can accomplish lengthening your legs by wearing nude heels. Then take a shimmer or baby oil gel and hit your shin bones and forearm bone. It'll create just enough pop and glimmer to accentuate your body. 

• Don't worry about expensive jewelry. Just get you a good pair of [fake CC](http://www.claires.com/us/cz-crown-setting-stud-earrings-132186.html?cgid=30#cgid=30&amp;start=9) diamond earrings and rock them like they're real. Don't be afraid to branch out and go bold with bright fingernails and matching toe nail polish. It's the little subtleties that go a long way. 

I bet you're doing amazing and look beautiful!

"It's actually pretty great, because I can be anywhere from invisible to attractive just by changing the amount of effort I put into my appeareance. It's easy for people to take me seriously and find me funny or smart in an academic/social/workplace context, but it's also relatively easy to get male attention when it is appropiate. I know when someone is attracted to me it's not just my looks, and at the same time I can safely assume they are reasonably attracted to me physically as well.

"People who judged me then are judgmental now. Some people love to diminish my accomplishments. ""You look great! I wish I had your genetics and could lose weight too!"" *No, you did* ***not*** *just say what I think you said.* To be completely blunt, I stopped making excuses by my overeating and ate less every day for a long, long time. I still do. It's not my genetics, it's hard work. I'm not different, I'm just a binge overeater that doesn't partake in it.

In my case no one took me seriously before and now I get more respect. Maybe I'm in a ""nexus"" point and it will go downhill later.

The screwing people thing, I mean that happened before. It's that who I get paired off with is different. Coworkers assumed I was dated my equally-fat best guy friend. Now instead of pairing with him I'm 'clearly' the girlfriend of a different, thinner friend."

I hate euthanizing and try every avenue before it that I can. 

But I can only do so much with the $20 the shelter gets in donations each week. We rely on donations and adoption fees to keep our doors open and food and medicine for the animals. "

"He started lying about why he couldn't spend time with me in the evenings. Saying he was studying or he had to talk to his parents or something.

Dude, we both lived in the same study dorm. He lived in a room above mine, we shared a kitchen. All I had to do was walk past his room and I could hear him playing videogames.

I made him admit it and he confessed he had just started playing a new game called League of Legends with his friends and it was very addictive. He said he felt bad for wanting to play the game rather than spend time with me but that it was a tough choice some nights. He agreed to be honest and also split his time more evenly.

So anyway on nights we didn't spend together, I ended up secretly playing LoL as well and practising it a lot. After a few weeks I felt confident enough and I asked him if I could play with him. I pretended to have just gone through the tutorial. He hesitated and he didn't want me to play with his friends yet so we played a game together first.

**I carried the team to victory.**

And thus began my three year long League of Legends addiction...

Oh I mean thus began our now six year long relationship with my SO."

"Former fatty here, I think men has this fear that if they treat fat women with the basic courtesy that they treat their peers of both genders, it might be mistaken for romantic interest or something because they have this idea of fat people as sad losers starved for attention with standards so low that we're just waiting to fall in love with the first person with a penis to show us attention and we can't have that, right. (I like to compare it with unattractive straight men who thinks every gay man is trying to fuck them)

**edit:** I wrote the following as a response to a comment below, but since I spent a really long time on it (I need a life or a blog or something I know, but it's summer break and I took too much Adderall this morning so I don't want it to get buried after all that effort :( and it kinda elaborates on my original comment although it has more focus on dating/FWB sex (I guess the original paragraph can be considered a TLDR on top of the TLDR that I made from the new post - sorry guys! Maybe this is why I'm single and it has nothing to do with my weight and more to do with my hyperactivity - whops) Also, some minor edits will be done for grammar and readability as I'm tweaking on (legally prescribed) amphetamines (it's ok I just went off them for a while because summer break and am starting to build up again for fall semester and well.. this is why we start early). Anyway I understand it's really narcissistic editing a less visible comment into a more visible comment, but since the intention behind both is the same and the following is the long-form elaboration to what I wrote above I don't feel like I've misled the people that upvoted the original comment so far. I really hope I haven't violated reddit/sub etiquette/rules, but of course if I have I will accept whatever penalty that comes with that. 

TLDR; People who fuck you without being attracted to you are self-hating and it's not healthy for either party involved. In general, people are insecure and need other people to make themselves look better and are worried that being seen with unattractive people will make them appear uglier. People should stop using other people's physical appearance for validation of theirs - that's what we have German cars, watches and designer purses for.

What's really funny is that I grew up fat (and honestly, straight up ugly. Genetics were not kind to me and I needed non-elective facial surgery in my late teens which as a side-effect fixed a really fucked up facial feature, and being cursed with acne starting at 9 actually turned into a blessing since it forced me to always be on top of skincare. And if I can just plug a whole food plant based diet for a tiny second it's great for the animals, the environment, your skin, AND weight loss - it's so much winning, but it's the kind you won't get tired of because you'll have so much energy!), so I never really realized how shitty people treated me for being ugly because it was all I knew until I lost weight in my late teens. A couple of years back I regained about 30 lbs - a little less than half what I initially lost and maintained for many years - for a while after going through a stressful period. Guys would suddenly be so rude and dismissive to me in social situations and it was really funny considering these were guys I would never have dated at any weight, but I would still have been nice to them if they had been friends of friends or if I had met them in a work or school setting -- you know non-romantic situations where it's normal to be inclusive and friendly. And the thing was, my standards never changed. I'd rather have no sex than to lower my standards from the guys that I dated and hooked up with when I was 30 lbs lighter. I have one standard that goes for dating and fucking, and that goes for when I weigh 130 lbs, 200 lbs and anything in between, even if that means no sex at 200 lbs.

Then of course there is the category of guys* that is more than happy to fuck, cuddle and maybe even do the relationship experience with you in private, but will always make it very clear that he's not interested in a relationship even when you don't bring it up. Like, you'll come over for sexy time and start making out with them then out of nowhere he'll drop the -""I'M NOT LOOKING FOR A RELATIONSHIP BUT LET'S HAVE SEX NOW AND THEN YOU LEAVE TOMORROW AT 6AM EVEN THOUGH TOMORROW IS SATURDAY OK?"".

Like, plenty of guys legitimately don't have time for a relationship or there isn't any other chemistry than sexual, and that's fine - I like no-strings attached sex too, but every time I had a fuck buddy when I was fat the guys would just always be so condescending and so proactive about making it clear that **they do not want a relationship**, while when I'm smaller the issue seems to be raised and discussed more organically from both sides. Of course I'm not saying immature assholes are a fat girls only problem, because it's really not, but in my experience you can really tell when they resent themselves for fucking you and treat you accordingly.

I quit fucking while fat because I had two options. 1) I could lower my standards which I wouldn't do - and this wouldn't necessarily have solved anything, because less attractive people can still be superficial and keep fucking you on the down-low while hoping for someone more attractive to come along, or 2) I could go along with fucking someone who didn't want to fuck me, but still did because for some reason he couldn't fuck the person he wanted to, and he'd resent me for that, and he'd keep resenting me for it, and when whoever he wanted to fuck would become available, he'd dump me with no regards for my feelings. I could pretend not to catch feelings (maybe I wouldn't, but maybe I would - I'm too old to pretend to be the cool girl who never catch feelings for the people I fuck.), but a lot of times it really hurt, which combined with the body issues I had at the time set my own progress to get back to my happy place mentally and physically back, and ain't nobody got time for that. I couldn't let myself get treated that way, and I realized I didn't want to enable the guy to treat himself that way either, because it takes a lot of self-loathing to make yourself fuck someone you're physically repulsed by, so I realized my life was just a lot less complicated if I removed the sex variable from it while I got my life back on track. Almost a year without sex got pretty miserable at times, but I don't think the alternative would've been better or made me happier - on the contrary - it could've made things more complicated and me more miserable. 

It sounds like a cliche, but at the end of the day I think it all comes down to confidence - I stayed friends with some of the guys I dated when I was conventionally attractive, and a couple of them were the kind of guys that were typical ""Chads""** or whatever they're called these days - some were former and current college athletes, tall - a few were signed to modeling agencies - all were graduates of prestigious schools, have really great jobs, lots of friends, and overall have great things going on in their lives, and when I was at my lowest mentally because I had gained weight and was pretty much trying to hide from the world (which again is ironic because it wasn't even half the weight I had originally lost), one of them was the one that dragged me out, he didn't give a shit about being seen with the arm around and hugging the fat girl because fuck it every guy probably still wanted to be him (alternatively people probably thought I was his special needs sister or something haha).

*I'm not trying to be intentionally heteronormative or exclusionary, but my experience is with guys hence the pronouns. I know there are plenty of shitty girls out there too :(

** Before this post get linked to from that sub that begins with an *i* and ends with a *ncels* as an example of fat girl who only dates 10s so what hope is there for the rest of you; no my base standard for dating and fucking is not tall ivy-league educated athletes who does modeling gigs on the side and has amazing personalities (although the great personality thing is non-negotiable, but thankfully it's also the easiest to achieve and doesn't require any money or great genetics:), those were extreme outliers for me - read the first paragraph; I was a fat kid who needed non-elective surgery to look normal where the looking normal part was just a fucking positive side-effect, I could easily have been the female version of one of you, and for a while in my teens I was definitely a legbeard. I fucking know what being in a dark place mentally and physically is like, where you feel like ending it is the only outcome because you're trapped in a body and situation that you'll never escape from, so don't fucking think I don't know what it's like. Don't let it consume you. Take a shower, shave, get a haircut, buy new clothes, CICO if you're overweight. It probably won't change anything anytime soon honestly, but baby steps. Do what you can now. A lot of therapists have sliding scale-based fees. Baby-fucking-steps. 2 years, 5 years from now it will definitely make a huge fucking difference even if you might still be a virgin 6 months from now."
"Coming to my bedroom window instead of the goddamned front door. I woke up to a guy I went on a couple dates with on my back porch, leaving me something because I didn't open the front door.

"Jealousy is poison. It's insidious. The more you think you're holding on to someone, the more you're pushing them away. This is a lesson I learned the hard way with one of my first girlfriends and I'm glad I learned it."
"I agree. But there's a catch 22 here, in that it's really hard to care for yourself if you don't love yourself. And everything in our society teaches us that being  fat is hideous, shameful, disgusting. 

I have a very close friend who was severely overweight most of her life. About five years ago she lost over 150 pounds. I myself have about 40 extra pounds, and often find myself referring to her methods, which I find extremely empowering, especially when in a pit of despair, despising myself and my body. 

1) She reframed the word ""fat"" to remove the negative connotations. Our culture has turned ""fat"" into such an emotionally-loaded four letter word. It's used as an insult and considered an awful thing to call someone. But really, why should I'm fat be any different from I'm blonde, or I'm 5'8? Fat is my current physical state, it's a simple fact, and I'm not going to beat myself up about it. Instead I'm going to accept it, and focus on ways I can change it, just like I can change my hair color. 

2) She refused to buy in to cultural stereotypes of beauty. She would look in the mirror every day and tell herself how loved and beautiful she was. She wore cute outfits and wasn't afraid of the camera. 

There's some other stuff too but I've run out of time. In a nutshell, it doesn't do any good for fat people to hide themselves and despise themselves and fall into deep depressions. And there is something that is incredibly empowering about refusing to allow others to define you. Im glad there are more fat women out there taking this stance so publicly. I wish them well on their journey, regardless of whether that path includes losing weight or not. "

"Sometimes it's not about fighting a system or something.

I took a genders studies class when I first began college. And one week we studied the gender disparity in male dominated fields like STEM fields. And I'm sitting in this group of women, and we talked about it and at some point it almost felt like we were complaining about how woman don't go into science and math. And then I asked everyone what they were going into. All of us were planning on going into psychology, sociology, or communications. I felt a little weird about it, especially considering I was always very good at math and the like. 

Next semester I took a computer science course and loved it. I'll be graduating with my degree this year, and I honestly feel like I owe it to that moment. 

Sometimes it's more about getting the idea out and not about judging anyone for what they want to do. Nothing is for everyone, but I had never even considered I could do STEM until that day. 

I don't know, nothing is black and white.  "
"I was diagnosed by one psychologist when I was 12 and blissfully unaware of Asperger's. I remember I would talk about random shit (like my cat knocking water off the bed last week) instead of answer her questions. Then I did research on what they did that made them stand out (no eye contact, bringing up old conversation topics/not letting the conversation flow smoothly, etc.) and managed to fool the next one I got around the same time I changed my behavior in school. 

When I walked in to meet her she went ""Just looking at you, I don't think you have Asperger's since you are able to hold eye contact with me."" (This is something that I still hate to this day but force myself to do it. You know that old Spongebob episode where he puts his eyeballs all over the map? I feel like I am the map sometimes.)

The downside is that my mom believed the second psychologist and doesn't believe I have any problems. I still very much struggle with friends/relationships. Again, the only thing I learned so far is just how to 'appear' normal to people (basically don't throw red flags.)"

"My aunt told me this story during a heart-to-heart when I was in high school because I told her I felt ugly. Her point was not to strive to be beautiful and that beauty comes with a lot of complications- i.e. jealousy and isolation from girls and too much unwanted attention from guys (she also told me that during a date with one of her brother's friends she was almost raped). I didn't actually ask how her coworker knew my uncle's number. There was a lot of other information to take in. I had the impression that the employee called the home phone, but I could be wrong."
"Exactly. I had a big mouth as a kid so it could've gone there, challenging authority figures was good fun. My mom was giving me the death glare though so I just walked away. She later explained that her friend had met her husband while he was married to his ex as if that made it okay. Awareness that desperation and idiocy can lead to marriage was real that day. "
"A guy my Mum knew *very* obviously carried a torch for her all the way from university, through her marriage, 3 kids, bereavement, everything.

I'm pretty sure she respected him less for it because beyond a certain point, it became very clear that it wasn't about her, it was about him wanting an idealised love and her being around at that particular moment in his life. "

I go to order and its the GM taking our orders, he's some weird middle aged guy. I order a HBCB, fries, and a drink, so he said something like ""Oh you should order more! You need a cheeseburger or something, you're too skinny!"" with a smile like he was trying to hit on me but obviously didn't realize that he was being rude. So me being stoned out of my mind, I just say ""No I just want my biscuit and my fries and my drink"". Then my friend goes to order, and she orders a cheeseburger, fries, and a drink and this guy said something like ""Wow you have quite an appetite tonight!"" 

I wasn't going to bring it up, but she asked us later if we noticed how differently he treated us. If I wasn't stoned I would have called him out on it, but I didn't want to cause a scene and get us into trouble. It sticks out in my mind though because I'm not usually the girl that gets special treatment, I'm usually the ""ugly"" one."

"Story time! 

When I was dating my now ex bf, I quickly learned that his ex gf was still friends with their group of friends. After seeing each other a few times, she came up to me, shook my hand and introduced herself. At that moment I acknowledged I could be a huge cliche or drop my guard and see where this goes, after all it took a lot of balls to come introduce herself and I respected the hell out of that. 
Turns out she was fucking awesome! She &amp; I were basically the same person and quickly became close friends. He and I broke up after 4 years of dating. She and I are still best friends today. I'm an ""aunt"" to her boys, I've driven across country with her singing at the top of our lungs just to stay awake at night, she's my other half, my soul sister - idc how cheesy this sounds, it's true! My life would be totally different without this girl in my life.

Moral of the story: It's easy to want to hate your man's ex, but swallow your pride and get to know her, you might be surprised how well you two get along. "

So he fell in love with his highest version of her and could never get past that. It doesn't excuse how he treated Harry, but if you think about it the reason he hated Harry was not just because he looked like James. He was a constant reminder to snape of what he could never have and a reminder of lily. It's just like reality in that people who are hurting lash out. It doesn't make what he did right, but I look at it from a more empathetic or sympathetic view and that makes me love the character and the way he was written. "
"So this was another top comment and now I'm wondering- does it depend on the talent, or the girl, or the situation? Becausey husband sang to me on our first day (well, the third day of our first date, but that's another story) and it was amazing. BUT he's a wonderful singer, and it started out him and his roommate playing/singing fun songs that you could tell they would genuinely do whether or not there was a girl there. Like, such hits as *Margaritaville* and *My Vagina Belongs to Jesus*. He did sing cheesy songs to just me later that night but I was already hooked. But again, hot guy + great voice + talented musician + sappy chick might just be the magical combination lol"

My biggest regret is thinking that no matter how much I changed for him (it was literally things he asked me to change for him) I knew in the back of my head that it would never be enough. I knew that in the end he would never fully love me. And that his love was full of conditions. That hurt me the most. The pain I put myself through. I should've let it go months before I did. I wish so badly I didn't go through that because now I have such a hard time believing I'm worthy of love just the way I am. :/

"- **Creepy romantic gestures.** In romantic comedies, something like showing up at someone's door every day for a month with flowers to convince them to love you, after they rejected you, is seen as acceptable. In real life, it's not at all okay, it's disturbing to not take no for an answer.

- **Mental illness and its treatment.** It seems to be another pretty common idea in books and on screen that if you are sick, someone will find you beautiful and fall in love with you and save you. It doesn't always work out so conveniently in reality.

- **Losing your virginity.** There are all sorts of sexist and heteronormative ideas surrounding it anyway and it doesn't have to be a huge deal. If it is for you, so be it, but it's not going to be a spectacular, massively life-altering moment for many people and that's okay.

"Fairy lights, nice but cheap fabrics to drape over stuff can brighten a place up. I'm a fan of little fake plants as well because a real plant would die a horrendous death in my care. Also, candles."
"Anytime someone says ""No one will ever love you like I do"" they are manipulating your natural fear of the unknown future so you stay with them. 

👍 I'm glad you got out of that"
"By no means is this the worst, just most frequent. My SO and I go to a couple of cons a year with another couple. Even in cosplay someone will come over just to take the pictures of everyone with me and I just hold everyone's things. "
"I notice doctors at work talk differently to the prettier, thinner, younger nurses. A lot friendlier than towards me. Some doctors act like i'm annoying them. "
"I mean, if you don't want to have the conversations, you could always just say that you used to swim and just move past it. Or just say it has multiple personal meanings. No one is entitled to your personal stories if you feel weird sharing them, after all."
Sounds like my brother. He would go to the bar/restaurant with blueprints and act like a big wig contractor trying to get work done while sipping on a beer.
"Being an outsider (romantics would probably call it unique, special, or whatever else like that).

Being on the outside sucks. A lot. It's depressing and lonely. It results in being bullied or misunderstood or ignored or actively avoided. It's much better, less stressful to be socially acceptable."
"Hits close to home. I don't let it phase me as much anymore. I'm happy you stood up for yourself, it takes courage!"
"setting me up with men does not work the same way setting you up does. I know you're trying to be nice and I do appreciate it(!!!), but 90% of them have women my size on their ""Do not fuck"" list and you're making it awkward for both of us. unless you know he's into me don't worry about my dating life, I'll be okay! "

"I used to get 'if you can't be decorative, at least be functional' from my Mum. "
"The only advice I can give is you just have to decide to do it.  
**Decide** that nothing will stop you.   

My own motivation was vanity, I lost a little over 90 lbs. I was tired of wasting money on make-up to try and make my face less fat.   
My face *was* fat and I got tired of it."
"Friend of mine and his wife would do the ""fake proposal"" thing when they were traveling. He'd get down on one knee in the restaurant and propose and everyone would ooh and aww and clap. She'd tearfully say yes, they'd embrace, and he'd go back to his seat all fumbly while she looked at her ""new"" ring.

Always got free food. Helped that she kept her name. His name looked like someone rage-quitted at Scrabble. "
"EVERYTHING IS LOOSE AND BILLOWLY AND BOXY AND IN UGLY EARTHY TONES AND PASTELS.

WHYYYYYYYYYYY

Even if I liked these things, I still could not wear them. Big boobs, olive/green undertones. "
I'm sorry that happened to you. How do people do things like this and not feel like complete pieces of shit?
"I love this quote from *Gone Girl* about that. 

&gt;He loved a girl who doesn't exist. A girl I was pretending to be. The Cool Girl. Men always use that as the defining compliment, right? She’s a cool girl. Being Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker and dirty jokes, who plays videogames and chugs beer loves threesomes and anal sex and jams chilidogs into my mouth like I’m hosting the world's biggest culinary gang-bang- while remaining a size 2, because cool girls are above all hot. Hot and understanding. Cool girls never get angry at their men, they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner. Go ahead! Shit on me, I don't mind, I'm the cool girl. 

&gt;I waited patiently -years- for the pendulum to swing the other way, for men to start reading Jane Austen, organize scrapbook parties and make out with each other while we leer. And then we'd say, yeah, he's a cool guy. 

&gt;Instead, women across the nation colluded in our degradation! Pretty soon every girl was Cool Girl, and if you weren't, then there was something wrong with you.

"Jealousy. If you don't trust your partner around other people, you shouldn't be with them. It shouldn't matter if anyone else likes your partner. They're YOUR partner. Be happy about that."
"The guy was a jerk, but so was your friend.

I'm a bit angry that she didn't get out of the car and actually just drove off with him. She should not have allowed him to get away with saying such a thing..."
"Haven't had the big dick thing happen, but I have had a guy tell me ""women won't stop obsessing over me after we have sex, so now I have to hold myself back."" This was on our first date, our first time meeting. "
"Followed shortly by ""I'm not a girly girl. I'm a rough in tumble girl who likes jeans and a t-shirt.""

Yup. I like jeans and a t-shirt and I like wearing dresses, what does that make me? I've learned to start ignoring other women my age who start off with ""I'm not like other girls."" "
"Seriously. It sucks. If you're an unattractive woman, people make sure you know it because so much of women's value in our society is based on looks."
"1)

 If after a while of dating he doesn't try to blend your lives together (ex. Be each other's plus ones to events, be together on holidays, hang out with each other's friends) My ex always made me feel weird and clingy because I wanted him to do normal couple stuff with me. Turns out he wanted to keep me away from other aspects of his life because it would be less painful when we eventually broke up.
 
2) 

If I'm always the one to plan dates. I get it, as the female in the relationship I'm probably going to be the one doing most of the planning. But when a guy shows little to no effort to ever go out with me, it sends the message to me that you don't want to put that much effort into our relationship. Relationships aren't a one way street, and it doesn't take much effort to ask your gf if she wants to see a movie, or go for a walk in the park. 

3) 

Such an obvious one, but one I had to learn the hard way: if he ever pressures you to do anything sexual you don't want to do. This is usually a bright red flag that not only is this guy selfish in bed, he's also selfish in relationships. "
"I think there's got to be a special place in hell for the kinds of women that put toilet paper on a seat and then LEAVE IT THERE for the next woman to remove. Like it's so f**cking dirty that you think your princess hands can leave it for ME to take off? Lady, the only part of me that needed to touch this was my a$$ and now YOU'VE made me use my hands.

Also, I've noticed some women will stall at the washroom door as they leave to make someone else open it so they can pass through. 

You think you're better than me?! 
Honestly though, this only happens to me every year or two so I need to calm down..."
Ok the way that you wrote this makes it sound like a guy is going around telling another guy that that other guy has a big dick.  
Crop tops. They can come back in style when I achieve my six pack. 
"I can sometimes predict the rain.

*What's that? The weatherman says there's a 30% chance of rain today? Well the pain in my leg tells me it will rain. Better believe me.*"
"Yeahhhh. As a teenager I can see being friends with someone like that because high school is hell, but as an adult, that person would be cut out of my life. How do you trust someone with judgments like that? "
"In hs there was a handsome guy who made some sexist and racist comment. He got flack for it and apologized. All the girls said they understood and fawned over him. 

An ugly guy yelled at all of them. He said the o nly reason they were so quick to forgive the racist was because he was handsome. And that if he, the ugly guy said that he would be a piarrhea at school. Everyone in class agreed with him but handsome racist guy remained popular. "
"It slowed down at first but we both really wanted kids, and as cheesy as it sounds when your happiness is magnified you're getting laid. Remaining somewhat perverse with kids around is a fun challenge, you become a master of double entendre. You also have to hide each other sometimes or kids go bananas. When our kids were little I'd take them to somewhere like Great Wolf Lodge and they'd think it was just us going, but we'd also get the adjoining room and my husband would show up when they were asleep. Seeing their dad in the morning was like ""Whoaaaaaaa magic where did you come from??"" and of course the answer to that was ""Ask your mom, she knows where I come from!"" Things you can say when your kids are 8 and 3. Now that they're older it requires more creativity."
"I had a guy play me a soulful, acoustic version of hotline bling on his guitar...it was the only time I've been serenaded that wasn't terrible because it was hilarious. 10/10 "
I had a guy who in the very early stages of dating (less than 1 month of seeing each other) would call me to ask if I missed his dick. It was off putting and hilarious at the same time. 
More peen would be nice. And not just any peen. Big peen. Prominent peen. Peen that stays on your mind for a couple days 
"I was raised in a big family. It takes a LOT to gross me out, and I always have to check with people ""is this okay, or is this something that crosses the line?"" I think my boundaries and stuff are a bit messed up regarding double-dipping and most germy-food-things"
"""I miss you not being around."""
The near constant rape plot points. 
I'm excellent at cooking boiled eggs to my exact liking of done-ness. 
"No offense, but Natalie Holloway comes directly to mind.  She was an attractive (wealthy) white girl from a nice family who went missing.  Other folks go missing all the time, but we don't have 24/7 media coverage...because (IMHO), they aren't as attractive as she and her family are.  "
"I have similar stories; I think I'm pretty now but I was always very shy and fat when I was younger. It was made much worse by having an absolutely stunning twin sister. I mean, we were two different species back then and everyone knew it. The amount of times she was invited along and I was left behind is uncountable. I could be standing right next to her and guys would just pretend I didn't exist. I remember walking down a mostly empty hallway with her and two guys we knew came around the corner, and whistled at her, then looked at me and very audibly said ""Not you."" I remember a boy getting pushed into me in a hallway and telling his friend ""Stop pushing me into ugly people."" 

It sucked a lot. "
"Carry on the family name

its her purpose in life

obliged to do so once married

selfish not to"
Yzma from the Emperor's New Groove. 
"""You're so lucky no one will ever like you for your looks.""

Crushed me in middle school, hilarious now. "
