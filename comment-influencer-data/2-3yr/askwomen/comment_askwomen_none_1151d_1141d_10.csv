He knows some shit but he better shut the fuck up and remember that snitches don't get treats.
"I'm in the camp of if you want something ask for it. When I was online dating, I messaged first most often. If I wanted a date, I asked him on a date. If I wanted to make out, I'd kiss the guy. If I wanted more, I asked for more. Generally speaking, I got what I asked for."
"***Edit***

OK, since this comment has become so popular I decided to edit out a lot of the details because I don't want it to be too obvious in case someone involved reads this.

So here's the vague tl;dr.

My coworker is one of two ""bridesmen"" in a wedding. He is friends with both the bride and groom. During the bachelorette party a few weeks ago, the bride hooked up with the other bridesman (not my coworker.) My coworker found out and threatened to tell the groom if the bride didn't fess up. She tells my coworker that she told the groom everything and the wedding is still on. My coworker is unconvinced that she's telling the truth, and feels really guilty for not telling the groom himself. The wedding is this weekend. (Cue dramatic music)

**UPDATE** So my coworker was back today and I got to ask him how the wedding went. Basically nothing big or dramatic went down. According to one of the groomsmen, the groom did find out about the cheating, almost called off the wedding but decided to go through with it. Bride is not allowed to speak to the cheating partner ever again. Couple seems happy but coworker says ""I give it five years.""

Fairly anticlimactic ending to a whole lotta drama."
We had a daycare at our school for the students who had kids. It was actually a great program because mothers could stay in school and learn how to take care of their kid for credit. 
"There was a cow field next door and the cows occasionally got loose and wandered through campus so we had a designated ""cow committee"" made up of teachers and administrators to deal with them. "
"Happened to one of my friends. His girl got pregnant and he totally was there for her. Got them a place to live, took her to all of her doctors appointment's, was overall a GREAT guy. The baby comes and it's black. He and her are both white. He was in complete denial. Wouldn't even listen to anyone when they pointed out the obvious. At about one and a half years old he finally can't take it anymore and gets a DNA test. The results come back and he is not the father. She was a piece of shit mom and he loved the daughter. I don't think the real father even knew or if he did he didn't care. My friend ended up getting sole custody of a child that's not even his and fathers her like she is his own. He's had her for about eight years now. "
"Okay...one of my fellow managers (F 38) is pregnant by a former coworker (M 19). That alone is no big deal, older women have gotten pregnant by younger guys before.

The JUICY part is that everyone thinks it's the managers current boyfriend's (M 29) child, but we did the math together and she knows it's not his, he was in jail at the conception date.  

Manager and coworker are white. Current boyfriend is black. I'm anxiously awaiting the due date. "
"My boyfriend and I both accidentally tricked each other into becoming an official couple on our first date.

While on the date, he innocently made a comment about how he couldn't believe I'd only had three boyfriends in my life. He himself was/is the third person I've dated, so I teasingly asked if he was counting himself as the third boyfriend already. He got adorably flustered and said ""Only if you'll have me."" I said ""Of course,"" and we kissed and had ice cream : )"
"I would seriously hope that he wouldn't tell my husband that sometimes instead of actually doing yoga, I lightly bounce on the yoga ball and watch YouTube for an hour while eating dry packs of ramen."
"We're not poor anymore now, but back when my boyfriend and I had a very low income we were told that we shouldn't buy soda or chocolate.

Also at one point someone said our priorities were wrong because we had a television. When we explained that we didn't pay for the TV (it was given to us by my cousin who'd bought a new one), we were informed that we should have pawned it and bought some rice and vegetables with the money.

Edit: we were not on food stamps or any sort of government assistance but I don't see what difference it would've made if we were. Just because someone is poor doesn't mean they should be deprived of a sweet treat or entertainment or whatever... when your life is shit you need *something* nice every now and then."
"Mine is only 2 so I'm sure there's more to learn in the future, but right now the way gender roles really come into play for little boys amazes me. I mean, I remember being a little girl and sure there were people tsking about being ladylike and such, but I was a tomboy for a long time and that was pretty much OK. But I find a lot more people get weirded out about gender role transgressions for little boys. For example I got him a baby doll since he was fascinated with a friend's baby doll, which sparked numerous conversations with friends and family about if they'd ""let"" their son play with a baby doll, and most of these people I think to be pretty progressive. Or discussing if a brightly colored unisex shirt is too much like a little girl's shirt and maybe I should change him. Or even once with a balloon animal maker where the choice was between a sword and a flower balloon. He chose a flower and the first response from the balloon person was to question if he really wanted a sword instead. 

I know I'd probably have different stories if I was raising a little girl, but I guess it surprised me how much it seems like our idea of what a little girl can like and be into has changed while it feels like the same has not happened for little boys. "
"Kind of typical, but I really enjoy how Tina Belcher portrays being sexually curious as an awkward teenager. I feel like teenage girls are portrayed on television in two ways: popular, beautiful, and sexually active; or awkward, shy, nerdy, and basically uninterested in their sexuality. 
As a former teenager who was more like Tina, I appreciate the portrayal.  
There's something uncomfortable about being sexually curious as a teenager, but not feeling like you're supposed to be."

"""You must be good at math!"" I'm an accountant, Excel does all of my math for me and even then 90â„… of that math is just addition and subtraction. What I AM good at is understanding tedious procedures and filling out forms.

And as I wind down my bartending career, I'd like to make it known that the majority of other bartenders I've worked with over the last decade were all in long term relationships if not married with kids. Flirting with us is fun but not going to achieve anything."
"Dating. I've never been on a ""date"" in my life. All my boyfriends have been people I met at school and became friends with until it naturally progressed into a relationship."
"I think there should be an app where if you go to an event (concert, movie, etc) alone, you can set preferences for someone to join you. Then the app finds someone whose preferences match yours and allows you to connect. Then you have a friend for the day. Like platonic Tinder but more discerning. 

Edit: So many cool suggestions and ideas! 

For the sake of being clear about exactly what I imagine, I'm talking about an app that specifically finds people at the same event who are also there alone and looking for someone to chill with during the show. "
"""She orders pizza whenever male human is gone and NEVER SHARES IT WITH ME.""  -dog"
"I've been screamed at many times for buy vegetables, fruit and dairy products. Apparently they're ""luxuries that aren't for struggling people"", particularly the fruit. It makes people really angry."
That I work from 9 to 3 and my job is easy. I'm a teacher. Everyone thinks they know exactly what my job entails because they have been a student. Actually the classroom is only one aspect of the job and you as a student don't see the rest of it.
"Pretty much after the first one. We were basically inseparable after that night, got engaged about a year later and married 5 months after that. We will celebrate our 14th anniversary in a couple of weeks. "
"Tossing a fistful of Cheerios on the carpet by my feet, for my 1-year-old to eat. Hey sometimes, she's freaking out and throwing a fit, I'm trying to get something important done, and I know it will distract her for awhile as she hunts for them all..."
It's given me a new appreciation for the tags that come on baby pajamas declaring that the clothing is not flame retardant.
As a teenager I was really happy Daria existed. I was angsty and frumpy and so many teenage role models were pretty and fashionable and popular. Daria was a reminder that there isn't one mold in society.
"Ugh. The amount of masturbation that I do whenever I have a day off. 

I have to lock her outside of the room when I do it because when I orgasm she comes running over and jumps on my chest. So she would be angrily ranting about that, I'm sure"
"That's really good. My high school kicked pregnant girls out to the alternative school, which was usually reserved for kids who got expelled for violence, drug use, or delinquency. It was so so sad to put them in a more dangerous school just to keep appearances up at the regular high school :(

I know the school was still doing this as of 2013 too. I'm not talking about the 1950s. "
"Speech-Language Pathologist here. We do more than work on teaching kids to say their /r/ sound, though that may be an important part of a pediatric therapist job! We also help children with Autism learn to communicate, work with students who stutter, and help kids learn to have conversations and tell stories so they can form relationships with others. SLPs in hospitals and nursing homes do a lot of work with swallowing diagnostics and therapy, as well as working on communication and cognition. "
"My observation with my son is that he likes to have his basic needs met first, specifically food.  Only when that need is satisfied, he will deal with social interactions like answering any questions on how school was, etc.  I finally clued in that if I wanted my husband's complete attention on something important, his basic needs must also be met first (not just food, i'm afraid)."
"I was hospitalized for a substantial period of time with a nasty strain of viral pneumonia.  When I applied to financial assistance for medical bills, they got me on food stamps right away.

The first time I went shopping, there was a crazy good deal on fresh strawberries, so I bought two quarts.  It was the first time I used my SNAP card, and I asked the cashier for help.  As soon as she heard I was on benefits, the woman behind me in line started making snide comments about how I was having strawberries on her taxpayer dime.

In the same idea, I helped out at a food pantry, and the one volunteer always found issue with the people we were helping.  There was a guy came in and asked if we could help him buy good work boots.  He had just gotten a manual labor job and couldn't afford steel tips which were required.  The volunteer argued that he should get a job and pay for it himself, totally not realizing how little logic that made.  He literally encouraged the guy to bootstrap himself!"
"Jessica Jones.  Her jeans don't fit her well.  They're saggy in the ass. She wears a tank top, falls asleep in the tank top, then gets out of bed and never changes the tank top. The only time she's she looks the typical, overly glamorous woman that media expects is when an evil man makes her. "
"Pop pimples, eat a diet consisting mostly of simple carbs, stay up too late on Reddit, stay in bed too long, eat junk food in bed, drink soda, sleep with make up on, never wear sunscreen, speed, carry credit card debt that I could (and SHOULD) pay off, spend money on things I will misplace in a week, spend money on beauty products I'll rarely use. 

Damn. I need to get my shit together. 
Thank you for asking such a self-revelatory question. "
"Man I love talking shit.

So one of my friends got married to a guy five years younger than her last month, he recently turned 21, at the same exact place she and her ex had planned to get married at just this past November. She's a honeymoon phase dater and me and my girlfriend are sitting here wondering what's going to happen next. "
Absolutely.  I can see how males don't have the same emotional support systems.  The societal pressures they are put under can be crushing. 
"Mine: people who are obsessed with ""not wasting the day"" by which they mean cramming as many activities in as possible and then telling everyone about it. 

I'm sure my aversion to that would be a dealbreaker for some! "
"Religious-focused abstinence only sex ed in a public high school.

In 5th grade we got a video on how puberty works, but from that point on the only sex ed at my school was this Christian motivational speaker who would come every year and tell stories about how, for example, Fifi the poodle down the street wasn't willing to wait for the love of another purebred dog so she had sex with a junkyard mutt and had ugly mutt puppies and then her true love didn't want her.

When people talked about Texas having abstinence-only sex ed on the news, this is what I thought they meant. I thought every public school in Texas was getting something like this. It wasn't until I was in college that I found out that a) lots of schools in my state still got REAL sex ed and b) even the ones that got abstinence-only usually got the ""look at this picture of herpes"" kind instead of ""every time you have sex you rip a chunk off your heart and give it away forever"".

I'm 30, and I've since educated myself via internet and experience... but every once in a while I still run across something in my head from that ""class"" that I'm not sure if its true or not."
"I can make sex jokes in most situations without coming off as rape-y or threatening. Hanging around a playground all day is totally ok. People trust me with children generally. No one asks me to lift things. Wet panties seem like a nice, discreet alternative to a visible erection. "
"After about our fourth or fifth  date, my now husband asked me if I wanted to be his girlfriend. I thought I was his girlfriend. I said yes and didn't ask for clarification about my confusion until several months later. Apparently he was seeing other women until those first 5 dates, so, yeah, umm clarify.

This was 12 years ago. I don't think there is any confusion now."
"My very masculine male coworker flirted with me non stop until he went out one night with me and my boyfriend at the time. We all went back to my place and partied with my roommate for a bit until coworker said he was going to get more beer. So my bf and I hang out for a bit and eventually I am wondering where coworker is, it's been almost an hour and he left his phone on my couch, my roommate happened to leave his in my room as well. So I go out, knock on my roommates door in case he's in there, I don't get a response so I figure he's sleeping already. I leave the phones out on the table and go back to my room, confused and wanting to go to bed but don't want to wake up to coworker pounding on the door.

Roommate comes out and asks me if I need something, I explain the phones and situation. Roommate takes coworkers phone and claims it is his burner phone. I go with his flow because Reasons, and he heads back to his room, before he closes the door he says a few things to me, and i see my coworker move from one end of the room to the other, hiding, and naked. 

I was sure I pretended I didn't see anything but I got a note at 3a slid under the door titled, ""DON'T ACT LIKE YOU KNOW"" and a few lines about how coworker is still in the closet and was freaking out on my roommate afraid I saw or heard him. 

So I've kept his secret, even though it's 2016 and you would think no one would care, but I respect and love him and when he's ready to talk I'll be ready to listen. "
"Being firmly for or against having kids. I know there are some women here who are on the fence but I think that for the most part you see users who know for sure what they want, and who have known for years. It makes me jealous. I wish I knew what I wanted too!"
You HAVE to come back with updates.
That is a good dad.
"In Australia, we went into lockdown because of snakes multiple times."
"Standards. So many times when I was struggling financially, when I was walking home with groceries or waiting for the bus, some guy would start hitting on me by offering me a ride. And they seemed honestly shocked that I didn't want to climb in the car with a stranger. Or talk to them. Or give them my number. 

All poor women don't need to be rescued. And we don't have to be automatically grateful if you try. "
"We had several (four) teacher couples over the time that my sisters and I went to school that had originally been teacher-student couples, which is just not something that had occurred to me as being unusual/gross until long after graduation. It's just super weird that a: the teachers dated the students, b: they stayed together and the students became teachers too, and c: they ended up working in the same school together."
"I mostly have black underwear, but I feel like all of my panties eventually become period panties. It's the natural lifecycle."
I think external genitalia is a poor design choice. 
"Ooh the TV one always gets me. I already can't afford to go out and do shit, now you're telling me I don't deserve to watch the news? And hell, I'd get $40 if I sold that thing. That wouldn't get me very far towards whatever frankly privileged moral crusade you're campaigning for "
"I'm a zookeeper. Everyone thinks that we play with animals all day. In reality we spend about 25% of our day feeding and training the animals (which admittedly is pretty awesome) and the other 75% is paperwork, meetings and cleaning up a lot of shit. 

One of the most annoying things about my job has been when people have said things like, ""See [child], that's why you go to college!"" or ""Good luck getting a boyfriend going home and smelling the way that you do"". First of all, this day and age, most zookeepers have college degrees. Second, it's just rude. Luckily not all guests are like that but still... on a bad day it can really get to you.

I do go home smelling pretty rank on some days but that just means that I worked hard, which is a pretty satisfying feeling. I actually don't mind the smell of most animal poop- you honestly get used to it. I've spent a lot of time weighing fecal samples for our endocrinologist so that our lab can monitor hormone levels so that we can track pregnancies in our animals. It's pretty fascinating stuff and it's amazing that we can use science to decide how to manage our animals.

That's the coolest thing about being a zookeeper. You never stop learning. We are scientists, animal behaviorists, woodworkers, horticulturalists, plumbers, electricians, trainers, conservationists, and so much more. You can focus on what you are interested in to become a more well rounded team. 

We attend conferences and visit other zoos and talk to other zookeepers about the problems that we have. There are facebook groups where keepers share the cool new enrichment item that they built and talk about what else they can do to improve their animals' lives. We are a passionate bunch and I know tons of keepers that volunteer in their spare time, and a few that have their own charities.

It's not an easy job and we get paid absolute shit to do it, but every keeper that I know is proud to do what they do. It's a shame that more of the public didn't realize what it is that we do- especially in these times of Blackfish and PETA trying to ""expose"" zoos for ""torturing"" animals. Zoos do a lot for endangered species- I myself have worked with multiple species that has been declared extinct in the wild (bontebok, scimitar horned oryx, and addax- all gorgeous species of antelope) and if it weren't for their species being bred in captivity, they would be gone. We are going to breed our addax soon and hopefully one day their offspring, or their offspring's offspring, can be reintroduced back into the wild."
How much I *actually* spend time picking my nose. 
perhaps your son is just a great believer in Maslow's hierarchy of needs
"- that everyone who works in a library is a librarian. Librarians have Masters' degrees in Library Science. Most of the people working in the library are staff who don't hold MLIS degrees.

- that working in a library is great because you can read all day/be surrounded by books, etc. Working public service in the library is a lot like working retail: you interact with tons of people, it can be busy and stressful, and you have to work with a huge diverse community with lots of different needs."
"So basically...you shouldn't get healthy food because you're not affluent?

 But if you listened and bought processed food I bet they'd tell you you're wasting your money on crap and you should be buying real food instead.  Ugh."
I don't choose my period panties. My period panties choose me.
"I watched a pretty great video about a Canadian Street nurse who works with homeless people. They talked about how a fair amount of homeless people had cellphones. People I know have been angry when someone has begged them for change, when they're holding a cellphone. You'd think that really wouldn't be a necessity when you don't have your basic needs met, but even homeless people have families, friends, and could need it for getting a job, etc. It's hard to see things from another person's perspective sometimes."
"Guys seem to get turned on by having their existence ignored and being told to fuck off, I can't imagine why else they keep on trying. "
"So all my friends feel the need to confide their secrets in me. Hopefully this isn't too confusing. 


Guy A is married to Girl A

Guy B is dating Girl B

Guy C is my good friend 

Girl C is my friend and old roommate 


Guy A is sleeping with Girl C

Girl A is sleeping with Guy B

And Girl B is sleeping with Guy C


They're the worst but the fill my daily quota of drama

"My family had financial woes when I was growing up. Money meant a lot. One day, my mum lost $100. Now, that doesn't seem like a lot but that's essentially 2 weeks worth of food for us back then. She thought my brother or I stole it. We were made to kneel in front of the ancestral shrine until one of us confessed. We kneeled for 12 hours straight with at least a dozen bouts of heavy spankings with a wooden ruler in between. Finally, my brother caved and told my mum he stole it to buy his friends gifts. We were beaten quite badly for our indiscretion and made to go to sleep without any food. 

A day later, my mum found the $100 in the dirty laundry. She never apologized to us. I still remember that experience to this day. "
"Not just on AW but with women in general with the whole bras being uncomfortable and taking your bra off as soon as you get home feeling. Like apart from when I'm in bed I can't not wear a bra because I feel uncomfortable and ugh without one. 

I get that some bras can be painful but if you get one that's the right size and fits well then it shouldn't be uncomfortable at all. I barely feel like I'm wearing mine."
"I'm on the high end of promiscuous.

The most important and easily overlooked first step: 
**Figure out what exactly you are looking for. Not the kind of person you think you want, but what you want out of a sexual experience.** Because that really *really* affects how successful your search and encounters will be. Do you want a quick and dirty regular fuck with a guy who knows what he's doing? Do you want to explore your sexuality with someone else also looking to explore theirs? Are you attracted strongly to either Dominating or being Dominated? Would you like a regular sexual partner and repeat sex, or prefer to explore with different one night stands?

How you go about searching for a partner depends on what you want. I actually like OKCupid for this. I state directly on my profile the exact kind of casual encounter I'm looking for, and then sort through the messages to see who is equally direct with me and seems to also want what I want.

For someone I meet in person, once I think I feel chemistry, I pretty much just tell them: ""So, I can be overly direct, feel free to tell me off if you'd like. I think you're fucking hot and I'd like to [x, y, z] with you. If you'd be interested, let me know."" Then I return to whatever our previous conversation was and let them follow up if they want."
"Being confrontational.  Don't like what that person said to you?  Tell them.  Someone wronged you?  Tell them.  

I am not a very confrontational person and have difficulty communicating my feelings to others in case they judge me for it."
"Fresh Off The Boat represented my childhood really well. My Asian immigrant mother is almost a carbon copy of Jessica Huang with her high expectations for her kids. My siblings and I were expected to get good grades, she was really nit-picky on the small stuff, extremely frugal and we had to attend extra tutoring classes beyond our normal schoolwork.

I rarely get to see Asian characters so fleshed out and actually have a personality. We're usually relegated to nerds, scientists, doctors, martial arts experts, nail salon people or random foreigners."
"I liked donuts *before* I was a cop. Also, who doesn't like donuts anyway? 

Edit: To the angry person who reported this, yes men are allowed to answer.  It's even in the rules.  If you don't want the answers, see the flair and skip."
My small boobs. I definitely thought that every guy wanted giant ones and I was insecure about it for the longest time. 
"A lot of people here seem to only date within their social circle, but I actually don't like doing that. I prefer not to date friends or friends of friends. Just gets awkward to me, especially if things don't work out."
"A charity app that lets you and your friends volunteer on an as-needed basis with local organizations whenever you find yourself bored with a few hours to kill. The basic format would be for low-risk work like cleaning parks or working at a food bank or an animal shelter. Filling out a more detailed profile and passing a background check would let you work at YMCA or Boys and Girls Clubs if someone needed, say, a last-minute backup tutor or someone to run the soccer game."
"Mine is kind of sad/infuriating. 

When I was in high school, my best friend's step sister was molested by two boys in her grade during a school dance. She said they sandwiched her between them and felt her up. She told a teacher, who in turn took it to the principle, and the two boys were kicked out of the school.

Years later, my best friend's family had a get together where her step sister got really drunk and admitted to her that she had lied about the entire thing. She had willingly grinded with them, but then felt bad about it and didn't want word to get out to her boyfriend at the time. So she told people they had forced themselves on her. 

Her step sister was always a shady chick, always doing scummy things. But I never thought she would take it so far."
Some men believe in life after love I guess
Probably wear a bra less because I wouldn't be worrying about my nipples showing through clothes. I'd also wear glitter for everyday wear more often 
"Not sure if it's uncommon, but I like to see how they act at all levels of drunk before entering any type of relationship. I've been with people who are totally nice and funny after a few drinks, but at the end of the night turn into complete monsters."
"""Oh wow, mom's purring! Cuddle time!"""
"I'm a divorced father of a 17.5 year old young man and for the most part my ex is out of my son's life. He lives with me (occasionally she makes interruptions but mostly it's just me.) I currently feel with him in the following way regarding sex:

*  Have sex if and when you can, because sex is an awesome human thing that most people really enjoy. 
*  If possible, please be a respectful roommate and don't have sex at bad times (when we have family or friends over). (This is part of a larger conversation we have as he transitions into adulthood about living with me and being a roommate, rather than a parent-child relationship.)
*  Use protection. Anything you need to facilitate that, I either have or will buy for you. 
*  Try to keep the noise to a minimal and/or schedule things so I can be out of the house.
*  Really try to avoid the crazy/drama. I don't want to deal with pregnancy/jilted lovers/angry parents/cops etc.
*  Be respectful to your partners and treat them like humans, not like life-support systems for sex organs.

The way I facilitate this is by the following:

*  Being a positive role model. I am single and I date and sometimes have sex at home.
*  I discuss aspects of my love life with my son, in attempt to show him that people should be treated respectfully and that sometimes we make mistakes, but we own them.
*  Regularly talk about stds, the need for testing and what to do if something comes back positive.
*  Finally I try to provide non-judgemental guidance and wisdom whenever my son asks for my help in relationships/sex/etc."
"So. One of my friends became this 40 year old guy's mistress when she was 19. The guy has a wife and kids. My friend and him were coworkers. 

The wife found out, but my friend continued to see him for about a year until their work found out and told them they both need to leave. This time, the guy decided to choose his family over my friend, and got a new job. He became *my* coworker. He has no idea I'm friends with his former mistress."
"""Having strawberries on the taxpayer dime"". What a ridiculous sentiment. She probably would have been pissed if she saw anything in your cart - you can't win with some people."
"People comment on my voice all the time, which is strange. Men have said it's ""soothing and sexy."" I have a deep voice, and I cringe whenever I hear it on a recording. I guess my deep, Cher voice is sexy. Who woulda thunk it?!"
"I'm an executive assistant. No, I don't sleep with my boss or steal money from the company for my own personal gain."
"I wouldn't care about my body hair. I'm Mexican and Italian, so my body hair is black and abundant. I would let my booty hair blow freely in the wind without giving any fucks."
"dude she wants to ditch the V-card, let's put the 50 shades back on the lamps haha. I'd think, although I haven't been on OKC, that advertising that you're trying to dehymenate yourself is going to bring in only creeps. I'm surprised you don't deal with more creeps.
"
Its 98 degrees outside. I wear loose dresses and knee-high skirts to work while my male coworkers wear khaki pants and button-downs. 
"Childhood best friend and her husband became born-again Catholics after going to pre-marital counseling. They were a damn mess together before this. Well, this evolved into them becoming hardcore conservative and racist. They're the people on Facebook who posts bible quotes one day, then racist memes the next. Pisses me off beyond belief because I'm a minority, and she always stood up for me when we were kids. 

What her husband and parents don't know is, in high school, she secretly dated a mutual friend who is black. She didn't get her license until after high school, so I would always help her and her boyfriend sneak around. They dated for 3-4 years, and after breaking up, she started dating another black guy. 

Based on what I've seen her husband post on social media, he absolutely would divorce her if knew. Her parents would likely disown her (her older sister is married to a guy who is half-Mexican ... the shit they used to say about him and probably still do). I've been tempted so many times to comment about this when she posts one of her memes on Facebook. Ended up just blocking her instead. Still tempted though."
"Thankfully, a lot of the sexism I read about here seems to be US-specific. I live in Germany, public nudity in parks and on beaches is part of the culture here, nobody makes a fuss about breastfeeding mothers in public. I never got slut-shamed by a gynecologist and abortions are a standart procedure for those who need them.

It horrifys me to read about pro-lifers who assault women at Planned Parenthood Centers, misinformed Senators, boyfriends obsessed with sexual history and the endless breastfeeding-discussion... 

American women are brave troopers for putting up with all that shit!


Also, what the fructose are cardboard-applicators for? I never saw those before in a store and don't know anyone who uses them."
"I was a sales associate for a while after I moved to NY while I got back on my feet. A customer went off about my tattoos and ear piercings (one set of holes) and how I was wasting his tax money. Thankfully the shift lead stood up for me at that point and told the guy he was out of line, but I'd still keep driving if I ever saw the guy stranded on the side of the road.

Since the tattoo I got was $50 when I was 18, it would be a waste of money to have removed, and my ears got pierced for my 12th birthday. The holes have since grown shut. How am I wasting money with these?

Oh, right, old rich white men are allowed to tell me what to do with my body, even when I'm *not* on state insurance. How could I possibly forget that?"
"Yeah exactly. We got shit for having a computer too. Bonus, my boyfriend is a programmer. Without that computer we would have had NO INCOME AT ALL. But no we should have sold it and bought rice and vegetables. It's always rice and vegetables."
I've been told that the occasional metal detectors and the frequent backpack searches as we entered were weird. Also we couldn't carry any bags/backpacks from class to class.
Are you implying a dragon is a mere *lizard*? Are you TRYING to wake the dragon?
"His social media presence. If they overshare or just kind of embarrassing/cringey online in general, that's a dealbreaker to me."
"We weren't allowed to have our own book bags in school. They had to be clear plastic ones that the school provided. It was so weapons and drugs couldn't be brought into the school. If you brought any other bag, even a gym bag if you do extracurricular sports for example, it was confiscated til the end of the day. 

Someone was once stabbed in the neck with a pair of scissors and I saw someone straight up do cocaine in class. 

So you know. Didn't work. It sucked too because those bags were made of very cheap material and ripped all the time. I can share pics if anyone is curious. "
Sephora's birthday gift is pretty much the only one I get every year.
"I was standing in line at the grocery store I worked at with a  starbucks Frappuccino--you know the kind that is bottled--when one of our regular customers came up behind me, saw what I was buying, got clearly agitated and angry and told me that I shouldn't be wasting the little bit of money I make on something as silly as that.

I just looked at him like he had grown a third head. I mean really WTF? I couldn't believe he had the audacity to even think that let alone say it."
"One of my friends (28, f) found another friend's mom (40) on OkCupid. At first they didn't know they had her son in common and no one knew the mom was into women at all. The son still doesn't know but I do because my friend texted me the mom's photo which she sent her before they decided to meet up. I didn't manage to tell her it's other friend's mom before they met up and had sex. They continued seeing each other and are crazy in love So now I know a guy friend's mom is into women and that she's sleeping with her son's friend.For anyone maybe possibly confused why mom would be on OKC publicly if she's not out, it's common for non-hetero people to have no profile pics here, or half-face pics, etc, and then only send photos privately."
2 of my friends were in a 3 way together with one of their boyfriends. They say they don't want anybody to know but it seems like an awful lot of people doâ€¦so I'm questioning the juiciness of this gossip...
"My dog would snitch and still expect treats. I DID GOOD RIGHT CAN I HAVE A BONE?

"I'd rather there not be actual, speaking witnesses who can attest to how much time I spend parked in front of the TV, binge-watching Netflix. Or to how often I'll put away a bottle of wine alone. Although, if you're with two talking cats, are you really alone? "
"When you move, regardless of how far you're going, have toilet paper ready and also some garbage bags. 

What I usually do is load a tall garbage can with all the bathroom stuff (shower curtain, hand soap, etc), toilet paper, water, and garbage bags, and bring that in first. 

Don't forget a plunger for each bathroom, either! "
"poor people aren't allowed to have any kind of ''non necessity'' if any ''necessity'' is unmet, no matter how out of reach it is. the logic is especially hard to follow if the necessity costs a ridiculous amount of money up front

for example ''so your family can't afford to fix the house plumbing for thousands of euros, but they can afford internet/cable/cell phones/cigarettes? something doesn't add up here, you must be lying!''"
"Nothing too juicy, but my SO and I are both students on clinical rotations. On my last rotation, I worked with this awesome PA. She was really chatty and outgoing, and we had a lot of downtime so lots of time was spent listening to her gossip with coworkers. Often she would talk about this horrible breakup she went through less than a year ago. She had bought a house with her fiancee but then he cheated on her and started dating someone else. Nothing too juicy, but it was definitely still raw.

About midway through the rotation, my SO started telling me about an odd situation at his rotation. One of the PAs he was working with had this awkward relationship with a tech. They'd be all over each other at work and stuff. Someone filled him in and told him that he'd been engaged, living with his fiancee, but then cheated on her and left her for the tech.

I was like, hmm....this sounds awfully familiar. Turned out we were talking about the same people. The medical community can be quite small."

"A previous gf had a kid at a young age. Baby's daddy is her ex bf and is no where to be found. After dating for a long while she told me the whole story.

Apparently her ex and one of his friends gang raped her by trying her to her bed, for 2 days.  Messed her up really good, was a complete wreck for long time and leaves her with a baby. Years later the friend of her ex looks her up, crying, apologizing, and asking her to get the kid DNA tested, go to the police, and let him confess.  She goes through with the DNA test but declines going to the police as she would rather the kid be fatherless then have to deal with knowing her mom was raped.

Icing on the cake is that the ex and his friend are gay lovers, but in the closet still.

edit: didn't even notice this was in /r/askwomen, but for clarity, I'm a dude."
I generally try to wear underwear that is older and/or darker when I run the risk of staining them.
I have a *huge* crooked nose. An older German lady stopped me once and told me that I had the most beautiful profile and that my nose was a gift. I had to hold back my laughter but I did thank her. I always thought it was the weirdest thing. I don't think she was lying either because she was this tiny older lady with a thick accent and she seemed really sweet. I've always been made fun of for my nose so for even one person out there to say it was beautiful was so very weird to me.
"You know, I started off wanting a European dragon cuz that's my heritage, but when I ended up actually having a Chinese dragon, I got so excited.

First off, the money. Yeah, all I had to do was get a frog who swallows the dragon's spit and then the frog SPITS OUT GOLD COINS. Now I have a really hydrated dragon AND a house in Hawaii. It's a pretty sweet deal. 

Then my dragon started having sons, and I was like, ""WHOAH. Nine sons of the dragon? What's all this noise?"" Look, I know it sounds like a lot to handle, having 11 animals in the house, but they're so practical. 

He had a pulao and the pulao would cry out when anyone approaches with ill intent. Best house alarm system ever. 

Then he had a qiuniu, who plays music for me all the time so I can apply my iTunes gift cards straight to movies and tv show downloads. It's pretty sweet. 

Then he had a chiwen, who, no joke, swallows all the evil energy around my house. My ex-boyfriend is still being digested sarlac style. 

Oh my gosh, and the chaofeng? No one steals when you have a chaofeng on your roof, AND he can tell when you're lying to me. Between him and his brother the yazi, I'm safer than an encrypted iPhone in the basement of Fort Knox. 

I've got a bixi, who fills my libraries with books and stuff so I always have tons of trashy romance novels to read, and a bi'an, who handles all my legal affairs. My suanni provides a stable foundation for my house (I live in earthquake country) and my baxia always carries in my groceries. 

Man, I always thought I'd want a European dragon, but now that I have a Chinese dragon? I can't imagine anything else. "
"I don't think it's appropriate to be your ""full self"" all of the time.

I'm not at work to be a personality, I'm there to have people think I'm good at my job. In my field at least, you don't get promoted by being the fun, drunk person at after work drinks. I'm not saying be a robot, but your co-workers don't need to know everything about you, your hobbies, your relationship and your social life.

Equally, I don't need to discuss my political and social values with my co-workers when I know that it will benefit no one and we will both just end up frustrated, thinking the other person is an idiot.

I also think it's fine to not always feel ""comfortable"" in every goddamn social situation. "
"I'm over the ""love yourself through infinite selfies"" thing. 

I think the line between loving your body and feeling confident, and publicly seeking validation to lessen your insecurities is not that fine, and it's often the people I *know* are deeply insecure are the ones who post the most selfies. 

I don't think it's necessary to send your friends the same type of snaps you'd send your wannabe FBW/SO with the caption ""look how good I look"" or ""you're welcome"" with a picture of sex eyes and cleavage. There are better ways to love yourself, and I feel like people are too eager to reward anything a woman does out of her own free will because ""it's her choice and she has the right to choose what to do with her own body"". 

I think it's silly, and I'd rather see pictures of your pet. There are many other ways to love yourself, and while selfies are one of them, I'm over it. "
"His voice matters HUGE to me. If he has a weird voice to me, I will immediately end the relationship. It's not always the pitch or tone either, some voices are just so unattractive. "
"I hate this double standard so much. This kind of thing conditions boys to separate themselves from girls (before they even get to school, at which point they distance themselves completely because, ew). 

I don't mind being the defensive one when my little brother picks up a doll and someone else comments on it, but I do wish people would just realize that toys are toys. "
"This isn't a comment about a personal experience, but I remember reading a blog post written by a lady who had lost about 100 pounds. She said people were being much nicer to her and it really hurt her feelings, because why wouldn't they be nice when she weighed more. She asked her husband about it and he pointed out that since she had lost the weight she was less sarcastic and more affectionate. It turned out that before she had lost the weight she was shutting people out, and when she was smaller she finally felt like she could fit in and was being nicer, and other people were being nice in return. What I took from the blog is that there will always be people who are rude or whatever, but a lot of how people treat you is based on how you treat them and yourself. "
"My husband says I have the cutest and best chin, which I still have a hard time believing. My mom told me when I was younger that I had a witch's chin, kinda hard to get over that one."
"Dealing with random boners in high school would have given me a nervous breakdown. 

I also really enjoy dresses and wearing fun eye shadow colour palettes.

I am also very glad that I rarely have to stifle my emotions because of society's expectations. I enjoy having a good cry when a good cry is due. I find it very soothing and uplifting."
"Sometimes I say/think racist things because racism was so ingrained in the way I grew up. I used to say ""I'm not racist!"" but now I say, ""I'm trying hard to unravel destructive ideas I grew up with, but sometimes I'm racist. Please call me on my shit."""
"That I'll take your kids away. I'm a social worker.

In reality, I work with families to ensure they receive assistance in all areas that they need, and I work with them to promote positive relationships and healthy development in their kids. Yeah, I have to report suspected abuse or neglect, but then it turns into CPS's job to investigate, not mine. "
"From my experience, a lot of people on this subreddit have the mentality of ""judging others based on appearance is horrible and I never do it. Anyone who does is a piece of shit"". 

Well, I judge others on their appearances all the damn time. Not necessarily in a negative fashion (though sometimes I do - which again, it seems like nobody else on this subreddit *ever* does - I don't voice my comments but I definitely find myself thinking ""God, that looks awful,"" when I look at some people's choices in how they present themselves) but I think you can gain *some* clues as to what a person is like based on their appearance. In some cases I think it's foolish to ignore those clues."

"So I just love gossiping. I just HAVE to know and then I just HAVE to share. It's an issue. But thankfully my husband is the same way so we constantly gossip. 

My biggest one right now is the fact that my friends new husband (end of June) cheated on her before they got married. The whole dame time they were saying their vows of ""Do you promise to be faithful"" or ""care and love them no matter what"", all I could think was you c h e a t e d on her.

"It's usually combined with Information Science these days, and basically centres around  how to  best gather, organize and share information with the patrons  of your library, and the political and ethical ramifications of doing so. We spend a lot of time thinking about the information needs of the community,  what the best resources are to meet those needs,  and how to share them.  There's a fair bit if IT and management as well. 

 As for the political end of things, librarians take patron privacy really, really seriously ( at least in North America). A librarian developed the idea of the warrant canary, as a way of letting her patrons know that the FBI had requested someone's records under the Patriot Act.  That's an extreme example, but one of the five required courses in my degree revolved around discussions like that."

- Gay sex is never safe because gay people can't get married
- Anal sex causes AIDS
- Sperm can swim through two pairs of jeans and underwear, so dry humping is not safe
- Having premarital sex means you don't respect yourself and you have self-esteem problems
- Obama is trying to legalize murdering newborn babies
- Abortion is murder because fetuses have heartbeats and that makes them human

"I was searching Tumblr for Ghostbusters shit (cus am in love with Holtzmann) and it appears to be blowing up with posts calling Kate McKinnon a transphobe for very dubious reasons. Namely, that she played a caricature of a kid with gender dysphoria 10 years ago, and saying that she has never seen a penis when asked if she was lesbian.

Normally I ignore this shit, but dude... She is possibly the first gay character played by a gay actress in a mainstream kid-friendly movie, the first gay actress to have an action figure, she's done SO much for visibility in general (she pretty much always plays gay characters) - and they're calling her a bigot and boycotting her for something she did a decade ago with no ill-intentions. 

They've totally hijacked her hashtag on Tumblr and that makes me sad because hordes of baby gays are going to see that be turned off her, even though she's the amazing role model they need."

"Consent starts at a young age.  Teach him that no means to stop.  Always show respect to their body (ie, don't tickle him while he screams for you to stop, don't force him to hug Granma if he doesn't want to, etc).  As he ages, talk about manners and consent as things come up, ""you hugged your friend, and that's very sweet, but you should wait until he puts his arms out, too.  This makes sure he wants that hug.""  When he gets old enough to talk about sex and dating, he'll already have these ideas in his mind.  Reinforce by talking about it like it's totally normal, not some scary thing that only ""bad men' do.   Also, make it clear to him that silence is not consent.  ""You want your girl to be into you, not just going along with it.  Because if she's quiet and you do something, she might not like that and not want to go out with you anymore.""

"The most romantic date I've ever been on wasn't actually a date. I was pretty good friends with this guy who was GORGEOUS. I mean... literally everything you could want in a person, he was. I was 100% sure he only liked me as a friend though, and he was so awesome that I was completely okay with that. I never told him my feelings because, well, I knew he didn't feel the same and I didn't want to lose a great friend. 

ANYWAY we start hanging out more. Going to the movies, hanging out with his sister (all of us were in our 20s) together and just doing fun things. Running. Hiking. Whatever. Well one night he says, ""Hey, I know you're off tonight, do you want to go on an adventure!?"" Uh, heck freaking yes I do. 

We meet up and it's like... 9:00 at night. We go exploring this trail, end up running into some other people we know who hang with us for a little bit and then go on their way. He decides to make a fire because there is a perfect clearing for it that we descovered.The night is perfect, the stars are glorious, and we don't want to go home yet. I had two blankets in my car that I always keep in case of emergency so I grab those while he makes a fire. Then we lay on the blankets, next to this fire he used his old boyscout skills to make, and look at the stars and talk about... everything.

I'm having a grand ol' time with my ""great friend"". I'm even laying on his arm so that we can look at his phone (he had an app that showed the constilations) and then.. he puts the phone away and in a moment of silence, just looking at the starts he says, 
""So... do you want to kiss me as much as I want to kiss you?""

I was floored. I had been SO certain that he didn't see me that way... it was like finding out Santa wasn't real, only... you know... awesome. I stutter for a second and then say, ""I.... I had no idea you even liked me. Yes. I want to kiss you as bad as you want to kiss me, because I've liked you for YEARS, but I'm not going to right now.""

We didn't kiss that night. I had been raped fairly recently and just couldn't do it. What made the night even more romantic was that he didn't try to kiss me again that night. He understood and respected my no, instead of asking again. Which... I would have gotten scared at that point if he had asked and would have done it out of fear of escalation (trauma does weird things to the brain)

I know that may seem like a depressing end... but honestly it is one of my best memories. In a time when I felt all men deep down were horrible monsters that used you for sex... my friend cared for me as a person, respected my boundary even knowing that I *wanted* to kiss him and was just scared to, and showed me that men weren't monsters. It was a beautiful night."

I look at their profile and make sure there aren't any deal breakers, or anti-women sentiments (happens surprisingly often) and then I message back. 

Meet in a public place, even if you're just hooking up. Grab a coffee or something and make sure you feel comfortable and then see where the day/night leads. 

Why am I not embarrassed? What is there to be embarrassed about? I like having sex. I had sex. End of story. As long as you wrap it up you'll be fine.

"Riflery classes. I thought most Americans had this. Oh! And I started driver's ed. at 13, never taught to parallel park and still cannot do it at all. When parking is ample where you live, there's no need.... But then I moved -_-"
"One of the things I like most about Bob's is that the show *likes* the Belcher family. Their oddities and foolish decisions are usually the source of humor, but the tone is like the writers are making fun of their friends."
"We had some pretty awful teachers. I don't know if I'd say this is unusual, but still. I had one history teacher who regularly made racist and ableist jokes like ""what do you call a retarded Chinese kid? Sum Ting Wong HUR HUR HUR."" He also slut-shamed the girls regularly. On the first day of class he told us that the dress code wasn't unfair because girls who dress like sluts get treated like sluts, and you don't want to be treated that way, do you? He'd literally walk around the room and inspect us for dress code violations, and if he saw any cleavage whatsoever he'd make us put on a jacket or send us to the office. He made a lot of obnoxious sexist jokes like that women are the root of all evil because Eve was the one who ate the forbidden fruit and stupid shit like that. Just an all-around nasty, backwards person. And there were more like him, though I think he was probably the worst. "
Wow.... All these old married dudes with girlfriends and I can barely turn a doorknob in front of a woman.
So glad urea isn't a waste product and only champagne and chocolate sauce comes out of dicks!
"Oh holy shit I love this question. My gossip is actually work rather than social, but still.

Here we go.

- We have a young, pretty, and pleasant new intern at work, rumor is that the manager who hired her (mid-30s) actually found her on Bumble and recruited her from there.

- Went out with a group of coworkers and my coworker's (in his late-30s) girlfriend showed up to ""hang out"" toward the end of the night. I was surprised to see her there, because I actually recognized her as a friend of my 21-year-old niece.

- A coworker of mine was sleeping with another coworker. It ended badly, and she ended up quitting. He is now sleeping with another coworker, who happens to have same first name."
"Some dude once told me he thought my zits were cute... wtf.

"I feel the same way towards Tina! Her ""erotic friend fiction"" hit close to home for me since I did something similar in my youth to explore my crushes since it wasn't happening in real life lol. It's kind of played for laughs but her dreams combining sexuality and zombies are also really affirming for weird kinks you might have growing up. "
"Someone made a dick joke to me once because of my username. ""Yeah I bet your tiny is mighty, bro"" or something like that. It was in a discussion about dick size, like I was saying that it's mostly men who worry about that and most women don't care. I guess he assumed I was a guy with a small dick. "
"Being religious.

I'm a staunch atheist. I have no problem with my religious friends or family whatsoever, but I would be unable to share a life with someone who was even moderately religious. I would be unable to share that very important part of their lives, and I would find extreme difficulty in seeing them pray, go to church etc. I feel that, over time, we would grow apart."
But eating healthy foods can make you healthier and therefore reduce your chances of having a heart attack because you lived on cheap bread products! You're actively reducing your so-called burden on the tax payer by eating things with vitamins!
"Homeless people in my city have started getting smart phones because you can get hand-me-downs from previous generations insanely cheaply and there are enough wireless hotspots in cities that they can get free wifi easily.  Some people self-righteously complain about it, but it seems like a fantastic investment to me.  With the internet you have an easier time finding information on public assistance, finding a job, contacting friends and family, etc.  The internet has pretty much ceased being a luxury in modern western society.  And even if it was just for entertainment, so what?  When did Youtube become a privilege reserved for the rich?"
"If reddit has taught me anything, it's that if you want to have a three way with some friend or acquaintance NO YOU DON'T "
"2 or 3 months before her wedding, my friend had a coworker tell her he is in love with her. He is a few years older (early 30s) with a couple of kids...and his pregnant wife. He tells my friend he is leaving his wife, hasn't been happy for a long time and is head over heels in love with my friend.

Now, my friend is a knock out and luckily is the whole package: gorgeous and crazy smart. She is also madly in love with her (now) husband. She and the coworker guy never spent time together outside of work. They really didnt even work that closely together, really, and he didn't really know my friend as a person. I think he was using my friend as an excuse to get out of a shitty marriage. It was awful for my friend to go to work with this guy who basically moped around the office all sad because ""the love of his life is marrying someone else."" Ugh, get a grip, asshole."
Ice cream should be an every date thing tbh
"That pharmacy is nothing more than counting pills and making it difficult for you to get your prescriptions while blaming physicians and insurance. 

In reality, pharmacy is a lot more complicated than that. Pharmacists have to know so much to make sure your doctor isn't going to kill you. Also, we're always on the patient side, we want what is best for you, so I promise I'm trying to get that price to be reasonable and make sure I read the doctor scribble correctly. "
I legit cannot understand why so many parents can't apologize to their kids when they fuck up.
My friend dressed up and role played a kitten one time before having sex with her boyfriend. I guess he was into that pussy. 
"Chemical engineers don't work in labs (well, not most of them) just because the word ""chemical"" is in the title.

"Misconception: that scientists wear lab coats all the time. I only put one on when I'm working with something really dirty/dangerous or when I'm cold.

Also that scientists work in isolation. In most cases it takes a whole team of people to make a discovery, but the senior scientist on the paper gets most of the credit and name recognition."
"I liked not having to answer questions.

Want to go outside at 10 PM and look at the moon?  No one is going to ask where you're going because you opened the door.

That kind of thing.  Loved it."

We're all entitled to make terrible choices sometimes.
"If I'm dating him and discover he's a health nut, 90% going to break up with him. I'm an active person who generally has a good diet, but I can't be with a guy who is going to shame me for enjoying a burger and a beer every once in a while. I don't care how great his body is, it's not worth it if we can't enjoy the little things in life. Vegetarians, vegans, and guys with restricted diets might be okay, as long as they don't make me feel guilty for not eating like they do."
"Dry packs of ramen, is this a thing in the US?"
"Broad City reminds me of my friendship with my best friend. They're inappropriate, gross, but 100% there for each other. 

Liz Lemon never having anything go her way as well as being a generally average person reminds me of me. 

Eliza Hamilton in the musical Hamilton is the most kinship I've ever felt to a fictional character in terms of personality. Never grabbing the spotlight, always giving endless second chances, wanting everyone to be kind, etc. 

Helena Bertinelli aka Huntress is some one I relate to when it comes to heritage. Growing up I too struggled with faith (ultimately leaving the church) and came from a large Italian family who did things I still struggle to accept (not Mafia related- more along the lines of domestic abuse, alcoholism, and severe bigotry).

"I don't get that. It's pretty easy to get one now that's pretty cheap and on a pre-paid low cost plan, and you'd especially need some kind of phone if you're trying to get a job. "
"When I was in fourth grade, my family drove down to Florida from New England. It was a hellish trip - little brother got violently ill on the New Jersey Turnpike (at an age when I was violently afraid of throwing up), my older sister was complaining about how she was sure she had ""stomach ulcers"" all the way down (she did not have ulcers), and then when we finally got to Florida, it thunderstormed every. single. day. Not your typical Florida thunderstorm, where it's finished almost as soon as it's started, but all day affairs.

The last day of our trip, it was beautiful outside. We planned to go to Disney World. We were in the car, on the way. My sister was complaining about her ""ulcers"" again, and my brother was asking to go back to the hotel to go in the pool. Finally my father said that if the whining didn't stop, he'd turn the car around and drive us straight home.

Well, wouldn't you know it, even with me screaming ""JUST LET ME GO ALONE, PLEASE, JUST LET ME GO, I WANT TO GO,"" my amazing siblings kept up with their belly aching... And when we got to the gatekeeper, my father said:

""I'm sorry, I have the only three kids in the world who don't want to go to fucking Disney. Can you let me in so I can turn around to take them home?""

And he did just that. 22 straight hours... All the way home.

I've still never been to Disney, and my parents still say they owe me a trip. My brother still apologizes to this day. My sister is still a jerk and a hypochondriac.

TL;DR: Most upsetting moment of my life that I will never forgive my siblings for.

Edit: We also never took a family trip again. HAHA, good call, parents."
I am a software engineer. I cannot be replaced by any random 15 year old boy. I do not know how to hack.
"I have a friend who's been dating this guy for a little over two years and they've **never** had sex. I don't know that they've even fooled around.

It would be one thing if they wanted to be abstinent, but my friend has confided to everyone in our immediate friend group that she's been pleading to have sex, or at least foreplay, with him the entire time they've been dating. Her boyfriend's reasoning for not wanting to be intimate is that he has body issues, but he's actually in pretty great shape and my friend says that they've been working together to build healthier habits (eating better, working out, etc), but to no avail. The whole situation just seems fishy to me especially since the boyfriend seems very uninterested in affection at all. Like shying away from my friend when she tries to kiss him, not returning a hug. It's very odd."
Plot twist: the user who assumed you were a guy with a small dick was also a woman who you assumed to be a man.
"My son is almost 4 and has already made me change my views about my brothers, father, SO and basically all men. Because you can see boys start out the same as girls. whether it comes to loving a flower or a doll next to trains and automobiles, or when it comes to feeling fear and insecurity next to being tough and rough housing. he is a human, he has feelings, he has likes and dislikes that are personal and his own. 

When I buy him stuff and HAVE to choose between a girl- or boy-version -like the other day when buying a toothbrush and there was a black starwars brush and a hello kitty brush- I always let him choose. Luckily I am surrounded by people who also couldn't care less he now has a pink toothbrush with hearts and a white cat on it."
She's all buddy buddy with someone one minute and then talking shit about them to somebody else in the next. There's a difference between venting out your frustrations with your friends and straight up talking shit.
"Women don't get asked out as often as men seem to think.

 I'm an okay looking woman, I get stared at constantly by guys/cat-called/touched without permission a few times a day. But as for a man approaching me politely or respectfully to ask me out to coffee or for my number, even in appropriate setting like a bar or something? Less than five times in my life. Yet every guy who knows me seems to think I'm being run down by men constantly begging me for dates. Weird men being inappropriately aggressive? Constantly. Being asked out? Almost Never. "
The way women on here tend to be so vehemently childfree is so different from the women I know in real life. There is no way 90% of women would never ever ever want kids but that's how AW responds.
"I stay away from men that have served in the military.   I'm not sure why but I just can't seem to get along with them in the romantic sense.  There's an aspect to their personality that clashes with mine.   Like a deeply serious side or something.   

I can be friends with military people but I guess it ends there."
That took a happier turn than I expected it to. That makes me happy. 
"Well, there's also culture and region to deal with. A lot of places it's considered inappropriate for women to do the chasing. So it'll put guys off. A lot of places it's considered the norm for the chasing to be split 50/50, so it's as successful as when men do it. But where I live, it's both not the norm, and not taboo. So most men find it refreshing and flattering, and will say yes even when they wouldn't have pursued me themselves. 

And yeah, being harsh isn't really good for either gender. "
"I would not like my dog sharing what percent of my getting ready time is spent being distracted by my phone or something on my dresser or in general how much I dilly dally.  I think a few people have a good guess, but my dog sits with me when I get ready. SHE KNOWS. "
"Deep purple or dark brown lipstick. Ladies, we're all 90s R&amp;B stars now, and I love it."
"I have really petty dealbreakers. Like, you could be an addict in recovery and I'll cope with it. But if I have to tell you more than twice not to clip your toenails in the living room, not to piss on the toilet seat, or if you don't pick up your towels after yourself, or you don't take out the trash when you say you will, I will 100% break up with you. I can't stand small laziness and when people still do the annoying shit they do even after they promise won't. Other people think is just price of admission and that you deal with that kind of small life crap because people aren't perfect, but I'd rather deal with something major, tbh. "
"My size. I'm 5""10 and I don't know how heavy but I'm big. Apparently the Amazon thing does it for a looooooot of people."
I have a very attractive friend who seems to have much less success than you... but my guess is that she comes on too harsh. Her love of banter often crosses over to outright rude. I imagine asking nicely or neutrally is the key here.
"It feels like a lot of people on this sub are fine with NSA sex. I'm sexual, but I'm not a personality that can have sex without the emotional aspect. ""It's just sex"" isn't a sentiment I can relate to."

"not exactly normal, but seemed necessary and became part of the status quo... I grew up in Palo alto (before and while it was becoming silicon valley... My family had no money and bought a crappy apartment in the 80s) and when I was just out of high school there began a string of middle and high school kids killing themselves by throwing themselves in front of the train that passed by the local high school. For a while, a bunch of people say in chairs by several train crossings at night to try and catch anyone thinking about ending it. I worked til almost midnight and would talk to some of them on my bike ride home from work. They were really nice, so sometimes I'd bring them food or drinks.I just saw an article a colleague from school posted on Facebook - aparently suicide is still a major issue over there. From what I saw, a lot of kids had too much money, not enough quality time with parents. Lots of mixing antidepressants with drugs and alochol, too."

This. The episode where she's watching those nightly exposÃ©s and covering the couch with plastic because couches are toxic or whatever really got to me.

My friend from middle school was staying at my house for the night. She snuck in her boyfriend and they had sex on my beloved baby blanket that my grandma made for me. I wanted to give it to my children but now it's tainted in my eyes. I know it sounds silly but it still irks me 12 years later.

"It was normal for kids to have new fancy cars to me. Hummer, Porsche, Mercedes, Audi, Land Rover. Those are the cars my best friends had back then .. Even though I was rocking Agnes (my 5 year old Impala at the time) I thought it was normal. It was easy to tell the teachers parking lot from the students.."

"My entire wardrobe would consist of large soft T shirts with abstract prints, cargo pants, sports bras or full-coverage bras, and workout shoes.  I would buzz-cut my hair off so I didn't have to worry about it.  I would throw out all my purses and just use the cargo pants.  I would stop trying to do my eyebrows, which I hate doing.  It would be glorious."
Well that would make a boring movie.

"Anything about sexual attraction. I can see how some people are visually appealing, but I'll never understand how that translates to wanting to have sex with them. Whenever I see threads talking about how sexy forearms or butts are I'm always a little confused."
"The new Ghostbusters is the first time I truly understood what representation feels like. I got to see a summer blockbuster with 4 complete women who were awesome, smart, funny, unsure, overcame adversity, worked together, ate, weren't sexualized, and didn't involve a man. They felt authentic in a way my friends do. It was a truly wonderful moment that I wasn't entirely prepared for. I spent most of the second half of the movie silently weeping. It was like not realizing how bad the pain was until it stopped. 

I've been able to identify with plenty of characters before (and I've spent my whole life learning how to identify with men) but this was a first for me. I honestly didn't know I could feel like that. "
"Not as bad, but in Cali they told us sex was a contract and we'd get into legal trouble for having sex bc we were under 18. They weren't too happy when I pointed out it's extremely difficult to back out of a legal contract, but if one party backs out of sex and the other party(ies) continue, then it's rape. Also there's no paperwork with sex, so that ""contract"" stuff wouldn't hold up in a court of law"
"Have a plunger and toilet paper, and a shower curtain and towel in an easily accessible place so you don't have to unpack everything before using the bathroom.

"Daria was so damn accurate. I mean Mike Judge is clearly a genius anyway he really nails those characters, but Daria in particular. I can still point out the Daria girls whenever go past a highschool or whatever. I think he just understood what it must be like to grow up as a female misfit. "
"I just moved back home with my mom and I feel like I'm stuck in this awful period of my life. I'm 25 and finished 7 years of post secondary education and it all feels like a waste of time. 95% of the resumes I send out get no response, and the other 5% get no further than an interview. 
My mom is a great and loving woman but cannot stop nit picking at my life.
I've basically been reducing to being a teenager again after 7 years on my own. I have no car, no money and no independence.
My anxiety and depression which has always been a part of my life is now becoming unbearable. I feel like I'm drowning and not a single person notices. "
"I think a lot of people could see themselves in the characters from Freaks &amp; Geeks. Lindsay was such a realistic character to me...

That show just really represented high school well, imo. "

I don't even think there really was a majority, culturally or racially. I thought having an extremely diverse group of friends was completely normal, and who gives a shit if someone's black or indian or asian? Have they beaten Kingdom Hearts to 100% completion? Can they recite a Foamy the Squirrel rant? What about the Llama song? Those are the questions that mattered. 

Also, we had the best potlucks ever. Seriously. "
"Being able to be openly physically affectionate with my girl friends without any implications on our sexual orientation. With my best friends, we hold hands, walk arm in arm, fix each others hair, caress each others backs and arms, hug, look deeply into each other's faces, have snuggly slumber parties, hold each other while crying, occasionally kiss on the cheek, without any assumed implications that these actions are anything other than endearing warmth, affection, and friendship. I think men are rather limited in their ability to give and receive affection in friendship and that it actually puts a lot of undue pressure on their expectations of sex and romance as a result."

"I asked my step dad to come to my high school graduation and he said no and instead went to help set up for his friend's daughters graduation party. So he missed my graduation AND lunch afterwards for his friends daughters graduation. I've been out of high school 11 years, I'm still annoyed.

And my grandparents planned a dinner at a nice restaurant for my mom and aunts and uncles. My mom told me I couldn't go because it was just for them and none of the grandkids were going. My uncle asked me the next day why I wasn't there. All of my cousins and siblings went, but I was told I couldn't go. I still have no clue why I wasn't invited but I was angry.. and clearly still bitter about it. "
"God, I fucking hate the people who think that if you're poor, or even if you're getting government assistance, it should be *just enough to meet your basic needs* and how dare you find any enjoyment whatsoever.

I see people get so outraged over the idea of people on food stamps buying things like steak. So? It's not like they're getting more or less assistance based on what they buy with their food stamps. If that's what they choose to do, so be it. We're supposed to be helping, not controlling people."

I find myself fascinated by how he interacts with the world around him. He is a very active child who learns by doing.

Not an angel either.  She has a lot of baggage coming with her, but so do most politicians who have been in the game as long as she has.  Her baggage has been overblown to try to dirty her name as much as possible and that is frustrating.

She is alright and I think she could be a pretty good president.  She is strong (as you need to be for being a woman in politics) and has incredibly thick skin, unlike the republican nominee.  She isn't my ideal candidate, but I will be voting for her in the fall."

"My 8th grade science teacher made us keep these precise organized binders for her class, and that just was not my thing. I was always getting bad grades on them, so she called my parents and insisted I should come in after school once a week for the next *three months* in order to fix this with her.

My first day of afterschool with her, I gave her a list of worksheets I had lost from my binder, and she gave me new copies of all of the sheets on my list... except two.

The next week, as I organized my new stuff for her, I reminded her that I still needed copies of those two things.

The next week, I reminded her again.

This continued for the full three months. Every week I'd ask her for those two items, and every week she'd wave me off to do something else. 

After my last afterschool day with her, she sent home a note to my parents saying, ""I'm sorry to inform you that segmentedcat *is still missing some items from her binder*.""

To this day I am 100% convinced that she deliberately withheld those two sheets from me for months just so she'd be able to claim in the end that I was still a wreck and a failure."
That they're a lot more confused and threatened by women than I ever imagined. And more emotionally vulnerable than I knew. They find a wider range of female body types attractive than mass media has always led me to believe. 
"You completely misunderstood. I know a good deal on current birth control methods. I however am also aware that they and their interactions vary from person to person. The two most informed people to be making the decisions and giving the advise would be my daughter and her doctor.

This is not a case of ""icky, go do girl things with girl doctor"" it is ""I'm not the most educated in the room, I defer to the Dr""

I can read up on the various interactions birth control may have but I will never experience cramps or menstruation or the hormonal imbalances that may occur. I'm not physically capable of knowing.

I'm empathetic enough, but I have no experience in that ballgame."

"Hey, I'm another nineteen-year-old. I mostly use Tinder. Depending on how good-looking you are, you'll either get a flood of messages and a lot of guys messaging you first, whereupon you can decide to reply based on how interesting/attractive they are, or, like me, you won't get matches so much and you'll need to initiate. If possible, message something about one of their pictures or their bio. If they have generic pictures and no/limited bio, I usually just go with ""Hey, how's it going?"" or whatever. They'll still reply.

If I've swiped right and we keep up a decent conversation for twenty or thirty minutes, I tell them I'm looking for casual sex and ask if they'd like to meet up. They always do. Then you arrange that.

My biggest piece of advice is not to message back and forth forever. It doesn't really give you an idea of in-person chemistry, and having that same conversation face-to-face will tell you a lot more about the person.

Oh, and always meet in public first. Safety first, yo. 

I use Tinder a lot, so feel free to let me know if you have any more questions."

"The thing that bothered me the most was how she just nonchalantly went on about her day after finding the $100. She never apologized. When I told her she owed us an apology, she scoffed at me and told me my brother and I should have told her the truth. The lesson I learned that day? Always say sorry when you're in the wrong. 

*Can you tell I'm still bitter about this? Because I am. lol*"
I mean. Yeah who doesn't?
"I wish men would stop thinking that just because one woman does this one thing...that this automatically means we *all* do it. That goes for all the questions that come in being like ""I SEE ALL THESE WOMEN WEARING PINK. WHY DO YOU LOVE PINK?"" type questions.

"&gt;I may be wrong, but I feel that Boys don't need school as much as girls for academic reasons . 

Yes, you are wrong. Girls are conditioned to be socially aware. It isn't natural and it isn't fun or pleasant, it's just an expectation, whereas boys have the freedom to learn as they go.

"That I am psychic. Apparently it's just expected of me to know where a letter goes when there's no name or mailbox number on it. I should also be able to tell where any package is at any time, regardless of whether it has a tracking number on it or not.

But you know how much time they actually spend licking their butthole. Mutually assured destruction. 
I can't decide whether that sounds fun or absolutely horrifying. 
Two things. The amount of time I spend with my hands down my pants cupping my imaginary balls when no one is home. And how I promptly lick off  whatever food that falls on my stomach or boobies while eating on the couch. I'm pretty lady-like in public so I'd like to not change that image.

"&gt;Thankfully, a lot of the sexism I read about here seems to be US-specific.

Yeah. Once read a thread about a dad that had two daughters and were like ""Omg! I don't know how women work! How do I raise my kids?"" and my inital reaction was ""Uhm... Really? That's sexist!"" and soooo many women answered with ""No, you're fine, my dad was great!"" or ""I loved playing sports with my dad when I was a young girl!"" like it was normal for him to think that women are a different species and needs to be raised as something other than respectful human beings. That isn't really the normal view on men and women in Scandinavia..."
"I'm telling you, if I as a guy didn't have some very close female friends with who I can talk about feelings and complicated relationship or family matters, I would have gone insane by now. I can't imagine how hard it would be without people like that in my life.

I used to help out at a women's shelter and one of the most coveted donations was nice bath/body products. People tend to donate shitty hard soap/shampoo from dollar stores but occasionally we would receive donations from Bath &amp; Body Works or other nicer brands. It meant a lot to those women to be able to smell nice or have soft skin.

"I've definitely enjoyed some ""trashy"" romance novels in my day, and I agree with /u/bibabeep that it mostly depends on the publisher, cover, plot tropes, and literary value. To me, a typical ""trashy"" romance is published by Harlequin, features a [Fabio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabio_Lanzoni) clone on the cover, and contains a formulaic plot with lots and lots and LOTS of sex and little social commentary or insight. That's what separates Jane Eyre or Sense &amp; Sensibility from [The Highlander's Runaway Bride](http://www.harlequin.com/storeitem.html?iid=63419&amp;cid=191).

ETA: That said, these things exist on a spectrum. The [Outlander series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlander_series), for example, *does* have lots and lots of sex, but it also explores the lives and roles of women in the 18th century and features a decent amount of history and political intrigue. (Fun fact: when I worked in a bookstore, Outlander was actually shelved with the regular fiction instead of with romance.)"
" boss thinks it's absurd that I buy myself flowers once a month(ish). It cost me about 20$, the bouquet lasts at least a week, sometimes 2, and they make me happy in my dull bedroom with no art while I eat my chicken thighs with rice and greenbeans (again). I don't usually see my house by the light of day. I don't get too enjoy flowers unless I buy them.  

Edit: the July [bouquet](http://m.imgur.com/6nVr9B1) yes. It was $20 dollars. I got it in the afternoon on the last day of the week (he's not open weekends) and he gives me a deal because I bring him sweets when I bake."

So they get super excited when they get to come to my house, cause it's Barbie paradise! I was a Barbie fanatic as a child, and my mom a pack rat, so I have quite the collection, and my house is a judgement free zone :)"

"I'd dye my hair crazy colors. I'd either cut it very short or wear it in a ponytail 99.9% of the time.

I'd wear leggings, yoga pants, and stretchy soft clothes exclusively.

I'd wear Crocs in public. Colorful ones.

I'd get a tattoo on my wrist.

I'd consider a nose piercing. (Just a bit of sparkle for my face.)

I might never wear makeup again.

Basically, I'd be more comfortable and much more colorful."
"Probably my sense of humor.  I always felt like it made guys view me as a ""bro"" and I got the impression that they wanted someone to laugh at THEIR jokes rather than be the one to make them.  But I found someone who thinks my sense of humor is attractive and it's nice to joke around now without feeling like I'm doing something wrong."
"In my mind, everything is something to be embarrassed about. Definitely something I'm working on.
Like, I casually saw a guy a few months ago and had never done oral before. The first time he asks, I am miraculously chill about the whole thing. The second time (a few weeks later), I spend a solid few minutes under the sheets laughing anxiously at his dick, too embarrassed to start. I freeze up when I make accidental eye contact with strangers, when baristas ask for my order, and when I am in any sexual situation. Personality."
"If she's ~*NOT LIKE OTHER GURLS*~

By which I mean if someone is loud and proud about how they're not like other girls, with the implication being that other girls are inferior and only concerned with stupid, girly things like makeup and and relationships and gossip. Like, I am also not into makeup and many aspects of traditional femininity, but there's nothing wrong with it if someone is. The attitude seems very immature, and I particularly associate it with my own immaturity, because I was ~*NOT LIKE OTHER GURLS*~ when I was about 7 years old. Then I grew up a bit and realised that hey, some girls are awesome, and some girls are shitty, and the same goes for boys."
"I could go on about this all day. They have been together for *years*, met in high school. Got engaged in 2012 while they were both living with her grandma. I am almost positive he sold her original engagement ring when she moved out of state for a few months to live with her mom. He had some sort of drug problem going on for a few months with xanex? Then he cheated on her. Then she decided to have her wedding 2 months after mine even though she had been engaged since 2012. Also, there is so much more than this.

Long story short, they have been through ""everything"" together and ""overcame"" it (in her words). The wedding was bad, not rehearsed at all. They have a crap ton of debt for never going to college and only being 24. They live in a tiny ass town. They have no one else so why not just marry each other? "

"I don't think I'll be able to change your thinking on this (or hers), but neither of those thoughts are really a thing...

- Playing with dolls isn't in any way a precursor (or an indicator) to someone discovering they identify with part of the  LGBT+ community. It's not socioeconomic experiences that 'make' a person LGBT+ - if it were, there would be overwhelming evidence that conversion therapy worked. 

- There is (in an MM or FF relationship) no 'man' and no 'woman' role. That's kind of the point. There are tops and bottoms when it comes to sex, but a large portion/majority of people are versatile anyway. And in everything else, it's just gender roles that persevere after hundreds of years. Who says it's the 'woman' who cooks/cleans/raises the children? Who says it's the 'man' who mows the lawn, builds furniture, plays sports with their kids, who initiates sex?

I'm trying not to say anything that either of you find offensive - I know this must have been a bit of a shock to you both. If there's anything else you'd like to talk about, let me know."
"Okay, stay with me because this confused me at first.

After my ex husband and I split (him-18, me-21) he got with a 15 year old. They got married when she turned 18 and yay bliss for a couple years.

out of the blue she leaves him. first she hooks up with a girl (who happens to be my best friend since basically conception, still not okay with that). they split and she gets with this 40 year old trucker. runs the fuck away with him for a few months. meanwhile, there has been no legal proceedings so they are still legally married. doesn't stop hubby from getting a girlfriend, possibly legal age but not sure.

THEN wife comes back to town, her and husband get back together, and the two now single people (40 yr old trucker &amp; young girl) get together. husband and wife are soooo happy then BAM!

wife leaves him again. just a couple days ago. best friend let me know when it happened. 

best fucking shit ever."

"I read that one and it's the mom introduced her to the guy without mentioning that they already slept together before.

daughter started dating the guy and ended up marrying him.

then daughter found the mom's naked photos in an old thumb drive somewhere in the closest, thought that they're having an affair and only found out that they had a thing before after confronting husband.

daughter felt she should have been told by one or both of them at least before the whole relationship and at least before the marriage. she felt betrayed by both."
"/r/MakeUpAddiction. I used to really love that sub but I barely enjoy going on it now. Some people get so angry and defensive there. They complain about too much repetitiveness and they never actually bring anything innovative to the table anyway. You get down voted to oblivion if you say anything negative about one of their beloved makeup products. It's just makeup for Christ sake, put down the pitchfork. When someone asks for CC, there's always that one person who takes it a step too far with their critiques. I think a lot of people on MUA just like to start shit and get into arguments for fun, so there isn't really anything you can do. "
"If it was a friend who knew I was straight, I'd think it odd that she asked me out. If she just said that she was developing feelings for me and thought I should know because she wanted to pull back from the friendship or something, then I'd appreciate her letting me know and would be careful in future interactions. 

If it was a friend who didn't know I was straight, I would politely turn her down, tell her I was straight and we'd move forward based on how she reacted to that. "

"A few days ago one of my SO's (now former) Facebook friends posted a rant about BLM and how Michelle Obama is ghetto trash.  In my head, I knew I should find it offensive, but it was just so baffling that I couldn't... like, the woman is a graduate of Princeton and Harvard fucking Law School and earns 6 figures with a resume long enough to wallpaper that guy's entire trailer.  And she's the First Lady of the United fucking States.  She's literally everything that ""ghetto trash"" isn't.  It was completely ridiculous.  

I'm used to racists being stupid, and normally a rant like that would have been just more white (supremacist) noise, but for some reason I just can't get it out of my head.  Maybe because it came from a guy that I know considers himself to be a progressive.  His wife is a very vocal feminist, they both volunteer, environmentalists, raising their kids to be vegetarians... but apparently he's been bottling up his seething hatred for black people for years, and it all came pouring out in that one really nasty post.  And every word of it was so stupid.  

I don't know.  It wasn't even shocking so much as just... really confusing.  "
