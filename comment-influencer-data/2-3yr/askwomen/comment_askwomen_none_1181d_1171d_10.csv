If he's refusing to dance because he genuinely doesn't like dancing that's neither a turn on or off. If he's refusing to dance because he thinks dancing is stupid or he's that afraid to lose his dignity in the name of fun, that's a turn off. "

My boobs and hips got a little more filled out but mostly I just got fatter lol.
"The one I just had this past Tuesday.

Started talking to a guy who lives a few hours away on OKC a few weeks ago. We were basically texting non-stop every day with so much to say. We decided to call one another and could talk for hours that way. Then we decided we should probably meet. So we picked a city halfway between both of ours this past Tuesday. Neither of us had ever been to said city, so we researched and found a cool gastropub and a lighthouse on the lake. Cool - stuff to do.

Got there at almost the same time. Hugged in the parking lot. Chatted a little before wandering in. Sat down in a cozy lil' booth. Got drinks and dinner. Talked talked talked. The conversation flow was so easy. After about an hour or so we decided to venture to the lake. We each got in our cars, I followed him. As we drive into this park my jaw drops. There were lagoons, footbridges everywhere, a carousel, a little train, tire swings, gazebos, fountains, pavilions, a gorgeous grass and tree-covered pier, a deer sanctuary, the lighthouse. He parked, and I did behind him and we both got out of our cars and were like ""What magical fairly land IS THIS!?""

We walked around the park for hours. Just talking. Being silly. Learning so much about one another. Watching the sunset from the top of the lighthouse, wandering more. We eventually decided to take a seat next to this fountain and we probably sat there and talked for almost two hours. Sun set, it got dark, the lights came on, and there we were - alone in this park just chatting the night away. By the end of our conversation and realizing how late it was, he had his arm around me and I was cozied up against him. We kept catching looks at one another out of the corners of our eyes and smiling like morons.

Then it started to sprinkle. So we got up, walked back to our cars. We kept talking as it started to rain harder trying to prolong this date as long as we could, but it had to end at some point. I went in to give him a hug, and he hugged back. Hard. And we held each other there for a little bit. Then we both pulled away, but were still holding one another and looked each other dead in the eyes. He told me I was pretty amazing, and he hoped I had as great of a night as he did. I blushed, said of course I did because goddamn this night was awesome. Then he pulls the ultimate romance move and cups my cheek in his hand and kisses me, in the fucking rain. 

I wanted to swoon right then and there but held it together. Luckily. So not only was it the most romantic date in general, but it was only our first date. I'm traveling to his city and seeing him on Saturday. :)"
"I'm 71 and I am rather surprised that I've made it this far.  Why I don't know, but I am.  I have never been sensitive about my age, gray hair, or my obviously old body, wrinkles, etc.  It was made plain to me that aging was inevitable and natural and to be proud of each stage of my life.  I wish everyone could be like this and I think that people would be happier.  I feel sorry for people who run run run after staying young it takes so much energy and keeps you focused on yourself instead of what is really important, other things and people in life."
"I love my kids very much but raising children is a all encompassing venture. You will lose yourself, at least for a while, it will take a toll on your marriage on some level, it's a huge commitment.  The only reason to plan for children is because you want children.   There have been many days I wished that I had taken another path, but that's magical thinking. 

  Do not have children unless you really, really want children.  And don't feel guilty about not wanting children.  It doesn't make you a bad, selfish, or lesser person."

When I first started dating my current SO we were in bed and my feet were cold and without thinking I put them on his legs. I realized what I was doing and pulled them away and apologized for putting my cold feet on him. He looked so confused, pulled me closer and smothered my feet with his legs, warming them right up. He told me he wants to keep me warm and that I could put my cold feet on him any time I wanted. I couldn't stop kissing him after that. I still feel overwhelmed with love whenever I think about it. üôÇ

And to prove his sincerity he is always asking if my feet are cold or just wrapping them up in his own feet or legs or whatever just to make sure they are not cold. My feet have never been so warm! ‚ù§Ô∏è"

"I met my ex online and we talked and fell in love over the course of a year. He made plans to come visit me for my birthday! I remember always thinking he had really ""pretty"" features and he told me he had a hormone deficiency which made him unable to grow facial hair. Well, when I saw him at the airport I remember saying, ""wow! You're so short!""
 Fast forward a week, nothing sexual happens which is cool because we really had just met each other. 
He leaves, it's sad. 
When he gets home, I get a call from his sister and she is upset. Telling me that he needs to tell me something. He finally gets on the phone, distraught and says he's transgender. Now, this was 12 years ago and trans wasn't a big thing so I really didn't know what that meant. He explained to me that he was born a woman but was transitioning to become a man and I realized so many small things I had noticed finally made sense. I still loved him regardless and we stayed together.
We visited each other every few months as much as we could but broke up after 2 years because he ended up cheating on me and falling in love with someone else.


He should have told me from the beginning. I should have had the opportunity to know what I was dealing with. I was a straight girl who fell in love and eventually had sex with someone who had a vagina. That break up fucked me up and made me question every ounce of who I was. I needed counseling. 

I am 100% for equal rights and gay marriage and trans rights and all of that but please, tell the truth. Be honest. If the person is the right person, something like that won't matter but they should know before it gets too serious. 


TL;DR:My ex was trans, I didn't find out for over a year, stayed together because I was already in love. Had a very bad break up that messed me up for a long time."

"My friend(F) and I(M) had a threesome with Jared Leto like 5 years ago during the Into the Wild Tour. It was a bit weird because she and i had only been friends for like 3 months when this happened and her exbf gave her the tickets before they went on a break.

Edit: Here is the story just incase the comments can't don't appear
  
---

My friend and her bf went on a break 2 weeks before the concert. They had gotten meet and greet tickets and she was now tasked to sell it. Knowing how much of a 30STM fan i was she offered me the ticket at a discount. The bad part was the the show was at the other end of our state and we would have to travel together. At this point we had only known each other for about 3 months. She and i met at the gym when she asked if i knew one of her friends and we just hit it off from there. 

We decide to go for it and just drive to LA for the show. We ended up getting a hotel and go to the show. It was fucken awesome. During the meet and greet she ended up talking to Shannon(Jared‚Äôs brother) about her situation. Jared joined in and started talking to us. My friend is very attractive and i could already see it in Jared‚Äôs eyes that he wanted to fuck her. They continued with the meet and greet while we were still there. After a bit a lady came up to us and asked if she could talk to us privately. She told us that we were invited to an after party they were having since they could finally take a couple of days off from touring before going to their next city. We were fucken ecstatic about this. I told her that i was 100% sure that Jared was going to try to fuck her and she was way too excited about that.

So we end up going to a party with 30STM and a couple of other celebrities. There was like 25 people at this party and it was relatively chill. Its as a lot more calm that what i expected, but it was fun. Jared approached my friend and they started talking. I have to say that Jared was also being extremely polite with including me in the conversations even though he was only trying to talk to her. A couple hours later everything was dying down and he came back to us and asked where we were staying. He then told us we could stay here if we wanted. I have no idea if that was his house of if they were staying there for the time being but we stayed there. There was a lot of rooms and a guest house, but my friend and i stayed in a room together. After a bit Jared just came into the room to talk to her and i was like ‚ÄúSo i guess he is going to fuck her‚Äù then Jared just walked in and tapped my shoulder and asked something like ‚Äúso who is going first‚Äù and that is when i realized that we were going to double team my friend. I asked her if she was cool with this and she was pretty much down for what ever as long as Jared got to fuck her. 

I almost left the room when i saw this man‚Äôs dick. I am average size girth and a bit longer length, but his dick was pretty big. The fucken look she got on her face when she saw it literally made my heart sink into my stomach. I had never been insecure, but i was a bit taken back. It all went away after we started having sex and i realize that having a giant dick means that you are destined to a life of mediocre BJs and never going balls deep while pounding. I hate how much i am talking about his dick, but it was crazy seeing it all go down. As skuzzy as Jared looks, he was very adamant about condoms and safe sex.

Once we finish and Jared leaves it is just her and i just laying naked in bed processing everything that happened. The next day we say good bye and go back to the hotel to have sex one more time before driving back home. We never tried to get in contact with Jared again.

Now every time 30STM comes to a city near us we send links to it as a joke. She got back with her bf and they are now married so we aren‚Äôt going to go to any concerts together in any time soon.

"So, I'm 35 and not a bio. mom, but I had foster kids and plan to again. IMO, it was the best of both worlds for a slew of reasons. 

I got surgically sterilized when I was 22 and have never wanted bio. kids. Not when I turned 30, not when I ""met the right guy,"" not when I was married - or any other milestone that I was ensured would be the catalyst for suddenly wanting babies.. I don't want to give birth in the same way I don't want a waterbed: I. Just. Don't. I've never regretted it or wavered or had a tinge of regret or baby fever or anything else. 

I am, however, maternal and nurturing, oddly. I'm also adopted and have insight into the foster/ adoption process and the issues that may arise. For that reason, and my desire to better the world in a small way, I fostered 3 different kids and still keep in touch with all of them, and 1 of their parents. I plan to do so again. This is my version of ""calling"" into parenthood and I've done much, much better going this route than I *ever* would have having bio. kids. Not sure what else to include, so feel free to AMA"

"It'd probably make socializing at work easier. Everyone on my team has kids under 10. I have absolutely zero interest in kids that I'm not related to, but because I'm a woman I'm expected to coo over pictures of toddlers and listen to stories about little Johnny using the potty, etc. It's exhausting.

"Abortion should be available (and easily accessible) at any time, for any reason, to anyone who seeks it (provided the person is legally able to consent, of course). On demand, without apology. It's an autonomy issue. It's a human rights issue.

It should be noted that in countries where that's the standard, there are fewer abortions. 

Personally I don't know that that's my most ""out there"" position, but I think it might be my most controversial.

Edit: I have clearly articulated my views, and will not be engaging with any anti-choice people on the matter. **Bring your bait elsewhere; I won't be taking it.**"

"I don't intentionally keep it a secret, but I also don't do a lot of certain grooming activities in front of my husband. 

He has no clue about plucking -- how much I do it, where I do it, what happens when I don't do it. He was *stunned* to walk in once and surprise me as I was plucking a tiny hair that sometimes grows just under one nostril. It's not a big dark nose hair, just a little thicker and darker than the surrounding vellus hair that I have just like other mammals, but it still needs to die. 

He just paused for a second and then recovered admirably with, ""That looks like it hurt."" 

When I pluck a few stray brow hairs off him, he acts as though I'm applying hot needles. Maybe I'm just desensitized to it, or maybe my thinner skin lets go of stray hairs more easily, but I secretly take pleasure in the fact that I'm tough enough to tweeze without flinching."

"My husband and I abstained from sex until we were married.  We were motivated by our shared religious beliefs and the feeling that any chance of getting pregnant while unmarried was too high.

There was certainly lots of chemistry when we were dating. We spent a lot of time dancing, taking long walks, and cooking. Sex was very tempting at times, but we were very motivated to wait.

We've been married a little over a year now. I'm happy we got to learn how to have sex together. We had a great time in the first months of marriage, even when our attempts were clumsy and awkward. I appreciate that we have had so much practice showing that we love each other in ways that weren't sex, such an important ingredient to a good sex life. I also really love that sex reflects our marriage vows - it's exclusive, faithful, and open to children. 

My advice for other people who are waiting until they are married to have sex:

* Make sure that you and your future spouse aren't motivated to abstain by disinterest, shame, or previous bad experiences. 

* Understand that libido and sexual interests change through out life. Having perfectly matched libidos the first year is no guarantee that they will stay the same for life. If you believe that marriage is life-long, then you have to be prepared to be married even when you aren't ""compatible"" sexually.

* Discuss any sex acts you think are immoral or would never be willing to try before marrying."
"I had just taken a risk and chopped the majority of my hair off. It was more short than I had ever cut it. I was so nervous I wouldnt be able to pull it off.

My boyfriend had been complimenting me on it all day, which was very sweet, but that night, when things were getting firey, he paused, looked at me, and said ""you are so fucking beautiful"".

I was just...taken aback. Nobody has ever said anything about me *like that*. The sincerity and intensity of his words...Ill never forget it.

That was a fun night."
"There was a posting a few months back where OP was confused as to why her mother seemed to want to wear a white dress to OP's wedding. In this thread, people kept advising OP to cut her toxic, controlling, narcissistic mother out of her life, to seek solace in /r/raisedbynarcissists, and keep Mom away from the wedding. It turns out that OP's mom had been shopping online while the program f.lux ran on her desktop. F.lux is a filter you can put on your computer to ease eye strain and make you sleepy when you're on your computer at night. It makes everything on your desktop look pinkish or sepia-toned late at night. So when OP discovers this, her mom was horrified to realize that the mother-of-the-bride dresses she thought were a lovely bright pink were actually stark white. The two had a good laugh over it. 

That was the biggest escalation I'd ever seen on /r/relationships!

"I remember one on /r/relationships a while ago where a man's girlfriend didn't want to wear a dress to his brother's wedding even though the invitation suggested a more formal dress code. People told him that he should dump his girlfriend because she was unable to grow up and understand that sometimes you have to dress appropriately for an occasion. Also, people called him a bad boyfriend for trying to control how his girlfriend dressed.

An update a few days later gave way more information. First, the guy called his future sister-in-law who couldn't have cared less about what a guest wore to her wedding. Second, the outfit his girlfriend was planning to wear wasn't just ""pants and a blouse"" as the OP suggested. It was a pair of [palazzo pants](https://www.google.com/search?q=palazzo+pants&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=973&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwqYDctLzNAhVFcj4KHW6LCn0Q_AUIBygC) and an embellished top.

As international school kids, a lot of us really wanted to study in English. I felt so welcome and fortunate that I could come here, and was treated like a UK citizen with no red tape. 

I honestly didn't think it would happen. Watched the first results come in, thought ""shit it's close"", but Remain was in the lead. *Everyone* I know and asked was voting in. My Facebook was flooded with it for weeks. Of course I live in London and all my friends are young liberals. But I woke up to bunch of super depressing texts. 

Looking at the result map where pretty much the entire rest of England and Wales voted Leave makes me feel sick. I have always felt so welcome here. I know the racists would say ""it's not you, it's them"", but fuck that, I'm no different or more hard working than the Polish plumber or Greek nurse. 

Now I don't know what's going to happen to where I call home, or the EU where I grew up. Will I be able to stay? What if I left and wanted to return? I always saw myself moving back to the UK later in life, but I think its borders will be closed to me now. "

In college there was a massive pond near by with all sorts of waterfowl and I used to joke around with my foreign housemate about how delicious they looked, which horrified my poor housemate.

Now our flat was on the ground floor and one day, having left the window wide open, I walked into the kitchen to find a very confused and unhappy duck. I'm pretty used to handling animals but this duck gave me a bit of a runaround. I finally managed to get the duck in a safe handling position so it couldn't flap when my housemate walked in.

"Put simply, I got hotter haha. I never really stopped to think about what I was eating until the last year of high school. Then I lost maybe 10-15 pounds of baby fat mostly by just reducing portions and eating less processed foods as snacks.

I was happy with my body during college--just eating healthy, doing yoga stretches I learned off Wii Fit, and walking around campus gave me a curvy slenderness. Then in my mid-20s, I started exercising regularly (cardio and some very light strength training). I started exercising not so much for the physical benefits (though I love that!), but for how it's helped me manage stress (thanks, grad school!) and given me something fun to do when I'm not working or enjoying one of my hobbies.

"I was home alone one night because my grandmother had taken my grandfather to the ER for angina before I'd gotten home from class.  I didn't want to be alone, though, so I called my best friend, who happened to be a gay guy who was just starting his career as a drag queen whilst being closeted around home because we live in a rather (very) bigoted rural area.

Now, slight backstory:  I had been engaged (not to my gay guy best friend) and we had started planning the wedding, but then he got cold feet and I told him not to let the door hit him on the way out.  This left me with a wedding dress.

You can probably see where this is going.

My best friend came over, we talked, he decided he wanted to try on my wedding dress, and I figured, hell, why not, we're actually close to the same size and maybe he could get some use out of it.  So he took off his shirt and we got down to zipping him into my wedding dress.

We were in the back bedroom, so we didn't hear a thing until I hear my grandmother's voice behind me saying, ""Look at this!  You need to come in here and show Grandpa!""

I yelped, ""Granny!"", closed the bedroom door on her, and while she's saying we need to go show my grandfather, I'm hissing at my friend to get out of the dress, because the last thing my grandfather with chest pains needs to see is a fat man in a wedding dress.

We managed to smooth it over by saying it was a dare.  I'm still not sure how they believed that."

Its hard to admit to myself that while I was in highschool I was basically that girl who could cry to her daddy to get expensive concert tickets and stupid shit like that.

I knew if I made enough of a ruckus I would always get my way. And this didnt happen all the time, I guess I could say generally I was a good kid, never got into too much trouble, but it did happen. I didnt realize how much of a brat I was sometimes back then, but I see it now.

I wish that I had been told no, or that someone would have at least called me on my shit from time to time.

My parents wouldnt do it because they abused each other, and knew we saw it. It was a guilt thing. Or sometimes they were just too tired to bother with discipline. Dad was too drunk. I just knew he had the money.

Whether I could have mustered the mental understanding at that age on my own to realize how far I would take it sometimes....I honestly have no idea.

I just am really glad I am coming out of my old ways. I swear all of us living like that brought out the worst in all of us. Ive definitely grown up since then...

"No. 

I don't want to date women, but I don't have a problem with women, I'm just heterosexual.

"I feel like women tying a man's tie is the equivalent trope.  Why would a woman be able to tie a tie better than a man?  Its possible because some men have never worn ties and some women have always worn them,  but that's hardly ever the case for the characters in the show.

Anyway, my dad always made this frankensoup thing that he learned from his mom, who grew up in the great depression.  Any soup and meat leftovers went into this large freezer-safe Tupperware.  Slowly, layers of flavors that should **never be together** were placed on top of each other and frozen.  When this Tupperware got full, you took it out of the freezer and heated it up on the stovetop.  Sometimes, it was alright because the flavors blended well together.  But for the most part, it was a disgusting mix of at least 3 different types of meat and uncomplimentary flavors.  Like cream soups mixed with spicy soups mixed with gravy from thanksgiving.  It was awful, everyone."
"""Owed"". I don't understand why it has to be made like a privilege. People in this day and age ARE indeed more open to transgender people, me included. But that doesn't mean that people want to date transgendered people. It sounds horrible, I know. It's mean. It's like telling you that we still can't see you as fully female or fully male, and the worst part is we can't deny that. We try our best to see you as the gender you truly hard, but we haven't reached that level. The world hasn't reached that level. And someday, you won't need to tell anyone you're transgendered :) you'll just be able to say ""I'm a girl"" or ""I'm a guy"". But for now, the world hasn't advanced enough. And knowing about your previous identity is something we would like to know, as it could affect our initial attraction to you, and if you tell us too late, we could see that as you hiding a super important secret and revealing it too late, ruining your chances further than if you told us in the beginning.

So no, you don't owe us anything. But if you love someone, or you think you've found someone who you can love and can grow to love you, it's only fair you share something that in this day and age is still important and significant. "

"I am not Deaf but I am an ASL interpreter so I have been involved in the community for many years and work with this community every day. 

Many hearing people always assume every Deaf person wants a cochlear implant and asks some version of the question ""you have a cochlear right?"" It's a very personal decision that has a lot of cons you will never see in a YouTube video gone viral about ""Deaf Baby Hears Unicorn Heavenly Chorus For First Time.""

Lip reading is unreliable and incredibly difficult. The BEST lip readers still only understand 30% of what is said. Also, it is not a skill that Deaf people innately have. If I had a nickel for every time a hearing person asked me ""why are you here, they can read lips can't they?"" I literally would not have to fucking work I would be so damn rich.

For Deaf people who DO use cochlear implants or hearing aids, making sure you have eye contact whenever you want to talk to them is important. Enunciation and speaking clearly is usually helpful too, but not overly exaggerated. In the same vein, speaking louder to a Deaf person does not make a difference most of the time.

Yes they can drive. I do not know why this is a widespread belief about Deaf people, but it's one of the first questions many hearing people ask them. "

Apparently my ex's mom made dinner for everyone, and she came upstairs to let us know. But when she opened the door, all she saw was her son's girlfriend wearing a short skirt on top of her son's friend and, of course, she didn't know about us opening the relationship to him. 

So as far as she knew, what she saw was me cheating on my ex by fucking his friend in his bedroom while my ex was downstairs lol.

It usually annoys me because, FFS, OP is probably like 15 years old and obviously needs some guidance on women if he is asking such a dumb question.

Needless to say, the people who'd been at the company 10+ years weren't very happy about a new college grad coming in and asking to work with them to implement any changes that they *knew* were much needed. After a few projects that went way over deadline, I got some advice from my closest coworker. Email, email, email. I started sending everyone meeting outputs, reminders for the deadlines they'd agreed on, and asking for status updates. Sometimes they'd come up with excuses, other times they'd just flat out ignore me. But then when the executives weren't happy with the delays, they couldn't use ""oh, the new girl didn't tell me a deadline"" as an excuse anymore.

I saw another post where a guy was instructed to dump his girlfriend because she went on a girls' night out, which apparently only happens because she's going to cheat on him.  Granted that was a red pill post, though.

This wasn't an instance of being told to dump someone, but I was told I made a mistake marrying my husband because almost 10 years ago when he was a college kid he made a joke that only ""wusses"" perform oral sex on women.

The next day, I got a text from him that said, ""I'm going to start watching *Buffy.* If I get sucked in and you don't hear from me for a while, it's all your fault."" Admittedly, the first season of that show can be a little rough - it was a mid-season replacement show after all. However, he spent the next two days watching the show and sending me texts about how horrible and stupid it was and asking how I could possibly like something so awful and he thought I was smarter than that!

Now, I didn't care that he didn't like the show - everyone has different tastes. It was the way he expressed disagreement that really put me off. All he had to say was something like, ""You know, this isn't really my thing."" There was no need to insult something he knew I loved and also insult me.

When I was 11 I had this awful anxious feeling around an older adopted cousin anytime my family went to visit him. I couldnt help but feel almost frightened by him but I didnt want to be rude because after all he is family. One day he wanted to show me the chickens my family raises in the farm next door and I followed him against my intuition. He raped me there and after that I have NEVER gone against that feeling.

Unless you are in IT and a woman especially. Then you aren't really in a technology career because you have to interact with people.

He was a moron.

"I don't think so. I chosen a STEM field because the elements of it came easily to me. 

My memorization and synthesis skills are strong and I am good at absorbing new information and integrating it with things I've already learned.

I think if I'd picked a liberal arts degree I would have had to work a lot harder because the types of work you tend to do don't come as naturally to me. 

I wouldn't say they take more work, just that the types of work are different and whether you're good at those types determines how much time and effort you'll need to put in.

I feel like we need more people who are open about their regrets and problems when it comes to stuff like this, not only for the solidarity it can bring others, but also for those people out there who feel extremely pressured to have children when they're not ready/don't want to. 

I always see so many stories about mothers who hated/didn't want kids but when they had them, they realized how wrong they'd been and their life instantly got better. If that's the case for them, that's awesome, but it makes people like me definitely feel unsure and confused to ONLY see stories like that. "

"The closest I can think of is lots of people (myself included) post in absolutes ""this is *never* okay!"" Or ""I'd never do that!"" When the world is shades of grey.

For example, last night I capitulated on a boundary and hard consequence with the guy I'm dating because we had a good conversation about it and I left enough ""okay but if it becomes a pattern then..."" because it felt okay to do. Normally here I'd say I'd never compromise a boundary or line I drew in the sand.

I think the reason for that is we get SO MANY posters here with zero social awareness that can't even see black and white nevermind shades of grey that it seems risky to give them a loophole."

Of course now those things are much more visibly accepted you get the ""girls are posers"" arguments. Nah we were always there, you just probably didn't notice me. 

Also I've noticed that female-orientated interests where people get super passionate usually get dismissed as banal or the women into them being stupid/obsessive rather than passionate.

My point being that ""passion"" isn't restricted to one sex. Also you get both men and women who really don't care that much about anything! I've had just as many conversations with men who aren't as into a sport as me as I have had the same conversations with women."
"The biggest one I remember bothering me at that age was standards of dress - mostly, how it seemed like boys could ""get away with"" wearing things to dressy events that would have been pointed out as too casual on me.

For example, wearing jeans and a polo shirt to church. I had a lot of fights with my mom growing up about the fact that church, and especially church holidays, meant I had to be wearing a fairly fancy dress or at minimum nice slacks and a classy top, while boys my age regularly attended church in khaki shorts or jeans and polo shirts.

But if I wanted to wear khakis and a polo to church it was ""inappropriate"" and ""too casual"".

"My mom gave me some really good advice when I had my children.  Keep your sense of humor and take an hour a day just for yourself.  I've tried to do that.  I was a young mom and really played a lot with my kids, be it  going to the beach, which we did every day in the summer, colored a lot, played games, sang, did a lot of free stuff, spur of the moment picnics where I would just put our lunch in a bag and we would go off and find an ""excellent"" but sometimes very buggy place for it.  I even planted a small strawberry patch and we would eat dinner and them retire to the patch for desert.  it was wonderful.  Because I was a single mom and their dad deserted us all it was really hard financially.  I made a real effort that my kids become friends and to depend on each other also and to this day with them being in their 40's and 50's they are still best friends.  In my home we were raised to be relatives and not to be close and I missed that terribly as a child.  I tell my kids and granddaughter every time I talk to them that I love them and am proud of them.  I worked sometimes 18 hours a day just to keep us under a roof and fed and they had to become self sufficient at a very early age while I worked, but I made sure to spend what time I could with them.  Finally I got a  job that was a 4 day work week and kept one of them out of school for a day every month and we would spend the day together doing whatever they wanted.  The school didn't like it at all but they needed that time with me and I with them.  That way I  could really keep in touch with what was going on in their lives.   I have been taking care of my granddaughter since she was 6 months old, she is now 16, and I did some of  same with her but I did not keep her out of school  just the other fun stuff.  we have a great relationship, she loves coming to me for overnights and after school.  She talks to me about everything and I mean everything.  We even had a club called the ""Peeps"" club because we like the marshmallow peeps so much, we had monthly meetings and would make plans for a special outings mostly free stuff of course.  For a long time I thought I would never find my passion and kept looking for it and then as I got older I realized that my family was my passion.  I am proud to say the my son graduated first in his class and is a bio-chemist and my daughter is an accountant.  My granddaughter loves music and is in her second year of violin and sings.  Mom you already terrific because you are caring. A child needs to know that when they enter a room your eyes light up with love."
"I'm in a love triangle right now. 

I love my husband and want his attention, he is too busy trying to get the dog to play with him and be his best friend, the dog only has eyes for me and follows me around all day, I just want the dog to give me a little bit of space so I can try and chill with the husband, alas he is distracted by the dog, and so on it goes.

I husband works away on a rig for weeks at a time so the dog sort of sees me as master and commander, also she's a rescue and I think she sees me as her saviour. It's sweet, I guess."
"He suggested we ride bikes to the cemetery at dusk. When we got there, a bat flew in front of the full yellow moon.

After that we biked to a bar and had dinner and I kissed him. That was in August, and we're still together.

"First semester of college, I had a professor who was a petite Greek woman and she *loved* to tell people her age.

In particular, after Shang tells (sings to) Mulan ""You're unsuited for the rage of war, so pack up, go home, you're through."" and hands her the reigns to her horse, instead of leaving, Mulan looks at the arrow at the top of the pole, figures out how to climb it and spends the entire night climbing the pole and fetches the arrow.  When seeing that part nowadays, I think ""that's some perseverance right there""."
"Well for certain people it can be a deal breaker due to the mental image it can create. Another separate issue is the perspective that some people will think that they are in a relationship with a different sex than what was initially portrayed and that can cultivate a sense of betrayal.

I was never made to feel like I couldn't do or understand anything because of my gender. I could lift things with complete ease when my girl friends had trouble. People automatically assumed that I knew what I was doing and would often turn to me to ask questions because I was usually the only, or one of the only guys in our group.

Now, I always get a shock when I find things difficult because nothing was ever difficult for me back then. I am tempted to quit more easily because I never had to push myself to achieve, people would be happy to do things for me.   
I'm always kind of shocked when people don't like me straight away and I take it too personally because I have never struggled before.  
I am just glad I have people around me now who will call me out when I'm being unreasonable because sometimes I don't realize that I am. I have to work hard to keep that side of myself in check."

"Yeah I think the reason I see so many men on the baby train as opposed to women is that men aren't expected to make the same kinds of sacrifices. They won't be putting their bodies through pregnancy. They won't be worrying about health risks. They quite often don't plan on taking time away from their careers. So many men I know seem to view kids as part of the overall checklist for adulthood, while the women hesitate because they see it as a completely life-altering circumstance.  "

"I was on a date with a guy when he told me how he broke up with his fianc√©e after going through her phone. He saw that she had been talking to her uncle and telling her uncle how her depression had come back really badly and she felt she couldn't talk to the guy. He told me himself that he knew he had been hard on her and hadn't supported her in the past, and he knew why she felt she couldn't come to him.

And then a complete 180, he told me he broke up with her in a horrible way because how dare she talk to her *uncle* about those things and not *him.*

I was horrified. He kept jumping back and forth between saying he was sorry for how things turned out (in response to my reaction), but immediately saying he doesn't regret anything. 

Something about the way he told the story made me feel very unsafe. It was like controlling and manipulative (and so, so much anger at her for talking to her uncle). Later on that night, he invited himself to my apartment even though I had specifically asked him not to do that (this was date 3. On date 2, I told him I didn't want this to happen). When he finally left, I went cold turkey on him and never spoke to him again.

Granted, in three dates I can't really know his entire personality, but I have a gut feeling I dodged a bullet with that one."

Like ""there may not be a cock here right now, but they were still born with one."" It'd be a mental image I wouldn't be able to get out of my head, total boner killer. 

If you're trans yourself or know somebody who is I'm sorry if this offends you, but I just couldn't go through with it. It would not change my opinion of them as a person though, it'd just mean crossing them off as a potential romantic/sexual partner. But spending time as friends, platonically? Absolutely, no issues there. "

"Ursula!

Months ago a user named /u/MontgomeryRook gave the most amazing breakdown of Ursula ever:

""I could gladly write a hundred pages on Ursula.  I think she's so fucking great.  I think she's a great antagonist to have opposite Ariel.  She packs a punch because she's smart, ambitious, and emasculating.

Here are some major points that stick out to me:

* Ursula's bottom half is an octopus, which seems like a real obvious way to make her sexually terrifying.  The junction of her legs is a frightening mess of suction cups and probably one of the more dangerous places in the ocean.
* Her game plan is to remove Triton's crown and trident, which are both pretty on-the-nose symbols of masculinity.  I mean, she turns him into a flaccid, shriveled sea-dick for christ's sake.  It's pretty straightforward.
* She's killed by the young, virile male character for some reason.  I mean, Ariel's the hero, but whatever I guess.  Uh, and she's killed when the handsome prince impales her with a wooden shaft.  It's a pretty graphic death for a Disney film, too.  Seems like Gaston got let off kind of easy with that ""fall real far, we'll assume you died off-camera"" thing when you compare it to Ursula getting fatally gored by a ship dick and struck by lightning a hundred times.

Ursula is cool as a female Disney villain because, when it comes to her sexuality, she's all take and no give, whereas Ariel is **CLEARLY** all give and no take.  This contrast is done on purpose.  It's a major moral point of the film and, whether intentional or not, gives a clear message about what female sexuality is supposed to look like.

Let's dig in a little.

Ursula is powerful, confident, raunchy, controlling, manipulative and sadistic.  She uses her frightening and mystical appeal to lure weak-willed people into agreements with her, leaving them powerless.  She keeps her conquests as trophies.  She's a dominatrix.  She doesn't take men seriously and can't be cowed.  She's a picture of female sexuality at its most terrifying (to men).

Ariel, on the other hand, is designed to be the film's sexual ideal. She gives up her voice, drastically alters her body, and bets her soul on a shot at being with a man who did not know her at all but with whom she had become utterly obsessed.  She belonged to Prince Eric from the moment she saw him.  Eric didn't have to win her - *Eric didn't even have to know her*.  Ariel was willing to sacrifice everything she had ever known in order to be with the first handsome man with two legs she ever set eyes on, and that's celebrated in the film.  That is, in fact, the plot and point of the film.  Ariel is the picture of female sexuality at its least threatening - at its absolute weakest.

When Ursula sees that the sexual attraction between Eric and Ariel is a threat to her ambitions, she uses witchcraft to usurp Ariel's sexual appeal to Eric and dominates Eric.  She literally bewitches him by making herself as sexually appealing as Ariel and pursuing him aggressively.  He's a joke to her.  If the movie was about Ursula trying to win Prince Eric, the movie would have been about two minutes long.  She *toys* with him.

And it works.  He's powerless to resist her until an external force intervenes (all of Ariel's sea creature friends physically attack Ursula).

Ursula eventually succeeds in seizing control of the ocean, so Eric, the mostly inactive hero of our story, defeats her by driving a giant rod into her until she dies.  Then, with Ursula out of the picture, Ariel is given to Eric by her father, and they all live happily ever after.  It bears repeating that both times Ursula is shown to be successful in bewitching a man, physical violence is the only way she is overpowered, and the second time, she is skewered to death with a giant phallic object.

I think there's more, but that's as good a place as any to stop.""

"I grew up upper-middle class. I had an ex who grew up lower middle class. He completely dismissed any of my life experiences, because of my upbringing. He'd throw my life in my face during arguments ""what do you know about anything? It's not like you've struggled for anything."" If I expressed upset at anything it was met with basically a sneer. It was like a reverse snobbism going on. He refused to respect me, because in his eyes I had it easy growing up. Therefore, everything I said was invalid. "
Well I only cried for *five.* Off to Weenie Hut Junior with you!
"I am 100% straight, so I would expect to be told up front.  I have no problem being platonic with someone who is trans, but to me, being romantically involved with them is out.  I don't know that I'd be able to be comfortable with it.  I would be extremely offended if I wasn't told before intimacy came into play.

I feel like I'm a horrible person for saying this because I'm such a supporter of equal rights for the LGBTQ community.

"My dad attempted to make my sister and I (probably 5 and 7 at the time) a seafood fettuccine.

My dad is banned from doing anything other than BBQ'ing"

Personally, I'd still like to know even if you're post-op just...I dunno, I feel like going through a transition is a big deal, I would want my partner to trust me with that info. But I also get that you want to leave that behind. It's a tricky balance.

For what it's worth, my fiance is trans (MtF) but she realized she was trans and started transitioning after we were together for awhile. "

"Yesterday I met my SO for dinner. He had on a nice button down shirt, swishy sweat pants which are too short for him (I don't know what they're called, but they make a lot of noise when you walk), black socks, and tennis shoes so old that the top is separated from the sole.

I asked him about it, and he said when he got home from work he stripped down to his boxers + socks. Then when he was getting ready to come to dinner, he wanted to be comfortable and couldn't find shorts (hence the sweat pants + tennis shoes). But he wanted to look nice for me, so he wore the button up on top.

He is so cute."

"I'm not quite 40 yet (35), but I have never wanted kids and never will have kids. All of my friends who have children do love their kids but at the same time really regret having them. They all say the same thing: it drains the shit out of you and you can't really have a life anymore, not a life of your own anyway. Everything is about the kid. 

One of my friends has a 12 year old and she told me just the other day, ""people who say it gets easier as they grow older are full of shit. It doesn't get easier. It's just a different kind of hard.""

Pretty much all of my friends had kids because they didn't even realize they had the option of not having one. To them, it was just something they were supposed to do eventually -- you grow up, get married, have kids. 

Really glad I never listened to all the people who urged me to have kids because ""they would give my life meaning"" or whatever."

Shouldn't the answer be almost everything? From dressing professionally to enjoying ice cream with fresh strawberries. The majority of any sane person's life is not about attracting a sexual partner.

"I don't know if this applies to people who don't suffer from self-loathing and depression, but I try to do one nice thing just for myself every day. I do a lot for my family and it's easy for me to slip into neglecting my own needs or wants. So every day, I try to do *something* that's just for me. Some days I go see a movie, sometimes I get myself some chocolate, or I make the food I want instead of trying to please everyone. 

It's usually a very small thing, but that's what I do."
"This is a very broad list, but basically we keep it to the things that happen frequently. 

Drink:

1. Someone already has a dress, but is still gonna try on others. 
2. Anytime someone cries.
3. Randy is brought in.
4. The family goes to pull dresses. 2 drinks if they pull dresses they know she doesn't want. 
5. Any time a dress above the price point is pulled. 
6. Anytime Vera shows up. 
7. Anytime Pnina Tornai is mentioned.  
8. If the veil solidifies a dress choice. 
9. Anytime someone shoots down a dress the bride loves. 
10. A belt changes someone's opinion about a dress. 
11. The bride has no idea what she wants. 

A shot: 

1. If the addition of a veil changes someone's opinion. 
2. If they buy a pnina tornai 
3. If they decided to 'make it work' to buy the dress that is out of their price range.
4. A celebrity is in the episode. (And a drink for every time the name of the celebrity is mentioned.)
5. A bride caves into the demands of her family and gets something she doesn't want. 
6. Anytime the bride leaves without buying. "

"My grandpa had the same experience as a kid. His mom would take all of the leftovers out of the fridge, mix them all together, bake it, and call it a ""casserole"". When my grandparents got married he told my grandma he hated any and all casseroles and would never eat it if she made it. One day my gma made an *actual* casserole and didn't tell him. He absolutely loved it and was totally floored when she told him what it was. "
Physical attraction. Women care about looks just like men do.
"I met her once at breakfast with mutual friends and liked her a lot. I thought she was funny and great. I then proceeded to tell her flat out we should be friends. She agreed but we were both really awkward... so I forced it. I made he come to dinner at my house where we ate a meal in relative silence, drank wine in relative silence, at a cupcake in total silence and watched an episode of John Oliver we had both already seen. 

The next day I texted her and said ""Now it can't get any worse. See you Friday night at your place for takeout"" and that was the end of the awkwardness. We just accepted it and now laugh and accept each other. We can't be too weird together because our first date was like the worst date you will ever have in your life. Been inseparable for three years. 

**EDIT**: I should note we tried this on other people that we wanted in our friend group. This was not a successful approach. Better was that the two of us invited potential lady friends over for ladies night and made a pitcher of cocktails that we drank around a table until people actually started doing more than small talk."
The guy I'm seeing had a very far away look on his face so I asked him what he was thinking about. After a bit of persuasion it turned out he was thinking about the Russian entry for Eurovision this year. It was just a very cute moment because he was a bit flustered about admitting to it.

"Removing tonsil stones.  Actually he caught me doing this once, and tried to lecture me about how it causes more problems than it solved and I kind of was dismissive about it.  Now I continue to do it in secret to save myself the lectures.

The rest of things, he has a general idea I do them, but I do keep the bathroom door shut when I do stuff."
I made breakfast AND ITS HAPPY TO SEE YOU!

"It has nothing to do with grammar or etiquette, and everything to do with fonts and legibility. Pre-computer age, we had monospaced fonts where each letter took up an equal amount of space. Since letters vary in width (O's are wide and I's are skinny) this leaves a ton of white space around each letter and you don't always see where one word ends and another begins. So to make sure people could see where a sentence ended, they included two spaces (or sometimes three) to give visual distance between sentences. With the advent of computer fonts, we have better typography that is visually proportional. We no longer need those spaces to help discern where words end and begin. But old habits die hard and many people who teach have forgotten they why behind the extra space.

"I am in my 40s without kids, but I'm also newly married for the first time. Kids without a husband was never an option for me, and the older I got, the less they became an option period. My husband very much wants them, but he's younger than me and is only just now beginning to understand what it would be like for us to chase around kids at our ages. Had I met him 10 years ago, without a doubt: children. But now, we plan to travel and live abroad and do the things we couldn't do with kids, at least easily. It's hard and sometimes there are tears, but we're moving forward and we'll be just fine. "
"I know this is a minor thing, but I haven't seen it mentioned yet: the pressure to have neat handwriting.

My teacher even got some of my female classmates to write out paragraphs as examples of what my writing should look like. I had to take them home and practice.

I get a lot of compliments on my writing now (to the point where one person in HS even paid me to rewrite her notes for her), but I still wish I hadn't been treated that way."
"""I ordered pizza."""
Absolutely.  I'm a strength athlete and software developer.  Being a man would be like taking steroids that made people speak to you more respectfully about technical topics.
"I was very much spoiled growing up. It did me absolutely no favors AT ALL though I know my mom did the best she knew how.  It went from my mom spoiling me to being an enabler though none of us realized it at the time.  

I lived in a rural town. My family has owned a restaurant that's been open for over fifty years now; and 20-30 years ago in our small city, business was booming. We had money coming out our ears. I wasn't silver spoon privileged or high class, but I had anything and everything I wanted. 

 my mom and dad divorced when I was barely 5, and my mom and grandma began to give me whatever I wanted because they wanted to make me happy. Wanted me to have a good childhood despite the lack of a father around. But it went overboard. 

I was relatively well behaved so I never learned consequences/punishment for my actions. I never had chores or an allowance - (if I wanted something they bought it, usually no questions asked.) which meant i didn't know the value of money. 

Couple all of this with incredible intelligence and eagerness to learn, and I breezed through school and childhood(mostly). I had very few friends because the kids with the same amount of money I had were very upper class and I was really soooo not. We have a diner and my mother was the cook every day so we weren't wearing flashy expensive furs and things. 

It was isolating being stuck somewhere between ""trashy"" , ""normal"" and ""upper class"".  So I turned to the Internet to escape in junior high. ~1996. 

When I graduated high school i didn't know how to cope with real life. I didn't know how to study,  and didn't know how to spend or save money. I couldn't relate to my peers. I didn't like to work, I didn't like to clean, I got credit cards and went shopping all the time and mommy put money in my account and paid all my bills for me. 

I got addicted to drugs and partying..... and in the worst of my addiction ... monthly I spent close to $3000 that my mom put in my account. when I asked for it she deposited it, or if I was bored/upset/lonely she would say ""well I put $400 in the account why don't you go shopping?"" It wasn't like I manipulated her to give me money. The total that year that she deposited into my account was around $54,000 usd. 

I was in rehab by 20. 

Clothes. Jewelry. Makeup. Shoes. Liquor. Drugs out the wazoo. She paid my rent and my bills while I was in ""college"" and I barely worked at all. 
 
I am incredibly blessed - while also it being a curse, that I knew absolutely nothing about real life. I couldn't function without mommy, which turned to I couldn't function without drugs, I didn't know how to take care of myself. I let my house get disturbingly gross bc I never picked up after myself. I just paid tweakers to clean it for me. 

This ended when I got arrested and pregnant at age 24. My family helped me get sober and on my feet; thru therapy we realized that we all had a part in letting my shit get out of hand; things changed and they helped me learn how to ""Adult"" .... but 7 years later i still struggle at times. 

Don't do this to your child. Please. "
"I've had groupies, so I have some insight into it. One of them I thought was my girlfriend for awhile, because she seemed genuine. But I started noticing that all her friends were in bands, some famous ones, and that she'd banged most of them. All her social media posts were bragging about who she was hanging out with, posing with my guitars, etc. 

I quit the band, and she lost interest. And then I recorded a solo album, and the night she heard it, she literally jumped me and we had sex outside her front door.

We're still sort of mates. She says she just really finds musicians attractive, especially when you see them on stage, and especially because you know they have tons of people who fancy them... so it feels special if they choose you. 

And she loves music, so has mad respect for them. Also she's obsessed with fame, it's a status thing. She basically wants to be the arm candy of some rock star, knowing that after the show with hundreds of girls screaming for them, they'll be going home with her. "

"The idea that a woman *should* be ashamed of aging, or should be reluctant to state her age after a ""certain number"" is ageist, sexist bullshit.

I'm 48.  Why the flying fuck do so many people assume that I'd be reticent to ""admit"" it? It's not shameful or bad or a crime to be a female human being over the age of 30, 40, 50, or whatever ""number"" we're told to be frightened of!

That being said, unless you are legally required to state your age, you have the right to keep that personal info private if you want.  I just don't think that *anyone* should be made to feel ashamed or dismayed about their age."

"The major change I made to my routine, to help improve my life overall, was to focus on habit-forming instead of goals.

Now on the 1st of each new month I start work on a new ‚Äò30-Day-Goal‚Äô, aiming to keep up a minimum 30 day streak by repeating a new positive habit every day (ideally in the mornings) until it sticks (http://www.lifehack.org/articles/featured/18-tricks-to-make-new-habits-stick.html)

As a result I have now formed the habits of; writing 1,000 creative words everyday, doing at least 30 minutes of exercise every morning, eating 5 portions of fruit and veg every day, reading a book for one hour every morning, meditating for 15 minutes each day, and (this was the most difficult habit to form for me personally) going to bed before 11pm every work-night.

Plus, beyond personal improvement, you can also use habit-forming tricks to help you get out of your rut.

For example, you could form the habit of doing one new novel action every day (this can be anything from something small like trying out a new drink at the bar, to something major like going skydiving)."

"-Being afraid to touch any of the stuff in their house because it's all so expensive

-Depending on the person, them treating going away for the weekend or something like no big deal when in reality you can't afford to go, or miss the time off work, and can't make spontaneous decisions about that shit because you'd need to save up just to go

-You have one (two, if you're lucky) dress that's dressy enough to wear to events, so you either look out of place among them in your shitty clothes or wear the same dress every time they invite you to something

-Watching the amount of waste some middle/upper-class families practice and screaming internally (when you're poor you never throw out the empty tubs of butter, you wash that shit and resuse the container, etc)

-Listening to them or their family talk about how awesome some new ""superfood"" is when you live off rice and hot sauce all semester

-Your views on politics and social issues might vary, and if not with your SO then you might run into one of their family members who doesn't understand poverty at all

-Listening to older female family members tell you all your life to find a ""man with a good job/money to support you"" and when you do date someone like that they become jealous or act like you're just in it for the money/status

-The guilt that comes with not being able to afford to do stuff they want to do or not being able to afford to eat where they want to eat

-They might not understand that no, you can't just take the day off/call in sick, you actually need that money to pay rent

"The best advice I've ever been given was: ""Don't assume the company owes you anything. If you want something, you have to push for it yourself"". It was good advice as it has made me more inclined to put myself out their and push for what I want to get out of my career."
"I had my son when I was 18 years old. I was dumb and in love wanted to start a family. I love my son. But it was hard and I was so young that I didn't know myself at all. Now that I am almost 40 and he is 20 I am finally able to do things for me. Where I live is no longer determined by good schools and doctors. I don't have to live near his dad anymore so we can switch weekends (shocker that we didn't stay together). I don't have to take crap jobs to make ends meet because now my budget doesn't include school clothes and supplies. I can travel when I want, read what I want, sleep in. He is an adult and now I finally get to be me.

I don't regret my son, but there is a reason I only have one. To be honest, kids suck sometimes. They crush your soul and your spirit. Like another poster said, you can love your kids but not like being a parent. It is true. I hated parent teacher conferences, stupid kindergarten plays, 5th grade graduation, colds, fevers, boo boos, buying Christmas presents, making dinners (dang kids need to eat EVERY day, more than once). Being a parent is about raising them for 18 years. Your life is pretty much put on hold so they get everything they need.

There is nothing wrong with not wanting to be a parent. Don't let anyone tell you differently."

"Keep in mind, though, that people only tell the horror stories. Sorta like the news: ""Parents adopt 7 kids. All went fine."" That's my siblings and my story and it's pretty mundane. hah. 

The first time, I was single and had a little girl for a year. Her parents (that I'm still in touch with) needed some time to get clean (and have stayed sober!!) so I had her. I'm glad that she and her parents are doing well and they since had another little girl - I send them Christmas cards and chat on FB. 

The next time, we had 2 boys (twins, met at age 13, took into formal temp. custody at 14) from 14-18. Since we knew them for awhile, none of us pretended that we were their parents - so the transition went really smoothly. They moved out last summer and are about to turn 19... I oddly miss the little stinkers, but I'm glad to see them being awesome, almost-adults. They call me ""madrina"" which means godmom, or just by my name. I think that's the perfect balance and I'm happy to still be in their lives, providing guidance whenever I can (and lending money and doing them favors) 

If fostering is for you, definitely look into it! There are a lot of agencies that can help with costs, forms, etc. It's a bit of a bureaucratic hurdle, for sure, but it was a great experience that I plan to repeat as soon as feasible.  "
"I'm sure I was abusive, in an emotionally manipulative way, when I was an alcoholic. But I was so drunk that I can't remember specifics now. I lied a lot, stressed her out. Made her feel responsible for me.

I felt extremely, extremely guilty about what I'd done to her. So one day I packed up all my boxes and then wrote a note saying I loved her. Then I went on a 3-day walk to find somewhere to kill myself, because I didn't want her to have to find my body. I spent days with the drugs in my hands, poised to do it. Finally, I gave myself *one* more chance. I figured the way to make it up to her would be by getting better. 

Soon I became functional again, and a few years later I was sober. By that time, she had moved across the Atlantic. But I saw her last year, after not speaking for 3 years. And when I told her I was totally sober and not doing any drugs - wow, I'll never forget the look in her eyes. So happy. "
"Biotroofs like men naturally being primarily attracted to women based on appearance and women being primarily attracted to men based on money/power.

I mean that plus a ton of others, but that one huge tenet of redpillosophy irritates me a lot."
I'm not domestic. I think I'm going to be one of those women who hires people to clean her house.
"Currently 65, enjoying retirement, grandchildren, traveling, loving my husband of 42 years and loving life.  But I frequently think back over my youth and think that maybe I wasn't a good girlfriend, daughter, wife, mother, teacher, etc.  It makes me sad, but then again it is in the past and there is nothing I can do about it now except be the best I can be in the years remaining."
"My answer to those who are undecided is if your answer isn't a resounding Yes, then it should be a No. If you aren't sure, and you decided to have kids, your life is irreparably changed forever. You have created life. And if you hate it, too bad. There is no ""fixing"" that. And it isn't good for the potential child either, to be raised by someone who doesn't want them, who doesn't like having them. The answer should be no, unless you can say 100% yes."
"Honestly when some guy complains that women are complicated, I just feel like... if you treated your girlfriend as a human being who has unique needs and methods of communication, and actually sought to understand her, maybe you'd get somewhere? ""Women are complicated"" as a blanket generalisation actually just feels like he isn't willing to engage and communicate with his partner at all, and would rather sit back and stereotype.

Also, too often women are told that they can't be direct or they can't come out and say what they want? As if there's not a social factor in this too. Honestly, just meet them halfway."
"Oh, I'm very much Tina.  I liked a lot of boys who didn't like me, write tons of fanfiction, I love zombies, I am probably occasionally weird and inappropriate.  

Also I literally only needed to buy a wig to [cosplay as her.](http://i.imgur.com/dfgx01E.jpg)"
I'm pretty sure my problem is just that no bra will ever be as comfortable as not wearing a bra in the first place.

I was sitting around at my computer in college once with my pants only half on just because I was feeling too lazy to stand up and put them on properly.  Then my room-mate came home early from class.  I WASN'T MASTURBATING I SWEAR.
"I remember being in elementary school and being very aware of the fact that we never, ever read books about girls. When we were assigned reading, the central character was invariably a boy. When the teacher read aloud to us for fun, those books were about boys, too.

My guess is it was taken for granted that stories about girls are ""special interest"" whereas stories about boys are for everybody."

It doesn't hurt that much. The pores are pretty open there.
"95% of the posts in these threads are usually things like ""It was so hard and I was miserable for x amount of time but I love them to death now and it's so rewarding."" That's not even what's being asked. Hardly any of them are as on topic yours."
"I firmly believe there should be an age minimum of at least 21 to work in the sex industry. 

I personally think eighteen is too young to be able to fully comprehend the choice to work as a stripper, a prostitute or be in porn. I think eighteen is too young to be able to protect yourself from all the various forms of exploitation that is often part of the job. I understand that eighteen is the age in which one is for the most part considered an adult, but I don't expect or believe that a teenager is ready to promote, advertise and sell their sexuality having not yet had the time to become comfortable with their sexuality as an adult, in terms of dating, experimentation, how they want to be seen sexually. 

I have heard many say that eighteen is too young to choose to go to war, which I personally agree with, but not many say that eighteen is too young to be a sex worker."

"I'm deaf and wear hearing aids, with rudimentary asl skills due to lack of practice.  Most deaf people i know are very accommodating to slow down or use a notepad to communicate.  However, many others I've come across act insulted when I ask to slow down the sign speed or finger spell the phrase being used.   The latter group is entirely Deaf, and quite literally see me as a traitor to their culture.

"I lost my job, I won't sugarcoat it, I was fired, after working steadily as a lawyer for about 9 or 10 years at that point, including 7 at the job I was fired from.  I have bipolar disorder and my moods were up and down, and after being unemployed for about 8 months, were in the garbage.  I had just been turned down for a temp document review job, which is the bottom of the barrel for any lawyer.  I didn't know what to do at that point and I felt like such a complete loser.  I had to make money and I considered prostitution.  The only thing that stopped me was its illegality.  If it were legal, that's probably where I would've ended up.  

I finally got a job in my ninth month of unemployment.  It was a job I applied to when I was still employed and I had interviewed for a couple of months after my discharge.  At first I was high enough off that.  I had insurance again, so I got back on some medication to stabilize my moods.  I slowly crawled out of my financial hole.  "
"Because many of them don't enjoy it, particularly the getting rejected part.

I personally am of the camp that hints *are* impossible to read. I don't really blame them."
"I'm willing to bet that countries that enable easy access to abortion are the same countries that emphasize teaching kids about sex in a non-insane manner.

I think the easy abortion clinic does nothing to minimize abortion rate but is a signal that the society deals with sex in an open and healthy manner. "

"&gt; it was taken for granted that stories about girls are ""special interest"" whereas stories about boys are for everybody.

Amazing how true that still rings in so much of popular entertainment today, isn't it? If your protagonist is a twenty-something who dates a bunch while seeking life's true purpose, it's general fiction if he's male and ""chick lit"" if she's female. Movie or TV show's cast is mostly women? ""Chick flicks."" "
Because they're coded as both masculine and nerdy.

"My mother was born deaf and was taught to read lips and speak. She has a bit of an ""accent"" but she has gotten easier to understand throughout her life.


Telephone use has gotten in the way of possible job opportunities, so she worked in factories. Other times she needed to use the phone to get something activated and she had me pose as her on the phone. 


With reading lips, she gets frustrated with people who cover their mouths, look away while speaking, talk too fast, or don't move their lips when they speak.


Her brother is also deaf but he uses ASL to communicate and doesn't seem to like going out. He really doesn't venture past the deaf community very much. While growing up he went to a school for deaf children, and my mother went to a regular public school because she wanted to be like everybody else. She's gotten along in the hearing world with the help of her mother, my dad, my sister, and me."
"When I asked my dad if he wanted to do something for Father's Day he said he wanted me to vote leave. I'll do anything for love, but I won't do that.

I think his decision came from the same place as your dad's comment about rights. My dad told me he was voting leave because of ""political correctness"" and people no longer being able to ""say what they mean"".

I said dad, you can still go around saying whatever the hell you like. The EU has not gagged you. People are just more likely to call you out for being a racist/homophobe/whatever than they were 40 years ago. I see that as progress in society (because of course everyone should fucking have rights) and really nothing to do with the leave/remain argument."
"I'm younger and I work with people much older than me (20 year age gap, generally?). One of my favorite memories was someone showing me a picture of their nephew, I forced out an ""aww"" and she immediately caught me on my shit-- ""You don't like babies do you?"" Laughed, and never bothered me with it again. "
"&gt; EDIT: Because it seems to have been unclear. I meant that I feel bad because I imagine plucking nipple hairs hurts like hell.
