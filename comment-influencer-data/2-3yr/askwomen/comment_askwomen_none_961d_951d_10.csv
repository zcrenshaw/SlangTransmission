"Fly somewhere where it was legal and have it done.  But, this is possible for me because I have money. 

If that wasn't possible, troll around different doctors until I found out how an illegal abortion could be done, pay a lot for that.

"I hooked up with this guy a few times who I had good chemistry with.  He wasn't bad in bed but he was so freaking awkward about sex.  
We were making out naked, and he hadn't touched me anywhere between my legs.  He decides it's penetration time and gets up to get the condom from the bedside table.  Before opening the condom and putting it on, he reaches down and puts one finger inside me and takes it out in one movement, then puts the condom on.  With no words.  I felt like he was checking the oil.  

Edit: a word"

"If I had the money, or could get a loan, I would travel to a country where it is legal.

If that was not an option, get an illegal abortion. My first attempt would be through organizations that ship pills to anti-choice countries (or air drop them with drones sometimes, afaik.) If that wasn't an option, maybe see if a doctor or veterinarian was running an underground operation. Failing that, back ally coat hanger.

Failing ALL of that, I would give myself alcohol poisoning, as many times as it took.

"The ""rape for empowerment"" trope. She's strong because she was raped, abused by her father, etc.

"I agree with the overall sentiment, but I disagree about her in particular. The whole point, as I interpreted the series, is that the three of them only function together. They each have what the other two need. Hermione has the intelligence but she doesn't have Harry's bravery or Ron's quick thinking/haphazard luck. Even the stuff Harry does on his own can only be done with prior help from the other two. "
"&gt; Women waking up in the morning with a full face of makeup and perfectly styled hair.

My favorite scene in Bridesmaids is at the beginning when she's sneaking back into bed with the guy after putting on makeup and fixing up her hair, then she acts like she's just waking up."
"Seeing these responses makes me very glad that I, as a man, cannot get pregnant and a lot more supportive of the pro-choice movement.  
 
If women are willing go to lengths as extreme as this, if pregnancy is literally that much of a burden, I'm going to donate to planned parenthood right now and look for other pro-choice organizations to donate to.  
  
Thank you all for giving me perspective. "
Had what I thought was just going to be a one night stand with a dude. In the morning he confessed that he'd been interested in me for years and that his dreams had come true and started talking about our future. It was very awkward. 
"It's always so easy to tell when a man is writing when it comes to describing women, especially attractive women. Now, if I were describing the above situation as it would happen if it were me, it'd probably go like this:

I woke up, threw off the covers, and stretched before getting out of bed. On my way to the closet, I noticed how badly my boobs hurt from just walking, they must be getting sore and swollen from PMS, fuck. I stopped in front of my mirror, yup they're swollen all right. I poked them a couple of times, yup they're definitely sore. I cup them with my hands, like a makeshift bra, so they don't bounce anymore on the way to my closet to get dressed for the day. The end."
This is what anti-choice people do not understand. If a woman does not want to be pregnant she will find away even if she ends up dead. It makes me angry that they do not take that womans life into consideration. 
Confide in me more. Tell me about his mistakes and failures. See me more as a partner/companion and not someone who always need him to be a rock.
"Oh man, she has a line in Modern Family where she says something along the lines of ""you have no idea how smart I am in Spanish.""

No periods would be GREAT.
"I hate the women never want to have sex unless they're morally deficient, especially when paired with the men always want to have sex trope. It's so hurtful to both genders. Women feeling ashamed of their urges and like something must be wrong with them if a guy doesn't want them. Men feeling like something is wrong with them if they don't want sex. "
Latina women are super hot/exotic/dumb (a la the recent discussion of Sofia Vergara) or are only there to be the love interest and get no character development other than being a stereotype.
"Warning: This is a slightly graphic story. 



Hooked up with this cute guy for a night, both of us just wanted a one night stand or a FWB at max. We started having sex and it was pretty great, felt good then suddenly he pulls out and his condom is COVERED in blood. Like covered. I got really freaked out and told him embarrassingly that my period is a little weird to which he said (to my horror) ""it isn't you, it's me"". I just looked at him trying to understand how he could have been on a period (my brain was not working) and then he took the condom off (which now had a mix of semen and blood in it, SORRY for the TMI) and showed me some stitches on his penis that had ripped during sex (he said I was too tight). He also said ""can't believe this happened again"". Thankfully nothing was on me, I washed up and left and we never spoke again. "
"For whatever reason, people haven't been willing to send a random girl on the internet their 1040 or 1040EZ. Can you believe it?"
"Not advice so much as... guidance? But one of the most defining interactions I've had with my mom was when I was 12. I had my period for I think the second or third time and was a hormonal mess. I was standing in the kitchen before school throwing a small tantrum about how I didn't want to wear my pajamas for pajama day because the whole idea was stupid. She came up to me and said, ""You know what I think? I think you don't want to have to go to school and deal with your period.""

So then I just started sobbing. She said, ""Look. Every parenting book in the world says I'm supposed to tell you this is the greatest thing that's ever happened to you. This means you're a woman now, and you should be so happy. I'm going to be honest. This sucks. It's gross and messy and inconvenient. There are only three good things about it, and they're you, your sister, and your brother. The rest of it's terrible. But you know what? You're going to be okay.""

And she held me for awhile and then she made me eat some breakfast and put my pajamas in my backpack ""in case you change your mind when you get there"" (I did). But for so many bigger and harder things, it's been invaluable to be able to say, ""This sucks, and I will be okay."""
"EVERY DAMN SITCOM EVER. ...because no matter what a lying idiot your ugly-ass husband is, you stand by him and forgive him in maximum 24 hours. Oh, and if you have a problem with him, the correct way to proceed is to withdraw sex. Sex is also a treat you can use when your husband has been a good boy. It has nothing to do with the wife, it is only there to punish/award the husbands behavior."

"This is super petty, but my eyelids are shaped slightly differently and I can never get my eye makeup perfectly symmetrical because of it."
"I think that the nature of sexism that makes it different from things like racism, homophobia, etc. is that the way it manifests isn't so much against all women as it is women who don't conform to strict social roles.

If you do all the things you can to look beautiful, sexy but not too sexy, stay home, raise children, don't speak, defer to men, keep your opinions under wraps, you're taken care of and protected.  You're placed on a pedestal.  People buy you drinks.  But only if you behave exactly how society wants women to behave.

Women are raised to embrace those things, or the world is going to shit on them.

Is it such a surprise to you that women who spent decades of their lives learning to like the things they're supposed to like and being the things they're supposed to be, knowing that they'd be devalued if they didn't like and be and do those things, especially those who live in communities where they have no opportunities to like and be and do those things, and know no women close to them who like and be and do those things, might devalue the people who do?

People adopt the opinions of their social circle if they don't want to be cast out of their society."

"I really really despise the 'cool girl.' For reasons stated in the monologue in *Gone Girl,* mostly, but I find the obsession with being the ""cool girlfriend"" or ""one of the guys"" IRL to be the source of much dissatisfaction in dating relationships that I know of, or worse, accusations of being a nag. 

FFS, when my BIL says that I'm ~NAGGING~ for asking my husband to try on the pants (that I ordered, brought in the house, unwrapped, and gave to him, and yes, it has to be done right now because I'm going to the post office and if they need to be returned, I can 2-for-1 the trip), it makes me insanely mad that he thinks a 'cool wife' shouldn't ever ask for anything (FOR HIM!) ever. It makes me mad just thinking about that and how much he accuses his own SO of ""nagging"" even though it's 2 entirely different actions that are described as nagging. No, I'm not ""cool,"" I'm actually quite tightly wound, but you know what?? Being 'cool' isn't a thing that my husband needs in a partner, and he quite likes that my uppity-ness translates into tidy, efficient lives for us. Just because you don't like *your* partner and wished she was cooler, don't project that shit onto me! 

...I've gone on a tangent. In a word, I hate ""cool girl"" tropes and how that's some noble goal that all women/ girls that are married or dating should strive to be - the utmost compliment  "
"I work as assistant in a management consultancy, so it's a very ""business-y"" place. 
When I had my interview I just asked if I could bring my dog (well behaved, small, trained) very once in a while. After a month I brought him for a day. The next day I came without him and everybody asked where he is and why he wasn't with me. So from the next day on he came to the office every day and everybody loves him. 

When we get clients here they are usually excited as he is pretty, well behaved and super friendly. He ignores people that don't want contact and stays close to the ones that pet or feed him. We had CEOs of very big companies here that shared food with him or brought dog treats.

He comes over to my place. We fuck like rabbits, cuddle a bit, then it's time for him to leave. He said God Bless before almost closing the door behind him. I snickered and said yeah. He stopped dead in his tracks. He asked what was that? I said I don't believe in gods. Suddenly he turns on Christian boy mode and is compelled to witness to me. He says he'll ask for forgiveness for the hook up and pray for me. He had guys give him blow jobs before but he's not gay because god forgave him. I was just like... Omg leave."
Jennifer Lawrence did that story on Graham Norton where she talked about straight up disrespecting Hawaiian culture which was kinda sad.

"My situation is a little different than a lot of others. My husband has multiple sclerosis. 

Right now, he's doing great. But it's going to eventually progress to the point where all of his sexual function is gone (not just penis, but hands, tongue, etc) sometime before he dies. 

He has told me to discreetly have sex with someone else at that point. 

I'm 30. We honestly have no idea at this point how fast this will progress and for how long. His dad also had MS and died young, but he's doing a lot better than his dad was at the same age. 

He'd rather I not go without sex at all for 15-20 years, while I'm caring for him. 

This type of arrangement is pretty common in these situations. Not many people think about how chronic and / or degenerative illness impact a couples' sex life and how long people can live while still being extremely incapacitated. 

Edit: If it were me who was ill, I'd do the same for him also.

"I went on one date with this guy and he was really, really boring. When we texted he was so interesting and had a ton to talk about, but when we met, we had no chemistry and our conversation didn't flow at all. I figured I'd give him another chance cause he was still kinda cute and really considerate and very well educated, so he could tell me a lot of cool stuff about plants and stuff.

Second date's at his apartment and I show up and conversation is just plain dead despite all my efforts to keep it afloat. He's got a cat and I'm petting it for like two hours, which is entirely uncharacteristic of me. I'm allergic to cats and the feeling of hair freaks me the fuck out.

Eventually he's like 'can I kiss you?' and I figure yeah sure whatever we'll fuck and get this over with and then I'll go home. Unfortunately he's legit the worst kisser I've ever kissed. His mouth keeps going around my mouth, like he's just trying to eat my lips or something. I'm just like what the fuck I'll just kiss something that's not his face, but his entire body is like, salty? Maybe he was nervous or something I dunno.

We eventually move to his bedroom and we're fooling around and he's fuckin doin his darnedest to finger me but he's got no clue what he's doing and I'm so uninterested at this point that I'm just like whatever I've just gotta fake it and then we'll fuck and then I'm out of here. His cat comes in the open door during my performance and sits on the bed next to me and he does nothing about it. It watches us.

When he's done that he gets up to get a condom. I've got really bad eyesight, but I've taken my glasses off because this dude does not know how to keep his face off them. He comes back with a condom on and I feel like I can see that something is weird about it, but I just figure I'm imagining things. I should note now that his penis is small. Like, exceptionally small. This isn't a problem at all for me; it's just relevant.

He's on top of me and the cat's still watching and he just keeps saying my name and honestly if it was anybody else it'd be super hot but no I'm just nauseated by it. He's taking a while so I suggest we move positions; I'm getting on top and I go to guide him back into me and something is Wrong.

The condom is missing. It's not on the bed and it's not on his dick. There's only one place it could possibly be. I have to tell him twelve times to leave before he actually leaves the room. He just keeps moving slightly further away with his hands over his face knowing what's happened and completely powerless to fix it. The cat does not respond to my instructions.

I fish the condom out of my body and tell him I'm leaving cause it's weird. He says 'yeah, that's happened before...' and what was an uncomfortable and embarrassing mistake between us turned into an egregious offense.

I ended up texting another guy I was dating who lived nearby and telling him the story and he told me to come over and I screamed a bit, cleaned up, and had a pretty nice time with the rest of my evening.

Later on I wrote the guy a long text saying pretty much 'it's not a problem that you need smaller condoms; it's a problem that you use the wrong size and didn't learn the first goddamn time. Also you need to practice kissing and I'm blocking you.'"

The day abortion became illegal I would just get my tubes tied. I would never give birth in a world where so many unwanted children are born due to the ignorance of establishments telling women what they can and can't do with their bodies. I would just adopt.

I will never forget what she said in reply. ""From here on out , for the rest of your life you will encounter these people. There will always be people that don't do their homework. Now go out there and show them what they are missing.""

"Gonna be honest with you: as a married guy, I also hate this trope.  It's like the stereotype for being a married man is that I'm going to let myself go, not help around the house, and generally need my wife to be a second mother.

That said, I can't help going bald.  Just gonna cross my fingers for a few more good years on that one.

P.S.  If you are looking for something like a sitcom with a better take on this stereotype, Bob's Burgers is great.  Everyone in that family is a mess in their own way, but they all love each other and aren't just plain mean to each other.  Bob (the husband) is on the fat and bald side though.  This ol' ship turns slowly."
"There was a top post on TrollX over the weekend that said something like ""The older I get, the more I understand Britney spears meltdown"". It's so true.

I'm pretty sure my boss likes the dog more than me, haha. Clients like him, the mail man brings him treats, even the tellers at the bank give him goodies when we go make deposits. I'm in Seattle though so it's pretty dog-friendly everywhere. Mostly he sits behind me in my computer chair or sleeps in a little bed in the corner of my office.

"When they just add a woman to a team because woman.  She has no skills that are valued by the team, she just hangs around because romantic interest or something."
"Preteen girl characters in kids' shows whose defining interests are ""boys"" or ""love"" or ""shopping"", when a) girls of that age would be unlikely to have those interests as *the most important thing to them* and b) the rest of the plot is twisted to make these interests seem shallow and silly, as if boys weren't *also* interested indirectly in those things - 'shopping' is essentially just getting things you want. And 'love' and 'the opposite sex' are pushed *hard* as things that adolescent - and even preteen, sometimes - males *live for*!

On that point I'm also not a big fan of 'dating' and romance storylines at all on shows aimed at or starring preteens and early teens. Why can't everyone just be friends together and let 'best friends' be the highest level of relationship you go to?"

"Years ago, it was Valentine's Day. I had broken up with a guy the night before, and some single friends and I went to the gay bar to dance. I met this dude there and we were flirting - he was cute, but nothing special, and there were some obnoxious aspects to his personality. For example, he was bragging about his paycheck and he took it out and showed it to me; I don't remember the amount but I remember it wasn't as impressive as he thought it was, lol. 

So this wasn't someone I'd date but I was looking for a hookup and nothing more. We decided to leave the bar and go hook up. I was living with my parents at the time and he said he was too, but we could park in the driveway of his parents' house and have sex there. I agreed (again, I was younger and had been drinking and i would NOT do this today). 

So he directs me to his driveway, I get on top of him in the passenger seat, he puts on a condom, we have adequate sex, he comes and I'm just like ready to be done with this guy at this point. I'm back in the driver's seat getting my clothes in order when a man comes out of the house.

I'm like, ""Is that your dad?"" He says no. I ask who it is. He says, ""I don't know, this isn't my house!"" All incredulous, like I was ridiculous for asking. I am PISSED now and I peel out of the driveway. I don't want to fully cuss him out but I basically tell him he's an idiot, an asshole, and to stop talking to me. 

When I dropped him off by the bar we met at, he tried to convince me to drive him and his friend to a party. I had to yell at him to get out of my car. 

I've had a few regrettable hookups, but that was probably the most shameful. "
"Johnny Depp would be a big one. My friends and I were fans growing up, seeing the mainstream films in theaters and going out and renting the more obscure stuff until we'd seen it all.

""If you can, you should try to get a prescription for misoprostol, cytotec, Mifepristone, Cytotec, Arthrotec, Oxaprost, Cyprostol, Mibetec, Prostokos or Misotrol. All of which are pills that cause abortions.

In some countries, these can be over the counter. While other people may have to resort to using https://www.womenonweb.org. They will send you pills if you fit certain criteria.

This will get me downvoted. And this is a true last resort if you can't get a flight out of there or you cannot get one of the pills.

If you are very healthy otherwise, and truly, super desperate. You can try an herbal abortion. It will only work in the early weeks though.

But basically, you combine one herb from group a and one herb from group b, and make a tea. Note that it isn't the safest or most efficient, but desperate times and all that Jazz.

""Group A (choose one):

Cotton Root Bark (Gossypium herbacetum)
Part used: bark of the root, cut and broken up like tea Properties: emmenagogue, imitates oxytocin (childbirth hormone that triggers labor) Preparation: decoction,1 teaspoon of bark per cup of water, 3 cups per day for a maximum of 6 days. We suggest to use only organically-grown cotton root bark, as cotton plants grown for fabric production are heavily sprayed with pesticides.

Pennyroyal (Mentha pulegium)
Part used: entire plant, broken up, dried Properties: emmenagogue, aids gall bladder and digestive tract Preparation: infusion,1 teaspoon per cup of water, 3 cups per day for a maximum of 6 days. CAUTION:Do Not Use extracted pennyroyal oil, which is toxic and potentially lethal! The tea recipe as given above, consumed for that limited amount of time, is safe.

Mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris)

Part used: entire plant, broken up, dried Properties: emmenagogue, antispasmodic Preparation: infusion,1 teaspoon per cup of water, 3 cups per day for a maximum of 6 days. CAUTION: Do Not Overdose! More than 40g per liter causes hepato-renal disorders and convulsions. Contra-indications: uterine inflammation, recent pelvic inflamation.

Group B (choose one):

Parsley (Petroselium sativum)
Part used: entire plant, broken up, dried. Do Not Use the seeds. Properties: cleanser, diuretic, stimulates menstruation Preparation: decoction,1 teaspoon per cup of water, 3 cups per day for a maximum of 6 days. CAUTION: Do Not Overdose! Parsley is toxic in high doses. The seeds are even stronger than the plant and should not be used because they are dangerous particularly to the kidneys.

Blue Cohosh (Caulophyllum thalictroides)
Part used: root, cut and broken up like tea Properties: emmenagogue, imitates oxytocin, antispasmodic, diuretic Preparation: decoction,1 teaspoon per cup of water, 3 cups per day for a maximum of 6 days.

Black Cohosh (Cimifuga raremosa)
Part used: entire plant incl. root, cut and broken up like tea Properties: emmenagogue, antispasmodic, diuretic Preparation: decoction,1 teaspoon per cup of water, 3 cups per day for a maximum of 6 days.""

"Another layer of BS I found in this:

"All I can think when that happens is how my wiry hair looks when I take it down - it just kinda... stays in ponytail-shape, and shaking it gives me mane-head."

"Don't spend any time with people who don't appreciate, support, rally for, or otherwise don't make you feel like you're not the amazing person you are.  I spent so much of my early 20s with people who weren't worth my time - I'm talking boyfriends/SO's, but also friends and even family.

Also, never stop learning. Just because you're past college age, doesn't mean you have to stop learning about new things.  Whether it's about subjects, current events, cultures, even yourself.  You will never be happier when you understand how things that interest you work, and when you know yourself, what you want, and what you don't want. Life will be a thousand times more easy and enjoyable this way.

Good luck, this is a great time of your life!"

"Where I live abortion is illegal, and doctors aren't allowed to tie the tubes of anyone who's young and/or doesn't have too many kids (less than three, iirc). My sister is 32, doesn't have or want kids, and has seen dozens of doctors who tell her they can't do it.

"One small thing I noticed was how easily I could take the stairs to my car after work. Before I started working out I'd have to take a break before I reached the 6th flight of stairs to the 3rd floor parking garage. Now I do it without thinking, half the time I'm not even breathing that hard by the time I arrive. Not a HUGE deal, but after a long shift on my feet, it sure is nice to still have plenty energy for physical things like that.

"My complaint was how mushy she got at the end of the movie when she saw her sister with the kids.

For once I'd like to see a female character, who doesn't want kids and makes it clear at the beginning, continue to not want kids.

"I hooked up with an ex of mine a couple months after we'd broken up. I had ended the relationship, but it was because he didn't want to move the relationship forward, because he ""wasn't sure,"" so I figured it would be fine.

Yeah, the sex itself was great. But afterwards he just sobbed for a really long time about how much he missed me. The feeling was not mutual, and it was very awkward. "

"Yes lesbians are lesbians because we hate men... or were raped, or abused by our fathers, or can't get men, or want to be like men, take your pick of the many ridiculous reasons (all involving men)! 

And gay guys are gay because their father was absent, or they were molested by a man, or didn't have enough manly men around them. Men men men.

"Apparently, Parsley seeds and stems can be used to promote a miscarriage.

"I started reading a fantasy series and had to quit once I finished book 1 because I couldn't stand how often the author referenced the female character's boobs. The two main characters are a Prince who has been exiled by his father, and a girl who breaks him out of prison and spends the rest of the book following him around. It was a decent set up, but every single time we read a chapter that was the female character's perspective, she was constantly noticing her own boobs.

Like her boobs are too big. And she's always like, ""gosh these big boobs, why couldn't I have smaller boobs"". She wears armor at one point, and she mentally complains that the armor was squishing her boobs and making them sweaty. Thanks for that, author. Added a whole lot of depth to that character. I found it all amusing at first, cause I can see how wearing armor with large breasts would be irritating, but this author made his character reference her own boobs at least once every chapter. It drove me nuts.

edit: The book was called ""The Fate of the Fallen"" by Ian Irvine, it's part of the Three Worlds Cycle series apparently. [Here is a link to the GoodReads page for the book.](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1629941.The_Fate_of_the_Fallen)"

"After being in labour for 20 hours and starting to feel really sorry for myself I told my mom that I couldn't do it, that I was too tired, that it hurt too much, that I just wanted to stop and sleep.

My mom held my hand and told me ""the part when it feels like you can't do it anymore is the part that comes right before you need to push. You're almost there sweetie."" 

10mins later it was time to push and before I knew it I was cuddling my own daughter!

This seems to be common in YA novels: female characters with a mind of their own are seen as outliers instead of being seen as just another person. She states her opinions? She's the rebel of the family! She's got other concerns besides dating? She's the outcast of her school! She's strong willed? She's the hero of the story! As if there's only ever one female in any given situation who actually is capable of being strong and independent.

I get enough unwanted PM's as is if I reveal myself to be a woman on a default sub. "

"Ok I have a funny story, sorry for the length.

So I was 18, just out of my first serious relationship with the man I thought I was going to marry (lol). We dated for a year and a half, lost my virginity to him, and he broke up with me over text. Needless to say I was a wreck. 

So being a newly single 18 year old girl, I decided to see what casual sex is all about. I downloaded tinder and within a few days I decided to see what this 23 year old Zac Efron look alike was all about. We met up, hooked up a few times, but he was really immature and obnoxious so I stopped seeing like after a month. 

Fast forward 2 years. I joined the Reserves, and had just gotten back from training and it was my first day at my new command. I was in the new people room when GUESS WHO WALKS IN. I had no idea he joined the same branch and he had no clue either.

Instantly his eyes light up and he sits down right next to me and goes ""Heeeey!"" 

""Hi.""

""Long time, no see!"" 

""Yup."" 

""Sorry, what's your name again?"" 

(Jesus fucking christ, my name is on my uniform) ""It's imightbeaspider."" 

""Oh yeah Hahaha that's right, are you 21 yet?"" 

""No. I'm 20."" 

""JEEZ, THEN HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN WE WERE... you know, hahaha"" 

""I was 18."" (He's saying this in front of all of my new coworkers and I'm wanting to die.) 

""Damn, I'm a cradle robber aren't I? Hahahaha"" 

That. That is my biggest hookup regret. Luckily we were separated after that and I didn't have to be around him, but Holy shit was that embarassing. "
"The guy who took the condom off, stuck it back in and ejaculated inside me, even though I was screaming no. Also it was pretty much the first time I'd ever had sex. (First guy hardly counted because he only got half his dick in before he came.)  "
"I hate this one. The moment a women is sensual in any way, *especially in American movies*, you just know she's gonna cheat/stab the protagonist/be generally b*tchy. And the good girl is always demure, wears turtlenecks, is either vaguely boyish or inexperienced. 

It's like once you're a sexual person in your own right, and not to please some random dude, it suddenly speaks volume about your overall lack of morality. "
"I was very pro life when younger.  The child is innocent, after all.

I still believe the fetus is innocent, but after experiencing pregnancy myself and having it screw me up, I realize a woman's life is involved and how her life can be affected.

I am very much pro choice.  It makes me sad to hear about abortions because I do believe fetuses are people, but I understand that these are difficult choices made under hard circumstances and the mother should be the one to choose."
Growing up I had really crooked teeth and honestly wasn't great looking. Well I guess somewhere down the line I grew up to be pretty attractive and developed style but it took me SO long (honestly until recently) to re-wire my brain into accepting I'm not an ugly buck-toothed girl people would make fun of in elementary school. those kind of insecurities and memories can last for years. 
"I find that the laws of physics apply to my body (I mean, duh, but in a more noticeable way): a body in motion tends to stay in motion. I think that, the more you do, the more you want to do... Which is one reason why unemployment is so terrible, and why successful people seem to have about 30 hours in a day, but I digress.

When I'm at my healthiest/ thinnest/ most fit, my PMS is way, way, way, way more tolerable (less fatigue, fewer salty things consumed, more level-headed), but I find that if I work out, I'm all-around more productive - house is cleaner, I cook better, I fit chores into other chores (like laundry while I cook, that type of thing). Sitting around and watching Netflix in the evenings becomes a special treat, not the status quo, so I'm less jumbled on weekends when I have to do things. I keep my house much cleaner and am not embarrassed if someone drops by (it's never filthy, but I'm kind of obsessive).

"This one really hit home with me when I watched that movie/read the book. She hits the nail on the *fucking head* with it and it only makes it the all the more chilling when you realize that she really is very, very crazy and find yourself nodding along with her at points.

"Money, attractiveness, confidence, and networking are important to getting ahead in life.  I grew up poor and thought that simply being smart and working hard was good enough.  

Then I went to an elite college where I still didn't care about my appearance or socializing.  Now that I put more care into my appearance and make conscious social decisions, people seem to respect me and like me more.

Of course working hard and being intelligent matter a lot.  But combined with good social etiquette and a little makeup, you can make a better impression on the people you want to develop relationships with."
"When I was 16 my mom casually told me not to sleep with someone I have to see at school the next day in case they cry. Not me. Them.

Solid advice, mom!"
"If a woman isn't conventionally pretty or thin, she has to be there for physical comedy exclusively. Melissa McCarthy finally got to be sexy and smart in Spy, but only after role after role where she was mannish and flatulent.

If a woman in a comedy is too beautiful, she can only be relatable if she's a huge klutz. Most people are a little clumsy, so she has to fall down flights of stairs and throw paperwork everywhere so we consider her a ""real woman.""

If a 30-something woman doesn't have kids, it has to be a plot point. She's either frigid or barren. If she does have kids, every scene she's in is about her being a mom, because that's all she is now.

No woman's sexuality or relationship status is a side note. A character can't be smart, good at her job, fundamental to the plot, and also, oh yeah, she has a girlfriend at home. She is now Lesbian Character. Same with Single Straight Woman or any other combination of relationship status and sexuality. Their relation to the plot is secondary to their relation to the male protagonist's dick."

"He was a former co-worker and friend, and I was dating another guy, which he knew about.  But he wanted more, so he kept trying to monopolize my time.  I'd tell him, ""No, you know I'm dating so-and-so, plus I'd like to spend time with my other friends too, so I can't see you constantly.""  But he'd pepper me with questions like, ""Can I see you next weekend?  What about the weekend after that?  After that one?  The next one after that?""

I was creeped out enough that I started to put some distance between us.  Then the phone calls and hang-ups started, round the clock when he knew I'd be home.  I knew it was him from the caller ID, and he'd just keep calling over and over again.  I should also add that this wasn't just some young guy with a crush - this dude was about 42 at the time.

A couple of weeks into the phone calls, he just showed up at my apartment one Sunday morning, unannounced and uninvited.  He showed up early enough that he knew I probably wouldn't be showered, dressed and out the door yet.  He came early enough that he knew I would just be getting up so he could catch me. I should add that he didn't live very close to me. He had to take a commuter train from where he lived, and then a super long subway ride to my place, plus a 15 minute walk from the subway to my building.  He had to have gotten up at the crack of dawn to make sure he'd catch me that early. 

Once he got to my building, he waited till someone was going out and then he slipped in the front door and started knocking on the door of my apartment.  At that point, I realized this was no longer a guy friend with just a crush - I had a real creepy weirdo on my hands.

So I told him (*through the door, of course*) to leave now or I'd call the cops.  He wouldn't.  I told him again - he still wouldn't go.  Finally, on my third threat, I had to make good on it - I called the cops.  They showed up a few minutes later, and I can't even tell you how lucky I was.  I thankfully got a pair of police officers who put the fear of god into him.  One came in to talk to me and get my side of the story, while the other cop waited out in the hallway with him.

After a few minutes, they both came back and told me what happened.  They escorted him out of my building, and they told him, ""Look, you need to leave her alone.  She's not interested in you.  She never has been.  She's even dating another guy, *which you already know*.  So what that tells us is that we can get you on a stalking charge if we wanted to.""  Whether or not that was true, I'm not sure.

So they told him, ""Here's the deal.  We're going to call this 'trespassing', and let you go.  She has our direct number.  If you so much as even think about her again, we come to your home, arrest you, and upgrade you to 'stalking'.  You don't work with her anymore.  You live in two different towns.  You have no business that you need to take care of here.  So if we find out that you even entered this neighborhood again, or if you even so much as dial her number, we make good on the stalking charge.""

They scared him enough that I never heard from him again.  Professionally, this wasn't just some dirtbag guy - he had a good job, a nice home, and a lot to lose if he got arrested, so I think that snapped him out of it.

The cops were amazing.  I said, ""I was so scared, I wasn't sure you'd believe me.""  And they said, ""Never think that way.  Because you have to know - we've seen plenty of women hurt or killed because they figured the cops would think it was a 'he said/she said' scenario.  ALWAYS call if you're scared, that's our job."""

"he does a lot of great things but sometimes when we're talking I wish he would ask me more questions, like Ill ask him something and he'll go offer an hour answering the question but he doesn't always think, ""hey maybe HolidayBarbie would like to answer this question or talk about it too."" Don't get me wrong I love that he gets passionate about things but god sometimes I wish he would think a little bit about asking me questions. Something simple like when were taking about food and being asked what was your favorite meal ever? Literally, thats all I want sometimes. "

Kept texting me afterwards saying he doesn't need to do it in front of me, he found a kmart parking lot to do it in and he can come back. I blocked him. "

"Samantha Carter, from SG-1 was my girlhood hero. 

She was an Air Force Captain, has a Ph.D. in theoretical astrophysics and ""logged over 100 hours in enemy airspace"" during the Gulf War. 

She was a badass, and an amazing character, and I adore her. 

&gt;When I started Stargate, I got the part, I was SO thrilled to have this INCREDIBLE character, to be playing someone in the military. I had SO much respect, to be playing someone who’s so smart and so liberated and… I thought “Yes!”

&gt;I had two weeks to move from Toronto to Vancouver. I flew out there, I had my first wardrobe fitting. And one of the things that was in… THE thing that was in the wardrobe room was a very low-cut tank-top and a push-up bra…
And I turned to the costume designer - whom I’ve worked with since, who’s wonderful - and I said “What… What is this?” 

&gt;And she said “Well.. they wanna see what you look like in it.” 
And I said “…but this… NOBODY in the military, no captain in the US airforce would wear this… while her male counterparts are wearing crewneck t-shirts and… I c… I can’t do it!” 
And she said “Well, they just wanna see what you look like and take a picture and…” 
&gt;I was like “…”. 
&gt;And I PANICKED because I thought, I had just been given this AMAZING opportunity - I didn’t know it would last 10 years but I knew it was gonna be a kick-ass show - and I was like… “I can’t do it…”

&gt;And I started to cry and I said “You have to go upstairs and tell them I’m not doing it. And if it means that they recast the part then recast the part but you’ve cast a smart woman and you’ve cast somebody who has NEVER tried to get a job based on her looks or her body, I’ve always played strong, smart women, I… I can’t do it. So if they wanna recast the part I totally get it but I’m not playing THAT version of this character.”

&gt;But I’m saying this while I’m blubbering because I’m suffering that I’ve just lost maybe the best job of my career… 
And so she said “Okay” and I said “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’ve NEVER been difficult, I don’t… but I CAN’T do that!”
&gt;So she went upstairs and she came back down and she said “Okay, no problem.” 
&gt;And I said “Okay, so what’s my costume?” 
&gt;And she said “Well…” 
&gt;And I said “Just… What are the guys wearing?”
So she handed me a black T-Shirt and the BDUs, which is what my character would wear in the field with her male counterparts, and that’s where we went from there.

&gt;But that to me was the defining moment of… 
&gt;And I STILL cry about it because I still remember that young woman on the verge of breaking into the… new something big, being petrified that she was gonna loose it, but… I knew that I couldn’t play the TNA version of Sam Carter.

"Find things to appreciate. It's rare you are just living life and get that ""golden moment"" where everything is great. You have to look for things and people to be grateful for. Appreciating what you have is a skill and the more you practice it, the more you find it just happens. Some days it might just be something small like someone saying something funny or seeing someone hold the door for someone else. 

Check in with yourself from time to time - Are you happy? Is this what you want to be doing in life right now? No? What changes can you make then?

Understand that mental health is like physical health and you'll have your ups and downs with it. But just like physical health, it's something to take care of. If you see yourself getting unhappier and into a rut - reevaluate and put in safeguards from it getting too deep. 

Surround yourself with people that are good for you. Have a goal in your life and only surround yourself with people that will allow you to be the person you want to be to reach that goal.

Nope, you're getting looks from all the dudes - and some ladies as well. Classy dress for a wedding? Yeah only if it fits like a potato sack. Plus when I get older they are gonna droop like crazy.

"When I was little, I was chubby. I wanted a bikini and my mom told me bikinis were only for skinny girls. That stayed with me and she has no memory of it, which hurts. Now I'm grown, average height and pretty thin, and I still feel insecure as fuck in a bikini because of what she said. "

"I attended a strong high school but didn't always get great grades. Got decent SAT and SAT II scores (not amazing, but not poor), and took several AP classes. Still, somehow my parents had me CONVINCED that with my ""awful"" grades (~3.2 GPA, 3.8 weighted) I wasn't going to get into any school worth going to. I am Asian, and my parents had this expectation that if I didn't have a 4.0 or better I was basically nothing.

I cast a really wide net, shooting off applications to something like 40+ schools in the hopes that one of them would accept me.

When I got my first acceptance letter my mother burst into my room practically in tears because I was going to go to college.

...then the dozens of other acceptances started pouring in (even from universities I considered were dream schools and totally out of reach) and I realized maybe, just maybe, my parents were full of shit.

I still wonder what kind of awesome university I could've attended if I had set my sights a little higher."

In fact, when economies collapsed Jews were often blamed. It's a very old point of view.

"I wish my boyfriend was better at cooking. Like, he is always willing to go and try, but it's just too dangerous leaving that boy unsupervised in a kitchen. 

Like the other day he was trying to make eggs for dinner. As they were on the stove, he stood at the door and started chatting with me about something. Once I smelled something vaguely like a tire fire, I asked him if the eggs were still cooking. 

He just gave me a blank look for a second and then went ""Oh, yeah the eggs are...........*oh shit!*!"" 

We had to order Chinese.

He is perfectly wonderful in very other way, I just can't afford to let him cook by himself, and I really wish I could sometimes."
"I look for the evidence. I struggle with relationship anxiety sometimes. The evidence always proves me wrong when I'm wrong. If I think my SO isn't as invested in the relationship for whatever crazy reason I have at the time, I think back on all the reasons he is. He talks to me, he cares about my feelings and what I want, he did this thing for me, he's been very thoughtful about this issue, etc. If I talk to him about my concerns, he listens and we have a reasonable discussion.

When there actually IS a problem, as I ran into with my ex, the evidence shows it. Issues don't get discussed or resolved. He doesn't do things that show he's invested. He does things that show he doesn't actually care, acts very selfishly, etc. And with my ex, if I tried to discuss these issues he would just blow up on me about it. It did take me a lot longer than it should have to trust my gut on that relationship because I feared it was all my anxiety. I've learned to pay more attention to the evidence from now on. "

I have a host of other body insecurities but I can't imagine letting a guy get too close to my vagina because he would see the scars/discoloration.

"Omg this. So frustrating.... Just seems like a manipulative trick to get women to act a certain way. Every person is different, why do we have to be the same ""cool"" girl to be liked?

"So i met this guy on tinder. He was really cute and we texted for a few days. One night i went out, got VERY drunk and decided I wanted to hook up. 

So i text the guy at 5 a.m on a Saturday saying something like ""wanna come play chess?"" after he knew i was going out. It was the first time I was seeing him in person and I know it was reckless, but I was very very drunk and thought it was a good idea.

The guy comes in and we instantly start to make out and I start to direct him to my bed (I live in a small apartment, so the bed is not far from the door). 

Everything is going as planned in my drunk head UNTIL he sees the chess game on my library... He grabs the box all excited, goes to my table and starts to prepare the game. I'm dumbfounded. But you know, I'm drunk, so i go like ""fuck it"", get some coffee ready and start playing chess. 

 Needless to say, he absolutely destroyed me. 

 But it wasn't over yet. He wanted to play AGAIN. By this point I'm not even that drunk anymore, so I didn't even know how to handle the situation and started to realize what a bad idea this thing was. Let's add to this that during all this time he was talking about this girl he had seen ONCE over six months ago. And he was very very socially awkward. Well, more like socially inept. But handsome, very handsome. 

 So we are at the middle of the second game when i get fed up with the whole situation and decide I am having sex or he is leaving. This time I manage to distract him from the game and we go to the bed and everything is back on track. But things keep getting worse as I wasn't expecting was this guy to be HUGE. He had the biggest thing i had seen. Even in porn. I can't even call that thing a dick. I was terrorized and also quite mad at the whole situation. Needless to say it was anatomically impossible to have sex. 

 At this point i'm more than convinced that I want this guy to leave and never see him again. And, good thing, he is leaving. 

 I should have mentioned before that this guy is aprox 1,95 mts and i'm only 1,57 mts. 

 When I'm saying good bye to him he makes some joke about my height and I make the horrible mistake of saying ""yeah, my friends used to call me Juli from the shire"". Now, i'm not a huge fan of lotr and my friends aren't either, but this guy was. he got SO excited about me saying that and he just came back in and started talking about the books and the movies and the Silmarillion. He talked to me about all this for maybe about an hour and half. 

 Eventually I kicked him out. It was around 10 am in the morning by the time he left. And we didn't have sex.

 PS. Yes, this was all the same guy, and after all this he kept texting me for year and half (I kept blocking him).

 PSS. I don't do tinder anymore."

"I call it ""Neapolitan Ice Cream"". I am not saying it's objectively bad or even by any means sexist, but it's so over done and clichéd. "
"So, one of my biggest female idols growing up was Dr. Sattler from Jurassic Park. You know... ""Dinosaur eats man... woman inherits the Earth."" There were some small hints that she wanted children in the movie, but nothing overt or even that noticeable within a first, casual viewing (but I've seen that movie about 200 times, probably). She was strong and tenacious, she lived in a crappy trailer in the desert digging up T Rex bones... I mean she was my freaking hero in every sense of the word. 

In the third film, they bring Dr. Grant and Dr. Sattler back and I was so stoked! 

Well guess what? She found a man (not Dr. Grant and not a paleontologist) who would give her babies and was a SAHM at the opening of that movie. With a huge house. I shut it off before that opening scene could even end I was so mad/upset. What did they do to my Dr. Sattler! :("

"It's not about what I ""allow"" them to do or not to do. I simply don't want to be in a relationship where we sleep with other people, and I only want to date people who feel the same way. My partner and I agree on this, and if he changed his mind, the relationship might not last even if he agreed to stay monogamous.

"I don't get why everyone is so pissed she didn't go to a march. Maybe she had other shit to do that day. Maybe she had the flu. Did anyone ask her why she didn't go, or did everyone just go HUUHHH BUUHHHH TSWIFT UR A BAD FEMINIST. I didn't go to a march either but I don't think that makes me any less feminist.

"They absolutely have the right to protest and March and speak. 

As far as the details go, I couldn't possibly disagree with them more, and I think the Pro Life movement has gone off the (already objectionable) tracks completely. They are only pro-birth, their rhetoric is violent and their tactics are underhanded, and they are responsible both for direct violence (clinic shootings) and indirect violence (women unable to have access to safe, affordable contraception and abortions.) I think it is scary as FUCK to see our deranged Vice President up there promising to overturn Roe v Wade and I deeply, deeply believe that this administration will be responsible for the death of women on a global scale, and for a widespread loss of health and financial prosperity.

"I woke up, groaned, and slapped the alarm. 

Fuck mornings. 

I slid off my bed, laying slumped on the floor until the next round of beeps prompted me to stumble upright and shuffle toward the closet. I ignored the mirror for the most part, but noted I ought to clean it - the dust bunnies were starting to built a tiny colony. 

I slid my arms into whatever shirt I grabbed, shimmying into yesterday's jeans with the knowledge that no one at work would notice. 

I then took off the shirt again, cursed my stupid life, shrugged on a sports bra, and pulled the shirt back on. 

Already hating the world, I shoved my phone into my back pocket, hobbling awkwardly as I tried to tuck in my shirt and fasten my belt at the same time. 

and so the day started. "
"I come from a majority Catholic country and moved to California. It's fucking amazing here. Less shame about sex, more freedom, it's safer, etc. Even my tiger parents loosened up when they got here.

I guess the biggest challenge for me was adapting to the lack of social support system here. Back home, I had a close-knit group of family/friends, some of whom had considerable influence. Here in the US, not so. But that just means I know that here I stand on my merits, not because some relative of mine knew someone who got me into something."

"My last FWB. The guy simply had almost zero stamina. First BJ I gave him went like this: thup thup thup thup thup thup....squirt. Just that fast (I used thup because I don't know how to type a sucking noise heh).

Well it was our first time together, so I figured he had stage fright. He recovered and we went to PIV. Shag shag shag shag shag....squirt. Just about that fast.

This happened a few more times, and I eventually scored an orgasm. Keep in mind that I am really easy to give an orgasm to, but he couldn't muster that on a regular basis. TWO MINUTES is all it took usually for me, and he'd jizz out long before that. I finally got tired of it and told him to buzz off.

Another bad one was the first guy I met when I moved here. He was divorced, and complained that his ex wasn't ever passionate. Sooo anyway, I was giving him this nice BJ. I'm pretty good at them, and never had a guy be totally silent the whole time...but this guy was. Not a single moan or peep or *anything*. And when he came, not a single indication that he enjoyed a single moment of it. And then sex was the same thing. No noises or anything at all. As I said, I am super easy to give an orgasm to, but after a few minutes, I tuned out and wanted it done. Mr Passionate was about as much fun as fucking a mannequin. I never called him back...at least my vibrator makes funny noises and doesn't come in my mouth. "

"I don't know why it took reading this post to realize it, but it did. At the end of the day, does any governing body have the right to tell a woman, or anybody, what they can or can't do with their body? I've always been sort of on the fence about pro-life and pro-choice because I do believe women should have rights over their own body, but at the same time realize that while a fetus may not actually be fully alive, abortion is preventing life. However, realizing that at the end of the day you can't force a woman to have a child. It's her body, her pain, her life on the line, and even forcing her to have a baby and putting it up for adoption is still wrong because that woman may not want progeny in the world and to force it on her would be psychologically cruel to know that she has an unwanted child out there somewhere. If all that fails, I simply think would I want the government telling me how I could use my body? No! Far too invasive of my privacy and as a fully functioning adult a woman's wishes have priority over an unformed fetus. "

"And they talk about how some chemical or something must have been given to them to keep it from growing back in. It's something she notices, during the games."
"Also, the woman's rights movements and feminism can be intimidating for women who prefer a traditional, more conservative lifestyle/life script. They eventually feel attacked or judged if they aren't the working, academia role model or devalued for being a simple SAHM who likes her church and potlucks, just like men may feel devalued if their wife earns more than them. 

But there are countless reasons. Topics like job loss are not affecting males only, women can be against immigration as well and so forth. A lot of people vote just for a single topic they care about, without care for the broader picture."
"I know many of you know this and I might've missed it in the comments, but a midwife might be able to help as well.

"To be fair, that's just a filming thing. If they actually ate the food, they would have to eat it 50 times to get the right shots/takes, and it would slow down the scene. There aren't a lot of breaks in dialogue in that show, so there's less time for actual eating. "
I've done it before but it isn't one of my favourite things - I always worry about being too heavy or smothering my partner to death or something.
"A little late to this conversation, but for me it's the 'crazy bitch' trope. Women are portrayed as conniving, manipulative, and motivated primarily to get men's money/attention etc. They speak with shrill, whiney, bossy, angry, or child-like voices and sabotage the lives of those around them. The show Two and a Half Men is an extreme example of this but there are many more. "
"And that's if you get a healthy one. If you have one with significant disabilities, there goes the rest of your life. Oh, and all of your money. 

Props for people who choose that life but holy crap can it be bad. I know a woman who has triplets and all have profound autism. She's a wreck. And so is her house from all the mega tantrums.

"Not a female trope, but one of my movie pet peeves is when the characters that hate each other are the ones that end up getting together. "
Win the lottery.
"I think most women assume other women aren't as hairy as them, but in reality we're all pretty hairy and just don't talk about it. Some stuff like leg and armpit shaving is socially acceptable to acknowledge but I'd bet the majority of us are removing facial hair too. Like, I could grow a legit teenage boy level mustache and sideburns and unibrow."
"So MPDG is a term to describe those female characters who are quirky and bubbly and have no character substance whatsoever. They exist pretty much entirely as some sort of mystery and love-interest for the male protagonist. 

Think of pretty much any John Green book. Mysterious girl who has a lot of weird tendencies and disappears, so the obsessed teenage boy becomes adventurous and appreciates life more as a result. "
If I have to see Michelle Rodriguez play that character one more time......
"My mom was definitely not the most stable when I was a kid. She'd have a bad day at work, or a mood swing, and make up the most ridiculous scenarios in her head and beat my brother and I senseless over these scenarios that never fucking happened. 

I remember getting between her and my brother as she was beating him with a hard-soled shoe. I woke up in the floor, alone, and it hurt to move much for a couple of days. Apparently there were bruises all over me? I don't remember. I was seven. That night was the only time I ever saw my parents fight. My dad was yelling at her and she was sitting on the couch expressionless. They made us go to another room but that didn't do much. 

I learned to predict when she'd take her temper out on us -- pretty much whenever things didn't go smoothly. Car trouble, asshole coworkers, heat stress, you name it. The day her car overheated in the summer of 1996, I had my first panic attack. I was five or six. 

I am 27 years old and still fucking flinch and panic and dissociate a little when things go wrong for people in my vicinity because a tiny part of me knows I'll be the one blamed for it. My boyfriend has been patient with this, and recognizes that I'm used to frustration or anger at a situation being taken out on me just because I'm there. I panicked the other night over car problems and sat in the driver's seat completely frozen waiting for him to scream at or grab me. 

It's fucked up. "
It was pretty crazy. He told me he tore some of his foreskin while having sex with some other girl. He wasn't circumcized and had a tight foreskin so. I guess he just went through some sort of a circumcision while having sex with someone else. I didn't really want to know but in his defence he felt very bad. 
"There is a website called the Labia Library which might be a good place to take a look at because there are pictures and lots of facts about labia.

Specifically here: http://www.labialibrary.org.au/your-labia/are-my-labia-normal/ there is actually a sub topic called ""Someone said something about your labia"" which might help you.

You were judged by someone unfairly, who probably has his standards of what a labia is from the porn industry. Labia aren't cookie cutter, and different shapes/sizes are nothing to be ashamed of.

Not knowing you, but from your comments, it seems like this person you were with really hurt you. Can I suggest that you talk to someone about it, a therapist or even when you go to your gyno appointment? 

It's your body, and you need to do what is right for you, so no judgement but one person (one jerk!) made a horrible comment that has affected you greatly and I think that might be the real issue here.

xo!

Eventually I stop and have a serious conversation about boundaries, and how not only is a condom for my safety, but his too.

I don't have to pretend like I'm living in Pleasantville. And everyone around me is the same. 

I was the ""black sheep"" of the family growing up but I'm a regular adult in California now.

The one downside is that my family run the household like it's still USSR and we're back home. 

I was finally able to move out, in my late 20s, and live with my SO. That is frowned upon and ""good girls"" don't live together before marriage. Was a fun talk with my family when they found out I wasn't a virgin anymore. 

I'm enjoying being an independent woman living here. If I was still back home I'd be married off with kids by 22. Why? Because everyone else is doing that, you obviously do that too! Was why my mother got married to my father and had me even though neither was ready to get married or have kids.

My family calls me an ""old maid"" because I'm still not married and I'm in my late 20s. Even though I have a loving SO who I've been with for many years. 

They also refuse to even fathom the idea that I don't want to have children. Ever. They think it's a phase and that maternal instinct didn't wake up yet and one day it will. But at the same time ""the biological clock is ticking"" and I couldn't care less. 

So to answer your question, I'm enjoying my independence and freedom to be who I want to be without having this little box I have to fit into hovering above my head. "

"I was briefly stalked (harassed is probably a better word)by a classmate I worked with on a 4 person group project. I shared my E mail/social media info with him (and everybody else in the group) so that he could contact me if need be. He was totally fine and normal as far as I know during the duration of the project, which was a couple weeks. But after the project was done, he sent me a message asking if I wanted to study with him sometime. I told him I would be open to that and recommended the library but he kept trying to get me to come to his apartment. I kept gently insisting that I would prefer the library but he wasn't taking the hint so eventually, I had to be totally honest and tell him that I just wasn't comfortable with the idea of studying together in a non-public place since I didn't know him that well.

He never responded after that. 

The following semester, I started bumping into him everywhere outside of class. Grocery store, Laundromat, bars...everywhere. Even my friends noticed. He would usually come up and say hi and seemed normal enough but I was running into him DAILY. That's when I began to feel like I was being stalked for sure.

After a few weeks of that he messaged me again asking if I wanted to get dinner and do laundry at the Laundromat together. Easily the weirdest idea for a date that I had ever heard. I nicely told him that I was not interested.

Again, he never responded. 

Two days later I was leaving my apartment and noticed a car in the parking lot that wasn't usually there (there were only 3 other tenants in my building so I knew what they drove) and it sped away super fast and I was about 99.9% it was him behind the wheel. 

The next day he messaged me again and specifically mentioned that he was out of town the previous day when I didn't even ask or say anything at all that would prompt him to say that. He then proceeded to shower me with compliments about how nice, funny, smart, and pretty I am. I thanked him for the kind words and then he immediately offered me another date. Dinner and a movie. I told him that I am not interested and that I don't see any way that the two of us would ever date. He started getting real upset and demanded to know why. I finally was completely honest with him and mentioned that I was feeling really weirded out by him and how frequently he always seemed to be where I was. He kept insisting he wasn't following me and told me I was being crazy before asking me out...AGAIN! He literally just called me crazy so now I was pissed and told him to fuck off. He replied by calling me ""giant-titted cunt"" before blocking and unfriending me, which of course I was going to do to him anyways.   

Never heard from him again after that. 

Oh, and I messaged the other girl in the group project after he unfriended me and she said that he asked her out too. He apparently called her a fat bitch when she declined his offer though. She reported him to the university and that was the end of it though. I reported him shortly after as well and I am not sure what eventually came of it on his end but he never contacted me again.

"Floral skater dresses with combat boots. I really liked the combination of feminine and badass that was common in the 90s. Also, clothes that look lived-in, like shabby flannel and jeans with holes in the knees. It was kinda nice that my tendency to wear thrift store clothes and continue fixing them with duct tape and safety pins until they were too worn out to be functional was fashionable in the grunge/punk crowd. "
"Find someone willing to go to bat for me that works at a pharmacy or knows someone who works at a pharmacy. Have them get me a bunch of methotrexate. Take half orally and insert half vaginally. You will abort if you are early enough along. Source? Me, getting pregnant while studying abroad in a developing country that didn't have legal abortion access. "
"Looks terrible? If there was someone in the audience who objected that much to unshaven legs, would they even be able to see it?"
"Uh, not all men butts..."
Laser hair removal on my legs... the gift of thousands of future hours and confidence points
If someone thinks they are unique as in literally the only person who sees the truth about the world and society...or that you are the only one who knows the truth about the universe...or both of you together are the only woke people in the world and everyone else and other institutions are all sheep.  That's a very bad sign.  
"I had a warehouse job for a long time. This warehouse didn't have air conditioning for a while. 

Someone from HR told me I couldn't wear racerback tank tops (even with the appropriate bra) because ""shoulder blades are considered erogenous zones"". But... There were dudes walking around with the sides cut out of their shirts and I saw more man nipples at work than on the beach? Lol no. 

So I kept with my racerback tops and never heard anything about it again. 

It didn't really affect me so much as piss me off. "
"You absolutely shouldn't be handling &gt;50% of the housework yourself if you're both working full time. That's incredibly unfair, you're not his mom or slave. And don't worry about the nagging, there's nothing wrong with telling an adult to adult.

"I noticed this a lot rewatching Seinfeld recently. Every woman Jerry (and George!) dates is a young beautiful woman, and Elaine dated a lot of older and not very attractive men."
Spreadsheet? What kind of data do you track?
"I would want to be physically and mentally healthy. No more hypothyroidism and other mysterious physical issues. No more anxiety, depression, ADHD. I want so so much to be in perfect health. Or even just adequate. Enough to be on par with the majority of people, all those functional people."
"No guy is worth killing yourself over. And if he is, he won't ever put you through that. "
"Yesterday some guy on Xbox live asked me if I hung around with a lot of men because some phrases I used were masculine (admittedly I did say ""suck my dick"" at one point) and that he figured the men rubbed off on me and shaped my personality. 

Ok xXx420halodemon69xXx thanks for the armchair psychology. How about I'm just my own person and not defined by men?"
"From my own relationship, I would suggest stuff like little snacks/treats without having to be asked specifically to pick it up, or maybe some flowers or something equivalent. Sometimes when I go to the store, I'll grab a bottle of Mexican coca-cola because my SO loves it, and surprise him with it in the fridge. 

It's a sign of ""hey, I know you like this thing and I was thinking about you so I wanted to show you that I listen to you and want to brighten your day""."
"My first one night stand. I met him at a club, thought he was hot (I may have been drinking) but he told me he lived with his teenage girlfriend but that they were broken up. He was 21, she was 17. (I know, I know. Red flag!) 

Anyway I take him home and we hook up and when he comes he ROARS like some kind of bear or lion or something. That was pretty wtf. It wouldn't have been so bad but I had three male housemates at the time and they found it absolutely hilarious. They roared at me every time I walked in the door for at least a year, and then explained the joke to everyone we knew. HA. 

But the worst part is that several days later, his 17 year old girlfriend shows up at my house, screaming and pounding on the door. I opened it because you know, neighbors and such. She was very, very obviously pregnant. And apparently they were absolutely NOT on a break. I felt bad but really, how the fuck was I supposed to know? This was way before social media (unless you count LiveJournal) Sadly I never ran into him again, because there were a lot of words I wanted to say to him for being such a scumbag. "
Women handle rejection much better.
A MENTAL SWITCH TO TURN ON AND OFF WHEN I WANT MY UTERUS TO DO STUFF BECAUSE FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE SO FAR I HAVE NOT WANTED IT TO DO STUFF BUT IT'S JUST TRUCKIN ALONG NOT GIVING A SINGLE OUNCE OF A FUCK HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS 
"I'm 5'3"" I feel your pain :( I'm starting to suspect some guys with big dicks don't think they need to put much effort into actually being good? IDK"
"I work in a school that's partly boarding so some staff live on site. The headmaster's dog can often be seen trotting at his heels and his cat roams all over the grounds, sometimes jumping in through windows. The cat often hangs out at reception and has often calmed down a grumpy parent by purring at them. There's a beagle on site too, and a huge orange cat. Someone brought in their ponies and goats on a special occasion:

There's probably going to be a pet blessing ceremony in the school chapel or on the quad outside (which would probably be a more sensible option!!) and staff and students are invited to bring along their pets for that. I might take my cat because I think he's possessed:

We sometimes get visits from therapy dogs too because we raise money for their charity and some students help socialise the dogs. "
They will like you even more if you remember the answers to the questions
[Givewell](http://www.givewell.org/) is a highly respected organization that tirelessly researches and analyzes existing charities so you know where you will get the most bang for your buck.
Same. Bringing me a nice beer or a snack or a small gift just because he was thinking of me would be nice. 
Don't expect to be happy every day. 
"I mean... it was in the books. Specifically about how ridiculous it was that Capitol people couldn't abide seeing hair on women's legs. As in, blatantly lampooning the problem. So. Yeah. That's kind of the point. Did you think they made it up for the movies?"
Neither will Trump
"Roe V Wade has been an enormous boon in reducing violent crime and urban decay across the nation. Turns out that women and couples planning when they want children leads to more stable families, and a more stable society in general."
"The way Madonna acted at the women's march pissed me off, because I feel she was using it as an opportunity to generate publicity for herself rather than support feminism.

Also, Richard Dawkins. I used to appreciate his snark,  but I think his commentary on Islam stinks of white male privilege. On top of that elevator gate. I'm sorry, but you don't get to be ""women who aren't forced to wear burkas and are allowed to drive should just shut up because that means they don't face misogyny lol."" "
First name (there's one I don't know) and either last name or descriptor. Month and year we first hooked up. That's it.
"Well unless they are also chronically ill I don't think other women deal with feeling like a burden to those they love because of their shitty health.

Like my body regularly freaks out and tries to eat itself, and if I don't keep it in check will cripple me.  It's hard to deal with that looming over your head."
