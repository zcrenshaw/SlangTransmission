"We had wanted a kitten for years, and my dad always said no way. We went out and got one,  dirtied it up, and left it out by my dad's shop. It was cold out, and when he came in for dinner he was packing this filthy little kitten. He didn't want it to freeze so he let us keep it inside until we could find it a new home, needless to say he fell in love with it. All us kids moved out, and my dad still babied that cat, it lived for twenty-something years."
"My mother and I once stopped by my dad's favourite cupcake shop, but they only had two left.

We ate them and never mentioned it."
"I didn't expect him to be a dom. He's shy, inexperienced, a little bit awkward, and permanently worried he's going to upset me somehow. He's also the kindest, gentlest, most loving guy I've ever met - doesn't have a bad bone in his body. Except in bed, when he suddenly becomes demanding and controlling and rough and it's INCREDIBLE. He's like an entirely different person.

I think the contrast is what makes him such a good dom, though. I know that if anything goes wrong he'll immediately turn back in to his normal caring self and get me out straight away, with plenty of love and apologies, and that makes me feel very safe around him. I trust him a LOT. Plus his aftercare is incredible! It's a really great combo."
Sometimes after we finish he will press his forehead against mine for a moment. I don't know why but it melts my heart.
Bluntness. So many people use it as an excuse to be an asshole. 
"When my dad was away on a business trip, my mom accidentally left our laundry room tap on and the sink overflowed and flooded our downstairs.

We told him it was our old washing machine that went and the ""repair guy"" told her she needed a new one.

So after getting new carpets and other restorations, my mother got the front loading washer she'd been wanting for years, my dad was none the wiser, and my twin and I never had to hear him have a meltdown moan about it for months (he never lets mistakes like that go. Ever.)

It's been over 15 years. He still thinks the old washer broke.

"
"My mom bought me some slightly sexy bra and underwear sets  in 9th or 10th grade on a shopping trip. She said that when you wear pretty underwear you just feel more confident. I don't *think* she meant in a sexual way. Just a base level pretty matching layer helps you feel more pulled together. 

15 years later and it's still an easy go-to confidence booster. "
Over use of sarcasm. It's like herbs for cooking. A little sarcasm can spice things up but a whole meal of it is bitter and unpalatable.
"Tanning beds or spray tans.

I don't like tanning because I don't want wrinkles and the idea of coating my body in a fake tan sounds ridiculous to me. "
The conversation I had with my teenage daughter regarding the fact that if she has sexual needs she should learn to satisfy herself because she will get no satisfaction from any boy she meets until she's quite a bit older. She tells me that nothing I can say will ever shock her after that.
"African water buffalo vote.  When they've eaten all the grass in an area, they'll sit and look in the direction they think the herd should take.  All of the buffalo get a vote and every vote is equal - there's a lead buffalo but she doesn't get a final say or anything.  Any of the buffalo can propose a direction regardless of status.  

After about an hour, the herd will go in the direction that got the most votes.  If there's a tie between two directions, the herd will split up and then meet back up later."
"Probably that anything cute or romantic is assumed to be what the girl wants, not the guy. Plus the whole whenever the guy does something for the girl it means he's whipped thing. Just no."
"It didn't really go well.

Like the event was fun. The aftermath though, not so much. 

It happened with a friend of mine (For sake of story telling my friend we'll call Jane, myself will be Lucy and my boyfriend will be Dan), we didn't talk about it before she just came over one night and it happened.

Jane would come over on Thursdays some nights when she was on the early shift (not every Thursday just every now and then). After the threesome Dan and my sex life plummeted it felt like he wouldn't have sex unless it was after a Thursday just incase Jane came round and it happened again. 

During the event itself Dan tried a position with Jane that he's never done with me. When I spoke to him about it he just shrugged and said it wouldn't work with us because I'm bigger than she was. Ouch. That still hurts to think about. 

Dan has never been a ""round 2"" kind of guy. But he absolutely was this time. During ""Round 2"" I was very much ignored. 

All of the above caused a lot of hurt and resentment which took a lot of work from both us to work through. 

So the event itself was fun but I got jealous, hurt and resentful over it so I don't think I'd do it again.

Also Jane distanced herself after that. She stopped coming over and replying to texts. We still have each other on facebook and are polite when we bump into each other but that's about it so I lost a good friend out of it. "
"My dad thinks my middle name is Mary Marie but my mom thought that was dumb because it's literally ""Mary Mary"" so instead my mom put Mary Helen on my birth certificate and my dad has no idea. Edit: clarity"
"I actually dislike cuddling after (I'm sweaty, gross and he goes off inside me so I want to clean up) so he lies there and as I go to get up, he'll say ""Good game!"" or something similar and slap my butt. It never fails to make me laugh. "
"Cuddle me!  I deeply enjoy when he takes the time to hold me afterwards or pet my hair.  He doesn't do it often (he says he gets a rush of energy after sex so he wants to get up and go do things), but the times he does makes sex and our relationship feel so much more amazing."
"Cheating in Sex and the City. They act like ""everyone does it and it's ok."""
"Free-spirited. So many people who I've met describe themselves as a free-spirit just because they like to travel or think being a hippie is cool. Often they're actually really dramatic or anxious individuals. Most of the true free-spirits I know are super flakey and inconsistent. I love them, but they're just not reliable."
Lack of feedback.  I will feel like I did well writing a letter or in a job interview and just never hear back.  What did I do wrong?  Was it even something I did wrong?  Am I stumbling about repeatedly doing something dumb and I'll never know what specifically without random guessing?
"He's really turned on by muscle structure. Calves, biceps, muscular thighs, or defined abs. In bed he loves to be squeezed between my thighs.  

It makes me feel pretty sexy and powerful, though I know it seems probably odd as hell. The way I see it, any man can be an ""ass man"" or a ""tit man"" but I've never been with someone who finds the lines of my calves or the muscles along my ribs or back irresistible. I'm not in like. Super body builder shape, I run mostly, but it's nice being desired for something  I do work to improve rather than things I merely inherited. "
"We writhe around a lot, sometimes my hair get super tangled as a result. (I have uncontrollable curly hair) He will sit behind me with a brush and brush out the tangles in hair until it's tangle free :) "

Feminism. Like that's a bad thing.
"Apples exhibit extreme heterozygosity.  An apple tree doesn't exhibit the qualities of its ""parents.""  If you pollinate a Red Delicious tree with the pollen from another Red Delicious tree, the seed won't produce a Red Delicious tree.  The resulting fruit might be red or green or purple, sweet or sour or bitter, there's no way to tell.  

Apples were originally primarily made into cider or fed to livestock.  Every now and then, someone would find an apple tree that produced tasty apples, and it would be guarded carefully and sold to a company.  The Botany of Desire likened finding tasty apples to finding an oil well on your property.  

So instead of growing apple trees from seed, branches from the tasty apple tree are grafted onto other apple trees, which is how they're mass produced.  The Red Delicious apple you eat was produced on a clone of a tree found in Iowa in 1880."
"Basically every time I hear people around me speaking in lowered tones, I assume they're saying all kinds of shit about me. Which is INSANE because I am the most boring person possibly ever, at least to people I don't know super well, and there wouldn't even be enough words to say about me to fill a conversation. And yet... 

It's a tough one to overcome, since it seems to spring simultaneously from a place of insecurity *and* a place of narcissism so there isn't a solid plan of attack. "
"Anyone remember that movie 40 days and 40 nights? At the end that blonde chick rapes him. There are no two ways about this. She walks into his place before the time is up, jumps on his bed while he's asleep, and rapes him. And somehow this is his fault, and the girlfriend gets mad and runs away in tears, and it's never addressed at all. I was fucking appalled."
I came home stoned and we split a pot of spaghetti and ate chocolate frosting for dessert. 
I usually get really giggly after sex and he's really funny (and a voice actor) so sometimes he'll launch into what's essentially a stand up comedy routine complete with characters and silly voices to make me laugh.

When one girl in the group started edging me out of the group and none of them did anything to stop it even though they all admitted that it was happening. I eventually burned that bridge and found better friends.
"I think the concepts of ""the one"" and jealousy lead to isolating, co-dependent and even abusive relationships. Your partner should add to your life, not limit or control it."
"For me, it's when there's no indication of salary...like WHY? I NEED TO KNOW!"
"Don't just be out there looking to get A GIRLFRIEND. Look to make a connection with another human being. Treat women as people, not as another species. "
The fact that he doesn't have any was most surprising. 
"This was years ago. Like just out of HS. But when my best friend tried to get me raped and the others ""didn't want to take sides"" and ""I was as overreacting"" 

They all got the boot.  "
"Something every NiceGuy needs to realise - being nice. Being nice should be a basic trait, a fundamental aspect of being able to befriend other people. It is not this all encompassing level of Good that entitles you to whatever you want from a person."
"I do think there's a nature component to it - some people have an eye for systems and order. And while it can be taught, there's also a lot of wisdom in going with your aptitudes and finding a system that you can realistically maintain.

Anyway, I'm organized like whoa. (do people still say that?). My wardrobe and meals for the next 2 weeks is planned, I can tell you where/ when I bought anything in my house, as well as fetch anything at all because it's in its place or I know where it is. 

**DAILY** My rule is twofold: 1- handle things as little as possible, and 2- if it needs doing, do it now. If I'm cooking, I put a load of laundry in while things simmer. I fold towels while I chat with my sister. I put my shoes away the minute I'm back from my walk. I deal with mail right as I get it. I write down when I bought things like coffee and bread flour so I know how long things last, and replace them before I run out. I meal plan and mealprep each week. Every day, I do *something.* Whether that's a single chore or I go on a cleaning binge, just... something. Even taking the little trash cans out before a shower makes your house feel better. Very few ""0-days."" It's so much easier to clean 1 thing daily than 15 things monthly - this goes for laundry and cooking and wiping and surfaces. 

**CLUTTER.** People, IME, are very ""clutter-blind."" Take a photo of your surfaces and see what's piled up. Mail, laundry, shoes, scarves, all these things make for a disorganized living space, and ""picking up"" can make cleaning feel impossible. 

**STUFF.** I'm lucky in that I am, like, the opposite of a hoarder. But the amount of ""stuff"" that people keep is really what makes a house messy over time. I do the KonMari method (and have 0 problem getting rid of stuff). I truly believe in the psychological components of clutter - if your kitchen is messy, you can't nourish yourself, if your bathroom is messy, you can't present your best self through primping. If that type of thinking works for you, look into it and it could help declutter and get rid of stuff you won't/ shouldn't use, like old makeup or clothes that don't fit. 

**BOUNDARIES.** ""Tidy spaces harbor tidy minds."" I make my bed each day, don't let people that aren't my husband into my bedroom (including pets, but that's really another topic), don't feel compelled to open the door to salespeople/ canvasers, don't use my phone if my husband and I are eating dinner, I eat off real plates so I don't devolve into a bachelor that shovels food down over the sink. I work from home, so every day, I put my headphones away in their spot, log out of my email, push in my chair, and don't look at my work login until the next day, or Monday if it's a weekend. It's too easy to blur the lines between ""home"" and ""work"" and keeping that separate is priority to me. What are your boundaries? Don't let people make you think that you're ""lazy"" for taking a self-care day, or talk you into going out if you need downtime - honor your boundaries in your home. 

**ROUTINE.** Because I work from home, this matters a LOT to me. I exercise every morning, shower while coffee brews, log into work at the same time. Always, always shower and get ready for work as though I'm going in - it really does help with productivity. This is a *bit* more flexible on the weekends, but I still think it's good for your sleep and headspace and bowel movements and health and diet to keep a routine. 

**CLEANING.** I started at unfuckyourhabitat as a guideline on what should be done, and when. Daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal, yearly chores - what are they? Well, daily is stuff like mail, dishes, eating, showering. Weekly is stuff like surfaces, laundry, vacuuming. Monthly is stuff like a deep-clean, windows, cars. Seasonal is blinds, corners, cleaning pantry/fridge, yard turnover. Yearly is more clutter and purging. These are guidelines, but are my rough timetable - flexible if, say, you enjoy gardening and want to do it weekly or something. But part of keeping a clean home is keeping up with it. I do dishes every day - it makes breakfast feel better if I walk into a clean kitchen. I make my own cleaning supplies (can link or describe if you have made it this far in this long-ass reply). Sometimes, I go on binges and clean a LOT one weekend, and sometimes I don't do much cleaning - the nice thing about an overall system is that you can afford to skip a day if you're tired or need a break. Do I get lazy and leave shit out, and opt to watch 'Malcolm in the Middle' all day on random rainy Sundays? Of course. But the difference is that my shoes won't just live there, I'll deal with them soon. ALSO, as far as cleaning goes, don't work twice. Learn the proper order to clean stuff in (like, clutter, surfaces, appliances floors; cleaning the floor when you're about to dust isn't productive. I can expand on that if there is interest)

In sum, I lived with a gal for awhile who is not organized and let literal and figurative ""stuff"" pile up in her life. Seeing how much of a toll that took on her life (like not being able to find stuff or buying things twice), as well as my home, has given me a new energy to keep cleaning and take pride in my house and my space. Being clean and organized just *feels* good and it makes you more productive, more likely to have people over, more likely to enjoy your relaxing time. I think doing even little things boosts your mental space that day.

**TL;DR: If it takes fewer than 15 minutes, do it now. If it has to be done anyway, make a list and do it. Don't keep stuff that doesn't fit or have a use, purge, clean 1 thing each day, easier to keep up than to catch up, break it up into sections, clutter is bad for your home and your mind** "
"When I asked them to hang out and they all either ignored the question or said no. After this happened ten times in a row over a period of several months, I just gave up. "
"A kitten was dropped off in our neighborhood, she was dirty and hungry so obviously she had been on her own for a while before we spotted her. My sister and I caught her and brought her into the house and into the bathroom to quarantine her from the other cats until we could get her checked out. I woke at 5 the next morning, hearing my Dad get ready to leave for work. Mom knew about the kitten, but Dad didn't. My Dad is a big dude covered in tattoos with hair like a viking. With baited breath I lay in my bed listening until Mom opened the door to show him and he said, ""Look at the little baby kitty!"" 

And I knew then [she was ours.](http://68.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9dk97j8Jd1qjd6u5o5_1280.jpg). "

"Sansa Stark's rape.

First of all, it didn't even need to be included in the story. In the books, some other girl—who has never been a show character—was raped. Sansa was randomly given this girl's rape storyline simply because, well, why not show even more torturing-women-porn on GoT, eh? I know the show is brutal and savage. No doubt. But it's like the writers get off on inflicting as much pain as possible onto the female characters. 

Second of all, her rape ended up being not even about her but about how much it hurt *Theon*. She wasn't even given the dignity of us seeing how it affected HER as it happened, oh no—the camera panned over to Theon's horrified eyes. Because lord knows Theon's manpain following Sansa's rape is more important than actually focusing on how it affected Sansa, right? 🙄

RUNNER-UP: how Jaime raped Cersei. Not only was it, again, *wholly* unnecessary because Jaime Lannister is not a rapist—in fact, he mentions several times in the books how he wouldn't force himself upon a woman—but it was also glossed over after, as if all he did was give her an innocent neck massage...versus raping her. But, ya know. Gotta get that rape in for shock value. 😒

SECOND RUNNER-UP: how Drogo raped Dany. The whole point of their relationship being amazing in the books was that *Drogo didn't force her*. In the show? Nah. He just took her by force while she cried and said ""No."" And yet, she still fell in love with him after and the rape was never addressed.

Uh, I think you guys can see a pattern with GoT here. And one can't even blame it on ""Well, it's a brutal world!"" because GRRM handled things way better in the actual books. It's just the show which seems to live to show women being abused.

**EDIT**: Okay, I just remembered another that appalled me. In Shameless, when Sheila and Frank first start living together, she ties him up to her bed and uses her sex toys on him while he yells and screams, ""NOOOO!"" I understand we're supposed to hate Frank and like Sheila and therefore the scene was supposed to come off as comedic—but it didn't to me. Because as much of a scumbag as Frank is, he didn't deserve to get raped. And that *was* rape; Sheila never waited for him to acually consent to her doing that. It always makes me feel really uncomfortable that the show totally ignored that (I'm on season 4 now so no spoilers please!)."
"Cuddling, stroking my hair. Sometimes he brings cheesecake immediately after and trust me, there is no better cheesecake than post-coital cheesecake. It make it *amazing.*"
"I'll start. I hate that guys always list ""girls who like reality TV"" as a dealbreaker. I feel like it is to me what sports is to them. I watch episodes each week just like they watch sporting events each week. I keep up with the social media posts and happenings. I don't sink money into it or play fantasy effing reality squad either. "

"I'd just left my toxic job and was unemployed. We were going to visit my grandmother but wanted to stop for lunch beforehand. I thought we were just going to get a pie from a bakery but Mum took me to this super fancy restaurant. We had rabbit ragu, crab risotto, duck, wine, coffee, cake, everything. She footed the $250 bill and simply said ""you said that when you left that place we would go somewhere nice, now never, ever, tell your father.""

Love my Mum. :)"
"I sort of assume they either didn't connect with their therapist (and didn't go to someone else), aren't being fully honest with their doctor, therapist or themselves or didn't put the work into it that is required. You can't just show up to appointments and expect to be ""cured.""

It's probably not a fair assumption to make but it's the first thing I think. "
People who refer to themselves as 'brutally honest' tend to enjoy the brutality more than they care about the honesty.
"Contouring. I can't be bothered with that shit. My face is chubby and that's fine.


Foundation. I used to wear it every day, but I gave up. My skin is really dry and it just clings to all the dry patches and makes me look worse. I don't suffer from acne, but I do have slight redness and unevenness so my skin isn't anywhere near perfect. I just don't care though. I think it's okay for skin to look like skin.


I honestly love makeup and beauty and generally grooming myself, but it's a fun thing for me. Things like foundation/contouring aren't fun for me, so I don't do them."
"[unfuck your habitat](http://unfuckyourhabitat.tumblr.com/) has some helpful tips, namely: 

* set a timer for 20 minutes, take a break for 10, and rinse and repeat until the area is clean
* start with one area and clean off the flat surfaces
* it's okay not to clean everything all at once; in fact, it becomes a lot more overwhelming if you do. start with some small corner of your bedroom or another room you spend a lot of time in, and work your way through the rest of the house. 
* do things concurrently; put the laundry in while you clean the living room, let the dishes soak while you spend twenty minutes tidying your bedroom, or spray down your bathtub with cleaner and let it do its shit while you're doing the dishes.
* set a habit tracker or reminder on your phone to keep up with it and do daily maintenance cleaning, because the hardest thing after doing a massive exhausting post-depression clean is waking up and cleaning *again* the next day, but a little goes a long way on that front"
"He talks during sex - either narration, complements, or (at my request) fantasy scenarios. It's the hottest thing ever."
"Aside from what's already been mentioned, that men are expected to pay for everything.

2 of my close friends always get on my case over how I prefer to go dutch on dates. They think it's bizarre that I don't like being ~spoiled and always say shit like ""if you don't make him spend money on you early on, he'll stop trying to impress you later."" Except, y'know, I have no interest in having him spend excessive amounts of money on me - I'm not impressed by money, I'm more impressed by my preferences and opinions being respected."

"My guy is the same way- he even ASKED if he could kiss me at the end of our first date and was so shy and awkward about it. He's a massive dork and not a big talker... But he is just such a careful, thoughtful person it makes me love being with him - he goes out of his way to make me smile and can't stand to see me upset or sad... I adore him.

And it's the exact opposite in the bedroom. He's not afraid (anymore) to get rough, demanding, controlling - even humiliating. Its amazing and our sex life continues to get better and better as we learn each other better and grow our trust. After an abusive relationship where I WAS raped and beat I thought I could never indulge in kink again - but he's so CAREFUL with me, even when pinning me down, biting/spanking/slapping me and I know the second something goes wrong it's backrubs and star trek... Ooomph.

"I was like 14 at the time and out with a friend. It was a snow day and we were making snow men. This guy rolled up in his car, he was like at least 30+ years old and asked if we'd like to 'see his carrot'. :/ We didn't say anything and he wouldn't leave, and then he got out of the car. My friend and I ran down the road and around the corner to hide in her house. We saw him get in his car, drive around the corner and shouted for us something like ""Hey pretty girls, where are you?"" We stayed hidden and saw him get frustrated, at which point he kicked over all the snowmen all our neighbours had made."
"This probably isn't the worst I've seen, but it sticks out in my memory. The 21st century *Doctor Who* show has had various issues with portraying women, and this was one of the most glaring examples.

At one point, Amy and Rory are in the process of getting a divorce, and it seems to just be because of generic arguing that started off-screen. But then it turns out she drove him to that point and started the process *solely* because she isn't able to carry more children, and she knows he wants to have them. He already knew this, and he was content. It's not like she talked to him and they mutually decided to separate for that reason. He had no idea that was why she was divorcing him. So her reaction to finding out about her infertility was to break her husband's heart, not even giving him a choice to be happy with her. What??"
I appreciate the double play. Shifting blame AND new washer. Nicely done. 
"And, with that, dreams are made."

"Yes. His relationship was coming to an end on both sides and they parted ways civilly (civilly enough we were invited to her wedding a couple of years later).

"When one of the girls in the group starting being horrible to me, and excluding me from things, and everyone else was just like ""whelp, don't want to take sides here"". When someone is being an asshole and you decide to remain neutral, you're for all intents and purposes taking their side."
"My dad had been promising me for years to get a dog, with no intention of following through. Well, one weekend he was out of town, and my mom was *juuussst* drunk enough to get me a puppy. She justified it as just fulfilling a promise my dad had made. Which is true.

We didn't tell him, and he didn't even notice her at first.

"I'd been treated like dirt by the last couple of blokes I'd been out with, and late night messaged my friend to vent about how miserable I was. Co-incidentally he had just broken up with his girlfriend the night before. We more or less decided to pity fuck each other.

He was very upfront about not wanting a relationship, and I felt so broken and discarded that I just let it be a casual thing, because I honestly had no strength. 

However the sex was life changing, so we just kept at it. I remember one day months later he just grabbed me and kissed me and said 'I can keep my hands off you', and I knew something had shifted.

It's been two-ish years now, and we have a house and an amazing future together."
"I once pretended to be an actual catfish online. I wrote about my experiences swimming in the Mississippi River and about the time I bit someone's mole right off their back, and complained about having such long whiskers. No one fell for it, though. Gotta step up my game."

My nickname for my oldest daughter when she was younger was ""the informant."" But it goes both ways: they always rat him out when he goes to the grocery store when I'm at work (rarely do I allow this because he is an impulse buyer and also because he thinks anything on an endcap is on sale) and buys all kinds of random things, like Oreos with bacon/Twinkie filling. "
My mom taught me how to drive about a year earlier than I should have been taught. She told me to play dumb when my dad decided it was time to teach me. Later we talked and she admitted she wanted me to have a better foundation than my dad could teach cause my dad sucks at driving. I'm 33 now and we finally told him in passing one day. He laughed really hard and said something about her being the professional anyway since at the time she was a UPS driver.
"I went through a local clinic in my area in 2012, and got $5,000. It was a very long process, and I didn't mind the injections so much as the amount of time I had to take off work or get up super early to go check in with the doctor or get blood drawn. 

I had no weird side effects and found the procedure painless in the end."

Kids would shop at Hot Topic, blast ""preps"" and ""normies,"" wear all black, claim to be ""disturbed"" as if that was a cool thing,claim to be ""goth"" and ""wicca"" with no idea what those words actually mean, and so on. But really they're just middle-class suburbanites with no real problems, no dark mysteries, and every bit as conformist as they claim everyone in pink to be. 

I was one of them. 

I still like black, but I no longer act like I'm different or special for it. "

"I was tired of getting interviews and not getting a job, so I started asking whoever was interviewing me if they'd have time to give me some feedback after the interview or send a quick email with feedback. I was surprised how many people actually sent me an email. One woman even made an appointment with me a week later to go over her notes from my interview. A good portion of people just acted like I was crazy for asking. It's part of what landed me my current job. My boss was really impressed that I'd ask something like that and he decided he wanted me on his team as soon as I asked.

Now, I don't know if it's the smartest strategy or not. I started asking because I was so frustrated and tired of job searching. I figured I must be doing something that wasn't working to my advantage. I got a lot of great tips about how I was presenting myself and where I could tighten up my interview skills."
"Many of my friends were personally affected by the Pulse massacre, and they are currently fighting to prevent a TV show from airing on a spanish network in Orlando. The show is a fictionalized re-enactment that depicts the shooting with really graphic violence.

To imagine doing something so offensive not even a year after it happened is just completely disgusting to me. "

"This used to be a dealbreaker for me and just recently I've been able to get over it, so I'll try to explain. 

Women are supposed to be feminine.  Femininity is delicate, tiny, demure, etc. 

I am six feet tall and up until about two years ago, overweight.  I was physically taller and stronger than a lot of men.  And not in a ""Amazon warrior"" kind of way.  

Dating someone taller than me was the only way I was able to pretend to feel feminine.  No matter how large I was, he was larger, and the dynamic in our relationship could be man-bigger lady-smaller.  

It's something that I've only recently gotten over internally.  Fuck that definition of femininity.  I can be feminine and tall and strong with big feet and hands.  My partner can make me feel sexy and cherished in other ways besides physical height.  

But it took a lot of time and a lot of introspection on my part to get over my height ""dealbreaker"".  "
"Not so much one habit,  but many habits that I slowly dropped over time.  It started with cutting out soda and candy,  and over the course of about two years turned into what I can honestly say is an almost completely healthy diet.  I lost 40 pounds and have kept it off effortlessly for 14 years.  I think making small changes on my own time instead of changing everything at once was my key to success.  I gave myself time to focus and adjust to each small change,  so I was never overwhelmed or felt deprived.  "

"&gt; he says he gets a rush of energy after sex so he wants to get up and go do things

I wish this kind of thing didn't happen. Immediately after orgasm with a partner, it's like I'm afflicted with the opposite of depression: I think of all sorts of things I'd like to do. Catch up on old video games or TV shows, get some shopping out of the way, do some quick clean-up around the apartment, and so on. Gentle romance becomes one of the last things on my mind, and I have to force myself to stick around and cuddle.

The rush of energy eventually passes, but I wish I could enjoy the cuddling as quickly as my partner does."
"One guy asked to ""fuck my ass"" every single time we had sex. He couldn't understand that it was not AT ALL appealing to me, insisting that I would love it and ask for more. I ended things after a month.

The same guy wanted to hold my head down during a blowjob so I would gag ""because that's really hot"". YEAH hot for you, asshole. 

I was at a party the other day and a few male friends were complaining about how lame blowjobs are when the girl doesn't moan while doing it. I really don't get what she should be moaning about. I get being turned on by an erect penis, but moaning though?!?! Without any stimulation?!?! I'm convinced the moaning they have heard is all fake.

Edit: I just thought of more:

- Dirty talk. One guy was like ""tell me where you want that hard cock"", and I started laughing because it was SO ridiculous. I have nothing against like ""omg you're so hot"" but... where do you want that hard cock? it's not like there were that many options...

- I've had guys try to cum in my face and not understanding why I was completely turned off. That's fucking gross and I don't want that shit in my hair.

- Soooooo many guys think that aiming STRAIGHT FOR THE VAGINA right away is gonna make me lose my mind. They don't get that if I'm not already really turned on, shoving your fingers in my vagina is not gonna do it.

- Most guys I've slept with seem to think that deep and fast and hard and with as many fingers as possible is the best recipe for fingering. -_-"

"My mom let me hide a cat from my dad in my bedroom. Had her food and litter box and everything in there for weeks and it was going great, dad had no idea. 

Then one day I was hanging out with my dad downstairs and my mom was upstairs vacuuming. She apparently totally forgot about the secret cat hiding in my room and went in there with the vacuum. 

Cat took the opportunity to run and ran right past my dad and me downstairs. A whole lot of ""what the hell was that?!"" and yelling later, I got to have a non-secret cat. "

"I was surprised to learn he has a lactation fetish! He always  loved sucking on my nipples and breast play during sex which does wonders to get me off! 

He confessed the deeper affinity for boobs several years into our relationship, and I was surprisingly turned on by the idea. He was so enthusiastic and genuine I couldn't not give it a try. Now we'll find a comfy way to cuddle and he'll just nurse on me for half an hour or so while I hold him close. There's no adult baby fetish involved or anything like that. Just mouth and boobs. It's weird, but incredibly pleasurable and satisfying. It almost always leads to incredible sex and lots of orgasms for all! It makes me feel close to him but so strong and feminine, too. I know it's weird, but it works for us.

I've never lactated before and don't have the sort of time or discipline to make it happen without a baby. Maybe one day real milk will happen, but just the practice is enough, too!"

I can't think of any other beauty ritual that I absolutely refuse to try, but there are plenty that I don't see the point of or that I've tried and decided it's just not for me.

I've tried waxing, using bronzer, coloring in my eyebrows, fake tanning, using apple cider vinegar, and plenty other ones that people on here have mentioned, but have decided they just arnt for me for one reason or another.

"I have the most trouble conveying this to my non-American friends. I'll tell them I have/had an interview and they'll immediately ask ""what's the salary?"" And I swear, I have to continuously explain to them that most interviews, you're going in blind. Some jobs post a salary or salary range, but it somehow became the culture here to not discuss salary until you've been offered the job or are at least one or two interviews deep. This isn't the case in Eastern Europe, and I know a bunch of companies want to make sure a candidate is the ""right fit"" and ""passionate about the mission,"" but i can't tell you how many times I've wasted time preparing for and going to interviews just to be told the salary is pennies or significantly lower than my current position. Why waste people's time?"

Idk it sucked but I needed to have a job and I was in the process of lining something up which wouldn't start until the following year so I couldn't be bothered to look for *another* stop-gap job as well in the meantime. Staying put for that time was the lesser evil. "

I've swatched lipsticks and shadows on the backs of my hands before, but I'd NEVER be ok with putting that stuff on my face, holy crap.

And sometimes I'll see people talking about how they make special trips to Sephora to ask for a sample of moisturizer / face cream / whatever, and like.. ok, I know you're supposed to make those samples using a disposable mini spatula, but those containers are out on the floor where anyone can stick their grubby hands straight into them, so your SA might be following protocol, but hundreds of people most likely aren't. No thanks."

I mean everybody listens to music and obviously some people like music more than others but a lot of the times I find that people who say things like ""Music is my life"" and stuff like that are very snobby about their music tastes and make you feel bad for listening to pop or generally popular music. Not all music has to be deep and meaningful, sometimes I just want a cool beat to listen to."

She talked bad about me when I wasn't there, nothing outrageous but still untrue things. Just stuff like that. I eventually realized that when I was with them I was angry, miserable, and self-conscious. When I talked to other friends in the group about what was happening, they kind of just shrugged and said they didn't thing it was all that bad. I decided that I'd rather be alone than have ""friends"" like that so I just quit planning things with them and went silent on them if I got invites from them. I was better off from the moment I decided that over and out with the lot of them."
"I'm the kid, not the parent, but my mom didn't really say anything. I first came out to her (as questioning) by accident. I had a Gay-Straight Alliance event in the evening, but she picked me up from school beforehand for a dentist appointment. One of my friends had already braided a rainbow ribbon into my hair. My mom asked what it was for, and I told her it was for GSA since rainbows are for gay pride. Without thinking, she asked, ""Are you gay?"" and also without thinking I said, ""I'm not sure."" Then they called me into the dentist's office and we didn't really address it.

I started identifying as asexual shortly thereafter. I don't really remember coming out to her, but she basically just said okay and thanks for telling her and that was it. What I remember more was a few months later when I was trying to explain something about asexuality to her and she said, ""I know, I read all about it."" I was surprised, and she told me as soon as I came out to her, the first thing she did was go online and do a ton of research about asexuality so she would understand. The best part was she said it like it was the most obvious and natural reaction to your kid coming out--which it is, but most parents don't do that."

"I was about 8. My father likes metal detecting, and once when I was a kid left me in the car for a while as he went metal detecting in a field. He said there was a pie in the back of the car and said 'Make sure not to sit on it! You can eat it, but don't sit on it!'. 

After an hour or so I got hungry, and started eating bits of the pie. Turns out the pie was a gift for the farmer who had let my Dad onto his land, and the 'you can eat it thing' was him making a joke. 

I'm really embarrassed about the fact I ate a pie that was meant for a gift, but even now think 'WTF Dad?' for making a joke like that whilst leaving me in a car over lunchtime! Hah!"

"i've done it before. it backfired really tremendously, in the SO's eyes i was just a jealous slur making up lies to get them to break up so i could have him for myself, and he was happy to go with that story.

"No longer online dating, but I always liked to see interesting photos. Shirt on (unless at the beach), no sunglasses, preferably not in a bathroom. Other people are OK as long as it's clear who you are. Hobby pictures are cool (running, hiking, climbing, playing an instrument, etc). Less is more - i.e. no 17 shirtless bathroom selfies. 

As for the profiles, my favorites were the ones that came off a good, genuine description of the person. Too short and too long (i.e. essay length) were less interesting to me. Anything that came off as too gimmicky was also a turn off. Good things to include are job, hobbies, values, what you're looking for, etc."

"My ex was a terrible gift-giver in general, so I have a threeway tie, each frustrating in its own way.

 * Asked for my Amazon wishlist to get me a Christmas gift. On the wishlist are all the books I don't have by my favorite author, some movies, etc. Bought me one of the books I already had and thought he'd done a great job tracking down an obscure book I didn't know about. This was mostly infuriating because of the general attitude that he'd know better than I did about an author I've been obsessing over for years. 

 * The birthday he got me a video game I'd been looking at, but on a system I didn't own so I'd have to play it at his house. I got to play it twice, then he finished his own save file and traded the game in to buy something for himself.

 * Literally gave me an IOU for valentines one year. I'd spent $200 buying him starter manuals for a tabletop system he wanted to try out. He had a full-time job and his parents paid his bills, while I was working part-time finishing school and paying all my own bills. He never followed through on the IOU."
"Combination of being a giant piece of shit and not wanting to believe he was capable of doing something like that.


What's amusing to me (now) is that even though I was very clear about *why* I was cutting them out of my life, even over 10 years later I still have people who *don't understand* why I did it.  One of their parents even went so far as to reach out to one  of my sisters on FB talking about how [ex-friend] needed ""loyal friends in her life right now"" because she knew I would see it.  



I just laughed and left it alone.  The fuck do I care that rape apologists are having a hard time?"
"I have seven children. I got married very young and wanted one child. After we had him, we, like most new parents, thought he was objectively the greatest child to have ever lived, and decided that we wanted at least three. Child #4 was a BIG surprise. After #4, we decided we wanted one more. Directly after #5, we moved to another state and our financial situation changed a great deal, and we had a lot more money, and because of the way the kids were staggered (boy, boy, girl, girl, boy), the oldest two ""pairs"" tended to do everything together, so we decided to have just one more so he would have a friend close to his age. We had the sixth and we were DONE. Then three years later, we got divorced. I met a man who had never been married and had never had children, and he wanted a child. I loved having my six kids, so I was happy to have a child with him, and the other kids were extremely excited about the prospect of having a new sibling. So we had the seventh and he's a delight. 

It is not difficult for me to take care of so many kids. I was very lucky because my children love babies and younger children, so for the past three kids, but ESPECIALLY with our youngest, the main problem is ""too many cooks in the kitchen."" They all think they're parents, they all rush to comfort him when he cries, they all know what's best. 

The most challenging part is to be a good steward of the environment and the world. I have seven kids, so it's more important for our family, because we have a bigger impact on the environment, to teach minimalism. We are financially in a very easy situation, but we are strong opponents of wasteful purchases. I regularly teach the kids about the impact of ""fast fashion""-- cheap clothing that wears out after a year or two. We buy very high quality brands, but only at thrift stores-- high quality brands last longer, and buying them at thrift stores means that no new clothing is produced for our family (except for family portrait day or holidays-- then I just go to Gymboree or Janie and Jack and make it rain). We recycle, and we live in a home that is large, but would typically probably house a family with maybe three kids. I also take my responsibility very seriously with regard to the social impact that seven kids will have on the world, as opposed to a more usual two. We try to teach them that empathy is the most important virtue they can have-- a few weeks ago we thought it would be funny to hear their answers to one of those memes where you ask kids questions about their parents. We asked, ""What's something Mommy always says?"" The six year old answered, ""You say that the most important thing we can ever do is to relieve suffering when we see it. And also the F-word. You say that a lot."" And I do believe that that's the most important thing for me to do as a parent of so many kids-- to teach them that when they see suffering, they should do their best to relieve it, whether it's through becoming a doctor, becoming a foster parent, working as a cashier and offering kindness to a person they meet who seems sad, volunteering, standing up for others, whatever. I don't care what they choose with regard to career or education. I just want them to be kind. 

So those are the most difficult parts-- taking responsibility for the fact that I have a bunch of kids who will make both a social and ecological impact on the world. "

"Women are people, not prizes to be won.  Collaborate with your partners, build a life *together*, rather than trying to build a life for her.  

There will be some people that you'd *really like* to be in a relationship with but can't successfully, because you two want different things.  That sucks, but is ok.  Don't give up on things you really want in your life for someone else, and don't expect them to give up their dreams for you.  

Other than those dealbreakers, relationships are 80% communication.  Talk stuff out, little stuff as well as big stuff, so that you learn how to work through disagreements on minor issues before you have to tackle something really hard.  Fighting isn't a bad sign, though fighting dirty is.  

Don't play games, or put up with people who do.  Be up front about who you are and what you want.  Accept both ""yes"" and ""no"" as legitimate answers.  Don't try to change people or save them, and don't hang out with people who want to save or change you -- unless you want that help."

Fun. I don't remember having any particularly strong emotional reactions to it - aside from drunken embarrassment the first time - but it was fun. 
"The Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 9 comics where she blacks out a party and soon finds out she's pregnant. She thinks about what to do and talks to another character whose mother was a previous slayer about it before deciding to get an abortion. Before she can do it, she finds out that she's not actually pregnant, just a robot. At the party she was drugged without her knowledge, but Andrew switched her mind with a robot that looked like her and her body was actually living in a house with a strange 1950's housewife style fantasy to protect her from another slayer who wanted to kill her. And for some reason he didn't think about telling her until one of her arms came off during a fight and she confronted him about it. I don't know if that was some sort of cop-out or if it was planned, but it was the most ridiculous thing from that series. 

Also, the whole convenient miscarriage trope they use in shows. As the World Turns, for example, had one character have one after she wasn't sure whether to give up her baby for adoption to a couple, let her mom raise it, raise it herself, or have an abortion. You'd expect it in a show like that, but it's pretty common in a lot of different ones. "

I had been having a bad day in the first place, with some really nasty people yelling at me over stupid things, when this lady comes up with her two-year-old daughter and a coupon that expired three months ago. When I told her I couldn't use her coupon, and it very clearly had the expiration date on it, she told her daughter in this really sweet voice, ""This lady is just the devil, isn't she? Isn't she?""

I just left in the middle of the transaction and went to the bathroom to cry. For some reason, this woman telling her daughter that I was literally *The Devil* for not accepting her coupon just set me off."

"The stereotype of American Southerners as being lazy and slow was an artifact of endemic hookworm infection there and the prevalence of lead contamination of the soil dating from the Civil War as documented by the Rockefeller Foundation in 1912. The battle to improve the health and increase the productivity of the American South took seventy years, the push for the development of indoor plumbing after the establishment of pit privies. Endemic hookworm infection and lead poisoning and their sequelae are considered responsible for income differentials of up to 25% **to this day** in the poorest states of the South.

"Agree with you 100%. 

I'm very sex-positive too but I feel like people (also often feminists) can be too quick to dismiss that since everything we observe has an effect on us, sex is not an exception. I think that people get defensive quickly when they feel that their sexual preferences are being ""criticized"". 

But sex doesn't happen in a social vacuum which is fine. I wish that more people would talk about it though. Not everything about sex and porn is 100% empowering and I definitely think that porn often depicts degrading acts as ""normal""."

"I wore a pair of pants once that was literally so tight I couldn't fart...like, they squeezed my butt cheeks together so tight that I couldn't achieve any airflow. I sat uncomfortably with a trapped fart for hours until I couldn't take it anymore. I stepped into the bathroom (just a single room--no stalls--which I forgot to lock), unzipped my pants, pulled my ass out, and spread my butt...the relief I felt was unlike anything I've ever felt before, like I'd had a bowling ball on my belly and it was suddenly lifted. Suddenly, the door opens and I'm face-to-face with a coworker. I make eye contact with her for a brief second in my vulnerable position before she closes the door again without a word."
"I had someone burst out laughing at me because of how I looked during multiple orgasms... That moment is firmly lodged in my memory.

Sex is vulnerable and intimate to me, and to have someone thoroughly *burst out laughing*, unable to contain themselves due to how I look and sound during an intimate moment... Not a good feeling in the least.

Sorry I don't match up with your imagine of what multiple orgasms are supposed to look and sound like, buddy.

I seriously have no idea what he was expecting, or maybe he was just an asshole. I've never had anyone else complain about my enthusiasm."

"We met at work and were both in separate relationships. After a couple of months of us talking during lunch breaks about normal stuff he broke up with his girlfriend and became single. A month later I broke up with my boyfriend. We never spoke to each other about our relationships so we didn't know the other was single until about 2 weeks after I broke up with my boyfriend....

I found out much later that he broke up with his girlfriend because he spent all of his time while he was with her thinking about me and wanting to talk to me, which he knew wasn't fair on his girlfriend at the time, even though they'd been together for four years (it had been happy to start with but when I met him they were in a rut). He broke up with her not because he wanted to be with me (he didn't think I was going to break up with my boyfriend), but because he didn't want to be with one woman while thinking about another. It wasn't fair on him or his ex-girlfriend. 

I broke up with my boyfriend for similar reasons and we got together not too long afterwards. And now we're married! "

He walked around the house in his boxer shorts, even with neighbors in the front room - I guess that was supposed to be funny. He pinched and patted the butts of his three daughters and laughed at our surprise and disgust. I'm sure my mother said something to him in private but she was a quiet retiring woman and it was a different time. I don't know if any men in the neighborhood said anything to him but I'm sure they would have been blown off as making a big deal out of nothing. It was tolerated as his norm for too long. He is dead now but my brothers still defend him."
"I'm reminded of my business studies lessons from a decade ago on motivation. 

There was a guy called Herzberg who identified what he called ""hygiene factors"" alongside motivation factors. The hygiene factors were things like clean facilities, job security, being paid on time and so on; they're things that don't really motivate you but their absence is really demotivating. Job security is a good one from thatn list, you don't really become more productive if you know your job is safe but if you don't have that you're going to dislike the job. 

Anyway, I view ""being nice"" as one of those hygiene factors. If you're nice that's great, I love being around nice people! I like to think that I'm not a arsehole but I don't go touting it as a virtue."
"The third one was really the key for me.

Managed to get it cleaned off, thank goodness. "

"Bedroom talk of watching other men fuck me, I was shocked he liked the idea. I told him about a story I read where the woman was bet in a poker game by her husband. The husband lost and had to watch the opponent take her sexually. I mentioned how it turned me on. Well, apparently it turned him on too. Because now he talks about sharing me with other men all the time and I love it. He talks about swinging with couples. We may or may not ever do it, but the talk about it in bed makes me crazy. "
I feel like the house is a dead giveaway of changed feelings 
"That sucks, I'm sorry. But your reaction should not be ""I am never opening up to anybody again""!! It should be ""she was a shitty partner for me, and I should find someone who can have a mature discussion about these important issues."""
"When I was about 7, I tried to shoplift some candy from a Walmart. My mom discovered it and made me walk back in and give it to a manager and admit what I did. I can't fault her for doing it, but 20 years later, every time it plays out in my head I get the same anxiety and it makes my chest tight and my stomach turn. I don't know why it had such a profound affect on me. "

So we waited until he went to the dentist and my mom helped me change the outlets. To this day he still has no idea."

"When my best friend had her baby. Sounds harsh but I'm not a kid person, and I was scared that she would become a totally different person and we wouldn't be able to relate like we used to.

Nope. Totally the opposite. And I LOVE THAT KID TO PIECES. We still go do fun stuff and bring her along. There's rarely a weekend when I'm not hanging out with them at least one of the nights. I don't even mind staying in with her because she's still her badass self and like I said before, I love that kid like she's my own. "

But if you eat meat, you aren't a vegetarian.  If that hurts your feelings, maybe fuck right off into a cactus.  And go read about what a vegetarian is.

"I stopped wearing high heels, because honestly just walking in them makes me grumpy."
"My best friend since we were toddlers...ugh.

Anyway, the years wore on and I became a lot like her. Conceited. Shallow. **itchy with a massive capital B. I was a shitty snot of a human being and I got tired of being me.

I don't blame anything on her at all. It was my doing and mine alone. Has anyone here burned out on oneself? yeah...not pleasant.

So, I was slowly sliding back to being a human being, and I saw my friends for what they were. My best friend in particular was vapid and cruel, and shallow and selfish.

Her boy was a sweet loving fella, and she told him to quit being a faggot. I felt like like punching her in the neck the first time I heard her say it...it was a shockingly cruel thing to say, and it took the twinkle right out of his eyes.

Mean and cruel.

Her hubby saved up enough dough to start his own business. She agreed to living in poverty for a few years....so off he went. A year later she decided to divorce him because of not enough money. I told her right then and there that if she broke up her family, we were done.

She showed up on my doorstep with bags in hand and saying she was getting a divorce.

Right as rain, I told her to go piss off. She had an awesome husband and awesome kids and she traded it all away for designer clothes. I told her to piss off and I meant it. best friends since diapers and I told her to go piss up a rope.

I let my life unravel from there, but it needed unraveling.

I love being with other couples for a number of reasons but the biggest one (other than that I love the attention) is that I love seeing that sort of intimacy between people who love each other.

They'll want to invite a friend to stay for a few days and then get frustrated when the plans don't get worked out magically and said friend never actually comes to see them.  Or he and the friend will manage to make a plan, but then he'll get frustrated because he keeps having to make trips to the store because the guest bathroom wasn't stocked and doing mundane chores because the bed wasn't made and the guest towels hadn't been washed.

"If you're having a disagreement, don't call names. You can put this into practice in any situation, but especially with your partner. Name calling doesn't help your argument; it only serves to hurt the other person unnecessarily, and potentially make you sound ignorant. I'm not even talking about swearing -- calling someone stupid or pathetic can be just as damaging. If it doesn't work towards solving the issue, it's not worth saying."

"Currently in a new relationship (yay!) so I've been having to battle the whole the toxic thought that he might be cheating on me. He hasn't nor do I have any real indication that he would, but in line with this idea of ""I'm not worthy"". I know if he did do that then it'd be more telling of him than me but I just wrestle with not feeling like I'm worthy of anything so I would take up the blame even though I shouldn't in that case."

"I started dressing nicely. Nothing overtly showy, but in clothing that actually fit my body. This meant ignoring trends and just dressing in styles that suited me.

I cut my hair. Sure, not every guy likes short hair (it's often a pixie cut), but those who do *really* do. Besides, my long hair was drab and lacked much style. And more importantly, my short hair makes me feel confident. I can't hide behind my bangs anymore. 

I go out. It's hard for anyone to notice you when you're not somewhere you can be noticed. I can't be a homebody due to my career goals, and I want to have a bit of a social life, so I end up socializing in different environments."

"I met my boyfriend on Tinder, and I swiped left on a whole lot of guys before I came across his profile.

"I fold most of the laundry in our house. I don't ever match socks, but one day I was feeling generous and matched all my husband's socks for him. Later that afternoon we got in a minor argument and I went back and unmatched every single pair so he would have to take the time to do it. "
"My first boyfriend was perpetually disappointed by our sex life because we didn't immediately start having porn-style sex right after losing our virginities. He didn't realise that we weren't both going to be amazing right away, and even after we'd been having sex for a while he couldn't get past it. He expected us both to be porn stars just...instinctively. He genuinely believed that porn was an accurate depiction of sex. 

It never occurred to him that porn was unrealistic. He understood that the bodies of the female porn stars weren't what average women looked like, but he honestly believed that everyone in the world had crazy porno-sex multiple times a day. Since he couldn't, he used to get really upset and angry with me."

It may just have been her wacky ass.

"We moved from Arkansas to the DC suburbs for my fiance's job.  We'd been misled about the cost of living and experienced some serious sticker shock - my fiance's salary was only $31k which is not enough to live on in the DC suburbs.  He had to get his HR department to lie about his salary so we could qualify for the cheapest apartment we could find ($1,000 for a one bedroom 60 minutes from his work).  

I had recently graduated college so for the first month I tried to find jobs somehow related to my major, then we were in desperate need of money so I just started applying for every job I could find.  It took 3 months for me to get one.  I was actually expecting a call for a gas station job when a software development company called and told me their first choice hadn't worked out so they offered me the job.  

Moving was actually super easy because his company paid for it.  It was one of those ""Pack Rat"" type services where you put everything in shipping containers and they hold them for you.  

After we'd lived there for a few years, we decided that it just wasn't the area for us.  The cost of living was just ridiculous.  So we saved what we could, made a list of cities with low unemployment and low cost of living, and ended up picking Tulsa.  It would have cost $3k+ to rent a Uhaul one way across the country, so we donated/threw out most of our belongings and just rebought them after we moved.  We kept the expensive electronics (computer, TV), and stuff that was either irreplaceable or we knew we'd need.  So we moved with like two towels, three pots and pans, a couple of cooking utensils, etc.  

I got really lucky because when I put in my notice, my employer offered to let me work from home, so I didn't have to look for a new job.  If they hadn't, we'd actually calculated that we could live just as well in Tulsa off of two minimum wage jobs as we could in the DC suburbs on our combined $80k a year.  My fiance was actually able to find a good paying job in Tulsa pretty quickly because of his IT skills (in the DC suburbs he couldn't get a similar job because he didn't have a college degree)."
"I brought it up after a month of dating.

I know that makes me sound psycho, but it was actually a modern arranged marriage, so this timeline is not unusual - our parents introduced us and we spent months emailing and getting to know each other and then finally met and dated (with the view of considering each other as potential marriage partners) for one month.

At that point I told him my answer was a 'yes' because I really liked him and our views and values lined up on all the big topics. He then told me he was almost there but needed a bit more time and then got back to me 9 hours later with his own 'yes' :)

We were then engaged for a year and a bit, and have now been married for 3 months, I'm 25 and he's 26. We are so happy and in love; it was a total leap of faith, but probably the best decision I've ever made :)"

Freshman year of high school I was super socially awkward. I was sitting in my English class next to this really popular guy picking my nose, when the teacher hands me a stack of paper to take one and pass it down. 

Without thinking, I grabbed the stack of papers with my hand that had just been in my nose. I smeared my bloody booger all over the paper on top. I'm not sure what possessed me, but in the moment I decided to take a clean paper underneath, and pass the bloody booger paper to Mr. Popular next to me. 

Obviously Mr. Popular was extremely grossed out and called me out on it, and the teacher made me take the bloody booger paper. I wanted to curl up and die. "
"Lack of ambition at work. I appreciate that he's loyal and hardworking, but he's been happily sitting in the same job for 10 years even though he's overqualified and underpaid, because he's so loyal to company and anxious about job hunting for something else.

"Loves adventures and loves travel.

I think the general perception is that if you don't love traveling and don't seem like you're outgoing and adventurous, then you're instead boring, wasting your life, stuck in your ways, close minded, etc etc. 

So much so that I think people really fib about that shit when presenting who they are to other people. Or when pressed they say they're always *thinking* about their *next* trip or that a walk to the beach or through the forest is an ""adventure"".

Basically they scale it down so it seems like they aren't lying, when they totally were trying to give off the perception of something other than truth. Indiana jones traveled and went on adventures. You fucking got stoned at a festival and like to look at plane ticket prices after work sometimes.

"When I was in second grade, I had a few problems with my bladder, specifically holding it when I needed to pee. My father came to the school and spoke with my main, art, gym, and music teacher that when I asked to go to the restroom, to allow me to go as soon as possible. He even brought a note from my doctor at the time. 

Well, I was sitting in gym stretching as the gym teacher instructed us and felt that I needed to pee. I raised my hand and politely asked, but the teacher refused, even though the women's restroom was only 8 feet away from me. Anyway, I proceeded to urinate all over my bright, blue pants, leaving me with a big spot as I cried. 

What's great is that no one made fun of me, but the teacher had to deal with a bunch of angry second graders for a few weeks. Great kids. "

I've gotten the feeling that people, even well-meaning ones, don't realize what a full-time thing it is, and how even when you're not applying after your ""shift"" (I always have to structure it like a real workday), you're worrying and obsessing. 

Also, people that aren't qualified to give advice doing so, or offering to read your resume, or asking if you're ""networking."" My sister that hasn't worked in 10+ years was FULL of great advice when I was unemployed last year and it got really really frustrating."

When I told her I couldn't come in before 8 am on such short notice she had the nerve to tell *me* that *I* needed to give *her* notice for 'days off.' Excuse me? Not being available 24/7 with no notice is not the same as asking for a 'day off.' 

Told her not to fuck with me and I'd politely work 2 more weeks.

"&gt; Don't ever buy someone a living thing that takes a ton of responsibility as a surprise gift.

This 1000x. This girl in elementary school got me a goddamn parakeet because she knew I already had one that I really loved. Her parents spent $10 on a pet store bird, but my parents were the ones who had to go out and buy a much bigger cage and suddenly were buying double the amount of food and treats / toys as well. And my 'keet hated the new bird until the day he died 10 years later.

The worst part was that later in the year, the parakeets she'd gotten to copy me were left unattended and flew away and she was ~devastated. So my parents asked her parents if we could gift her 2 parakeets as replacements, and they accepted and were super grateful. Then when we showed up at their place with the 2 parakeets, her parents said ""oh... actually we already bought her 2 cockatiels to cheer her up, so... we don't want those parakeets anymore."" Like... WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK????? The worst part was that they'd stuffed those 2 poor cockatiels in the same cage the parakeets had been in - the cage that was only big enough for one parakeet in the first place."

"Third person here! I've recently been a part of two separate threesomes with two couples and I was told the same thing both times ""thank god you're normal"". 

I like being with couples because there's already a strong level of trust between the two of them and with one night stands or FWB's I'm always worried about trust. When I meet the couples out in public first, I always try to make sure I'm subtly letting them know how hands off I am of their relationship. Once that foundation is set and they know I'm not out to steal one of them away (plus making sure there's an even balance in the bedroom) the night is always a blast!"

"Emotional labor is the ""thinking/caring"" part of maintaining a life. Things like remembering people's birthdays or to buy Christmas presents, noticing the garbage is getting full and that it should be taken out, knowing that company is coming over for the weekend and thinking to do things like have clean towels/extra food in the fridge/change the sheets in the guest room. It's small stuff like inviting people over for dinner and thinking to ask if people have any allergies, or remembering to call your grandparents to thank them for the birthday card.

You often see the solution for the household chore disparity as ""just make a chore wheel!"" or ""just tell him what to do!"" and THAT is the emotional labor part. Just like it's really tiring to always have to be the one who picks where to go for dinner because your partner always just says ""I don't know/care"", it's really tiring to have to be the one always remembering that chores need to be done. In an adult partnership both adults should be capable of knowing how to maintain a household to a basic level. Barring executive function issues, one person really, really shouldn't need to be told ""put your dishes in the dishwasher"" and it's an unfair burden on the other person to always be needing to direct the other person what to do."
