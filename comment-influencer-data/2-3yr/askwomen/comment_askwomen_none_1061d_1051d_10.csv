"Sometimes when I'm grumpy he'll look at me all serious and go ""what kind of pants are those?"" Then he marches over and checks the tag and goes, ""Just what I thought, meanie pants""


It makes me laugh and breaks the bad mood.  Gah I love that man.

Edit: then he tells me I need to take them off :D

Edit 2: Thanks for the gold whoever gilded me!  First gold!"
"My parents, now married 25+ years and living together for even longer, have great solutions to combat repetitiveness.

* My mom will randomly hide stuff for my dad. Usually small gifts (his favorite candy in one of his office supplies drawers, a funny/sweet note in his lunchbox) but also more funny, pranky stuff (like a plastic spider in his favourite coffee cup; dad hates spiders).

* My dad, who works a lot which sometimes put strain on the marriage, will randomly show up at 3 PM at home in the afternoon -- ""I am SO DONE with work! I know I'm now totally messing up your schedule but let's do something FUN!"". Of course, mom will be scoffing and shaking her head a little bit to play the grump, but then they always went out and did something weird they never had time for (like shop for the best pumpkins during autumn season or giggly try on unisex hiking clothes at the survival shop).

* They also have an archive of fun stuff they want to do together. This can be anything from bigger outings (city trips) to medium stuff (go to a museum) and to really casual things (reading books together in the evening). Every time they think of something, they write it down on a note, and whenever they want to change it up or don't know what to do, they randomly pull 3-4 notes from the ""archive"" and then pick one.

* Communication. My mom is especially good at this, and my dad is getting better. I.e., just admitting that stuff is getting repetitive: ""I am in a slump right now and I'm annoyed. What are we going to do about it?"" is something my mom will just blurt out at times. And then my dad starts shooting ideas (""You wanna go to the movies? What do you want to change about the situation right now? I'd like to go on walks in the evening more if possible"").

* Dancing and having fun. It was pretty normal around our house if a good tune came up during household chores (cooking, doing the dishes, etc.) we would just randomly break out into song and dance. This still happens with mom and dad swirling around the living room carpet as if it's a dancefloor. Don't be afraid to be lighthearted and take your SO for a spin through the house with the vacuum cleaner still in one hand (watch out where you step, though).

**EDIT 1:** Thanks for all the upvotes! I'll let mom &amp; dad know that they're doing something right with their marriage.

**EDIT 2:** When I let my parents know about this post &amp; its reactions, they messaged this back: 

* Mom: ""How nice! It's true that I still think Dad is the best &amp; sweetest. We now started going to all kinds of talks and lectures, with the one on Art Nouveau &amp; Deco coming up soon.""

* Dad: ""This is REALLY nice. Hadn't expected there to be so many nice reactions about how we do things &lt;3""

* Mom: ""We're doing good things aren't we :D""

* Dad: ""Yeah, but you don't always realize that you're actually doing such a good job. And I think Mom is the driving force behind all of these things.""

* Mom: ""It also helps that both our parents also had good marriages. And that's sweet of Dad to say :) but that's not true. His ideas are just as good!""

**EDIT 3:** WOW people, Reddit gold!! Thank you so much for this. You've made my parents really happy and they are so proud that everybody enjoys this post. They hope it'll inspire many fun, happy &amp; healthy relationships :)"
"Basically 100% of the time someone says ""don't stop"", it's right when my muscles are about to give out from that particular motion and position."
"I was running around in the rain, tossing a frisbee with some friends, when a guy walked by and grabbed our frisbee once it had dropped. I didn't know the guy personally but it was a small school, so I knew he was in a frat and on the ultimate frisbee team. Really preppy, blond, Ken-doll attractive. 

He's just standing there with our frisbee, examining it, so I ask if he wants to join us. He goes, ""No, this frisbee isn't official weight. I don't want to damage my skills."" And then he places the frisbee back on the wet ground, because even one toss of our inferior disc would have grievously de-calibrated his arm. "
"I decided to go see the musical Spamalot on a whim, that night, by myself. I hadn't showered, so I shoved my hair in a messy bun and put on a clean shirt, but was definitely underdressed. I figured it would be dark and it didn't matter. At the end of Spamalot, they go out in the audience to find the Grail under a chair. And it turned out to be mine. I had to go up on the stage in the biggest theatre in my city, play along with the actors, and take photos with them, with my dirty hair and no makeup. It would have been fun if I hadn't been mortified.

Oh, and the next day, I got a call at work from one of my clients. Turns out he was in the audience and recognized me. Good times. "

"That sick food workers stay home until they're no longer contagious. This is what they're *supposed* to do, and many people assume that food workers stick to this rule. The unfortunate truth is, many food handlers have to work even when they're still very sick because they can't afford not to, there's no one else to cover them, or any number of other reasons. I'm not talking the common cold. I'm talking stomach flu. Its honestly one of the most distressing things I found out while working in the food service industry."
"Not on Reddit, but irl I knew a guy who freaked out when his gf took a bath while pregnant. He thought the baby would drown. "
"Not like that, no.

I went to the drugstore once while I was sick and in pain (and so looked like hell). 

Some guy invited me to a party because I ""looked like [I] like[d] to get high."" 

I was buying ThermaFlu and tampons. "
"My personal favorite was the guy who suggested that we ""practice"" pee standing up in the shower, so we could eventually do it in the toilet. He refused to understand that we lack the equipment, not the ability."
"There was one recently where a guy asked if women *instinctually* know how to tie ties, because his mum and sister knew but he didn't ..."
"Give some sort of feedback. I feel like I am making some sort of noise nonstop while having sex, whether it be moaning or actually talking haha. I just would like some sort of sign that the guy is enjoying it every once in a while."
"I wish they would touch more than just boobs or the vaginal area. I do have more to my body than that. Seems like when you first start going out it is more about all body touching, but the longer you are together the less you get all over caresses. "
Made noise. 
"Almost anything posted about periods - why we have them, why we can't control them (release all the blood at once, like a big poo), how we can pee while using a tampon or diva cup, etc... Makes me weep for our (lack of) sexual education.

"I commented offhandedly that I thought one of the lawyers at the firm I clerk at had a little crush on me. The next week he gave me a hilarious picture of himself kissing his flexed bicep - it had a very strong Johnny Bravo vibe - framed on a heart shaped picture frame and told me to put it on my desk at work. It was the cheesiest, funniest thing ever.  "
"When I was in college, a good friend of mine was dating a guy whose friends were primarily hipster types. Almost all of them were either vegetarians or vegans. They smoked cloves, used the word ""existentialist"" a lot, you know the type. We were talking to one of them and my friend asked if he was a vegan or just a vegetarian and he looked at her with absolute disgust and disdain and sneered ""Do I LOOK like someone who eats cheese?!""

That was like ten years ago and I still don't have a good response to that."
"One thing Reddit has taught me, is that some dudes are very misinformed about the amount of time women spend wishing they could be like men. 

I think of the pee thing only ever in specific outdoor situations. Like when you're on a road trip and have no choice but to pull over and pee beside a highway, but it's super awkward to make sure you're shielded and not putting your whole butt out for display to either cars or nearby farmhouses. 

At home? I've never once sat on the can and  wished I could stand."
"It is absolutely true.  And after he was slammed, he edited his post with a ""I can see no one here understands what I am talking about, so that proves I am right.""

"Yeah, I had a comment gilded there, saying I was born with my umbilical cord tied around my neck like a tie because I had been practicing."
"That adoption is always a good option as there are hundreds of families who want to adopt. 

My professional experience: There are plenty of people who want to adopt healthy, white newborn babies. MUCH less who want to adopt 8 &amp; 10 year old minority twins with FASD and a history of abuse.

YIPPI-KI-YAY MOTHERFUCKEEER!!!
"Haha I do this to my bf, except with grumpy pants. I'll also dramatically be like ""omg what's on your neck"" and feel all over his neck and then be like ""oh, wait nevermind is just your grumpy gills"""
"I don't think you understand how bras work. Or boobs.

Like.... have you ever actually *seen* a bra?!

The cup size can't be adjusted by tightening the band (or strap). That's like saying the length of your pants can be adjusted by using a belt.

**Edit:** I thought about it some more, and guys, he's **TOTALLY RIGHT**.

In fact, I've taken the liberty of drawing up a rough [concept design.](http://i.imgur.com/yMkAgae.jpg)

I think you can all agree this is the biggest breakthrough in bras since we shifted from ""pointy"" cup to ""round""."
"Something like ""Do girls really bleed from their vagina? I would be disgusted to see, it would make me lose my attraction to her.""

This was coming from a 20something European guy. His account was not new, didn't look like a trolling question."
"&gt; You're pretty for a black girl

You're friendly for a racist."
"I really struggle to orgasm with a partner. It hasn't happened with anyone in the past 8 years. I'm on a medication that makes orgasm more challenging. 

Whenever I tell men that I rarely cum, they immediately stop putting any effort in. No foreplay, no nothing. It's like I just become a sex doll. It really bothers me. Even if I don't get off I still enjoy it!"
"*How are you still single????*

A) Its more of a backwards compliment than anything because it assumes that I'm in a place where I should have no trouble finding a man, or that finding a man in general should be easy, yet somehow I'm unsuccessful.

B) It makes my singlehood seem like a defining characteristic and a problem.

"
"Just an honest, frank discussion. Focus on the way you're feeling rather than the things he/she does. It's ok to be needy sometimes, but talking about it in an honest way lets it come from a place of sincerity and vulnerability.

Use statements like ""I've been feeling lonely/isolated and I miss you, it would mean a lot if we could spend more time together, without video games/tv/other people."" Hopefully your SO loves and respects you enough to not dismiss that as needy or nagging."
"What always gets me about this one is when he says

&gt;What men consider to be ""love"" is the bond between two such entities, but men dont seem to be able to find this in women, why?

Just because *you're* lonely doesn't mean everybody else is, too. Have a look around, at all the people  that have ever been in a happy relationship! Do you really believe there are no husbands out there who love their wife (and know that she's a sentient being that loves them)? "
"I mentioned that he rarely buys me flowers and I wouldn't mind if he bought me some random ones now and then.  It became kind of a running joke for a couple months because apparently when we first started dating I wanted to seem romantically rebellious our whatever and told him I hated flowers because they were useless and died.  It had been several years since that statement and I matured and I wanted flowers now dammit. So one day I come home to a sack of flour, a cauliflower head, and a card saying ""now you can't say I never buy you flowers."" "
"I'm sitting here at work with my noisy coworkers, thinking how awesome it would be if I could ""close"" my ears and not hear anything as easily as I close my eyes so I can't see!"
"There are many more people that reluctantly come forward about sexual assault, and recant because they don't want to deal with the stresses of the trial than actively pursue verifiably false claims."
you are shitting me that a guy genuinely asked this
"Go to a professional and get a make over. You're probably not as unattractive as you think. Take care of your body, find out how to choose clothing that suits you. If for some reason you are unattractive even after putting in the effort, focus your energy on things other than looks and dating. There's a LOT to explore in this world and dating/marrying/having sex is over rated and the fun of it definitely fades over time. Study, travel the world, find other things that interest you and dedicate yourself to them. Looks fade, intelligence tends to last a bit longer. "
People are convinced there's a difference between a fracture and a broken bone. There isn't. One is medical terminology and one is how people commonly refer to it.
"Yes, I don't know you but I love you. I wish more men realized this. Our vaginas are meant to withstand a goddamn baby, your little penises aren't going to change anything, sorry."
i feel uncomfortable with compliments in general because i tend to not believe people when they compliment me. that's a me problem tho
"A guy in my program. Oh man. He'd been homeschooled his whole life, and was an only child to older parents and had had a team of nannies to raise him. It was very clear that any assignment he didn't want to do as a kid/teen, he just didn't, and his parents used to give him high marks just for existing.

He was so horrible. No matter what book or article you brought up, he claimed to have read it. Even if it was something I had made up just to mess with him. He pretended that he had no understanding of pop culture, denied ever watching movies, TV or pursuing the internet because he was 'above it.' He would constantly talk down to everyone about everything. He'd taken a single German class? Well now he was fluent and also an expert in German history. He was constantly 'correcting' people about things he knew nothing about. 

We had a language class together, and he ended up dropping it because we were learning the Modern version in this class, and he'd already done the Old (pre-1500) version, and the professor refused to accept his Old-version substitutions when he didn't know the correct answer. Of course she didn't! Why would she?! That makes no sense?!

The real kicker: he dropped every class (in humanities!) that required him to write a paper because he just 'didn't want to.' Finally, after 8 (!) years of full-time undergrad, his parents told him the gravy train was ending and his next year would be his last. Part of our degree was a mandatory dissertation, and he approached the program and asked them if they could just *give* him the credit, without him having to write the paper because he 'didn't want to do it,' and he felt that he had 'proved his ability' in the program enough that it was unnecessary. Obviously they said no. He refused to pick a topic, hated the topic that was chosen for him and refused to work on it. A month before it was due, he decided he was going to start working on a different topic without telling his supervisor. I have no idea if he finished, no idea if he graduated but he didn't show up the next year - thankfully."
"Ugh. ""You're pretty for a black girl"" I still haven't perfected a reply for that one besides just staring or not responding. I've even heard ""You have nice legs for a black girl.""

The absolute worst."
"Eye contact, noise, engagement, communication.

I lose interest and the sex gets super boring when it feel like my partner is not 100% in the moment and enjoying what I'm doing. I'm not gonna suck a dick for 20 minutes with no feedback or noise. That gets boring. A lot of the men that I have slept with are naturally quiet and focused on the mechanical parts of sex instead of really getting into it and savoring everything.


Best sex I have had had nothing to do with technique and everything to do with their intensity and how they made me feel like there is no one else on the earth they would rather be touching."
"I'm not sure if this is ""professional"" experience, but I'm not a moron so I know that a woman's vagina doesn't change magically due to the amount of partners she has (or even the amount of sex really, but the partners fallacy is more absurd).  People regularly point out that things go to shit there if you've been with 100 guys, like being with 1 guy 100 times is any different.  Even really smart guys I know always assumed this without questioning it.

Most people who are presented with the actual medical facts will be like ""Oh, yeah, that doesn't make sense now, does it?"" but I've argued with a few guys on Reddit who have done some impressive mental gymnastics to still believe that having multiple partners makes your vag ugly."
Or the girl starts moving more making it harder to continue to do what you are doing. 
"Dear Atlas_Mech,

I am so sorry. The experiment went wrong, and sent you, a perfectly innocent and unsuspecting passerby, back in time 300 million years. We are trying desperately to reverse this, but we're not even sure how it occurred. It may take several days at the very least, and honestly you're probably not going to survive that long. That does not mean we will not try. 

You will be buried a hero, that I promise you.

Now there are some things I should go over before you completely change the past - which you should NOT do! If you change the past then there is a chance that humanity will never exist, and you will be stuck there forever.

Rule 1: Please avoid lightning.

Rule 2: The only food you may have access to is algae or plankton. There is a chance you are not near a body of water, however, and I must stress the importance that you do not travel more then five square miles from where you currently stand - otherwise I cannot guarantee your return.

Rule 3: Collect samples of the dirt and rocks in your pockets. Not much is known about this period in earth's history.

Rule 4: Breathe slowly and shallowly. Oxygen is but 35%. Try not to panic. Hyperventilation is to be avoided.

Well, that's all I have for advice, seeing as we don't know much about this period.

Now for some assurances:

* Your cat is fed.
* The world has agreed to share the samples you bring back.
* We are in talks with the UN that you not be dissected for science upon your return under the premise that a first-hand description will be more valuable - so remember what you've seen.

You are in our thoughts and we are working tirelessly for your return. 

Safe travels,
Shady Scientist

Edit: Thanks for the gold!! Wowza!

Also, sorry for scientific inaccuracies, he was a shady scientist for a reason."
"He randomly starts dancing with me whenever there's (good) music playing. Doesn't matter where we are: supermarket, living room, middle of the sidewalk... he'll just grab me and we start to dance."

My SO and I found out that my great grandmother lived a block from where he grew up. I'd visit her often and we likely played together as children. He suddenly realized that this meant I probably met his mom who passed away about 11 years before he and I met. We both teared up and just sat hugging one another for a bit.

"He means basically that men are focused and have a continuous, rational line of thought.  So, I thought of A which made me consider B which made do C which then caused me to think D and so forth.  Whereas he thinks women have just random, scattered thoughts that are all unconnected and irrationally connected, if connected at all.

At least, that is my interpretation of it.  Who knows if I am right though?  I have just a silly, irrational woman brain to work with.  Oh, shiny object!"

"This argument from pro-lifers always pisses me off.

"That it's very difficult to make 100% of the proceeds from fundraising go directly to the mission itself as people are employed by nonprofits and need to survive.  

I also wish people understood how important it is that people in the nonprofit sector get paid a fair amount based on their knowledge and experience because I earn just under $35,000 annually and have only ever had contract-based work despite having  a lot of education and several years of experience.

"Actually pretty okay. I can generally look good in selfies on the first couple of tries, most of the time when strangers talk to me in public it is to ask for directions or to bum a cigarette and I'm still cute enough to find someone who's into my dumb face. 
I mean like I don't get free stuff or crazy amounts of compliments but sometimes cute baristas draw hearts instead of leaves in my lattes and on average people are pretty nice to me without being creepy. 
I excel in my mediocrity"

"It's just a very oblique phrasing of ""Why are all the attractive girls that I meet already in a relationship?""

1. If you're attracted to someone, chances are that other people will be too.
2. Maybe they're not in relationships, but prefer to *say* that they are when you're the one doing the asking."
The clean up after sex.
"They're like night and day different to me.  A lot of the pleasure from anal comes from a few things for me 1) the intimacy required for me to even be able to try it with a partner 2) the incredible amount of foreplay and stimulation, I need to make it work, I mean so much 3) the taboo of it, i kinda walk around the next day feeling like i have this dirty little secret.  I don't know that I've ever experienced a feeling of completeness from PIV.  It's nice, and I enjoy it, but it's pretty far from life changing for me at least.  If it was the only thing on the menu I'd lose interest pretty fast through, tbh.  "
"For my birthday, he acted like he was struggling too much with money to get me anything. He was apologetic and really sweet about it, and we had gone to a really nice dinner and stuff, so whatever... then he said he was going out to smoke really quick. Cool.

He came back in with this huge box, saying ""where did this come from?! I just found it outside!"" in the same voice you use to speak to a toddler when you find a coin behind their ear. It was adorable and made me cry, he had gotten something for me that we had looked at a month or two before, and I had dismissed as unreasonable.

He did something similar a couple years ago - he acted like he had bought me Disney Infinity (I have zero interest in it) so I was disappointed, but then I opened the box and he had gotten me a tablet. He's so corny but he makes me so happy. "
"I'm in grad school in the humanities, so there is no shortage of pretentiousness, but there was one guy who stood head and shoulders above the rest.

He smoked a pipe regularly, and had a smoking jacket.   He owned a huge shelf of fine liquors, where their quality helped to disguise the quantity, which really just reflected his penchant for morose alcoholism rather than good taste. Everything that came out of his mouth had an air of condescension that people seemed to mistake for wisdom, and he never missed an opportunity to drop a fifty-dollar word into a five-dollar conversation. 

He had a bachelors in Classics, and went to Yale law school before seeking out a doctorate in History, but he really only wanted to have a doctorate behind his name, the topic didn't actually matter to him (though when he did finally settle on a topic, it was duly pretentious: ""The perception of time and anachronism in Early Modern literature"", iirc. A good topic as a soundbite to tell people about in casual conversation, basically.) 

When he fell in love with a girl, he mooned over her for months, and when she turned him down he started writing her novels explaining how heartbroken he was. 

In the end, though, the pretension was mostly a mask for mental illness -- people ignored the alcoholism, the way he effectively harassed a woman for months, because it was covered in a veneer of intelligence and education. He dropped out after getting a diagnosis with BPD. "
"When we walk out of a mall or somewhere, and are walking to our car through the parking lot, he will often just yell out, ""I love this woman!""   It's cheesy and embarrassing but I do love it."
"I think the ""What do women think of a guy in medium wash blue jeans?"" post was fun."
"I had been sick for like three days, and gotten my period, so I had to run to the store and buy some tampons (and, IIRC, goldfish crackers and candy). I was wearing my fat sweats, a t-shirt with an unidentified stain, and looked greasy as fuck cause I hadn't showered. While standing in line with my unmentionables and shame, who walked in? My then-coworker that I had an enormous crush on, and two of his hot friends. He said something like, ""Oh hey... you look rough"", and I almost died on the spot. We still banged a few months later though. 

I also ran into one of my professors once while walking my dog in last night's makeup and outfit at like 7AM. I had to chat with him about my paper while wondering exactly how much of a raccoon situation I had going on (shortly thereafter discovered the answer was: a lot), and then had to sit through his class later that day."
"the tragic irony being, as soon as i hear those words, regardless of where i was i am now basically 5 seconds to orgasm myself and i've found that typically when a woman says 'im almost there' she's further away than a 5 count.

it's like 'don't look down' or 'don't touch that it's hot', if nothing was said i would probably last longer but once you say 'don't cum' -- boom goes the dynamite. apparently it's the sexiest thing i could ever hear. so im mostly in a situation where i either mildly upset her by changing up a few times but working her back up to orgasm or really piss her off when i try to hold out, fail, ejaculate and leave her high and dry. 

i find it's safer (read: less embarrassing for me) to just not even try, do the best i can then switch to oral and finish her that way."
I had a guy tell me recently that I'd lost all agency as a sexual being because I hadn't shaved my legs in 2 days and thus had some stubble.

I think her point was that sex is still enjoyable even if orgasm is impossible. Rather than looking for a new route try to make sure she enjoys the journey.

"that dude just like yesterday who had a post history full of things like ''all my former friends think i'm a sociopath they're all wrong y/y'' ''why do people get mad when you say you're not attracted to fat chicks'' and ''how come you get mad at dudes watching you at the gym when all we want to do is concern troll about your improper form or oogle you i can't really decide myself''

and then he was like ''ladies please help an inexperienced male become aware of the red flags he might be putting up.''"
"Don't give up.

I'm reading Amy Poehler's book right now and two paragraphs stand out as good advice for a situation possibly similar to your's.  She put it together better than I could right now...

""If you are lucky, there is a moment in your life when you have some say as to what your currency is going to be.  I decided early on it was not going to be my looks.  I have spent a lifetime coming to terms with this idea and I would say I am about 15 to 20 percent there.  Decide what your currency is...let go of what you will never have. People who do this are happier and sexier.""

""Hopefully as you get older, you start to learn how to live with your demon.  It’s hard at first.  Some people give their demon so much room that there is no space in their head or bed for love.  They feed their demon and it gets really strong and then it makes them stay in abusive relationships or starve their beautiful bodies.  But sometimes, you get a little older and get a little bored of the demon.  Through good therapy and friends and self-love you can practice treating the demon like a hacky, annoying cousin.  Maybe a day even comes when you are getting dressed for a fancy event and it whispers, “You aren’t pretty,” and you go, “I know, I know, now let me find my earrings.”  Sometimes you say, “Demon, I promise you I will let you remind me of my ugliness, but right now I am having hot sex so I will check in later.” 

Just don't give up."
Not on Reddit. But the other day my bf cleaned my apartment while I was at work to help me out. He ended up doing my laundry. After I came home he asked me what the pouch in women's underwear was. He was completely serious and so confused. It took me a while to understand that he meant the cotton liner. I've never laughed so hard in my life. 
See I've heard that theory and I think it's bullshit. Pretty sure women masturbate quietly too especially when living at home or with roommates. Yet I think most of us can get over that and give partners feedback. 
Those also tend to be the types of people who want to reduce all government funding for that kind of situation

"Too much sex (with too many different penises?) stretches the vagina out, making it loose, and/or giving you big labia. Because they're scar tissue."
"I think that the key is that when you are vulnerable and need help from your SO, that is completely normal.  You have a need, and you're asking for their help to meet your needs, and if they love you and care about you, they should want to be there for you when you need them.

But if you are relying on your partner to meet your basic needs on a regular basis, that's what being ""needy"" is.  In healthy adult relationships, people generally take care of their own needs, split 50/50 shared responsibilities, enjoy the time they spend with eachother, and only actually rely on the other person to meet their needs in situations that are actually unusually stressful or bad in an out of the ordinary way.

I think that sometimes, when one person has more needs for socialization, validation, or stimulation than their partner does, but for whatever reason doesn't want to fulfill those needs on their own, they can get into a mode where they want more attention from their partner than their partner is comfortable giving.  Sometimes, instead of having that conversation about ""you feel zonked and want to be by yourself, and I feel lonely and want to hang out with you how should we handle this"", they just find themselves regularly in crisis mode, where they ""need"" the other person to help them, so their need trumps the other person's want.  And that's when it gets emotionally manipulative and ""needy""."

However, because a lot of that research is considered proprietary to the industries funding it, very little of it is available to the public and I can't publish or discuss the majority of it without breaking nondisclosure agreements. It's incredibly frustrating at times. "

"Last year we couldn't spend Christmas together, since our families live in different countries.
On the 25th of December however he flew 3h from his city to mine, landed at 8PM, spend the night, and took the plane back at 7AM in the morning to have lunch with his family. 
He surprised me with it. Best Christmas ever. 

And our christmas gifts were the same: we both made a memory book to each other. He has dyslexia which makes handwriting quite difficult for him, but he still wrote ""our story"" by hand. He wanted to make an effort for me. I still melt when I think about it.

He had the nerve to ask me why I bothered going to college because he never saw me studying.

"As an unattractive man, my advice is that if you are interested in finding an SO, don't look at online dating as your primary source of potentials.

Online dating is really really really heavily skewed towards physical attractiveness. I'm not saying it doesn't ever work for people who aren't attractive but IMO it's much harder. And so if you've tried it and haven't found much luck, you're not alone. It's also easy to feel like shit being rejected over and over again on a platform by dozens of people.

Instead, look into joining a hobbyist club, like Toastmasters, a recreational sports league, a social meetup... something that meets up weekly so that you can slowly get to know people and they can get to know you. I found it incredibly helpful at building self-esteem and getting to expand my friends network. It's helped with the whole attractiveness thing. Having interests that you are passionate/knowledgeable about makes you a more attractive person. And going to more social things outside of your daily routine increases the likelihood of meeting someone."
"That's adorable!! I kind of have a similar story; I always wanted flowers but never wanted to tell my now husband to get them for me. One year for my birthday or something, I finally looked at him and said, ""Y'know, sometimes girls like it when you buy them flowers!""

Two years into dating, on my birthday, he proposes with an engagement ring he had his dad (jeweler) design to look like a sunflower. He tells me, ""Now you can't ever say I don't get you flowers!""

Edit: [here's my ring](https://imgur.com/gallery/syXSE), if anyone's interested. "

&gt;Best sex I have had had nothing to do with technique and everything to do with their intensity and how they made me feel like there is no one else on the earth they would rather be touching.

"I don't work in the field, but I witnessed this process first hand when someone really close to me brought their assaulter to trial and it was one of the most painful and upsetting things I've had to witness...and I was just there for support. The trial took several years and she basically had to put her life on hold. It tore her family apart, she lost friends, dropped out of uni because it was too stressful and became severely depressed. The worst was probably having to watch her sit up on the stand and tell her story in detail, go over it again and again and watch the defense attorney pull it all apart and throw it back in her face. And then, of course, the assaulter was found innocent and the only consolation is that maybe next time he will actually be found guilty if another person is willing to take him to court. Sadly, it's not a matter of if he has assaulted others, it's a matter of whether or not they ever come forward and after witnessing what she went through, I wouldn't blame the others for never coming forward.

The sensation of fullness is like a craving that is satisfied with piv or fiv (fingers). With anal I don't have the craving to be filled but the sensation of stretching and fullness is awesome with anal. So it's more like piv satisfies a craving while anal is like a bonus pleasure.

"This is not much of a researchable issue, but I notice it daily: Humans are *terrible* at asking questions in a manner that is conducive to obtaining the information they actually want. I regularly have to sit around with multiple smart people who do nothing else all day and puzzle over what it is that highly educated, successful businesspeople are trying to ask us. I think we all tend to believe that we're clear communicators ourselves, so this can be a humbling experience. 

Some will ask the same question in three places, leaving the respondent to figure out from surrounding questions that they're actually trying to ask for/about totally different things. Some will ask questions that aren't based on any quantifiable, shared external metrics (""do you do this adequately? Is this useful?""), basically ensuring that they will obtain no useful information from any response. Some will ask three different questions at once, often ending with a yes/no one - actively making it hard for the respondent to give them a useful answer to all three. And basically nobody proofreads enough, no matter how much they get paid for the document. 

My current fantasy business model is to go around teaching corporate teams how to ask a question so they'll get a good answer. I plan on charging fantastical money for this service, but I have no real illusions that it'll help much. "
"Oh god wait I have another. Back in grad school I lived in Westwood where they do a bunch of movie premiers. One random evening I was feeling like treating myself and I decided to get my lazy ass out of bed and walk to the store to grab some snacks. I wore sweatpants and no make up.  I went in and was in the store for a while being indecisive. 
When I stepped out of the store, I saw Katy Perry. She was in a gorgeous floor length dress that sparkled as she walked and she looked sexy af. I was holding a GALLON of chocolate milk and hot pockets, in sweatpants, on a public street corner. "

"My best guy friend said the hottest thing a girl can wear is a t-shirt and sweatpants. But what I think it really means is, he likes girls who are effortlessly hot.

What I didn't know was my aunt had booked us a nice breakfast at a pretty nice restaurant. She wouldn't let me go home and change as I acted like such a brat that morning. So everyone is sitting at breakfast looking decent, except for me. I was wearing purple polka dot pj pants and a tank top, unbrushed hair, unwashed face. It was bad. I've never gone out in pj's since."

She tried explaining that she doesn't take the non-active pills, and he put her on hold to talk to the pharmacist about it because he didn't understand why she would skip an entire week. Should also mention that this guy has worked in a pharmacy for quite a while already. Made me laugh, but also made me wonder how he is getting accepted to medical school. "

Don't get me wrong; neither of them are great people to begin with, but them together just magnifies every character flaw they could possibly have, and seems to cause them nothing but problems. 

Plus, the entire relationship was founded on Ross's unhealthy teenage obsession over the girl who was 'out of his league'. That's a recipe for disaster."

"Your question, as it's worded, makes no sense.  Adjusting the straps on a bra won't make it fit a different size breast.  

If what you're actually asking is why cup sizes have to be in proportion to band sizes rather than the cup and band being independent measurements - like why can't a C cup just be a constant size breast on any size body - that's not an unreasonable question.  The answer is that it makes for easier and more precise fitting to have the cup be determined by the difference in bust and underbust measurements.

And even though bra *bands* usually have a few sets of hooks on them, they aren't ""adjustable"" the way, say, drawstring pajama bottoms are adjustable.  It seems like you want to reduce the number of band sizes, but that wouldn't work.  I wear a 32 band.  Adding a few more hooks to a 34 to make it tighter wouldn't make the bra fit me properly.  The band needs to fit really well because it - not the straps - provides most of the support for the breasts.  Trying to replace band numbers with s/m/l/etc doesn't make any sense (the numbers work fine and are more precise) and wouldn't have any benefits.  

Stop trying to ""fix"" something that you don't understand.  It's not the way you think it should be for good reason."

"Asked a couple friends about that once. One said if a woman looks good to him dressed down, he knows she'll look good dressed up. And, he likes women who are comfortable running out of the house without much fuss.

"I knew I was an addict the second I started drinking (age 17). My intention from the beginning was to drink every day so I could deal with things easier. My mom was dying of cancer, and I couldn't stand hearing her scream and cry all night, along with the blood and gore. 

But I didn't realise how quickly your tolerance increases. Just a year later, I was drinking grown men under the table. By age 24 I had to have 3 double shots of vodka right when waking up, and I'd be seeing double by 2pm, then I'd pass out and do cocaine and meph and drink about a litre of vodka until 4am. 

By then my mom was dead, which theoretically meant I didn't have to worry anymore. But I'd developed chronic stomach pain and I had to keep drinking to feel normal. And I was drinking so much that I had to do drugs to keep me awake.

I got sober at 24, I'm 28 now. The stomach pain is still there and doctors have given up on figuring it out. It's getting harder and harder to stay sober, because, as Kurt Cobain put it (he also had a stomach thing that he self-medicated), ""I feel like a junkie anyway"".

But, I don't think I will relapse. It's just getting harder. 

Note, just because things like Netflix and food don't kill you instantly, doesn't mean they're not serious addictions. A lot of people have the exact same craving as I did for alcohol, only for junk food, and it can result in morbid obesity. And a lot of people think they've recovered, when it's just been transferred into an addiction for something that seems ""good"" (working out, obsession with healthy eating, AA, spirituality, their career, etc.). We have to recognise that addiction is serious even when it's not substance abuse. Avoiding feelings will lead to chaos no matter what. "

"Truth. My fiance was working as a chef for a really nice restaurant, very good quality food and wine, very high prices. Last winter he got really sick, like a really bad flu. He had terrible cold sweats, a bad fever, he could barely even stand. Diarrhea and vomiting. I'm not sure you could be much sicker. His boss told him that if he called in a sick day that he would be fired. Not only that, but he made him work 14 hour shifts two days in a row. I know that people must have gotten sick from eating that food. There's no way, even though I know how careful he is, that he didn't contaminate something.

That guy was a POS. I know the  restaurant industry is hardcore, but that was just ridiculous. I was so glad when he quit. "

"It's really eye opening to see Cosby, Trump, and Ghomeshi (just to name a few) serve no time for multiple incidents of sexual assault despite dozens of victims.

I find a lot of men I've slept with will be really tentative about touching my pussy, undressing me, or going down on me at first, I basically have to guide them there myself or be very explicit verbally and tell them what I'd like them to do. Obviously I don't wanna get pounced on from the get-go (at least not with a new partner), but it's like, dude, you're in my bed with me and my clothes are off - as long as your last name isn't Trump, you absolutely have permission to grab my pussy.

"I can't find it now, but awhile ago a woman told a story on Twitter I think about an American elected politician she worked for, who used to rage about the cost of keeping menstrual products in the women's bathrooms. One day he finally refused to let her go to the bathroom when she started her period, insisting she stay and work.

She was like ""I have to, or else I'll bleed everywhere."" She said the guy's eyes got wide and he was like ""what do you mean?""

Turns out he thought women could control bleeding, like how we do with urination. So he thought women needing to go to the bathroom during their periods was just them goofing off and avoiding work, and that tampons and pads were just so we could be lazy. 

Apparently she had to sit and explain menstruation to this middle-aged man. After that he was much more understanding.

I really wish I could find her original story, it was unreal."

"I have no idea if people mean this as a compliment when they say it: ""You look so young!""

I get it. Looking young is seen as being prettier than looking old. But when they say it to me, they don't mean it like ""Wow, you're 40? I never would have guessed! You don't look a day over 29!"" They mean, ""You're 25? But you look 14!""

It is NOT complimentary to be told you look like an adolescent when you have been a fully grown adult for quite some time."
To set a few things straight. I didn't mean to keep anybody out. I simply did not think about the question in that way. I was innocently asking women because that's what directly applies to me. As I am a hetero male that was curious to know if there are things that I could do more of. It would be foolish of me to think I know everything and I figured this was a perfect place to broaden my horizons. Different situations apply to different people I understand that. I hope I did not offend anyone as that is not my goal. I hope we can continue this great conversation as I and maybe others are finding this educational.

"Acetaminophen or Motrin. The children's version for kids of course. These are fever reducers. Drinking lots of cold water helps as well because the cold temperature cools your body and it hydrates you. Drinking Pedialyte helps too to replenish electrolytes. Putting a fan on in the room helps. And a cool wash rag or something on the forehead. Check temperature every hour or so. If after all this, the fever still hasn't broken and it's been hours, head to an urgent care or an ER. 

Fevers happen because your body is working super hard to fight something off and the by-product is excessive heat basically. Makes no sense to force more heat on your body when it's already trying to cool itself off. Help your body to cool itself, not make it more hot. "

"I was 17 and he was 24.  He was very charming at first. He adored me but he depended on me for too much though.  One day I said something sassy and he slapped me across the face.  He apologized profusely and I forgave him.  Next time it was a choking. Then several more incidents, each time followed by his promises to never do it again.  Well I'm not dumb. I can see this will never change.  I tried to break up with him numerous times and he threatened suicide and I would feel sorry for him. The last time, he held me hostage in his room, holding a razor to his wrist.  I talked my way out of there by promising to still be his girlfriend.  Then I resolved to dump him, he would call and plead and threaten suicide. I told him to go ahead.  One night he was waiting for me to come home.  I locked my car doors but the passenger side  malfunctioned.  As he opened it and reached for me, I jumped out my side and ran to the house.  Just as I got the door open he dove in after me and grabbed my leg.  I screamed which woke up my Dad and older brother and they hollered and he ran down the street. My dad got a baseball bat and my brother grabbed his cuestick and I was telling them that he was crazy and then he called out from the shadows that maybe it was me.  My dad said you son of a bitch I will kill you if you ever come around my daughter again.  So then I didn't hear from him but a few days later when I went to school, I tried to stop my car and the brakes failed.  I had to use the emergency brake to stop.  Turns out that he cut my brake line.  Then a few weeks later my wheel came off because the lug nuts had been loosened.  That was the last thing though. I assume he lost interest because he found another target. I know this sounds weird but  I felt guilty after that. Like I failed,  like I should have taken him out so that no other girl would have to go through that.  It was pretty fucked up to have to go through that at that age.  The irony of the whole thing was that my dad told me from the get go that Terry was crazy, he could see it in his eyes.  But what does dad know, right. God I was so hard headed."

"There's usually a second layer of fabric on the inside crotch part of women's panties. Since it's not always sewn on all four sides (the front is sometimes open) it can look like a pouch. It's really there as an extra layer between you and your clothes, as women have (totally normal and healthy) vaginal discharge during the day. The extra fabric helps absorb it and prevents the high-ph level of discharge from bleaching our panties or pants.  I'm sure someone could explain better but this was always my understanding of why we have that extra layer. "

"I started out as a Japanese major in college and joined a group for it where everyone in said group follows the same curriculum together. So we all became friends.

One of our classes was a Japanese Literature course that we did writing projects for, one of which was haikus. So this guy writes one (that he didn't turn in) about me as an attempt to flirt, where he compares me to a fully ripened peach. Which sounds weird on its own but peaches (maybe elsewhere too) in Japan are kind of used to symbolize the female genitals so that just made it ten times worse. This was after insisting I should kiss him because earlier that week, in our speaking class, we practiced a scenario where two people are on a date and one asks for a kiss and the other refuses. And he and I had been paired up for that one.

My friends and I just kind of laughed awkwardly and he never tried something like that again."

"It has happened a few times, and I always trust my instinct on it. 

A notable example is from when I was like 17, volunteering in my mother's classroom after school. There was a parent that always weirded me out. She seemed totally normal, totally polite, but she just made the hairs on my arms stand on end. Her husband was a really nice guy, but he had brittle bones of some kind and was disabled. Constantly had broken bones, poor guy.

A few years later she took her wheelchair-bound husband's wheelchair away, doused him in gasoline, took her kid by the hand and walked him out the door trailing fuel behind her, and then lit it up. Burned down the house with her husband in it, and held her son's hand and made him watch. 

Another example is a friend's husband. He just made my skin crawl, and I did not like him. We were all supposed to spend the day at the fair together - her family, and another friend's family, and me, but something about him just set me on edge, so I skipped out. 

Found out a few months ago he'd been abusing his children after one of them ended up in the hospital. I had a hand in reporting it, because she was too afraid to say anything, so he wrote a thirty-six page screed about how the influences of a single woman like myself (clearly demonic, because I am single, over 30, and still leave the house on occasion) have corrupted his wife, and how she had to be purified of my evil influences, and how any woman who is 30 and without children is Godless and a bride of Satan. Worst part is, he's in the military, has access to a lot of guns, and isn't currently in jail for his crimes.  I've lost sleep over that one, recently. 

Instincts are probably just be us reading micro-expressions and picking up on subtle clues subconsciously - things we can realize are wrong, but not quite put our fingers on. "

"Dude, it's pretty fucking obvious she wants you to fuck the floor."
"Exactly this. I love that I feel comfortable enough with my partner to do it, and I love that he enjoys it. It feels so hot that we do something dirty and break boundaries. But it's NOTHING like penetrative sex in the vagina and nowhere near as good. It also feels like you need to poo lol. But I do enjoy it all the same 😂"
A friend told me this once to warn against the dangers of masturbation... because then you bond with yourself and can never truly love anyone. 
That you can go from ass to pussy all the time with no health consequences.
"For our second Valentine's, he made me a mix tape. I was so happy...until I got home and discovered it was Wonderwall 14 times in a row with All-Star in the middle. Still was pretty happy. Best prank ever."
"Maybe you're trans and haven't realized it yet? This is your wake up call. You've been living a lie.

I'd look into it."
"I don't hear it super often, thankfully, but guys who say ""your husband is a really lucky guy"" or some variation, especially if they don't know my husband. It's creepy, I feel like it really means ""I want you and the person who can have you is lucky"""
Being unwilling to believe that women go through things that are a basic part of the human experience because those things happen also happen to men. 
I mean... is there even a point to reading fanfiction that isn't?
Plus adopting is freaking expensive. 
"That lock and key metaphor about women having ""too many"" sexual partners. "
"My SO will literally just drape herself in my lap, or pounce on me. At *worst*, I might get annoyed for a second, but it always makes me laugh.

She's always been very upfront with me, and I love it. No guesswork. She just lets me know what she needs."
"That if a man is in a relationship, he's ""whipped"" or somehow under the thumb of his female SO. 

My boyfriend bought a couple new shirts and his friends' instant reaction was ""oh, so she's dressing you now?"" No. I wasn't even there when he bought them. He just bought some new fucking shirts and it never even would've been brought up in conversation if he were single. 

I even find my boyfriend himself slipping into this mindset every now and then despite that not being the climate of our relationship at all. He called me last week while I was at work to ask if he could hang out with his friend that night. Like really? I'm not your mommy, you can do whatever the fuck you want. I'd appreciate a heads up so I know to make plans with someone, too, but there's no need to ask for permission. "
Or better yet: You have good taste for a racist.
"Netflix binge. 

A good book, soothing music, incense, soothing lotion, a warm blanket, and some hot chocolate.

Or attempt a new record of consecutive orgasms /masturbation sessions?"
That lesbians are only lesbians because they haven't met the right penis yet. 
"My boyfriend fibbed to friends about how I dragged him to yoga with me so he could save face and I let it go, when he really invited himself (and really enjoyed it.) "
He could also be one of those logic bots that lack empathy so they only process information that they've directly experienced.   Men like that can be bullheaded and narcissistic more than logical I'd say.
"Everyone masturbates, you're not curing cancer. I honestly gag a little whenever someone says ""for science"". "
"When we visited my home town, I insisted on getting us places by memory rather than looking at maps. Most times, I would end up taking random turns and occasionally I had to backtrack. I am also constantly late. 

My SO made up a silly song with the bits and pieces of my native language that he knew about how I was getting us lost and I was terrible at getting us places on time. He would sing this grammatical nightmare, out of tune, with his thick English-speaker accent, grinning happily as I drag him by the hand in a foreign city. 

I love him to pieces."
"I love that he's so confident of this clearly objectively true fact that describes the existence of all men, when most men I know would have the same reaction as women: ""what the fuck are you talking about, dude?"""
"hahaha I'm sorry, but that made me laugh! 

I guess that's better than looking sick and in pain? Maybe? "
I feel like she is trying to sound appealing to women while massively oversimplifying a concept to the point it is almost insulting.

"I find Tony Stark hilarious, witty, and fun to watch. But if I met him, I know I'd find him to be an insufferable egomaniac. What does Pepper see in him?"
"Single mother? Woman on welfare who should keep her legs closed.

Single father? *What a sweet man.* He's being so *responsible*.

Or even just seeing a father spending time with his kids. How *amazing.* But a mother spending time with her kids? Can she get her kids under control please?

Dude... they're *parents.* It's insulting to both genders, the automatic assumption that men aren't going to take an interest in their kids and women are totally irresponsible and overwhelmed."
"Seriously. I read a lot of plays to find audition material and about 90% of the monologues written for women have something to do with: 
1. A romantic relationship 
2. My va-gay 
3. Pushing out babies 
4. They say I can't do x because I'm a woman, but I'll show them! 
5. I'm not pretty-- blerp a derp


Can't I just talk about how freaked out I am about death for once? How unfulfilled I am at my job? How people talking up the entire sidewalk need to be banished to their own circle in hell? "
"People not just leaving their fiancé(e) for someone they just met or a ""friend"" that had been waiting around for them for years."
"It was a woman. I had a class about Islam and there were quite a few muslims in the class as well. That was super interesting, they could tell how the theories related to their own experiences. Except that one girl who would constantly - after another of the muslim students told about their experiences - would say ""but thats not real islam"" and would follow with her own experience about the subject. She was the only person in the room who apparently could not comprehend that there were different streams of islam and that because her family did not believe in djinns no muslim would (as an example). 

In my christianity class we had a similar girl - devoutly protestant and every interpretation her pastor gave of the bible was the only correct one. "
"I was going to say this. Having a sense of style, dressing well and putting in effort goes a really long way."
"Sounds like the libertarian who always wore top hats in my poli sci classes.

SERIOUSLY. TOP HATS."
"Yea, I follow this donkey rescue group and they always make a big to do over saying how no one gets paid. While that's cool that they can handle being all volunteer I hate when they mention it. Nonprofits with paid employees aren't a scam and shouldn't be judged as lesser."
That doctors will let you die if they find out you are an organ donor
"Same! And while I like book Harry/Ginny as a couple they are a terrible couple in the movie, mostly because movie Ginny is nothing like book Ginny. "
"I mean, if you redefine losing your virginity as ""achieving orgasm by stimulation from another person,"" it seems like most STRAIGHT women must be virgins!"
"You are to pretty to be gay/good at math/be dating the person you are/hanging out where you want to/wear all that makeup.

NONE OF THESE THINGS ARE RELATED."
