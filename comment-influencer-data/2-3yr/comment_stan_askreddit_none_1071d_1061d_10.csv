"A kid in my middle school went on a booze cruise through his parent's liqueur cabinet, and ended up bringing some Grey Goose to school in a big clear water bottle. He passed it around to all of his friends, and they pretended to act drunk all day. A teacher caught on, and the school was PISSSED. Kid ended up expelled, and a lot of his friends were suspended. The entire 8th grade had to sit through a three hour assembly about why alcohol was evil. We too lost our field trip to D.C. 

Fuck you Stan 

Edit: I forgot how to do, a, comma"
