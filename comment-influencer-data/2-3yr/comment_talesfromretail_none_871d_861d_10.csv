"Gold! I've got a regular that doesn't speak a word, but we're all waiting for the day that he reveals that he speaks perfect English."
He seems like a well adjusted citizen
"What a bitch! Did she really think a paid service would be free, simply because it's something that can be done faster? By that logic, I shouldn't have to pay anything for a car wash, because they're usually fast, or going through a check out line that's really fast. Why do people think this way???"
..My mom did the same with stanky leg. 
So rude that he didn't remember that you weren't there. What an idiot. 
was... was he just trying to sound smart asking for a reciept?
"More importantly, who gets pissed off about $4?"
He thought he just got gas for free and still had an entirely unused gift card. Because no one ever told him how they work apparently??
"I had some lady get pissed over a penny. I work at a furniture store and our computer system is pretty out of date (the owner won't invest in a new one). It has some minor glitches. One of those glitches is that 1 out of a 100 tickets will either undercharge or overcharge a penny. Some lady came in waving her receipt at me and wanted her penny. Me, knowing the stupid amount of effort to go back in and re-key the ticket and hope that the new one wasn't another 1 in a 100, reaches into my desk and gives her a nickel. She says she doesn't want that nickel. She wants a penny from the register. She says I'm trying to steal from the company by giving her a nickel from my desk. She says that I will give a penny from the register and she will call our corporate office and file a complaint against me (we have no corporate office and the owner is one of my best friends) I look at her, sit down and re-key her ticket as slowly as I can. A full half hour later, I get up, walk her new ticket to her, have her re-sign all the appropriate lines, open the register and give her the moldiest penny I could find. She smiles and thanks me and fucks off, while I think of how much gas she used coming to argue a penny and how rude she was to a complete stranger who has her home address."
"That can't be worse than the socially awkward guy who rented an apartment in a complex and faked being mute so he didn't have to interact with the guys at the reception desk. 

Except the receptionists took pity on him and learned some basic sign language, and one evening they surprised him by signalling. What happened next was probably as awkward as being set up on a blind date with your sister. He moved out the next month."
"I scream
You scream.
We all scream because the manager won't give me free ice cream."
"Nah, he's a little off. Just put the rest of him back and scoop another dude for us for free."
"""I want to use somebody else's employee discount""

lol no. Thats not how any of this works."
Holy crap that's one hell of a story. It never ceases to amaze me what people will try. Sounds like something that should be on America's Dumbest Criminals 
"Ah, the good old Quick - Cheap - Good trio.

Some folks never learned to pick two."
"Why didn't she just ask someone to call her phone? Then again, I would have denied her my phone after treating me like that."
"&gt;They can only drive if they're on ambulance business. Did you know that?

Yes. Yes I did. 

Because I'm not totally oblivious to everything except my own needs."
"&gt; L: ""This is fucking ridiculous, I'm late for work and I need to get out of here""

Ahh yes, I too always do my grocery shopping on my way to work!"
"Who even knows, man... My brain isn't equipped for his brand of mental gymnastics lol."
I would have just dropped dead.
"Reminds me of ""What the Deaf Man Heard,"" where the kid grows up and everybody thinks he's a deaf/mute because he acts like it, and when he grows up and becomes Matthew Modine, people say things around him that they wouldn't normally say, secrets, etc. The big shock at the end when he reveals he can hear after all..."
"In IT we get similar complaints sometimes. The trick is to point out that the customer isnt just paying you to press the button, but to know which button to press."
"I had a guy the other day wanting to buy a sat nav (GPS) we had at Â£110. He told me 1 of our competitors had it for Â£60. The look on his face when I went to the computer, loaded up their website and showed him the same sat nav on their website was Â£130. I offered to price match for him and put the price up by Â£20, he paid Â£110."
"I was listening to a podcast once and the lady running it described a similar story, except she worked at a bank.

Some old guy was getting all pissy at the teller becuase they're required to ask for ID to access the account. Then the old guy went on a tirade about how he's been a loyal customer for years and years and that everyone who works there should know him.

Eventually the teller covered up her name tag and asked, ""Who am I?"" Apparently that was enough, becuase he stammered for a bit, then shut up, and left."
But it kinda sounds like he thinks all cards work like that to me.  
"The lack of self-awareness is what gets me.  ""You could have gotten my kid killed."" 

Like no dude YOU would have gotten your kid killed because you were too busy being an effing nutball *in front of your poor kid* because you wanted to either save a few $$$ or whatever the point of that was.  He basically freaked his kid out for no reason too. What an asshat!!! "
We work retail. We're all unstable. You have to be to survive in this environment. 
"They take her off politely?

Like some kind of kind hitman?"
Apparently I'm old because I don't know what this is.
"Title made me think I was on r/jokes ...

I was pleasantly surprised!"
"No response, he just froze for a second then left. Why should he apologise? Don't you know the customer is always right? ðŸ™„"
"You scream.
I scream.
The police get called.
It's awkward."
"The end nailed something I think about all the time. I work for a cell phone carrier and occasionally think about how reckless it is of people to piss me off and threaten me etc once I'm in their account. I have your home address, email, cell numbers, and the ability to interrupt your service or cancel your number altogether. I could go as far as resetting your online login and taking control of the account later if I really wanted to. I have so much information available to me that maybe you should reconsider all the things you say while you're angry"
It looks like the motion of someone sneezing into their elbow. I'm not sure where it comes from.
"So his child's life is worth the price of a small cherry ice cream? I'm frightened at the thought of that child going home with this man, especially because most parents know kids will chase stuff into traffic and don't risk their kid's life to make a cheap point to a fast food place. I really, really wish there had been a cop nearby when this happened."
"""Sir, not to worry. We have the fastest-writing computers out of any of our competitors! I assure you, although it doesn't seem possible, the computer in the pump has definitely written the transaction to the records. They're very fast!"""
[removed]
I would've call a different number than the one she gave me.
"Ha, the ambulance comment was my favourite part because I had a beautiful image of this poor neighbour being confronted by this woman. 

""Can I borrow your ambulance? It's for a cardboard tree I want."" "
"""Don't call me ma'am. I'm not black!""

How...? Like... HOW?"
Just call a friend and start casually chatting about how this lady lost her phone. 
"I think OP was being super nice, and actually offering the customer all three..."
"I'm really glad this wasn't a story about a trucker hitting on you.

He's still a donkey's rear end though."
I hope you come back with an update.
Something about this paragraph makes me think you are really unstable.
"From some reason, I read it as your manager responded with, ""I want to speak to YOUR manager,"" to the lady. "
I'm going to pretend a hypermarket is a supermarket but with lasers and flying cars.
I wonder if he really thought you would change the price to $20. Nice try though.
"You wanted her to think. Clearly, that was not an option for her, not even with your help."
"I worked at a Chinese restaurant for years. The cooks sometimes spoke English, sometimes they didn't - they rotated frequently. At one time, we had this young cook, never spoke a word to me, regardless of what I did or said. He was with us for months, but after about a week of him ignoring me, I figured he didn't speak any English. So I go about my business, assuming he can't understand me, talk to myself, sometimes forget and talk to him, etc. One day, I'm packing up an order and I'm missing a dish, without missing a beat he says, ""Here's the orange chicken."" Perfect English, and not even a slight fucking accent. I just looked at him and said, ""You fucker."" He thought it was hilarious. I have to give it to him though, I'm not sure how he kept it going for so long. "
"That would be taking her *out* politely.

""Excuse me, Ma'am, I'm terribly sorry to inconvenience you, but you seem to have upset someone with money and connections, and he has ordered to have you removed from the pool of people he could potentially encounter. I am sorry for having taken up so much of the rest of your precious time, and I hope the remaining seconds are not too uncomfortable for you. Have a nice day, Ma'am."" "
nice karma from the retail gods
"Heaven forbid she goes to a specialty boba place. They ask how sweet, flavors, mix-ins, toppings..."
Omg. Did he say anything afterwards? Your response felt so good to read lol.
My mom never embarrassed me like this when we went shopping together. It was the other way around. I once puffed a plastic produce bag and quietly stuck it over her pony tail and she unknowingly walked around with it on for a good half hour. I think she just knew I would always get her back if she did something like that when I was a kid.
"That's funny, because if you buy two pairs of jewelry pliers and a pack of jump rings, it can come to about $30+... Makes $4 sound like a bargain! "
"Sir, you only have 5 spoonfuls of dude left. You cannot get another one for free."
But what if she tried to follow suit and drop it low
"Even if he's a druggie or a drunk - he's still a human being. You certainly did the right thing, he probably will never forget your kindness. "
"Sassy customer behind her ""HE SAID, stop swiping your damn card!""

This right here^^^ had me lol"
"I work at a liquor store and I love explaining to adults that if I ask for an ID and they can't give me one or the one they give me is expired, I can't sell to them. Doesn't matter if they're regulars or obviously old enough. If we ask they need to have a valid ID end of conversation. 

So keep your IDs valid and on you!"
"I have watched people try to check out with gift cards they took from the rack when they entered the store.

Those people probably vote."
"Ugghhh tell me about it.

One of the fastest things I do at my shop is putting a new slider on a jacket zipper. Since I've been doing it for so long (like, 11 years) I can find a new slider that will work almost immediately and get the job done in like 2min. ... I still charge $9.99. Since I can do it so fast, I do it while the customer waits and I don't ring it up as a 'right away' job (which adds an extra 40%). Sure the part only costs me $0.25 from my supplier... but you are paying me to do something that you don't know how to do, don't have the parts to do, and for the convenience. No complaining! Plus, the last owner used to charge $14.99!

I'm so sick of hearing ""That's it? I could have done that!!"" and ""Can you just sell me the slider and I'll do it?"""
Wrong dab 
"Love it. Especially that the second customer jokingly asked for a discount, and got one. "
"I am the mother of a tween. He and his friends are a bunch of idiots when they're together, including dabbing. I long to do something to embarrass him this much. 

The only thing I've come up with thus far is singing ""let it go"" very loudly at him. His response makes my day shine brighter. Mwa ha ha"
