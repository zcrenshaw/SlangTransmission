He speaks the truth.
Someone must have told your brother that the library was open. 
The smaller dating pool.
"Easier to understand your SO, no risk of pregnancy, not having to be the persuer/initiator all the time, most probably having a higher combined income in the future and of course: flip-flop sex. Also dicks are just awesome :3 "
"1. Your BF sounds very nice, keep him 

2. You and your BF have done everything right. Just go on to the next guy."
OMG your lil bro TOTALLY READ you for FILTH! SLAAAAAAAAAAY!!!
"Don't lie to him and say it just 'died of natural causes'. If he's had the thing as long as that he will know you aren't being honest and that will make things *much* worse.

You could probably skip the part about being drunk and say you tripped on a cable or something, but aside from that I would say honesty is the only way out of this."
"&gt;A week later, it's dead. 100%. It's shed all of it's blossom, all of it's leaves, the ends of the branches are curling up and it's roots are all turning black. I don't know what to do. 

Take it to a professional botinist. It might not actually be dead, just dying. "
"I think it is a bigger deal to people who have overcome a lot. For example, it's a big part of my identity because of the struggle I had growing up, not being accepted by some friends, family reaction, etc. I am very proud of who I am and it took a lot for me to get where I am. Like others have said, it is a part of me, not all of me. But when I look back at who I was five years ago, I see how much I have grown up and a main part of that is because of the struggles. "
"21 years ago... The story has a happy ending though. My Mom put me in therapy (thinking it would make me straight) and the first session was a group session, just me and Mom, and I told the therapist the story. Soon after, he asked me to leave the room so he could have a one on one with Mom. I found out YEARS later that he basically destroyed her; educated her on HIV/AIDS/transmission, and that her son was NOT suffering from an illness/teenage angst.

We were Catholic, and seeing that she wasn't going to get the answers she wanted from the shrink, she went to our priest for advice. He told her to cut me off and consider me dead. And you know what? She actually did the *REAL* Christian thing... She gave him the finger, and said ""you don't know what Christianity means or its values""."
I can't get a guy pregnant.

"I'd wear a tiara and high heels. Dunno about anyone else.

But in all seriousness, I would decline the invitation if someone asked that of me."
Nope. The second they add a gay role in a main position it suddenly becomes a gay movie.
"Don't tell them at all. You never know someones true feelings on gay people until you come out to them.

You're brother is likely waiting until he's not financially dependent on your parents anymore which is usually always the recommended route. 

"
"I do this too, but they always seem to go limp when I start crying and hugging their dick goodbye. "
"Not being bound to that narrative of having a wife, a kid, and a house with a white fence. Also, the freedom of being able to do *anything* in bed, not just following the role society put on my gender. Not seeing women as sex objects.



Most importantly though, I get to eat man ass. That's the best kind of ass. I honestly feel like the entire evolution of humanity has led to me eating ass. But that's probably how straight men feel as well when eating pussy. Ugh."
Honestly if they're looking for a nanny/prostitute they're probably weirdos. That's my two cents.
My favorite part of liking men is reading posts like this.
"My parents (I was 16, and had 6 year old siblings) made me move my razors/toothbrush to the unshared upstairs bathroom so my siblings wouldn't get AIDS."
"Funny how the Republicans always seem to cut taxes on rich people and run up huge deficits, then cry poverty when it's time to do anything for poor people. 

I'm enthusiastically voting for Hillary. "
"Being able to roll with gay jokes and not have my manliness threatened. It's even better with straight guys because most will use gay stuff as insults where as I take it as ""invitations"". So when the guys are talking shit and shout out ""you suck dick!"" It's fun to be like ""quite well I'm told. I'm proud"" and then we can all have a good laugh about it. But if they call each other out like that then they start getting serious. The hetero ego is a very fragile thing. Being openly bi has made that part of my life easier. I don't have to worry about protecting my manly image üòÇ"
Guy cousin: you gonna try to hit on me?
"A few years after I came out (last Christmas) when it was just my dad and I at my parents house, he sat me down and told me to be celibate until I was in a committed relationship. Because I'd get HIV, which means AIDS.

I had just turned 22. I'm an infectious disease researcher, he's an industrial engineer.

I told him to read more than the abstract of the CDC reports.
"
"Honestly? Cuddling with a guy. Idk, I've done it with girls, but cuddling with a guy is something else. Even if they're more timid or soft-spoken, there's a certain power that you can sense just under a guy's exterior that makes cuddling with them such a unique experience lol"
While sexy webcamming with a guy once he told me my underwear would look good wet - I said OK and went to the bathroom and put my underwear under the shower. It was only when I got back I realised he wanted me to piss myself *duuhhh*
"Muslim friends have parties over at their place all the time with their parents there and they tell me not to say anything gay. 

I decline every time. Not  going back in the closet. "
I had to come out to my cousin in order to explain why I was giggling like nuts all of a sudden on this sub. thank you /u/kookookachu26 for giving me the balls to do it tonight.  
"TIL being a Muslim is ""illegal"" in the US."
If it's anything like racial minorities I'd say we got awhile.
I would be offended and would not attend. You're  inviting your friends to celebrate your and your spouse's love while telling them to hide theirs at the same time. It is a slap in the face for equality. 
Just be you.
Like maybe half the hookups I did in my late-teens/early twenties.
Leave his keys under the carpet and run away. Get out of the country if possible. Block him on every possible way.
"Because he's the only candidate that hates minorities as much as them, tbh."
If we're having sex and you're still able to form sentences or even phrases then I must not be doing a very good job.
"It's hard for me to cum from a blowjob. I don't think I ever have, actually. Love giving one though. "
Because that implies he's already bored with you and might as well use his time to find a new one. Dump his ass.

"He can discuss a topic that doesn't involve himself. For more than 5 minutes. And does so intelligently. And it's actually interesting. And he appreciates your responses to what he says.

"Actually, I had a boyfriend for a year and a half with my exact same name except the middle name, and that included the Jr.

Since he ended up stalking me, this provided some confusion to the court and sheriff.
"
"Lol I got blown by this guy I met on grindr once. The guy happened to have a gay twin brother who is also on grindr and wanted to blow me. I was gonna go to his place a second time and then he was all like ""lol well apparently you met my brother already"" I was like what the actual fuck üòÇ. This whole time I was thinking it was the same person"
"In contrast to [what I love](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/4w3ytt/what_do_you_love_most_about_being_a_gay_man/d63sc5i), which is many things, there's three things I don't like:

1. Not always feeling comfortable or safe to be affectionate in public ‚Äî there's some areas where my BF will hold my hand and I almost feel like telling him not to because I don't feel safe doing it here. That sucks for sure. (I guess this gripe just boils down to homophobia)
1. STD's like HIV being a bigger concern than for straight dudes.
1. Having sex where poop comes from. I love anal sex, don't get me wrong, but it would be nice to not have to deal with any prep work or occasional poop mishap! I kinda envy straight couples for that.

But I think the pros of being gay majorly outweigh the cons."
Lettuce fuck
"This guy I was chatting with on Grindr was all fine and dandy until his Donald Trump support came out. I'll be friends with a Trump-Pence supporter without any problem. Respecting different views isn't hard for me. But dating someone who supports a candidate who's running mate is anti-LGBT and belongs to a party that vehemently cannot stand people like myself is a no-go.

This morning, I declined to give him my number. So I was called ""pathetic.""

I'll be voting for Hillary Clinton, and I'm not affiliated with any particular party."

"I don't think that it's been regressing so much as becoming exposed to a much wider audience. 

One of the interesting things that we (hopefully) learned from Brexit is that the two major political sides weren't directly addressing one another at all. 

In the US, I see a lot of the same thing happening. The communications and media system changes over the past few decades have enabled a highly personalized newsmedia interaction experience.  We now have echo chambers.  On the one hand, there's Fox News and StormFront, on the other is Tumblr and Comedy Central.   

One thing that (briefly) living in the Southern US taught me was that large groups with fairly (IMO) undesirable trends - racism, sexism, etc still maintain a large, active population. And they're reproducing. Most importantly, they are producing a narrative that doesn't even seem to co-exist in the same reality that the Left inhabits.  Trump's nomination acceptance speech was a wake up call for me: it made me aware of how incredibly dangerous the faith-based political machine can be. People are manufacturing their own facts.  

I like to think that Reddit can do some good, by exposing the more centrist members of these communities to things outside of their normal media consumption habits, it might help restore some use of Earth-logic to someone and fulfill the promise of the internet. "
"According to all reputable economists, Trump's tax plan is voodoo. It would create an unprecedented deficit. Tax Foundation has an obvious ideological bias. Hillary's plan is the one where the numbers actually work out when you re-crunch them. 

Even if Hillary is in the pockets of US oligarchs (which is probably bullshit), Trump is much more closely linked to Russian oligarchs. Trump's only influence on the GOP platform was to change the stance on Russia to a friendlier one. Trump has threatened to dishonor NATO. It is likely that if Trump is elected, on Inauguration Day, Russia executes its Baltic invasion plans and conquer Latvia, Lithuania, and maybe Estonia (although it doesn't need Estonia to connect Kaliningrad to the rest of the country) while Trump does nothing. A vote for Trump is a vote for Putin. If you vote Trump, you love Russia more than you love America. 

Also, Weibo (Chinese Twitter) users support Trump because they think he's the real life version of Cartman who will fuck up America and allow China to pull ahead. "
"Well, if anything, he was progressive enough to believe gay men could go without sex before commitment."
It's a little harder to approach someone you're interested in in public because you don't know if they're gay.
"If you have to secretly track your boyfriend using GPS and he has to come up with elaborate stories which seem like obvious lies, you should move on. "
"Am I the only one who saw abs capitalized like that and immediately thought of antilock brakes?

Oh, I am... Uh ok. Carry on then"
"I love that my BF is a dude and so we don't have to deal with girly stuff all the time at home like (sexist stereotypes incoming) make-up, periods, mood swings, pink and flowery stuff, gossip and bithcing, hair clips all over the house, irrational actions and arguments that I can't understand, wanting the toilet lid down, etc! Haha!

I love that as boys we're both horny all the time and it's so easy to get each other off ‚Äî dicks are simple ‚Äî if we both feel like cumming fast we can just do that. I like flip-flop sex, a boys flat body vs a womans curves, the way dicks flop about, how fun balls are to play with, and that it's easy to see when we're horny.

On a smaller note, I also like that we can buy clothes and share them. That makes life easier.

In conclusion; think girls are just too complex for me, in both mind and body. Boys are straightforward and simple, which makes life more fun and stress free! Everything is what it is. That's what's great about being a gay man."
Same tbh. I don't even tell people I am unless they ask.
Bitch read him up and down
"There is no good answer to this really.

It depends on the man's face, his hairline, the texture of his hair, his age..and other variables.

It might be best for the guy to select a few styles that he likes, get photos of those styles and then bring the photos to a really good stylist..... And ask the stylist for advice on which of those styles would actually look the best on him."
"I'm on the small side of average and had a healthy single sex life: plenty of hook-ups, FWBs, fuck buddies, etc, and even landed a husband who loves me just the way I am. Confidence goes a long way I suppose."

"Racial minority here. Who's also gay.

"One time I got really drunk and stuffed my penis into a bowel of room-temperature mac and cheese. 

Chill, brah. "
"Why does it need to be an 'announcement?'

Why not just live life honestly - be yourself, date who you want, talk about your life normally. If being gay happens to be relevant, talk about it then. ie:

* SomePerson: What did you do last weekend?
* You: Oh, me and my boyfriend went to the movies.
* SomePerson: Do you have a girlfriend?
* You: Nawh, don't have a boyfriend - not dating anyone right now


""Being Out"" doesn't mean you need to make a grand announcement - everywhere you go, just simply living your life honestly, and talking about it honestly without doing pronoun changes all over the place."
"If someone asked my husband and I to do that,  I'd decline and wouldn't be attending "
Challenge accepted 
"Being Indian I understand your position and I would attend and wouldn't be offended. Some of the replies here seem to suggest a lot of people might take a lot of offense to it though. I think you could obviously frame the request in a more tactful way that doesn't explicitly tell people to act straight - maybe just mention that your fiances family is very conservative so you'd request people to be mindful of that at the wedding

Justin Bieber is gross.
"My husband has multiple orgasms when he bottoms or uses a toy, he doesn't ejaculate though. He says they feel a bit different than his normal orgasms, a whole body sensation and not as focused as a regular orgasm with ejaculation. They tend to build in intensity the more he has, and he can keep going as long as I can keep going. He ends up a quivering mess. 

Supposedly you can train yourself to have prostate orgasms like this, but they're just my husband's natural reaction."
You had me at foreskin. You lost me at unwashed dick.
"If she was disgusted, that's what she deserves for snooping."
"Wear something subtly rainbow.  Like a bracelet or a ring.  If guys think you're hot, they'll check you out, see the rainbow, and make advances.

Also, what's with the vitriol in the replies?  This can't be an uncommon problem for a gaybro.  I'd wager most of the time a gaybro would fly under the radar, likely without any intention to do so."
"I've always said the best thing about being gay is that you no longer have to apologize for any of your preferences, as you already have the most ""taboo"" preference there is. 

I can like the girly music that I like, dance the way I like and do the things and have the interests I like without worrying if they are not 'manly' enough."

"You're FUCKING 20 YEARS OLD!! Grow up.

You don't need daddy to take you to the fucking doctor. Be a big boy and go yourself.


It is not your father's fault if you get a fucking STD, first of all.


When you fuck random guys in school you have to take fucking responsibllity. You learn the risks, and wear protection and make smart choices, and you accept the consequences. That's what sex is. You don't get to blame this on your dad.


Second. It's probably not even hpv. You could be just paranoid. Not every issue around your genitals is and std or sti, so you need to go to a clinic, alone, and find out. 

If insurance is the issue, there are tons of free and cheap std clinics in most areas."
Sounds like you handled that in the right way. You were open and talked to your other half. It sounded to me that the third guy knew he had to have you there to do anything with your other half and was stringing you along.
I hate seeing straight people so relaxed and comfortable about PDA and the jealousy I feel because of it. 
"It's not about discrimination, it's about them taking every possible precaution to prevent spreading blood borne illness. Holy fuck not everything is about ""social justice"", keep it out of medicine."
Let him go at his own pace. And what does a 15 year old write like? I know 50 year old people who write like they never passed 2nd grade English.
"Do the exact same things he's doing. Rub your ass against his, talk about jerking off, and let him catch you staring at his dick. ;)

Disclaimer: this may not be sound advice so you should probably just listen to other people or just talk to him."
Size queens... ugh. 
"Awesome, that is even better than the time I was supposed to tie this dude up and do nasty stuff to his balls but instead I just started buying weed from him."
Might as well share them with us since you already let your ma have a gander.
I didn't know another out gay person until I was 18. I treat my straight friends now like I treated my straight friends then.

"I view it basically the same as [this.](http://extrafabulouscomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Untitled-11.gif). I'm not generally a fan of long hair, so I'm not that big a fan of man buns as an extension of that. But I think I don't really look at anybody who has a man bun any differently than someone who has, say, a fade. It's just a common modern hairstyle that works for a relatively large proportion of men, nothing interesting."
"Tell the family that their Middle Eastern values are going to have to be put on hold for the night. You have friends that are gay and the family will not be allowed to make them feel unwelcome. 

Basically, instead of you being shitty friends and trying to shove your friends back into the closet, tell the family not to be shitty human beings. As long as the family is forewarned, they should be able to resist the urge to act like barbaric children. "
"Unbiased input says *hell yes* it's inappropriate to ask people to ""act straight"". 

But it's also inappropriate to be homophobic.

Even on this day your fiance's family can't scale back their homophobia, eh? I'd just be casual, and honest with them ""there's going to be gay people there. Is that going to be a problem for you?"". And I wouldn't invite the homophobes. "

Neither person has to deal with periods. 
Humor comes from an unexpected or incongruous response to situations. People who live outside the norm tend to see the unexpected in life more than those who were raised in a stable environment where everything went as it was intended to. Similar for people who are persecuted. Gay men have both. 
I'm so sick of dudes assuming I'll top them just because I'm a cucumber. 
"&gt;
Having sex where poop comes from. I love anal sex, don't get me wrong, but it would be nice to not have to deal with any prep work or occasional poop mishap! I kinda envy straight couples for that.

To be fair women have to deal with UTIs, yeast infections, periods, and pregnancies or hormone altering birth-control. Straight dudes come out ahead, but straight ladies put in maintenance. "
"The first time someone ""tries"" you, let them know you're not going to put up with their bs. If it continues...Ignore them, and don't lay a finger on anyone unless they hit you first.

If someone does say something that hurts you--don't let them see it. Don't give them a reaction unless it's absolutely necessary. 

Own your truth, and don't let anyone make you feel ashamed of being who you are. Confidence goes a long way. It got me through high school with minimal bullshit."
Do you mean 'didn't?' You're not even in the right tense.
"There are vast numbers of us that find the ""skinny"" guys very attractive and I suspect that a lot of the criticism is from people who are jealous; there's no denying that skinny people tend to be healthier and live longer.

"Mine is: I'm Gay, not blind."
"I'm 4"" hard and top. I've never had a problem using it. However I've been told by rude exes that it ""let me down when I first saw it"" or had guys laugh at me and try to humiliate me and try to tell me what a ""real dick"" is. I don't like hearing any jokes or comments about size at all...good or bad. It really hurts to be made fun of, but there's nothing I can do about it. 

If a guy is that shallow about it, he's not worth my time honestly. I'm looking for a relationship, not just a piece of meat. I'm upfront about it to weed out the shallow douchebags who ""need"" bigger cocks. "
"I thought it was a rodeo thing. Riding ""bareback"" in rodeo is riding a stallion without a saddle (i.e. the condom). Which is a lot more.....intimate but also risky. "

don't jack off eight times a day.

"Describe what is ""very effeminate"".

You don't have to like the person running the country, but you have to have faith in their ability to do so. Nothing about Trump suggests he deserves that faith on financial matters. He is a pariah in the business community, which sees him as a risky, reckless, conman with a trail of lawsuits, unpaid contractors, stiffed shareholders, and bankruptcies in his wake. He is bad business.

Moody analyzed that Trump's economic 'plan' will lose the US 5 million jobs over the course of a presidential term, relative to the status quo. Clinton's economic infrastructure and and jobs plan will add approximately 10 million jobs in the same time period, again according to Moody. Trump is bad business and bad tax policy rolled into one. Everyone likes lower taxes, but you get what you pay for. If we the people don't invest in our country, no one else will. If you lower taxes but don't want to cut down on the quality of life, you run up deficits and end up paying for it later. Clinton is the only fiscally respectable candidate running.

I'm not even going to bother addressing Trump, and especially Pence, on social issues. You've obviously recognized both their records are embarrassing on that front also.

There is only one rational choice, be it on social or fiscal issues, this November: Hillary Clinton.
"
"&gt; but then I think to myself is moving to California or some place and just getting used by guys who don‚Äôt care about me and just use me for sex a good life?

I moved to California at 18 and it was the best decision I ever made.  And although it happens, ""[j]ust getting used by [people] who don't care about [you]"" happens everywhere, even in small towns in Mississippi.  

But if you use your brain to look out for he warning signs that your Prince Charming"" might not actually be so princely, you'll be okay.  Most guys actually are looking for some kind of connection with other people and you can do just fine for yourself dating them.

That said, if you actually *do* want people to just ""use you"" sometimes, that's fine too.  Some people aren't looking for a romantic connection and just want to have sex.  There's nothing wrong with that if that's what you want.

&gt; Is that a better life than trying to have a wife and a family?

That's a choice for you to make, but you're making a false dichotomy there.  How about a husband and a family?

&gt; I know some gay guys meet the one and settle down and have a family but it‚Äôs a tiny minority most probably die alone and sad and I don‚Äôt want to die alone and sad.

Your numbers are out of whack.  Lots of us fall in love and settle down... we just tend not to settle down in rural Mississippi because we have reasonable fears for our safety and the safety of our property.

&gt; I don‚Äôt get how guys my age can just be gay?  How can this not mess with your head?

By not hating who you are inside.  If you are attracted to dudes, you're attracted to dudes.  You've been told it's wrong, but if you look inside yourself, you'll see it's not hurting you.  Fall in love with someone, and you'll see it might actually be the greatest, best, most fulfilling part of your life.

If you cannot love yourself for who you are right now, that's not unusual: you're a teenager figuring out your place in the world.  But those feelings are also not something you have to go through alone.  If you're having trouble seeing how you might ever be happy, please find someone to talk to, preferably a smart, gay-friendly psychotherapist.  Persistent, repeated, intrusive thoughts about your anticipated (seemingly inevitable) perpetual unhappiness are a key symptom of depression, which is a real and dangerous disease for which you can and should seek treatment."
"What I've seen is that if you have a gay character their sexuality should be relevant to the plot, otherwise it's pointless. But if you make it relevant to the plot it's just pandering to SJWs.

"When he says he wants to meet up again and then actually follows through. If I don't want to see a guy again, I don't lie. If I want to see you again, let's hang out within the next couple weeks. The dating scene is full of indecisive people. "
"Weird how everyone is like, ""It's not that big apart of my life"", despite it being a major thing.   Our sexuality is still a major button topic in politics in the US. When I look for jobs I look for places that are LGBT friendly, because I don't want to wrestle with HR to get my partner health insurance.  

So yes being gay is a big thing to me. "
"Men smell awesome. I'm sure 50% of that is consumer products, but even men who don't wear anything smell ""nicer"" than women. "
"I'm unenthusiastically voting for her because according to her official stances she's the next closest match to me after Jill stein, and I absolutely can't allow Mike pence in the White House. "
"Me and my boyfriend recently went to a Japanese exhibition in London that had a Sake tasting experience. After lots of sake and giggles, we got to the last taster which was jelly sake... It had the consistency of thick cum and I just shot my boyfriend a look and he knew immediately what I was thinking and blushed so much.. followed by a lot more giggling"
"That ""friend"" was trying to steal your boyfriend, but your boyfriend didn't fall for that shit. He is great. Also, I bet he was trying to manipulate you into making a scene so your BF would think you are crazy. Like he even said he wanted to go back and try to drive you crazy again lmao "
Quivering mess sounds so hot
link son...
Being embarassed dancing with a guy in public
Jill Stein panders to homeopaths. 
"Man, the amount of desperate lonely people on this subreddit is astounding.

He fucked someone else then dumped you. You don't wait to initiate contact again, dumbass. "
"I think so. I joined reddit after doing some reading of posts from years ago. I was super impressed, and had to join. But those qualities of posts aren't there as much. I feel like I missed Reddit when it was at its best. 

I think you make a good point. This presidential campaign is a big deal, and Trump is shaping a lot of opinions. Sad."
"&gt; I mean the drug part is kinda true

I've never taken any drugs. I barely drink (5-6 beers a year, maybe.) so I'm pretty sure that being gay has nothing to do with drugs. x3 "
"One of my best friends is effeminate and I love him to pieces. I just can't be around anyone with an over the top personality, no matter the sexual orientation or gender identity. "
"Good for you!  As you recognized, nobody is really going to notice what you're up to unless you're seriously being rude (or they want to fuck you).

Also, fair warning: You are going to be sore as HELL tomorrow, and possibly even sorer the next day.  That is weakness leaving the body.  It will stop happening pretty soon if you keep it up."

Ive been reading http://www.nifty.org/nifty/gay/ since i was 12 and it still gets me way harder than porn ever can. 
"""baby, I love you, but I need to talk to you because I'm scared. I saw a Grindr notification on your phone, and I'm asking you about it because I don't want to let my mind run away with it for no reason. I'm not making any ultimatums to you, I'm not saying *anything*, except that I want you to tell me whatever's on your mind, even if it's scary, because we can deal with anything if we're forthright with one another. Will you talk to me as you partner, even if it's scary?""

Then shut up and let him talk. 

Don't ask loaded questions. Don't make it a power play. Don't make any demands. Just ask open ended questions. You can make this a turning point in your relationship - it can either be the beginning of something transcendently amazing or the beginning of the end. Put down your ego and insecurities. And just talk to this man you love. 

Once that's been accomplished, you can decide what you need to do and what you can do. Understand that you can't fundamentally change someone and you can't jam anyone into your vision of a perfect partner. All of us have a price of entry. Find out his price and decide if his virtues are worth it for you. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"My friends call me the straight guy whisperer because I've been approached by many curious and closeted guys. Most of the time it's just a guy who knows me through the grapevine or hanging with people and he finds out I'm gay. Just approach them say hi ask leading questions about who they are, get them interested in you, show interest in them beyond 'the gay thing', I'm sure the gay topic will come up in conversation fairly easily and quickly, usually does, then casually pull him aside and ask if he's single, if he is approach you're curious and see if he knows anyone that you can experiment with. Don't assume he will be willing, gage his reactions and see if you've peaked his interest. If you have things will flow from there. It's no different than picking up a woman and set your boundaries, what are YOU interested in and comfortable with. I never go beyond what they're not willing if they say stop its over no matter how hot things are getting. Don't worry about the whole am I top or bottom thing either just enjoy it for what it is. Happy humping! "

"By the time the clothes are off, I couldn't care less about a guy's dick size. Penises of all sizes are fun. Heck, I'd even go as far as to say smaller dicks are more fun to suck and make anal a lot easier.

The P-spot is about 3 inches up the butt anyway. I've had a lot more fun with smaller penises battering my prostate than I've had with 8 inch dicks tearing my ass apart. To each their own, I guess."
Go for an meet and greet. See what your gut tells you.
"Such a cute story! Honestly, it already sounds like a beautiful love story. Imho, you have two options: Either tell him your feelings or take it a bit slower (in particular in case you think he might not be ready to accept being gay or in a relationship).In the later case hug him longer, more intense, give him kisses on the cheek, mouth etc. You'll see how he reacts to this. Sometimes things develop and don't need to be discussed upfront. Good luck! Suerte!"
"It's definitely not regional, but it's also not exclusive to the gay community. Maybe your friend lacks sexcabulary or something? I've heard that term thrown around by gay and straight people so I wouldn't think about it too much. Just don't start unleashing ""breed"" or ""fletching"" or something like that...might be a bit more awkward to explain. 
*Edit - Yes I meant felching. I am a bad gay. Also I shouldn't really be googling all these terms at work because, ya know...*"
"I would never even consider a guy who didn't have ABS, the technology is cheap and fitted as standard these days so why take the risk. It only takes some loose gravel l before you're in a ditch."
"A few things regarding your arguments on the benefits of a Trump presidency:

First, your source on the merits of his tax plan, The Tax Foundation, is the Academic equivalent of a million Hindenburg Airships. It is widely [regarded](http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/08/the-greek-menac.html) as nothing more than a tax-*hating*, overly pro-business mouthpiece for conservative lunatics. According to other, far more reliable studies (See [here,](https://piie.com/commentary/op-eds/trumps-trade-policy-big-loser) [here,](https://www.economy.com/mark-zandi/documents/2016-06-17-Trumps-Economic-Policies.pdf) and [here](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-tax-plan).), Trump's tax plan would **shrink** the labor force by **11** **million** **workers,** reduce household incomes for middle-class Americans, cause the national debt to skyrocket due to $11 trillion in lost revenue, reduce the US' GDP by roughly 1.6 trillion dollars, and according to the second link, cause a recession larger than the one in 2008 a mere two years after being implemented. 

Second, while the Affordable Care Act, in my opinion (and yours it would seem too, OP), is a poor piece of legislation, Trump's plan would be even worse. According to a recent analysis (Found [here,](http://crfb.org/blogs/analysis-donald-trumps-health-care-plan).), Trump's health care plan would increase the cost of coverage across the board, eliminate coverage altogether for 22 million Americans, and cost hundreds of billions of dollars to implement.

Third, on your Common Core point, I'm not sure what effect the standards have had on your niece and nephew, but the vast majority of studies conducted (Examples [here,](https://edexcellence.net/publications/evaluating-the-content-and-quality-of-next-generation-assessments) and [here](http://hechingerreport.org/the-surprising-initial-results-from-a-new-common-core-exam/).) have found the standards to improve academic performance and better foster college and career readiness amongst students. Plus another [study](http://www.edweek.org/media/ccsso_spaces-blog.pdf) found that most teachers support the standards. Regardless, even if that weren't the case and the standards *weren't* working, they were passed by STATE governments, Trump could ATTEMPT to cut off funding for the common core, but he couldn't eliminate them even if he tried; that's up to the states.

I'm a Republican-leaning independent who supported McCain in '08 and Romney in '12 because I concluded that the Republican Party would move leftward on LGBT+ issues in the future and I could support their other policies in the meantime. There are reasons to support *other* Republicans. As for Trump, he's a racist, xenophobic, sexist, maniac who would be remembered as one of the most disastrous mistakes ever elected to the Presidency.

I'm no fan of Hillary, but I certainly support her over Trump."
"""I don't have sex so nobody does"" "
Having more freedom to explore gender roles and expression
Can't tell if sarcastic or worthy of /r/ShitAmericansSay
Don't you?
"Being free from the expectations of a typical heterosexual relationship. Since I'm already breaking the norm by being gay, I may as well ignore most of the other norms too and just focus on what I want in a relationship, not what society says I should have.

Also, sucking dick is the best thing ever."
"[Me](https://www.instagram.com/p/BElncJYihO_/?taken-by=myseoulcalledlife), hi. "
I'm sure you could find someone to toss your salad.
Earlobe nibbles are the best. So is tracing the ear. But I dont give guys wet willies with my tongue. At least not in the ear.

the librarians check the study rooms for this sort of thing. they'd like to not discover you and your guy getting it on. don't be that guy... 
Why should I marry you when I can just eat you?
"All the salty replies to this make me sad. Not everything is deadly serious guys, we can have fun sometimes."
Lack of civil communication. You can solve so many problems if you take the time to calmly talk them through but if you cant do that youre doomed. 
"If you know for a fact that your parents will be supportive about you being gay, then I'd say yeah, go for it.

If there is *any* chance that they won't be OK with it, I wouldn't do that. It could make a stressful situation even worse, and an uncomfortable situation for your boyfriend.

I'd say sit them down alone for the conversation. IF that goes well, then tell them about your boyfriend, and introductions can be had."
"Kissing is still cheating in my book

The way this is written is like you're making your bf out to be a bad guy. 

If you don't like him just leave him instead of kissing other guys behind his back "
You should change your username then.
Just have a look in my Grindr messages.
"Reminds me of an old joke:

My sister said, ""Take my shirt off"". 

So I took her shirt off. 

My sister said, ""Take my skirt off"".

So I took her skirt off. 

My sister said, ""Take my bra off"". 

So I took her bra of. 

My sister said, ""Don't you dare wear my clothes again"". 

So I didn't. "
"Wash it perfectly, make it perfect for being used again, then put some chili sauce inside. 

And wait. "
"This happened on Deep Space Nine once. So long as he's not possessed by an evil entity when he gets back, things could be worse.

Assuming that doesn't happen, you're just gonna dig a bigger hole if you lie about it.  "
"YEARS ago, I had a regular FWB for a while with this guy.  Well, I was fucking him doggy style, on the side edge of the bed, and I didn't know (at the time) that his bed rolled.  Well, I was getting kinda rough, and really into it, and I leaned forward over him and put my hand against the wall, needless to say, the bed rolled away from the wall, he/we fell forward, smashed his head and left a really good dent in the wall.  

We fell to the floor, the bed went sailing across the hardwood floors.  We laid there on the floor for a few seconds before we both started laughing hysterically.  It took us a good few minutes to compose ourselves, and it was just so funny, there was no way we were going to recover the moment.  "
That guy DEFINITELY DL sucks BBC on Craigslist. Just ignore him he'll get caught by his wife eventually.
"He lied to you, cheated on you, exposed you to HIV, emotionally abused you and you still take him back?

Jesus Christ man, you're so blinded by love you're willingly putting yourself physically and emotionally at risk. He's a toxic man, just stay away from him."
"My mom believing that PrEP is an enabler of a sinful, filthy (i.e. gay) lifestyle, because it prevents HIV. 

Yeah, there's a lot of baggage going on right now."
You must not watch Drag Race. 
The other funny part is that a lot of other people won't hesitate to tell you about their taboo preferences as soon as they find out you're gay since everyone assumes gay guys are a judgment free zone on kinkiness.
Thrill of the risk. 
I'd rather meet someone in real life instead of hooking up with a guy who looks like Tarzan in his photo and talks like Jane when I meet him up. 
Go to church and delete those apps you filthy sinner.
You can summon us with a pentagram made from glitter.
