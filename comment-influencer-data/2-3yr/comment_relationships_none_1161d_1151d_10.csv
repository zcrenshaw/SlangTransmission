"OP, do this.

If he's doing this to you, he's most likely done it before and will likely do it again.  If HR has had complaints about him before, they'll need this to build the case, and if they haven't, then having your info on record will help prevent him from doing it again."
"In your mind, maybe, but not in hers. You should probably at least try to see where she's coming from if you want to resolve this.

Honestly, I think it's not so much that you're naked, it's the fact that you didn't tell her about it might be the worst part for her. Imagine how confused she must have been the first time people were like, ""Hey, your husband's got a nice dick!"" and she had NO IDEA what they were talking about. Whereas if you had told her ahead of time, she could have been better prepared.

I mean, if someone came up to her and said, ""Hey, your husband does some cool unboxing videos,"" it wouldn't have the same punch, even if she didn't know about the videos. Does that make sense?"
Whether or not anonymous email sender gets his/her way is irrelevant to me what I do care about is how this discovery affects my relationship.
"How to bring it up, just cut to the chase. ""Annie, someone sent me a link to a porn website containing the videos you acted in. I feel betrayed that you never told me about that and that I had to find out this way.""

&gt; is this worth ending the relationship over?

Some will say yes, some will say no. To figure out what you think, postpone the wedding and do couples counseling. (And/or individual counseling.) It's entirely possible that you and your relationship will power through this and it won't really pose any big issues. It's also entirely possible that this will sink the relationship for good. "
"He still has the right not to be comfortable with it 

It's like if I start doing test for pharmaceutical companies. I might have nobles intentions, but my partner could not be comfortable with me doing that"
I agree. That is strange to be away that long and not talk each night just to catch up for ten mins and say I Love You All before bedtime?  That's what families do.

"It sucks and it's unfair but the child should not suffer because that would be much more unfair. The father decided to have unprotected sex. The child had no say. A child is entitled to financial support from _both_ parents, period. "
"Why do you talk to her? She sounds like a right cow.

I bet you'd be happier if you went low/no contact with her"
"yes get tested.

also GOOD RIDDANCE TO THE RATS.

BE BEST FRIENDS WITH JADE.

and a big fuck u to your stupid friends who didnt tell you. "
"It's not all that weird. Your roommate's personality is practically palpable in your post. If he reduces relationships down to the match percentage of a site, that should tell you plenty about him. Simple, petty, stuck-up, selfish jerk feels like an apt description."
"Hi, go to your best friend's parents and tell them what you told us. If they are normal responsible people they will help you. We would do anything for our daughter's best friends if they needed us."
"No, you're right, I absolutely would not be okay with it."
"For what it's worth, it may be worth calling corporate/HR/someone. I worked for a national company and was terminated for the exact same reason. One call to corporate HR where they investigated (found out I wasn't scheduled, I gave notice, it was approved) and I got my job back. 

I wouldn't roll over and take it. "
"I can't really comment on a specific time frame, but I'd say if this is how you're feeling right now, I wouldn't actively seek someone new yet if I were you.

This stuff takes time, do your own thing and shift your focus to other areas of your life for a bit, and it will probably happen organically, when you're totally ready.

Hope you're doing alright though man, that sounds really tough. Hang in there

EDIT: spelling"
"Exactly. Eight months is nowhere near enough time to have gotten used to the new normal, let alone to have accepted things enough to forgive the person who made it happen. 

Story time: I ended up permanently disabled in my 20's after back surgery. The surgeon messed up and caused a condition that made my body's pain signals go nuts on one side of my body. 

I will never have another day without this. I am in constant pain and I can only walk with forearm crutches. That surgeon's actions affected every facet of my life. The dreams I dread most are the ones I have of the way I was before, because it's so hard when I wake up. This is a life sentence, just like the damage you caused is for your brother. 

I forgave my surgeon after several years. But it took a while to get there, and I didn't have to see him or get a lot of pressure to do so. Plus, I knew my surgeon was at least trying to help me.

You're both teenagers. But he's still the victim. You are not now and never will be owed forgiveness. It is entirely up to your brother if he ever speaks to you again. If he doesn't, that doesn't make him wrong or bitter, it means that was how he came to terms with the impact of your actions on his life. I do think over time he may be willing to talk to you again, especially if you show as well as tell him that you're genuinely sorry. But you are not owed that, and it may never happen. You need to come to terms with that idea while he comes to terms with his disability and disfigurement.

I agree with the poster who suggested writing him a letter to express your remorse (without begging him to forgive you or talk to you or mentioning how hard it's been for you or how his injury makes you feel). 

One other suggestion: if you're in the US, you might also point your parents in the direction of the Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation. All states have a version of it, and it helps disabled people pursue education or training so they can work. Your brother might well get financial assistance with college (including community colleges and trade schools) that way. Just google ""state vocational rehabilitation agency list"" and you'll find yours. A gesture like that might do some good towards healing your relationship in the long run. "
It doesn't matter because she wasn't asking for him to purchase it anyway
"What is making her say he did this? Like is it pure delusion, or does she have something to back it up(even something mild)?"
"&gt; For the past year, he's become more distant. Examples include not visiting when I had a major surgery, forgetting he booked a ticket to see me when he had a break and went to another city instead, not coming to any major events in my life, and forgetting my birthday. All things he said only happened because of being overwhelmed with school and we both agreed that school should always be prioritized.

These are HUGE incidents. It doesn't matter why he wants to keep you hidden (and that is what he's doing). It matters that he's treating you like shit.

Your story sounds awfully similar to mine. My boyfriend left for grad school out of state. When I posted things on social media, I noticed that he did not accept the tags. When I called, he refused to pick up if he was with people. From my and our mutual friends' end, everything looked fine. But from his new grad school friends' end, there was no evidence I existed.

Which is how, for most his first year, he pretended he didn't have a girlfriend as he got closer and closer to other girls. Like your boyfriend, he called me paranoid before finally admitting it. I guarantee that it wasn't worth feeling so insecure for so long. I now have a great SO who loves being with me, and shows it - and that's what you deserve too."
"Have you asked your friends why they are treating your wife as if they're the high school cheerleading squad, and she's the nobody?

If they are treating someone you love that way, they aren't very good friends.

My heart goes out to your poor wife who moved for you, left her world behind, only to be picked on by the friends of the man who supposedly loves her while he uncomfortably stands by. And now she's pregnant, which is so physically exhausting, and they are going in for blood. She should go home, nurse herself through the pregnancy, and remind herself what it is like to be around people who care for her."
Tell him you'd like to see his drivers license. If he says no you have your answer.
"""Wonderful""

Shower sex is more struggle than it's usually worth :P"
Yes. They were actively undermining a marriage. A marriage in the middle of a pregnancy. That is a special kind of awful.

"He was happy to hide his misogynistic thinking and poor behavior when he didn't have a partner in crime. Now that he's found one, you're seeing the real him. 

Adam sounds like an absolute douchnozzle, but you can't blame him for this turn of events. Consider his entry into your guy's life a blessing in disguise. You get to run far, far away before you are legally committed to him. "
"Jesus, I knew I recognized this.

OP, what are you still doing with someone like this?"
"Assuming your mother's name isn't on your bank account, you already have control over your own finances.  Respectfully tell her that if she doesn't ever let you budget independently, then you'll never learn how to best manage your own finances, and you will not let her manage them at this time.

If she keeps pressing you to give her access to your account, I'd be concerned whether or not she wants access so she can withdraw money from your account.  Makes me think this is a distinct possibility if your family doesn't have much money like you say.  Is there anything that leads you to believe she doesn't handle her finances well on her own?"
"That was a really well, thought out response! You're right, we still love each other, but I am a little hurt he doesn't touch me like he used to or want me like he used to while I want him so much. "
If all three babies are born healthy and he sti has a problem with the fact that they're female therapy would be the best bet. Honestly therapy and counciling is the best bet regardless now that he's put this request out there. If it continues to be an issue and if he can't get past not having a son then they may want to look at seperating. Hopefully though that won't be the case.
"&gt; He's one of those people where as long as a professional says it he listens so I think that will work.

You should ask him why your word isn't good enough for him."
The only reason I'm apprehensive about trying for a baby in the future is that I only love steaks cooked medium rare.
"Exactly, his aversion to marriage shouldn't automatically trump OP's desire for marriage.

OP, you need to sit down and have a serious discussion with your boyfriend about this. If marriage is important to you, it's okay if his unwillingness to compromise is a deal breaker. It's better to end the relationship now than to prolong it and let the resentment build up over time. "
"Why *would* he mention he had a morning snack? This is a genuine question - why would you expect he would mention it? Clearly he's satisfied/happy with his mid-morning hot dog and doesn't need or want you to change anything about breakfast or lunches. So why mention something that isn't a problem, doesn't require any type of change or action, and doesn't actually matter in the course of the day?


Edited to add: it seems clear to me that it isn't the case that he felt he *couldn't* ask for more food, it's that he *didn't want* to ask for more food, as his daily hot dog was a perfectly good solution for me. "
"My ex-husband (kids' dad) is very active in their lives, my kids have a strong father figure and don't view my husband as their dad at all. That being said, if my husband starts to view my kids as his own that's great and all but I doubt he's gonna say ""I demand the right to help pay for 2 college bills!"" "
"&gt;Yesterday I told her not to talk to me until she came home with my bean boots

SHE GOT RID OF YOUR BEAN BOOTS?! That girl is not right in the head. Those things are a gift from the gods. Reliable, comfortable, and fashionable. I mean shit, go to *any* llbean store in the fall and ask for the classics and they will tell you they are backordered till July of next year. I'd wear mine all year round if the temperature allowed. 

I know she got them back but christ, that would have been the end for me if I was you. When your bean boots wear down you send them to freeport and they replace the soles for you and patch em up. Can't do that with a shitty girlfriend."
"If you go to the station request they are taken out of the equation for any potential bias. That is just an idea... I am not expert so if someone EXPERIENCE WITH THE LAW could chime in on this, that would be great. /r/legaladvice"

"No, I agree with you op. He should reclaim what is yours asap. "
"&gt; but it could also be because you are nervous and intimidated by their presence, maybe if you were comparing yourself to them or perceiving them as a threat

Yeah, I was thinking that might be possible so I kept asking my friend and he said ""Well you stare at them the same way most guys stare at girls. Idk.. You don't seem very intimidated. And remember when we met ""Kyle's"" brother at the skatepark? You looked like fell in love with him. I remember asking you something and you didn't even respond because you were just staring at him. Dude I feel kinda mean telling you these things but you're asking me. I'm not saying I know what's going on in your head or what you're thinking and if you tell me ""I'm straight"" I won't argue with that but you're asking me and my honest answer as a friend is it looks like you're attracted to guys and not attracted to girls. Dude I know that's not what you want to hear but at least now you know why people THINK you're gay."""
"&gt; This would be alright if the average woman kept a tight physical control on her purse at all times. This is not the case, and thus I and many other concealed carry advocates and enthusiasts, many of whom are much more knowledgeable and experienced then I am, strongly discourage purse carry and other forms of what is called ""off body carry"". 

Thank you for writing this, it's an extremely important point. 
"
"You need to tell him and you need to explain why you lied and that you won't again. 

This may be a dealbreaker for him, but he has to know."
"Yeah, there probably wasn't a couch around to sew himself into"
"I wish I could sit him down. He gets immediately defensive, shuts down and refuses to engage. It's frustrating. "
"You may not want to hear this but the best explanation I can find, using only the information in your post, is that she is unhappy with the relationship and is or has been thinking of breaking up with you. Opening the gift might make her feel sad about it and make her reconsider breaking up because she'll be worried about making you unhappy when she knows you love her."
"I mean, you *are* 25. I'm a little surprised that you're surprised at your dad's reaction. Sure, it doesn't sound like he expressed it in the most empathetic way, but yeah, this is something you should be able to take care of on your own."
"It's nice to see you want to be fair to him. It really is great that this is the only the first time he's purchased a home without your knowledge. 

Rather than drag this shit out, just separate now and save yourself the time, hassle, and years of resentment. Divorce this idiot, or you deserve whatever stupid shit he cooks up next."
"
&gt;About a year ago, my boyfriend and I discussed options and he pressured me into getting the implant despite all these side effects that I get. Basically he told me if we used condoms I would have to allow him to do anal with no condom, and I'm not comfortable with that. 

This is really fucking manipulative. He cares more about not wearing condoms than your health and well being.

"I think the husband wants to use ivf to make sure the baby will be a boy. 

If he was so concerned about her health, stress or cost of the babies, the time to have brought that up was when the doctor told them they'd be having triplets. Not 18 weeks later."

I know. Hulu gives you a free month when you cancel.
"If you got a bag packed you already plan on leaving. How about you go into the conversation without being completely confrontational? Cause you are giving all the signs you are going to be confrontational as hell here. I don't agree it's right to hide things, but you still don't know why she did. Make damn sure you know her reasoning before you take drastic steps. Whatever you hear may not be easy, but don't just get ready to write it off before hand. Take a step back for a minute. "
...and paying child support.
"Much tougher things? Tougher than having your wife carrying someone else's child? Tougher than having to deal with everything's bad about pregnancy for someone's else's, even your sister in law's, baby?"
Your husband is out having stimulating adult conversation all day every day. Don't lock yourself in the house all day just to keep him happy.
"&gt; think it's unfair that I end up comforting him

Yep, he's manipulating you.  The over top the top self blame song and dance is to guilt you into feeling bad.  He has no intent to change.  He's deflecting the conversation.  You end up comforting him and the discussion about your needs stop.  Stop playing his game here.

I don't like the jump on the counseling train, but you both may benefit from learning how to communicate with one another.  He is being very immature and manipulative here and you feel like you're talking to a brick wall.  It's no good and a third party may be able to give you some better tools."
"I was going to say exactly this.  And I'm a dude, but indeed as soon as I read ""but when she came to bed I didn't leave."" I thought yup, OP fucked up.  

Hell, even going to sleep in her bed to begin with is a boneheaded move (forgivable, but still dumb), but then sleeping in the same bed as her is really shady. "
"I saw your age and noticed you were 18. Does that mean you won't be in high school for much longer?

My fiancé has been told his entire life that he was gay. He was picked on a lot. He has a higher pitched voice and feminine mannerisms. Most of the people that have hit on him are guys and I have to beat both men and women off of him with a stick! Lol.

Anyway, what he did was own who he was. He had to work on having confidence in himself. 

People would ask, ""Are you gay?""
He would respond with, ""why?""

They would either stammer and say never mind or would actually explain why they thought those things about him. 

He would then either respond with, ""that was a pretty rude question."" Or ""so those things make you gay? Grow up and it isn't any of your business.""

In addition, do you really want to be friends with any of those bullies? As soon as they are mean to you, thank them in your head. They did all the hard work of telling you they are assholes without you having to befriend them first and find out first hand. "

"&gt; Anyway, according to them I've ""shown my true colors"" and am not a ""trustable"" friend. 

This is a load of bull. They're treating Jenny like she's something Jack owned that you stole. She's a person who made her own choice that she has the hots for you, it's not like she was an object that you stole from Jack's house."
"It's also how children of unhealthy parents learn to avoid conflict, which is what I'm reading from the MIL always trying to get him to give her things when she visits. "
"&gt;Another thing that concerned me was the fact that she was crying rather hysterically, it kind of makes me suspect that someone may have made her do something she wasn't comfortable with, especially considering that she is also a firm believer of saving herself for marriage.

Possibly, but more likely her realizing that she's pregnant and being scared that your parents would find out and lose their minds at the fact that she is sexually active and pregnant.

"
"I agree with everyone else, he raped you. And I know that's so disgusting and hard to hear and I'm so so sorry it happened to you at such a young age.

You could tell your friends you ended up having a miscarriage (but have an abortion) if you don't want to receive as much hate from them, but honestly they're not true friends if they're willing to be so awful to you after such an awful situation. If you ever need anyone to talk to PM me xx"
"I hate when parents use ""caring for and raising"" their child as something against the child later in life."
"My sister is beautiful; I am not.  I know what it feels like to get those desperate, shallow compliments from people who've just noticed aloud how gorgeous she is.  

It sucks, and it hurts.  But most people are not on the super beautiful part of the bell curve--they're the whole rest of the bell curve.  What helped me was to start really seeing all those people.  Your friends probably aren't all stunning, so what is it about them that draws you in?  Even with people you don't know.  Take notice when you see people in happy moments and take a second to know that people of all faces can have those moments.

You may not be beautiful, but non-beautiful people all over the world are finding ways to have satisfying, fulfilling, happy lives.  Once you start really seeing them, it becomes a lot easier to realize that you are going to be okay, too.

Hang in there."

"In groups we often find ourselves slotted into particularly roles. Some people become the leader, others the motherly one, others the raver and so on and so on.

It seems that this group have slotted you into the 'butt of the joke' role. It's not a nice place to be if you don't like it. 

It's disturbing to me that they continue to do this even though you've told them it upsets you. I know you say you don't want to drop them, but why would you continue to be friends with people who are hurting you even though you've told them you don't like it?"
"Thank you all so much for the comments. I'm absorbing them all and will respond to each one as I get through them.  The common theme is that I'm right to be upset, and the reactions range from ""leave her""  to ""you have a serious issue to resolve"".  I understand that nobody here knows us in person and context is hard to judge, so I will try to be measured and logical in how I handle this. 

In the meantime, I'll try not to talk to her by text today. I hate communicating by text message in the middle of a fight, it never helps and usually makes things worse. 

Thanks again to all of you for your feedback.

I read a lot of werewolf books.

"Me, pick me!  I have a kid.  I love her more than life itself.  I carried her under my heart for 9 months.  I went through 24 hours of unmedicated labor.  I breastfeed her.  She is currently nestled next to me in bed as I type this, sleeping peacefully. 

My wife did not go through pregnancy or birth or breastfeeding.  She is not biologically related to our baby at all - we used an anonymous sperm donor.  And yet, she loves our kid as much as I do.  I know this for sure.  (So does the kid - her whole face lights up when she looks at my wife)

If you can't love a child who is not related to you, don't get into a stepmother position.  "
It reminds of that lady in Joy Luck Club whos split everything with her husband 50/50 even the ice cream even though she didnt even fucking eat the ice cream. 
"To be honest I can also see the sunk cost fallacy becoming a large part of this.. a mentality, conscious or subconscious, along the lines of ""well also our relationship brought about the brothers' relationships so if we break up it was all in vain"""
"It's understandable for your parents to want their children to have some sort of relationship with each other. But obviously that should be 100% up to you. From their perspective, this is a ""childhood"" spat that can blow over at some point. If you're certain about how you feel, tell them that your relationship with your sister is over not only because of this one issue, but also that you don't like who she is, and that will not change, regardless of what happens with this guy. 

If they still ""don't understand"", they just don't want to understand. Tell them you've made your mind up, and that you're not going to discuss the issue any further. Then change the subject when they bring it up. "
"I have no doubt in my mind that your boyfriend's serenading of his co-worker and their behavior that night was the subject of much gossip among your friends and their co-workers.

I guarantee that all your friends (if they haven't told you in person yet) are rejoicing that you had the good sense to dump his ass after the way he humiliated you at your 4th of July party.

And as for your ex and the co-worker, the respect of their colleagues for them has most certainly gone down a few notches as well."
"*I told him I was sorry and it wasn’t an excuse to let things go*

OP, no. Why are you saying this to him? It's not true. Being pregnant is ABSOLUTELY a valid excuse to let housework go. I'm 11 weeks, and my contribution to cooking and cleaning has definitely slacked. If my husband said one word, I would be like, back up buster. And I had a pretty easy 1st trimester compared to you. Stress is TERRIBLE for the baby, and of all the things you can drop to ensure you're relaxed, housework is top of the list.

I think taking him to the doctor is a good idea, but I think YOU need an adjustment also in how you're thinking about this. Stop apologizing for growing your child! "
"We did no one under 18 and provided on-site sitters in a separate room for a range of kids from 6mo to 12 years. The 12 yo just bought his Nintendo DS and played that the whole time. It worked really well, happy kids, happy parents, no hurt feelings."
I have been suggesting therapy for years and he refuses to go. He says that the therapist would just tell him everything he knows already.
Very normal but you DO need a due date. I've been with my SO 4 years and would still want this in writing if I was borrowing off him.
"Also, you want a paper trail of her horribleness, so that, when this relationship falls through and she wants her son back, you have some standing to fight her."

"""You're a rape baby!"" ""Why are you friends with the rape baby?"" AH yes. Thankfully, this was middle school. Come high school, everyone was liberal and progressive. Suddenly, everyone wanted to talk to her, because, ""OMG. Your dads are heroes."" Kids are weird. "
"Pretty much. He ""doesn't do weddings"". He's never going to marry her, I hope she already realized this. "
"It's not just the age thing, you guys are at different stages in life and it seems like you want different things and have different opinions. He wants kids and marriage now, you want to understandably wait. You're uncomfortable around his friends, he doesn't like yours. He tells you that you act childish, which he's only saying because you're 22 years younger than him. "
"Honestly, I didn't get that impression at all, especially when the majority of his post is about her physical health:

&gt;  She seems so frail. She barely eats and she says she feels weak all the time. We work out together but she can barely work out anymore so she just does a bit of cardio then watches me.

He only mentions how he feels about her appearance *once* in the entire post."
"Bingo.

&gt;With no respect at all.

That's an extremely common phrase used by narcissistic parents. It's common for them to believe that their way is the only way, and any voice of disagreement is talking back and is disrespectful. There is no discussion. They are right.

While everything on the surface of OP's post seems sensible, she's ringing all of my alarm bells in those regards. She sounds exactly like my mother, who has an incredible talent at twisting situations and painting herself as the good guy being ganged up upon by the world.

Narcissistic parents also like to paint themselves the martyr by making unnecessary sacrifices ""in the name of the child"". Taking a work from home job so she can be closer to her 16 year old daughter? DING DING DING. That is not necessary in the least and is simply a voluntary sacrifice done for show.

&gt; Look at everything I have given up for you! Why are you not grateful? I deserve unquestioned obedience and submission.

Pretty much sums up the vibes I'm getting from OP."
"Yup, I think he tries way too hard. He seems obsessed with being scholarly and it's so annoying. I can't have a single shallow conversation with him, as stupid as that sounds. "

You sound like you have already justified your actions, but this hasn't painted you as a very good person. You did several wrong things here. "
"Sure, ideally. But you aren't because his parents aren't giving the stuff to him. So that isn't really much of an option right now."
"Sure, I can explain. I never implied it was going to turn into a ""fuck-fest"". I said it's not a matter of trust but respect. If my boyfriend is hanging out with another woman in a private setting, I feel sad/left out. If I do that to my boyfriend, he would feel sad/left out. I think that's human and I don't see a reason to pretend those feelings aren't there. Do either of us force the other person not to do it? Never. But we don't do it because even those slight twinges we're causing in each other aren't worth what we get out of spending time with someone else."

" &gt;I think you need to gain 20 lbs.

Jesus, yeah that was pretty blunt. She's right that she shouldn't have to change her body to fit your tastes but if this is a health issue then you should try to help her. How skinny is she? Is her hair falling out? Does she still get her period? 

Telling her to gain weight because you're not attracted to her will not get you anywhere. You need to approach this lovingly from a place of concern, ask her if she's been feeling ill. Ask her if she'd consider going to the doctor because rapid weight loss could be a sign of a serious illness. "
"But Jack IS being totally crazy. A 7 year obsession that he hasn't made a move on, or maybe he has asked her out and been rejected, and then he thinks she shouldn't be allowed to date? Thats pretty crazy. 

I have this theory that people who pine for years over someone but refuse to attempt a relationship actually Don't want a relationship. They want an excuse to  NOT be in a relationship because you have you be vulnerable and risk getting hurt. Its much easier to live in a 'what if' and 'someday' fantasy than deal with the real live person. But when the object of obsession dates someone else, the fantasy starts to crack apart. 

Jack needs therapy. He has real feelings but they are based on fantasy and he is reacting based on his fantasy of Jack and Jenny being 'meant to be together'. She can't be swept off her feet 'someday' if she is dating someone else.

"In your shoes, I would throw them away. She can't confront her mother about it anymore anyway, so all you'll be doing is giving her hurt where she has nowhere to go with it.

Burn 'em and don't tell her.

Also, if you can get her into counselling, that would be good. She needs to sort through some things with a professional."
"I haven't seen my thoughts up on here yet, so here goes: Your HUSBAD bought a house without your name on any of the paperwork! This IS HIS house YOU don'T OWN (or owe!! A thing on it!,When he goes to sell the home, the money will be all his, and convrsally, if you ended up in bankruptcy, it WILL be HIS credit taking the hit! Not you. You are in no way responsible for this home.
I live in the PNW, and a husband did this to my friend, she hated the home. They eventually went broke, and that's when she found SHE didn't own the house! It was all on him! 
So, you might have dodged a bullet, there, and if you help renovate this home with him, you are doing him a BIG favor! That's it!

Jesus christ you are a doormat! You need to have some self-respect and stop being so afraid of not being in a relationship. End things right this instant so you can have a shred of dignity left after all of this.
I think she's so convinced this is normal that she's not seeing how completely fucking asinine this whole situation is.  She has less money but is entirely responsible for their kids' college funds? His money is for leisure but conveniently just his own leisure.  I hope part of the money they both have/make is being saved for the therapy their kids are going to need because their father sounds absolutely toxic.
"... Seriously, the fact that she *scheduled* her birth on Ada's birthday *and* said ""we won't be celebrating your birthday any more"" makes me think she has some real issues involving Ada. OP didn't mention any major strife. OP, have you ever gotten the vibe that Jenny was jealous of Ada for being the youngest daughter or something?"
I absolutely agree that the MOH offer is more rubbing it in your face. The MOH position traditionally involves a lot of catering to the bride. Imagine how much fun that would be for her.

"Ah!!  I see you've discovered ""crazy guy with a shtick"" You're still young so I'll tell you a story.

I was once dating a pretty cool girl when I was you younger and she left me for crazy guy with a shtick... his shtick was that he was a hyper genius who's body constantly releases high doses or adrenaline into his blood... I guess it was because he was so brilliant?!?!?!  (quite the shtick, don't you agree?) I mean here was this admittedly intelligent young woman and she was totally taken in by his routine.  His entire ""persona"" was so absurd and dripping with flaming red flags that I was just shocked how she (or anyone) could be taken in by this buffoon.   Oh well... never was one back then for too much attachment so I quickly moved on.  That was over 2 decades ago... since then I haven't had another crazy guy with a schtick enter my immediate sphere but I've seen them around.  Your ex/GF, like the girl I was dating, has some insecurities, and this guy has zeroed in on em.... he'll probably isolate her from everyone, and become more and more erratic... hopefully it doesn't go as far as it did for the girl I dated, a decade late I found out they had 3 kids and it took a shit load of abuse before she finally left him... she's probably messed up to this day "
Your girlfriend really needs to see a doctor. I know where she's coming from about the whole anixiety of someone examining her but you need to be really supportive and talk to her. Tell her you think it is really important that she sees a doctor and because you are concerned for her health. Tell her you're willing to drive her and be with her to make her feel as comfortable as possible.
True but you get those back after I think 2 years and she still could do another house under her name. So that's not too huge of a loss. 
"The new apartment (which is sounds like you **will** be moving into eventually - just not right this minute), the flights to be together, the food, etc...all of those things benefit BOTH of you, enable you to spend time together, and are things that you need, and from that aspect, I find his request reasonable.  Help him out for now.  Sometime down the line, you may need similar help.

The bachelor party, however?  HELL NO.  Bachelor parties are not a ""must have"", they are an option, and his boys should be paying for it anyway.  Not him, and most certainly not you.  Why does it have to be something lavish/expensive?  Can't they just go out to dinner and grab a couple decent cigars?  "

"One of the things she will learn in her future endeavors is that you can't have your cake and eat it too. Asking you to put your life on hold for her while she screws around is very selfish.

High school relationships don't often survive the first year of college, even with the best of intentions of monogamy. If she's already one foot out the door already, then it's incredibly likely the relationship is going to fizzle.

I'd say that that it's time for you both to move on."
"This is emotional manipulation for sure. I've seen it most used by immature men who don't want to be in trouble so they play the pity card with exaggerated self criticisms. I fell for this all the time when I was younger, thinking the guy honestly was beating himself up about it, until an older female friend clued me in.

I'm not entirely sure, but I suspect OP's husband's money outbursts are based more in manipulation than financial anxiety. He might have financial anxiety, but the fact that he spends carelessly himself and only seems to criticize OP's spending publicly makes his behavior seen much more calculating to me--especially combined with the love-bombing and pity-seeking afterward. The question is, what is the husband getting out of this behavior that is more important to him than his wife's feelings? That's the question OP needs to answer first."
"When I say this, I promise I am not saying it to be dismissive, or not taking you seriously because of your age.

At the age you are right now, you're feeling everything at the highest intensity you will ever feel- it's like normal adult emotion dialled up to eleven. Combined with this, you're experiencing most things for the first time, and moments of intimacy like that get pretty intense and head-fucky."

"It seems ""starving"" was his word choice, probably meant to be humorous. Obviously he doesn't need to check in with her for every bite he eats, but if he is placing the cause for that mid-morning hot dog on her, then I don't know if she's out of line for being upset. She obviously puts a lot of care into the food she makes, and to find out that it has been inadequate for years is probably distressing. "

"Well, you can always try letting your husband read all of our responses tomorrow when there are enough people here telling him he's wrong and should support his wife.

Does he respect your feelings at all or what the fuck? What is this guy playing at? Not cool, husbando. Not cool. If you're reading this: snap back to reality PLEASE."
"I HAVE forgotten that I invited someone to a wedding. Ahem. Not a shining moment in my life. I did remember as the time came closer, and was smooth enough that no one ever caught on that I forgot. But I knew.

Op, don't take it personally. This guy sounds like he has commitment issues (7 years without a serious relationship? Who does that?). This is not about you, it is about him.

"Related experience, but different issue, my husband is an alcoholic.

Here's the things I struggled with that it sounds like you're also struggling with:

* You really do love him, he really does love you.
* It doesn't happen all the time, and when it's not happening, the relationship is not just good, but nurturing to you.
* These outbursts seem to be ""not really him"" in some ways.
* It seems like this a problem outside of his control, therefore not his fault, and part of being a relationship is supporting each other.
* But it's escalating: both in frequency and intensity. And it's fucking scary.
* You are on edge a lot, if not all of the time, waiting for the next time.


Here's what I decided:

* I do love my husband and want to support him through his recovery. 
* It will not help him, nor me, nor us, if 'the next time' things escalate to the point he really hurts me. That will kill something inside of him and I don't think we'll be able to come back from that point.
* Supporting him is not the same as literally standing next to him during episodes. Supporting him means taking action to support him in getting treatment, or in recovery. Supporting him does NOT mean making him feel like everything is okay when it's NOT okay.
* It DOESN'T matter that it's ""not his fault."" Another outburst will be damaging. Period. Already I'm having to do my own work to recover from my damaged trust, I can not handle the constant anxiety of waiting for the other shoe to drop. Another episode, and I don't know that I'll ever be able to get out of that place around him.
* It DOES matter that it's ""not his fault."" The fact that he's not CHOOSING the episodes, but that the are the result of other choices means it's not his default setting. There is hope. If he can keep working on things, there is real hope for change. If instead he desired a relationship like we have during those episodes, there would be no hope.

So my suggestion:

* Set clear, easily enforceable boundaries. I suggest you think about what I do: leave. The first small warning sign things are not okay, just leave. Arrange somewhere else you can go, anytime, day or night. Have a small bag packed you can grab, or keep it in the car. 
* Think about what ""progress"" will look like and feel like to you. Communicate to him that you NEED to see that progress to feel it's safe to continue in this relationship.
* Be prepared to leave. Temporarily live somewhere else while he keeps working on things, if he can't get a handle on this fast enough. And permanently if he can't get a handle on it at all, or if the anxiety of dealing with this becomes so great you are not okay to keep dealing. That is okay too.

It is not loving to enable someone to be unhealthy like he is. It is not loving to endure it what it does to either of you."

But if things have been as bad as you say for as long as you say, and she hasn't been willing to recognize it (or was deliberately refusing to recognize it), I'd be wondering ""why now?""

I'd ask her ""Why do you want to work on things now, after I've been trying to do it for the last X months?  The last time I brought it up, you bit my head off.  Why are you only now taking it seriously?""

Her response would decide whether I stayed or left.

Possible reasons:

You work, and she doesn't.  If you leave, she'd have to get a job.

She works, but doesn't make enough to support herself in her current lifestyle.

She's afraid of what her friends/family will think if her marriage fails.

And last but not least, this was enough of a shock to open her eyes to how she's been behaving.

Nothing ever went anywhere but he was always my best friend. I told him everything he told me everything we spent the majority of our time together and then I met the man that I would marry. This friend was repeatedly disrespectful and I finally said ""I'm sorry, we can't be friends like this anymore."" And we went no contact for 3 years. It didn't matter that I had known my boyfriend for less time than my friend (25 years). My boyfriend was literally the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. Those 25 years without him didn't mean a damn thing because I wanted 25 + years with him. We married and I don't miss my friend. Because my friend was the one making me choose. Not my husband. We chat now, though not like before. It'll never be like that again and I'm totally okay with that. "

I had a D&amp;C to remove retained placenta two weeks after I gave birth. Bizarrely the bill I got charged me things like for a test to confirm pregnancy. I was definitively NOT pregnant again two weeks after having given birth (hadn't even had sex yet). 

I think medical billing is not infallible. My theory at the time was that they routinely charge for a bunch of stuff every time they do a D&amp;C, and who bothers to go back and correct it? My ins. paid for the procedure, including for the supposed test to confirm my pregnancy (which was never conducted). "

Because really, OP, what were you hoping to salvage by dogging him? It wasn't that you slept with him ""too soon"" it's that you're this attached after *two weeks*. He was still a stranger.

"This is really true... I hadn't really noticed it before, but I remember when dating, I would tell my husband his sexiest 'comfy' clothes was when he was in a tank top or white v-neck that showed his arms and some dark jeans. Almost always, he switches from his suit to that, and I can't keep my eyes off his chest and arms. The same goes for me when I wear my dresses - he can't keep his eyes on my face when talking all the time!  "
"thanks :) i aim to please. 

you say you ""want him so much"" -- if he gained 40 pounds or so, would you still feel the same way? i'm not asking if you would still have sex with him, or if you would leave him, or if you would still love him...just, would you still want him *exactly* as much as you do now? probably not. you would probably lose some attraction to him. that doesn't mean you wouldn't have sex with him, and it certainly doesn't mean you would fall out of love with him. but you would probably lose some attraction to him...and that's okay. that's the big difference here, between what is acceptable in a relationship when it comes to physical standards. just because he might not be as attracted to you physically as he once was doesn't mean he loves you less. 

but seriously -- i get what you're saying. it is difficult. and it sounds like you could benefit from just...telling him this. he might not be as attracted to you as he was before, but he might also not realize how much his lack of attention is hurting you. and realistically, the more in tune you guys are with each other, the easier it will be for you to get back in shape and be happier in general. 

weight loss/getting back in shape is really a couple effort, even if it's just one person. i'm sure he doesn't want to hurt your feelings by mentioning that you've put on some pounds and he isn't as attracted, but he'll probably be supportive if you tell him that you're not happy with your body at the moment (it sounds like you aren't) and you need some help getting back on track. you mentioned that he's very into fitness and that BOTH of you have overcome weight loss in the past, so recruit him to help you with your journey! maybe he can help you by making healthy meals, maybe he can help you by carving out gym time in what i'm sure is a very busy schedule, maybe he can help you by researching workouts and exercises that can help you meet your goals. 

finally, be realistic about both your weight loss goals and how your body will look once you hit your target. you have twins, and a life, so it's likely that your weight loss will be slower than it was back when you were a kid playing sports. that doesn't mean it's impossible -- far from it -- just that you shouldn't give up because it's taking longer than you remember. it will take longer than you remember, and that's totally fine. also, realize that there are some things weight loss will not change about a post-pregnancy body. things like stretch marks will still be there when you lose the weight. you may have saggy skin. you may not look exactly like you did pre-pregnancy, and that's okay! it sounds like your husband is a good guy with realistic standards, so that's not going to make a big difference. a guy who wants his wife, and the mother of his children, to have the body of an 18-year-old swimsuit model is an unrealistic douchebag. but it doesn't sound like your husband is that guy, because that guy would have left you long ago."

"That money was a gift and intentionally given.  You should NOT give the money back to the wife.  Her husband died knowing how much he had and how well situated he left her.  At a guess, your friend had a decent 401k, a house that had equity, and some life insurance.  If he left all of that to his widow, she was left fairly well off and does NOT need the cash gift returned.

My advice would be to make sure you keep the card or note that came with the check.  Maybe even put it in a safe deposit box.  If you get served any legal paperwork, hire a lawyer and respond through appropriate legal channels.

DO NOT DISHONOR YOUR FRIEND BY RETURNING ANY OF THE MONEY."

Quite frankly, if you don't care that your income will affect her financial aid and ability to afford college because you're offended she didn't want to be ~bff~ with you the moment she met you, than you're being really shitty. 

You're punishing her for existing and for being bonded to her own mother by potentially putting her in a position where she can't afford college because financial aid offices expect you to help. You met her as a teenager, you can't expect her to just jump ship into camp stepmom.

For this particular situation, think about how you would handle this if you were single or out by yourself or out wth girlfriends. ""I have a boyfriend"" is rarely a deterrent for drunk losers who are convinced that they can charm your pants off.  I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to rely on your boyfriend to help you but you also need a way to shit this down on your own when it happens again."

"&gt; Yeah, in Cal. the magic line for marriages is 10 years. At that point I understand that alimony is for life.

Yes, after 10 years there can be ""permanent"" alimony, but this just means that the court has ongoing supervision over the duration rather than just setting an interval."

I agree with you about this potentially being a relationship-ender.  Your friend did everything right, the dog was too ill to save (it's tragic, but it happens...it's the risk we all take when we get pets), and now your girlfriend needs to grow up about it and quit calling your friend a ""dog murderer"".  "
"Im sorry but a woman who maintains this type of relationship isnt looking for a friend. He needs to shut this down, work on his relationship, and then he can make female friends. "
"Get a lawyer. It may be possible to at least temporarily block him leaving the country while somethign is worked out. But depending on the country, you are basicaly fucked"
"Maybe try the call out method. Make her repeat what she said. Louder please. Wait, did you say ""xxxx?"" What does that mean? Hmm, so you're saying I'm ""xxxx""? Not really, why would you think that? Etc. 

Me, I don't have the patience for that shit in social settings. If there's someone that unpleasant the group is putting up, with I'm out. I don't have as many friends these days, but the ones I do have are kind and straight forward. "
And it felt so goooood! 
"OP, your husband is abusive.  Thar sort of public humiliation is inexcusable.  My personal solution would be to turn around and loudly exclaim ""Did you lose money at the gambling table AGAIN?""  Or divorce him."
"&gt;Without dilating, it can be uncomfortable. He said that's how sex is supposed to be for women. 

What. No. NO. Shut this shit down. A man who doesn't think women are supposed to be enjoying sex, shouldn't be having sex with a woman. "
At 14 you don't need to not sound accusatory. Tell him only assholes touch people who don't want to be touched. 
Another poster on this sub did this recently with her BF and it worked really well according to her update. Would 100% recommend.
"Save your hair and don't get dreads! White hair doesn't naturally dread - it mats. Dreads can damage your hair (and hurt your scalp) because it lacks the natural texture to create proper dreads. Even if you wash it, you run the risk of not thoroughly cleaning your hair with dreads. 

Onto the issue: your friend overreacted, and I don't think you're guilty of hating black people or black culture. I would look into more information on dreadlocks and cultural appropriation to understand the issue better, but it's not worth staying friends or trying to make amends with someone who won't give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you just didn't know about these issues. Know that you aren't in the wrong and move on with your life."
Seriously this. Like come the fuck on.
"I'm just going to quote your TL/DR back here: 


&gt;I got over excited at my team (Portugal) winning Euro and in the excitement I called my girlfriend a bitch and a French crybaby a whole bunch of times, smashed a dish at her feet, did rude gestures at her (there’s video) and later on threw up all over her twice when she was sleeping, sprayed her with beer and left without helping her clean.


This is just such extravagantly bad behaviour I cannot imagine this relationship ever recovering. Please leave the poor woman alone, maybe after sending a sincere letter of apology and a gift certificate for a spa or something, and perhaps avoid your next girlfriend at similar moments.


I'm sorry, you threw up on her twice! What are you expecting Ato happen here???"
That is VERY clearly NOT what he was saying (from all the info OP has given us) and you sound like you are projecting. 
"It sounds like you might have covered this already, but just in case, make sure to tell her that it's okay to say yes as well as no. There's a LOT of negative socialization around female sexual desire, so a lot of girls get the idea that there's something wrong with them if they actually want to have sex or masturbate. That feeling of shame and ""dirtiness"" can lead to a lot of heartache, so make sure to counteract that with a positive attitude at home. You sound like a great brother!"
This is not a nice man. Your cat is part of your family. What kind of person asks someone to get rid of their family? (I mean in this type of situation where nothing is actually wrong except his attitude.)
You'd be surprised at how much planning and work it takes to grow food.
"Ohhellno, OP.   She not only wants you to house and support her and her 2 kids for at a year, she wants you to be the nanny for her baby?  Hell, no.   Not to mention, your gf travels and would leave you alone with the woman for days at a time. Hell, no.    At most, allow her to stay 2 weeks while she finds an apartment.  Hopefully, she will be getting child support from the ex bf.  But frankly, the woman needs to live closer to her parents if she has any, than to her sister who she apparently has no compunction about taking advantage of."
"Seriously laughable. Bit judging from the info OP provided about post high school European tours and mommy and daddy funding her undergrad Manhattan apartment, she sounds like a Grade A Connecticunt. 

"
"I don't agree with this. There's plenty of posts where a woman loses total interest in a guy after finding out he has slept with a prostitute. I think this is gender-swapped equivalent to that scenario.

I think some people hold certain intimate actions, like sex, in high regard. When someone ""cheapens"" that intimate experience by treating it like a way to get money or something you can buy, then it seems like you don't have the same values.

A difference in values is a big deal and can often be a deal breaker.

Another thing is if he plans on spending the rest of his life with her, he has to now deal with other people in his life potentially coming across these videos. A huge part of their privacy is gone and there's nothing OP can do about it.

Lastly, she withheld this information for 8 years. Whether she was embarrassed or had another reason, it means she would rather hide aspects of herself instead of confronting them. If she ever put herself in another compromising position, who is to say she will be honest? 

I don't think this thread should be hijacked to spread an agenda or minimize OP's feelings."
"No, most people do not interrupt the things they enjoy if they have a single good date with someone and are not yet exclusive. She didn't know this was an expectation you held at the time. I would be surprised by that expectation also, especially in your late 20s."
I was never cool enough to have a razr. 
"Sounds a bit like she does have something to protect. You. Clearly you haven't put thought into protecting yourself - to me this sounds like she loves you and she's making sure you're protected.

It might sound crazy to you but sometimes people love their partners so much they are determined to ensure that they are protected well into the future. Regardless of what could happen in the future.

She's may also want to show you, your family and your friends that she's not in this for the money. All it takes is one person making a gold digger 'joke' to create a lot of uncertainty. Do people talk about your family wealth?

Make sure the pre-nup is fair to the both of you. In other words, protect her as much as she is protecting you."
...yet you expect moral perfection from your step daughter.
"Just because they don't have children together doesn't mean she isn't entitled to marital assets. Do they own a house together? Joint savings/joint accounts? 401k/retirement fund? Stock? Is he using their joint accounts/marital assets to send his side family money? 

Why do children have to be involved for her to be entitled to the things she and her husband have worked for? People don't have kids all the time and it's not like some court out there is like ""oh sorry, you don't have kids, so you have no right to your money that you have worked to earn and save!"" And if he has been siphoning her money to his side piece, that can be used against him in the divorce proceedings. "

"Ugh, this. I worked night shift for quite a few years. 7pm-7am. People would constantly ask me to meet up with them at like noon or 2pm, and were downright upset and angry that I would ask for it to be either really early or preferably in the later afternoon/evening. They did NOT understand my sleep schedule and no matter how many times of ""it's like me asking you to meet me at midnight or 1am on a work night"" they just *did not get it*. 

Fortunately for me, my husband has always been extremely supportive of whatever my schedule is and is still always quiet on days I get to sleep in (we joke that it's in his best interest anyway; I'm like a bear coming out of hibernation when I get woken up before I'm supposed to). "

"&gt;Even after both of us pleading and begging them to reconsider through text and calls


holy moly cut that shit out right now. her tantrums are officially 100% not your problem. just pretend like they don't even exist, honestly. when she is passive aggressive and tries to guilt trip you like this, your husband just needs to say, ""alright, we were looking forward to the visit, but if you would rather not come that's up to you. See you next time!"" When she tries to argue with his boundaries, he just needs to calmly state them without dignifying her batshit ideas with an argument: ""mom, that won't work for me. I'm sad that you're upset, but nothing I did this weekend was wrong and I have nothing to apologize for. I hope you feel better soon, but I can't continue talking about this. I'm gonna go, but I'll call you on [specific day].""

Then don't engage with her until the appointed time.

Keep up with a regimen of ""[attempts pleasant conversation] [she blocks it out with whining and tantrums] mom, no. I'm not talking about this. [she keeps trying to talk about this] I'm going to go, I'll call you on [day]."" That way your husband is training her to interact with him on his terms. They will not discuss things that he has closed to discussion, she will not guilt him about issues that are not actually issues, and she is not entitled to take time that he is not willingly giving of his own accord.

If he can't take steps toward these kinds of boundaries, pump the breaks on the wedding while you imagine trying to raise kids (if you want them) not only with him, but with his mother and her entitlement to ""her"" family. (if you don't want kids, just imagine this behavior intensifying, and the possibility of her throwing a tantrum when you fail to provide grandchildren/go on awesome vacations without her/etc.)"

"Why did you let your parents be so involved in your marriage?  That was really wrong of you to allow.

The relationship sounds FUBAR, but you should still consoder therapy because you will have to coparent together and will need to learn how to communicate better.

That three men in their 30s couldn't figure out a way to handle this without hurting a kid is beyond me.
"&gt;she said she has never seen me cry and would love to see me be overwhelmed with emotions on our wedding day. 


Eeeeeek.

My partner's the stoic, Zen monk type. I've been with him for edging toward four years now, and I've seen him cry exactly twice:

1. The day we found out that I have a degenerative, lethal gene disorder. He cried for less than thirty seconds, and then just held me very tight, and we made dinner together that night with a bit more care than usual.

2. When he was reading me an article about the Orlando nightclub massacre, and he got the the point where someone was talking about how the cell phones left on the bodies of the dead kept ringing and ringing, as their desperate families tried to get in contact. His throat closed and he couldn't keep speaking for a minute or so, and then he continued.

The thought of _wanting_ him to weep...fills me with unease.  If it were our wedding day, I'd want him to be full of joy and hope for the future. I don't need him to cry. I know he loves me, and that he expresses his emotions on a different level than I do a lot of the time.  I cry over Thai life insurance commercials and books and video games and music videos sometimes, I teared up while watching the end of the Ghost in the Shell TV series last night(goddammit, Tachikoma), and on me that's all good and right and healthy. But on him, it would mean that something was _wrong._  I love the man he is, not the man that I imagine him to become later on, and the man that he is does not shed tears lightly.  We're different people, and that's why we're so good together. Would that tack be something you could use to discuss this with your partner?

Have you asked her if she feels that you generally don't show sufficient affection? Have you asked her why she needs to see you cry? Have you explained that for you to cry, something would need to be badly amiss, and that you are not at all likely to cry when you are happy?

As for all the rest of this...welll. It might not be a bad idea to gently ask her to tone it down. She doesn't want her guests to be so sick of her wedding that they're dreading it before the day ever arrives, after all."
So you didn't get to know her before you married her?

"If you managed to date someone for 5 years without your friend knowing, is he really still your friend?"

"Your last post was three weeks ago, not a couple of months ago. I find it very hard to believe that things have improved so much in three weeks that you have forgotten about the issue.

"I am so sorry for your loss. Were you ever able to get grief counseling for it?


It is definitely possible for others to bond with an unborn baby and to grieve his passing as well. He was a part of your family and was loved even before he arrived.  I understand where you're coming from, but also, I have been on the other side of this and have also grieved children lost early.  Other people's bond doesn't reduce the specialness of your bond with your son.

This is professional counseling stuff. Please, you are worth the time and expense and you deserve help with your grief. "
It's like when people with adult children get together. Sure a relationship would be good but independent adults that have already been raised by someone else aren't really looking to bond. This girl has rejected her advances. If it was important to her husband he would've tried to build the relationship. 
"I've worked with my husband not once, but twice. The first time, we were in different departments (but in a pretty small office overall) for about 3 years. This second time, we worked in the same department, literally sitting across from each other. This one only lasted a year, but only because he left to take care of our son.

We loved working together. It was awesome being able to bitch about work to someone who knows exactly what you're talking about, lol. We could go to lunch together, it was actually great!

That being said, we've always been kind of an attached-at-the-hip couple. Not that we're clingy with each other (actually, quite the opposite - no big shows of PDA or anything like that), but we're both pretty happy spending time with just each other. We're both odd ducks and we click. We don't have  many friends outside of each other. We've also been together for about 18 years so maybe we're past the ""needing our own space"" phase.

I can see how people who aren't like us might not want to work together. I loved it, though."

"Playing devil's advocate here, why does she have to be the one to reduce  hours / give up her work?

If his concern is not having someone around to look after the kids, then he could be the one who stays at home and looks after the kids."
"&gt;It makes it even more strange when she has vigorous opinions on a woman's body about what she can or can't do with it, how men should have no say in it, yet are obligated to be there to raise, provide, and care for the child after their born.

This isn't her opinion, it's the law, assuming you're in the United States. All individuals have bodily autonomy, and all parents are legally obligated to provide for their children. There's nothing strange about this at all. What IS strange is that you don't even know whether she purposely discontinued her prescription. That would be my first question, were I in your shoes.

There was always a risk she'd get pregnant, even on hormonal birth control. You were never having risk-free sex. "
"I'm 40. My sister is 35. My brother is 33. My  first car came from a junkyard when I was 17. I had to learn how to change my oil, change spark plugs, change brakes, change tires and do minor body work. This was my dad's doing, and he wanted me to appreciate the privilege of having a car, free and clear. 
My mother was LIVID about this plan (proper girls shouldn't work on cars,buoy see), so when it came time to get my sister a car, they went to the Volvo dealership and let her pick out the car she wanted, with a much higher price tag than my little Buick. When my sister was 15, she had her cute little Volvo 240. 
She proceeded to wreck it multiple times, and demand my parents fix it. My mother paid for that car several times over.
My father, furious at my mother, bought my brothers first car from a junkyard. And he had to learn all the things I did...
Now, as adults, my brother and I are both married with families. My sister still calls my dad to change light bulbs in her house because she doesn't know how. She demands my mother attend to her whenever she is sick : this last time, she forced my mom to stay with her for 2 weeks and continue to drive her around for another 3 weeks after that.

I don't think its fair to say I am favoring any child over the others, they only live with us 2 months every year and are horrible to me the whole time. Of course in that case I will reward my daughter who is an angel and even my husband said is a better child than the other 3."
"I was in your position once. 
I simply asked my friend what deodorant he uses. He confessed that he didn't use any as he was concerned about the aluminium content. He asked me if he smelled and I said yes, and that his clothes also smelled bad too. It was a little awkward but he was very grateful. I took him to Lush Cosmetics and we chose a natural deodorant. I told him that he has to wear a clean t shirt every day. I have never smelt him since. 
I made sure to tell him when it was just the two of us and I didn't make it into such a big deal either. "
"Let me put it this way: I'm 31, my wife is 33.  She has an MA, I have a BA.  Even with that, our debt is only $110k *combined*.  Together, we have a solid salary grossing around $116k.

We, like a few of the couples around us, just bought a house.  It took me several years of *aggressively* saving to get the downpayment together, get my credit score where it needed to be, lower my debt ratio, etc. Which means that I started this process when I was about 27.

Now, she's looking around and seeing her peers, couples like my wife and I who are college educated with good jobs, starting to buy property and ""settle down"".  

She may have planned to be in a similar situation soon. However, your situation doesn't make that feasible.  You'll get together and then need to spend the next 5-6 years until your finances stabilize. 

Basically, her future probably included marriage, then shortly after a house and kids (if that is what you guys were planning), but now the first few years of marriage is going to be you guys having to closely watch your finances until you're out of this hole."

"The thing is, had she been honestly trying to provide for herself and either failed or just couldn't quite scrape by, or if she had really terrible experiences, I think it would be a bit odd for you not to want to move in with her. After all, you've been together for a while, you see a future with her- why wouldn't you want to help her if she was struggling? Why wouldn't you see yourself as team, and why wouldn't you be willing to compromise to be in a better place as a team?

However, that is not the case. She's been more than adequately provided for and now that she has to be an adult and take care of herself, she's not willing to do anything that she doesn't want to do. Honestly, the way you describe her sounds pretty spoiled. She can't have her cake and eat it too. You want to live in Manhattan, you get a goddamn well paying job or you live with a bunch of roommates (or you're lucky enough to have a trust fund). Or you live waaay up north. She fits into none of those categories and now she needs to accept the reality of her situation. If you still want to make it work with her, perhaps try to come to an agreement: she figures out a way to provide for herself- whether through roommates, getting a better paying job, or living with her parents- for a year or two and then, if all is well, you move in together. Something about this makes me think she will not do this, because she just cares about what gives her the least inconvenience and not what's best for you, too. You may also want to think about whether this is the kind of person you want to be with, someone who thinks things should be served to them on a silver platter.

EDIT: Also, not tacky for her to pay rent. It's necessary. I own an apartment and my boyfriend and I discussed moving in together. He insists on paying half, even though the mortgage is in my name, because it's far below market value and that's what's fair. "
Sounds like you need grief counselling. I would look into that.

Even if the OP said this was purely professional, the fact the parents are coming along means there has to be some leisure component to the trip. The fact the sister wasn't invited will just feed into her belief that the OP is the favoured sibling, further damaging the relationship. This isn't mentioning the fact they'd actually have to keep up the lie every single time the trip came up."

"&gt;He wallows in self-pity. Shouts at me, hits me sometimes (he's really frail so it doesn't hurt, and he doesn't intend to hurt me anyway). He gets angry at himself, at me, at everything. He has no friends. He doesn't like leaving the house.

So, it's very understandable that your brother doesn't want to be around this person.  It puts you in a difficult position though, and it's understandable why you would resent your brother. 


The life you are living is unliveable, and so is your fathers' life. Human connection is important and both of you need more in your lives than each other.


It is natural that you are struggling. Alcohol isn't the answer, but I understand what you're doing and why. Unfortunately it will increase your isolation and depression and contribute to this situation worsening.

"OH yeah, I have been down this road. Right after I got married my new husband took me out shopping, and then tossed all my old stuff while I was at work. He then spent the next 7 years trying to make me what he wanted. Everything was controlled.

It starts out small, though I bet if you really think back there have been minor control issues you have glossed over, but they get worse. She doesnt want you, not the real person you are, she wants you, the person *she* is going to make you. This is conditional love. Find someone that is willing to take you unconditionally."
"The issue isn't that she bought all new clothes.  It's that she threw out/donated all the old ones.

Throwing out his old stuff that she knew he liked was not done for him.  It was done for HER.  So yeah...  that sucks."
"&gt; ... or worse yet, situations that he created himself?

This is the most terrifying thing about OP's situation to me. Marriage and kids have enough hardship intrinsic to them WITHOUT someone making up bullshit problems. OP, you are signing up for a relationship that will not only be hard because relationships are hard, but because your partner thinks it should be harder for you and will construct situations to ensure that additional hardship.

You could go to counseling like a bunch of people are suggesting, I guess, but unless there's a TON of other stuff he's offering and this is the one point of frustration or concern then if it were me I'd just get out of there now. He's already made things hard enough for you, keeps putting you down, treats you like an inattentive child, and it sounds like he's just going to keep raising the bar until he's certain you can't reach it. You don't have to live life on Dante Must Die mode; normal difficulty is already tough enough."

"You play, you pay.

Stop complaining about her personality — it's irrelevant, you thought she was good enough to have sex with, you therefore assumed that the results of sex were good enough, too.

However, it's also possible she's hooking up with someone else.  If the child isn't yours genetically, you can avoid the child support.  But unless you have any reason to believe she's been sleeping with anyone else, it's almost certainly your kid, and yes, this would be your first child.

And in the future, unless you know and love and trust any girl you're having sex with, *use condoms*."
"Some perspective from someone dealing with a similar situation: 

The question ""why not adopt?"" Is a really hurtful question to get as someone dealing with infertility. It's almost like the person asking the question thinks we're just hitting ourselves with a hammer and gets a brilliant idea: stop hitting yourself with the hammer! Wow, Im so stupid, I never thought of that! 

When in reality, they have thought about it, and for many of the same reasons you choose to have Billy and baby#2 instead of adopting, they would like a go at having their own children. 

It seems like that's the point in the conversation where your sister takes a more hostile turn. 

Email is a pretty terrible way to be having this conversation. The four of you should sit down and talk it over. "
"&gt;**I'm not even sure how it happened**, obviously the condom failed **or he didn't pull out in time or something**

Well golly, this sure is a puzzle.

Talk to him. Tell him you're keeping the baby, whether he's involved or not. If not, you will be pursuing child support. Just be prepared for having a deadbeat father of your child because unless he changes, he doesn't seem that interested. It seems like he brushed it off, out of mind, like it's just going to go away and resolve itself. But he still needs to be financially responsible for a kid.

And ffs, do not use the pull out method. You are proof that it is not reliable ""birth control""."
"Sounds like depression to my (untrained) ear.

"She did tell him that. She didn't agree to that stuff, but he was constantly complaining about it. The vacation was a trip to a destination wedding for his sister, who she is also friends with. The apartment is wishing her means, but he complains about it constantly. Same with groceries (he complains that they don't shop at high end grocery stores). "
"&gt;Any advice on trying to fix this?

At every step in an interaction with someone else, check for reciprocity.

Someone who is enjoying spending time with you will generally reciprocate your gestures, not in a mimicky way but in a natural way (smiling when you smile, asking questions at about the same rate you do, moving toward you when you move toward her, texting you as often as you text her, etc).

Someone who isn't particularly enjoying interacting with you won't reciprocate readily. 

Don't push beyond the level of intimacy your interlocutor wants. If you reach a step where the person is pulling away, or saying they have to go, or turning down an invitation, or giving one-word responses to your questions without offering ways to extend the conversation, that's your signal to stop the interaction there rather than pursuing further (literally and figuratively).

Periodically ask yourself: Is this interaction pretty well balanced, or is it fairly one-sided, where I'm doing most of the talking or making most of the effort? Try to match the effort level and communication frequency of the other person. If you notice things becoming unbalanced, pull back a bit to give the other person space. 

Offering too much too quickly will definitely make other people nervous and less inclined to want to spend time with you. Don't rush to make someone your new best friend or love interest. Trust takes time to develop."
"Yup, I agree with this.  This may be me being cynical and overly practical but my immediate thought is that you can't trust this woman when she says that she won't contact your husband and tell him on her own.  Honestly based on her history of dishonesty it's safer to assume that she will.  So you don't just have to consider whether it's better for your husband to know or not, but how he'd react to hearing it from her and learning that you already knew.

I'm so sorry you've been put in this impossible position.  My instinct would be to tell him, but you know your husband and your relationship better than we do.  All you can really do (if you decide to tell) is try to break it to him as gently as you can and support him as he grieves and comes to terms with it--reassure him that he did nothing wrong, that there was nothing he even could have done with the information he had, that you love him and that he's a wonderful father to your sons.  Internet hugs to both of you."
"&gt;  They even made sure she had health insurance

"&gt;She was laughing and said ""it's okay it's just really not appropriate."" Then said ""I'm just jealous"" and laughed.

She's being inappropriate. Policing your outfits like this, and then saying she's jealous of your boobs? Not cool.

For your own piece of mind, do a quick check in with your actual boss, something like, ""Since I'm new to office work, I've been working to build my professional wardrobe and I wanted to double check with you - is what I've been wearing the past few weeks okay for professional attire?"" I bet your boss will say yes, and then you'll have confirmation that you're fine. If your boss doesn't say yes, then you can talk with *your boss* about suggestions for improvement.

Any further comments from the gal who's policing you &amp; you can say, ""I've talked with Boss about my wardrobe and Boss told me it's fine."" "

"Wow. Your husband is acting like a misogynist. 

Whether you do selective reduction or not is up to you. Whether you to IVF or not is up to you. But you have to ask yourself if, right now, this man shares your values.

Right now your husband is telling you that he values having a boy over your health. He values having a boy over having a girl. He values a boy over your current pregnancy. He values having a boy over just about everything. 

If you do not share these values, your husband is showing you something very scary, and I bet it's extra-scary since you are currently pregnant with multiples. I do think that you did have some warning about this- he was already emphasizing a son before you got pregnant- but now it's not deniable anymore, it's right in your face and it is scary. 

If you do not want to selectively reduce, if you do not want to do IVF in the future just to have a boy, then you need to tell your husband that now and see a counselor right away. The two of you need marriage counseling. If he will not go, go alone. And if he won't go, then you need to think hard about your future. "

3. Have the guy go over all the line item costs, taxes, registration fees, full coverage insurance requirements while under finance. Make sure to use an amortization schedule to show the interest paid 

4. Tell him as soon as he gets a job, has a down payment, buys a full coverage policy, he can apply for financing and trade in his gift.

As a frequent reader...I am *so* excited. I shouldn't be. But I am.
"Myeah. I'm also a woman of colour dating a white guy. My boyfriend is indifferent about the social and political issues I care about. It'd obviously be nice if he was just as interested, but whatever. However he doesn't show contempt and ""fingers in ears, lalala-ing"" as your boyfriend does.

If he ever started outright dismissing the stuff I say, telling me I'm ""too liberal"" or ""care too much"" for wanting to put an end to structural and social oppressions, or derailing every conversation to make it about his feelings, I'd be done. Because he has the luxury and privilege of just looking at race issues from a distance, as a ""concept"", whereas I experience them personally; he doesn't get to tell me how I should feel about racism and if he ever started, that would be my cue to leave.

He doesn't need to be as aware and up to date as you are, but at the very least he should make you feel safe enough to talk about these things."

Definitely not mature enough or ready to get married
If they already booked travel there isn't much you can do but let them know you don't want to be in contact with them while on the trip even if they are in the same place. It sounds like your fiancee doesn't really trust you and this passive aggressive move is a way for her to keep an eye on you. Let her know that's how this feels and regardless of their plans yours won't change. I think you need to have a serious calm talk with your fiancee and ask her to change her plans if possible and discuss why she doesn't trust you. 
"He will be required to pay child support at least, assuming he doesn't manage to get majority custody. If you've been stay at home or went to part time he may be required to pay alimony. You should keep notes on everything he says and does, a description of the behaviour with dates and times. Save anything you get in writing from him including texts, emails. Take photos of them, back them up. That will all help you. You say he loves your daughter but if he doesn't treat her well regardless (yelling, any kind of neglect, letting her do dangerous things) take notes of that as well for custody discussions. The courts don't like to leave children with nothing so if you're acting as her parent he will have to contribute financially for her sake."
"Don't worry,  get a bag of chips, sit back and watch her marriage fall apart.  "
Agreed- OP knows he's on thin ice anyway because he never texts her around his wife.
"Wow, yes, you did the wrong thing. You did the wrong thing when she was young, you did the wrong thing never finding her again when your feet were under you, you did the wrong thing spending the money her father left to help take care of his family--you know, his kids? Her?--and you are definitely doing the wrong thing judging her now. She's a bit passive-aggressive? In your shoes I'd count myself incredibly lucky if she wasn't openly aggressive from the get-go, considering you ruined her life."
"thank you for the hug.  

turns out he didn't have neuroblastoma, though they looked in vain for the tumor for weeks.  he just had the shitty neurological problems and resulting disabilities that usually go along with it, from which he still suffers 21 years later.  eight months ago they DID find a tumor.  in his brain.  he underwent brain surgery in february.  but as for actual neuroblastoma, he didn't have that, as it turns out.

when it comes to neuroblastoma, there are two options:  death, or lifelong disability.  my son fell into the latter camp.

so i suppose i'm more sympathetic to this nameless mom than most might be, because my son could've easily been hers. i can only imagine how i'd feel if i'd kept his existence a secret from biodad, only for him to die before his tenth birthday after a long illness.  i'd want dad to know, but i wouldn't feel inclined- after having kept it secret - to storm my way into the life he'd carved out for himself.  i'd probably choose to leave it to  his new partner to decide.

it's worth noting that i personally wouldn't have told them at all.  but had i chosen to do so, i would've left it to the wife to decide, out of deference, respect, and acknowledgement of my previous youthful lie.

folks seem to be forgetting this woman was a kid (based on the husband's current age) at the time she found herself pregnant.  who the fuck makes good decisions at that age?  it's awesome that we can all armchair this and call her an ""asshole,"" but as someone who was only 20 when i was going through a similar thing, i can only imagine what i would've done had i a) kept the kid a secret from his dad all this time, presumably intending to do so forever, and b) then been faced with said kid's death before he left elementary school.

i'm in no position to judge this woman; to my mind, nor is anyone else.

"The next time he calmly informs you he's having doubts about the relationship, tell him ""Then you need to do some serious thinking. We've discussed marriage. I won't do this whole 'I'm not sure about you' thing every few months for the rest of my life. It's emotionally taxing, and building that kind of imbalanced relationship dynamic will not lead to a happy marriage. You don't need to think I'm perfect, but you can't take out your stress on the bedrock of our relationship because it hurts me. If you keep doing this, at some point I will believe you and I will have to leave and find someone who isn't doubtful he wants to be with me."""
"Why do you have to ""fix things""? Why can't he try to fix his problem, of getting unnecessarily irritated about stuff that wouldn't bother a normal person?

Being in a relationship means respecting the other person's individuality and differences. If he doesn't like certain things about you, it's his choice to break up with you - NOT berate you and try to mold you into someone else. Why doesn't he get that yet at age 35?

I think he's bad news - but if you *have* to try to make this work, at least don't move in with him until these problems have disappeared. That means he needs to acknowledge that he has a problem and do some serious self-improvement work - he probably needs to see a therapist. 

You might benefit from therapy too, for your stress issues. But please remember, the things you listed - like being a vegetarian and not drunk driving - are *not* an indication that you're defective. He is."
Of course he said that.
"&gt;I have no idea why she reacted like that.

&gt; she was honestly beyond reason

&gt;I tried to stop her but she was insanely stubbon.

&gt;I am at wits end and have no idea why she is reacting so strongly.

She probably doesn't want to talk because you sound dismissive as fuck.  You make it sound like her reaction is just some pesky little thing you need to ""explain"" her out of having.  I don't really see your relationship coming back from this.

Also, what nerve to assume you are just some spoiled rich kid ( and, even if you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth, she still wouldn't be entitled to any of your money). 
I wouldn't be too surprised if she is lying about not receiving child support.

"Alright, it's half-time, let's sum up:

* Your Ex left you for her, stating ""she's like you, only *better, in like, every way*

* She doesn't feel remorse or even a hint of self-consciousness

* Your parents don't validate your opinion and belittle you for having them.

TLDR: Your parents are either blind or clearly favour your sister. Your sister is an egoistical prick. Your ex is a oafish asshole.

Verdict: Yeah, no way in hell do you need to go to that wedding."
"&gt;It worries me to think that she could have gotten you an invited but didn't want to, maybe because it would be more fun for her to be there on her own.

You don't get it.  The thing that made it exciting for her is that she was able to sleep with *new* people.  OP has been in her life for **four whole months**.  She can't possibly get that much excitement from him after all that time.  She needed some strange. C'mon.

"While your idea of contributing some small-ish gesture is a kind idea, I'm betting that the gentleman probably had a life insurance policy which covered the cost of the funeral/arrangements (and then some) and that those costs are long settled and paid. 

I also can't help but feel that the widow did the friends of the deceased a great disservice by not letting them know of their friend's passing, and details of funeral arrangements - even if ""very small and private,"" it still would have allowed those not in attendance the chance to make the gesture of having a flower arrangement sent or some other acknowledgment. 

And while it's not as if the man gifted OP &amp; her husband his entire life savings, he *did* think highly enough of the couple to make a sizable financial contribution to their newly-beginning life together, during the time when he knew his own life was coming to a close; to be thought of in such a way, at such a time, speaks volumes on the importance this man placed upon his friendship with OP &amp; husband. I don't know how much better a friend one would need to be to have merited an invite to his funeral - and *that*, I think, speaks volumes about the wife, and why the gift was given in the way that it was: while he was alive, acknowledged and documented with an accompanying note (in his own handwriting) ensuring that the sum **is a gift**, the amount *is not a mistake* and that he genuinely *wants* them to have the money...

It lead to me being as miserable as she was.  As time went on and I started to pull away, her desire to feed her unhappiness grew and grew as she became more vicious to my independent life.  It was fantastic, it really builds character to have such a narcissist so intertwined into your life.  It will surprise non of you that fiance was actually my boyfriend first, and while we were still dating sister slept with him.  Well he left me for sister, which is totally cool, his dick was small and he lasted all of 2 seconds.

I have had to ask him direct questions to get a lot of this information which is making me feel really uncomfortable because he isn't volunteering easily.

I have never once complained about the car except once when I was driving cross-country and discovered that I didn't have cruise control. It was a long trip but the car was still the best. 

I couldn't imagine complaining about it to someone who did something so nice for me. I offered to do the shopping, pick her up from work (she took the bus b/c of parking), and anything else that I could think of that required a car to thank her. 

A kid who complains about a free car shouldn't be getting one."
It's the legal drinking age in most provinces
I don't think it's adorable. I think a 17-year-old should have a better grasp of human sexuality.
"&gt; About 3/4 of south Koreans are Buddhist and don't really celebrate Chrismas. 

Out of curiosity, where did you get this statistic from? I know a fair share of Korean people, and most of them are Christian.  As far as I know most Korean-Americans are Christian.

"You're not selfish at all. What I can't tell from your post, probably because you don't know, is where your boyfriend stands on this. He can't be legally forced to support her, so the question is, can he ignore her manipulation and guilt trips when the time comes? Will he feel obliged to take her in or will he have the strength to turn her away?"
"It's possible that everyone else is seeing something that you haven't consciously acknowledged, *or* it's possible that they're misinterpreting what's going on. Only you can really figure it out, and it might take you some time. You could try to look back at how you thought about Kyle's brother, were you impressed, attracted or intimidated? That's just one example of something to reflect on. You don't have to have it all figured out right now. And it sounds like you have a great friend, there.

Oh, and I never did address your central problem of your parents' behavior. Can you tell one of them, ""I know you guys think I'm gay, and I really think I'm not. But either way, *I* have to be the one to figure it out and tell *you*, and every time you refer to it I feel pressured and judged. If you really love and accept who I am, please stop."" "

I was devastated when I had to put my childhood dog down, but I was happy he wasn't sick any more, he wasn't alive and in pain just so I could feel a little bit better about myself. I think it's part of being a pet owner, you are responsible for putting them down when it's clear they don't have the best quality of life you can give them. It's awful and upsetting, but that's the price you pay for their love.

People too, for that matter. Different, of course, but so similar."

You are doing a brilliant job, it is time to talk your BIL he is also sticking his head in the sand, and I believe he is also in denial, he also lost a child. I think it also might be a good idea to get your nephew to write a letter in how he's feeling and then show it his dad.

"I had the same situation in college and told the guy to stop. Worked for a week then he kept spanking his monkey (in addition to staying up until 4 am yelling at his league of legends friends over skype).

OP, tell him to stop jacking it (I told him while he was on skype with his buddies to further embarrass him the second time) and if that doesn't work get an RA/dorm manager involved."
"Does ella have any relatives she can give Lily too?  stumblepretty has a great response.  But if ella is a typical new mom, she doesnt care about the groups happiness, only herself getting a little escape, even if the rest of you are miserable. 

I would be firm but as a group make it clear Ella should not bring lily, for LILY's sake.   Ella will try to guilt you into letting her come, downplaying the concerns, etc etc. . you know better.  

Ella is your friend, but as a new mom, she has not accepted the fact she cant hang out with the rest of you because of the kid. it sucks but thats really life works give the scenerio you have described. "
"Are you always this dense? Let me repost again (what the OP said) to clear it up for you:

**He** [my dad] already knows this; **they're** not planning on sending any more money. The initial £200 was just to buy them some time to think of what to do.
**I** **don't** agree with them sending the money **(it happened before I was aware of the situation)**, but it's **already happened** unfortunately.

Maybe that will clear it up, huh? As you can see, it's NOT Op's money and it happened BEFORE OP knew. Jesus. "
"Umm he needs to stop responding to her texts. There would be no need for you to even think of confronting her if he just shut this shit down. 

It doesn't sound like you are angry right now, more understanding in light of the aging thing and simply worried. So maybe just tell him, look, I understand the attention is great from a hot young thing, it's a great confidence booster, and I totally understand how someone could want to spend time with you or fall for you; but for the sake of our relationship, please stop responding to her texts. 

Edit:  I'm assuming he knows that you see him texting with her, so that you don't have to tell him you snooped. I'm kind of steering clear of that issue, other redditors may advise you to come clean about that. "

"&gt; I planned to go shopping for 2 hours. Within 15 minutes of leaving, he started blowing up my phone asking me how to help my son with something. He had promised to do this while I was gone. He complained that it was taking too long and would make him late for meeting everyone at the brewery. 

So he gets unlimited bro time, but you can't even take a two hour shopping trip without being guilted for it? Personally I think you're *under*-reacting rather than overreacting. If he doesn't want to spend time with you, then at least you should be able to do stuff on your own."

This poor woman woke up to find that a) she's carrying another life inside her and b) her husband has *already* left the hospital, moved out, filed for divorce and **printed flyers about what a whore she is for the whole neighbourhood**. I hope those neighbours find out what a POS OP is too. I hope everyone does, in fact if I was the wife or a friend of hers I'd be making some leaflets of my own. She must have been so humiliated, I can't imagine. Jesus Christ, I think I'd almost prefer a scarlet letter..."

"&gt; he will argue that I led him on, which I can’t really deny

What do you mean, you led him on?  Having normal or even slightly flirty conversations with him does not mean that you've granted him permission to say whatever he wants and you don't get to complain about being uncomfortable.  Tell him he's abused the privilege of chatting with you outside of work, and you don't want any more messages from him.  If he ignores that, then you're well within your rights to go to your supervisor or HR."
"Well, op has been trying pretty damn hard to talk about it and he always makes feel like she's being ridiculous and unreasonable, and his behaviour doesn't change. Just how much talking do you need before you actually walk the walk?"
"You're totally right about the possible dementia. I just want to add that even if the grandfather had no idea what he's doing and wasn't to blame at all, that still doesn't mean the OP should let it go, ignore it, or put up with being assaulted."
"agreed, but tyler is only 20, was drunk, and had just been lied to for 2 weeks by someone he thought he was building a relationship with.  this isn't an excuse for his behavior, but it's a pretty good explanation."

"Female here...ask her how she would feel if you threw out the clothes, purses, shoes, and makeup of hers that you didn't like. She was out of line for throwing your stuff out without permission. "
"Yea, and the late 20s - 30s I've noticed, as have other friends, that there this kinda of natural cull that happens when it comes to relationships. People mature and grow apart, it's normal. OP needs to admit he's outgrown his friends BS and has found a real gem in his wife."
"That's fucked up of her, I'm sorry "
Jesus. Your bf is threatening to kill your paralyzed dog because he has accidents. I'd be keeping the dog around and rehoming the boyfriend. There are ways to express that he's unhappy with the situation and this is NOT an acceptable way. Plus if I'm reading correctly you've had the dog the whole relationship. He fucking said he'd kill your helpless dog. I'd be out so fast his head would spin.

"I would not be with someone who encouraged me to abandon a pet for no good reason.

On our first real date, my husband came up to my small apartment to chat after dinner.  He didn't properly close the bathroom door and my cat walked in and stared at him, mid-piss.  I knew he was an okay guy because (a) he was laughing as he tried to shoo my cat out of the bathroom, while he continued to pee and (b) my timid cat was actually willing to approach him at all.

A guy who doesn't understand that your pet is a loved one to whom you have a commitment is lacking something (empathy, soul?)."
It turns into a debate about what is sex. If two guys give each other a blow job is that sex? Why is a straight blow job different? If a guy fingers a girl it's not sex but if two lesbians did it it is? It's not simple anymore. The simplest version I've come up with is that being sexual together where an orgasm can be achieved is the same as those two had sex together.
"I'm really disturbed about another thing in particular. She has the same degree and works in the same field and makes monumentally less money. Are your career paths and/or skill sets that drastically different? Or has she been underselling herself? If it's the latter then why haven't you encouraged her to seek a different job opportunity? Do you not think she is capable of it?  Or are you just totally cool with her getting hosed as long as it's her problem and not yours?


If I found out that my partner was making so much less than he could be I'd tell him exactly how much I was making."

And with OP being like 'my kid is my kid, your kid is your kid', it's no wonder that Sara doesn't have much interest in her stepmom and didn't like her at first.

As someone whose parents remarried when I was a teen, kids pick up on it when the step parent thinks they are 'not my problem' or 'your kid, your circus, your monkey, not mine', even if you think you're doing a good job of hiding it. My stepfather thinks the same way. It didn't take me long at all to work that out. "

"The short and simple of this is that you would well be within your rights to divorce her based on this. This isn't something you agreed to, in fact you actively opposed it and she did it anyway. 

The mood swings, the lack of sex, the postponing of you guys having kids yourselves and the loss of income, not to mention the health risks she's taking it all seems incredibly selfish even though she is doing it for someone else, it doesn't take into account that you should be her priority since that's how marriages are supposedly supposed to work. 

So, you're not being unreasonable, you can choose to trooper through it, but you've barely hit the halfway point and you already have a high level of resentment towards her. 

Do you even want to stay with her? "
There is no compromise on childbirth
I do. She's my baby...I can't stand the thought of her in pain. It breaks my heart to see her so heartbroken. I will look into therapy...we do live in a rural area so I hope it won't be hard to find someone qualified to help her.

"We've passed 9 years married and are heading into 14 years together. He is away on a business trip and gets home in a week or so (he'll have been gone for almost a month). While he is on that trip we decided to start playing pokemon go (he in the UK and I here in the US) because more exercise is important now that we are in our 30's and 40s respectively. I've created a series of walking routes based on the pokestops for us to walk the dogs in the evening.

He travels a ton for work and I love that he gets the opportunity.  I'm jealous in a healthy way. We have solidified our plans for our next international vacations. Caribbean in January and Europe in May before his travel cycle for next year starts up.

Since he is away right now he requests photographs of my garden and the tomato harvest.

All in all he is a great dude."
"You mentioned in your comments that almost everyone you've dated has been suspicious of your best friend, despite him being in a relationship and married, and despite you saying otherwise. Your boyfriend even flat out asked you about it. 

You could just have a perchance for dating men that are naturally suspicious, but my hunch is that you and your best friend act more inappropriately than you think. If everyone you date is suspicious of your friend, it isn't because he's a dude, it's because you're probably doing something or acting a certain way that's making then suspicious. 

Unfortunately, you lied, which makes you look even more suspicious. All you can do is tell the truth, apologize, and offer to do whatever it takes to gain his trust back. 

I would take a step back though and take a hard look at your friendship, and maybe even ask some mutual friends about how you act. You could be surprised as what other people say about you and your best friend. "
Neck injuries should always be checked out. You should probably go to an emergency clinic of some kind just in case.
"We are childfree, so probably no kids. Which is another thing my MIL is always hounding on! even though my husband has already had a vasectomy of his own accord but she may not know that, as it's private -- he's told her since he was a kid that he never wanted kids though and continues to, so that's a place he stands up at least, but she just ignores him and he doesn't seem to mind. She steamrolls him too, but that's their dynamic and he's used to it. He says it's just the way she is and so does his brother, Brian, but I'm not used to letting anyone treat me that way and am a bit more assertive.

I feel like my husband is on my side, to be clear, but he just doesn't assert it and figures ""that's just who she is and too late to change her"" about his Mom. He will make excuses why she can't come over or ask her not to drop by while I'm working, but he asks politely and when she disregards him, he just shrugs. He also acts like she's a dog with a chew toy who will just tire out eventually, but the chew toy (me!) is not having a good time! "

Step two: Skylar is right. If you don't have a court issued custody agreement, get one. Limit contact with her unless you are discussing your child. 

Step three: Apologize to Skylar for allowing Lacy to treat her badly, while you stand back and watch. Lacy nearly attacked her and your viewpoint is they were going to fight ""like girls do"" and the only reason they didn't it that the police station was nearby. Why the hell did you not step in? Were you just going to watch your girlfriend get beat up by your ex?

I'm confused.  Is your boyfriend her brother or is her husband your brother?
"This is what I'm trying to point out. Not taking birth control didn't cause the pregnancy. Having sex causes the pregnancy. I've not taken birth control for years, and never once got pregnant from it. 

I know I'm getting downvoted because what I'm saying isn't a popular perspective, but the whole reason I'm trying to point it out is because you can't control whether or not you have a child at this point. But you can control your own bitterness, anger, and resentment.

You didn't take the risk seriously when you had sex. Take it seriously now. Take responsibility for your part in having a child. Take it from someone who has to ""co-parent"" with a narcissist, throwing blame only makes it worse."
Your comment is a perfect example of someone who spends too much time on this subreddit and/or watching drama shows.

Maybe ask in /r/legaladvice or talk to a lawyer about claiming what's rightfully yours because I'd bet this guy will do whatever he can to keep you out. If you're in her will, it was obviously pre-meditated and she obviously wants you to have something. Find out what it is and if it's worth putting up with this guy's shit, claim it and give them the bird on your way out the door. "

"As a mom who lost a baby at 16 weeks, I couldn't imagine willingly giving up a baby I was excited for and grew to love, especially since everyone is doing well.

Your husband needs to understand that the important thing now this far along in the pregnancy that selective reduction might not be a choice. It is usually done 9-12 weeks into a pregnancy. (I had to vaginally deliver my son at 16 weeks it has to be done this way post 13 wks.)With multiples,more than twins, the risk to the other babies is even higher than reducing a twin to a single. 

Sex of the babies shouldn't matter. Healthy babies and mom should be.

Do not get pressured into this if this isn't something you do not want. I personally find it vile to end a child's life solely based on his or her sex.

"&gt; I love my boyfriend but we may very well break up over this because I can't get away from her, he doesn't believe me, and i'm at my wit's end.

I think you may need to **MAKE** him believe you. Sit him down, and tell him how you feel. Tell him that if he doesn't take your feelings seriously, you're done. Tell him that if he gets up from the chair/couch, so much as stands up, without fully acknowledging the situation and believing you, and working out a solution, you're leaving. Then, tell him how she is bullying you. Tell him you're no match for her socially, and she's outwitting you.  Be incredibly firm. Yell if you need to. Make him see and FEEL how much you're hurt. Guys aren't as empathetic as women sometimes, so he probably needs some extra help to see how you're really feeling. 

I get the feeling you were hurt by this behavior by her, worked up the courage over a long time to address this with your boyfriend, without coming off as a crazy girlfriend, and when you finally did bring it up at the 'right time' you were discouraged when he immediately 'shot you down' by saying oh, she wouldn't do that. She didn't mean anything by it, she's a nice girl. And you gave up, without really driving home that fact with him. If he was perfect, he'd have fixed it then. But he's not. That doesn't mean you can't fix this, he may just need some extra persuasion.

You need to make him realize she's different towards you than everyone else, and you don't deserve to be bullied, you deserve respect. 

Take that respect!

Have you sat down with yourself and thought about if / how your actions may have lead your girlfriend to behave in this manner? She does sound a bit insecure (we all are on some levels) and may be doing this as reassurance that you're not having an inappropriate ""friendship"" with this female coworker. I don't think that you are doing anything wrong by being friends with this coworker (if it truly is a friendship); however I would suggest openly talking to your girlfriend about her behavior and put her mind at ease about her concerns. Have you suggested she join you and your coworker for lunch one day, so she can get to know her and see that she has nothing to worry about?

I despise those lines. A lot of people use that line to be emotionally manipulative. They will say it's an option hoping that you'll think they are more sorry than they really are. That way when you don't leave they take it as all water under the bridge. Call her bluff and watch how understanding she really isn't.

"If you're late 20s and financially stable then your parents don't really need to know or understand your life choices. I say just do what you're doing and be happy.

From my perspective though, the fact that they accept your brother's choices suggests to me that their issue is coming from a place of concern. They've seen you try lots of different things already and now you're talking about hanging out and discussing philosophy/religion/anarchism. They're probably happy and supportive of him because he shows a level of focus that they haven't seen in you. It's not a bad thing to be interested in a lot of different subjects but I can see how it could be worrying to your parents.

They're possibly at a stage in their parenting where they're worrying about how you'll cope when they're gone. 

Don't ask them for any money, do it on your own and reassure them that your lifestyle is sustainable and that they've played a massive part in creating an inquisitive mind (if they have)

"My husband's aunt, who was a hoarder, died 2 years ago (Edit:  Also in the bathroom). She left a horrific mess in the condo she owned, as well as leaving no will and owing a bunch of people work she had contracted to do and accepted money for. Everything was a mess and my MIL (the executor of the estate) was barraged with people demanding this or that. It took over a year to go through probate and get things sorted out, as the aunt had neglected to pay taxes for some years, as well.

Throughout all this, my MIL was continually harassed by a business associate of the aunt who claimed the aunt had property that belonged to her (she didn't), that the aunt owed her money (she couldn't prove it), that the aunt had made her various promises about her possessions. Her daughter was an attorney and she sent my MIL several nasty threatening letters. 

Once the estate cleared probate, my MIL's attorney sent a simple letter to the disgruntled partner and her daughter/attorney. It said something to the effect of:  *""The deceased's estate has been closed and all verifiable debts have been paid in full.""* MIL never heard a peep from them again.

You don't have a moral obligation to pay this landlord money that you don't have. It was in horrifically bad taste for her to ask you for items from his home and harass you while you were trying to process his passing and see to his ""estate"" (such as it was). She has insurance to cover the cleanup costs and depending on the value of the goods she received from you, may have received enough to cover her deductibles.

It is on her for not knowing the condition her rental house was in and taking steps to rectify the situation. While your father is to blame for his condition, she is to blame for negligence in her duties as the property owner. You can sleep soundly at night not giving this woman a dime.

I'd recommend having an attorney draft a letter similar to what my MIL had sent to her persistent creditors saying the estate has been closed and all legitimate claims discharged. It can also be pointed out that the landlady was in receipt of most of the items of value from the estate and there was nothing of value left.

Edit:  You also should not have signed anything assuming responsibility or making any payments for the cleanup or damage, but what's done is done. I hope it doesn't come back to bite you in the ass."

It sounds like you are tip toeing into an emotional affair. What is your wife going to think when she finds out that you've been texting a secret friend every day at work and going out to lunch dates with her.

There is no shame in that choice. Your girlfriend obviously loves her dog very much, but if she cannot easily gather that $6,000 by herself, then the surgery shouldn't be done. 12 years is an old age for any dog, and surgery would be risky anyway. Perhaps you could try and gently broach this subject with her so that she can make sure to spend a lot of time with her dog before he dies and think about saying goodbye. "

"&gt;help her open up and be more mature

Is that in her words, or yours? Either way, being anxious and introverted doesn't make one ""immature"". You're only two years older than her, and this entire post reeks of a parent-child relationship, not a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship.

&gt;often seeks comfortable things

You need to expand upon this. Is she self harming? Is she reverting to childlike behavior that you're unaccepting of because you deemed it ""immature""?

&gt;Sometimes it would end in me shouting at her

Yep. Not good. Shouting is not okay, especially at someone you describe as extremely anxious. Of course she's afraid. I can understand that you were upset with her hiding things from you, but shouting at your partner is never okay.

&gt;Right now she's grown up a lot and we don't have any fights over these subjects

The way you describe her makes me cringe. What makes her ""grown up"" now? Because she isn't doing those ""comfort things""? I'm only assuming here, but I'm guessing it's self harm. I hate to tell you, but adults and ""grown ups"" self harm. [If I'm wrong, forgive me, but you're being so vague in this post..] At any rate, you seem to only think she's grown up because she isn't doing activities that you disapprove of. That's creepy and gross.

&gt;she feels like she doesn't have the freedom to do what she wants, only what I want her to do.

Well... Is she wrong? If she does what she wants, she gets screamed at. If she hides it, she gets in even more trouble.

&gt; I feel I was being strict for her sake

Strict? I've never heard a boyfriend or girlfriend describe themselves as 'strict' unless they were in a DD/Lg dynamic, and if that's the case for you then my advice would be slightly different. But if you're not... then yeah, you're not her parent, you don't get to be ""strict"" with her, like she's going to get grounded if she disobeys you.

She needs therapy, OP. An actual, legitimate therapist, not a 'strict' boyfriend who yells at her when she does an activity he disapproves of."

Go through each thing, one by one, not to accuse, but to explain how concerned you are, and that these are NOT normal, NOT just little ""oopsies"" or being busy - these are extremely serious issues that need to be addressed right away. 
 
She either has a medical condition such as ADD that needs medical treatment (and there IS treatment that can help her!) OR she is truly irresponsible and unfit to be a wife and mother. It's one or the other.  So explain that for the sake of your marriage and your child, she MUST see a doctor and get to the root of this issue. If the doc finds something medically wrong, and can treat her, that would be wonderful, and hopefully you will see some improvements over time. (She still won't get a job, but at least this is a step in the right direction.) If a doctor does not find anything wrong, OR if she refuses to see one, then you know that she is woefully irresponsible, and you can start divorce proceedings, knowing that you truly tried to address the various issues in an assertive way. You will want to get a lawyer, and use the documentation of all of her incidents to help with custody. 
 
As for the job - all I can say is this. If someone were supporting me, and didn't make me work, I wouldn't work either. Work sucks. Nobody likes work. Of course she's not going to get a job. She doesn't have to. You pay the bills and there are no consequences. Maybe if no one was funding her stinky worm farm operation or whatever, she'd have an incentive to work. "
Me neither. Shit's fucked up
"First, be honest with your daughter. Tell her that your sister is jealous and acting irrational. That it's not your daughter's fault and everyone else is equally confused as to how sister is over reacting. You want to give your daughter heads up in case she tries to contact her aunt and gets a massive guilt trip in return.

Second, leave your sister alone. She is almost 40. She'll get over it when she gets over it. Nothing you can say or do will help."
"I don't think there's any shady reasons he's keeping from me. I mean, he took our son there. If I had a secret girlfriend or was involved in drugs I wouldn't be bringing my chatty two year old along for the ride. One slip up and he's telling Mommy about ""the pretty lady who had a sleepover."" 

No, I've never spoken to his family. I've asked if they know about me and he says they do, plus, like I said, he's taken our son back there at *two years old*. He was a total chatterbox at two. It would be hard to make sure he didn't mention anything about his mom while there."
"A man who cheats with you will cheat on you, as you're starting to see. "
"You're a dad, no matter what.  You have total control over whether or not you're a deadbeat one."
"Yes. This is what's really not sitting well with me.  Just because he got to the reduced hours finish line first doesn't mean everything she's worked for doesn't matter anymore.

There's no one way to have a family.  When I was a kid, my mother worked full-time and went to grad school.  My dad is 11 years older than my mother and had more flexibility in his schedule so my parents worked as a team taking care of my siblings and me. I had a great childhood and so did my cousins who were all raised by two working parents in demanding careers."
"From both a professional and personal standpoint, it's extremely inappropriate for him to be commenting on the attractiveness of a subordinate, hanging out one-on-one or texting outside of work.  

It's not difficult or offensive to say, ""I'm sorry, but I don't message or socialize with employees outside of work.""  That's pretty much the advice that you already gave him.

If he's not setting boundaries, it's not because he's too nice or she's too persistent... it's because he doesn't want to.

"
"I feel awful for that poor girl, she's probably afraid to live next to him."
"Dude, your wife is pissed: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4sl27b/my_husband_34m_bought_a_house_without_telling_me/"
"Thank you. OP's girlfriend steamrolled him here, and I'm not sure why the top comments aren't reflecting that. 

I mean, she used this line to convince him:

&gt; I wasn't necessarily enthused, but she said that if I ran along an opportunity to explore my rare kink, she would want me to take it.

It's manipulative as all fuck.

"
"If Saturday was the only day of the week my boyfriend could see me, and his friends were available during the week... I'd probably expect to see him every Saturday, unless something big came up. 

If you'd said ""hey my cousins bachelor party is tonight, but let's get together tomorrow after ball"",  that'd probably have been enough.

 I don't think expecting to spend one day a week with your serious bf or gf is asking too much, is it? I'm not sure, I've been living with mine for so long and we love spending time together. Maybe the issue is more deep- incompatible expectations."
"&gt; ""Well you're her only daughter and she's probably not getting grand kids, can you blame her!"" 

If she wants someone to do girly bonding stuff with, there are plenty of volunteer organizations out there that will gladly connect her with little girls who would love a grandma figure to spoil them.  If she wants a relationship with *you*, she needs to be willing to let go of her preconceptions of what that relationship should look like and meet you on your terms, including being respectful of your time.  So yes, you *can* totally blame her - but more importantly, your husband needs to understand that just because you recognize where she's coming from doesn't mean you need to do all the adapting here, and that a bit of distance may not only be warranted but necessary if she doesn't get that.  Especially when trying to force this is more likely to kill any hope of a good relationship between you two than him backing you up on trying for something more natural."
"""Hey, mom. I finished fucking off, and I know nobody cares adopt my martial arts, but since I care about it, could you sign this?"" That's what I'd say. "
"Your EX-boyfriend texted you, you mean. "
"Take pictures and give a police statement now while it's fresh. If they've done it once, they'll do it again. People need to know there's consequences for they're actions, that's some really fucked up sociopathic shit and really needs to be out in the open for the health and safety of everyone involved."
"I think you read the comment wrong. They were talking about teaching the children about the manner of tourette's syndrome, you literally took it the opposite way. Unless you think excluding kids from weddings is wrong. "
"This is such a great update, wow. I'm so happy for you, your husband and your kids OP! "
Probably not. According to you there wasn't even a choice to cheat.  You're just so self destructive and have so little self control this stuff just happens to you. Best to let her go now before you hurt her worse 
"**You are not being promoted to management because you made a bad management decision for bad and unprofessional reasons.**

You sacked someone competent and hired someone incompetent. And to make it worse, you did it for personal reasons.

You are not SUITED to managerial level work. Your lack of promotion reflects that. 

You have only yourself to blame. 

*Oh and your wife is naeive and stupid and unreasonable and unrealistic too*"
Now's a good time to use the block function on your phone. 
"&gt; My boyfriend and I usually attend stuff together and don't hang out with the opposite sex one-on-one without an invitation to each other. it's not really trust, it's just respect.

My wife and I both have numerous friends of the opposite sex, and we don't believe that simply being in a room alone with a person from the opposite sex is immediately going to turn into a fuck-fest, so could you explain to someone like me why you deem it ""respectful"" to never be alone with someone from the opposite sex? I know it's kind of off-topic from OP's post but I'm very curious. "
"&gt; How about the fact that she's visited him for 4 years and he never had a problem with it until he mentions he female coworker and his GF getting in the way of interacting with the coworker.

Yeah, damn. It's weird how she has been doing this for YEARS without it being a problem, and suddenly it's a huge PITA just because it inferes with his coworker time.

Also, this is a coworker that he hangs out with outside of work, so I think the gf has a right to be worried."
"Yes definitely.  I feel like this is a common problem for *any* lifestyle change.  Just went vegetarian?  It's awesome!  Just started crossfit?  It's awesome!  Just traveled a lot?  It's awesome!  

"
"&gt;he is not allowed to have her over if there is no adult supervision, he can't close his door, he needs to text them and tell them where he is. He is not allowed to go to her house if her parents are not home. 

Dude none of this is particularly weird or outrageous for a 15-year-old. 

I'm sure it's not what the kid wants, but it's not going to kill him either. Also your family just met this girl a week ago. It's entirely likely or possible that as they get to know her better, they'll ease up. 

This does not sounds like something you need to stress out about right now. If Owen is sufficiently motivated, he has probably found plenty of places to fool around with his girlfriend outside of the house anyway. "
Good job! After reading your old post I'm happy to see this result. Especially this quick after the original one :)
A middle name is different from a first name.

"I disagree. My dad remarried when I was 17 and my mom when I was 18. I view both my step-parents as parents of me. I probably have better relationships with them than I do my own bio parents. 

I think it's normal for teens to be put off by a new person in their life. I wasn't the friendliest to either of my step-parents in the beginning but they both made effort to have me in their lives. Eventually I realized what great people they are. 

Maybe this isn't popular opinion on this thread but I think you're the adult here and she's the teen. You could make an effort to improve that relationship. 

I'm not saying you should drop 20K but saying, ""not my kid, not my problem"" seems a little heartless. You love this man, can you not love and help his children too?"
"If he won't apologize or acknowledge wrongdoing, does he at least offer an explanation for why he thinks it was okay to give them away? What he did seems so obviously wrong."
"This isn't about his diet. Your BF is just an asshole (and perhaps a narcissist, too). He feels that he is superior to everyone else. He doesn't care about anyone else's feelings. He doesn't care about what you want. Even if you manage to make a compromise about food, he's still going to be a judgmental, controlling asshole, and that will make you miserable in hundreds of ways. 

It's easy to think, ""I just want him to go back to the wonderful guy I started dating!"" But people are on their best behavior in the honeymoon period. The person you're seeing now is who he really is. "
"&gt;I'm not intelligent enough to code. 

I really hate the way this attitude is king right now. 

That is one kind of intelligence among many that for whatever reason is considered ""real"" intelligence. 

I really am bored of STEM dicks assuming that they have a monopoly on smarts. Nope. Not even a little bit. 

Linear problem solving is one kind of thinking and it's very limited in a million ways."
"does she have a hard time taking any responsibility for her own behaviors? ""not my fault! I wouldn't have thrown that rock if they hadn't made me so mad!! They MADE ME DO IT!"" and stuff like that? Are people either all good or all bad? No in-between?  If so, total red flag for major personality problems."
"First of all, your kids will have a ""normal"" family. Divorce is totally normal, and your kids will be fine if their parents can be mature enough to co-parent.

You sign the divorce papers and let your wife leave. You are continuing to hurt her by not letting her go. OR, you hope to hell she agrees to marriage counseling and closing the marriage. But if she doesn't -- let her go. You fucked up and it's time to pay the piper. Not only did you cheat, you but confesses so that your own conscience was clear, even though it hurt someone else. Again."
"Yeah agreed. That's not abusive OP, that's you stating your thoughts/opinions. She's crying because she's upset, not because you are 'abusing' her. 

I think OP is giving her FAR too much leeway on this."
"WTF? That's not the sort of thing that a child would just make up. You did the right thing taking her to the doctor. It could have been serious and she needed to get checked out.

Not sure what you can do with your parents given how childish they're acting but you can give them a fake apology so that you have access to your sister in case she needed your help again with something else. Sounds like your parents are the sort that keep letting down their children. If situation got worse, contact CPS or whatever equivalent in your country."
He's also not a piece of shit for flat out not liking kids. I am incredibly uncomfortable around children for any length of time because I just don't know how to interact with them on a kid level. I can't imagine having to police my own behavior for that long in my own home after establishing directly that I never ever wanted to.
He's not over her yet.  Sorry.
she seems to be in some serious denial about her life.
"...pray tell, why on earth would your opinion on hereditary vulnerability to alcoholism and addiction mean a thing in the face of well-established medical knowledge? I could say that genetic links to heart disease are BS and that it's wholly a product of life choices and environment, but I'd be wrong."
"Your gut instinct was correct.  Re-read the things you wrote about him, and think about what you'd advise a friend of yours to do in this situation.

Stay broken up.  "
Yeah the fact that he's having to repeatedly change his phone number and block so many contacts and she's still sending letters and gifts proves that she still doesn't give a shit about his opinions or desires. She's still bullying him. Reframing the behaviour as disrespectful and harassment *might* make them see his point of view better.
"It's not a matter of ""if he's some pedo"". A 39 year old in a relationship with a 15 year old is absolutely predatory and inappropriate, no question whatsoever. "
"I'm pretty conservative about drugs (I don't smoke or drink, and don't use pot or anything else), but I do have friends who use pot regularly, as well as use molly or coke occasionally. 

Most of them seem to handle it fine, but I can definitely understand being leery of this type of behavior in a romantic partner, and I would be very cautious myself. 

I would take a wait and see method. If her behavior/ routines change over the next few weeks where she starts using coke again despite telling you she wouldn't, I would end the relationship then, as it seems like too much hassle for a young relationship to take. "
And he won't remember it either. 
"Agreed 100%!!!! I also have chronic insomnia and can relate to this so much. If I manage to fall asleep and you are the person who wakes me up, good fucking luck to you. I would be out of that relationship so fast. It's one thing if you wake somebody up by accident, but this asshole is clearly doing it on purpose. DTMF x 2! 

Also, your husband sounds awesome! "
"""I'm not comfortable with us sharing a bed anymore unless it's leading to something more."""
"I dunno, i'm not very critical of people who are grief stricken.  The foundation of good relationships is the capacity to work through the other's shortcomings through effective communication.  She might be awesome, but dog death is her can't-keep-it-together big issue.  I'd take that over a lot of other major personality flaws.  I mean we all have them. "
You've been doing steady date nights every week for 10 months and she tells you ahead of time she's going to miss one for a family dinner. Sounds like an entirely valid reason and a tactful delivery. You may be overreacting
"I suppose I'm seeing things through my own dirty lens. I have no patience for people who claim to love someone they haven't dated. You don't know you love someone until you've had to pick up their laundry, squabble about bills, etc. Seven years is an absurd amount of time to harbor an infatuation with someone. And to act entitled to her? That screams nice guy to me. "
"So she takes your interests into consideration every time she plans a vacation, does things you like to do with you even when they aren't her thing, encourages you to take the sort of vacations you like with other people, and works her ass off to support the family. 

Why is this not enough? Do you have some notion that if you just harass her into hanging out in the woods for a week, she'll magically realize that she actually loves this thing that she has done before and knows she hates? Or do you *like* the thought of sitting in the middle of nowhere with a miserable wife for days on end? 

Dude. She has offered you every compromise. Respect that this is not, and never will be, her thing. Enjoy the dad-daughter time and stop badgering her."
"&gt; Then I hear her knocking on my door. I open and she is standing there bawling. I didn't even let her talk I just picked her up in my arms and held her. We both cried for about 5 min.

One day you'll look back at this situation and you will be angry because you allowed her to humiliate you like this."
"One thing I noticed about your post is that you made everything about you and how you feel. Out of this entire post, you spend less than a paragraph talking about how he feels and how he has been affected by your cheating. There are probably quite a few reasons why he did it and I'm thinking the biggest is to show you how it feels. I don't think you understood the hurt and pain he went through, but now you do. At least, you didn't have to deal with the lies and deceit like he did.
Advice: Seek marriage and individual counseling. I would also try to be more sympathetic to your husband.

Your actions have consequences and now you know this. "
"To paraphrase a comment I read a few weeks ago:  

If a delicious soup is made with 95% fresh ingredients, delicious vegetables, and 5% shit, no one cares what the rest is. It's still shit soup."
"I find the best way to discreetly deal with mispronunciations is by saying the mispronounced word correctly to them in casual conversation. If they are reasonably intelligent, they will recognize that you are saying the word differently than they are. Then they will either call you out on it or realize they were wrong. If they call you out on it, you can then correct them without it being awkward. "
I seriously wish I knew this girlfriend. She deserves to see this thread.
"I know it's late but I haven't seen anyone mention this. Sounds like a classic half-truth situation. To relieve his guilt he told you a half-truth. sounds like there's more to the story, of course I could possibly be wrong. It's a very weird story and situation and doesn't really coincide with the amount of guilt he was feeling considering he was crying and throwing up. With that kind of reaction I would expect him to actually have cheated or done something worse than just hit on some girl"
Idk why you're getting downvoted. This is exactly what happened. 
"By far the best comment in this thread.

News flash kiddo, it's natural and healthy to branch out from your high school friends and start a start a life together with your WIFE and incoming CHILD. Those are the 2 people that should come first, no matter what. 

Your judgmental friends are holding you back. I'd talk a long hard look at yourself and figure out why you're holding onto the past and not looking toward the future of your family. "

"Are these people you had relationships with before?

It takes time to make new friends - especially if those new people already have established friendships. Adulthood is busy, I'm always open to meeting new people, but my priorities go to those I know and am comfortable with. 

You shouldn't be taking this as a personal affront. Not responding to people who reach out is *not* going to help your situation. You should be asking them to do more things to strengthen any bonds. 

Romantic relationships are a whole other battle. How far along in a relationship do they tend to move on to someone else? Have you had the commitment talk by the time they chose to leave? "
Could you translate it to the Gaelic equivalent of the name? Or hyphenate it with another name so it doesn't sound quite so recollective of memories of alcoholic family members?
I think we are all downvoting her because it's like she thinks that having the kid will make him suddenly be her boyfriend when he is obviously not interested? Because she made a ridiculous birth control decision for a FWB?  Hell I don't blame her for wanting to keep the baby at all I am a single mother who had my son at her age he is 10 now and our life is great no regrets here. But I knew what I was getting into. If she can do it great go for it but she really needs a reality check. 
"You're doing the right thing. You're distancing yourself from toxic behavior and your parents encouraging you to hang out with him and apologize makes me seem like they enable his behavior. Just because he has gone to rehab doesn't mean that all his ducks are in a line yet (and from what you've said, it sounds like he's still figuring out things). 

As for what you can say to your parents, tell them that you refuse to enable his behavior and honor his insults. If he continues to work on himself and learn how to not be insulting toward you, you will consider letting him back into your life. For now, you'd like to keep a distance from him and not talk to him unless absolutely necessary. 

edit - grammar. "
"I'm not that guy, but ""I need to learn myself so I i don't die alone"" just screams low self-esteem. It's nothing to be ashamed of, I have a self-esteem problem as well, but if you really want to be the best you you can be, you should see a therapist to help you work through this."
"You get stuff for your partner because you are a team, because you have each other's backs.  The wife broke that.

Pregnant women don't *have* to eat the things they crave btw."
"You assisted in her coloring a fucking picture. 

You're fine."
"Your fiancee is being utterly ridiculous.  Your 2nd cousin is being entirely reasonable.  She's had skin cancer FFS!  Do you really think that she should risk her health just because your childish fiancee wants everyone to look the same in the wedding photos?!  What complete nonsense.  

I'm absolutely with your 2nd cousin - your fiancee has made a demand that she is not comfortable with and has taken the adult decision that it's better for her not to be in the bridal party under the terms that are being demanded of her.  If I were her I'd be out too.  

Yes, your fiancee is stressed out over planning her 'ideal' wedding but it sounds like her empathy and humanity have gone out the window.  Her being happy on her wedding day is important, but not at the expense of someone's health and wellbeing!

You need to get your fiancee to apologize, say she understands that she was being unreasonable, and a) would like your relative to be in the wedding party no matter how pale she is, or b) tell her that she understands why she won't be in the wedding party but would love her to attend.

Good grief!

EDIT:  What happens if on the 'beach tanning' day someone else gets burned and ends up looking like a lobster for the wedding?  Or they don't get 'brown enough' to match everyone else?  Would they be out too?  Hopefully those scenarios are enough to show how idiotic your fiancee is being - she's really not thinking clearly and practically!  "
"Why does she need to come by the office? It sounds like this is a new job, a new wound (knowing all those folks are conventionally attractive and she may feel badly around them), etc. I'd just let it be for a bit. It's fairly unusual for wives/husbands to be dropping by work all the time anyway. Bring it up again at the office Christmas party or something that a spouse would naturally attend. "
"&gt;Should I tell someone?

YES! If you're in school, talk to a teacher or the principal, or the nurse. If not, do you have any adults that you trust enough to speak with other than your mom and dad? If that is not an option, look up Child Protective Services (CPS) for your state/area and give them a call and tell them what happened. 

Your father's behavior is NOT normal. And a father has no reason to ask his 13-year old daughter to show him her breasts like he did."
I think many people would choose to share that story than allow their partner to believe that they're lying about having a child. 
"He's a kid trying to convince his parents he has an adult job, and one way to do that is to show them his tax return."
"Newsflash women like sex.

"You're horrified at his behaviour?! Who the hell agrees to have any houseguest for two weeks without consulting their SO! You've backed him into a corner and are being incredibly unfair. This is his home, he's entitled to be comfortable in it. He doesn't like kids and doesn't want one in his home for two weeks. You knew when you married that he didn't like kids.

As a (supposedly) child free person, you should be familiar with ""bingoes"" from other people about why you should/will change your mind and have kids. Well, that is exactly what you are doing to him by coming out with crap like ""he's only a kid, he's not some leper"", ""it's only two weeks..."""
"Your ex cheated on you and physically attacked you. You literally owe him nothing and I see no benefit to you other than maybe experiencing some schadenfreude, which tends to be short-lived satisfaction anyway. He gets the ability to try to win you back which will probably reignite his passion and lessen the chance that he'll leave you alone.

Plus, you're in a new relationship with someone who I assume makes you happy! Definitely go enjoy a functional, mature relationship and let him just stew and think about what he's done."
I'm kinda curious why she can't just go to the store herself.

"nope.  send her a cease and desist letter and if she doesn't stop, contact the cops about harassment."
It's ambiguous. The title suggests the whole relationship is secret but  yeah who do they think she lives with? 
"Have you ever thought about what might happen when he learns how to prevent you from getting some alone time to calm down, he's already figured out what will make you come out of your hiding place and prevents you from going to the bathroom."
"So I've already said that this behavior smacks of abuse (you requesting a boundary, him ignoring the ever-living-fuck out of it), but if you're looking to work on this relationship, perhaps mention to him that if he didn't fuck with your sleep when you're GETTING it, he could have more time with you in the FUTURE. But all that said, it's not that he's inadvertently waking you up. he is purposefully doing everything in his power to deprive you needlessly of sleep. "

"It doesn't look bad. It was bad. You need to tell your wife, and never see Adriana again. "
I'd recommend anyone who wants to advise OP reads through his comment history. He has some serious entitlement and anger issues when it comes to women.
"Everyone else has suggested about the cat hair.

Obviously your brother is upset he no longer has his pet at moms house. 

Take him out to get ice cream, and explain what happened. Ask him to hold his breath ""really hard"". Explain how you hurt more than how it hurt when he holds his breath. Explain that it could have hurt you very very badly. Apologize that his dad lied to him, and that shadow had to go away. Help him understand on his level. But dont try to take away his anger, because hes allowed to be upset. 

Maybe you could get tested to see if you're allergic to other types of pets. Then maybe you and tommy could go pick out a pet together, like a bunny, hamster, guinea pig, lizard, fish, or other pet. "
"About 15 seconds of work, not that outrageous. It took more effort for them to type up a response than to look up the weather."

"It's just foreign to me. I never had it in high school because the girls there were prettier than me, so it was never an issue. It sucks. "
"I agree. How could you ever get pregnant with this woman again. My stomach hurt so much reading that, but she has no remorse. Whether she had any justification or not based on his lying by omission about his friend (and I don't think she does) this is still probably something most marriages can't move past.  If op wants a family this is obviously not the woman to build it with.

"
"Er, I wouldn't say that. All human children below a certain age are naturally kind of stupid. There's no two-year old out there that can go extremely long periods of time without supervision."
"His lawyer would have drafted something based on OP's requests. OP thought it was fair to exclude the business as a marital asset while providing no consideration for his wife as a SAHP (the thing he says he wants). If she'd signed that first draft, she could have ended up impoverished in retirement if things went south. 

I think that says something about OP's character. He wanted her to take on all the risk while signing away all her rights. 
"
I think OP and his wife should have a chat with the grateful son and let him know it is absolutely OK for him to refuse to give his brother rides anywhere. 
"He a WILL get physical to you or your mom again, especially because you aren't going to the police.  Not going to the police only leads him to believe that he can get away with it.  It's not you who is ruining his and your family's life, it's your father when he decided to get violent."

He sounds like a troubled kid. He probably needs someone to connect with."
"I read the comments before me and initially thought ""fuck it, go and make a fool out of him"". 

But have you ever heard of the advice not to feed the trolls? Its because their hunger is insatiable. And to try and out-game them is akin to wrestling pigs in the mud. It doesn't matter if you win or lose, they will still enjoy it. 

Best case scenario, you both go and start a scene (and there will be one) and ex walks away happy he caused strife. You can't make him feel foolish, you can't win, because to him winning is playing. Once you play the game, he has won. 

So take that away from him. Do not play. It may seem like a victory to him but he doesn't want to go to the party. he wants to annoy you. This is the best course of action, to annoy him by not playing. "
"Tell your parents whatever they need to hear, and then make sure you can privately tell your sister that you are there for her if she needs you in the future. 

Your responses here make me very concerned for your sister's ongoing safety. Please do what you can to be in her life so that she has someone she can trust. If you can't do that, make sure whoever is responsible for child welfare in your country is aware of the issue. Documentation now will help later, if needed. "
"I just had a situation with my best friend where I had to politely tell her no over something that was 100% reasonable, and I knew she was going to get upset regardless but I asked around to people the best way to tell her... and in the end she still freaked out on me. The problem with really close friends is you start assuming you can kind of do whatever you want in regards to each other and any amount of the other saying ""no"" gets taken waaay to personal.

My friend came around a few hours later and though she didn't apologize for freaking out, said she didn't want to be mad and was over it. I doubt your friend will stay horribly mad forever."
"Dude, I used to be in a relationship and went vegetarian with her, and I really enjoyed my sneaky snacks because she'd eat and cook like we were birds. Pick pick pick, nibble nibble nibble, done for the day! 

I always thought it was cute that she fed me, and enjoyed sneaking food in on work breaks, but didn't have he heart to tell her I was a foot and a half taller and sixty pounds heavier, I needed some food man!"
"&gt; men toss around tiny, skinny, girls dressed in sports bras and hot pants.

That sentence makes you sound very insecure and jealous, and it's not really related to acroyoga.  I've done acroyoga and almost no-one was tiny/skinny or wearing hot pants.  Most of us were normal people in normal work-out gear.  Besides...you don't need to worry about them, you just have to know if you trust HIM or not.

As to the spiritual connection, that is a valid concern.  If he is going to acroyoga because he deliberately wants to spiritually connect with another woman, I would consider that cheating.

&gt; Am I being crazy and jealous?

Partially, yes.

&gt; Or is this a valid reason to break up?

Yes.  Anything is a valid reason.  You have wildly different beliefs.  You only tolerate his beliefs but you basically think they are hocus pocus and born of an uneducated mind, so you're never going to accept his validations for things.  You're incompatible.  Tolerance isn't exactly a good foundation for a relationship, it should go beyond that to full acceptance, which you two don't have."
Seriously... Someone who negatively effects your health on purpose is not 'good to you'.
"You have already wasted two years on this liar, in your position I would not waste a moment more. Just get away from her, use whatever excuse you want, it really doesn't matter. Stop being her safety net."
"Why on earth would she approach you, a stranger, and not your husband?"
"I think that's a bit over the top. They did support her for 3 years straight. They even made sure she had health insurance.

Depression and anxiety might be debilitating, but the only person suffering from it can take steps to make it better or manageable. 

We often give advice that if someone isn't taking the steps to help themselves in a relationship, then it isn't selfish to leave or stop trying to help someone that won't help themselves.

One thing I noticed is OP had insurance, but stopped going to therapy. That could be seen as someone not taking the steps to help themselves.

OP, when did your parents hit you with this bill? From the wording it sounds like it was before you got this job. If that's the case, then I think your parents decided to change their method of helping you.

I think they felt like they were enabling your joblessness. They went from helping you in every way for free, to putting some pressure on you to pay them back. This pressure, as my parents would say, ""put some fire under your ass.""

I honestly don't think your parents actually expect you to pay them back. I think they wanted you to have a job and that scary number led you to it.

I think you need to make a game plan for yourself. Figure out how to move out and become independent again now that you are back on the road to recovery. 

I also think you should reopen this payment conversation with your parents after you see what your expenses look like and have an honest conversation about if they expect money and how much from you before throwing the people that have helped you for the past 3 years out of your life."
There is no way he was told this piece of information and doesn't remember. The moment he started dating Kate your husband should of sat down and told him what happened. Most people wouldn't want to be with someone their sibling had sex with let alone a 3some with their SIL to boot. You guys messed up.
"He stopped talking to them because his dad is a violent alcoholic and his mom supports him, not the other way around."
Psst.. He is not much different from the friends he is insulting.  
"You really need to have the conversation with her. Nothing will make it less awkward. Something like, ""When you're in your room with your boyfriend I can hear you two and it makes me a bit uncomfortable."" would be more than enough. I'm willing to bet either your mom doesn't know you can hear or doesn't intend to upset you. "
"You're already being too nice. I usually tell them myself once, file a complaint with the landlord twice, then I proceed to calling the police (which I've only had to do once. It's very effective). I need my sleep and I'm a huuuuuge bitch-monster if I don't get it."
"Frank's genes fucking suck, not to mention! He has a brca gene? If they had a girl she'd have something like an 80% chance of breast cancer and 30% chance of ovarian cancer, and early onset. Not sure how it affects males, if at all. Women with known brca genes struggle with whether to surgically remove their ovaries and breasts in their 20s and their risk begins long before most choose to have children these days, not to mention they have to decide if they're willing to pass it on to their own kids. Ovarian cancer is often aggressive and deadly. I can't imagine being so self absorbed and obsessed with continuing my genes that I'd willingly give my female kids a 50% chance of that outcome. "
"I agree, up until this part:

&gt;this man's fiancé just went from, ""I don't want to do anal or explore sexually,"" to ""I don't want to do anal or explore sexually with you.""

And this:

&gt;morally, socially, and legally locking him out of the same level of sexual exploration she herself had previously indulged.

There's this underlying assumption that she somehow *owes* him anal because she did it with another guy, and the fact that she won't do it somehow means she's not attracted to him the way she was with other guys. This is the bit I'm taking issue with, because it displays a complete lack of empathy for women as sexual beings. A lot of women try anal because they feel pressured into it, or that they have to be the ""cool girlfriend"". They then resolve to have more self-respect in future relationships. *It's not necessarily about him*.

I'm not disputing that she behaved shittily, otherwise. If this was how she felt, she should have communicated it. But this stuff about her ""denying him"" sexual exploration just grosses me out.

Edit: I'm not saying that trying anal necessarily means a lack of self-respect - I like it a lot! But there are plenty of women who don't enjoy it but do it out of obligation."
"?? He's literally done nothing wrong. Before they were romantically involved he shared a preference, since they got together he hasn't mentioned it, and has actually explicitly said that he would love her no matter her body size. "
"Right!?

I'm a housewife for the last 12 years. It's literally my job to wash, sort, fold, donate, trash, buy clothes. 

I still do not toss or donate shit unless I double check with my husband and daughter about each item."
Wise. Very wise. Feel them out for a while before making any big commitments.
"&gt;so am I being a dick?

Yeah, you really are.  I don't believe you either."
"I'm not sure where you're getting 'platforming on social media all the time' from. In OP's post the *specifically Facebook-related things* are as follows:

* ~~The *Aloha* criticism, which rose to prominence over a year ago around July 2015.~~ edit - Not even this example, it was a conversation: ""When I told him how upset I was about Emma Stone being cast as a half Chinese woman he told me I was making a big deal out of nothing.""

* An article about male Asian leads, and the rise in articles about the lack of Asian male leads came out around April/May 2016. 

* edit - That's **one Facebook post about these issues**. 

As for the rest of what she mentions, she seems to be saying that these are either in chat with her boyfriend, or in face-to-face conversations. These are *private conversations* between the two of them, so I'm not really sure where you're getting those claims about her spamming social media, where she must be a Facebook user like your friends where ""every post is some sort of social injustice"", since *that's not in OP's post*. 

Parts of OP's post that indicate these conversations are not taking place in a public place on FB:

&gt;""For the record the last things I sent him...""

&gt;""I talk about minority issues and female issues a lot, they're very important to me. In response, he almost always get defensive and almost intentionally misses the point."""
Right. What if the cat was an orphan and a nun and doing Race For Life next week.
"&gt; She also told me she bought a pack of cigarettes and smoked 2 of them before her friend told her to throw it out. Before that, she hadn't smoked in over a year because I asked her not to anymore. It killed me because I really thought she wanted to make those kinds of positive steps in her life for more than just me, but I was wrong.

You kicked her out and broke up with her and she smoked two cigarettes. That ""killed"" you? Good thing she's single you sound controlling and narcissistic."
"I actually have to disagree on the birthday celebrating. I am 23 and I still celebrate my birthday. Sometimes huge parties,  sometimes just a small dinner with close friends,  depends how I feel"
"Maybe it's time to forward her the link to this thread, so she can see what objective strangers think of her behaviour. Clearly she's fobbing off family members who're trying to manage her unreasonable expectations.

Semantics matter when it comes to what statute an act falls under
"I agree with virtually everything you wrote, but why the threat?

&gt; You need to examine yourself and think really hard about what is important to you. I cannot and will not support you in this. ~~If it is more important to you that you~~ You can't continue to bash my friend for trying to help you instead of realizing that bad things happen. ~~then I am afraid we won't be able to continue as we have.~~""

FTFY. 

Seriously, who wants to be in a relationship where every important conversation ends with ""We need to see eye to eye here or I'm leaving""? It's just not how rational adults discuss things. She's obviously distraught and what she's doing is not OK but not everything has to be an ultimatum.

Edit: I'm getting some mixed responses so I'll repost what I wrote below. I think everybody's tendency on /r/relationships (as is the case with the internet at large) is to assess everything from an angry, emotional POV, but try to think about it logically:

The threat is counterproductive. Think about it this way: There's two choices, and two outcomes for each.

1. No threat, she stops: Great, she's convinced.

2. No threat, she doesn't: Fine, they break up.

3. Threat, she stops: If the threat is what makes her stop saying those things, then he's failed because she still feels that way, and now she'll just stew about it quietly and he won't know.

4. Threat, she doesn't: fine, they break up.

So what is gained by the threat?"

He's an asshole who doesn't deserve her in any way.
"&gt; Like I said, there are things that matter more than a job. Few things matter more than family. The fact that she remains there shows a complete disregard for her family and shows that she's not committed to fixing the problems.

I get where you're coming from, but jobs are just _not that easy to find_. If OP is in any way qualified for anything, they will not hire her for entry-level positions like service/retail because they know she'll leave as soon as she gets a better offer. And not all companies even have other branches, never mind ones with the same positions, and even then she'd be lucky to find an empty position similar to hers in an office she can commute to, and then to get the company to be willing to move her.

While your theory is valid in principle, it is insulting naive to suggest someone can or should quit their job without a new job ready."

Ada was open to a combined birthday but Jenny said no.
"That's on you though, not on her. And from what op has said, it's not like they talked much, if at all during those 5 years. That's a long time to just hope someone's feeling the same way you are without acting on it at all. And extremely selfish to take it out on others like it's their responsibility. Some accountability has to be there."
"&gt;""you put my dad behind bars, threw me to the wolves and now judge me for surviving you fucking cunt?""


Well her dad got into drugs on his own, but the rest of it, I'm with her. Seeing her siblings and building a relationship with them doesn't make them unsafe. FFS you could have her over for dinner, or go out to dinner together, or go to parks. 

You tossed out a 6 year old because you couldn't be bothered to care for ALL of your children and she was your least favorite, and now you can't be bothered again. 


She's 18 and she *needs* money to survive. You have no fucking clue how difficult it is to get launched, much less get launched out of the foster care system. 


It just makes you feel better to say you're ""protecting"" *YOUR* kids, who are in middle school and plenty aware that bad things happen in this world.


Her ""criminal history"" is shoplifting - which is completely expected from a teen in foster care with early childhood trauma, poverty, and apparent attachment issues that were maybe casued by, idk, her parents dumping her off on strangers. She is also by your own report, working to do well for herself now.


She was your kid too and you abandoned her. You are literally worse than any of the Disney ""evil stepmothers"". 


She absolutely has a right to that money. And her statement ""not that you'd care"" sounds absolutely spot on."

"&gt; My selfish side wants to tell him since like you say it's possible (however unlikely) that it might blow up in my face but I can't think of causing him so much pain when no good outcome can come out of it.

It's not selfish to tell your husband the truth, no matter how painful. You also need to understand that if your husband feels pain from this, it won't be because of you. You're not the one to have caused him that pain. But you can be there to help him through it, like any good partner would. Hiding things from your husband on the other hand, especially something of this magnitude, **is** selfish. From the cases we've seen here, it's almost certain that this secret will eventually come out. When your husband finds out you've kept this from him, **that** would be causing him direct pain. **That** would make him lose trust in you. Do you want to shake the foundations of your marriage? Over something that wasn't in your control?

"&gt;We do our laundry together and live in the same apartment/room. 

Do you have your own washer dryer, or do you use a building unit shared by multiple people?

&gt;I have never had any suspicions other than the mysterious panties

I've dealt with cheating and it seems to be commonly agreed that a big red flag is that they are absent without explanation; they are hyper protective of their devices/email, etc. 

Without snooping, is there a way to piece together his timelines? 

My SO and I lived in a Condo that had hook-ups for washer/dryer, but we didn't own one at the time. We did laundry and would often find that there were errant panties: ladybug boy shorts that are certainly not mine or my SOs. But, we were doing laundry on a routine schedule that synced-up with someone else in our building. The front loading washers had a gap where panties/socks could slip and not be seen. They'd wind-up in our load of laundry and then we'd wind-up with a pair that weren't ours. 

I'm not saying that is happening, or is your case:

Something is up; but, it certainly might not be cheating. It could certainly be just a case of some panties being mixed-up and you're finding them as time goes on; it could be that he has a panty fetish and somehow acquires them; it could be a pair that someone left at your place and is just a random coincidence that it happened twice. And yes, it could be cheating. 

You're going to need to dig more before you can conclusively prove that he's a lech. With what you have, there just isn't any conclusive proof. "
"&gt; stay away from this dumb broad.

"&gt; We would love to have a child to spoil, and genuinely love Joey, I want to give him everything, I want him to know we love him. I want to give him the things that a parent might not consider worth it, but a loving Aunt and Uncle would! 

I know your intentions are good, but I can't help but wonder if Joey's parents are uncomfortable with the way you're directing your desire to have a child in your lives at him: either because they feel the need to reinforce that *they're* his parents and they get to determine how much spoiling is too much, or because they suspect things will change whenever you do have a child of your own and they don't want him getting used to this.

As others have said, you're best off either giving Joey the gift of time with you (which is probably what he'll appreciate most; I couldn't tell you what gifts my favorite aunt and uncle got me as a child, but I remember how excited their yearly visits made me) or setting aside savings for his future.  But if you want to see your generosity rewarded in the short term, you might consider turning some of that goodwill toward Big Brothers/Big Sisters or another volunteer organization that works with kids who would be thrilled just to get gifts."

"I'll give some perspective my dude

my mom resents me. She has since I was conceived. She was talked out of an abortion that, in all honesty, she should have had. I almost killed her.


I knew this early, early on. Even before she said anything, I could tell. I hated her for that, and as I grew older, the hate had begun to shrink, because I could see where she was coming from, and understand what happened. I do, however, wish she would have either had the abortion and prevented me from legitimately almost killing her while I was gestating, or gave me up to someone who wanted me and could care for me.


Kids aren't stupid, and they will hate you no matter what you do if you don't want them. I feel as though it's kinder to put a kid in a place where they won't know about their parent's resentment for a good long while, and more easily forgivable/excusable."
"Okay let me get this straight. Your sister in law was having trouble conceiving to which your wife and her sister decide that YOUR wife should be a surrogate so her sister can have her child. WOW. 

The kicker? Your wife decided to test the waters by asking you if you would be okay with the situation and once you  told her hell no; for obvious reasons. She decides to get pregnant without consulting you. Reading throughout the comments everyone is pissed that OP isn't taking care of his pregnant wife. However, I believe this situation doesn't come down to him being lazy and not taking care of his pregnant wife. It comes down to OP's wife not respecting his opinion in the matter and proceeding with her own plans. You're married and should work as a team. You wife decided to do what she wants breaking your trust. This is TOTALLY divorce worthy. You didn't sign up for this and should totally feel disrespected.

I believe the solution is to ride out her pregnancy and proceed with the divorce proceedings and serve her the papers after she's given birth. My reasoning? The proceedings will take a while so get everything in order and get ready to bounce. Also, why the hell do you have to help her with her pregnancy  when she decided to act on her own. Whenever she feels like she needs a midnight snack, call sister in law and have her deal with it.

All in all, she disrespected your marriage and your opinion. You stay with her what's to say she won't make other important life decisions without you. 

Actions have consequences."
"I've been in a vaguely similar situation as this. One thing to understand is that guys (especially at your age) have this tendency to call ""dibs"" on a girl. Understand that the girl has the choice, and she chose you. Just because your friend likes her, does not mean he owns her. She's never never ever going to like some creep who hasn't gotten the hint after 7 years, and actively tries to sabotage her relationships. No way, your buddy has to get over it, and in a backwards way you may be helping. 


You don't need these kinds of friends in your life. I have had to start over making new friends several times. This is going to happen to you during certain points like moving, graduating, falling-out etc. This is a part of growing up, and changing. Usually, it will take a few weeks to a few months for you to find new friends. Understand that there are better friends out there and its just going to take time to meet them, your social life isn't over, it just going to slow for a while. And seriously, in the future watch out for the ""dibs"" behavior, these are not the type of guys you want hanging around the next time you are looking for a girl to date/etc. "

"&gt; My white boyfriend didn't need to be as angry as I was, but he also didn't discount my feelings or minimize the problem.

This is the secret to making things work. I feel very very lucky to have a partner who is also switched on and engaged and passionate about ""social justice"" issues, but he wouldn't have to be for the relationship to continue. The most important things are empathy and respect! Undermining your emotional response to things (particularly that hit close to home for you as a WOC) is really shitty, and - to me - a dealbreaker.

PS. I can see you're getting some flack for sending ""clickbait shit"" (as if the only articles about minority/political issues are by default clickbait pfft). As someone who is also passionate about womn's issues, politics, intersectionality, etc. I don't think it's unreasonable to send articles about issues that you're passionate about to your spouse! But his response is showing that he's not the right spouse for you. It's super important to me to be able to show my partner things that I care about and have him respond in a way that doesn't make me feel minimised and ignored. Sometimes I send my partner 10 serious articles in a row about depressing shit - we still have a jokey, lively relationship. I don't think your social media practices are shitty at all, and I hope you find a partner that has more similar values to you in the future. "

I know there's the horrible lazy stigma for those who are disabled and use chairs but idk... those seem like pretty reasonable things as long as she asks politely and isn't of course dropping things on purpose. She might want attention too and doesn't know how to get it any other way, being disabled in a workplace full of able-bodied people has to feel isolating at times.

Cussing her out was wrong, which I'm sure you already know, and will only give her reason to complain about you too. Next time maybe address her ""move, move!"" comments with the management and say that she is disruptive and rude, or make a comment to her yourself asking her to please ask nicely or say 'excuse me' when she's coming through. 

If you feel like she doesn't do her work tell your manager. If he thinks she's doing her work adequately then there's nothing you can do unfortunately. "
"I wouldn't be surprised if some of the sadness is your own version of empty nest syndrome.  You took guardianship of a 6 year old when you were 22, and did an amazing job of putting her first.  That involved an awful lot of selfless sacrifice I'm sure, and I think it might be hard to start thinking of yourself again more, and what you want out of your life.  As much as it was a huge change taking her in back then, it will also be a huge change to have her grow up and no longer need you in the same way.  

It's possible too that there might be some level of grief that you couldn't really process fully before, when you had to put her first."

"Ok, five years is a long time, especially if you live together and these comments may be hard to stomach. 

I'm your age right now. I've been in a relationship with someone quite a bit older than me and he cheated on me too. I begged and pleaded with him to stop and he didn't want to. When I tried to split up, he got mad that I would accuse him of it (never admitted he did even though I had obvious evidence) and violent when I tried to leave. I don't want to see you hurt because he thinks he's groomed you.

He is cheating. Period. It is not acceptable for him to be spending drunk nights with another women without talking to you. His phone didn't die, he isn't going to end up walking around because he's with her. And he's groomed you to think this is ok. You aren't naïve, you are being manipulated. The fact that you came here to ask that shows that you KNOW something is wrong with this.

I know this hurts, I know this sucks, but you are 22. You've spent your entire adult life with someone who will blow a 5 year relationship for another girl.

So get your valuable stuff together (passport, SS card, license, split your bank account if you have a joint) and get ready to leave.

Good luck. &lt;3"

Did she have children, and were you jealous that they got to live with their/you biological mother and you didn't? Was it weird to think of yourself as the offspring of your father and your mother's sister?"
"&gt; I just wish there were an easy way to not hurt her feelings and possibly cause a blowout. I'm a very logical thinker and I tend to think that explaining my reasons should be enough, but it isn't.

Breaking down these phrases and countering them:

You are not responsible for her feelings or happiness.  It's *nice* when we can do something nice for the other person.  However, it's 100% OKAY to say NO.  Imagine you were a diabetic and she kept trying to force feed you cake all the time.  It""s okay to say No and stick to your guns.

Hurt feelings are a part of life.  No one gets their way all the time, including your MIL.  We are all grown ups who have to learn to deal with rejection of our ideas and wants.  We don't always get what we want from others.  You cannot give her what she wants.  She will have to get used to it.  You aren't being rude about it, so don't feel bad about it.

If her hurt feelings cause a blowout, that is on her.  You are standing up for your own personal life choices and decisions.  A blowout because she can't accept that?  How is that okay?  It's not okay, but it's not a blowout driven by your choice to stand up for yourself but rather by her choice or inability to accept No for an answer.  That's on her.

She is not a court judge or lawyer.  She doesn't have to be a logical thinker if she doesn't want to be.  Unfortunately, she's completely in her rights to be driven by emotional and religious rationale.  There's not much you can do there, unless you want to burst into tears the next time you say NO, please stop asking me (not recommended).

You don't need to her to agree or approve of your decision.  You do need her to respect your decision, and her steamrolling is her disrespect, which is why it feels so exhausting to deal with her.  Remember all these things when you shut down her steamrolling.

"Ignore her. It sounds like you're dressing fine and she literally is just jealous. 

If she says something to you again, go to HR."
"From what I understand about being trans, it's a huge transition made to help you accept who you are. Why are you willing to throw that all away for someone who only accepts 50% of you?"
"&gt; Okay, that kind of behavior is not lovable ~~unless~~ **even if** you are the kid in question's parent. 

FTFY"
"Also the bizarre subsequent behavior makes it highly unlikely it's just an ""Ooops, I forgot"" "
Her getting upset is just her way of trying to deflect responsibility for her own shitty lack of responsibility.
16 year olds are not adults. Stop sexualising teenagers.
"I did a divorce where the guy hadn't seen his kid in about 10 months (by choice - he refused to see the child). The wife filed for divorce? He immediately tried to get a passport for the child. We caught him trying to arrange for his mother in his home country to raise the kid. 

People do mad, spiteful shit in divorces. "
"Are you an idiot? 

Let me get this together:

1. You've cheated on her.

2. She has trust issues. She finds it hard to believe that you want to be with her.

3. You say her how you would love to fuck other people an don't find her appealing anymore.

4. Reddit now should help you clean up this gigantic fucked up mess.

Please leave this girl alone and let her be happy with someone who is a somewhat decent person. Bonus for you is, you can fuck around as much as you like."
"Seriously, my goodness. There is so much assumption here with OP I'm afraid even if they were miscarriages OP might not even believe her. He seems really convinced she's been hiding abortions from him. "
It annoys me so much when people don't even bother reading the whole story and then decide that their opinion is still important. You don't have a clue what you're talking about.
"Congrats, you're dating a woman."
"&gt;Was the only point of our relationships for her to convert me and move onto the next person? 

Sure looks that way..."
Thats even more of a leap than OP is making. Sheesh!
"This is who he really is. The ""fun-loving sweetheart"" was his representative. If you don't know this already, the first six months to a year of dating are the ""honeymoon period"" when your partner is still being really careful to present themselves in the best possible light. When that ends, whoever is left is the actual person you're dating. So unless you want to stay with a pedantic jerk who won't help you around the house and tries to make your dog sick, I would suggest dumping him and getting a better boyfriend. You're only 23. don't throw more time at this."
"Do not spend any time alone with her or talk to her, her family has already accused you of creeping and she may take that to another level. Distance yourself as everyone else mentions. "
"7000 of anything is an obsession. Theres some psychological component that you are missing, sexual or not. 

Almost all of us have had relationships that are hard to define. I knew of two twin brothers that slept in tbe same bed up-to and including 22 years old. It was completely odd.

The reality of the situation is her mental health. If she was IN LOVE with this person, maybe she moved on to you, and the step sister was the last person she was emotionally close to, and now you are the new person she is obsessing over. I bet she has many photos of you sleeping that you dont know about.

Ugh is her accepting the fact her emotional relationship is fractured because one or both are straight and have grown up. The sis is married, and your girl is with you."

"I think this could all easily stem from a lot of stress, as others have indicated. OP's husband is the sole financial provider, doing most of the chores, and all of the cooking. Someone suggests that he should have budgeted before all of this started, and while they should have, it doesn't necessarily mean that they did, or did it well. The screaming, as I read it, doesn't sound like its a common occurrence, and currently OP's husband is under excessive amounts of stress, which means he could have just flown off the handle. I don't think the best idea is to compound the issues by removing his clothes and hiding them. Sure, it drives the point home, but it may cause more arguments and issues. The better suggestion in my opinion would be to show the husband what does and does not fit."
"Call it déformation professionnelle. I'm too primed to think like and negotiate with people who are rational or at the very least act according to realpolitik principles. It obviously doesn't work with her or in this circumstance.

So I was hoping someone to come up with something. Wishful thinking."
"You aren't a bad person if you can't go along with him on this change. Just as he gets to have his identity and preferences, so do you, and it sounds like you just aren't attracted to or romantically inclined towards women or womanly men. That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person. 

He deserves support, but that doesn't mean you have to be his primary supporter. If this change is too painful for you, that's okay. "

"T-shirts are good, everyday lounging clothes.  Going to do yard work?  T-shirt.  Going to stay in and just read/hang out?  T-shirt.

And, yes, a lot of people, women included, do have t-shirts that are very special to them.  Shirts bought during happy memories, or great gifts.  A friend of mine has a t-shirt from every single PAX, and he'll never get rid of them.  Things like that.  They can be special."
"Why the fuck did your friend invite your ex?

At that moment you should have declined the invitation. That's just rude and inconsiderate of her.

""Hey OP, I invited your ex to my party""

""Cool, I hope you have fun! I won't be coming anymore though"""
"Oh my god I'm sorry.

"I know a family that kept having kids because they wanted a son after 4 daughters they finally got a son. The son is severely autistic (he cant go to the bathroom by himself and has a limited vocabulary pretty much he cant be on his own) he is 13 or 14 now and his sisters took turns taking care of him until the youngest girl finally moved away because she didn't want to be the permanent caretaker. 

The parents really wanted a son but once they found out he would be a hassle to raise they dumped him on his sisters. As a result they never had much of a childhood everything about them revolved on the son because the parents are never home. now that the parents have to take care of him he has gained a lot of weight because they just feed him fast-food."
"I'll give you a different idea.  You are much older and hopefully much wiser and more mature.  Try inviting her to lunch - your treat - bring your gift instead of sending it with your mother.  Apologize for all the miscommunication (whether you mean it or not) and ask he all about the wedding plans and let her talk about herself and her big day.  Listen.  It would be a good attempt at fixing the rift and getting to know her better.  She's going to be your brother's wife, so do it because you love him.  I'd try to have a better relationship with her."

2. TELL HER WHY you broke up with her. If you're going to get back together, she deserves to know what she is getting into. Not telling her would just be playing with her emotions again.

3. Beg for her back.

"Yeah...I noticed the OP glossed over a bunch of stuff here. Before this issue she was friends with this person and now all of a sudden things are going sour.

Sounds like OP and family were staying (possibly squatting) in a house that belonged to someone who passed away, and now is trying to take advantage of the situation. No mention of a lease, no mention of how much they pay per month and if they're on time or behind, nothing.

Sounds like a family member that is tired of someone taking advantage of them and wants them gone."
Fuck that. You make it sound like she's less of a woman for being infertile and should be happy that anyone wants to be with her. Disgusting.

"Wow, there was so much angst in this post, I don't know where to begin.

Alright, from what you've described, your sister was pretty shitty. You have every right to make the choice to remove her from your life. No one is arguing that.

Here's the deal, though: just as you have a hard boundary on no contact or anything regarding your sister, your family has the same right to do so towards you, too. At the end of the day, the reasons don't really matter. People will accept or reject what ever they want, as you have seen with the dismissal of your feelings. 

If keeping your sister out of your life for good is an absolute, non-negotiable boundary for you, then you have to accept that your decision may be an absolute, non-negotiable boundary for your family. That's it. No ifs ands or buts about it.

That said, your behavior isn't helping your cause. Your angry outbursts are eerily similar to tantrums and the venom dripping in your post is palpable. But what purpose is it serving you, truly? Emotional responses are a good indication that there is something that needs our attention. Your anger got you away from your sister. You already have effective methods of avoiding contact in daily life. Your family gets involved, however, and your anger is still directed at her. She's responsible for her actions, sure, but your family is responsible for their actions. Doesn't matter who pressured whom, doesn't matter if it was a coercive thing by sis; they still chose the actions they made.

Your family may never stop trying to get you to reconcile with your sister. Never. Can you live with that? Do you want to continue to bend your life around your sister? 

There are no right or wrong answers. Only what's right and wrong for you. Only you can decide what is the correct path for you, and take it. All actions have consequences, and if you are prepared to take those consequences, then you'll be set. If not, you'll need to soul-search to evaluate why."
"Read your TL;DR again. Is there a single time you mention your wife's feelings, or your mistress's, or your child's?

More 'me'! Stop thinking about your goddamn self. Your wife has a right to know. This is something she needs to know so that she can make her own choices. This isn't a one night kiss, this is a multi-month affair with a child who you are paying for out of family assets. Are you technically stealing her money in addition to lying to her? If people hate you, that's really rough for you, but *you did something terrible enough to deserve it*. Be an adult. Own up to your mistakes. Don't let your poor wife find out from anyone but you. Accept the consequences of your thought out actions. Keep doing right by your child. And stop being so selfish. It's what got you into this mess. "
"If you feel it will upset you more then don't do it. 

But you don't necessarily have to ask her to come. You can just send a text saying your peace. Something like:

"I bet your husband is dismissing your opinion partly because he thinks that your view is based solely on emotion and that as the more experienced parent he ""knows better"" than you. So may I suggest you get scientific research on your side and show your husband some data to back up your argument. 

Recent scientific studies have shown that spanking actually is harmful to children.  We can't link outside sources in this sub so here is a excerpt from a relatively recent article that summarizes the latest study:

&gt; In the Journal of Family Psychology, Dr. Elizabeth Gershoff of The University of Texas at Austin brings together studies of the effects of spanking that included a total of 160,927 children. ""Our analysis focuses on what most Americans would recognize as spanking and not on potentially abusive behaviors,"" Gershoff said in a statement. Spanking was defined as an open-handed slap to the buttocks or limbs.

&gt; Gershoff concluded that there is an association between spanking and 13 of the 17 detrimental outcomes they tested for. Most strikingly, she found that it is a very ineffective way to get children to follow parents' wishes.

&gt; ""We found that spanking was associated with unintended detrimental outcomes and was not associated with more immediate or long-term compliance, which are parents' intended outcomes when they discipline their children,"" Gershoff said.

&gt; On top of this, the traditional line that “it never did me any harm” doesn't stand up very well. Adults who were spanked as a child were more likely to suffer mental health problems and to behave in anti-social ways.

&gt; A UNICEF report found that in most countries, more than 70 percent of children were spanked in the previous month, so it is obviously not the case that spanking is always disastrous (unless you take a very grim view of the state of humanity). However, the evidence Gershoff compiled suggests that the frequency of spanking is as important as whether it happens at all. The more often a child was spanked, the more likely they were to show negative effects.

&gt; The aspect of Gershoff's study that is likely to draw the most disbelief is her comparison with physical abuse. ""We as a society think of spanking and physical abuse as distinct behaviors,"" she said. ""Yet our research shows that spanking is linked with the same negative child outcomes as abuse, just to a slightly lesser degree.""

&gt; Despite the fact that the studies Gershoff used go back as far as the 1960s, the comparison of spanking to abuse always draws a backlash, even though some psychologists argue they are actually the same thing. 

You can start by searching online for the latest article in Scientific American on this topic: ""What Science Says—and Doesn't—about Spanking"" and go from there.  Once you have a few sources ready you might be able to approach this topic with him with a bit of an upper hand."

Additionally, she is making it sound as though you only need her for sex:

&gt; She says that because I masturbate, that means that I don't need her anymore

Does she believe she's only a means to sexual release? Does she think that's all she offers in the relationship?

Telling you that you are not allowed to do anything without her (aside from cheating or betraying her trust) is controlling. Making you feel guilty and doubt your right to do those things is manipulative.

You are not in the wrong. If masturbation is a deal breaker for her, you have to decide if that's really something you are willing to give up in order to make her happy. Since you smoking weed and drinking without her is also a deal breaker, you have to decide how you feel about never doing those things with friends or future coworkers unless she is by your side.

If you're not okay with it, talk to her and tell her how you feel. If she cries and tells you how much you're hurting her, that is manipulation again. And if she can't compromise, then the only way to make her happy is to give in until she finds something else she doesn't want you to do.

That is coming from experience dating someone who also didn't want me to masturbate or drink without him. It will not end if you give in. Compromise is never enough for them."

You cannot force parenthood on a man any more than you can force an abortion on a woman. If he doesn't want to be a parent, then he wont be. you need to decide if you want to be a single mom.  

It's up to you with what you'd want. I'm guessing adoption is the best method for you. Put the child up for adoption and start saving in case the state goes after you for CS.  

If you want to be a single parent, great. Just see a lawyer and start the CS process. Because this will be international CS, the process can be difficult.

"Wtf? He has no legitimate outlet? You know what kids do when they don't have a gf/ bf? They MASTURBATE. Not let animals lick stuff off of their genitals. He's 16, not 6 for heavens sake. Plenty of 16 year olds don't have sexual partners. Doesn't mean they molest their animals. I don't agree that the parents need to know, but don't fucking defend his gross behavior. "
"That's what's really surprising. By that age I was really branching out as an independent adult and exploring the world around me. I was spending a lot more time with other people, going to events, and trying new things.

"Omg. That statement about not having custody because he had a newborn and girlfriend hurt me.

Did you every think that you doing that hurt Trudy? Do you not realize that a young girl, when her parents divorced and her father had a baby with another woman, and she didn't see her father for six years would hold on to resentment and anger?

I get it. You don't want to be a check to her. But damn. Do you love her? Yes, she chose a non lucrative career but why are you comparing that to Amy?

"None of these things will get better when you live together! I live with my boyfriend, and just last night we were talking about how living together exacerbates any issues you may have before you move in together. Fortunately, we waited and we developed good communication and strategies for dealing with each other prior to moving in. If we had tried before we were ready it would have been a disaster. 

You don't ""owe"" her anything. Frankly, after four years, if you still have all these issues and maybe it's time to move on rather than move in."
Yes. You are being bratty. 
"Seconding this. It doesn't seem so much like an ""arranged marriage"" so much as it seems to be ""my family expects me to get married.. let me use OP to get ahead with my side boyfriend.""

"Every time Carol runs someone over, the person should call an ambulance and go to the ER to get checked out, and then file a workers compensation claim since the injury happened at work.

Fun fact: employers pay money for workers compensation coverage and their rates go up each time they have a claim, just like your car insurance. And, honestly, power chairs are heavy and could injure someone - the behavior OP described is legitimately dangerous. "

you're going to do what you want to do, which is fine, it's your life.  but at the very least, wait a couple years to get to know him and go to lots of counseling before marrying him."
"OK, chronic pain is no joke.  I believe some people either feel pain more extremely or are very poorly equipped to handle pain.  Personally, I have had physicians tell me I have a pretty high pain tolerance, I hardly ever finish an RX for pain pills after a procedure, etc.  Yeah , it hurts, but I can cope and it doesn't wreck my life or anything.  

I truly think some people feel it more, or can't deal with it, and that might be your mom.  If it is... or isn't... I don't know that there is anything you can do about it.  

I'd recommend you talk to a therapist about *your* feelings and how your mom's chronic issues impacted *your* childhood and current life.  And if you get to a good place with therapy, maybe encourage your mom as well?  

My mother also suffers from chronic pain (as a result of an injury 20 years ago) and I try to be patient with her, but also, I will only listen to 5 minutes of complaining at a time, then I change the subject.  If she changes it back, I get off the phone.  Yes, I do feel conflicted about this approach, like you do, am I being an asshole?  But if I didn't it would be all she'd talk about, all the time, forever.  Because she has chronic pain.  It literally always hurts.  FWIW, my mom refuses to do talk therapy or CBT.  She's had multiple surgeries.  I don't doubt that she IS in pain, real pain.  But I can't let it take over our relationship.  And she has learned that I won't let her vent to me for hours about it.   I might get hate for this approach but it works for me.  

Your mom might be in real pain from injury.  She might have conversion disorder, which guess what?  FEELS REAL to the patient.  She might have munchausen's and be inventing the pain, not really feeling it at all. Who can say?  In any case, whether she feels it or not, whether it is the result of injury or not, it doesn't mean this isn't an issue.  Something is going on.  "

One question,  why not offer her a settlement?  You seem adamant that she didn't deserve half but you have been with this women a long time.  What do you think she deserves after a decade of being married to her?  
I'm not asking about legalities here but on a personal level you have loved this women and admit that you still like her as a person.  "
"that's not a fair attitude to have when both of you have full time jobs; he needs to understand you're doing a little extra work in your belly and perhaps reassign him a couple of your household responsibilities until the baby has come 

to be honest, after the baby has come you'll have to reevaluate both of your household responsibilities again since now you have a child to take care of

whenever a life changing event occurs I'd suggest all responsibilities should be reviewed again for fairness "
"I agree with this comment. I was about to say something similar. I had this same sort of conversation with my boyfriend about an ex-girlfriend he wanted to remain friends with. Also, I have a problem with a someone claiming someone else is ""over reacting"" and also getting back at them by excluding them... Honestly, I would break up with him if he can't empathize with your side and change his behavior/choices."
It's still scary to hear though. I'm not even sure if the cops would take me seriously because he has an uncle and a cousin on the police force but it's worth a shot 
"Yeah, honestly, that's what I was thinking. Had he actually been convicted, I would agree with the decision to leave, but in the meantime all he was doing was not bending to prosecutor strong-arm tactics. Whether or not a prosecutor/police officer has enough information to convict, they are likely to bluff their asses off because if they can convince someone to plead, they don't need the evidence. Or, in OP's bf's case, if they can intimidate him into giving information, then they might get enough evidence to get a conviction that they wouldn't necessarily otherwise get.

What's done is done, but I think OP was too quick to follow this sub's all or nothing advice."
"I think this is a response to reddit's habit of immediately suggesting breaking up over any issue, trivial or not, rather than an assertion that he has to stay with her. When people come here to share their problems, they don't tend to go on a full history lesson about all the things that make their relationship loving, satisfying and worth fighting for, so people have fewer qualms with jumping straight to the extreme option. "
"As awful as it is I was thinking this may be it, especially if he didn't want to have sex while OP was pregnant. A conversation needs to be had for sure. "
"To be fair, as much as it sucks that your dad started drinking again, **it doesn't seem particularly likely that him re-starting drinking had any direct link to the cancer that ultimately took your father's life, and I suspect you may be unfairly attributing his death to your brother's actions**- maybe because then there's someone to point a finger at for what happened?

...And if I had to guess, I'd assume that sure, your brother being in jail likely contributed to your mother's unhappiness in life, but it seems even more likely that the death of her husband (from cancer that your brother didn't cause) plus both her children being 'adult' enough to live on their own was far more of a trigger for her deciding to end her life."
"My dad was like this. He had a cough for a year before he saw a doctor. Turns out he had stage 4 lymphoma. He's now in remission and refuses to go to the doctor for follow-up appointments (because money, time, etc). My mom begged him to go in the beginning and has just now given up. She told him if he wants his cancer to come back that badly, she won't stand in his way.

The point I'm trying to make is that you can't change your bf. Even if something major happens, he might still not change his mind. You need to decide if you're willing to live with this for the rest of your life. "

"I did it. My husband has over $400,000 in student loan debt. 

However, I have a good career and he is in his first year in an anesthesiology residency, so I'm not that worried. I met him before med school, and made a commitment to stand by him. We have a plan together to address his debt, and I understood this going in. 

However, OP's situation is pretty different. If I had been blindsided by this and his salary was that low, I'd feel a lot like his girlfriend does. "
"Seriously. This^

OP you are essentially punishing her for something she did NOT do wrong. Cut that shit out or cut the girlfriend out."
"&gt;she feels guilty not staying home.

It's probably that guilt that is fuelling her resentment towards the nanny. You said your son is a newborn; it could even be post-natal depression that is feeding into her guilt. It will take both of you a while to adjust to juggling family and work life.

If your wife continues to struggle with guilt, she should probably see a counsellor. In the meantime, sit down with the babysitter and outline some clear boundaries, particularly in regards to your spaces.

To me it just sounds like she's trying to show initiative and a good work ethic. You wouldn't want to lose someone who is a good worker and takes excellent care of your son if you can help it."

Dom also see's how good the two of you are together, and it makes him resent that he is dating a turd sandwich while his overweight and in his eyes, less of a catch, friend has a great girlfriend.

Jackie probably recognizes this, which is why she only wants you looking like a slob around her boyfriend and why she wants to know what you and Dom talk about.

Basically, they both are miserable cunts...who instead of going their separate ways, are trying to make everyone else as miserable as them...because happy people remind them that they are miserable cunts

"This needs to be higher. Everyone is bashing the wife but honestly if she came on here and told us a story of a husband that was really close to this female friend, like WAYYYYY too close and then she found out he had been keeping from her that they had been fwb before they were in a relationship we would be on her side. She would tell us she would be thinking about abortion for now while they work on the marriage and most of the people would be telling her it is 'the best option' and 'why bring a baby into this mess if it might end in divorce'.

"Perhaps if you tell her what actually happened to you and how your own hopes of a different life were dashed, that might make it more real to her. I know you're probably trying to spare her the sad details and protect her from the pain, but it sounds like she just doesn't truly understand what might have been and is still clinging to her old life and dreams. 

I'd even recommend telling her how you felt about the marriage before it happened, how you hoped against hope that it would be better than your parents' relationship, and then just how bad it was in reality and the pain it caused you. How your parents didn't help you even though it was so bad. (I'm adlibbing here off of what you said, sorry if this is totally off base!) 

She's 19- as difficult as it may be to tell her what you went through, it may save her from a similar experience or going back to your parents. I have my own experience of telling my younger siblings about deeply painful and messed up experiences: it's really hard, and you want to protect them, but they're strong than you think and will be the better for knowing."
"Think of a woman, say in her 40s, who's newly single, and she sees all the single men in her age bracket ignoring her to go after 20-somethings. Would it be RIGHT of her to feel a sharp pang of resentment for the 20-somethings raiding her relatively small dating pool when they have all the young guys at their disposal, too? No, but that doesn't mean it's not kind of understandable.

Raj is young and not handling his emotions properly. He's not being introspective or mature about what he's feeling. But that doesn't mean his feelings aren't legitimate. Unfortunately, and this is where intersectionality comes in, there's real racism at play that makes him feel devalued as an Indian man, and seeing his white roommate hooking up with a pretty indian girl is triggering that, rightly or wrongly."
"Agreed. We don't have a lot of clues to go on, but that comment about the rings had me pause. He might have already started planning something after these talks, and if OP does it first he might be disappointed that his plans were thwarted.

1000% YES!! Completely agree. This guy sounds Loony Tunes. 
"Everyone commenting on your junk to your wife is an asshole.

OP, you acted within your rights at the time, but you are being very insensitive of your wife's feelings. Would you really not care if everyone had access to pictures/video of your wife naked? You may think it shouldn't be a big deal because it was within an educational context, but to your wife it may feel violating that everyone else knows what your naked body looks like. You had a level of intimacy stripped away, at least from her perspective, which is why she feels like you ""cheated."" Plus, she is obviously uncomfortable that people are commenting on your body to her, that's a really awkward position to be in.

Just because you don't feel awkward doesn't mean that she can't. You should tell her that you're sorry you didn't tell her about this sooner. You don't have to be sorry you made the video, but you could be a lot more sensitive to your wife's position and ask her if there is anything you can do to make this easier for her. "

I get that you're angry. But I am only trying to help you understand what he is going through.

You getting empathy from your family and your brother getting empathy don't have to be mutually exclusive."
"Thank you for your comment. Through this, and others, I'm starting to realize I've put a lot of blame on my sister-and-law, and that may not be fair. He has been a part of every decision (keeping the doomed baby to term, letting his wife go on like this). It's as much his fault as hers. Probably more, as he's technically not ""depressed"".

I'm still not sure how to approach this because he's made it clear he thinks the status quo is fine, but it's something to think on."
I would definitely not want to be with a girl my brother has had sex with. Or any family member to be honest. It just feels weird and wrong. I know it's not incest but to me it's just something you don't do. I don't date my brother's exes and he won't date mine.
Maybe he should have thought of that before trying to make himself a single parent.
"Er no. Insulting someone is not grown up language, it's a childish temper tantrum.  Dump his ass now.  If my husband ever seriously called me that, he'd be out the door and nursing his balls.

"I think you are in the right for now, but your anger at Sara is fairly petty. What did you expect and why isn't she part of the ""our immediate family""? How far do you plan to carry this idea that she isn't part of you and your husband's family? Will the two of you visit your kids together in future years when they've moved away but not Sara? Will her kids not be considered ""our grandkids"" in contrast to the kids your children have? So, you don't have to pay for her college given these circumstances, but excluding her from the circle of who is considered family to you two has the potential to harm your relationship with your husband and/or his relationship with his daughter."
"&gt; Neither of us are happy about our looks as we've aged and we have definitely talked about that.

Maybe you guys can work on this together, as a bonding experience? I don't think you're wrong in your assessment of this girl, but I do think that your worry is founded from insecurity, and that you will continue to get more and more paranoid if you don't address the root cause (the insecurity). That will lead to more violations of his privacy, and possibly a slow descent into actually becoming the overbearing jealous girlfriend.

Your boyfriend seems like he is doing ok at drawing boundaries. IMO, he shouldn't be texting this girl at all (there isn't really any reason I see for her to be talking to her outside of work, since they're not really the same age, they don't hang out much, and they don't have mutual friends or interests), but at least he's continuously turning her down for hangout times. 

I think the important thing for you both here is to address your mutual fear of aging. Don't like your looks? Go to the gym together! Eat healthier! Learn more about dressing well! Worried about aging? Go together to couples therapy to talk it out! Or individual therapy! Turn your concerns into investments in your relationship."

"My cousin did this three times.  The first whoops daddy dumped her and has nothing to do with his (really great) son.  The second whoops daddy married her.  He said he did want any more kids until they were financially stable, she said ok but threw a fit, then whoops there's baby #3.  I have no doubt all 3 were on purpose. He felt so violated and mistrustful after that, it wasn't long before they were divorced.

She was perfectly fine with leaning on you for support when she thought you had zero doubts in the relationship.  But when it turned out you did, it made her re-evaluate everything.

So basically, she didn't reject your proposal out right.  She realized your proposal was something you felt obligated to do, not something you wanted to do. 

*I thought that may giving her this very solid commitment, it would ease her fears. Now I just don't know.*

And there you have it.  You didn't propose because you love her and couldn't deal with the thought of living a day without her in your life...you proposed because you thought it's what she wanted.

And while the tadpole finds that unfair some times, and complains to me when we skype, I simply tell her that the rules are different because her dad, her dad's girlfriend, and I are different people. But she still have to adhere to what she's told. 

Ex's girlfriend is great though. We're wildly different people, but she's a lovely woman and I trust her to do what's best for my daughter, because I trust my ex to give her the authority to make rules and enforce boundaries. I also ""gave her permission"", so to speak, to remove any hesitation based on what she might worry I would think/say/feel about it.

I'm my daughter's mother, and a step-mother won't change that. Instead a step-mother who is afraid to step in and be an authoritative and safe person would hurt the wee one more, and ultimately can also make my job as a parent harder."
"To add onto this, my mom worked 80 hours weeks while pregnant with me until about 6 months in my dad got upset with her and asked, ""Do you realize that's my baby too?""

I can imagine he actually wants to share the experience of her pregnancy and raising children together, not just divvy up the burden. And frankly, 16 hour workdays aren't really conducive to having small children regardless of gender. "
"First... you're going to go to your FB and delete every picture of you with other girls.  Then you're going to go purge your ""friends"" list of anyone that you don't actually talk to. If you wouldn't go help them move a piano they don't need to be your FB friend. Finally change your FB to just be a simple picture of yourself or one of you and your wife.  Maybe the ultrasound picture.  For a lot of people your FB profile is a reflection of yourself... who are you now?  Are you the punk rocker military guy that hangs out with chicks all the time or are you a married family man that's about to have a baby?

After you've fixed that issue and reflected you need to call your wife and apologize. Explain to her that you felt a sense of loyalty to your old friends and were struggling to deal with letting go of your old life for your new much better life. Explain to her that you now see how shitty you've been to her while trying to keep up your punk persona. Then assure her that you are done with that life.  You choose her and it won't happen again.  You're not only ready and willing but excited to go on this new journey with her.  Keep in mind this isn't anything all that special that you are going through... marriage and children changes people. A lot of hard core gamers drop their games when they get married and have children and it can be hard for them too.  Suddenly the friends that they would play with and talk endlessly about games with don't have as much to talk about. Instead of all night gaming marathons they are having dinner parties or playing with stacking blocks... If the friends can't understand that then they aren't the best of friends. 

Hopefully, after you've called your wife she will come home and you can move past this. 

Good luck!"

"Solid post, great advice. Just one thing:

&gt;unless that person is currently dying in a hospital

don't tell them that, or she might claim she is. "
"&gt; many parents would be uncomfortable having someone who shouts profanities and insults around their own children.

Well, some parents would be uncomfortable having a person in a wheelchair around their children.
Children need to learn that some people are different. You can't hide them from the real world forever."
"Yeah, but if your current girlfriend found evidence of that you'd say ""Funny story.   This cheating ex- of mine blah blah blah"""
Bring up counseling again and he'll do the heavy lifting of breaking up with you. 
"That's how I got my new baby brother at 31. Dad loved perving and as I hit adulthood he found a woman with teen daughters and groomed the youngest. 

Aw young love. 

This is not okay. 

You're going to see a lot of justifications here but it isn't okay. "
Please get your dog a new home away from this awful person you married. WTF. Is he going to flip out over accidents when your future kid wets the bed too?
"He's putting her inconvenience above your relationship. He created a situation that you wouldn't have agreed to if you knew the truth. I would be wary about marrying him, given this. Have you spoken with her? Surely she can understand that this is a big deal. "
"No, no, no, no, stop it. You should be talking (and working through) your marriage problems with your wife. This is literally how most emotional cheating starts.

You are not 100% correct. Nobody ever is. The fact that she is agreeing with you will just make you seek her out more, she'll become a closer friend and next thing you know your dick accidentally slipped in her pussy.

The good thing is you know enough to stop yourself. If it feels wrong it probably is. Disengage from this lady. Sign up for the counseling you've been putting up and put your efforts into fixing what you have. 

Edit: Also ask yourself when is the last time you told your wife everything about your life? Sometimes it's easy to fall into a pattern with our spouses and not talk to and interact with them like we should.  "
"See if you can find roommates to share an apartment with for that much per month. If not, run down to Home Depot and get 2 doorknobs that require key locks. They're like $10 a pop, and all you need is 5 minutes and a screwdriver to swap them out. Keep the doors locked at all times, and that will stop them from puking on your things."
"Ah, emotional abuse. Does such lovely things to your mind. 

You have done really well. You're doing everything right. I'm very glad you're away and working on healing and moving forward. You sound like a wonderful lady and a real catch for any man or woman you connect with in the future. "
"You have to be pregnant first of all. That could involve vomiting all day to the point of not keeping food down, breast pain, and a variety of other miserable symptoms that no one warns you about. This goes on until you are actually able to get the abortion. Could be weeks. Depending on your state (if it's in the U.S.), you may have to go to the doctor two or three times in order to complete the procedure. They may make you get a vaginal probe ultrasound so that you can see the cluster of cells for yourself. You may also have to drive of hundreds of miles for these appointments. You may need to walk through protesters yelling terrible things at you.

An abortion (surgical or medicinal) involves cramping to the point of expelling whatever is growing in your uterus. This could go on for awhile if it's the pill kind you take at home.

If another pregnancy happens, then you could repeat the process all over again.

A vasectomy involves going into a regular old doctor's office, local anesthesia, a couple snips, and discomfort for a day."
"Your family is insane. I'm sorry but that's all there is to it. 

The only possible mildly justifiable reason I can imagine - and I do mean MILDLY justifiable - is if their reaction is a result of you being bullied in the past and they somehow think that this might lead to more ""bullying"". That you might have an easier life with a taller husband. 

I don't know. They're probably just insane. Sorry."

How could you not tell your friend this immediately?
"Why not cut this overgrown 5-year old out of your lives? She's immature and jealous and has shown that she can't keep her behavior contained like an adult should. It's probably best if you make it very clear, one more time, that your sister needs to apologize. If she won't, then cut her out. Should you not do this, you can look forward to her bitching about your daughter's book(s) every time you see her."
"&gt; the best part about having diplomatic immunity

Saying it in an Afrikaans accent? Starring in a Lethal Weapon movie?"
"It sounds already like her lawers told her there was nothing to do, that's why she's ""hinting"" at them giving it back, cause she knows she has no right to ask for it. "
"Same thing as her kissing another guy, really...

This broad sounds like quite the headache.  Not only kissing some chick but posting it on social media. 

LOL.

Have fun buddy."
"As a parent you surely can see that your husband is right about this. It's not like Matt is complaining that his mom doesn't have food or neglects him. He just doesn't have as much fun there, and your husband is right that throwing his relationship with his mom under the bus just to have more fun at your house isn't a good idea."
"This. While I wouldn't want her to move in and not pay rent, if he can't see himself living with her at this point I don't think that's likely to change in the future. While she sounds like a spoiled brat, it seems like that's not a big part of the reason he doesn't want her to move in which means it's secondary to the fact that after 3 years he's still not ready to take the next step in their relationship. "
"&gt;- her family is allegedly a nightmare to deal with and she has small mental health things which make it even more awkward.

Too many red flags right there"
"Even if we place all the blame for the initial unfair prenup on OP's lawyer, he still comes out looking bad enough that I might be reconsidering the marriage in his fiancee's shoes.

He asks for a prenup, she's initially hurt but she agrees. This is all reasonable and normal. She secures representation with a lawyer that she can both afford and trust. Also reasonable, despite their past relationship.

The OP presents her with a prenup that is deeply unfair to her. Her lawyer points that out and starts negotiations. And what does the OP do?

He throws a fit and assumes it's some malicious action on the behalf of her lawyer (who he admits has been nothing but polite to him) to break up their relationship, rather than considering the fact that her lawyer's job is literally to negotiate the best possible deal for her. He can't point to anything in particular that the lawyer has done wrong except challenge that initial one-sided prenup.

I'd give a lot of leeway for that initial contract suggestion, but his reaction to her lawyer's very reasonable concerns is pretty off-putting. Even if Judy was fine at the start, she may be seeing a side of him she doesn't particularly like."
This is what I was going to say. Head over to r/JustNoMIL. I think you'll be posting a lot... She sounds like a treat. 
"I think you did the right thing. You can see he doesn't seem very bothered. You tried to talk about a big problem for you and he was pretty uncompromising so at least now you know where you stand. Best of luck in your next relationship, you're doing it right."
"OP says this behavior is very new, and NOT in line with how the sister usually acts. I think your personal experience is coloring your view of how this situation is."
"There's a lot of contempt for your sister on display here, but despite all that...I don't really see what she's done _wrong._

She doesn't have your work ethic? Okay...but she still managed to become fluent in two more languages, and find a good job in another country.  What does her choice not to  have kids have to do with anything? What does her joy in where she lives have to do with anything?

You are in a position of incredible stress and pain, and I can't effectively imagine where you are standing. But I've seen grief turn into rage and destroy families all too easily. And you are letting it fester in you. It's going to wreck you if you don't tone it down.

&gt;Charlotte doesn't need the money. We do.

Do you? It would make your life _easier_. But do you need it? Are your children going to starve if you don't have it?

Charlotte _can't_ quit her job and move back to Australia. I mean, she could--but have you actually considered the cost? Her husband can more than afford to support her, whee. Should he have to?

My recommendation would very strongly be that you see a counselor to start giving you some coping mechanisms to deal with this. You are going to turn into a person that will be a bad role-model for your kids, if you keep this up.  They'll llsten to how you talk about your sister and think _this is an acceptable way to treat family._ And they'll listen to how you talk about money, and think _money is more important than anything else._

"
"Also, make sure he doesn't put down ""family"" as all one thing."
"I understand him wanting to go on the trip, I'd have a bigger issue with him not planning ahead to make me feel important before he left. Your anniversary shouldn't have been an after thought. That's inconsiderate. "
"Yup, I'm guessing the mom and brother made a big deal out of this, ignoring the fact she already had plans. "
Damn dude.  That's some heavy stuff for a 16 year old.  I have sons your age. I couldn't even begin imagining them in a situation like yours without a parent to be supportive.  Do you have grandparents?
I had a yeast infection at the age of 7 from too many bubble baths as a kid. There is no age limit for them. 
My husband and I went to marriage counseling too. I kept saying how I didn't think it was working. He wasn't following through on the promises he made in there. Finally the counselor looked at me and said why should he change? He's perfectly happy with this marriage regardless of the things he's doing. You're the one that's not happy.
Really - I'm almost 37 and I feel like OP feels worse about her age than I do about mine. :/ 
"Why is this such a big deal for you? You're 31 not 13.

Is he a good boyfriend otherwise? Does he cherish you, love you etc etc?

You are being a total brat. I feel sorry for him!"
"Reach out to your former SIL and let her know that you have just learned that your parents, uncle and brother are all using meth and you will support her if she would like to reach out to CPS in order to only have supervised visitation.  You can't force your family to change, to stop meth, to be sober around the 4 year old so I would take the necessary steps to prevents them from being around the 4 year old."
"Would you also find it understandable if a teen caused a traffic accident and permanently hurt someone because they were on their phone while driving? Because according to your logic it's not that big a deal because:

 - Lots of teens do it.

 - They have fun while doing it.

 - They happen to be unlucky doing it this one time that it caused an accident. 

Yeah, keep calling people who disagree with you ""harsh old ladies"". At least I never blinded someone. 
"
If they were in Canada they wouldn't have to raise 100k for the health procedure. 
Why is it always the mentally ill route? Maybe she's just miserable and a fucking asshole?
"It really just depends on the severity. If all they were doing was having fights, he obviously should not be running to his parents. If she was legitimately going into a RAGE and unable to leave him alone, it is reasonable to expect that he'd leave the house.

We have no way of knowing which one it is. 

FWIW, I completely agree that people should not run to others with their personal/private issues any time an issue comes up. But there is definitely a line where it moves from ""relationship issues"" to ""verbal abuse"". If it was truly to the point where he could not be in the house with her when she went off, where else is he going to go? Unless he wants to dish out $150 every time his wife becomes a loon, it is understandable that he would go to his parents' home.

* And this is coming from someone who thinks parents should stay farrrrrrr away from relationships, as I am in a LTR with someone whose mother disliked me for a very long time (probably deep down still does)"
She also might be upset because it sounds like he spends more time with this female coworker than he spends with her 
Why are you here if you're shooting down everyone's advice?
"I genuinely am flabbergasted by how rude and entitled she's acting. Holy shit, her mama did not teach her right if at all."
"What did you expect? You taught him that he can cheat on you, be discovered, and suffer no consequences. You taught him that you value his happiness over your own self respect. You taught him that you don't think cheating is that big a deal."

"'Beating ass' should *never* be an option, dude. Your roommate is jealous and a genuine asshole at that. Seriously. Your life will improve when he is no longer in it."
"It's not right for her to hide abortions/miscarriages/whatever happened here. 

However, he hasn't even brought it up to his wife. He has no clue what happened. Neither does his sister. He is taking his wife's private medical information to someone else. 

I am okay with venting outside of a relationship to a certain degree. This, however, is completely not okay. Hiding things is not okay. Spilling private things to your sister before talking to your wife is not okay. "
"Dude, if you only want advice that aligns with exactly what you want to hear, then why did you even post? 

You seem like a very angry/bitter person."
"I fell for a guy a few years ago. I found a lot of things about him admirable, and so many things about his personality and physical appearance were so attractive to me that I was kind of hooked, infatuated.

But our relationship sucked. He did all of the things you mention. He would invite me to hang with his friends and it was as if I had vanished from his presence. He wouldn't even acknowledge me. If I talked to him, he would look right through me and ignore me. If I tried to add to a group conversation he would literally talk over me or steer the conversation away from whatever direction I was taking it and toward a topic he knew I couldn't participate or be interested in.

If we were walking somewhere and I stopped to tie my shoe or something, he would continue on at full speed. If I asked him to wait he would call me a needy psycho. If he got done at a store or restaurant before me, he would just head to the car. Many times (before I caught on to his dick ways) I would go to the restroom after dinner at a restaurant and come back to an empty table feeling confused. One time he even left my fucking purse sitting there)

I could go on and on. I would tell him how these things made me feel insignificant and he would tell me that I was insecure, crazy, spoiled.

My dumb ass stayed with him until he dumped me. And guess what he told me? ""I never really liked you, anyway.""
Shocker.

You're boyfriend is a fucking dick and he doesn't give a shit about you. Get out and find a guy who enjoys your company and treats you like someone who matters to him."
"The problem is that given the fact that it sounds like her brother is fairly well off if she moves out he'll just hire a nanny and keep digging his head in the sand and then there's no one there to watch out for the kid's best interest(most nannies aren't going to risk their job to speak up against him and even if they did he can just fire them). I'm not sure what the solution is to get him to listen, but I don't think moving out will work. "
"I think you take this one for the team. Taking something from your husband because of a bunch of gross alcoholics seems like letting those bastards win.

Willfully re-associate the name with his father, whom your husband admires for good reason. Get the family to tell you stories about why they love and admire him. Embrace your new family. Give your son *that* legacy."
"This. If the bf made it to the list, then he should cough up the cash"
"It's *INSANE* that a teacher can assign some bullshit coloring homework during exams week.  Coloring in high school?

"Not in the middle of an argument and not without it being super obvious, plus if she only started recording after the abusive comment started by that point she'd have missed half the comment anyway. Daughter went into this conversation pre-recording, and why else would she do that unless she KNEW it was coming, which makes it seem like OP here isn't the parental saint she's claiming to be. "
Just be aware that it will eventually affect you as well if people stop inviting you to hang out because they don't want to hang out with your boyfriend. 
"I would hate you too. In fact, I was in his shoes before."

"Oh wow, ""all the housework"" for 2 people.  She's freeloading.   I'm a woman, and it's not sexist.  I'd say the same if the guy were at home all day. I'm sure the book club is exhausting, but..."
"I named the family cat ""Wigglebutt"" when I was 5. That cat lived until I was 20. He was the best."
"Yes.  This guy presumably wanted and planned for his three year old, given that it happened during his marriage.  Someone you're banging because they have the same work schedule is *not* a life partner and you're *not* going to change your level of commitment because they got knocked up."
"Typically his response goes to a guilt trip. Usually ""you never want to spend time together anymore."" He knows that I'm not a movie person. I honestly hate watching movies unless I can multitask while doing so. Therefore I don't want to watch the stupid action movie that he's watching. 

So he throws this guilt trip on me about how I *never* want to spend time with him, and when I do, I'm always on my phone. I hate watching movies, so of course I'm going to distract myself with something else to do."
Yea I got that feeling too. This post got more white wash than the fence in Tom Sawyer.
"I mean, I literally don't have that much left in my monthly budget right now and I'd put that shit on my credit card or go begging to friends/family if it meant I could be there for my SO or even a good friend at a time like this."
"It doesn't sound like she's offended here. It sounds like she's unnecessarily beating herself up and stressing out over him because she realizes that she wasn't making him enough food in the morning. It sounds like she's upset about him not communicating his food needs, not about him having food needs. I think that she's overreacting, both to herself and to her bf, but I don't think that she would have been upset, offended, or angry if he asked her to make him a bigger meal in the morning. I also think that it's possible that he didn't ask for more food because he likes getting his hot dog in the morning and that he doesn't want to rely on her for all of his meals because she already does a lot for him."

"My partner and I are 30 and 28 respectively and love watching anime together. There's nothing childish about it and if you're only watching a couple of episodes a day, it's not like you're being excessive. 

Maybe talk to her about why she feels anime is for kids and show her some episodes to see if she's open to changing her mind? Either way, I don't think you should give this up for her."
"Definitely, that one little ""I'm jealous"" comment was a true as true can be.  She's just being petty and jealous."
"&gt;She said that when she gets her life in order **she hopes the ring will still be waiting for her. FUCK THAT.**
Then on the very awkward car ride back she says that she would accept it as a promise ring, and we can turn it into an engagement ring when shes ready. NOPE I didn't even respond. I was in shock. **She asked if I would be willing to propose again later. Pshhh**
Heres the deal. I can return the ring in 60 days and get my money back. I am not going to wait indefinitely for her to ""come around"". Shes going through a lot of personal stuff right now, so I can understand her reasoning, but fuck man. **Shes really going to make me do this again. Should I tell her straight up that if she doesn't come to me within the next 59 days I'm taking the ring back, and its over?**

This is the last I'll say about it.  Read what you wrote.

It's okay to be upset- I would be.  What I'm trying to make you understand is, you will NOT have a happy marriage to ANYONE if you treat your SO like this whenever you have a fight or problem.  Again, yes, it's not like most of your problems are going to be as huge as a rejected proposal, but there will be times where decisions have to be made about very big, serious things.  There will be words said that really hurt your feelings.  There will be conflict and difficult problems, at least once or twice, because marriage is a partnership through the messy unpredictable journey of life, and life isn't always easy.

If you cannot see the part you played in this situation, and accept fault, you will not have a happy marriage.  I grew up with parents like this.  Don't go down that road.  I am not trying to beat you up here, I'm trying to show you that it's unfair to treat her one way and then get mad when there are consequences for your actions.  She was completely within her rights to reject your second proposal after you backed out of the first one, and your callous reaction to her rejection makes me think you don't put yourself in her shoes enough.  You asked her to become more independent, and she's trying to follow through, even though I'm very sure she was devastated when you took it back.  She needed time to build up trust again.  Instead, you tried to re-propose and then got mad when she was hesitant.  Your girlfriend seems to want a marriage, not just a wedding, and that's a really good thing!  She wants to work on your relationship, make sure it's strong before you get married.  You can be upset, but you need to admit that you had some fault here."
Encourage her to go to her sister's or her friend's but don't get sucked back in.
Plus there's the whole mum didn't seem to give a shit for seven years part.
"Glad it worked out for you, but your version of ""me"" was kind of nuts in your earlier post."

"TIL I'm a bad person for laughing out loud at your ""HEYOH!""

Of course, the comparison is very appropriate. He'd lose his mind, as would your family, if you said any of that. Don't let him do the same thing to you. "
"Thanks for your thoughtful reply... I'll give some more info because I'd like to hear more of your opinion. 

We tend to by homebodies more than anything, and much of that is due to my crazy work schedule which leaves her by herself for about 7 nights a month (I work 12 hour shifts, which about 20% are graveyards) so she does get lonely at home without me. 

This crazy work schedule also affords me big chunks of time off, so we tend to plan getaways during my time off. Just last month, I planned a weekend with just us two away to watch the opening soccer game of the Copa America in San Francisco (we live in the PNW). We flew down there, stayed in a hotel, went to the game, had a great time, then came home. Less than a year ago, we traveled to Vancouver BC, this summer we're trying to plan a camping trip with friends, and later this year I'm trying to talk her into letting us spend the money to visit my college roommate in Argentina. So I definitely try to include her on as much as possible, because I love traveling and being with her! 

The event in question that I'm planning to go to is an MLS soccer game. We've been to one them together before, but not for awhile, so I think she's upset that we don't go to more soccer games together? But I'm not really sure, I should ask her I guess..."
"This woman threatened to have you institutionalized if you left her.

Not only is she selfish and lazy, she's also incredibly manipulative. Of course she wants to stay together, otherwise she'll actually have to find a job, work, support herself.

You did a good thing for yourself by separating. You had become a shadow of yourself and when you realized you didn't have to be burdened with her, you got out of your rut and lived again. Keep living for yourself, you don't need to be tied to this dead weight."
"Consensual non-consent it a thing if that's what you're talking about, but that needs to be thoroughly discussed with safewords/boundaries before you even try anything like that!"
Damn. I was happy enough when my dad gave me £200 toward my first car. 
"This exactly. She started dating him when he was broke, helped out when the business was struggling for free, and stayed by him through her youth. He was not only ungrateful, but paid her back by asking for a horribly unfair prenup that any decent lawyer would have scrutinized and crucified the same way.

My husband and I got married when he was a poor student, no prenup, and I helped support him during that time. We've been happily married for many years now, have two kids, during which time my career stagnated, and his career took off after grad school. We've never had fights about finances because we're a team, and he knows that the time and love I gave him back then helped him get to where he is. 

This guy sound like an asshole because of his new wealth, which is mostly his father's. She didn't care about a prenup, yet her family is wealthy and has assets that she would likely inherit. He wants to pretend that she is suddenly going to become a gold digger after sticking it out with him through his early poor years. He's the one shitting on their relationship, not the ex and not her."
"OK. It is your right to never speak to her again, but I will say a few things. Like you, I think that most people don't really change. That said, you don't know for sure that she hasn't. I agree that the chances are slim, but it's possible. 

I'll also say this: your parents are part of the problem. She never could have staged these ""interventions"" without their help. Also - what did they try to do to correct her as a teenager? Did they try? Do you think anything they did would have made any difference?

On to your brother. You have a few options here. You should talk to him and explain that if she *really* loved you, if this was really about her love for you, then she would respect your wishes and leave you alone. The fact that she won't just indicates that these little displays on her part are about her and her needs, whatever they are - her need to be loved? her need to be near a successful person? her need to alleviate her guilt? who knows. Your brother might understand this and he might not. But indicate to him that it is deeply inappropriate, on her part and on your parents', to involve him in this dispute. 

If your brother follows through on his threat to end contact with you, I guess you have to decide what to do at that point."
"Yes. Making a scene won't accomplish anything, because the family is used to accommodating SIL's tantrums.

OP, you're not the bad guy here. I think you and your husband should prepare yourself to never ask SIL and BIL for help ever again, and also never help THEM with anything. I do think you should tell them that they stole your car and you are disappointed. 

Did your husband agree to let them keep the car another week? Did you? (It sounds like you didn't.) If not, I do think you are within your rights to call them and tell them you want the car back right now. However, be aware that they are probably NOT going to pay you for the rental, ever, and they are also not going to do the oil change they promised.

Never loan them anything again, or in fact trust them again. "

"If she doesn't stop hanging out with her, she's clearly not as committed as you, and not as committed as she should be, and you should divorce her. I'm 100% dead serious here. You can continue fighting for a lost cause but if your wife doesn't care (which, considering her reaction to all this, it seems that she doesn't, or marginally so), you shouldn't waste your time. I mean you could wait for things to escalate, but your wife  isn't respecting you or your marriage."

"This comment is so harsh but makes me laugh so hard just because of this line: ""FYI all girls you date from now on will always be shorter relationships than how long you've known your child-hood friends - that's just how time works. Idiot."" Which is SO SO true. OP you pledged the REST OF YOUR LIFE TO THIS WOMAN, not just 4 years! And you know what's in 11 years?? YOUR 15th YEAR WEDDING ANNIVERSARY! Are you going to be celebrating that shit with your so-called friends? NO. Because guess which relationship is more important???"

"If you had been working then I would say expecting some rent would not be unreasonable (though some parents don't even want that tbh), but if you were unemployed and suffering from debilitating mental illness then they should have been supporting you like loving, responsible parents. Had they said 'no don't get Medicaid, we'll put you on our policy so you can get better medical help' that would have been another story, but no, they didn't want to help they just didn't want you to 'seem poor'.
They can shove their bill. Tell them if you'd known they were going to charge you for being a parent, you'd have paid for professional support instead."
"Sadly, you're not showing them how insane she allegedly is. If she changed, whether you care or not, everything you're doing at the moment makes YOU look like the insane one.

You're gonna lose your family for some time while this happens if you don't look for another way that doesn't put you in a worse light."

"Your sister is sexually assaulting you. You need to tell your parents. Yes it's embarrassing, yes it will be awkward, yes it will be uncomfortable. I know. But you need to tell your parents because your sister is sexually assaulting you and you deserve to be safe. 

You say she's never been like this before, I wonder if she could have an organic issue. Brain tumors can completely change peoples behaviors. There was a post or story I read years back from a woman who's dad had suddenly become overtly sexual towards her.

"It's so sad that this is probably what needs to happen. That hearing this from a totally different person with a degree will somehow make what OP is already telling him hold weight. I'd hope my partner would take my word for it and understand biology well enough to realize that this is an extraordinary circumstance.

Does he not see how she's lost so much weight so quickly and can't actually eat anything? Is he oblivious to her physical health? I hope she's going to be ok because this amount of weight loss combined with months of what is essentially starvation would be a lot for a non-pregnant woman to handle... "
"Marriage is not a magical fix for relationships, it's a *magnifying glass*. If things are not good right now, they'll only get worse after marriage.

All of his ""tests"" are manipulative, controlling, and seriously unhealthy. You know what a mature person would do if they had these concerns? They would sit down with their partner and have a real conversation about them. They wouldn't make their partner jump through hoops to ""proove"" themselves. Don't marry this dude, OP."
"Well, you probably aren't going to like either of my answers.

First, you can't really tell someone what they can or can't do in public legally.  Know this though.  Having a carry license means a few things.  You have been background checked, trained, and are registered with the state as being a concealed weapons carrier.  No one can know that you are carrying.  To even have your weapon show is a crime called brandishing.  All carriers will go to extreme lengths to make sure no one is aware.  Also, things like drinking are stritly prohibited.  There is no chance that you are at any risk from a concealed carrier simply having a firearm any more than a police officer concealing one while they are off duty.  Which they are required to do.  If you are ever out with any off duty cops, I guarantee they are armed.

Second, in my state as many as 13% of the population is now licensed.  That means if you are in a room with 100 people you can expect that somewhere around 13 or them are armed.  It's pretty ubiquitous at this point.  You are likely around someone with a loaded firearm every day and just don't know it.  I can't help you with your level of discomfort but wanted to share the facts.

"Honestly the foods she likes aren't bad. You need to compromise too! There's somewhere in between is all. You shouldn't feel embarrassed to serve pot roast to guests, but you should be able to try things too. 
It sounds like she needs to try more but also like you're a little extreme yourself."
"Okay, first of all, we dont know a lot about you except that you are a truck. Cute analogy, but what I read from it, is that you are very insecure about yourself. I don't know if that's also how you talk about yourself in real life, but it's not very attractive. Sure you can be insecure, but if you let shine through that you only ask for 1500 when you know you're worth 3000, I'd feel insulted. Because you are basically telling girls that they are what you settle for even when its less than you think you deserve. 

Also, if you love someone for you they are always 10/10, even if others think they are a 4/10.  

To me it comes across that you are not looking for love, you are just looking for a girl. Any girl, whatever. And that is one aweful way of looking at it.

You also seem not wanting to commit to anything. So why would anyone want to commit to you?"

"Holy...I just read the other post too. I scrolled up twice to check the wife's age and was still stunned the second time bc she's the same age as me. 

Actually she sounds so much like my friend (my grade school/high school/college bff). She was an absolute nightmare to her husband and he was a very good man - handsome, well-educated, successful, kind. She treated him much in this same manner and he chalked it up to her being high-maintenance. Our group of friends always felt bad for him in situations where we'd all go out and she acted like a complete bitch for no reason whatsoever. 

Now they are divorced, he's happily dating a lovely woman and my friend is alone and miserable bc no other grown man wants to put up with that crap, even as attractive as she is. "
"Yes, this op, don't come in angry as you will look like the parent who can't control their anger. Come in with facts and logic. 
Say:
My child has been bullied x amount of times, we tried to fix it when...., we tried to speak to him about resolving this issue. We went to meeting a b c with his classroom teachers (quote dates and what you discussed) we then felt those had no choice but to send him to self defence classes because nobody listened to us. 
They will then tell you how they spoke to his parents and teachers. Then ask why hasn't anything changed? I still feel frustrated that no one can adequately discipline this child but when my child has enough he is put in a situation where he felt he had no choice but to use aggression. I don't want him using violence either but we are not going to let him be bullied. Perhaps you only care about your enrolments and the funding you lose when kids like this leave. Can I see the discipline policy? What are the consequences for a b c ? Why isn't anything changing if you are using your own policy? 

If you are not getting anywhere at this stage say that you can report an assault if the child is over ten years of age or if you can go higher and ask who the principal's boss is. Seriously as a teacher I hate seeing these kids bullying a vulnerable child. You parents have more power than you think. Most teachers want to say this to parents : we hate these bullies too"

"That was my thought too - my ex told his friends and his mom about every conflict we had and every not-great thing about me. Any time I messed up, I'd catch him glaring at me while texting his friends/family. He didn't tell them about his mistakes, and I didn't have any way to give my side of things, so they thought I was trash. 

Over time, the knowledge that our problems were on display for his entire social network made me reluctant to have honest conversations with him. I felt like I had to have my guard up all the time. 

While couples counseling is a good idea, OP would benefit from individual counseling regardless of how his marriage turns out. An unbiased third party would be able to help him identify how his actions might be affecting his relationships, communicate with his wife effectively, and set up appropriate boundaries with his parents."

"I made another comment in the thread talking about how you can tie your desire for cooking new things to her desire to keep a food schedule. Most kids respond well to food schedules, too...and it's easy to keep them on a healthy diet that way.  

If you can afford to have versatility in your cooking, then you can afford a compromise easily! Just have a few days a week where you or she cooks what she wants/trusts, and have a couple days where you cook something new. She tastes what you cook, and if she doesn't like it, then she can eat her leftovers or sandwich or something reliable/trustworthy to her tastes. 

This is also easy enough to budget if you have a good understanding of protein/veg costs in your area. Allow yourself some freedom to experiment, but also allow her to have her security in her known foods. 

You can do both! It will take some effort but it will be fun, and you might be able to convince her to love some new dishes! 

As far as convincing her to try new dishes, maybe you can start with her trusted proteins and then go from there...try and keep your recipes in line with the style of cooking she likes, but do it your way. Slowly add in new ingredients. 

Good luck :) "
"I dated a guy with CF for 1.5 years in high school. We were in drumline together. I'm still impressed at how active he was. They called him the miracle boy at the hospital whenever he had to go.

Even though we were 17ish high school kids he never had that attitude. He *did* have a tell, though. When he was flagging his eyes would become rimmed with pink, especially at the corners. There were a couple of times i had to tell him he was pushing too hard. (He wrestled, too.) He would actually apologize for putting me in that position.

That being said he could also get angry at times. I heard the not so subtle ""You're on borrowed time,"" comments from family and health professionals. At 18 they became even worse. Our families were even pressuring us to get married citing his potential lifespan. 

She's at the age where her health is gonna nosedive if it hasn't already. (My ex died at 31, double lung transplant was rejected.) I would let her know that you are here for her, which you've probably already done. I would suggest a hand signal. If i get overwhelmed (by a different medical condition) i have a signal with my SO where i touch my thumb to chin and he knows to get me out of there or at least ask if i'm ok. I can understand how she may feel scared to verbalize she's not feeling well. It's like admitting you're one step closer to death.

Oh, another good rule of thumb i used for him was if he's sweating he probably feels shitty. Salt crystals would literally form on his arm when he let it get too far. I think a big reason his illness didn't effect our relationship is because we talked about what his needs were up front before it came up in the wild. I would also explain to your lady that no matter what you **think** she's feeling you will always accept what she **says** she's feeling as the truth. Any other reaction would be treating her like a child. Oh, the ex's parents did treat him like a child much longer than they should have. They honestly never thought they would have to adjust to him being an adult.

Edit: to say this was in the early 2000s. They talked about how research was finally getting better with advances in genetics. She may have longer than they did back then. The human genome was still being mapped at that time."

"Why does she think it will be difficult to stay faithful after 30 and why is she sharing that with this dude?

Also: knowing you share devices and log in to each other's Facebooks on occasion, why would she leave this out in the open so carelessly if she really was cheating? Aren't cheaters usually a bit more clandestine, even people who plan to cheat in... five years?"
"I had a similar reaction. I have read HUNDREDS of /r/relationships posts, and this is the first one to make me actually tear up. I feel SO bad for her. This guy is just. plain. awful. Awful to the point that it's creepy. Thinking about this dude's behavior actually makes my skin crawl. I think I would have thrown up on him if he tried to do that ""I love you I love you I love you"" shit in the car after a display like his in the craft store. There is something VERY wrong with this man. He is most certainly emotionally abusive.

OP, please, please, please read ""Why Does He Do That,"" by Lundy Bancroft. You need help. This man is a manipulator, and you are going to need some real tools to help you stand up for yourself (if you choose to stay with him)."
"You say he knows he's arrogant, but does he try to fix it? Or does he not provoke you anymore because he realizes he can't beat you, and not because it's not nice to be an arrogant person? 

There's a huge difference here. You need to cut out the sugarcoating and tell him straight, ""Hey, you need to stop being arrogant, such as when you did this [list of stuff] because it makes everyone awkward. No one else acts like this because they're courteous. You need to be courteous when you're socializing. So stop."""
"Heya I have BP2 also &amp; you have a lot to cope with right now, absolutely you need better support here! 

Some things that stand out to me are you are perhaps expecting him to get involved in some things you could just do yourself - eg sorting baby clothes is something you may be able to manage better than him, if he has no opinion on baby clothes it will waste time &amp; also annoy him to be consulted on every single aspect of all decision making to that nitty gritty detail. Maybe you're trying to be collaborative but it could come across as overwhelming? 

Also you're about to have twins, so you're gonna have to ease up on things like clean laundry unfolded in a basket. Pretty soon you'll likely be happy it was washed &amp; who cares about wrinkles your body heat actually removes most wrinkles on fabrics! It's really not the end of the world. 

If you need new clothes then of course you should get them, also perhaps lots of 'maternity' stuff is a scam &amp; you could find other suitable cheap clothes to wear that won't break the budget? $100 at Kmart would get you some new pieces &amp; it doesn't all have to be 'maternity' branded. 

Now the room is cleared maybe things like setting up crib or painting room will be things he might be able to get more enthused about that stuff? Maybe you say 'hey you pick the wall color &amp; I'll do the decorating' or something collaborative like that?

With BP you must ensure you see getting your rest &amp; good sleep hygiene. Your man also needs rest from work, can you have one day a weekend as your sleep in day &amp; then next day to tackle one chore? I personally feel lack of sleep is a huge trigger for stress &amp; hyponess"

"I'm not suggesting they invite her on the trip, OP's parents could go on the trip by themselves and just hire a translator/guide. Unfortunately there aren't really any good options in this situation, OP has to choose what is more important the trip to France or having a relationship with her sister. I'm not saying one option is any better or worse than the other, I'm just pointing out that OP's hopes of going on the trip and not making her sister mad are probably unreasonable. "
I agree with this timing
"It really doesn't. I'm 12 years older than my girlfriend. I treat her as an equal, her family loves me, and people tell us we're a cute couple everywhere we go. It's the healthiest relationship either of us have ever had.

"Agreed. I attended a major university and shelled out 16k the first year.  It drained my college fund and I realized in the end,  my diploma may not have the fancy name but I wouldn't be 40k+ in the hole.

I worked full time and paid my way through college (thanks to my parents who didn't charge me rent).  It's possible, and OP doesn't owe her stepdaughter anything. "
This whole situation is crazy.  Never bought her a plane ticket? Never been verbally carded for alcohol? Never talked about stuff from your childhood? There's a huge difference in what would have been popular a decade apart. Never seen any of her high school or college friends on social media?

"The thing that would bother me most here is not even the wedding attendance (though I would want and expect a husband to come to his sister-in-law's wedding unless one of his siblings or his very best friend in the world was getting married the same day).  It's that he didn't even have the courtesy to fulfill your ENTIRELY reasonable request that he tell your sister when he made the decision.

Different people may have different views on which wedding to go to in a situation like this.  But once he RSVP'd to your sister, there is NO legitimate viewpoint in which deciding to go to a different wedding instead doesn't require a very sincere apology to the person you're backing out on, particularly when that person is *your spouse's sibling*.  If he had called her as soon as he made the decision and told her how sorry he was and that he'd like to take you and her and her fiancé out for a pre- or post-wedding dinner to toast their marriage, I think missing the wedding would probably have gone down fine with her.  But not bothering to let her know for a period of time (during which she was probably counting on that RSVP when making catering arrangements, etc.), and then when SHE brought it up just going ""oh yeah, turns out I can't come""?  That's beyond rude.  It shows total disrespect for both your sister as the person he's ditching with no attempt at being polite about it, and to you as her sister.  Especially when he knows you're upset about him missing it, not bothering to be polite about HOW he's missing it is like spitting in your face."
"It's probably best to put a pause on the open relationship for now. People can say they want something, but later realize they don't feel great about it in practice. While it's clear to you that the other guy is purely just for the sex, taking action to support those words will build greater trust. It'll be better for the relationship in the long run, whether you decide to open it up again or keep it closed.

On seeing the same/different people: not a comment on whether one option is better than another, but I would be very careful if you both decide to change partners often since it increases your exposure to STDs. Please be super on top of it if you choose to go this route. I only say that because I have close friends who knew what they were doing still get STDs, and I'd feel guilty if I didn't make a note of it here."

"Definitely lock down your social media accounts to where strangers can't view your profile or send you messages.

Save any messages you get, download the video where she talks about you, make a record of all your interactions with this girl. 

Yeah, maybe you shouldn't have ghosted her, but that's absolutely no excuse for what she's done. You definitely don't deserve this kind of treatment. "
"Sounds like you guys are communicating well with each other!

A word of advice about the OCD stuff, though. If you keep reassuring him and letting him satisfy his 'checking', the cycle will just continue and escalate. It's probably the best thing to do for now, but I think this is something he should address with a therapist or counselor. Checking is no fun for anyone involved, and it usually does intensify. I used to be a mod on an OCD forum and I saw things like this a lot from your boyfriend's perspective...it usually got worse when it wasn't addressed. If he doesn't sit with the anxiety, it will continue to be a problem. Reassurance is not the solution!

Good luck!"

"I agree with the substance regarding her poor decisions and expectations of OP, but I think you're being pretty harsh.

I think she's mostly reacting emotionally to her little buddy being in trouble. It's so fucking hard to be practical in that situation. 

Yeah, she may be as monumentally irresponsible as you're saying, but she also might be an alright 26 yo with a sick dog that she loves and doesn't have thousands of dollars lying around to fix. Most people don't. (62% of people don't have $1000 in savings, if I correctly recall a front page post from today.) 

That said, it's not practical to spend that much on a sick old dog, but you don't get to make that decision for everyone. 

It sucks and puts OP in a tough spot, but hopefully he can find a kind way to tell her that he loves her and understands why she's asking such a huge thing.. But he has to rationally and pragmatically decline due to the implications it will have on his future."

What if you just had dinner with your son (and his partner if he has one)?

It could be uncomfortable for her because she is so close to them in age...I know that would make me uncomfortable."
Disgusting. He is 25 years old and he doesn't brush his teeth!? Break up with him just for poor hygiene. So gross.
"Don't marry someone you don't want your finances tied to. 

Having a separate account is fine but to completely hide over 100k a year is deceitful. "
"If it causes a rift, that is on your friend. I don't impose my kids on other people. "
Just tell her you'll go to the next wedding OP. ;)
"&gt; Is it normal to be called a 'fucking bitch' by the person who is supposed to love you?

No, and name-calling is the opposite of ""grown-up language"".

You shouldn't be in a relationship with someone who gets mad at you a lot and especially to this degree. A relationship should build you up and make you feel good, not afraid of angering someone."
"&gt; a decade his junior, because she'll put up with this kind of crap from him.

bingo"
He could give up cigarettes. That would give him plenty of extra cash for the occasional spur of the moment rib purchase.
He should also go to the principal and superintendent. 
"I'm 28. I teach high schoolers. I'm not even remotely attracted to any of them. Do some of them look like adult men already? Sure. But they live at home, don't have fully developed brains yet, and act like fools. Turns my vagina into the Sahara Desert."
"I don't think there would be anyway to convince me that &gt;$300K in debt will be ""okay"". 

Do you have a plan for paying all of this off? That is MASSIVE debt. Why do you have 8K in credit card debt? Does that indicate poor spending habits on your part? Did you go to medical school or something? It doesn't sound like it if you're only making 80K per year
"
Does **she** ever plan events for both of you?
Don't stay with people who don't accept you for who you are....
"Exactly! This isn't just about having no filter! 

No filter, no class, no respect for his fiance, no social awareness, no remorse... There's a lot of things this guy doesn't have. The fact that so many of these raunchy jokes came to his brain (when they clearly weren't even landing, ugh) and that he just treated OP like a piece of ass is ridiculous. How is that an OK way to behave or even think? 

These parents are cool as fuck. I don't think I would've lasted so long, and I'm not prudish. But it doesn't just sound like he works in an ""all male"" environment -- it sounds like he, personally, has a very sexist sense of humor. "
"I have told some close friends and my sister, but other than that, I don't tell anyone (about the chromosomes). I'm open about having ""ovarian cancer"" when I was a teenager, so when people ask me if I can have kids, I say no. The infertility, i am super open about. I'm also open about not wanting kids at all. I just feel bad about keeping this a secret, but it's not like I have a secret family on the other side of the country or anything...just a genetic disorder the negative results of which I would have already disclosed."
"Those are signs of being underweight. If she isn't experiencing those symptoms, she might still have a problem with food but she's not in the danger zone, so to speak. I'd still apologize and ask her about her relationship with food. "
"I'm afraid it might be him after all. A lot of guys with controlling anger issues hide it as long as they can to make you feel comfortable. 

Think about it - if every abusive guy punched his date in the face when they went out for the first time, no one would be in an abusive relationship.  They keep it under control until they feel like you won't leave. He's reached that point. "
"If you read the original post they were broken up when he pulled this stunt, he had no right to do what he did and make her feel like shit for hanging with a friend and honestly she has every right to hookup with that friend. They weren't exclusive and she owed OP nothing. He was being honestly creepy and possessive over a girl who he wasn't even dating at the time."
"Yeah, ""I aborted because I wasn't sure if I could trust this guy"" is not the same as ""I aborted the baby to make him upset"".

That said I wouldn't blame you if this was something you couldn't get over and it ended your relationship."
"and police, because that is illegal as fuck"
"So people in abusive relationships are responsible?

Frankly: hell no. 

There is a lot to the psychology of why people stay with those who are bad for them. On the outside, it's easy to say ""Well, you should have just left"" but that isn't how it works. "
"If I have a promising first date with someone, I won't sleep with my FWB after that. I gave the heads up to Zelda that I was going on a date so she'd know I might not be around after. So effectively I'm pausing things before the date."
Sounds like you should move on.
Your brothers are fucking psychos. Call the damn police and file a report. They need to be in jail. This wasn't a harmless prank. Your brothers assaulted your boyfriend. 
"If you are going to stay married to this guy, at a minimum you need to completely separate your finances. Have your own savings, investments and accounts that only you have access to. Both of you contribute equally (since you said you make similar salaries) to bills, rent and other shared expenses. If he wants to spend his own money bailing out people who don't deserve it, that's his problem. Bonus, this will also make it a lot easier and less messy to separate if this relationship doesn't work out.

But separately, think about whether you want to be with someone who's financially irresponsible, apparently has anger problems and a bad temper, communication problems and is prepared to support a repeated child molester (even if that person is his father!). I mean, I could sort of understand being in denial if a loved one faced one such accusation, but this is the second time at least that this has happened! Also think about what the prospect of having kids with this man would mean (if you want kids). Would he expect your FIL to be allowed access/to have a relationship with them?! How would you feel about that?"
"Honestly I'm with /u/mm172 on this.  There was quite a bit in your post that had me thinking you're gift giving is mostly about how good it makes you feel, and doesn't really take into account what Joey or his parents feel.  

Case in point, you gave them a big playset that would, I suspect, dominate the playroom.    Later, you're all put out because they haven't erected ""Aunt Indigopearl's Table.""  But all of this stems from the fact that *you* thought that table was the best use of the space in *their* house.  And maybe I'm a bit out of line here, but I think there was also some desire to plant your flag in Joey's life."
"fuck that noise. he's not assessing what kind of wife/mom you'll be, he's testing to see how far he can push and manipulate you before you stand your ground.  that should have been about 10 'tests' ago.  the last one is the real deal breaker IMO. he's threatening you with leaving you for another woman if you aren't willing to preform how he wants sexually.  that is so far beyond unacceptable.  run girl before you are legally bound to this douche."
"I don't usually advocate for the passive aggressive approach but.. 

Sit down right in front of her and have a conversation with a car rental salesperson about rates and options. When she looks offended or asks why, just state you were HOPING to get out and see some stuff in the area and you WOULD have brought you own car if she hadn't insisted that you could use one of theirs. But since the car hasn't been available you are going to rent one.

Let ber be upset. Tell her you don't appreciate feeling like a kid asking permission when you could have easily brought your own and not needed to ask. "
"You can't convince her to move on.

Have you consulted with a divorce lawyer? There is no single US law on divorce. There are 50 state laws dealing with divorce plus whatever the divorce laws are in territories. What law applies will depend on what state or territory you are living in when you get divorced. 

Diplomatic immunity protects you from prosecution for certain criminal offenses but I don't know if it's relevant in divorce proceedings at all. A divorce lawyer would be the person to ask that question."
"Oh hell no. If he doesn't go get them this weekend, call his mom and tell her, ""My husband gave you something that wasn't his to give. I will be coming up this weekend to pick up my planters that were taken without my knowledge or permission.""

Then go get what's yours and stash them somewhere OTHER than your house. If your husband asks, tell him you'll bring that back into the house once you trust him enough not to give your things away and shows even an ounce of remorse.

I'm so angry on your behalf."
"If one of my parents was abusing their dogs, I'd give them lots of ice tea.  Then they'd have to pee really bad.  The second they went to the loo, I'd load the dogs in the car, and speed away, never to return.  But, that's just me."
Are you in the US?  Is this an arranged marriage?
"Goddamn dude that is a depressing way to look at life!

I earn 250k now but when my wife and I started dating, I was broke. She flew me out to see her (long distance) on her dime. 

You seem to have this idea that women are only interested in money. That's a dangerous and frankly offensive idea. There are plenty of women out there earning good money who would love to be with you (assuming you're not a total asshole.) 

Life is what you make it. Women are not gold diggers. Find someone you click with and who you're compatible with."
"""I see her as a semi-nymph who wants to get gangbanged but never got around to it... Not judging though!""

"Should have said he was older so people would tell him he looks so young for his age.

Plus he could have retired earlier haha."
"People also generally lash out like that when they are feeling guilty. What if they're all in on it?

FIL casually partaking in his fetish, MIL asking for more, knowingly, as she used to be the one endulging him, son freaking out now, thinking they've been caught... 

Stranger things have happened, just saying. "
"Maybe he should have his sperm frozen for that ""What if.."" day and then get a vasectomy?

"Your boyfriend's survivalist fantasies sound lovely, and totally unrealistic.

The Pacific Northwest is a great area of the country to move to. Why don't you move to a *populated* area there just to see if you even like it. If your boyfriend is still living in his hometown, what kind of travel experience in the US has he had that he would even know whether his idea of living there is anything close to the reality of living there?

Why don't you try to just get jobs near Portland or Seattle or any other economically stable urban area and see how that works out for you?

Baby steps. There is a whole world of money your boyfriend needs to make to be able to afford anything close to ""thousands of acres of wooded land"" and a house on it. BTW -- most parts of the country you can find rural areas of less than 3,000 people in a town an hour's drive from a mid-sized city. You don't have to truly go to the middle of nowhere to escape people. Hell, just go to New Hampshire."
"Both at the same time. Her choice would be valid for her, but would take choice away from him and break his trust."
"What about Cavanaugh? It means ""son of Kevin,"" which still honors the original Kevin, as your little boy will be a son of his. 

You could also do Nevin, which sounds alike, but is unrelated. 

Many people also honor relatives with names inspired by a favorite hobby, month of birth, favorite animal, etc. 

I think the key compromise for your husband and you will be to choose your sons name in honor of his father, but perhaps not in the absolutely direct way your husband always imagined. 

If you are struggling, I would seek out help on the Nameberry forums (outside website) or r/namenerds. "
"They are still married, but are very jealous of each other and constantly accuse the other of cheating. And the husband is a notorious drunk driver. I do not associate with them anymore."

The only concerning thing I saw in the post was scrutinizing the receipts. I agree with you on the registry and the baby clothing.
Or that they're successful 
"&gt; I don't feel resentment towards him. Just her.

It's both of them. He's a momma's boy. He's 23. He's letting his mother be omnipresent in his life and relationship. My mom loves me to death but that constant contact just isn't a thing. They *both* are responsible for it, and letting your boyfriend off and just blaming her only is not going to fix the problem. "
Actually studies have shown that that behavior just builds the connection in your brain between anger and expressing physical aggression. It becomes Pavlovian. Your therapist may be a moron. 
"&gt; She waits, like a spider.

Holy shit...  That is a nasty thing to say.

She's a grieving mother.  You really think its more likely she's consumed with jealousy over a man she hasn't even attempted to contact in almost a decade than out of her head grieving her child?

"I don't know about this. I understand why people are suggesting it, but the check was from shortly before they started dating, meaning the hypothetical child was alive at that point. Its possible that someone would choose to start dating a month after their child died, but I find that a bit of a stretch. If the child died while they were dating, well, I understand it would be painful, but he also should have told OP and I also would think OP would notice something was up. I just don't think this is a likely explanation, though it's certainly possible."
"&gt; Did they expect Lara to be a grieving widow for the rest of her life? Widows are allowed to move on. You both loved Jack, but her life didn't end when his did.

I think it's more about me than Lara. They trusted me like a son and expected me to be like a brother to Lara since they don't know the history. They see this as a betrayal of Jack's trust. "
"My favorite part is where he says, ""it would destroy our family and *I don't want that*"". How selfish. "
"No you're not overreacting. Wait for all the similar comments to come in to this post and then show hubby what everyone thinks.

Justin is 19 and needs to learn that he's an adult and that if he can't act like one, then he's outta there.

Your husband needs to grow a backbone."
"Soccer fan here!  Go to the game, have a great time, and then make plans to do it again (and again) with her and your friends when she comes back in town and is able to go.  There will be so many more games this season that you can all go to.  Tell her to think of it as you scouting it out for when you take her."

I'm really sorry for your loss.
"What is wrong with you? You're complaining here about your wife not being communicative with you, but instead of communicating with her about it, you post anonymously on a public forum and call your sister?

**Talk. To. Your. Wife.**"
Certainly sounds like it. Did you tell your girlfriend the entire day? I bet you she'd be even more angry!
Tell your parents and have something done. That is disgusting and obviously so abusive to the animals - who knows what else he'll end up doing with them.
"Are they insured to be driving your car? People think this is no big deal until it is.  I have a friend that let someone barrow his car.  That fried hit someone and now he is stuck having to deal with a huge financial mess.  

As for dealing with your transportation issue the comment by /ivegotaqueso is good.  Since they were going to rent anyway, just rent a car for the time they are away and have them pay."
I asked the legal department at my counsel. They basically told me that anything less than murder is not a matter of concern. They were also surprised that I was paying for parking tickets.
"I don't understand, are you trying to make some kind of point?"
"Sounds like it's a turn on for her. I know my boyfriend personally gets turned on by that idea, but we don't want children yet. It may be similar.

However, if she knows it's upsetting you then her behavior is totally out of line. Since you've talked about children I'm assuming she knows you feel ready, which makes me uneasy about her behavior. I would sit her down and make sure she really knows how it makes you feel when she says that. If she continues after that, I'd strongly suggest therapy as it sounds like she doesn't respect you much if she continues doing something she knows hurts you."
You are a shining example of how to act in this situation. You reacted in the best possible way. Mega-kudos to you!!! =D
"&gt; You said you think it makes her more likely to cheat. Why do you think that?

Really. I've known people who had one or two partners in their life and cheated, versus people who have had many partners and have never cheated during a monogamous relationship. Lots of partners does not inherently make somebody a cheater--that's a whole other beast."
"You did fine. He behaved like a gentleman. You are fine. 

If you KEEP doing it, yeah, tease. But once was nerves and fine, just fine.

You'll be fine"
There isn't any therapist around who speaks our language. I haven't checked therapy over phone. I will do that.
"How long ago did he make the planters? How long have they been sitting there unused? If he went to great deal of trouble making them, they may have felt that you didn't really want them and when his mom did he just gave them to her.

The simple answer here is that he needs to apologize and stop lying, then make more planters for you.

"Going to be blunt... I have several dead friends and family members thanks to Heroin and Meth.

He won't get help with you and his family enabling him. What you have to look forward to is relapse after relapse, OD's, losing everything you own to dealers, possible Hep C, HIV, and heartbreak when he eventually dies or goes to prison. 

You are not going to be a special magic savior who helps him and lives happily ever after. You aren't. If you love him you'd get out now so he can focus on himself. He can not be in a relationship with anyone and get sober. It will not work.

You are young, live your life with out this trauma and pain and all the issues that come with it."
"She's trying to minimize why we took him to the vet that day, now she's saying he was just acting a little off but when we drove there she said ""he shouldn't be dying, he's too young."" So she knew then how sick he was. It's just weird how she has turned it around. "
"We have a fun show called ""Angry Carpenter"" in Sweden. The format is possibly common.

Anyway, the program is about people who have bought fixer-uppers, totally misjudged their time, will and ability to fix their house but still were thinking that ""next year I will do so much better"". The Angry Carpenter would come in and scold them for their delusions, help them a bit, and revise their plans to something more realistic. You wouldn't believe how many carefree, lazy people take several thousand hours of renovation work on themselves. Having their kids run around with exposed wiring, etc."
"I don't know why no one is mentioned this already, but I'm actually very proud of you for admitting all those things. I know it takes a lot to admit responsibility. Now to get into it in a different perspective, with your jealous feelings aside, you actually helped him more than you think. If it wasn't for you breaking up with him, he would've probably never got his shit together as a person. If you stayed with him, nothing would have changed and you would have resented him more down the road and break up or divorce, so you have to look at it at that angle. My ex did the same as you, broke up with me for those reasons, and honestly if she didn't, I don't think I would be on this great track that I'm on right now. 

I say this next part with honesty and respect, the difference between you and his fiancé is that his fiancé is willing to keep holding his hand to move up in life to where he wants to go, as where you (presumably) didn't. You expected all this from him and for him to do it on his own, which is not how a partnership works, and I'm sure you realize that now. His current fiancé takes care of him on that now, which is the exact situation I'm in right now too. 

Lastly, don't try getting back in his life. This guy just asked a woman to spend the rest of his life with him, and she said yes, you should just be happy for him and let it go, easier said than done, but there's my 2cents."
"Good lord, your husband is a horrible person. His brother is just as bad for going along with it. Clearly his parents wouldn't have been willingly complicit in his cheating at least; he lied to them for a reason. 
"
"&gt; Basically he told me if we used condoms I would have to allow him to do anal with no condom

You don't ""have"" to allow him anything. He's acting like an entitled brat. You said you don't want relationship advice (but since this is a relationship sub, I'll throw my 2 cents in anyway), but any guy who pressures you into going on birth control is a douche.

A lot of people double up on protection (birth control and condoms), but I'm guessing your boyfriend wanted you to go on bc so he wouldn't have to use condoms. Stop spoiling him.

Basically, it's your body and you chose to get the implant. Nobody put a gun to your head and forced you. You knew you had issues with bc and you still chose to use it. That's on you.

However, you can still ask your boyfriend to help you with the bill. If he's a good person (which he's not, given that he sounds like a selfish entitled brat), he should take responsibility for the cost of bc."
"Jesus Reddit, why so douchey today? 

Anyways, look, you probably should have explained back yonder when he first brought it up that you had tried it in college and didn't like it, that might have made this less of a deal. It was probably a hell of a shock to hear it so vulgarly put whilst everyone else was drunk. I would hate to find something out that way as well and I understand the probable internal monologue that is going through his head (Well, Jane used to do this in college, why won't she do it with me? What's so off-putting about me? etc. Doesn't make it right, but I've been there)

HOWEVER, no one has to perform any sexual act that they're not comfortable with whether or not that had done it previously. He's not entitled to your ass just because John and Jack played with it in college. Also, if ass play was THIS big of a deal to him he probably should have made that clear in your first discussion. I think both parties handled it incorrectly and the only way to fix this is to, ya know, *talk* to your fiancé ffs."
If you really did make it clear being friends was all you were interested in then she is acting crazy. Block her and move on. If you just hinted or implied it you probably did lead her on some. Apologize  for that and then block her and move on. 
"I think the number one problem here is that OP based way too much on ""assumptions"".

He assumed Zelda was one way because of how he perceived her ""presentation"", so he assumed she wasn't dating anyone else. And he assumed his putting her on hold for weeks was somehow a clear way to communicate his dating philosophies."
"I see where you're coming from. And I think what you're saying makes sense for this situation. 

However, the continuous outreach to parents everytime there's a bumpy moment in the relationship isn't a habit OP should continue. 

Eventually he will leave this demon and seek a healthy relationship. If he does this with that good person, he will damage the relationship. 

It's at the very least worth it for OP to know what he risks when he does that in the future. "

"I agree with this. 

I clicked on this thread expecting to read about a wife with unreasonable jealousy issues. But it seems like OP has poor tastes in friends and has clouded judgment in communication. "
....did I not point that out? 
u/wapitimagnet apparently believes that people are always 100% logical computers.
Especially about their daughter. No matter how open you are about joking about sexual stuff nobody wants to think about that in relation to their daughter

Because cheating for many people is a dealbreaker."
"Don't move in with him, and don't give up the cat.

If it was just about the cat, that would be my only advice. But it's not just about the cat. He's arguing with you about this and calling you ""irrational"" and ""emotional"" and those are red flags. he is not a good boyfriend. He's acting like a jerk and I am actually glad for you that he is doing this before you have moved in together, which saves you from a lot of trouble and heartache. "
Wow the thought of this makes me so angry... Some people really suck.
"If your family thinks a man's height is more important than his character &amp; how he treats you, their values are warped. By all means, move closer to his not-warped family.

"Vets actually have a very high suicide rate. It's an incredibly tough, heart-wrenching job. I'm so grateful for that profession."
"&gt;As time has gone on however, its been really difficult to remain okay with the whole situation because she barely texts me, essentially meaning that we're barely friends. As a result, I've been getting increasingly clingy, texting her a few times a day asking her whats going on without reply.

Dude, you need to stop. It's not like she's on a beach vacation, she's at a special home getting help for her mental health issues. I understand and empathize that you care about her and want to hear from her, but she asked for space and you're giving her none. That's a surefire way to guarantee she won't be your girlfriend when she comes home. 

Maybe instead you can write her some letters whenever you feel the need to get your feelings out. Don't send every one you write, but maybe once a fortnight send one off. It's a sweet way to prove that you're still thinking of her without spamming her with texts she doesn't want."
"Maybe that's not what you meant, but it is clearly true.

Your husband does not respect you."
Yup. I was that trial goy.
