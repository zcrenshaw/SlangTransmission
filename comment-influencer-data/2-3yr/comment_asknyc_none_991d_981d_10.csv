"From the thread the bot linked, this great post by /u/ncninetynine

&gt;Here are my personal tips if you absolutely “bucket list” want to see the ball drop in Times Square with a million of your closest friends. Note: I have no experience with the restaurants in Time Square viewing party deals, this is for if you want to stand on the street with the crowd.

&gt;First: Look the day before for the entrances via the NYPD. They only open certain cross streets for pedestrians who want to enter the square and after a certain time will completely block off the streets as they fill up. I.e. if you want to enter on 44th but the 44th pen is already full they will shut down the 44th street entrance and make you walk up to the 54th street one. However, they funnel you into the pen affiliated with the street so I would start at the bottom and work my way uptown for the best view.

&gt;Second: you will be funneled into pens. They do this for both security and crowd control. Find the Pen entrance, (you will see cops etc.) go through security and then that is your section for the night. NOTE: If you are in the first few pens, i.e. below 49th street, you cannot leave the pen and re-enter until after midnight.

&gt;Third: What time you need to get there depends on how close you want to be to the action. Want to touch the performers? Get there at 10am. Want to be on TV? Get there before 2pm. Want to see the ball, I would guess anywhere from 3- to maybe 5pm (I got there at 3:30pm and were at 49th street- we could see the ball but only hear the performances and we also didn’t get any of the free swag you see on tv).

&gt;Third: let’s talk bathrooms. After they shut down all the entrances into the Time Square area (i.e. no car or pedestrian traffic without a pre-given ticket after 7pm) the pens that were too far to be on TV (think past 49th street) had more relaxed police. We were allowed to get out of the pen and come back in, go to the bathroom at the local businesses and get food there. You were kind of stuck on that block, 49th to 50th, because you weren’t allowed to wander out of that area.

&gt;Fourth: Bags. You aren’t allowed to bring bags, blankets, big coolers etc. pretty much anything but yourself and your coat. How did we get around that? We stuffed food/water bottle/snacks and one of those drawstring bags folded up into our pockets. Then once we got inside we took off our extra layers and the stuff in our pockets we put in the drawstring. However, this was pre- Chelsea bomb in NYC so you may just want to keep everything in your pocket or bring a clear ziplock to put it in if you’re going to want to put it on the ground.

&gt;Fifth: The weather. When you are standing on the street for 7+ hours you’re completely exposed to the elements. The crowds helped a little with the warmth, especially at the start but after that it got cold, fast. I would recommend wearing a TON of layers and then taking them off when you get there and slowly putting them back on. It is going to be cold so PLEASE dress appropriately.

&gt;Sixth: Drinking. While you could probably sneak in a flask most people weren’t drinking. I think it was the combo of the cold and the lack of restrooms didn’t really make it that kind of atmosphere. If you want to get drunk I would go to a bar instead.

&gt;Seventh: Leaving. Pretty much right after midnight it was a mad rush to get out of the area and the crowds for the subway were HUGE and I can’t imagine there were many cabs available. I would recommend just walking to wherever you’re going next.

&gt;Overall, it was quite the experience. Was it fun? Yes, but it also was a REALLY long night to get to 15-20 minutes of celebration. (I honestly don’t think I will ever go again) I would recommend it only if you are totally willing to put up with the craziness, don’t mind large crowds, and have someone to go with who can make 12 hours seem to fly by. Anyways sorry for the novel but this was all info I wanted before I went and couldn’t find anywhere online.


Show your mom this post and see if she still wants to do it. I definitely recommend the Grand Army Plaza or Central Park fireworks over this. "
May God have mercy on OP's soul.
"It seems a little nuts to go through the process of checking into a different hotel each day just to be able to walk everywhere. I think it makes a lot more sense to pick a centrally located hotel, like around Herald Square. On each day you could head out in a different direction and then come back at the end of the day. If you feel it would be too repetitive to walk back, you could take the subway back. 

This way you still get to see the city on foot but without spending time checking into new hotels and the hassle of carrying everything around with you each day. You can easily walk pretty much anywhere within a day in Manhattan (depending on which attractions you want to see along the way). The only real downside is that returning to the hotel would probably mean taking a subway in order to maximize how far away from the hotel you can walk. Although I'm not even sure this counts as a downside since it seems like the purpose is to explore on foot, not so much an aversion to public transit.

Alternatively, it's perfectly possible to just use the subway normally and head to a particular neighborhood or set of neighborhoods and walk around all day."

"Seconding /u/DC25NYC that Buffalo and Albany would not be my top recommendations for exploring upstate NY.  

Saratoga Springs is one of my favorites, it's where I went to college and have spent plenty of time since.  Beautiful Victorian architecture, a surprisingly great nightlife and restaurant scene, the racetrack when it's in season is a blast (but lodging is tough to come by during track season), beautiful parks and so on.  

Saratoga is sort of the gateway to the Adirondacks and exploring Lake George would certainly give you some culture shock.  It's like going back in time 40 years.  Small, quaint, endearingly cheesy.  Saranac Lake is beautiful, Schroon Lake is supposed to be beautiful, Lake Placid, Brant Lake, Warrensburg, Bolton's Landing, Ticonderoga--these are all very remote, wilderness towns that will feel a world away from the city.  There's lots of summer camps, summer retreats, camping, hiking, fishing and hunting up there.  It's pristine forest in the country's largest public protected park.  Treat hiking up there with respect, it is not Disneyworld and you do not want to get lost.

The Catskills to me have either a backwoods hillbilly kind of vibe (looking at you, Downsville) or a really yuppie Brooklyney vibe (Woodstock, Saugerties, Kingston).

The Brooklyney vibe continues across the river in the mid Hudson valley near Annandale on Hudson, the town of Hudson, Red Hook, Tivoli, Rhinebeck and so on.  Beautiful bed and breakfasts, Williamsburg-to-Bushwick style restaurants and scene, set in farmland.  It's very nice but I wouldn't call it authentic upstate.  There's a lot of direct cultural influence from the city. There is still some real farmland in areas off the Taconic like Taghkanic, Millerton, and Valatie.

The Finger Lakes region in Central NY is really charming and does not have a touristy, spoiled by NYCers vibe.  The town of Skaneateles is beautiful and there's great wine, cheese and beer tours up in that area.  Ithaca is among the Finger Lakes as well.  Watkins Glen has the famous waterfalls. The surrounding area along Rt 81 is real farmland, lots of dairies, and a beautiful drive.  Cortland has a big SUNY school but is nestled in a pretty damn rural area and Homer, Cazenovia, Chittenango, Manlius, Pompey and so on are all tiny little towns nestled among farms.  I adore them all, I really love this area.  Winter is no fucking joke though.  This is the heart of the snow belt.  The big city in the area is Syracuse, which is pretty urban and I understand copes with a fair amount of blight and poverty.  

Rochester and westward is all Greek to me, I've never spent much time out there.  I know Elmira is one of the sadder places I've ever been just from the desperate poverty that you seem to pick up on right away. Maybe I caught it at a bad time.  Parts of Schenectady are also some of the rougher, sadder places I've ever been.  When heavy industry left upstate, it left hard, and destitution looks different in deep Brooklyn or the Bronx than it does in a place like that where there's no Upper West Side or Chelsea to contribute to the public coffers.  

Parts of Orange County that have not become NYC exurbs are still interesting commercial farmland.  For example the black dirt region is the capital of onion growing in NY state.  The whole town of Pine Island is onion themed because of it.  They mostly grow crops up there (corn, pumpkin, garlic, onion) rather than raise dairy cattle like they do in CNY.   The town of Warwick is cute but ""city"" by my standards.  Chester, Florida, Goshen, Pine Bush and parts of Middletown are more rural.

Millbrook, Dover Plains, Amenia are all hardcore horse country.  Tons of horse farms out that way. Very pastoral and beautiful but expensive as wealthy NYCers buy up the old estates and use them as weekend homes.  Pricey antique shopping but still pretty.

Lastly there are some spots that are just a pain in the ass to get to from the city that I think are pretty well sheltered from the NYC influence--that's areas like Oneonta, Cooperstown, that whole area around Utica.  I haven't been up there in a while but other than half moon cookies, there's fucking nothing up there.

"The lifestyle is not very different from anything you would have seen in PA and NJ. 

You need a car for almost everything. You will see lots and lots of space. You'll see little or no traffic. You'll see vast expanses of natural scenery (lakes, hills, forests, etc). People are more relaxed. If you go to some of the smaller upstate towns, you'll see dead Main Streets and lots of evidence of ""has-been"" towns.

I wouldn't say anything is a culture shock, it's just different from NYC, but very similar to the rest of suburban life in the northeast. "

I also wave to the guys in the bagel place, the pizza shop, and the hippie food store at least once a day, and talk to the guy who lives in the park about once a week to make sure he's ok and listen to his great stories about being stationed overseas."

"Hey, so, I've actually done several all-day walks through NYC and can offer plenty of tips. Great trip idea. 

First off, aside from snacks and water you won't really need to carry much of anything. Different hotel each night is a great idea but will be stupid and useless in execution. Just get a place near a big transit stop and return there each night. Our public transit is great for this and any spot in Manhattan can be reached from any other spot in a night or less, while not carrying your clothes will open up a lot of opportunities for you. 

If you are in good walking shape you can reasonably do the length of Manhattan in an entire day. It's not ideal for tourism though, so here's what I recommend: 

1) Upper Manhattan hike. Go up to the 207th street stop and walk down to 125th street. On the way down hit the major parks in Inwood and Fort Tryon, check out cultural events in Washington Heights, hit up the Hamilton House, and finish up with soul food in Harlem. If you walk this section fast enough you can probably work in part of Central Park and either a bit of Museum mile or the upper west. Going with the walking theme I'd recommend the Guggenheim, since it's so vertical. 

2) General exploration below 20th. Have an exploration day in the east and west village, Fidi, plus Chinatown and the surrounding area. Plan to end in Chinatown so you can pig out on soup dumplings. This area doesn't conform to the grid so you can just put away plans and explore. 

3) Brooklyn. Give yourself a Brooklyn day and explore prospect park, Williamsburg, all that fun stuff. Walk over the Brooklyn or Manhattan bridge in the morning and then take the subway home. 

4) Tourist day. Central Park, Midtown, Union Square. 

Lemme know if you have any specific questions, I've done full-day walks all over the city. 

Edit to add: what you are able to do also depends on time of year. If you're doing this in summer you are basically fine - you will be worn out by nighttime anyway. In winter the sun goes down by 4-5 though. For safety purposes just make sure you finish the day in a high-traffic area - anywhere in Core Manhattan (avoid Spanish Harlem, FiDi - not because it's unsafe, just because it's empty - and maybe the projects area of Alphabet City) and the well-known parts of Brooklyn should be safe. As long as you're somewhere with a decent amount of foot traffic and lighting you're okay. Avoid parks and industrial areas at night. Someplace like Times Square, Williamsburg, etc is ideal for nighttime. "

Properly drafted [prenuptial agreements](http://www.nycbar.org/get-legal-help/article/family-law/marital-agreements/prenuptial-agreements/) are absolutely enforceable in court. However, the opposing party could always dispute it. If you did your due diligence when it was drafted, there should be little reason to worry about it.

Also, if you're this worried about your assets and think divorce is that likely, don't bother getting married."
