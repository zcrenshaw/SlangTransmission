"Everyone in politics is ""bought and paid for"". Literally 100%. Stop acting like its just the right. What a pleb. "
"I don't know. I never claimed in now the answer, i just know the problem: when justice is about who does better job and not about what actually happened, it is not about justice but about winning. It allows large corporations to treat people like crap. You know it too. Doesn't take a genius to know that if the defendants wearing glasses is a factor, something is seriously wrong. Or when technicalities are accepted.

I know it will never be perfect but adding more justice to judicial system is not #1 priority on anyone practicing in law. No one in the system has any motivation to improve it, besides academy. Which is why i do have a slight disdain for lawyers but i understand that i would probably do exactly the same in that situation.. But i can not hold the society to the low standards i reserve for myself, this place would like crap if everyone would be like me ;)

If defense lawyer learns during the case that his client is 100% certain the guilty part, they must excuse themselves. I don't think that kind of thing should be allowed to exist and that it should not be a matter of conscience. Would it work without destroying some other right that is even more important? Like the right to fair trial? Maybe not but something should be done if person knows their client has done it, there should be something that could be done, instead of ""i have to shut up and use all the tricks in th book to give this bastard a free pass"". Those lawyers exist. I believe that majority of lawyers are not like that or may have temporary moral memory loss due to money...

"I've posted this before but its up there as one of the worst I did...
I worked on a croissant line. You can bet they never came out of the machine with that nice curved shape. Nope - they are straight, but someone has to bend them into shape, thousands of them every day, on a moving line. This equates to the most depressing job in the world. TLDR - I bent croissants for a living
Edit: I'm humbled by everyone's interest and concern. I shed the croissant shackles a long time ago. I guess it's one of those jobs you have to do to make you what you are today..."

"Do you even understand how illegal immigrants vote? Or how people illegally vote at all for that matter?

I'll give you a hint. They don't walk up to the ballot box and check a box that says [I can't legally do this].

Here's an example. My girlfriend was too busy to vote so she got a mail in ballot. I however actually had time to go to a station. The morning before I went she asked me to fill out her ballot and drop it off for her, which is legal.

I *could* have written in anything I wanted. She wanted to vote for Hillary and if I was a fucking criminal I could have just not filled in that bubble. And this stupid ass investigation would never have known the fucking difference.

And I'm not the only person in this situation. There are hundred of thousands of people who mailed their ballots in. And there is literally no way to prove that the people who received those ballots are the same people that filled them out.

How does treating a fucking cat have anything to do with her parenting? You people and cats... makes me sick you basically value them as much as a human life.
Yes. Female rape victims are always belived.
No it is not. Not for 90% or more of music majors. Kids are expensive as shit.
"Hahaahaahabahaha I'm not uninformed, your argument is just shit. She married a president. She jumped into a senate seat she shouldn't have been eligible for. She became secretary of state, then used the position solely for her own benefit. What other ""qualifications"" does she have again?"

"Have you seen the actual statement? No? That's probably because he literally did not criticise people who suffer from PTSD.

Here is what he actually said:

&gt;When you talk about the mental health problems, when people come back from war and combat and they see things that maybe a lot of the folks in this room have seen many times over and you‚Äôre strong and you can handle it. But a lot of people can‚Äôt handle it. And they see horror stories. They see events that you couldn‚Äôt see in a movie, nobody would believe it.

He literally didn't say that PTSD sufferers are too weak for service. You completely made that up to make him look bad.  "

"I tried to like it, but the premise of musicality in the movie was such utter trash that I couldn't. Everything about it regarding musicianship and learning was fucking terrible. 

They took a football movie formula and tried to superimpose it onto musical culture - lo and behold it was just bad. 

The kid practices like a fucking contact hockey player, bleeding, the teacher teaches like a rough football coach, and never is there any culturing or nouturing of creativity or musicality in the movie. 

Also, to add insult to injury, fucking Buddy Rich? A white dude, for a movie supposedly about jazz? The era of jazz back then was Black, and picking a white dude as a representative of that was just ridiculous. "

"It's a growing voterbase, because as mills get older, they get real jobs and mortgages and all of the sudden TAXES become a real concept to them; not just a free handout.  

These systems don't pay for themselves. ""Tuition Free"" isn't free at all, taxes pay for them, people already saddled with student debt pay for them, and as we can see when everyone goes to college, you have colleges letting every tom-dick-and-harry in and bringing down their quality of education. And  by the way, CCs are free to the poor through grants and middle class can easily afford them. This is a non-issue. If you can't find a way to get free or affordable higher education, you're at fault. The system is fine.  Not everyone needs a bachelors in art interpretation. 

And K12 doesn't work either. Look at any urban school and the massive drop out rates they have. Look at fucking Oregon, which prides itself on being this enlightened liberal utopia. they have one of the lowerst graduation rates in the nation. 

And if I get laid off, I get this little thing that *I* pad into with my own wages called unemployment insurance. If I didn't see the storm coming and didn't get trained in a new field, that's my own problem, not yours. In fact, I did see the wave coming 5 years ago, and that's why I have the job I have now. "

"They're not.

There are different styles of pants. And some do have small pockets or none at all. Other do have decent or big sized pockets.

It's all about what you buy. Check the pocket size before you buy and even if it's a fabulous pair of pants, don't buy them if they have tiny pockets. Or do, but then don't complain about ALL women's pants not having pockets. Because that's just a big fat lie.

Edit: if you can't find pants with decent pockets then I've got news for you: you suck at shopping."
