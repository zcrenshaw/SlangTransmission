Their hatred for Hillary or Liberals is stronger than their desire for a qualified President. 
"Well, I just realised the title says 16. Correct that to 17. "
"I told myself during the Republican Party debates that I would never vote for him. What specifically happened now that made me open up my eyes were the tweets. The immaturity behind them. I'm fearful to have someone so immature running our county. The ""I won I'm the best blah blah blah"" mentality is terrifying. The tweets about Hillary and Meryl Streep specifically. Then I thought about all the things he did during the elections and I am disappointed in myself for overlooking certain things. For instance the mocking of the disabled reporter or his lack of diplomacy during all debates. I knew it was happening but ignored it. "
Chicken butt. 
"Honestly, his political views are *still* worse than his antics. 

Let that soak in, like a delicious soy marinade on some firm, pressed tofu. "
They grow up so fast 
"My man, Trump is a multimillionaire elite.  Please."
Happy Birthday!!!
In one sitting? 
"Out of curiosity, what took you so long to open your eyes? You had 18 months of formal campaign and several decades before that to get an impression of him. How could it possibly have taken this long to register what sort of person he is?"
"Oh, please. As a resident of Texas. I can tell you that many people (probably a majority) think that Obamacare and the ACA are different programs. 

Our primary problem isn't Trump, it's the stunningly dumb people."
"You should become a detective. The more info you gathered in a case, the more you'd be able to remember details of every interview and case file and string things together. You'd be like Monk: ""she just said she'd been inside that day, but I remember that her footprints were wet from dew."""
I tried to look more at the actual political views and less about his actions. But now looking back his actions were too terrible for me to overlook. I feel ashamed to have voted for someone like that. I agreed with certain beliefs but not enough to accept how he behaved. 
"Why did none of his antics prior to Election Day change your mind? 

I can give specifics if need be but generally the racist, sexist, bullying behavior."
"no questions, just want to say congratulations!"
"Excuse me sir, but do you have any weed? "
"Ah, yes, Trump corruption is *much* better - it's sanctioned by the Republican Party. And the Kremlin."
"The main thing is we won't close, if Waffle House closes you need to run away very quickly. Most other businesses and restaurants will close for a winter storm. If your power goes out, or you didn't get supplies for a milk sandwich, we have you covered"
"Is there any Darkweb news- I'm talking things they don't want people to see- and if so, how credible?

I would imagine News stuff on there could probably just be all fake/fringe stuff but maybe there are genuine things like videos you can have as proof. "
"""I'm not gay, but $20 is $20"""

"That's funny that you say that...we actually always joke about how she's just my old buddy's sister! 
 
Here's what she says about her sexuality as a boy: ""I was never into boys or anything. And all my attraction to girls came completely from my jealousy of them because they were female and I wasn't. I guess I just never found my sexuality until I transitioned."" 
She actually had a girlfriend for a year in high school."
"Maybe when we're old and have time we'll write a book together ;) 

I never had a good relationship with my family, and my relationship with my wife was kind of a ""straw that role the camel's back"" type thing. We rarely talk anymore. But I'm starting my own family now that will be much more open and loving"
I was working on a college project that I need to send this afternoon. I don't have time to report today. If it sounds a bit surrealistic it's because it is
ðŸ˜‚ thanks for the suggestion. I want to go into Law and eventually politics. 
"From a non-American, this sounds about right."
"if they're of the opposite sex (or.... you know what I mean), you should tell your family you're inviting your significant other for dinner and watch the hilarity unfold.

....or not. but maybe! :)"
"I sure do, but I keep it to myself and smoke it at home. Maybe if we become buddies we can blaze it someday!"
"This is the worst AMA with very convoluted misguided information. OP doesn't mention to not even download TOR without connecting to a proxy first. 

OP also doesn't mention that all this is still extremely risky and that customs seizes packages on a regular basis, and depending on what's inside and the volume ordered. You'll either get a pink slip or an undercover postal inspector at your door ready to arrest you after you sign off on the package. 

Yes, currently this is the safest way to purchase drugs, real drugs that won't cause you extreme negative side effects or just be outright fake. There's a certain level of ""checks and balance"" in place due to the review systems in place on the good markets. 

As of right now all of Europe, with Germany leading the charge, is cracking down on the dark web hardcore after a gun wielding lunatic went on a rampage with a weapon allegedly purchased from the dark web. 

Where you will have a 99% chance of being apprehended on the dark web, regardless of security measures taken, is if you so decide to purchase a weapon. 

Purchases of drugs, sent to another address, in quantities of one ounce or less, are not risky and have a 99% chance of success domestic, and about a 90% chance international if done correctly. 


There are plenty of in depth and informative guides to the dark web online that will teach you to even remotely access it off your phone off a public wifi network somewhere random... 

Don't do this with the computer you love and cherish. 
Don't download Tor without connecting to a proxy first. 
Don't go buy bitcoin with a credit card and spend it on these dark web markets. There's a cash alternative to this called LOCALBTC. Find a dealer near you, pay cash for your coin, tumble the coin and then, and only then would I suggest spending it. 

The point here isn't to evade law enforcement. 

The NSA have quantum computers. They laugh at TOR encryption.

The NSA can destroy anything you've seen in terms of encryption in a matter of seconds. 
This is a branch of government with unlimited resources, in the most powerful country on the planet.
These are the guys who are actively monitoring terrorist communications. 

They know who you are. They know what you are doing. 

The only measurements you can take to protect yourself only goes to the extent of making their job more difficult and costly and time consuming. 

This makes you a lesser priority target, then say the major dealer who doesn't use any encryption. 

You, being a small time user, using high levels of encryption and data protection, are going to cause the NSA major budget/time efficiency issues and they will not bother targeting you. 

Customs will target you for anything they find. 

I advise doing heavy heavy research on a public wifi network somewhere on this before attempting to do it. 

Shipping something illegal over multiple state and international borders, carries something like life in prison or close to it in the USA. 

We here in the US also love to spend tax money punishing the shit out of drug users. 
Like, murder and using drugs are equivalent here. 

Lol. 

Just a very very sad pathetic excuse for a country, 
Yet it's the most fair most just country on planet earth. 

Yep, the rest of the earth sucks that much harder. 

This stuff, in my opinion should be an adults decision to use privately. 
The government doesn't belong in your own decisions about your own health, well being, family, or anything for that matter. 

"
"Actually no I didn't. I wanted to feel like a normal kid, so I just laughed like my friends, but I did take a bunch of precautions. I would wear black pants/shorts, bring an extra change of clothes in my backpack to school, etc.

I will say though that whenever I laughed, 100 percent of the time I would catch myself laughing and think ""ok I'm laughing, be careful"". My laughs were NEVER care-free. If I started to wet myself, I would try as hard as I could to stop laughing. But once I started laughing, most of the time the damage was done and I couldn't stop my bladder from emptying completely. Fucking sucked!"
"Yes. That's the worst part. Since I remember things in vivid details. And since my memory is Autobiographical, I tend to feel the exact same emotions I did when I went through before while recalling. 
So basically, I can't forgive people because the hurt never goes away. That's the worst part. Even if they apologize and make up for their mistakes, memories come fleeting to me with the same feelings. So the intensity of any emotion never dies down. 
Same with happy feelings. 
But I can keep going back revaluate situations as my current emotions never influence my memory. I remember things for exactly what they were. 
I never experience nostalgia for things I've to let go and don't like. Makes me decisive as fuck. "
You would be a scary politician 
Haha no! Fortunately I FUCKPISSSHITCUNTFUCKYOURMOTHER don't just cuss randomPISSINGSHITALLOVERly all the time lol
Just looking with open eyes. I still agree with most of his political stances but his behavior is just too extreme. 
[deleted]
Why are you regretting it now? What specifically happened?
"A LOT MORE. People tend to have the same conversations over and over again without realizing. Especially if they're at the same place . And they get a feeling of deja vu. But I know for sure that it has happened before. 
It so happens that people are more likely to talk and think about the same things when they visit the same places. And since they don't remember previous repetitions they get a sense of deja vu. I don't. 
Secondly. If I ever watch a place on TV or in a photo. My brain involuntarily remembers that too. I don't even focus on the background but the time I visit the same place that's when I actually get a sense of deja vu. So then I have to scramble through my head to find out which picture I'd seen. I can pinpoint all times. "
"Not asking a question, I just love Waffle House!"
Why did you do an AMA if you arent gonna respond to any questions anyway? 
Good chance it's fake.  Alternatively there is at least one dumb person out there of many- everyone knew.
"Yikes  :(  I hope you're feeling better soon!  Also, why not report it right away?"
Next time hit them with a bottle first! 
"ðŸ˜‚ not if no one knows of my powers. 
Muahahahaha"
"When I was in 8th grade I had a surgical procedure where they injected botox into my bladder to paralyze the bladder muscle so it doesn't contract as often (I was put under so I didn't feel anything)

Usually the procedure is supposed to be repeated every 6 months to a year, but it worked so well the first time I only had to repeat it once! To be honest I still get the occasional wetting, but it's only when I haven't gone to the bathroom in a long time and then I laugh really hard. "
I will dropkick a motherfucking 14 year old if they pose a threat.

"&gt;Just out of my own personal interest, why are you so fucking stupid? 

Nice, man. You showed her. "
Nope! They ran as soon as I started bleeding. Next time I'm probably letting them take it though.
"How do you feel about the whole thing? 

As someone a bit older, let me just give you one advise: Don't feel betrayed or lied to! It's never easy to give up a child for adoption and you don't know which state your mother was in, when this happened and what the circumstances were. Stuff like this is generally well know by the people who were around at the time (would be difficult to hide a pregnancy anyway), but not mentioned to the younger ones, who weren't around at the time. People have secrets and your mum wasn't always your mum, but simply a young girl with problems and a life you probably cannot imagine right now. Most kids see their parents just as their parents and not as actual humans with problems, desires, wishes and a past. So, while its completely normal to feel confused and betrayed, you shouldn't be and you would have been told when you are older. I wish you all the best!"
"Holy shit dude. California would be a gold mine for you. It's like this state is 5 steps ahead of all other economies at the top. 300/hour to get ur junk sucked by a sub. 

Lmao. "
"Yeah. All of them. If I remember them in the morning. I remember them forever. 
If I wake up in the morning and not remember, which only happens due to severe exhaustion, or meds. Then I don't. Also I can feel 'feel' time. To a discrepancy of a minute. I know what time it is all the time or how long has it been exactly.  I can also read in my dreams. People can't. It's because I remember letters and numbers very clearly.
People can't read in dreams because their actual memories of numbers are hazy so when they see them in dreams. They're hazy. 
"
Do you remember your dreams?
"My father worked with Donald Trump for his hotel in hospitality procurement. Donald Trump refused to pay him because he 'wasn't happy with their services' and kept stalling to pay. He also tried shifting the price.

Donald Trump is not someone you want to do business with if you want to get paid."
"It was a mountain biking accident. On a trail I'd ridden hundreds of times. I have no memory of the actual crash though. My recovery is due in large part to amazing parents, friends and therapists, and lots of time in a swimming pool. I also had two amazing surgeons who performed a grueling 12 hour operation. My spinal cord was just bruised, nothing severed, thankfully. "
"Since when is free speech a bad thing?

Oh yeah, when it is anti trump. It is okay when he calls over half of the people he would ""lead"" losers and other unkind and defamatory words. "
Is your left testicle still your left testicle or is it just ***the testicle***?
"I'm sorry if this is rude to ask. How well was the surgery? Can you see your childhood friend in her or is it like being with your buddies sister kind of thing? Also, did she always find you attractive even as a kid?"
hey that's rude :(
What is your next endeavor?
"ðŸ˜‚ maybe. Maybe not. 

See. From what I've noticed. Deja Vu can be debunked 9/10 times. 
Also. If people with my condition are assholes like me, they'd just deliberately repeat events or subtle physical actions in front of people in similar places to weird them out. 

Oh. How fun that is."
Yes yes we do hahahaha
FUCKING. HILARIOUS. I honestly love the jokes and the way that television makes it out to be haha
What's changed your opinion? 
How do you think they got to be millionaires?
"If getting paid two-hundred dollars to draw pokemon porn is evil, then I'm not sure I wanna be good B)"
But Trump is a bully and makes fun of everyone. Do we want the world to see this? Do we want out children to imitate it?
"I call Bullshit unless I get some proof. This should be on r/IAmA if it's legit which from op's profile I doubt it is.

r/ama doesn't require real proof so he could (and probably is) making this shit up. 

Edit: I think I found proof enough that op is trolling

 &gt;Then God pulls down his pants and does a big poo, afterwards everyone cleans the poo and finds 2007scape underneath

He said that four weeks ago. I think op is around 14 and discovered the ""porn star"" tab on pornhub.

"Can't ask a thing, actually. I have Neurofibromatosis Type 2 and I was near that point in 2003. I came back, walking with a cane.

So why am I commenting? To congratulate you, shake your hand, slap your back and tell you ""Good job!"""
$50 an hour? That's it?
They reached out to me and that's actually how I found out about them. They had known about me their whole life and thought that I knew about them. 
"No worries, I don't expect everyone to know what it is! Also, sorry for the late response, I thought I had stopped getting responses a while ago and disappeared from the internet for a bit.

Marfan's (or other people just call it Marfan) Syndrome is a connective tissue disorder that usually affects the heart, eyes, and skeleton.  We're usually super tall (I'm not as tall as many others, but I'm 6 feet tall as a girl), have longer wingspans than we are tall, have horrible eyesight, and have heart conditions.

I personally have Mitral Valve Prolapse and they also monitor my aorta heavily because that is a huge Marfan's risk factor.  The lenses in my eyes are dislocated and I have EXTREME nearsightedness (without glasses or contacts I can't see something clearly unless it is about 1cm from my eye). My joints have also always been super creaky and achy but nothing too extreme.

"""Tell me a bit about yourself.""
""I'm 16, living in Australia, and trying to get as much writing experience as possible."" 
""Ah, excellent. When can you start?""
""Hold up, sorry, I meant 17."" 
""We're going to have to let you go.""

To answer your question though, the stuff I charge $80-$100 for are one-time things and always, naturally, get proofread after submission. They can be edited after publication, too, as they are online articles such as on History Lists or mentalfloss' website. 

The contracts have never been more than an average $15 a piece - the staff/employers aren't rich snobs, they're more laid back, and expect to receive mistakes, even if it's just a wrong keystroke. 

Also, I review a piece a lot more than a Reddit title - though I did read through the text post itself a couple times, I didn't reread the title. "

"I think its safe to say that Trump didn't win, as much as Clinton lost.  She couldn't have won an open primary, and didn't.  I don't think Trump could have beat anyone else.  Both Biden and Sanders would have won.   Hopefully there's a lesson, for both parties, in that."
