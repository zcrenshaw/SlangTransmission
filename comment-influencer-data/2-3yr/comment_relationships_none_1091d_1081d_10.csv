"Good Lord, wtf is wrong with these women who raised is?"
"It's happened before unfortunately, I will usually ask for space or just point out that it isn't a good time to get into things - and she will demand that we have to talk right then regardless of the situation. I end up worried that whatever argument we get into has to be discussed and resolved immediately on her time, and I am not permitted to have any lingering feelings about it. Of course, immediate discussion tends to destroy whatever activity or social situation we were involved in. Worst one that comes to mind was a music festival months ago - she thought I wasn't having a good time with her, so she proceeded to begin yelling at me while trying to get water. All because I was uncomfortable in the crowd (so crowded, couldn't even move) and asked if we could back up some.

In that section I meant that I fell asleep while she was in the shower, but I was so tired that I barely remember her attempts to wake me up. It was not a dream, I do remember when she pushed me and made a mean comment, I fell right back asleep after. The timetable made no sense, I mean it had to be 12:30am when she took a shower, and when I was woken up it was around 3am. She insisted she had just gotten back from the shower, but I think she spent two hours alternating between trying to wake me up and crying, before finally getting to the point of yelling which did get me out of bed. That would match up with her telling me yesterday that she couldn't sleep and stared at the ceiling because she was so upset.

Maybe it is a mismatch. I feel like when she isn't getting upset I am more carefree about my actions and with less anxiety, I flirt more with her. But when I'm worried about the next issue, being flirtatious is not on my mind when I'm just trying to keep the peace."
"Ideally, she wouldn't find out"
"Talk to your church about avenues available outside their direct purview.  Are you Catholic?  Catholic Charities has a wide network of causes and they can absolutely find something for her to do.  I'd recommend something out of her comfort zone.  Nothing in a cushy little office where she can hide.  Put her in contact where she is going to have to interact with and help minorities.  Soup kitchens, homeless outreach, literacy programs.

It's easy to sit behind a computer screen and be hateful because people aren't ""real"" at that point.  She needs to talk to those less advantaged from her to make it real, because for some reason she seems to lake real empathy."
Good point. Maybe do it all on speakerphone but tape the two of them to chairs so they have to listen to her. Give them a taste of what it's like to be helpless.
"This absolutely needs to be done.

However, while restricting her home internet access will stop her from posting further videos in the short term, it doesn't deal with the underlying cause; ie helping her to realise that she's mistaken and very wrong in her beliefs. In fact, restricting her freedoms in this way may, conversely, encourage her to double down on her beliefs, even if she gets better at hiding her views in the short term. Furthermore, if she's getting validation for these views from things that OP has less control over (school friends for instance), then she'll get encouragement for fighting agains OPs measures.

If OP wants her to be a better person -not just someone who hides her horrible views- they need to get her to somehow see the error of her ways. I have no idea how you'd go about this sort of thing; education perhaps (visits to relevant museums, or watching Shoah), or seeking out reformed nationalists (like ex- gang members who talk to schools)?"
"&gt;I'm positive that she doesn't need a laptop for most of her homework

You'd be surprised. These days many teachers only give online homework."
"You have no idea if that is a ""habit"" of hers or if, as a 19-year-old, she overdid it one time. It's also completely irrelevant. If someone is passed out that doesn't give anyone the right to touch or hurt them."
"If Mark liked her, he should have said something. You don't get too sit on the sidelines and call dibs on someone.

Fact is, she's not a cow or a goat for you guys to barter over. She's a human being with her own agency, who choose you. You can accept her love or reject it, but you can't ""give"" her to Mark because she doesn't belong to either of you.

Personally, if I really loved her, I'd go for it."
"Already screen shotted without leaving a trace that I sent it to myself. Going to speak to Tony tomorrow, I think."
"Oh stop whining. She's doing the smart and logical thing.

"
"I think it's the connection she would have with the nanny, not the language itself. I'm thinking he's jealous that the nanny spends more time with her than he does. So them speaking another language together is another thing he can't do with her. He just should have addressed it better instead of coming off as racist."
"Then mom should do whatever she can to reassure OP that this is a good move. OP is 13, she won't be a proper adult until she's at least 18. She is entirely dependent on her mom until then, so it is absolutely her business who her mom dates. I don't think she's being unreasonable for being concerned. "
"Here's the perfect time to tell someone: when you have sex, don't fake it. If they ask you about it, admit that you didn't orgasm, tell them it's not about them/not their fault and that you've actually never had an orgasm at that point in your life. I don't understand what's so hard about that. Anyone who's an asshole about it or throws a tantrum doesn't get to have sex with you anymore and you move on and find someone who's understanding and willing to maybe figure out how things work for you."
"Ugh, I had a neighbor complain about my cat going to his roof and making noises every fucking night.

Even when my fucking cat was at my fucking bed sleeping is motherfuckin' ass off. Even when said cat was already dead.

Some neighbors are dicks."
"&gt; But if he doesn't, I recommend you go find a 20 something man to go spend a night in a hotel room with.

That's illogical. The direct comparison would be going with a friend and his girlfriend to a hotel room. 

&gt;The point is not that you trust him or you don't. 

The point is that she does not trust him.  She trusts him so little that he can't be around other couples. That's not healthy. 

&gt;The point is that for you, him doing it is disrespecting your relationship.

Are we just going to gloss over her controlling and distrusting nature being incredibly disrespectful to him? There is not a single sign that he has done anything wrong at all other than want to save a little money. If your partner gets bent out of shape over something irrational, you are well within your rights to call that irrational. He is now seeing her massive trust issues and stubbornness and he doesn't have to bow down and let those issues walk over him. 

&gt;Totally platonically because you can be trusted, right?

There is nothing wrong with trusting your SO. At all. Not blindly, of course, but trust should be there. Not every little thing they do -like dare to hang out with a couple because they offered you a cheaper room- should be blown into a huge ordeal. 

This is all on her. Not him. "
"Was this a relationship arranged by your cult leader, OP? Are you supposed to ascend together on Murder Night?"
"Or she is absolutely paranoid that she will forget to teach the kids something really important and they will be learning delayed as a result.

I went a bit nuts when my baby was a newborn, because I'm naturally a quiet person and don't talk much, and I was terrified that my kid was not going to acquire language because I wasn't talking enough.  I think I sounded like OP's wife the first few months.  I've relaxed since then, but I still get a bit anxious about whether she's learning enough and learning the right things and so on.  It's a frightening thought to know you may be screwing your kid up for life and not even knowing it.  "
Yeah maybe hold off until you know she won't be there so you can go back and pack your stuff. 
"I know she was forced into marriage and she could never forget her boyfriend and all this lead to the current situation.

She might have been suffering but she didn't have the right to make me and my family suffer like that. Every time i see my mom crying i just feel an insatiable urge to go and literally destroy her and her family.


"
"As far as I know, it's true. I mean she could have faked it, but her degrees are hanging in our house. And I drive her to school for her masters classes. She's showed me her published articles, I've seen her paintings, I've heard her play piano, speak French, etc. She reads a book like fucking Spencer Reid from Criminal Minds.

I'm pretty sure she's the real deal, but that makes it that much more worrisome to me that she'd forget her head if it wasn't screwed on. Sometimes I wonder if it's like a Rain Man thing."
The worst part is the buzzwords honestly. That would kill me
"I adore cats but I'm so mean, lol. I always tell my two ""you're such little shits. My little shitbirds. You're dumb little kitties but I love you anyways."" To be fair, they aren't very smart and they are shits on occasion. "
"It just sounds like he never thinks of you, has no intention of doing it, but is happy to take the benefits you bring. As long as he doesn't have to reciprocate. 

  "
I'm pretty sure you can get sued if you refuse your tenant access to the property he pays rent to.
"It sounds like he's already taking advantage of you. You've been incredibly generous to let his sister stay there rent-free. For him to basically demand that you allow his stepdad to live with you, too, is some bullshit.

It's your house. You paid for it, so you get to call the shots."
I think she's saying that she doesn't feel anything for you anymore.
"She's 35 and old enough to make her own choices. Sorry, you don't get a say. "
She saw a someone she kinda knew and asked for help while she had no shoes on in the freezing cold being berated by her abusive gaslighting boyfriend and that was a bad thing to do? The guy she did know didn't seem to give a fuck about her. 
"That's really tricky. Has he not talked about this before? Why does he think you would suddenly change job now, having been happy for years, presumably while knowing (and not caring) about your boss's orientation.

Does your boyfriend think that your boss's homosexuality can somehow affect you?"
"Basement kitchen, who the fuck even builds that?? Why?"
"Lol I was just thinking that! I'm not pregnant OR hungover but just reading her description made me so queasy. 

"
"This is so similar to a situation I was in your months ago, right down to the age difference.

Abusive bf is triggering these problems. Run far and run fast."
"I'd think that most reasonable people you'd ask would think it was a little weird for you to get into a relationship with a man who could've been your father when you're fresh out of high school. I'm not harping on your relationship, but you should understand why people may think it is odd. "
"&gt; $20,000 seems absolutely unfathomable to me.

 If you had stayed at the Manhattan suite at the Four Seasons your hotel bill alone would have been in the $25,000 ballpark.

 It's easy to blow huge amounts of money when caution is thrown to the winds. In Vegas it is easy to throw away an entire life's earnings in an evening. They will even help you do it."
"Can you call back the friend's mom who picked you up? Do you have any other friends you can reach out to? I know this is painful and maybe embarassing, but most parents will be happy to help you and want to make sure you're okay.

I know you feel bad about calling the police, but you need to take care of yourself and your little brother. You don't know how long your mom is going to be gone, you need to make sure you can get food, you need to be able to get yourself and your brother to the doctor if you get sick. If you feel up to it, you can see about getting emancipated and becoming your brother's guardian, at least for right now. This is a really big responsibility, though, and I don't know how possible it'll be to sort out."
"Just hang up the painting. She put a lot of hard work into it and she is family.

I mean put yourself in her shoes: Reddit relationship post; My sister will not hand up a painting I gave her as a house warming gift because she says it does not match with the rest of her house. 

I'd just hang it up, a large painting like that takes hours and hours to produce. What is the higher value to you. Stupid decor or your family's feelings?"
"Actually this is not entirely correct. As a former Children and youth worker for over 10 years, this information is not technically correct. It is true that they will expect visits, but these visits can, and should, be supervised by the agency or another agency that CYA contracts out to. It is 100% possible to drop the kid off at visits to the caseworker and come back after the parents have left. There is no need for foster parents to have contact with the biological parents, especially if the bio parents have been violent with the foster parents in the past. Foster parent's contact with bio parents is optional. "
What?? That's craziness. What state or situation would prompt this?
Wouldn't the best by the child also mean letting the child spend time with the stepparent that had acted as father for years?
"I think the question you really want answered is: did she fuck someone else?  And the truthful answer is: you'll never know if she did.. you just won't.  You won't ever completely know that in any relationship unless you catch them in the act or see it on video.  

Based on what you said, I would definitely end the relationship and get cracking on those cocktail meetups ;)"
"So what's the rational, non-abusive reason for one partner not ""allowing"" their partner to sleep when they're tired? Not just ""you gotta get up for work, babe,"" or ""I'm so wiped out from our kids, please don't tap out right now,"" but absolutely never allowing them to take a damn nap? Sleep deprivation is a very common aspect of abuse because it keeps people tired, sensitive, and off-kilter."
"I do acknowledge my insecurities (to her even) and I've been working very hard to be a better person in that aspect, however she just doesn't seem to be willing to compromise on her end to shutting down these very direct advances she receives.

"
You fundamentally have a communication issue. Counseling can help with that. What is your marriage worth to you?
I agree with this! Why on earth would he think it's okay for him to dictate how you should look? RED FLAG
"i'm not trying to fix the relationship at all. it's over. the issue here is that i respected his beliefs and he assured me that it was okay i didn't want to be a mom. after i got my abortion, he said he was hoping i'd change my mind about having kids. it was a mistake on my part having the procedure behind his back, but i knew the fallout would be ugly and i guess i wasn't ready for that. and given his response, i don't think being upfront about the procedure would have changed anything. 

i was on birth control, i was taking the pill, and we used protection more often than not. when we didn't use, i figured it was okay because i was on the pill. "
"But there is a difference though. First, the training schedule is temporary, and presumably will only last until November 20th. Second of all, 24-30 hours a week is essentially REQUIRED to be able to reach the goal of completing an Ironman. It's not as if her husband is choosing these hours on a whim or to spite her, its literally what he has to do to achieve his goal. "
"Man, Oregon Trail would have been a lot more interesting if they drove flaming douchewagons."
"Can she get a restraining order against them when they don't live in the same country as OP? Honestly asking since I have no idea about this stuff but I'd think it might be a bit more complicated. Or if there's something else she can legally do, what would it be?"
"He never spoke to lawyers. We just completely dropped the subject (he didn't even bring it up when I had to turn my dream job down this week). You're right. I'm sure that will be his exact response. I guess I should tell him ""yes, great, let's go speak to lawyers this week"" and try to get the ball rolling? Perhaps tell him that we need to set deadlines?"
Seconded. You let her know that being different wasn't a big deal without treating her FEELINGS like no big deal. All things considered you did very well. Follow up with her and keep up that attitude.
" Totally unrelated topic, but I really needed to hear this. Maybe a few months ago, actually..

Either way, really great advice in general. Thanks. :)"
"&gt; leaving your 13 year old son with their adult sibling is not abandoning your child. 

Yes it is. You are their parent, you are responsible. A 19 year old is not (necessarily) capable of handling this situation. You cannot hand-off your responsibility onto a family member, no matter who they are. You're a parent, you own the responsibility of being a parent, grow a pair and be a parent.  
  
OP, call CPS. Call your Dad also. "
"Give her all the mail that is addressed to her.

If she and Tom are still living together, pick up all the mail addressed to Tom and give that to her too.

Otherwise tell her ""hey, I saw a bunch of mail with late payment etc written on it, just thought you should know"".  

Then leave it alone.  Don't tell her you light-shined the letter's contents.  Just make sure she gets the stuff addressed to her.

And make sure you get your stuff out of there asap before it get's seized..."
Its probably super hard for him to eat and drink right now. He probably can't sleep comfortably or shower alone. *Especially* at 7 years old. They've got more important things to worry about than a cancelled wedding.

Emotional warfare.  Scorched earth.  Take no prisoners. 
"I work as a caregiver now. OP mentions that Alexs mom did home hospice which means that yes, a hospice nurse would have likely come by with a weekly (at least) supply of adult briefs, underpads, wipes, barrier cream, etc. And showed him how to use them because let's face it, how else would you know how to diaper an adult? 

One of the benefits of hospice is they bring you all that shit and do much of the dirty work like enemas and bathing. "
"&gt; He was following me around on Wednesday. At every break he was wanting to chat. Looking back, assuming he's straight (I honestly still really am not quite sure), he is either super clingy or interested

Or crushingly lonely and latching on to the first person who has talked to him like a human being. "
"Holy shit. I dislocated my shoulder and came home. My brother called me a dumbass and my mom took me to the hospital. I was fine.

If i did the same thing as finn my brother woyld tell me to stop being a bitch.

I think its up to the daughter with the hurt ankle and what sje wanted."
"Oh my. There's no way you can stay together and not expect this ticking time bomb of drama to go off. It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when. There's no reality where this stays a secret. Push that out of your brain right this instant. Now, we can either do a controlled detonation (tell him ASAP) or wait for it to blow on its own. Your call. 


Edit: lol, 7 break ups in 2 years. Oh god ... you're THAT couple..."
"This has nothing to do with being a man and everything to do with being a decent human being.

&gt; Sometimes when bad shit happens you have to rush into harms way to protect the things you love.

This applies to everyone."
That's one of the reasons you're debt-free! 
"Maybe... the friends/employees that were there and heard the band said something to her about the situation?  It just seems really odd that she's willing to do them a nice favor on her own, but then backtrack when she's with a bunch of people."
"Your comment contains a lot of wisdom, and I agree with the spirit of it, but want to clarify one item. 

I don't mean to split-hairs, but I think the term ""gaslighting"" may have been misused or question that it applies to the account OP provided. The only reason I bring it up is that it is an indicator of abuse that is often misunderstood or overlooked, and it's helpful for people who may be experiencing it can pinpoint it. 

Gaslighting is generally defined as a form of psychological abuse in which a victim is manipulated into doubting their own memory, perception, and sanity.

I think that E demonstrated signs of abuse toward OP, but to be fair, though he name-called and falsely accused her, we don't know whether or not he gaslighted her in the relationship. 

That being said, I think this user's advice stands and OP would do well to take those words to heart in this relationship and while considering future ones."
"You say he is obligated to you if you feel anxious or scared. The only one who can change your anxiety is you. You are headed for a divorce if you continue this mindset. You will never make your social anxiety better and he will grow to resent you.

Both of my kids (12 and 17) have social anxiety and I do whatever it takes to make them comfortable, but they both know that they are the ones at the helm.

Get some help, practice mindfulness now. Even download an app to help you keep your anxiety in check. You owe it to yourself to get over this. "
"One month in is way too early to be introducing a new date (at this point it's barely even a ""relationship"") to your child. Holy shit. She should be waiting many months and then gradually bringing you in, but it sounds like literally every time this little girl sees her mom you are there. And what happens when you break up? How many other guys has she brought around in the three years since she's been split from her ex? This is just shit parenting.

I love how the mom is blaming this on the dad, though. If I were the girl's dad I'd be furious too. This is entirely the wrong way to approach this situation.

Anyway OP, it's not up to you to do anything. This is up to the girl's mom to deal with. It sounds like she hasn't even done any reading on the topic. And there's absolutely *loads* of reading online, there are whole books about the topic, even. Hell, all she really needs to do is ask her pediatrician. There really isn't any excuse to be so cavalier and ignorant.

But my best advice would be: step off for a while and stop seeing the little girl until her parents get this figured out. Don't spend nights while she's there, don't come around while she's home."
"Having been in OP's shoes I'm inclined to agree with you. In my case we weren't living together, so it was even worse because we hardly ever saw each other. We ended up breaking up over it, but by the end it didn't even feel like I had a boyfriend anymore, anyway. It's hard when you want to support your partner in their career and you intellectually understand the stress they are under and the value it will bring *in the future*, but emotionally, you feel totally abandoned, especially when the work extended to weekends, and vacations always found a way to fall through. And of course I felt awful and needy and demanding, considering, but I just couldn't see the point in carrying on a relationship that was a relationship on name only. "
"I went to my cousin's wedding earlier this month and she did away with the bouquet toss altogether. Instead, they had a ""contest"" among the wedding attendees and gave the bouquet to the couple who had been married the longest (turned out to be my grandparents at 62 years). 

I'm regretting that I didn't think of it for my wedding- you're right, the tradition now carries different cultural connotations."
"&gt;I'd require they work at a women's shelter or donate time to help people in need. 

Why force people in need/vulnerable situations to be subjected to those two assholes?

"
"&gt;He also told her I was his 'best friend.' They were going to ask me for a threesome.

This guy is pathological."
"&gt;5'5 and 120 is acceptable. Going any lower is pushing it. 

Seconded. I'm curious what the timescale of her weightloss is. If she was losing more than 1-2 lbs a week, that would be cause for concern IMO."
Sending him the pictures will help show him that you feel the way you do
"Shared lease, and unless she was getting herself off on porn *exactly* in synch with what she was watching, she was fucking somebody.

I sent out a text to a mutual friend, I at least need to unload on this to somebody before I blow up."
Thank you. This is a issue MUCH larger than 1 special dinner. These two are both clearly not in a good financial situation and are either unable to save or don't know how/can't be bothered. This is how you destroy a relationship. 
"Know this, if she'll cheat with you she'll cheat on you. 

When faced with difficult times, will she actually come to you and face them head on, or will it be more lies? How will you be able to tell? If she can lie so convincingly for 3 years, how will you even know?"
"There is SO MUCH jumping to conclusions based on stereotypes in this thread.

Moving in by the one-year mark is totally normal, and it doesn't make her a gold-digger or a user to want to move in with him.

He has gone out of his way to frame everything in this story in terms that will make it easy to jump to the ""gold-digger"" conclusion though, like emphasizing the studio vs. condo. He goes out of his way to point out every way in which his girlfriend is less successful than him, hoping for responses exactly like this."
"Your SO seems a bit all over the place, honestly. She's putting herself in even more debt for this masters that will end up being just a title of she wants to become a doctor. "
"Yup, you nailed it, and it was driving me crazy reading comments saying that HIV is an autoimmune disease. HIV is a virus, infection with which can be prevented. As far as I know, it would be incredibly counterproductive to give a person with HIV immunosuppressants."
"Your brother was a real gent about this. He didn't have to be cool and he was well within his rights to take your key away. If I (28F) found my brother (26m) shagging someone in my bed I'd be pissed off. And it's happened before, or rather I found makeup all over my white sheets and put it together myself.

Your boyfriend should apologise, you should both thank your super-chill brother and you should both be a bit more considerate about respecting others' hospitality in the future. It's difficult to regain someone's trust when houses and things are involved."
"Wow, I came into this thread expecting something totally different.

See, the way it works is this - Crushes **happen**. At some point in your relationship - especially if you're together long enough - you're going to develop feelings, even just a little bit, for other people.

When that happens, you come forward, you let your SO know about the conflict, you cut all ties with the person so that there's no further development of feelings, or chances of infidelity.

That's what I expected to read when I came in here.

&gt; &gt;  She said that she thinks I deserve better, and that I deserved to know about this. I asked her if she liked him more than me. She said she doesn't know. I asked her if she could stop talking to him. She said it wasn't fair because he's her friend, and that she'd resent me if she had to do that. She said that she loves talking to him, and that he's ""mad cute,"" but that she still loves me.

This? Your girlfriend has told you she's not going to stop talking to her crush, she's infatuated with him, and she doesn't know how she feels. She didn't come to work on it with you - I mean she literally REFUSED to work on it - the second she said she's going to keep talking to him? The second she said she's going to keep letting things develop?

Let's just be real here man... **she just broke up with you.**

Please, for the love of God, don't wait around like some pathetic lump waiting for her to see how their relationship plays out and if things can go further. It's sad and depressing, and shows a complete lack of self worth. You're worth more than some sad sack sitting at home wondering if she's out fucking him, or falling in love with him.

You're worth way more than sitting around moping and hoping things get better. 

She told you how things are. Believe her. That's the #1 lesson in life that pops up around here. When someone tells you the truth about themselves? You believe them.

Believe her. You officially just became a question mark in her book, and unless you have absolutely no spine at all - I know for a fact you're not going to wait around with your balls in her purse while she figures out how good of a fuck he is.

Leave. And I'm sorry."
I think it's perfectly fair to accept payment in the amount you paid for it.
"So ... he likes making you feel bad. He *likes making you feel bad.* For years. For pleasure. It's not just the has this blind spot of decency/empathy over the boob thing. If it wasn't that, you know it would be something else, because it *was* something else.

I mean. There's counselling (although they don't recommend that when there's abuse and *he likes making you feel bad*). But there's also 1) being with people who like to make you feel good and 2) being by yourself. Both options have this glorious absence of people who enjoy causing you pain. 

And I just want to say he's not *reminding* you that you *are* deficient. You're *not* deficient. You are *fine*. And plenty of men would love what's under your shirt just as it is. "
I definitely understand about sexuality being a fluid this it's what i've always said about it and i've told him in the past so he shouldn't think i'm judging him or anything! Would leaving it till we're drunk again be a good idea? I'm scared shitless of doing it sober

"Kyle is fully aware about Jim. Jim and I actually kissed once about a year ago when he was 'separated' from his wife (actually a lie, they never did). There's no feelings from me except wanting to be friends. Kyle is aware of everything that people have said about us at work. 
"
"It doesn't matter where the stuff is.

I'm not an attorney so I can't give specifics, but just be safe and don't literally dump his property on the street /u/relationshipanon5."
"Ugh, you're exactly right. He asked for alone time with her to do this. What the fuck did he think was going to happen? That OPs mom would say ""you're right! I've been wrong all these years! Thank you!"" or that OP would walk in to see her sobbing (dying!) mother and find out what happened and congratulate him on being right and scoring intellectual points against a (dying!) religious person? Where was his head at? This baffles me. "
"Unfortunately you can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped. Your sister is choosing her disgusting husband here. I feel sorry for her kids, and I completely agree that they're at risk. "
"&gt;She had fondled my clothed but erect penis about 45 minutes before this (the lights were off and all cousins were chatting while lying on the same bed. I was also lying down. **She had kept her head on top of my penis and she was busy pressing it with the back of her head**). So if I misread her intentions, I must have been really bad at reading this sort of stuff! The day had a lot of hugs, hand holding, head kept on shoulder. So I must have really misread her cues. 

If she was 15 and sheltered, how do you know she even knew what an erection would feel like? "
"Asking your wife not to do something she enjoys doing simply because you don't like it is practically the definition of being controlling. 

What is it about your wife going to the bar with friends that makes you so anxious?"
"Yeah she was a really clever girl, her personality didn't change much but she became more unusual as she bought into the delusions. Fairly sure she could've written a post like this before she went off the deep end. 

Of course the more people told her she was delusional the more she thought people were against her. "
"OP is he a misogynist? He doesn't have to outright say ""women should stay in the kitchen"" or whatever to have sexist viewpoints. Often homophobia (internalized or otherwise) is synonymous with misogyny. One could argue it's actually rooted in it. 

This frame of mind correlates bottoming = being the ""woman"". And being a women is bad and less than. 

If he takes pride in being a manly man, which you made a point to say - I have little doubt he has a negative view of anything deemed feminine. Has he ever made negative comments about stereotypical ""flamboyant"" or more feminine gay men? 

I think you should see a LGBTQ specific counselor to talk through this issue. He's an adult so he will need to work to overcome this engrained mindset. 

Good luck!! "
"Are you sure though? Because I was reading one the other day where a guys GF met someone at a party, and he was going to fly her on her personal plane to a $2k a night hotel room and they *totally* weren't gonna fuck!"
"On this particular front, you have different values.


You may well find that the divide goes deeper than you suspected as you flesh this out.  It can be easy to overlook some of the differences that come out between believers and non-believers until you have to apply them to something, like having kids.  

Or not.  You might be fine, and find a compromise that works.  But I think you need to approach it not as a moving parts problem, but as looking for a routine to satisfying both of your differing values.  "
"You did the right thing.

even when there are no prohibitions against this sort of thing, the consequences aren't worth it.

At the very least, you guys have an obvious power imbalance which makes true intimacy practically impossible.  I do not hold you so much accountable, you're the student and you were in a vulnerable situation.  He should have known better."
"&gt; But I don't understand why she was demanding an apology in the first place, because she should know that I didn't mean to steamroll over her.

""She should know""

Again, that puts the blame on her. When she's told you that this is a problem for her, and you've done nothing to address it. 

Shouldn't YOU know that communicating this way is going to upset her?"
"I'm on your side. I'd go absolutely insane if I had a kitchen in the basement. It's the worst remodeling idea I have heard of. And if you guys ever want to sell, you'll have as much trouble finding a buyer as the current owners are. It's a terribly designed home."
"This is definitely above your and this sub's pay grade. 

I have never had an eating disorder, but I can definitely relate to the anxiety portion, and the hesitation of speaking to a therapist. I was very much ""nahhh, I got this"" for a long time, until I hit rock bottom again with multiple days of non-stop anxiety and a panic attack that required an ER visit. I couldn't do it on my own anymore, and I realized the impact my anxiety was having on my quality of life. Maybe she hasn't hit her rock bottom yet. 

Especially when you get stuck in a cycle of constant anxiety, depression, and self-destructive behaviors, it can be very hard see life outside that small bubble. She really needs to realize that her behavior is not just impacting her, but you as well. She needs to get this eating disorder under control before she does permanent harm to her body, mental health, and relationship. 

Would she be more comfortable attending more sessions if you were there with her as a support person?"
"People are rough on her because she's insanely myopic and immature. She has an extremely inflated view of herself and, while she came to the correct conclusion, did not seem to have absorbed any of the substantive reasons why. 

And the only person who'd be a worse partner than OP in the previous post would be her boss. That would never work out. "
"I think you need to talk to him about whether this is really just a sexual fetish or if he wants this to be your relationship dynamic 24/7 because there is a difference and it might be something you don't agree on. Just like BDSM, you can be kinky just in the bedroom or you can live the master/collared lifestyle. Neither is wrong to do if that's what you're interested in, but both people need to be interested in doing it for it to work."
"My 2 cents:

Your fiancee is insecure. His way of dealing with that is to sexualize it. Sexualizing it allows him to own his insecurities and gives him a measure of control. Heading up to the wedding, his insecurities are getting worse, causing him to act out his fantasy in a more and more extreme fashion in order to attempt to control it.

Regardless of how correct I am or am not, this is a serious issue. I would postpone the wedding until he accepts therapy. Your wedding is about the two of you, not his kink."
"playing devil's advocate,   were your bedroom door left open when you left.   

I had problems with my own cats shitting on my clothes/bed when left them alone for the day despite having a clean litter box.   Then you told him to watch for messes,  but he probably never stepped a foot in your bedroom.   If he came by twice a day,  that's plenty of time during the day to go piss/shit in your room and the mess gradually grew everyday.   he may have come as promised and never saw anything wrong.   It only takes 1 of them to go, and because of the smell they will all use your bedroom as a litter.

I wouldn't jump to conclusion,  and for the future: Get him or someone else to keep the dog at their house for the weekend.  For the cats, close all bedroom doors,  make sure they have twice as much litter options and have him visit the once/twice a day to interact/play with them.

"Both my wife and I ended up in research, and we're certainly among the minority out of our peer group from our school.  

The odds are better at elite schools, but it's still brutal.  There's a huge opportunity cost (financially and time-wise) for a *chance* at one of those coveted top end jobs.  

At least he's considering industry positions, but the jump from MS to PhD isn't all that large in many fields.  Maybe he's in one of the ones that does have a big salary bump, but we don't know that.  

&gt;Sometimes, we just don't get to do what we'd like to do.

While OP didn't sign up to have a SAHW, I doubt his wife would say she signed up to have spouse who was a student for most of his late 20s and early 30s.  

OP made the choice to get married and have kids.  Grad school is a simple choice when you're a single 22 year old, not so much when you're married-with-kids in your 30s.  This is a lot more complicated situation than most of the comments are giving credit for.  "
"I was pretty honest with him from when I first met him that I was not only not interested in him, but not interested in dating at all. He even confirmed this with me later on and I stayed firm on it. What he was most upset about was that he was not a special case. He actually said to me in this conversation that what was worse was that he was like every other guy in my life. I never lead him on, he always knew where he stood with me and still he fooled himself into thinking there could be more. "
"Reality check: You and your wife set an appropriate and considered boundary and your mother couldn't stand that. Her reaction and subsequent behavior are childish and irrational. You suggest in your post that she has behaved this way in the past, and I think if you hadn't been raised by her you wouldn't even be doubting yourself for a second for your decision.  You did nothing wrong. Your wife did nothing wrong. Let that thought sink in. 

Possible script for you over the next few weeks with your mom when the topic comes up. ""Yes, it's unfortunate that it wasn't possible for us to host the wedding. How's your kid/dog/the Phillies?""  Repeat like a broken record. If you have to, switch to ""This conversation doesn't seem to be very productive. I hope we can have a more enjoyable talk later. Bye.""

I also want to suggest a great advice site called Captain Awkward that has a lot of great ideas and advice about dealing with difficult people of all descriptions. 

Best of luck. "

Tell her to hire a photographer for her 31st so you can see how much fun she had.
"Its the ""implication"""
"I read Op's comment history and apparently he cheated on her when she was 18 and thats why they broke up the first time. The second time was because of distance. IMHO as an older brother, I would be cautious of this man who started dating my sister when she was 16 and he was 20, then proceeded to break her heart by cheating on her. Id probably still have a grudge on him after all these years..."
"That's his problem, not yours. Just say no and your reason above. It's not difficult. Go respond now and get it over with so you stop stressing about it unnecessarily. "
"&gt;his argument was that he was not comfortable with me wearing clothing like this, that he considered my outfit inappropriate, and that guys would look at me if I wore it out. 

Look, let me tell you -- guys don't care if you're in a crop top or a potato sack. If they think you're attractive, they're going to look. I've been catcalled wearing a chocolate-stained, oversized beige t-shirt, dirty jeans and a baseball cap (worked in an ice cream shop.)

&gt;He said that if I respected him and our relationship, I would not wear clothing like this and I would consider him before I even put it on. He said that if I wanted to dress like I was single, I could be single. I asked him if he was threatening to break up because of what I was wearing, and he said he was, since he considered it a serious problem. 

OP, unless you want a relationship in which the other person threatens to break up with they don't get to dictate what you look like, then this isn't the guy for you.

&gt;Now, I tend to acquiesce to what he says in hopes of avoiding conflict.

This is so very not okay.

OP, if he can't handle your style, tell him to make sure his next girlfriend signs an agreement that she will only wear baggy sweats for the duration of their relationship.

I get the feeling all of this is based in some insecurity that he's afraid someone will steal you away -- as if you have no mind of your own and are incapable of saying ""no thanks."" "
"I suspect you're 100% spot-on, but if true, doesn't make her behavior at all acceptable.

"Are you in america? If so HIPAA dictates that you can tell your supervisor that you have a doctor's appointment bi weekly for the next  14 weeks, and they don't need any more info.

They might not pay you, which you should be prepared for since you aren't actually working. 

Don't make up excuses, it's a doctor's appointment and that is ok. "

"Well I have to side with Dee on this one. If you go on a date, especially in a situation where you're working on a rocky relationship, don't play on your phone. You can do it later. If you can't just enjoy the date and the company of your girlfriend for a few hours, you might not be mature for a relationship."

"If she knew he was thinking and talking that way about her, I doubt she would want to be around him. I would be very concerned he might at some point start saying these things to her or even worse try to grope her or something. "
I'm fucking dumbfounded by this entire thing. Please try to go outside more and interact with more people so you can learn basic human interaction.

Keep on keeping on; your future is golden! "
"Yes, because paying child support is taking responsibility. Also, you cannot force a dying person to have an organ transplanted into them, you cannot force someone to give blood, and on the line of ""you cannot force someone to have a medical procedure"" you cannot force or pressure someone to have an abortion.

Similarly, you can't force someone to have a baby. In my country, anyone of any age can obtain an abortion paid for with government funding, and though it is recommended, you do not need to tell a parent. More girls stay in school, more women go university, women can focus on their careers rather than being whisked off their feet by the medical, emotional, physical, and financial impact of a baby."
"You moved on to another girl *while you were still dating Kate*, and you can't understand how Kate could move on after she broke up with you?

Did you really expect her to wait around, turning down perfectly nice guys, for some arbitrary amount of time?

I'm usually on board with this sub's general ""all feelings are valid"" attitude, but *you do not get to be sad or resentful that your ex, who you cheated on, is moving on with someone else.* Hopefully this will at least teach you to never cheat again--it will just end up with you being lonely and your ex finding someone else.

"We have a professor in our department who is married to a grad student. He is not allowed to TA for her, even when his funding was guaranteed. In this case, I don't think you are going to get in trouble, but he certainly could. 

Check with your union rep, if you are unionized. I'd also check in with your ombudsperson -- they are obligated to be confidential. "
"I'm shocked The conversation on location to raise your children never came up. Had you always agreed to stay in the city? Never discussed moving? These issues should have been addressed the moment you found out you were pregnant.

The way your husband is approaching this isn't ideal but his root ambition is a positive. He wants to provide success and support to you and your family. A lot of times socially beneficial and financial beneficial are mutually exclusive. Not always, but a lot of the time.

Lots of info is missing in this write up. Current incomes and careers are important here. Do you both work? Do you both make good money? How long do you both intend to work? Are you both happy in your current jobs?

Another important aspect, does your husband have any experience running a business. It's not as easy as it looks. Index funds might be a safer long term option. If he wants a more hands on approach investing in a rental property could work.

You guys have some obvious kinks to iron out, but the idea of running to a divorce attorney seems pretty extreme. If he was to find out irreparable damage might be done to the relationship. 

I would establish ground rules. How do you guys currently manage your money? Do you keep joint accounts? Do both incomes  get shared equally and joint property? 

Best of luck"
"Alright, so what I'm getting from this conversation is that you really weren't that into her. You seemed to quite like the idea of having a girlfriend, but not the realities associated with that (like her being around messing up your stuff, and wanting her boyfriend to touch her freaking vagina).

I've basically run out of advice.  I know you're upset that you're getting dog piled on, but it's happening for a reason - because you're just wrong, **so wrong**, and you need to have a good long think about how you treated her, and how you process things."
"I was just about to link that post. But seriously, don't just read the post, read the subtext. Here is a guy who is having trouble convincing his wonderful girlfriend she is more than she has been conditioned to believe she is. Your sister sounds like a priss and not someone i'd be interested in dating. I'm sure she can be a fine person, but anyone who can say put down their sibling like that isn't someone i'd be interested in. 

First you need to understand, ""pretty"" ""beautiful"" and the like are not objective standards, the saying beauty is in the eye of the beholder literally refers to the fact that each and every person experiences physical attraction in different ways. If your boyfriend finds you beautiful, that is fact enough for him to express it to you. If you don't find yourself beautiful, its something you have to look at yourself, no one can MAKE you believe it, but hopefully your boyfriend can at least convince you there is something there worth loving about yourself. 

Lastly, and this might be the most obvious. Him seeing someone you think is objectively prettier than you (see above paragraph about why i think objective prettiness is stupid) and you jumping to the conclusion to him wanting to jump ship, or feel dissatisfied with his relationship with you, takes away from your faith in him to make his own choices. He CHOSE you, and any guy who would flip to his girlfriends sister just because she might be prettier isn't the kind of guy you want to be in a relationship with anyways."
"...do you like being in pain?

Honest question. I've played around with masochism, and sometimes that's something that really works for me. The way you're talking about this doesn't seem normal, though. You've said you have had traumatic sexual experiences. You cry and scream during sex. You specifically have a hard time with sex because you're afraid and ashamed. 

This doesn't sound normal, and it doesn't sound consensual. Please get help."
"It's not the smart thing because he's not a mind reader and people are unpredictable. 

There are so many ways that scenario could have played out. For example if one of your attackers was a violent schizophrenic (we can't tell this by looking at someone) who decided to just start knifing you. Essentially, having someone there to help you defend yourself is much better in that kind of scenario.

I agree with the many people in here who don't believe that he weighed up choices before reacting. The fact he's simultaneously trying to present it that way while also trying to hide it from people sort of reinforces this. 

To me this is the most problematic part - he's trying to re-write what happened and he's trying to block you from talking about your experience and processing it in the way you normally would."
"Bear in mind that you don't know the sounds of this house yet. You might hear a door close--because you don't know how drafts work here yet, either.  I had a place where the bathroom door would pop open and shut all night depending on if it was breezy outside.

It's easy to populate the shadows with horrors, when you're somewhere new or you're alone.  Play some music, put the TV on, read a book or play a video game.  

Or if worse comes to worst, you can do what my stepdad did when he moved into a ""very badly haunted"" defunct mine hospital in a little town in AZ, to be the building's caretaker.  There was only power in the room he lived in, and that came by generator; he wasn't within screaming distance of the town itself, and he had to go around the building a couple of times a night with a flashlight to make sure there weren't any teens or vagrants messing it up.  

When he got there, he sat down, let the quiet fill his ears, and said ""I'm going to be living here now.  I don't want to mess with you, and I don't want you to mess with me.  I'm just going to go about my life, I'm not poking into anything, I'm only here to handle living people stuff. I'll leave you alone, so please leave me alone.""

He never saw or heard a damn thing.  Ever.  The hospital was eventually bought and beautifully refurbished into ""The Most Haunted Hotel in Arizona,"" or somesuch shit, and people who work there or go there to stay insist constantly that they're seeing things, hearing things, that the towels fold themselves and the old elevator runs on its own.  But my stepfather lived in that building in the _dark_, for years, just him and his easily-spooked dog, and everything left him alone.

Another thing...

&gt;Something about human bones were found near the house 30 years ago, which were the bones of slaves or something from way back, a little after the whole slave thing happened in America. 

Dude, this entire country is built on genocide and slavery.  There's nothing special or unusual about some poor abused soul having died close to your house.  Millions of Native Americans were killed. Millions of men, women and children lived and died as property, treated in the absolute cruellest ways, and if dying a slave was sufficient to make someone into a ghost, this entire country would be haunted top to bottom, every damn inch.

"&gt; I have no doubts that he authentically loves me - there's never been a question regarding his interest and devotion in me.

If this were the case, he would leave his wife and figure out a custody arrangement to be with you.  But he didn't.  So that probably means he doesn't love you in the way you think he does or want him to.  Sorry.  The reason most sugar daddies turn to a website for that stuff is that they want to have sex with someone younger not to find love and this seems to be the case here."
"It sounds like you thought that when you crossed marriage off the list of possibilities, that meant for you that you two were in a partnership but just not legally married, while he thought he was in a relationship that was not as serious as a marriage or partnership. If you want to share lives and futures together, and plan to support each other long-term and mingle finances, that is a conversation you need to have. You can't assume that because you give him rides and drive to visit his parents that he would choose to have a car. Maybe he'd occasionally rent one. Maybe his parents would come pick him up. He'd have the home depot deliver. Also, if you are doing all that work as his property manager, you should be getting paid as his property manager. "
"It sounds like him (and you) have some baggage that only a professional can help work through.

I would suggest that until you both start seeing a good therapist that deals with childhood trauma or things are not going to get better. 

The things he says are mean and abusive. I am not sure why you want to stay with him. Perhaps leaving him, or threatening to leave until he goes to therapy might be beneficial to you both."
"In all likelihood, she's not pregnant. However, even if she is, it's really her decision what happens, whether she keeps it or not, whether she keeps you in her life or not. 

All you can do is try (without being pushy) to keep in contact, and learn from the experience. 

The lesson to be learned is this: any time (ANY time) it slips off, you have what is called a condom-failure. In ANY case of condom failure, run your ass to the drug store and get emergency contraception. No exceptions.

"It's ok. It was close to the final straw. It at least threw into distinct relief that I could not depend on him for anything, ever.

And if it is this early in their relationship (not even married) and he's essentially blowing off her freakin' birthday, it's not going to get better. It usually just gets worse.

I don't think it was a lie to him, it was a fantasy that he tried to make into reality. He started to believe his own lies which is why he felt he had to keep it together, no matter the cost. It sounds to me like he was trying to cover the truth because he didn't want to relive it."

"It's very hard not to view a second, gigantic destination wedding with all the trappings and goings-on after you're already married as anything but a cash grab from people who weren't important enough to invite to the real ceremony.  If you want people to treat your big destination wedding as the real thing, then you need to actually get married then.

Most people would understand doing it a few days to a few months beforehand to get legal shenanigans out of the way (especially to clear up passport issues and changing your name)  but a two-year gap is just tacky.

If you need to get married now, then get married now, but this is going to be your real wedding and the one everyone thinks of as the real wedding.  If you want to throw a party, late honeymoon, or whatever in two years in a destination location, that's fine - more of a general celebratory party.  But don't expect gifts, cake, flowers, and big poufy dresses to go over well.

If you want a destination wedding, plan your destination wedding and make other arrangements in the meantime."

- Don't talk about your promotion. If he insists on talking about it, say ""I don't want to discuss this without Cara present. I'll schedule a meeting for the three of us on Tuesday or Wednesday.""
- Don't offer much about yourself at all if you can help it. Ask him about the summer camp. Ask about his summer. Let him talk as much as he wants. You just act like a gray rock. Talk about news in the sport you both follow, or talk about upcoming events. 
- Schedule a phone call/text for 4:10, with a follow-up at 4:20, so you can bail out of the meeting fairly quickly if it's going badly. 

Now, about that meeting with Cara (and Dick). This is where you talk about your promotion. Start with the provable, demonstrat-able things:

- Dick no-called, no-showed for shifts. Multiple shifts. If this company has an employee handbook, I'll bet big dollars that it says that's grounds for immediate termination, effective on the date of the no-call, no-show. If you can, have that page handy. Not as a threat, but to communicate what you &amp; Cara assumed by Dick's behavior: he *abandoned* his job. He *walked away* from it. That was obvious. Cara didn't fire him because she's mean, and you weren't promoted because you hate him, he just quit the job by abandoning it. 
- As a result of his no-call, no-show, you were given authorization to do his job, and you did it well. Revenue was up for the period when you were in charge. Customer comments were uniformly positive. After he *abandoned* his job, you stepped up and did a good job.
- After doing his job, you received a review from Cara and a promotion in response to the quality of your work. You expect Cara to honor her commitments to you. This isn't about being angry at Dick (you both assumed he quit by walking away, right?) and it isn't about being angry at her, this is about *honoring professional commitments*. If she breaks the deal, your (outward) emotion should be to be disappointed in her. 

If, after meeting with Cara and Dick, he's given his old job &amp; his old hours back, tell them you're taking personal time, starting immediately. Two weeks minimum, and because Cara promised you a raise and benefits, that includes paid time off. Then get up, walk out, and look for a new job. "
"""Unplanned""

&gt; Last night she messages me all this shit about how I need to find myself and live my dreams because she's found hers yada yada.

Translation: ""I've changed, and now realize I don't love you any more.""

I'm sorry, OP."
"I have to agree with this. Sure, it's the oldest joke in the book, but I don't like the whole 'ball and chain' stereotype it reinforces. I mean, when you think about it, the joke is ... that women are terrible and you should run away from them? That marriage means you will never have fun again? I would have been offended as well. Sure, it was a spur of the moment thing, he didn't think about it, blah blah, but at 30, he could know better. 

On the other hand, me and my fiance got some jokes to this effect when we got engaged, and I was really happy when he shut that down immediately - he just told everyone he can't wait to marry me. It's not a big gesture, but it really made me feel very secure about the the wedding and the future.

"Honestly this. Porn for me is just like.... a way to jerk off real quick to relieve stress. I rarely spend mlre than 8 minutes, its just like... kinda gross. The fact that he values porn over OP is concerning and the fact that he wants OP to look like a pornstar is even more concerning"
"Ah, ok, so he's probably as worried as your parents about you getting 'corrupted by American culture' or something.

Just don't divulge anything about your private life to them any more. And even though you will acquiesce to their demands, you should give your brother an earful. Cultural or not, he ratted you out. "
"No, because for her the problem is he is always expecting sex. If they agree on no sex on the other days, she knows he can't be expecting sex because he won't be getting it."
She isn't using these words to her mil. She's allowed to vent and shouldn't have to be judged by someone who is being overly sensitive on behalf of a stranger who won't ever read this.
"You are a kid, they are adults, that's the only reason they need. You are way too young to be having sex. "
"It's irrelevant though. I agree the whole homework thing has been overblown in recent years, but the fact is her school assigns homework and her grades will be impacted if she doesn't do it.  That's all that's relevant to the discussion as far as negative impact goes."
"I would love to hear his ex's version of events. Because so far the main thing he's whining about her saying

&gt;Any time I bring up things and try to have discussions about them, I'm accused of ""always playing the victim"" and further gaslighting.

....seem to be pretty fucking spot on. What a headache to deal with.

""You refer to my child as my child! How dare you!"""
"Yeah I dont think you understand my comment. Some people just get out of control when they drink, even thought they are otherwise perfectly normal individuals"
"&gt;What did she do, go to the bar and ask around for who has a smaller dick, and then go have sex with that guy?  

Excellent point. How did she know what size the other people were before the process had already started? She was cheating and used the size incompatibility as an excuse to shift some of the blame for her bad behavior on to you and your biology that you have no control over. Terrible."
"LOL 19 years pp... Love it. My youngest is nearly 9 but I still like to blame my extra poundage as ""baby weight."" ""Oh how old is your baby?"" ""105 months!"" "
"That's cool, ours do too. You still need a referral (or two, or three...), and there are still waiting lists. 

Also, debt is a serious issue even for healthy people. Personally, my issues become worse when the stress of debt is piled on top of everything else that's going on. I think that'd be a really tough win/lose situation.  "

"You might also want to consider social status/economics. This behavior sounds like people who grew up ""making do"" and using up as little space as possible, or were never taught that spaces have specific functions, and therefore use them thusly.

You and your parents sound like you come from a better educated background where things like placemats matter and are used daily. 

Source - I've found myself in a similar boat on more than one occasion. What was common place in my house was considered to fancy/snobby/artsyfartsy by others. Our silverware lived in a drawer. Theirs lived in a glass on the table."
Thought of doing that too! 
"If he's travelling for work constantly ias there a reason you have to live in his home town? 

He's never there anyway so why no move somewhere you're comfortable with so you can make the most out of your time there. Move closer to your parents (if you want) and have them watch the baby once a week or something to that effect. 

Now obviously there are some issues beyond just location, but this may be a good start and it opens up the road for negotiation. It could also help show how seriously this situation is effecting you. You're not just kinda bummed, you actively need change. "
"I had a friend who did this. She was in her late twenties, and she was walking around wailing and crying, kicking and hitting things, and calling friends sobbing for days and weeks. 

Turns out later that she had an anti social personality disorder. Both the impulse to constantly change her hair, thinking if she just did it ""one more time"" it would be perfect and she'd finally feel good about herself, and her reaction to it never happening, were a result of her having mental health issues. 

She had no sense of self, and was very black and white about things. She was always looking for the perfect job, outfit, boyfriend, place to live, career, was because she had no idea who she was if she wasn't trying on all these personas. Then when it failed to change everything and make it perfect, she'd fall apart. 

I am not saying your sister is mentally ill, and this is somewhat more appropriate for a teenager than an adult, but still not normal. "
"Right? That's pretty awkward. Especially since even if she was his FWB OP already knew that was years and years ago. Obviously there are other issues in this relationship to even care about who he slept with ten years ago.
"
When people ask that what they really mean is if they should communicate that their spouse weight gain has reached a point where it can't be tolerated and has become a problem in the relationship. Obviously the spouse will know they have gained weight but they may not be aware of how much of a problem it is for their SO. 
I will second this. Totally take naked selfies for me. I don't send nudes. 
"I agree in principle, but I have one eye on the risk of OP being accused of parental alienation in a future custody battle. It would be better to have them talk about it to a counsellor. OP could tell the counsellor that dad isn't the most engaged parent since his first wife died, and she thinks the kids can sense it, but she doesn't want to undermine him. The counsellor can give the validation while OP gets to keep the high road. Or, the counsellor may ""give permission"" for OP to discuss it with the kids, but she shouldn't do it before that."
"I think C) is probably a pretty big difference between you and your Fiance, you didn't want to abandon your Fiance for whatever reason (my thought process would be that fleeing aggravates or spooks your assailants)

I  also agree with a lot of the other comments here; your fiance can claim that it was the smarter move, but it seems the extent he keeps claiming what he  did was right but that he doesn't want anyone else to know suggests he's also quite unsure of his own motive for running. 

Therapy is definitely a must in this situation. Both as a couple and individual therapy for the two of you. "
"I worry that now Audrey will be further emboldened and believe all the more that unlike you, OP, she knows best and she'll take your daughter to meet Lisa. She's already been pressuring you to meet with Lisa, saying you owe Lisa a chance to apologize to you and you should make amends. Given that Audrey doesn't respect your opinions, views, history, feelings, or boundaries and feels she knows infinitely more than you do, how can you trust her? "
"On my way to her right now, i will update the post soon enough. "
This is the best description of food I've ever read.
"This, and don't pressure her to be nude either. Tell her about it, gauge her reaction, and if she seems interested, give it a try. If she likes it, you can continue to suggest it but if she refuses DON'T PUSH IT.

To a non-nudist, getting badgered to take off your clothes when you just want to relax IN your clothes is really super off-putting, and kinda creepy."
"Yeah, her fiance planned for her to be molested by his buddy. And even if it was meant to be a joke, there's nothing funny with insinuating that your fiancée would be seduced by unexpected gropings

What the fuck?"
"You need a new boyfriend who isn't this ungrateful, entitled, and just plain stupid "
"Well, at least now you know you still can't trust your sister. Sorry..."
You need to give us a lot more information. Just saying you found her reddit and read it is not enough. What was she saying? 
"This needs to be higher. Brother didn't respect OP's comfort, her marriage, or even possibly her consent. "
"At the very, very least, he wouldn't want a room with the damn boyfriend in it. "
That not a healthy amount of sleep for an adult let alone a child. 
"Lol...Japanese-American doesn't mean one parent is one and one the other. It means they're ethnically Japanese (maybe 100%, 50%, 25%, doesn't matter), but are American citizens. Kind of like African American doesn't mean someone has one African parent and one American parent."
An adult asking me as a child what I would put in a candy soup would have been a very intriguing and difficult question back then.
And you didn't find another therapist with more expertise in this area? 
"...and a ""single mother with kids and a mortgage"" is a great place to be when it comes to taxes."
"The thing about death is, it's a decision you can't reverse. Picking it is unwise. 

I realize you're in a lot of pain, and it's been that way for a while. Here is the number for suicide prevention. It's open 24 hours. 1-800-273-8255. There is also a Lifeline Crisis Chat if you're a tester, but you'll have to google that.

You should also find a therapist. Therapy is uncomfortable for people to talk about or go through. The first day is also so unnerving. I almost couldn't do it! I'm glad I did. My life isn't perfect after it, but I'm better as a person, and I'm learning how to handle particularly bad emotions. 

You keep calling yourself broken. That your family is breaking. But you also sound young. The thing about young people, is you don't understand just how long 70 years is. Childhood has so many twists and turns, so many changes, so many things happening at once that the thought of working at the same place doing the same thing for 20 years doesn't even compute. Dating while young is also different. Kids who've always heard about romance sex and relationships are thrust into the world with hormones and only the vaguest idea of how to handle it. Many bad relationships are during this time, because everyone is new. You don't always know what to spot for an abuser or cheater, you don't always know how to treat the other person right, and communication is a series of dos and do nots. Your ""soul mate"" may leave, or be uninterested, or change, and you'll think you'll never love again, and then you do, and it's strange. All you can do is learn from theme each step gets you closer to finding the right person. 

Your family breaking isn't your fault. **Your family breaking isn't your fault**. I don't know what caused you to feel determined to keep your family together, but the ties that bind family to you shouldn't be so fragile. People who love you will find the time and methods to reach out to you. Distance and blood doesn't make a family. Love does. So please, don't blame yourself. Just reach out to those you love.

There's so much time to enjoy, and that means there's also time to heal and fix yourself. Please, start by calling that number. They are trained to be there for you."
"Yes, this is absolutely terrifying. "
"I have seen people have succes with it. It doesnt help everyone, but i have yet to hear from someone where it made things worse"
"I can see where you are coming from, my grandfather didn't get along with his family and used distance to keep it healthy. But he was invited and there for the big things, but he and they behaved civilly. From what you have said I suspect your sister cannot for the 6-10 hours a wedding and reception takes. "
"It's sad how the type of person who acts this way finds a partner who thinks that love means doing everything you can to deal with the other person's shit in order to make him/her happy. And it never works! He isn't going to appreciate her, because she's already done everything she can to placate him, and now if she's NOT then she's a nuisance. I had to get out of a marriage that went like this."
"Nevermind Hank and his parents.  Your husband is actively destroying his relationship with your son.  Your son is 14.  He is way smarter than all this.  He sees and he knows and he understands at this point what dear ol' dad is up to.  ""Dad doesn't care about me, he just uses me to get what he wants...""  I see a possible lifetime of resentment if this isn't sorted.

"She asked for his input. She said, ""I never, ever want children."" He said he accepted that and continued having sex with her. Just because he regrets the choice he made to continue having sex with someone who was clear they'd abort doesn't mean he didn't make a choice. "
"I am going to guess if he's now confessing to messing with ""just the condoms"" he probably messed with more than that.  "
"""in love"" after 1.5 weeks and only 3 months of dating, already thinking about marriage, and claiming to not care how many partners she's had (haha yeah right) but merely wondering if she ""cheats on god"" will she cheat on you??

"Hey, here's an idea: is this the only ""art club"" of its kind in the city? Are there any other art clubs/salons/schools/klatches for art in your area? 

Because if your boyfriend is well-established enough to be an instructor, he probably has some social connections in the art scene, right? Which means he could probably recommend you to some of those other classes/groups/studies. Not only would that help you network and let you work on establishing yourself, but you &amp; Mr Art could 'come out' with your relationship, right? 

Or (and this is just an idea) if there are other art groups, maybe Mr. Art can see about teaching and mentoring in one of those groups. That's not as great for your development as an artist, but it means you don't have to keep sneaking around anymore, right? And he can honestly tell people that he left the group because he didn't want things to look bad, right? 

I wonder how well those ideas would go over with Mr. Art..."
"This is exactly how I feel. I have no idea how I didn't notice, I just know I thought she was really beautiful the first time I saw her and still do now. 

I will say though that I hardly ever notice individual features about people's faces. Like even if I'm really familiar with someone, chances are I couldn't tell you what color eyes they have, or describe anything significant at all about the size/shape of their nose, jaw, ears, etc... I guess I should just hope that I never have to describe someone to a crime sketch artist. "
"&gt; I would just like to add, as it was said in one comment, that I am EXTREMELY NON-CONFRONTATIONAL

"Please don't even think you are wasting anyone's time.
Terribly sorry for what you are going through.
"
"Hmmm... you sound like a people pleaser. Would you say that is accurate?

I think the thing you need to do is to change your perspective on this.

1. You can't control other people. How they feel, what they think, how they act. Etc.

2. You don't have a responsibility to make everyone happy, to be liked by everyone, and to make sure everyone gets along. So stop trying.

3. People are people. They are erratic, irrational, and complex. And above all else, they are animals.

4. Change your EXPECTATIONS into realistic boundaries. You had expected that this whole in-law thing was going to be just fine since you and your mother are good people. Wrong. Realistically you can't force people to like you, you can't even expect it, but you can ask for and demand respect. If you don't get respect you can leave the situation IE. go no or low contact with the woman and have your husband be the point of contact. 

5. Your husbands family disrespecting you is his job to patrol. Not yours. You can give the boundary lines to your husband. That is about all the power you have here.

6. Get over it. Accept it. Move on. Use your energy and worry to think about things you DO have control over.


My IL's hate me. They hated me before they met me. They hated me because of what I represented: that my SO moved away from their way of life to a place where women like me existed. Not the lifestyle, culture, or women that they wished for him. Even though it isn't really about me, even though it is really about him choosing a different life for himself they didn't want for him, they take it out on me. 

Luckily I am NOT a people pleaser. Never have been. So once I met them, gave them the chance to spend some time with me, and they still decided to aggressively let it be known I was not their cup of tea, I decided that much like a job interview, the decision goes both ways. You are just as much interviewing them as they are you.

So I flipped the script. I don't like them. I think they are bad judgmental people. I think they are small minded and believe that since my SO came from their loins that he needed to follow along some life path they choose. Nope. I think they would only be happy if he moved back home and married a girl they picked out. Only if he decided to make the life choices they picked for him. He has no say. He is an extension of their feelings of worth. 

Due to this being the case, I have systematically shut that shit down. Guess who leaves me the fuck alone now? They do. They don't get invited over to OUR home. He doesn't call them back until he is able to talk, not beholden to when they want to speak to him. He never allows them the chance to ask to talk to me over the phone. Because he knows after many discussions that they are not my IN LAWS they are strangers who raised my SO. They lost the right to treat me like family when they treated me with disrespect for no other reason than their own insecurities. 

The issue you are having is the same one many young people go through when they have a crush and just can't understand why the object of their affection doesn't like them back. If only they could do or say the right thing it would all work out right? No. That isn't how this works. 

TLDR: Get over trying to be one big happy family, and realize it is your husbands family, and that there needs to be a very firm and safe boundary between your IL's and your immediate family unit. Don't stand for disrespect from people you owe nothing to. "
Just reading that made me feel like shutting up
"I think you are being down voted because you are not being direct here.  It was specifically suggested that you check your testosterone levels and you just said your last checkup you are perfectly healthy for your age.  It just seems a little vague, like you got a physical but not your hormone levels checked."
"&gt; Dogs are however considered unique property, not simple personal property.

Do you have any statutes or case law to support this? This is also highly likely to vary state-by-state.

I am concerned that you are misspeaking again. To provide you a caselaw example (for a case that I do not recall the name of, my apologies), in the Ninth Circuit (covers California and a ton of other states), dogs are property as far as the Fourth Amendment is concerned. In the relevant case, a police officer shot a dog after entering a home under somewhat questionable circumstances. The plaintiff attempted to plead this (in addition to other activities by the police engaged in against human beings) as excessive force, and the three-judge panel more or less flatly said that dogs are property (with nothing special about them).

Edit: Another response you give below suggests that the factual context you relayed is precisely within the bounds of a typical personal property situation (at least as far as the law is concerned)."
A half hour of homework a night is very little.  (Mom said it's half an hours worth of work.)  Where I went to school they were loading us with hours of homework every night by the time we could write.  We had to read and write reports on every subject every night except Friday and Saturday.
"As I understand it, you probably have zero legal rights. Obviously, consult a lawyer to be sure. 

Keep in touch with the Grandparents. Try to arrange times to see the children when they are with the Grandparents. 

I'm honestly a little disturbed that your partner's children call you mom. Of course, every family dynamic is different. But this may be why you haven't heard anything from them. Were these my children, I would not be amused. I would also not be inclined to communicate with my exs partner if the ex is deceased.

"Kinda snobby imo, you got a good job and you're not in debt. Tell her to suck it (maybe don't, but express that you could care less about where you get your shit), and that it doesn't matter where you buy your stuff, you're paying for it. Sounds you should be embarrassed of her, being superficial and shallow."
"&gt;when you bring her over for dinner, get up and sincerely apologize for what you did and how you acted

Ugh, and make a big show of what a great person he is for making a splashy public apology, so they can all feel like OP is oh-so-noble? As if one public spectacle ""makes up for"" the other? (Because that's what they'll think). No, this doesn't need to be a stand up and swagger speech. It needs to be a serious, sit-down, come-to-Jesus talk on *her* terms. *If* she's willing to consider it, and I'd seriously advise her not to."
"You treated her like shit and she decided you weren't worth it.

You fucked up, kid. And there's nothing you can realistically do to fix it. Move on and learn from this. Don't be such an asshole to the next girl.

"M of a closed MFF triad of a few years here.

First off, let's be 100% clear about something: No one ""forgets"" to use condoms. She just didn't, and she probably hasn't for quite a while. Don't kid yourself on this. With that having been said...

*The primary issue is this:* Your wife violated your relationship in an extremely major way by not using condoms with her boyfriend. This was dangerous to your health and endangered the timeline of the future you had agreed on with her. You would be well within your rights to decide that this was a deal breaker, and you will be hard-pressed to be able to trust her with anything meaningful again for quite a while, if not forever.

*Practical advice:* I would suggest an abortion to your wife with the plan of working on your relationship and building a family of your own afterwards. If she doesn't go for the abortion, I would file for divorce immediately since she will be able to get you for child support in a lot of situation if you wait too long, even if it's proven to not be yours.

Best of luck. I know this situation sucks."
What sort of drug-taking paraphernalia was evident? If you didn't see anything it was probably pills.
"So do you do anything to be affectionate to him, or is it just what he can and should do to make you happy? It sounds like he's given up from constant rejection. 

This is an honest question, and not meant to attack you. Hearing both peoples actions helps us give better responses. "
"&gt; It's so hard to know.

That's your problem now, unless you find out from your husband or another way, you will *never* know.

This leaves you in the perpetual state of ""did he or didn't he"".

Where as if you hadn't shot the messenger then you could have gathered more information from them which could have either confirmed to you if they were telling the truth OR if they're just messing with you."

Yeah I agree. I really am trying to keep a good rapport with everyone here but documenting and bringing it to the president sounds about the best I can do.
"I'm not religious.  I don't go to synagogue, I don't celebrate many holidays, but that doesn't mean I condone or can accept anti-semitism, especially if it was directed at me or my family!  I don't condone racism of any kind and certainly not from a partner.

And just because OP isn't religious, it doesn't mean she definitely won't raise her kids with some knowledge of her background.

I'm not religious, but it doesn't mean I won't raise my children with some of my cultural experience.  In fact, my partner (who is a non-practicing Catholic from Latin America) is more insistent that any children we have be raised learning about their Jewish heritage.  This is because he loves and respects me, and where I come from.  I said to him at one point I'd want our kids just to have his name, that I've never liked hyphenated names as they get too long, and he insisted that our children would have both names, ""because they'd be both of us"".

There is something really wrong with the dismissive attitude that OPs fiance is showing her.  Yes, her dad is being a jerk, and yes, tensions are running high.  But her fiance is expressing some really bad behaviour that is completely unacceptable."

"Wow you are really reaching. 

It's just a fictional character from a tv show. I think you need to chill. If he thought you were really that mean and rude, he wouldn't be dating you. "
Plus the guy wouldn't let her leave until the argument was over. That's also a common abuse thing.
"It sounds like your stepdad's going off the rails and decided to listen to the really bad ideas floating around in his head. 

Give your mom a call to discuss this asap rather than waiting until she gets home. It's one of those things that even though it's disturbing, it has to do with her home life and that's more important than work. She'll want to know now. 

Calling your mom asap will also make it very clear to your stepdad that you have zero interest in shifting the relationship to anything other than it'd been up until now. Given his current thought processes, it concerns he might read into things if your mom isn't brought into the loop immediately. 

Take a deep breath and know that none of this is your fault. Your mom will be home soon - she'll probably be on the next available flight - and will handle things as she sees fit. 

If there's a friend you can go stay with, pack an overnight bag and leave the house until your mom gets home. 

Hang in there. You and your mom will get through this. "
"He's not over his wife, so you can't be in a relationship with him. He needs to grieve some more, maybe even for a couple of years before he's properly ready.

"She broke up with you because you're a selfish dick.  You're in a relationship, so you don't feel a need to arrange dates anymore? And ""I'm paying attention even if I'm not looking at you"" is generally false, and everyone knows that except for people who use that line.

She did give you a chance to fix things, and you blew that chance because of your cell phone and videogame addiction.

Better luck next time, let's hope you've learned a lesson here. Being a selfish dick kind of goes with the territory at 20 for most people, and it takes these kinds of experiences to learn to change."
Thank you :(
"I am being mean to one of her friends according to her. I'm ""just not a nice person"". Also, we've been on shaky ground lately. This might just be the straw that broke the camel's back.

"Have you ever watched Criminal Minds?
  
There's an episode called the Crossing that has a side plot about a woman who killed her husband, and her lawyer is trying to plead battered woman syndrome. The way your boyfriend talks reminds me a lot of her kids in the show. Maybe you should watch it some time, it's fictional but it's definitely not without it's support in reality."
"You should just show him this Reddit post. He needs a hard virtual shake because damn. 

I can't imagine going through what you're going through while pregnant and taking care of three kids. I'm so sorry. My thoughts are with you."
The other thing too is he exploded when she pointed out his kids with Vanessa would be going to college soon - leaving the nest. I feel like that could definitely have helped trigger it. 
The cops need to be called. Your brother is covered in bruises. 
"&gt;Don't give those fuckers any satisfaction.

We don't even know if any of this is coming from them. The sole point of the message is to find out. The exact phrasing is not important. If you think the phrasing is pathetic, suggest a better phrasing, it doesn't matter. To take her shady boyfriend's word for it out of fear of making a bad impression on 'those fuckers' is... not a great strategy, in my opinion."
I really want to start living my life the way I think is right and then I don't think I'll feel the need to hide anymore
"I'd bet my money that OP's wife said ""that sucks"" once to that person when she was going through a hard time. Payback burns."
She's 19. She cheated on her boyfriend. She's not marriage material. 
Creeper who wants to continue getting away with sexually assaulting women. 
According to OP she hasn't been paying child support.
"Keep feeding Dick. Fatter and slower, that's your goal for him."
"&gt;I met this guy on tinder

&gt;completely ghosted me

&gt;on a Saturday night and I went home with him etc

&gt; I just have no self-restraint and always end up going to his place

Ofcourse he isn't interested in you. He's not even putting in the bare minimum of social contact. He just calls and you come running to fuck him. 

&gt;How do i get myself out of this cycle?

Stop going? Get angry at this guy?

He's 33 year old, he's not dating 20 year olds for their potential. He's dating young women because he can treat them like crap and they still come running. 

What is it you want? Do you want a casual fuckbuddy? Do you want to be friends? Do you want a relationship?

"
"Bring it up again. It's something that currently is fixable.   
  
She also needs to not shame herself for having sex. Jesus. She's an adult, but she needs to start thinking like one. It's scary but honestly, there are around 3 days a month a woman can get pregnant. That's it. So if she gets on the Plan B wagon now, she can make sure she avoids anything. "
"Thank you so much for sharing your story! It's really helpful to know that someone else has gone through the same thing. I really like how you handle the follow up questions, I will keep that in mind."
"In theory this sounds like a good compromise, but I do not recommend giving your children two middle names. My legal name has two middle names and it has been a nightmare with forms and IDs and passports, etc.

Maybe the mom is the son. And the dad never existed at all. *spooky music plays* 
"Just want to point out that your ""biggest fear"" is pretty much what you want to do to this girl. 

If you've done a lot of reading, you know that HPV can be spread through oral, which you've done. You also know that it's an incredibly common STI. You also know that you can get vaccinated. So, I don't know dude, yeah break up with this woman if you're that worried about it.

Not saying you shouldn't be concerned about your sexual health, just that you might be overreacting a bit. "
"Yeah this guy doesn't seem very observant. I'm expecting a post in the future from OP that goes something along the lines of ""...The break-up with my teenaged coworker has gone sour! Help!"""
"My mom constantly would text me multiple times a day. I got her to cut down by actively not responding and only responding later. My mom's helicopters comes in more in the form of over-advice / controlling behavior like ""You have too many pillows"" and ""You can't cook that you'll hurt yourself (It's a freaking pot of noodles I'll survive) "
"You two are doomed.

You find your girlfriend, at the core of who she is, repulsive.  She does have to hide who she is from you.  You cannot expect her to stay with someone who is disgusted by her existence.

Just break up now.  She cannot change who she is and you will never accept who she is.  You're entitled to your beliefs and should find someone who feels the same way."
"this is the last time i'll adress this because you just want to shout nonsense. so here it goes, pay attention:

my ex and i had a discussion AT THE START of our relationship in which i said 'hey, i don't want kids, i don't want to be a mom'. he said 'that's fine! we won't have kids, it's okay'. we then discussed abortions and he believes that life begins at conception. i was in love with him and decided to overlook that because i can respect his belief. i didn't even pay attention because in my mind, no one was getting pregnant.

and then bam, pregnant. i cannot describe how much i didn't want a kid and how much i freaked out because i knew there'd be hell to pay. he'd try to make me not have the abortion, and i was dead set on having it. so i had it. was i wrong in not telling him? yes. but at the same time i knew i couldn't tell him. he found out by sheer dumb luck. and hell broke loose.

now, lying about something as huge as not wanting kids when you do want them is not cute nor romantic and shouldn't be put under the 'he didn't want to lose you, you monster' category. i made it very clear i didn't want to be a mother. 

i lied out of fear. he lied because he thought i'd be okay with something i told him i would never be."
"Stop making his breakfast, lunch &amp; dinner and doing his laundry. When he gets pissy tell him to get off his lazy arse and do it himself. 

And when he's complaining and being negative don't even acknowledge that he's said anything. 
Well that's what I'd do anyway."
"That's not a ""guy thing"" as much as it is an ""OP thing""."
"Yes, you are.

You are an unreasonable person with horrible - not eccentric but self-centered and demanding - grandparents who are terrible as host and hostess. You claim that being called a nancy boy or having your clothing insulted isn't bullying. It absolutely is. You claim you warned him. Did you tell him he needed his fucking three-piece suit to visit, or not?

Anyone who isn't a child has the right to go to bed whenever they please. Certainly if he was trying to turn in at 7 PM that would be one thing, but being expected to make it by on four hours of sleep and herd ostriches *while a guest at somebody's home* is ludicrous. Asking a guest to help prepare a meal or tend the garden is reasonable for people who don't have servants. Your grandparents crossed the line twice here.

You and your family are selfish and entitled if you think your behavior is at all acceptable. Your boyfriend's experience while visiting your family is absolutely your problem and if I were you I would be kissing his feet in gratitude for not running for the hills screaming.

Wake up, sister - and if you have any other eccentric relatives that your boyfriend is stupid enough to agree to meet, *outline every goddamn step* of their Stepford-smiling horrors well in advance. And more importantly, apologize to your boyfriend for bringing him into a loony bin without proper preparation."
It was in a comment she had responded to another user.
"I'd agree. I work at a pharmacy chain and we have home drug tests that range from 1 (marijuana) to 12 (heroin, meth, etc). There's one that tests 7, which includes opioids, that runs about $30-50 depending on where you are, so that's an option if you want an answer right away but don't want to drag her to a doctor either."
"If she does this, its possible that she is probably not the person to tell your life story... "
"There's a chance there were a lot of lies being told. If these people are behaving this way because of the reasons given, then the best thing to possibly do is stay far, far away from them. Usually only true trash behaves like was described, otherwise a lot of lies are in play."
Glad to see some sense here
"My god this sub...

I can't read it any more. Every single post is a girl dating a complete fucking asshole who's managed to convince them they're the one who has a problem. You've all drank from the abuse kool-aid."
"Doesn't the fact that you're thinking about divorcing your wife and the fact that everyone here is downvoting you tell you that you SHOULD change?

"&gt; Usually people move on 9/1

I was visiting Boston on 9/1 a few years ago and this AMAZED me. The streets were a mad house. Moving trucks everywhere. Furniture and other discarded things all over the sidewalks.

"These do sound like early symptoms of a psychiatric condition, even if it's possible your roommates are scanning the router traffic. If you're still feeling like you're being watched after you get a mobile data dongle then talk to someone. At that point your own judgement of your mental state is compromised"
If she's scared to abort she's only going to feel worse about the idea as she progresses into the pregnancy and maybe starts to bond with the fetus.  
I like this one better lol
"I have very few kind words for you.  You gave an extremely unfair and harsh ultimatum.  He was military when you married and you should have known what you were signing up for.  By forcing him out early you have probably cost him hundreds of thousands in retirement benefits.  You didn't use the d-word, but you told him that for all intents and purposes, he would not have a family for as long as he was active duty.  Don't pretend like you gave him a fair choice.

You are now in a highly mobile position and he's the one who has to sit at home.  He has sacrificed SO SO MUCH for your own happiness and he disgusts you?  You are a horrible, horrible spouse.  You forced him out of his career and are now unhappy he isn't the macho man you married.

You do not deserve your husband and I'm sad that he threw away a career for you.

&gt;How do you become attracted to someone who doesn't have attractive qualities?

He is a strong provider who loves you.  Loves you and his family so much that he gave up everything he had for you.  He cares for your family so you can pursue your dreams that were so important you pissed on his.  How is this not attractive?  What more could he do for you?  He's done everything you've demanded so as not to lose you and his children."

It's because abusers condition you to feel that way.
"Hank's parents deal with this constantly. They know a star seeker when they see it. 

How gross to put a teenager in the position to lie, and betray this teenager to get close to his mom.
Really, it's awful. 

Hank deserves to have friends that like him, for him. He has undoubtedly gone through this many, many times. How hard and lonely must that be for him. 

Why would your husband want Hank to go through this? Let alone how your son must feel about using this kid and being used by his own father. 

I really don't evny celebs and their families. They must be very lonely. Can't trust anyone. Ick. 

OP, please put your foot down firmly. Hank and his family are people who deserve to be treated as such. Your son should not be used like this. "
"If my husband had a flesh light, I'd probably be re-evaluating our sex life, because if he uses a toy to get off more often than we have sex, there's a problem. If any of my girl friends ever ""outed"" their husband's use of a sex toy, it'd say more about her than him 9/10 times (some girls do have issues with PIV due to health issues and if the toy keeps them both happy and sexually satisfied, more power to them, but this is a power play that won't look good on her). OP needs to realize they aren't sexually compatible and either get counseling or divorce, but honestly, I'd divorce this woman, she cares more about having control than his sexual happiness and it'll lead to SO MUCH MORE RESENTMENT. "
"She mentioned in her post that: 

&gt; He cleans and manages the maintenance of the house

Doesn't exactly sound like someone who's going to just do nothing at all. Free time is free time. If the house needs cleaning or you need groceries, it's not free time."
"Bleached - no?  I've seen some that seem to thin over time but I just assumed that was wear and tear (like frictional rubbing or something, like pants do between the legs) and didn't know it had anything to do with discharge.  That's crazy!  Thanks!"
"Practically speaking, the cost does matter. I'm not saying it has to be $16,000 or anything extravagant, but a couple hundred dollars could get you a pretty, durable gemstone and a quality, durable band that won't turn your finger green.

"This is all great advice. I would just add that, if this were me, I would just have a private wedding with me and fiance. I would not risk the mother having a tantrum at the wedding and ruining everything because she obviously needs all the attention. "
"Paying for their living expenses and maintaining their home seems like a fairly significant contribution to me.

Also, it's hard to pull the trigger on early retirement.  He also might not have been actively pursuing it but just was good at saving and sat back and realized he could do that.  Who says it has to be planned to be right?"
"Since she is totally unwilling to discuss this and you can't (and shouldn't) force the issue, you need to let it go. I think she'll gradually return to normal if you do. Without mentioning the scar, at all, or even alluding to it, maybe you could just make a point of telling her that you love her and you miss the way things you used to be?"
This. It is not a child's responsibility to protect or cover for an adult. 
Contact the police and save all the texts for evidence.

"Yeah, OP. No. 
Rip off the bandaid and end this farce. He's stringing you along and you're starting to fall for it. He was capable of mentally torturing you. He was capable of letting you go through horribly uncomfortable fertility procedures just to protect himself. He didn't just lie. He didn't just betray. He fucked you over without remorse or guilt. This is not someone you should be with. This is not someone you should have a child with. 

You are worth so much more than this bastard. There *is* someone more comparible for you. Someone who won't take your feelings and shit all over them. Someone who will gladly being and parent a child with you. 

Take a deep breath. 

Stop talking to him and stop letting him talk to you. 

Think. 

You will never, ever, trust him fully again. Ever. Some damages simply can not be fixed. 

Move on. Life has better things for you than this jack ass. "
You should make moving out a priority (don't forget that roommates are a thing). This is only going to get worse.
"Be the best dad you can be. I know it sucks that she uses that language but does her saying any of that change anything about your role in your child's life? Maybe she's saying that to make herself feel better and that whatever she's doing is more important than whatever you do. Narcissistic behavior? Just don't engage in any of that. Your child is what you should be concerned with. Keep fighting it and it's just going to be a cycle of circular arguments.

Just be a great dad and your child will appreciate it much more so than your whiny ex. That's what's important.

"God, my heart is breaking for you and those kids right now.  I can't believe how many people on here are telling you to give up and that they're not your kids. It seems like you have their best interests at heart, so please keep trying and do whatever you can to make sure they know that you love them, are there for them and would never abandon them. Sounds like you already know that and are doing it, so good luck, it looks like it's gonna be a rough ride. But those kids deserve to have a relationship with you, biology and the law aren't everything (and often are nothing considering how many kids get adopted/put foster care). Im sending you all my good vibes through the internet. Stay strong and don't give up!"
"You're married, so your income is joint now. That's how it works, normally.

You should have discussed how you would handle money before you got married. But here we are. So it's time to discuss it. Sit down and talk about income coming in and monthly expenses. Figure out what you can each spend a month. Set a budget. Stick to it. Work on getting a job so you contribute to the family income.

If you don't know anything about personal finance, the personal finance sub is a good place to start."
I hope you are on birth control. Having more kids will just prolong your prison.
"i'm not sure what 'legal access' means here. if 30 and 28 marry, and 28 is the father- 30 has zero legal rights to that kid. if 28 and OP die 30 likely would be lower on the list of possible court appointed legal guardianship than a blood relative (grandparent, aunt/uncle etc)

no matter what type of marriage situation they do, one of the men is not going to have any legal rights to the kids"
Hey cut it out with that common sense!!
"I once was emotionally abusive to my first partner, and my regret and my tears were always genuine. These subconcious patterns that lead to abuse can be really strong, and it took a lot of therapy for me to work through it. 

There are surely abusers out there that fake it - we get enough of these stories here on /r/relationships, going from tears to verbal abuse in an instant-  but for those who still feel honest regret, they might not be too far gone yet. "
"My parents are not police, they have no authority to ""do some basic verification.""

&gt;your own issues

What you call my own issues is extremely typical of abuse victims. I know it is dangerous to assess everything from individual experience, but I included my story precisely because it is so typical. I'm not by any means saying my brother is definitely guilty, or that he should be treated as definitely guilty. I'm saying that if a girl said he hit her, it's fucking serious, and needs to be treated as such"
"My advice is to ignore this asshole's snarky email.  If you *do* want to apologize, reply on the the email he sent you -- write a polite ""Dear Professor Jones, I apologize for using an incorrect email salutation.  It won't happen again. Thank you for correcting me."" and cc the department head.  But only do that if you want to start a feud.  Mostly just internalize that *professors* can be asses."

OP, you have no idea. If you think THIS is irrational, just wait until she gets going. She's got friends who are encouraging her to ""lay down the law."" Lord help you if you have any female friends (sayonara!), if any good friends you hang out with have girlfriends they bring along (adios to those people, because their girlfriends are there), if any of your models are female (lol, not anymore!) if you spend too much time with family (sorry mom/sister, there is a female friend)...dude, the list goes on and on.

"It's probably the one you're thinking of. It's nice to see that anxiety and depression are becoming less stigmatized but unfortunately there is still a lot of misconceptions about the condition I have. i have never seen media accurately portray what it's like for us. And we're always either killers or in straight jackets in the movies :/ 

I tend to find that even the people who don't ""judge"" me still tend to treat me just a little differently. The only ones who don't are my parents, my pastor and my doctor unfortunately. But I'm lucky to even have this many people who treat me normally. (:"
"**You don't fix this, your soon to be husband needs to and pronto.** When dealing with in-laws the respective spouse needs to draw the boundaries early and firmly. You can stand-up for your self too, but it's much better if the child of the in law corrects the behavior. Nothing like being potentially cut off from your child to stop stuff like that quicker.

 If he doesn't squash this now, it will only get worse. Your man needs to tell his mom to be quiet when it comes to the miscarriage. She can think whatever she wants, but any time she brings it up with you, your husband needs to rebuff your MIL. 

Have you looked up miscarriage statistics? They're very common, almost 20%! Don't let your MIL hold this over you. And more importantly don't let your fiance gloss over this. **It's great to fight your own battles, but sometimes your spouse needs to step up to the plate, man or woman.**

If he doesn't draw the line with his mom, then you need to think about being in a marriage where the MIL is going to hold sway over your lives. I'm assuming you don't want that. If he balks, that's your message to him. You will not be in a marriage controlled by your MIL."
"This definitely gets filed under ""things not to do next time."" You're not getting her back, sorry."
"Maybe you didn't mean it like this, but you didn't say meet (which is pretty neutral,) you said ""show off"" which implies bragging or that the kids are a trophy of sorts.

OP seems focused on what's good for kids, in her own way.  Claiming she wants to ""show off"" her kids at her church is a nasty way to read her motives."
"&gt;On to the issue - he doesn't do the chore unless I ask him multiple times. I hate it this way. It makes me feel bad and he too gets offended because it comes off as nagging.

So basically, he doesn't clean up and you ask him to clean up, and he still doesn't clean up, and if you ask again you're a ""nag."" Sounds like a convenient way for him to never have to clean up.

He's acting like a lazy teenager who knows mom will do his dishes if he drags his feet enough. You might want to let him know that you don't have any interest in being his mom. That is a libido- and relationship-killer."
"Hi, American who imported her Canadian husband here. 

We traveled back and forth over both borders several times before beginning the proper paperwork. Neither side had any issue with admitting us as long as we could prove we weren't entering with the intent to marry and overstay. The best way to do this is provide proof of permanency in your home country. This could be things like current pay stubs showing you're employed and expected back at work after vacation, current lease/utility bills in your name, a university class schedule, etc. We would carry those documents with our passports and it made things hella easier! 

I know it doesn't help your current situation, but may be good to know for the future. "
"I haven't seen anyone mention the binge eating in the middle of the night.  

Your wife isn't engaging in a healthy lifestyle.  It is no wonder you are bewildered.  I don't think you are being a jerk by expressing concern over this situation.  Also it is not a healthy pattern for your kids to learn. 

I'd try to focus on health--hers and your children's in any discussions.  

Also she may just now be coming out if some long term post partum depression or something similar."
Yeah MTE an actual friend wouldn't call a request for boundaries 'bullshit'
"Get married and when you get back to work say ""he's not my work-husband, he's my actual husband!!"" Then show off the ring and pictures. 

I bet people's minds would explode and since both of you guys are married, work has to allow it."
"No, I didn't.  I had a lump on my head.

And yes, I'm sure.  Listen.  I wish I were making this up.  Nothing would make me happier.  The *only* thing I can figure is that once upon a time, I ended up in a toxic workplace.  They exist.  God knows they exist.  That would have been the first instance of..... this.  Somehow maybe I internalized it and thought I deserved it and it was OK and maybe not that bad?  Maybe that did something to my personality or made me an easy target?  IDK.  That's kind of why I made this post, I'm hoping to be able to figure it out.

It happens once, you fight.  It happens twice, you fight.  It happens 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 times and *nobody cares* or worse they think it's *funny*, would you keep fighting?  Ok, maybe YOU would, maybe SOME would, but how often can you, realistically, when it doesn't get you anywhere.  

So there you are, you're 27 and somebody smashes your head into a wall, well you obviously deserved it, nobody will do anything anyway, why try.

"&gt;My wife has this idea in her head
that's already a really dismissive way to talk about her.  Not she thinks, she believes, but she ""has an idea in her head""

&gt;She claims I shoot down many of her ideas, which once again in my opinion is not true.

why do you assume your opinion on this is more valid than hers?

&gt;I constantly try to explain to her that I have an opinion on certain things and so does she

look at how many times you use the word ""explain"" in this post, as if you are the expert on her opinions as well as yours

&gt;She thinks it's my way or the highway, when I'm simply trying to explain in a calm demeanor with her 

why is your interpretation of these discussions automatically the correct one?

&gt;I tried rephrasing these quoted sentences above so she could understand that she essentially wants to clean an already clean house.

this is incredibly condescending.

Every line of this post screams disrespect of your wife's opinions."
Eggshells? Keeping you deprived of sleep? Emotional rollercoaster? Sounds like abuse to me.
"She either left him and her 1 year old to start a new life with you, or he left her and she decided to start a new life with you leaving her 1 year old behind.

"I was dating my high school  boyfriend for two years before we had sex. I have no regrets.  Don't do anything you're not comfortable with or not willing/able to deal with the consequences of.  Your sister is right. All birth control methods have failure rates even with perfect use. 

It sounds like you and your boyfriend are comfortable with things the way they are now, and you shouldn't listen to any pressure to do more than you're comfortable with.  "
"That really depends on where OP lives. Reproductive coercion is not criminalized in the US. I think it SHOULD be, but legally it's not."
"OP, I've stated this in a reply to someone but I want to say it again.

Your parents definitely messed up in not telling you the truth, they need to apologize for that, but be compassionate. Can you imagine how hard a conversation that would be to have, considering your biological mom is your sister? That's not an excuse for not telling you, they should have grit their teeth and done it, but they didn't keep it from you out of spite. They're your parents, they love you.


B. No matter what I say, I'm sure you're going to meet with this guy anyways. But let me give you some tips as someone who has been there and has had friends who've been there, and let me share some things we've found out.

 This is not a good man. 

Even if we were to give him the benefit of the doubt and say he regrets running off when your sister was pregnant and didn't know how to come back, let's look at some of these red flags.

1. He's been literally stalking you. He has people fucking **spying on you** without your knowledge or anyone else's knowledge. That's not just ""I've read your facebook"" that's ""I know where you are at almost any given time."" This man is a stranger to you and is already displaying that he has no fucks to give about your privacy or personal space.


2. ""Friends in high places"" is a red flag in and of itself. It's both there to boost your esteem of him, his own ego, and quite frankly it's a low grade threat to your family. You don't tell someone you have friends in high places for no reason. He most likely wants you to show that to your parents so that they get worried about these friends who have, and I can't stress this enough, **been stalking you.** This shows that his concern isn't about you, it's about the fact that in his mind, you're something that rightfully belongs to him. This is so fucking creepy.



3. The way he talks about your family vs himself.

&gt;Your family will tell you to delete your Facebook page and all other contact info. They tell you this because they still want to hide you from me as I have never seen you in person. I have nothing to hide from you and only the truth to offer.

This isn't a man who regrets his decision to abandon you, this is a man who feels entitled to your attention and love. Someone who genuinely cared about YOU and was a decent person would be so fucking grateful that their biological kid had a great life and a family that loved them, not talking about them like they were in some fucking conspiracy against you. Yes, your family did fuck up by not telling you, but it wasn't malicious. The wording this guy is using is designed to manipulate you into feeling like you were kept in the dark for some cruel reason. You weren't. They messed up and never figured out the right time. He wants you to feel like this was a malicious lie, and juxtaposes that with ""I have nothing to hide from you and only the truth to offer"" like he's some benign figure here to grace you with the truth, like he's done nothing wrong and is sweet and perfect and innocent. He is not. He abandoned you as a baby and made no attempts to have custody of you or visitation or anything. Sure, he was 17, but you know what a good man would say? They'd admit they fucked up. They'd admit they made a mistake and would hope that you forgave them. They wouldn't act like some innocent bringer of truth here to light your way out of darkness and deception. The fact that he's acting like he's the victim of your family is a huge red flag, he'd rather drive a wedge between you and them instead of make some sort of amends for your sake.



OP, please when you meet with him do it in the day in a public place. I've had one adoptee friend literally have to call the cops because she made the mistake of meeting her bio dad at his house and he tried to physically prevent her from leaving. The rest of us who got facebook messages from our bio dads that sounded pretty much exactly like what you got (there's 4 of us, while that might not be a significant sample size, it's still a sort of damning pattern) we've all ended up regretting letting these men into our lives. They are pushy. They are demanding. They are hell to get rid of. They're not good people, and they talk shit on our families. Oh, they love you. They love that they made you. They don't really care about you beyond being an extension of them, and they think they have any say in your life or who you are, and they try to guilt you into meeting their families whether or not your ready for it (usually by lying to you until it's too late to back out) and they want you to be in debt to them. They're emotionally abusive, and they'll harass your family. In my case, it turned out that my bio dad DID want to keep me. The reason he couldn't? He drugged me several times as a baby to get me to fall asleep and would suffocate me because he thought it was funny. That is potentially the kind of man you're dealing with.

Out of all my adoptee friends, there is only one time where the bio dad contacting them turned out well. Great, actually. The man had been a serious druggie when his son was taken away, his son was adopted by my aunt. When my cousin was 16, the man contacted my aunt, told her he was sober and was grateful to her for what she had done for ""Zack"". Their relationship slowly built, he never talked bad about my aunt, respected all of us, and just wanted the best for Zack and, most importantly, he owned up to the fact that he had fucked up and never tried to hide that.

Just please be careful, OP, and don't let some smooth talking dick drive a wedge between you and your real family. "
I think you should speak to a therapist because this sounds quite unhealthy.
"What if he'd killed the kid? Worth divorcing over then? Because he easily could have - that time, or the next... If I was the wife, I sure as hell wouldn't be waiting around for the next time. 'Being committed to your marriage and family' means your children's safety comes first."
"It drove you mad because you were imagining she had feelings for you. You were thinking, ""How can this woman I'm in love with treat me so poorly, and expect me to keep loving her? It's so unreasonable of her!"" But she never demanded feelings from you. She doesn't care about you at all.

If a person cancels without notice, it shows they don't care. Or that they're really bad at social skills. You don't let it drive you mad, you just realize they don't want to be friends, and you stop hanging out with them."
"&gt; I was raised SDA by the way. Chances are damn good you won't be sharing a bedroom.

Can confirm.  Was also raised SDA.  "
"I don't like the word ""retaliatory"" here, it makes him sounds really aggressive. It doesn't sound like he's saying ""I'll show her!"" To me it sounds like he used to have the attitude of ""In sexual matters, sometimes you should move away from your own preferences if it's something your partner really wants"" and now he's thinking ""Wait, am I the only one moving outside my comfort zone to please my partner? Well, that's not cool. Enough."""
"My dad had a 70's era Cutlass Supreme. I loved that car. Women who judge men by their car are stupid, and since I'm a woman, it's ok for me to say that."
"It sounded like things were really awkward after she rejected him. Often, when women have to reject male friends, they pull away for a while because they think that perhaps the guy got the wrong idea because she was too friendly to him. She didn't want to lead him on. How should she have acted? Imagine if she had acted the same as before. He would have assumed she was interested in him but playing hard to get or stringing him along for ego boosts. 

Her options:

1) Act the same as before: Come across as the asshole who is stringing him along for ego boosts 

2) Act more aloof (like she did) but try to preserve the friendship: Come across as ""difficult""

3) Cut him off completely: Come across as the Ice Queen.

Really, it's a damned if you do; damned if you don't situation."
"&gt; What about saying she wants to shake me? 

That's just a common, exaggerated, phrase.   
It's highly unlikely she actually wants to shake you.  "
"yeah. . you have no idea how messed up this is.  I am not talking about the age, but the level of deception you are going through with your parents. 

maybe they are not the best, maybe overly religious, controlling or something. . but hiding your BF for four years is not the foundation for a healthy future together.   "

"&gt; if my girlfriend who has a high sex drive, is open about sex and different things, tells me she doesn't like anal and then goes and watch videos of girls being strapped and forced to orgasm while having anal, what am i supposed to think and feel?

You're supposed to think that she doesn't like anal, but does like watching videos of it.  Why is that complicated?"
"Dude why are you being so aggressive? 

Your original comment was actually insightful and made me think about my own views despite me initially disagreeing with it. But your aggressive replies disappoint me.

u/tacofarmerxd was just asking an innocent question, and she was really respectful of your response even though you blew up at her. You then respond by mocking her further. Can we just be play nice?"
"Clearly she's using you for financial security while still being in love AND GOING ON DATES with her ex. 

Dump her"
"So, your assault was all about him, and his hurt feelings, and it's your responsibility to make him feel better about your rape.

"your brother has been looking at CHILD PORN

CALL THE FUCKING COPS

I DONT CARE HOW BAD IT DECIMATES YOUR APATHETIC ASS FAMILY YOUR BROTHER CAN ONLY ESCALATE FROM THAT POINT ONWARDS!!!!!"
"He knows he's being manipulative. That 10 years isn't a blank canvas; he has way more experience than you in life and relationships. 

Even if he's ""unwittingly controlling"", that shows that he's not a trusting person nor is he empathetic to you. He is probably not a nice person at heart. 

You are not responsible for teaching him to be a good person. He's a 30s adult. If he wanted to change for the better, he either would have or should already be on that track. You are not his mother."
"I would tell her what he says, does, or thinks is out of her control. And it's not her responsibility. Trying to get other people to feel a certain way rarely ever works out. I would also explain that health needs have to be fulfilled, and that many other areas in her life will suffer until that issue is resolved."
"He mentions afterward that her pants were ripped, which seems like a pretty solid reason for not wearing them.

I mean, if she did cheat, wouldn't she wear the pants back instead of appearing in her underwear (assuming they didn't get ripped during sexytimes)?"
"I know, Right!? 

The doggie BUMPED her. That isn't aggression, that's code for ""play with me!!!"".

I'm sure she would want my neighbor's dog put down as well. He has nipped me while playing fetch because he jumps to get the stick in my hand and misses, or decides to rough house a bit and gets a little too excited.  When he does it on purpose, I say ""no"", drop the stick, turn around, and ignore him. He then calms down enough to start playing again (he is 1/2 chocolate lab 1/2 hunting dog, so he literally will play fetch until your arm falls off. Then he woukd probaby want you to throw that, too lol!)

Can you imagine if she owned a cat?!?!? They bump you constantly, make biscuits all over your body, attempt to eat your hair, and scratch the ever living piss out of you while scaling you like a tree....out of love."
"It sounds like they have talked about it, and she's been honest and upfront about her sexual boundaries: 

&gt;  She has stated that she will never do it in the future as we've tried before but she's just never been a fan.

Now OP needs to be equally honest and stop stringing along a woman he doesn't see a future with. Sexual incompatibility is generally not something people can ""fix"" because it isn't something that's broken. They just want different things."
"This is my first ever comment, because I see so much of myself in you. I'm 33F, and within the last couple of years, for the first time in my life, I FINALLY found my ""CHOSEN FAMILY"". I'm also an activity planner, outgoing, networker, ""party mom"", connecting new people.. I totally get where you're coming from. It sucks to have to ""Change the guard"" every couple of years, but they do sound like shitty people. You'll get there. You'll find your folks. 

To echo what a few other commenters said, finding people who are secure in themselves goes a LONG way, and truly these people exist, and even in your own age group. But it comes at different speeds for different people. Just keep being your kind self, and don't take what others do or say to undermine that to heart. "
"She doesn't want to be married to you, you can't just refuse to accept the legal documentation and force her to stay in this marriage. If she's seeking a divorce, she will get one, she doesn't need your permission or your cooperation."
"Call her anyway. Borrow someone else's phone. Consider this the exchange for free room and board.

Or borrow a cable."
"This seems likely.  The giveaway is that it is a pattern of repeated behavior that is seemingly out of character for her otherwise.  She is most likely intentionally sabotaging her friendships with these people for a reason.  The fact that she doesn't recognize how her past behavior isn't connected to her current situation is another indicator that this is an far deeper issue than her just being a shitty friend.  Don't get me wrong, she's a shitty friend, but like you I suspect much deeper issues."
Uh. Making a derp face or blinking is human nature. Blocking the photographer with your cell phone is completely inconsiderate AND ignorant to the couple's request to NOT do so.
"Well, they had a problem with it enough to put up signs and the groom publicly requesting it beforehand.  During a wedding everything happens fast and their attention was stolen after by a thousand other things and left the professionals to the photos.

With the photographers being in their 20's I think they must be a tad inexperienced.  They had enough to work with but I'd be pretty annoyed too as the bride or groom.  Not passive aggressive notes and reject photos annoyed but they requested something and guests didn't feel the rules applied to them.  People don't hire photographers to photograph people photographing people.  Nobody wants to spend that kind of money on that to see people on their phones."
I disagree. Last place I worked had about 6000 employees. When you walked into the main reception there was the board room and another minor meeting room and... dun dun dun... the CEO's office. They usually are near reception because they take so many meetings. Wouldn't make sense to trot visitors through the whole office to meet the big kahuna.

"I am not familiar with Bachata, but the first few YouTube results (which I would link if not for the rules of this sub) show a dance where the dancers' hips are *very* close to each other, to the point where each dancer is literally straddling their partner's leg.  It does not seem unreasonable to me to be uncomfortable with your SO dancing like this with other people.
&gt;It's not the dance. It's you you're the problem.

Regardless of what you think is okay, OP is allowed to decide on his own boundaries for his relationship.  That said, I agree that OP's inappropriate erection is probably influencing his feelings.  He should definitely talk to his wife."
"&gt; Do you really think a reasonable person would expect that a man posting shirtless selfies on Instagram run it by his wife first?

Yes?  If the account was secret and the sole purpose of it was to get validation from women?  ABSOLUTELY"
"Yeah this might not be a racism thing. He could not like the idea of not knowing what is daughter is saying or he might be worried that his daughter is closer to the nanny than she is to him and is getting upset about it. OP needs to find out why he said this first, and then address the issue."
"It's not wrong to be upset, but I'm sure he was just making a joke. It's a stereotype that men are afraid of commitment, and he was playing along with that.

You should have a relationship in which you are both comfortable expressing how things make you feel, and if you calmly tell him how you feel, I'm sure he'll understand. If he doesn't, probably a good idea NOT to marry him anyway."
"Maybe he should have said that and used his words instead of calling her needy.

Perhaps OP is quick to jump the gun but she's right to feel hurt. But if her boyfriend has personal reasons for not taking her, he should actually say them and not call her needy which clearly made it worse."
"Well to be fair--you broke up. It sucks to see your ex move on so quickly, but it's not your concern anymore; that seems harsh, but it's true. I would suggest going completely no contact for a while so you can really have time apart to heal. Why torture yourself with watching her date someone else?

It's possible to be friends, but it is not possible for that change to happen over night. You have a lot of fresh hurt and feelings still involved and you'll just be stuck in a weird limbo of being emotionally attached to each other but not together.

I dated again right away after my ex of six years broke up with me, but I was really emotionally fucked up and was basically looking for anyone ANYONE to validate my feelings and make me feel wanted. I'm not saying it was right, but that was what I did."
"If you told me your grandpa (who had invited me to a formal dinner party in a house with a full staff) was traditional about gendered chores and they were big on family time and don't like electronics, I'd be thinking I might be expected to carve the roast, and there would be conversation after dinner and no TV or checking of phones. I would *not* be expecting dawn ostriches, mandatory drunk shooting expeditions and being held hostage around the piano until 2am. Particularly if I was going to be dragged out of bed at 5am to wrangle livestock!

That's not just eccentricity, it's your grandparents being *really terrible hosts*, and you should definitely be a lot more specific next time you take someone along."

"Yeah, I don't think your mom knows what the word racist means. And it's sort of ironic that she ""feels like she needs to help the world"" but can't adequately look after her own son. 

I think your brother moving to live with your dad sounds like the best idea for everyone. You should call him ASAP. In fact, if your mom decided she wanted to abandon your brother, the fact that she drove him to your dorm and presumably didn't even speak to your dad or take him there is just another red flag about her unreasonableness. And even if your dad's busy and works long hours, your brother is 13, not 3 and he sounds like he is level-headed and mature, so I'd imagine it's not going to be a huge burden for your dad to look after him, and anyway, he's his dad, that's what parents (non-crazy ones) are for! Good luck."

The instinct to protect the mother can go two ways; protect her from devastation, or protect her from possible STDs (which probably wasn't a thought OP had considering it was her boyfriend).  The instinct to protect her parents can split off into two ways, to her step dad (my step dad is my father, plain and simple) and to her mother.  She's been forced into a complex situation and the right thing to do is tell her mother, but that's not an easy conclusion to come to knowing everything else that follows."
"Hugs. Make sure that Lilly is completely blocked on everything. If Dan is still in contact with her then make it clear that he is not to give her any info about you and he is not to try and pass messages to you for her.

Can I point out the original wedding was INCREDIBLY inexpensive. She may be playing copycat to attempt keeping her budget as low as possible. Its not exactly unexpected to ask if you can get the same deals. She may not realize how much was actually because it was a *gift* from a close friend.

You are sick, you partner should be supporting you when you are sick, not bailing on you. He is showing his true colors under pressure. If it wasn't this, it would have been something else later on. It's easy to be the perfect partner when everything in life is going smoothly. But life isn't all sunshine. If you ever had a serious accident, or got some other illness, you just found out he wouldn't have your back he would drop you in a minute because it's too hard for him to deal with."
"It's pretty common honestly that you don't want to hear about your current SO's past sexual relationship all the time.

"&gt; She told me that he took no responsibility for his behaviors and actions, quickly co-opted her therapist's vocabulary in speaking with her to tell her what he thought she wanted to hear, and she concluded that he was displaying aspects of anti-social disorder, but saying that was wrong on her part and unprofessional, since they don't diagnose kids with those types of personality disorders when they're minors.

So he's a sociopath but they won't label him with that because he's under 18."

"&gt; She could have also visit healthcare facilities to find out more about her sickness in the last 10+ years.

Did you read OP's account of her medical history?  Not all healthcare facilities are created equal.  And if this disease is really rare, it's entirely possible that even a doctor who didn't just blow her off with ""it's probably depression"" could've seen her and not known what he was looking at.

Please remember that there are TWO innocent parties here. The kid and the father. The only arsehole is the mother."

"&gt; it seems like she is feeling like someone who just feels like they gave another person a new car and having them say it's great but too bad it wasn't another color.

I disagree, mostly because of this part:

&gt; Since then, my wife has been talking about how lucky I am for having a wife that is up for threesomes up to have sex whenever I want. 

It sounds like wife believes that all men, including OP, are sex-crazed maniacs who want sex 100% of the time and would do it 1000 times a day if they were able. But since OP (along with most other guys) isn't like that and isn't shouting from the rooftops that he has an amazing wife who gives him threesomes and has sex whenever he wants, she's taking it as a personal insult (""if all guys (OP included) are sex crazed maniacs, the only reason he's not shouting from the rooftops about me must be because I'm ugly/it was shitty/he's not attracted to me anymore/a litany of other illogical thoughts"") and is upset that he's not taking out full-page ads in newspapers to broadcast how lucky he is to *finally* be getting his sexual needs fulfilled (in her mind, remember).

I think OP needs to explain this stuff to her:

&gt; I told her that I do appreciate it, but I am not wound up as I was with sex when I was younger. When I was in my late teens/early 20s, having a threesome would have been an amazing confidence builder, just having it to brag to my friends, etc.

In more detail. That, while he enjoyed himself, due to his declining libido as he's aged, he doesn't think about sex for every waking minute and his thought processes no longer revolve around how to get laid. He values the emotional connection he has with his wife but the physical act of sex is no longer Earth-shattering. "
"Holy shit, that guy's an idiot.

Good for you, OP. Best of luck in the future."

"Why do your friends still hang out with this awful woman??

I get the feeling she's going to show up at your wedding - invited or not. If you're working with a coordinator, tell them. At the very least, tell the venue: give them a photo of her and tell them that she is not to be let in! Have someone on duty greeting arriving guests, who can call security/the police if she shows up.

When she quizzes you about the wedding, tell her you're tired of planning and don't want to talk about it, and get away from her. I would actively ignore her in social situations if I were you."
"Ever heard the phrase defining moment?  

This was his defining moment.  If you stick it out he'll do something else, but it won't just impact you, it will impact your child.  If you leave now he'll be out of your life forever.  if you wait until you have a child with him, he'll be in your life forever.

Remove him from your life."
"She may remember when the time comes, even if she never comes to you. It's not a wasted effort. Good on you for trying. "
"My ex (who coincidentally was the same type of ~always mad at me for random things and convinced I was useless and lazy and the source of all his problems~ as OP's ex) did EXACTLY the same thing. I legitimately laughed in his face! I think it was because if I had sex with him again he could convince himself that he was still pretty awesome and I secretly wanted to be with him still (and yes, feeling like he was still The Man In Charge), rather than having to deal with the fact that I literally never wanted to see his face again."
"in the ridiculously dramatic, calculated, humiliating way that OP did it? absolutely fucking not. that's not how normal people behave.

the way you exact your pound of flesh when you're wronged says a lot about the kind of person you are."
Do you want your girlfriend scrutinizing the title of every porn video YOU watch? You want to open that Pandora's Box?
How about because it's private?
"Yeah, OP's husband is setting their son up for social failure. "
Christ that is embarrassing. Your 'right social group' has to depend on their parents in order to support the lifestyle they have? Grown ass adults with children that rely on their aging parents prudent financial decisions in order to live in the 'right' neighborhood. I bet your financially illiterate self fits right at in with them... 
"All true. OP, why not join them for the recovery portion of their rides or runs, or do your own thing and meet them at a predetermined destination like a coffee shop? I've been the only lady on a team of bike racers, and a few girlfriends have done this to show support and be a part of all the crazy training required. It's really appreciated by the guys AND the lone lady who probably misses girl talk very much (its crucial,  especially when you're training so hard). "
"You know what? If this guy was worth dating, his response should have been ""you're the hottest girl I ever dated"" even if you are not at all attractive. Because he should still find you attractive. I'm sure you can do better than this guy. Not worth your time. "

It can make us a wee bit miffed.
"I appreciate your thoughtful response. She wasn't years supportive of my depression. This was easily within the first few months of our marriage. My depression was never severe or debilitating. But any depression, any expression of a low mood was met with panic and anger. So I shut up about it. 

I don't compare her to my mother. Or didn't. Until I started thinking about it just now. At least not consciously. But it's something to consider more actively.

I am genuinely surprised when she's tender and loving. It makes me question things. Like if there's a spark there, then can it be nurtured? 

Am I a narcissist? My therapist suggested that if I'm asking about it, and concerned that I may be, then I'm probably not. I have no idea.

She's probably not a narcissist, right? I'm probably projecting. Yet, I still think I can't be wrong literally all the time. Can a person really be so screwed up that they are misperceiving every emotional interaction? If so, then this really is all my fault, and I'm the monster for putting her through a living hell all these years. But I don't want to believe that it's really all my fault and that I'm really the abusive one. Nobody wants to be the villain of their own story.

I'm paralyzed. I don't know what to do."
"I think it is quite reasonable to wonder what else somebody would lie about out of fear or convenience.  Just because this is in regards to sex and orgasms doesn't mean lying it suddenly acceptable. We've seen so many posts about ""My SO lies about inconsequential things all the time, should I be upset?"" And of course people suggest that the SO feels lying is acceptable in order to avoid the hard conversations.  So this is quite important because tough conversations occur often in relationships, and you can't avoid them! "
"I don't think that's it. OP wouldn't've gotten to the point of talking to 23 women if he wasn't at least decently attractive because of the way Tinder works. At least, it's my understanding that you can only communicate when both parties ""like"" each other."
"Sometimes people have sex in an effort to numb emotional pain they are feeling, not just because they are dick loving whores who don't care about anyone. "
I agree. Waste of time.
"Well, you know.  

*Healthy*.  

I'm really not interested, sexually, in anyone other than her.  I guess that's not healthy, maybe.  Because you can end up in a situation like this.  Where your own continued mental health and ego--already battered by 4 years of near abstinence--finally faces the long drop.

"
"This isn't a marijuana problem, this is an asshole problem. Your husband has trained you with tantrums, like a 3 year old child. If you bring up topics he doesn't want, he'll make your life hell until you drop it. That is not an acceptable behaviour in any kind of relationship, much less a romantic one."
Thank you for this. I am glad I am not crazy to think that the name is bad. 
"You won't put up with what? Christ, get a fucking  life!"
And in some ways it sounds like it was even worse for alex. It seemed like he had to normaly work at home and coudlnt even leave the house besides odd times when someone would come to relive him. Doing that for a extended period of times got to crush you.
Twist: OP wrote the ice cubes article for him.
"I don't know why you're being down voted. As a parent, your kid is one of the most important people in your life. 

Like you said, I'm not asking them to be a part of their lives, but if they don't care about me enough to just meet the person who means the most to me, then obviously we're on different pages and not the friends I thought we were. "
"&gt; My wife and I discussed everything before she moved. I told her, point blank, that she would not have the same job opportunities as she did in the US.

So what? Now she has experienced it she has realised she cant handle it.  And that's OK and legitimate.  She isnt bound to persist in misery forever because she once agreed to give it a try.


&gt; I don't know if you're incredibly young or incredibly naive or both, but happiness isn't served to you on a silver platter as soon as you snap your fingers. Sometimes you have to actually work for it, go outside your comfort zone, try to find the silver lining.

I'm 32 and married for many years.  I agree happiness is something you work at.  But the thing you arent willing to accept is that everyone, literally everyone, has some specific aspects of their life that they cannot be happy without - something or things core to their identity.  For many people this is a challenging job, for others its being a parent, for others its even a specific hobby or lifestyle.  No number of consolation prizes (receptionist job, gardening club, volleyball, swim club) add up to something that is core to a person's identity.  No amount of effort directed at them will overcome this impediment to happiness.  You dont seem to get this.  You seem to think if she just applies herself to meaningless fripperies then she can become happy and fulfilled even without those aspects she holds core to her identity.  This is the empathy failure everyone is highlighting.

&gt; At the end of the day, it is her life. All I can do is offer suggestions.

WRONG. You can take into account what she is saying (she wants a challenging job for example) and make compromises to help her acheive it - like moving closer to London or wherever she could work in her field.

Or you can accept the inevitable dissolution of your marriage as she succumbs to resentment at your selfish and patronising double-standard.

"I don't think people are suggesting paranoia because this is out of the realm of possibility to them. I'm sure technically these things could be done, but why? What possible reason would these people have for monitoring his internet activity and occasionally kicking him off the internet? It's just that without motive it's a bizarre thing to do, and it sounds a lot like paranoia."
"My partner is eight years younger than yours and would never respond the way Art has. My partner would be happy that I am making friends in a new place, and probably suggest we invite Noodle over some time once we are ready to make our relationship public with the group. And he might make a couple jokes about Noodle having a crush, but it would never present as anger at either of us. Because, again, neither you or Noodle did anything wrong. 

Your boyfriend has a lot to work on. And honestly, at 35 he should have a handle on this shit already. "
"No no no no, abort. This guy is a very bad investment. I did what your bf is suggesting with my then-bf a couple years ago, took on more of the living expenses while he paid for his schooling. That worked out great for us because my bf had always been an awesome student, was going to grad school for a specific degree with a long-term plan for future employment, and had the same financial values as myself  (frugal living, not spending more than necessary).

Your bf, on the other hand, has shown he doesn't really care about school, about spending other people's money, about living within his own means.

Do NOT live with him. Even if you agree to a 50/50 split, I guarantee you will be paying more. If he's not able to afford the utility bill one month, for example, are you going to go without electricity? Nope, you'll just pay it. If he's only able to pay for rice and beans, are you going to go hungry? No, you'll just pay for take-out. This is what he's planning on. Do not do not do not do this."
Part of being secure is not letting people shit on you. An insecure person let's people hurt them without holding them responsible.
Depends where they are whether it's illegal; no matter where they are it's still fucking disgusting.
I personally would take this as a red flag. Sexual incompatibility for sure. Not to mention it takes all the fun out of sex! 
There are therapists who specialize in prepubescent violence. Tel your parents they either find one NOW or the juvenile justice system will likely take care of it for them in a few years.
Hahah like a soothing diesel tractor
This is a perfect response!!!! Great idea
"I agree with you to some extent. Getting blackout hammered should be a rare thing for adult people. By 25, you need to be able to have some drinks without getting schnockered every time you go out.

However, I do think that most people who cheat while drunk would cheat anyway. For myself and many friends &amp; acquaintances, getting drunk does not equal having sex with randoms. If someone is the sort of person who just might want to have sex with randoms sober though, getting drunk suddenly makes that outcome much more likely. For me, I've been in a relationship for 6 years. If I woke up after a night of drinking with a group of people (without my BF) and found out that I had ""had sex"" with some guy--""friend,"" acquaintance, stranger, whatever--while wasted, I'd be going to the police, because I got raped. I've been drunk off my ass a multitude of times, both in a relationship and single, and the worst thing I do is throw up and then go to sleep. I do not initiate sex with people besides my BF when drunk, and not even him if I'm super drunk. I do not get horny. My body is like ""fuck I am poison"" and then my consciousness shuts off and I sleep. 

So if his GF is not the type to cheat, adding drinking to the mix will not make her cheat. It may make her easier to take advantage of, however. "
"Well now that I think about it, I don't think any man I've been intimate with had had reason to look at that part of my panties. If they ever put their hands down my pants they probably thought the goo on the back of their hands was me being wet. Wow. I never considered this honestly so it's really surprising that so many men probably have no idea...."
"Yes! Sometimes my SO will try to be coy and reach between my legs to stroke the outside of my panties, and I'm like *cringe* ""I'm wearing a liner."" So unsexy."

"The last part I disagree with. Trust me, I've got conservative parents and if I was pregnant and considered an abortion for the tiniest nanosecond, they would be almost as devastated as if I'd actually had one. OP's parents are the same way."
"People suck, I guess. These dudes must be pretty fucking insecure to do this shit.


I'm just getting back into dating after years of a relationship and I didn't get it at all, I thought it was pretty rude to just ignore me after I'm putting myself out there, but alas."
"OP, do you like having friends at all? God forbid you meet any cool bisexuals. Or your straight women friends have male friends they like to hang out with. Etc. 

It won't end here."
"Hey man, 

I don't have great advice, but I would come up with a script along the lines of ""You don't have to like what I'm saying when I say that my father was abusive. I have to live with my past, and that is part of it. I will not pretend it was otherwise, so if that is the narrative you'd rather follow, then we may have to continue our stories separately.""  Or something to that effect. Don't allow enablers or abusers to be in your life. Shit's too short. "
"This is honestly the most logical thing. His boss is not going to remember OP's name if she ever did apply for a job there. It doesn't seem like it would be immediate and I'm sure these people actually meet and are introduced to *so* many people day in and day out that even if he did lie to make himself feel better about getting rejected, no one will remember her name or know what she looks like by the time it would matter for her getting a job."
"Honestly, if I were you I would tell him. Just tell your side of the story, you met this guy, went home with him, he gave you his phone number... you were curious and looked on facebook. If you want to avoid drama you can create a separate account with a fake name.

Obviously you are bothered by this, and you did absolutely nothing wrong. It's on him. 

Yes, it's possible that they recently broke up, or are in an open relationship. However, more than likely he has been cheating on her, and his gf deserves to know. If they are broken up or in an open relationship, telling her won't hurt their relationship. "
"It is also possible that they have been seeing each other for longer, and kept it from you before they were sure it has some serious potential. Otherwise a moth really does seem a bit too soon. You should try talking to your mum a bit more about it, try and be understanding for her but also insist that she is understanding of you, too. 

EDIT: month, not moth. That would have been just weird. "
"OP, everyone on this thread wants you to succeed. But this is not about ""proving your parents wrong."" They have some very practical concerns that you shouldn't just write off. There are thousands and thousands of kids in the US who ""want to be directors"" and go to school, get $100k in debt, and end up starting from square 1 at age 30, 35, or 40. Your goal is to avoid being one of those people.

How do you plan on becoming a director? Going to film school is only a tentative first step; the hard work is all after that. Hollywood won't just show up to your school and be like, ""Leonitus DiCatrio, please direct for us so we can give you lots of money."" What is your plan for dealing with the inevitable rejection and how will you get by, after graduation, while you're pursuing your dream?"
"Right?! Not only is he ungrateful about the car itself, but how mean of him to treat his sisters that way when they went out of their way (and deep into their pockets) to get him about the most thoughtful gift ever. What a total jackass. I could never forgive him for that. "
Is it more important to have the one on one with an old girl friend or compromise and bring Jen with/make your fiancee happy? You could catch up on the past with a phone call before lunch if you're that worried about Jen feeling left out.
"Not enough evidence to incriminate her. 

Take a screenshots of the message. 

Wait a few days after she comes back...then log into her facebook account, if that message has been deleted or she changes her FB pw then you should say something to her since she clearly did it to cover her tracks.

Also if you can, before you start acting suspicious around her, try to access her phone and look for other messaging apps more info maybe there. 

good luck man.
"
"Yes, he has cousins stay with him frequently but never without at least a few days notice. "
"When you get married your spouse become your primary family. You fight for them and defend them. 

They come first. Always. 

Yes, you fucked up majorly. "
"... What? None of this logically follows, at all. Are there any other red flags in the relationship?

I suppose you could send him your testing results showing that you are HIV negative and the autoimmune diagnosis, if he refuses to communicate any way other than text. Honestly though, do you want to stay with someone who is willfully ignorant, immediately ready to suspect you of cheating, and has such horrible problem resolution skills?"
"It's fucked. 

Families can get really hung up on keeping people in roles. For example, my parents decided that I was the smart one, and my sister was the pretty one. Which fucked me up because they put a load of pressure on me to perform, but no support and now I'm a depressive mess. And my sister got fucked up because all her life she got the message she wasn't smart. But she got herself sorted out, went back to school and is now a radiographer. 
So. 

Best bet is to not start a fight, but to be restrained but clear that you think your gf is the best looking woman in th room. Sister's probably dealing with her own issues and might feel that if she can't feel smart, she can at least feel pretty.
"
To the left to the left!
"&gt; On the flip side, my atheist boyfriend was raised Catholic, and has serious issues because of all the guilt he was raised with. Like, panics if we go near a church, is in therapy, kind of issues. 

Sounds like this is the bigger issue since OP mentioned this:

&gt;He had a bad experience with the Catholic church as a child, and thinks that everything is going to be about guilt and a vengeful god. Trying to explain that no, my denomination (Episcopalians) don't do that, and hey - we also believe in science! - is hard.

OP's BF was probably traumatized or at least deeply troubled by his childhood experiences with religion, and even though he knows OP's religion isn't the same way, there's still that underlying fear and disgust for what organized religion did to his mental well-being growing up. Like, even though he knows the messages are different, that environment of being in a church with people telling you you're going to hell or being watched for XYZ might be enough to make him balk at thinking his kids might go through the same thing. And OP, even though you put ""indoctrination"" in quotes, he's not wrong. It *is* religious indoctrination to raise children, starting from a young age, to think a certain way about life and spirituality. Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing is up to context and situation."
"Then you break up with her first, *then* suggest the threesome. It's completely unfair to initiate a sexual encounter with someone who isn't in possession of the full facts (in this case that you intend to end the relationship afterwards).

If you think she'll say no after you've broken up with her? Then the answer is no."
"Don't address your decision on social media for God's sake. It's no one else's business. Just block everyone you need to, and block new accounts as they come up."
"I know it doesn't help with the mental trauma of it all, but there is such a thing as scar revision surgery.  It may be an option you mum might want to look into.  It could make the scar smaller and less visible.  At least then, she doesn't have that reminder every time she looks in a mirror."
"Thanks for the reply.

Bio-mom doesn't have custody, just visitation once a month. He goes to her city one weekend every month. She's on board with him living with us, and has offered to pay a small share of rent.

I don't think I communicated my concerns well in the OP. My concerns are definitely selfish ones. My concern with her making a fuss on social media is that Rick and I have just forged a reputation in a very technical field, and we dropped out of college to get where we are. I just don't want her to ruin that."
Why don't you tell your current bf that they are harassing you? Or does he know?
"I wouldn't say it's alright because it isnt. If they didnt want you to come to game nights, they shpuld have handled it like adults, and told you the group size was too big, or whatever the reason was. I'd ignore the texts unless they send you something worth responding to"
"&gt;Tell your boyfriend to stop being such a baby.

FYI: this has a 0% chance of making the situation better and almost 100% chance of making the situation worse. Worst advice in the thread."
"You told him he'd be insulted if he ""disobeyed""? But don't worry honey, just ""be yourself""?"
"I would contact him if I were you, there's a possibility that it could vastly improve your situation if you contact him. It might actually be one of the best decisions you've ever made in your life, if it turns out he wants to help, which is what ""dads"" are supposed to do - even if they aren't in regular contact with you, it's possible he'll help you, you're his son.

don't listen to your grandparents or people like that. go call your dad, or send him an email explaining the situation if you aren't able to call him, or contact him in some way, yes. Explain to him what you explained to us. Sorry you have found yourself in this situation and your mom's family was like that. I wish I had a bunch of extra money so I could send you some, maybe some redditor will so you don't have to worry about having enough money for the next few months until you get this stuff sorted out. People want to help, you just have to give them a chance to by asking for help.

if I were your dad I would be extremely unhappy if you *didn't* contact me and I didn't get the chance to help you through this. Hopefully your dad will feel the same way. He might have been told the same thing you were told, ""they don't want anything to do with him and he's not allowed to contact you or your mother ever again"". It's a scary situation to be in but things will improve for you in your life, it won't always be like it is now.

you won't be hurting him or his family (which you are too) by contacting him.  just explain the situation to him the same way you did here, tell him your situation and that you don't have anyone else to ask for help. people will help you on reddit if you're going to run out of money to eat, make a post on /r/personalfinance about your situation and ask them if there are any emergency services you can get food or financial assistance from, and chances are good some kind redditor will give you some money -- they will also have an endless supply of other good advice about what you should do in this situation."
"So, is his money ""our"" money as well?"
"The problem isn't that he wants more sex than he's currently having- 
the problem is how he's actually dealing with the situation. The reactions of most commenters would be drastically different if OP's boyfriend had these same issues and just talked to her openly and reasonably about it. Accusing her angrily and ignoring her for days seems more manipulative than anything else. His reaction makes it seem like HE doesn't want to compromise and indicates some sort of entitlement that he feels to her body."
"He didn't have a one night stand. He cheated on you for two years. That's two years of lies, where your relationship meant everything to you and nothing to him. And instead of dumping him, which is what he deserved, you accepted his proposal and allowed him to move in? The only lesson you've taught him is that he can do whatever he wants and you'll take him back no matter what."
"What a lovely person that chaplain sounds like. Ministering to someone regardless of whether they believe, just by talking to them and spending time with them so they feel comforted, is what a true person of god does. "
"IMO honesty is always the best. It doesn't mean you have to be so honest it hurts but tell your bf the gist of what you told us. Your bf's hubby's behavior pretty much ruined or put a damper on the entire weekend. Or, alternatively, you could just always be unavailable when they want to come to town. Personally, that kind of sneaky avoidance would stress me out and I'd go for the truth. Good luck and keep us updated. "
"Sounds like it's never going to work out.  He doesn't want to change.  Do you want to stay, knowing that he's never going to change?"
I know the game in question and am not unhappy to say I am reveling in his disappointment.  See your school in two weeks though!
"Yes, thank you. OP, it sounds like you need to educate yourself here. "
"""I'm sorry you didn't like my opinion about your choice of baby name.""

No but really?! Jenisus?! I'm curious to know what the logic is behind spelling it wrong. "
"Next time she comes over for the cooking thing, arrange for you to cook and for your wife to run a quick errand. Butcher the cooking, abuse the onion dicing, use the smallest knife you can for every task, all that. If she's mean to you, lay into her for being mean to both of you and make sure she's gone before your wife comes back. If she's nice, say it's such a shame that she's so bitchy to her sister when she cooks. Also tell her off and have her gone before your wife returns."
"I'm just a self taught home cook, but my roommates are thankful whether I make a gourmet meal, or a bunch of blue box mac and cheese (which is totally my weakness, although I do try to elevate it.) If fucking half strangers can be thankful for literally anyone cooking for them in even a basic way, someone's sister should be. She sounds like a dreadful person to be around. "
"If it was improvised, he probably hadn't thought THAT MUCH about it before he did it. I don't think he'd have done it with the intention of hurting you"
"Oh no, please don't feel this way. I understand where you're coming from (damn you society, trying to convince eveyone that women are baby-crazy marry-bots), but you have every right to talk about something that's important to you, even and especially something serious as getting married. Plus, you've been together for 5 years. It's not like you've been dating for a week. If you want to get married someday, this is going to be a conversation you're going to need to have, so might as well do it now."
"She checked out a long time ago. There's nothing to save, and it sounds like it was doomed from the start given how closed-off she is emotionally. 

Why are you so determined to keep her married to you against her will? "
"Yes, give in this time, but now start preparing financially for their next threat. "
"Yeah, I think I will. "
I'd hope ones ethnicity isn't equivalent to ones hair color or body type
I would let her sleep on the couch (or with her Mama's Boy) and move out to my gorgeous little house by myself for two weeks. 
"Stop. Please just stop.

You're going to be *so much happier* when you meet someone who matches your ambition and work ethic."
"Agree. And add to that I legitimately would be dead, probably, since I always respond pretty quickly to my family. I think I'd be totally fine with my parents assuming I was dead after 5 days."
Wow. It sounds like you both need to talk to a sex therapist and a counselor. 
"&gt; Living in a boutique house or bungalow in a college neighborhood has been my dream since I was tiny.

You've got to be a troll.  No way..."
...you want to cash out some/all of your husband's retirement plan to shave 10 minutes off your commute while nearly doubling your house payment? Yikes.
"Some abusive people are really great at holding up a lovely mask and love bombing their intended victim until they think their victim is vulnerable. I.e in OP's case everything flipped when they lost the apartment and had to move in with the abuser's mother. In other cases it might be merely moving in together, or getting engaged, or getting pregnant or married or moving to another country together. Some event takes place where the abusive person feels they are now in control and that their victim can't get away and boom. "
"Yeah, anywhere that recognizes common-law marriages requires that a couple publicly present themselves as married (refer to each other as ""my husband"" and ""my wife"" around other people, for example). The law is intended to recognize marriages that were never formally legalized (for example, for extremely rural people who didn't have access to a city hall), not just any romantic relationship in which the partners cohabitated."
hmm-well he did seem to wait until the moment their attention and knife was focused on the OP so I'm not sure it 'overwhelmed his rationale decision making'-seems he waited until his chances to escape were maximized-thats pretty rationale thinking.
"Did your anger result in calling up the place and screaming out the cashier or something? Its fine to be angry for whatever reason you want as long as you keep it to yourself and not inconveniencing someone. Being furious over something small doesnt mean youre a shitty person inherantly.

My mom always got insanely angry when her order was wrong, but she would aggressively take it out on ME when we got home and always refered to the cashiers as ""stupid n****ers"" and that isnt acceptBle either lmao

"
Being a similar weight as your gf... telling her to come to the gym is probably no solution. She needs to see a therapist/nutritionist to tackle the root of the problem. Please ffs try to find out if you can support her through that rough time or not
"Could be worse...my grandma's dermatologist treated her acne with low-dose radiation (this would have been late 1940's, I think)."
But you work full time at a law firm and don't have an extra $40/week to go out to dinner?
"She literally gave you 14 months to fix things. She talked to you about what was wrong every few months, and you didn't take any of it on board.

Let me tell you something: most secure relationships? Are secure BECAUSE of all those little things you refused to do for her.

What you did wrong was act immature and self-centered."

"&gt; as long as it isn't actively imposed on me

You apparently missed the part that essentially says *as long as it's not abuse*. It's neglect at the moment, and neglect is a good reason to leave, but it's also tolerable temporarily and taking time to get things planned and in order is immensely valuable. He'll be 'neglecting' her whether she stays or separates anyway. "
"Yeah that's how I felt as well.. He has always wanted a son because he wants his name to be passed down and having a daughter was a surprise. I was mad how he disregarded my feelings. 

We actually just got done having a talk and he said that he never intended to upset me and he was just making small talk. He reassured me that of course he will love his daughter because she's his first kid and that if he were a millionaire he'd want to adopt twenty kids. 

I told him how his comments made me feel and he apologized and said he wouldn't ever say anything like that again. Hopefully he really will love her the way he says.. Though I'm afraid I will have the thought that she's not what he really wants stuck in my head for a long time.."
"I don't think /r/relationships should support bad behavior just because we fell sorry for someone. She wants her husband to work 40 hours a week just because she has trouble explaining that he's retired to her friends. He supports her, and runs their home, which allows her to support her mum. She needs to appreciate what she's got. Talking down to her husband about being retired and underappreciating him isn't good for a marriage. I don't think she'd be able to send her mum much money if she was single and had to pay for her own upkeep and manage her own home."
"...WOW. So your girlfriend actually DID shut him down MULTIPLE TIMES. I'd think it was hilariously pathetic if the guy kept messaging me, too. Dude, you are insecure as fuck. She's not hiding anything from you, she shut him down, and now she ignores him. 

WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT FROM HER. 

Okay, so she's attractive and people approach her. Welcome to life as a woman! When I was 21, in a  long term serious relationship, 125 pounds and 5'10"", I would get practically sexually harassed on a daily basis. Seriously. It was CONSTANT. I got attention from every direction all the time no matter where I went. *This is reality for young women*. 

And your insecure brain is telling you she enjoys it? I can't speak for her, but I hated it. I just wanted to be left alone. 

She's going to have contact with the outside world while you two are together. You need to come to terms with that."
Or stay single and not be nagged to death. 
"Yeah, she picked up on your crush and is distancing herself from you now. Not irrational at all. You need to minimize contact for your own sake."
"&gt; We only discussed it in passing but she wanted another child and I agreed, I always wanted kids!

This is not talking about the issue. ""discussing in passing"" is not an honest heart to heart talk. And wtf does having a second kid have anything to do with the issues you brought up in your post? It's like you're conflating ""talking about anything serious"" with ""talking about what's really bothering me/us.""

&gt; She seemed happy to be with me, and happy to have our daughter (hence the want for another kid so soon). 

Again, this is you making assumptions. That's not talking about your issues either.

&gt; she would say motherhood was her focus but of course she'd like a career again. 

How did you respond to this? Did you talk about how to make that possible? Did you ask her how you could help shoulder the burden of childcare? Did you make sure to gauge if she was just saying that to make you feel better about her relinquishing her career?

&gt;  so I guess I didn't make enough of an effort to take care of her. To invite her to the gym etc. 

Why the fuck is ""taking care of"" your post partum wife all about going to the gym?? Jesus Christ, dude. Did you give her back rubs? Did you tell her you were grateful for the sacrifices she made? Did you cook dinner and do the chores so she could take a nap? Did you buy her flowers? Did you give her hugs and kisses and tell her she was beautiful and cherished and a wonderful mother?

&gt;  I did try to make her feel attractive, but she probably knew I didn't want her to be obese.

Somehow I don't believe the first part of this sentence. Even when asked about how you connect to your wife, all you talk about is the gym and her weight. 

&gt; What about her relationship with me though? How does she reason that?

I mean have you sat down and said to her, ""I feel like our intimacy has lowered since we had the kids, how can we find each other again""? Or something to that extent? Have you asked her how she feels about your relationship, if she's happy with it? 

Maybe she was depressed before because she knew 100% that you were harboring serious resentment about her weight, but didn't have anyone to go to. Then she came to terms with herself, found a better support system than her emotionally distant husband, and realized she could be happy wihtout having to rely on you."
"This.

She may have just been careless. That's forgiveable. Some times people don't realize what they've done until it's too late, and nobody is perfect enough to forsee all outcomes.

But with that said, she should have known better.

If she waves off your anger or tries to minimze the damage then you know she doesn't respect or care about your feelings. She may be defensive at first which is natural but if she doesn't come around to realize she made a mistake then you might want to break this off.

But keep in mind it's not your job to attack her. Do not come at her accusing her of maliciously trying to hurt you or anything. Tell her that you are upset by what she did, you felt a uncomfortable, embarassed, and even a little betrayed, but don't do it in an accusing tone. You're telling her how you feel so she can sympathize and learn to be more sensitive. Getting mad at her will only make her go on defense and that wont help anything.

You need her to see what it's like in your shoes, not slap her around for not caring."

"After being hospitalised for a suicide attempt I still had a 9 month waiting list before I could see the specialist disorders unit (this was several years ago, can't remember the proper name). You'd think an actual suicide attempt would get you in promptly, but mental health care in basically any country is complete shit."

"I'd call your mother and tell her that you are grateful for her defending you (because you are), but for the sake of your marriage and future grandchildren, she has said her piece and it's time to move on from this (because it is).  She doesn't need to be friends with your MIL (because ugh) but until MIL fires a new volley, let's call it a truce. "
"The best way to do emphasize this is to separate your accounts.  Lots of married couples do this.  Your paycheck goes into your account; his goes into his.  You each put a specified amount of money into a joint account each month (or have a % of your paychecks sent there), which covers household necessities like rent, utilities, etc.

Then, the money in your personal accounts is yours to spend.  You can't tell him how to spend the money in his account.  And he can't criticize the way you spend yours.  This is a very effective way to get off the anxiety cycle of watching your partner's expenditures, and it can be a nice forcing function to get someone to budget.

This is an extreme version of separating things, but there are many similar versions."
"There's a type of neglect where it's hard to notice it's even there.. Needs are met, roof over the head, food on the table, ability to seek medical treatment, etc but emotional needs aren't met. The child is made to feel like their feelings don't matter and end up suppressing them almost. 

You mentioned his father died, was it when he was young? Sometimes parents form non-sexual incestuous bonds with their children in which they treat the child much more like a friend/spouse/support system than a child. 

I'm just speculating obviously but it makes sense if he and his brother both experienced the emotional neglect with their mother so found a strong bond in each other."
"There have been many posts here where one family member is treated like shit and it didn't bleed out into other relationships. 

Remember the guy who participated in *beating* his little brother. His wife was blown away by this. Apparently the whole family beat this kid routinely. They all had otherwise healthy lives. This one kid was the exception to human dignity and respect.

I was the exception in my family.  So maybe I'm also speaking from anecdotal experience. "
"A bad earache can feel like you're dying. Deserves an ambulance if you haven't got other means of getting to hospital. Running out of critical medication sounds important to me. The sprained ankle might be a broken ankle so an ambulance would attend. But if you have a properly funded health system then you know that sometimes ambulances will be on non-life-threatening calls and that its part of what the community needs. Mobile urgent care. In Aus, theoretically, public services are there to provide *what the public needs*. So the remit of an organisation broadens to include unexpected things. Or, those needs are redirected to another service like home vists from nurses. Seriously - everyone deserves health care."

None of this is acceptable. I am livid on OP's behalf. This guy is scum and she should not at all be working anything out ""together"" with him, even the medical issue."
"I have a 15 year old and have worked with teens and once was a teen girl.  Here is a hard fact.  Girls can have sex at any time, at any day with different people each time.  Everyone thinks of teen age girls as sexual objects so they actually spend more time turning people down or ignoring offers than you have any idea.  One new sexual partner a month is way less than most teenage boys would get if they had women chasing them down all the time.

Now, to you.  Just because you have only had 3 partners by age 30 and are now chasing down a teenage girl...I shouldn't judge your game.  But since you slut shamed a young girl and then asked her to do porn and are ashamed of her...I am going to do it anyway.  You sir; are an ASSHOLE.  You are the scum of the earth.  That girl is never going to forget your look of disgust when she was vulnerable and honest with you.  You deserve to be rejected by every woman for the rest of your miserable life until you learn to respect women.  

Everyone deserves respect from the people they trust enough to share themselves with.  You need to go back to the 1950's and stay there."

I think you got this backwards- she treats HER bio kids poorly (OP's step kids) and OP's bio kids well (the wife's step kids).
"This. Everyone has their moments, but whether or not regret is present is the key. About half an hour before I broke up with my ex, we were on the phone and I got onto him for saying the n-word to describe his boss the night before. He said it in the midst of being very upset, because we were fighting about something else and he has a habit, when one thing upsets him, of delving into a long rant about everything else going wrong in his life, and I had never heard him say it before, so I maybe could have let it go. But when I got onto him, he said, ""That's just the way I was raised."" Charming. I drove to his apartment to break up in person. There were lots of other things going on, too-- I likely would have broken up with him regardless of racial slurs-- but I don't think I could have come back from that. You'll have to decide if you can come back from your boyfriend's lack of remorse on this issue."
"Look, of course you deserve to be happy. However, I don't see where you've said that you've tried any sort of couples therapy or anything like it to salvage an 8 year marriage.

"You were nineteen then, but you're thirty-four now. You have more power, agency and wisdom, and the ability to use all three. You can still re-write you and your daughter's stories.

"From these posts, she reminds me of myself when I was 18-21 years old dating a loser that I KNEW was a cheater but couldn't bring myself to dump him. Then I checked her age and she's approximately 40?? That is so terribly sad that someone with so much life experience would ignore this. I feel bad for her but we can't help her. We just can't. She knows what to do. She's just not doing it."
"Your next move is leave her alone.

You can't just fuck someone you have feelings for. You have developed strong feelings for this girl but she's NOT in to you and never was. Honestly you should have just stopped right then but you pressed on anyway, that was a mistake.

Stop with the mistakes. She's not into the arrangement anymore. Respect that. It doesn't matter why so STOP LOOKING FOR THE REASON. It all ends the same. 


Treat this like a breakup. You need time away from her. Lots of time, it sounds like. "
"As his ""good friends,"" they apparently felt it was totally fine to sexually assault OP and cause her distress, discomfort and violate both her trust and her feeling of personal safety/security around them in order to ""test"" her, supposedly on his behalf. That is disgusting.

It was also moronic, because her not wanting to sleep with Sam--whom she may find completely unattractive--doesn't even actually ""prove"" anything about her fidelity, unless they literally thought she'd sleep with ANYONE.

Most of my boyfriend's friends I find totally sexually unappealing. Both because they're his friends and because they vary from ""not bad looking but not my type"" to ""never in a million years."" Me not wanting to sleep with any of them has nothing to do with any sexual interest I might have in other people."

2. She tells you to not sit next to her so that she can sit next to said ""friend"" in a cab on the way to the club.

3. She proceeds to ditch you to spend one on one time with him ON YOUR FUCKING BIRTHDAY, and then gets mad at you for being upset about it because he's been having a hard time lately? Fuck THAT. 

Grow a spine and dump her. "
It's awesome that you are recognizing that this relationship has run its course and you're willing to go through the stress of ending it. So many people post here every day who aren't willing to make that leap. You should be proud of yourself even if it feels crappy right now. 
Maybe he's in a fugue state.
"First, if she does keep it, you need to get a DNA test before you let her put your name on the birth certificate or agree to anything.

If it is your child, if she has the baby and keeps it, you are going to be legally and morally obligated to pay child support.  You do not have to be a part of the child's life or your ex's, if you don't want to.  That's up to you.

From now on, wear a condom every time you have sex, unless you actually want to impregnate someone.  You should have been wearing one anyway, since you weren't in a relationship with her anymore and she could have been having sex with other people.  Also, don't continue to see and have sex with someone you were in an unhealthy relationship with.  You broke up for a reason.  You should have gone no-contact.  "
"Sometimes after reading posts on here I say to myself ""God I'm so thankful for the husband I have"". "
"Wow. Just ...wow. The level of betrayal here is staggering and I personally could never trust her again.

For me, no. For you? Your call, but you should seriously consider the way she threw her vows away and forced you into the ""other man"" role without ever allowing you the choice to opt out. "

"I've been through marriage counseling and it was very helpful to me, but you get out of it what you put into it. Not saying the more money you spend the more results you get, but you have to be really dedicated to following the guidelines you establish over the first few weeks of it. You're right, you probably shouldn't do marriage counseling, because if you're not willing to try it at least a couple of times because it's not cheap, you definitely won't be willing to make the dramatic changes in your lifestyle that are necessary to save your marriage. You should probably go ahead and get a divorce."

Are you the boyfriend?
She may have been vague to avoid being recognized.
"Then cut contact with her and be done with it.  


She doesn't deserve the amount of hatred you're projecting onto her and she certainly doesn't deserve to be told that you wish she had been the one to die instead of your dad.  If I was your family member and heard all the shit you were doing, I'd boycott your wedding and probably never talk to you ever again because you sound abusive and viciously immature."

"Frankly, OP's first paragraph, listing the sister's poor life choices that aren't quite relevant to the situation at hand, made me suspect that maybe he took her request for critique as an opportunity to lay into her."
I think you should also apply for jobs in your spare time instead of just quitting cold turkey. This might help when you explain to him why your quitting. If you have a different job to go to you might also feel better and have less of a chance with going back.
"Sex isn't just a biological urge.  For many it is the most intimate expression of connection between two people.  It is why we form relationships, for heaven's sake!  Otherwise, we would partner with people but just screw whoever we fancied without adverse repercussions to the partnership.  It sounds like you and your wife have the appearance of a close partnership, but that connection is not really there at the heart of it, at least not for you.  You do not feel accepted and acknowledged in an intimate way and she does not get to say that your feelings are invalid.  You have to ask her, does she feel intimately connected to you even without sex?  Really?  Or does she see your marriage as more of a cooler arrangement?  Also, has she considered whether she moving towards asexuality?  If so, where would that leave your relationship?  Compatibility in a relationship does not give one partner's needs permanent and exclusive priority over the other person's needs.  She cannot unilaterally change the fundamental connection of your relationship and expect you to just accept it.  You have some hard conversations and some hard decisions ahead of you.  "

3) You really tried to trade sex for forgiveness? And never once thought 'huh, this isn't a path to a happy relationship'?

4) He should never have said the rape thing. Do not for a minute think this in anyway excuses your own behavior. 

Either realize you need to drastically change your outlook on what fidelity, remorse and a loving relationship look like or break up with the guy. You don't deserve him."
"He sounds like the boyfriend of an old friend of mine. She never corrected him either when he said shit things to me. I don't talk to them anymore.

There's not honestly a lot you can expect from your friend. She's consciously choosing to let him bully you so you have to defend yourself by not allowing his behaviour to continue. As to how, I'm not sure. I hope you find a way to do it without offending your friend."
"He had a quarterlife crisis and followed by a job cut, so he has basically been freelancing/doing odd consultant jobs, but nothing steady. It doesn't bother me that much, since I know he's trying. He's had a bunch of interviews lately, but nothing has panned out. He's an educated guy and we actually met at our previous job, so we knew each other before we started dating. I can handle waiting for him to get a job, since I'd want to have the same support from him if I found myself unemployed, but I am not going to put up with RP/PUA techniques."
"&gt;I think she's having an affair

You ""think"" she's having an affair?

What's it going to take before you're sure? Her getting plowed over your sleeping body? Ask yourself what it will take for you to get angry about her infidelity and then assume that it's happened, because it is has. 

You should see a lawyer ASAP and start making moves to protect yourself in the coming divorce. 

Good luck. She's five steps ahead of you and, as long as you refuse to see the truth that's now sat on your face and wiggled, she is fully in control and will continue to treat you and your marriage as a joke. "
"&gt; I don't think it's humanity's job to make sure my husband doesn't cheat on me.

But do you think it's humanity's job to care about you and every other human? If so, a decent person wouldn't help someone else hurt you like that. Only a shit person would.

&gt; I would probably question this woman's judgement of character in picking sexual partners, but I wouldn't hold her responsible for destroying any relationships. 

I think the issue I have is that while I'm comfortable saying she isn't responsible for destroying any relationships, she is being a shitty, horrible human being not merely having ""perhaps maybe"" low character. No, she's a shit person doing shit things. It seems like you're not willing to condemn her for the shitty person she is and that's...confusing. "
"No, your husband destroyed trust in your marriage. It's embarrassing how much you're reaching to believe him. "

Honestly, I would also start to document times she doesn't do her homework and submit it to the judge. Let your husband know that you are doing so, not because you want him to lose out on time with his children, but because you and your daughter need him to parent her, fun and not-fun parts of it."

"Are you sure the problem won't just shift to something else if she had a job and friends?

"I think sometimes students don't realize that effeciancy doesn't equal laziness. The aim for most projects should be to do the work adequate to get the grade you desire and then move on. If I had learned that earlier I would have been much happier in middle and high school.

"Of course not, with the recent controversy over the Moana costume though, I'm sorry if this is ignorant but what is the difference?"
Nope. No way. Hell no. They used this woman's previously disclosed history of abuse to terrorize her to the point that she pissed herself from fear and panic. They used their strength to force her to relive that hell. Thinking it's hilarious to do something like that isn't a natural side effect of being sheltered or a teenage boy. I find it very disturbing that you appear to think so.
"&gt; I would actually relish someone getting in my face and listing off every reason why they can't stand me.

A therapist would do this, albeit in a kinder way.

&gt;The weird thing is, is it seems to be an overnight thing that I can't ever pinpoint.

These things rarely happen overnight and it doesn't necessarily have to stem from an altercation or even a clash of personality. I used to work in a secondary school with someone who, while his heart was in the right place, was completely unsuited to working with kids. He used to treat them as his mates, ask them who they had crushes on and show them weird videos on his phone. He also had zero social awareness and would muscle in on private conversations or try to get people's attention for a pointless chat while they were very obviously preoccupied. He was just... creepy and completely unaware of it.

He was eventually sacked after six months for misconduct. He continued to use his phone around the kids he was working with and was, apparently, blindsided by the decision despite the numerous warnings he received. The worst part of it was he put the school down as a reference while applying for a new job in a primary school. 

I'm not saying you're weird, creepy or inappropriate but there's obviously something you're unaware of that's causing you problems in the workplace. The good thing is, you're aware of your unawareness, and now you need to work on figuring out what it is.

[Edit]

&gt;I'm in the medical field (not a Dr or nurse, think lab tech type jobs) and I've heard they're VERY cliquey and hierarchical and homogeneous.

Right... yeah, this is also a problem. I have no experience in the medical field, but trying to break into any tight, cliquey social circle is difficult as fuck. Add onto the fact that it's generally harder to establish yourself within an already established circle as an adult and you have yourself a recipe for disaster. It sucks, but maybe consider a career change or look for a startup medical lab where having to fit in won't be such a problem."

"&gt; just sayin', he was in a terrible situation too, and that was likely the only choice available that didn't put you in more danger,

I agree that he was in a terrible sitch and that his running to get help in a lot of ways made sense. I am disagreeing that his leaving didn't put her in more danger. When there were 2 people there, the robbers had to divide their focus and control both. With only one, they could do whatever they wanted. I'm so glad she didn't get killed or raped. ANd the fiance could not have predicted that; he doesn't know these people. (The time I personally was mugged at machete point, it was definitely a robbery for profit but things took a sexual turn and I got sexually assaulted, so I am myself quite aware that robbery &amp; rape go hand in hand)."
"Right, I was waiting for someone to mention this. I've been put in situations before where someone was threatening my male partner and even though I was female, smaller and weaker than him, no way would I have EVER cut and run like this. You just don't bail on your person in a dangerous situation. His justification for doing so is also counter to every single piece of self-defense advice and training I've ever had. "
They are also usually the ones who refuse to give someone respect because 'they didn't earn it'. 
"To be honest, he doesn't sound mature or mentally stable enough to be married.  I would make this a *very* long engagement if I were you, and don't put any money or time into planning until he can demonstrate that he can stop being so selfish and immature.  "
"It honestly comes down to: you're married to someone. Physical attraction can disappear for a multitude of reasons. i.e.: horrific accident causes physical deformity? I would just hope relationships are built on more than physical attractiveness. I mean, it definitely needs to be there for sure. But in OP story, that 20lbs should have been handled much differently. Like some people said before, work on it together. I'm sure he is far from perfect. "
"I think you have more than enough reason to be concerned that a surprise visit may not be the best idea. I mean, basic etiquette alone is not to surprise someone with a houseguest. Do you think it's possible that he's not telling them until you're there because he knows they won't be comfortable with it but they can't kick you out if you're already there?

Also, assuming that there isn't something else going on and it is okay for you to stay, you should abide by whatever sleeping arrangements they are comfortable with. If they don't want you two sharing a bed, then don't. It is their home after all. "
"I actually laughed when he said he ""gently"" told his wife he wasn't attracted to her because of the weight, but then refers to having sex with her as ""fat sex."" I think this guy jerks off to porn too much and expects women to have thigh gaps with their rib/hip bones showing."
this needs to be top post
"Yeah it sounds like you're applying double standards and just completely don't care about empathising with the guy.

&gt; But if you're in a loving and sexually fulfilling relationship, you do what's without your comfort zone

It sounds like he *was* doing that, but she wasn't. She didn't seem to be interested in going out of her comfort zone. And it meant that if she got what she wanted, OP being with him forever, he wouldn't ever get to sexually experiment and try all the things that she had tried.

The reason it was usual routine was because he actually committed to the relationship, and was ready to do what he didn't like for her."
"No matter how you change the wording, giving this list to him as a list is a bad idea. This poster is saying that you can USE this list to start a conversation, not that giving him the list is a good idea."
"If she can't have a civil relationship with you, its time for him to make tough choices. She isn't allowed to have an opinion about his life at all. Where and who he lives with is absolutely none of her business. She doesn't get to demand you aren't in your home. She is being childish. 

She won't move on if she sees him every other week. Maybe start pushing it to longer visits and trade off every 2 weeks or once a month even. "
"Because he works 14 hour days? Not to say that his successes in his career aren't important (they absolutely are), OP works long hours too, *and* is continuing her education *and* taking on the majority of the house work. OP seems more successful in balancing her responsibilities and career with her relationship. "
Some people just have their shitty 2c to add and they're gonna add it regardless of relevancy to the topic. 
Is she seeing a therapist or psychologist for talk therapy as well as someone for her meds?
"Look, you came here for advice and this is the advice given. Counseling works, as evidenced by everyone praising it. As far as communication between you two go we can only do so much. You need someone with experience who can mitigate you two. "
"Most men associate ""wet"" with sexually aroused and don't know that we get discharge even when we're not having sex (also, it's a discharge so knowing that she gets wet during sex is kind of irrelevant).  Also, you can do laundry without checking inside someone else's panties you know - and it's probably more respectful not to be looking in someone else's panties during laundry."
OP should've  checked himself before he wrecked himself. 
I did the same thing spending six grand on a dog that Needed chemo and although I had to borrow the money I wouldn't regret those extra six months we got with her for a second.

no the man shot his 8 year old son. You don't do that without being an idiot unless there is a very specific equipment malfunction and even then you were probably being negligent (like pointing a loaded weapon anywhere in range of A FREAKING 8 YEAR OLD). This is from the perspective of a guy who learned his gun safety getting borderline tackled for waving a gun around at a range the first time I ever went in FL with a friend. A bunch of people politely but VERY FIRMLY explained how barrels only get pointed down freaking range because who knows what will happen and how well mantained your gun is. This made sense to me as an IT person - everything breaks.
"I called the cops on my aunt once when she left our house drunk and angry and had a 30min drive home. They found her driving over the yellow line. She called me later that night from jail saying she never wanted to speak to me again. She never has.

Oh well, at least she didn't kill anybody, including herself. "
"The last sentence is exactly what I'm thinking. We can all argue about what is morally right or wrong forever, but OP isn't able to control whatever feelings (i.e. guilt) and damage might be caused by OP's (ex-)friend's mistakes. "
"I'd love to know:

1. Explain exactly what kind of 'provocative snapchat' he exchanged with the other girl and how long they were messaging 
2. How long have you been together? How long did you live together before asking him to move out?

It really sounds like you're sabotaging the relationship, but it's hard to tell if that is warranted because of how he previously behaved. You are the one that escalated the situation repeatedly last night. Even though he showed a physical sign of frustration by banging his fists on the table, it seems like crying out of nowhere--&gt; refusing to talk to him --&gt; kicking him out --&gt; bombarding him with calls/texts --&gt; putting his stuff on the curb --&gt; refusing to talk it out the next day... you basically pushed things to this conclusion, right? 

  Maybe this is the conclusion that is best for you, but this is not this one argument that should determine whether you try to repair the relationship or not. 
"
"How do we know it has nothing to do with him? It sounds like it does. I wouldn't want to have sex with someone who acted like this.

It sounds like you're expecting her to accept full responsibility for their issues, not even just part. Which is patently ridiculous."
"You're allowed not to like smoking or drinking.  You're allowed to not want to be with someone who smokes or drinks.  The trouble is, you went ahead and married someone who does.  And you've apparently known this was something she enjoyed for as long as you've known her, so I'm confused as to why you took that step without talking these issues out in advance and determining what you both could live with, or deciding this was a dealbreaker and walking away.  Did you think this was some kind of phase and the two of you would just turn into your parents as soon as you slipped the ring on her finger?

You say that you're willing to adjust.  If so, then I think you need to accept that just because you consider these ""single"" activities does not mean the rest of the world shares your views, and your aversion to them does not need to extend to everyone else in your life.  If you need to go back to a counselor for help with that, do so.  But if you really can't get over it, better to walk away and find someone who'll impart the values you consider important to your future children than to burden your wife with your insecurities and projections from your doorman days."
"&gt; Maybe your friends and family dislike your boyfriend and might have reason to

If i didn't like a friends' partner to the extent I would skip a party to avoid them, I wouldn't accept in the first place, not accept then cancel.

Ultimately, most of the invitees decided they had a better offer when the time came, even if that better offer was staying in and watching tv. I've been there: invited to an event where I thought 'yeah, that could be fun, if I happen to be in the mood at the time, and other people I know are going, and I'm not too tired from something else I did the day before, and I don't get a last-minute invite to something I'd prefer' etc. But then I'd never give a firm commitment if that was the case.

Some people will just always treat an acceptance like a maybe, other times perhaps it would help if there was a 'maybe' or soft acceptance option, so at least you know how many flakey people you're depending on.

But ultimately, the people who dropped out probably just aren't that close as friends. OP: if you like them enough that you're okay with them turning up or not when you invite them to something, you're happy if you see them, equally happy if you don't, then continue on that basis. But if you want them as close, dependable friends, your bf is right to say look elsewhere."
"Congratulations, OP. I have no fucking idea what's going on here. This is one of the strangest things I've read on this sub. 

IMO, your response to her next message should be: ""Look, I don't see why we're doing this. Why don't we just stop now because I'm not looking for a buddy."""
"And you'll get the... Oh, you have to switch jobs because of attractive coworker or we have to move because of attractive new neighbor. It will never stop until you work at a job you hate, have not contact with family or friends. No the fuck thanks"
"K, so this seems all kind of weirdly childish given your ages, but I'll go ahead and give you my opinion on why you should probably just keep it to a ghosting.

I feel like if you ""call her out on it"" at this point, you'd be admitting that you used her for a while for the sake of the tickets.  Sure, you could turn it around and point out the shitty behavior that precluded the ticket issue, but her figuring out that you did use her for a time is probably just going to make her feel justified in that behavior.

Just move on.  Focus on being the kind of friend you want to have and cultivating relationships that are mutually supportive.  It doesn't really sound like you're losing much in cutting this friend out, but you could also possibly gain a lot in learning from the experience.

Judging from this post alone, it honestly doesn't sound worth it to put any more effort into being angry at her, which is what calling someone out is doing."
If you suspect it's the older sister and now your 15 year old daughter who was trying to be nice to her drug addict sister is now going to have a mark on her record for something she didn't do that can potentially hurt her future. You need to talk to your older daughter and you need to get your younger daughter out of there. Get the older daughter some treatment for her drug use.
I know :( I'm going crazy over here. I'm just glad I finally worked up the nerve to ask. 
"Just to echo the same thing. I had a relationship where the libido was mismatched and that was fine, but it was how he would brush me off or be aloof with me that was incredibly hurtful. If he had just explained, sorry, I'm not into this just now because of such and such that would've been one thing, but very often I got scoffing or roll eyes etc. I think to fixable OP if you want it to be fixable. "
"As a fellow woman who chose not to report her rape, I would like to tell you that I totally respect your decisions. Your decisions deserve respect.

Mutual or kinda rapey?
It would just fit the general profile.
"Where are you getting this idea? If the genders were reversed the advice in that comment would be the same.

If a family member is doing something that really bothers your partner, make the family member stop.

The advice here is so in favor of the wife because she just had a baby, and that does all kinds of weird things. She did all the work there, and now things have changed in her chemistry, so she needs to be catered to in this situation. Please look this up, because it's a real thing.

If the wife was just being shitty for no reason, that's different. But just giving birth changes everything. Do you just think women should pop babies out, no complaints, then go back to normal? That's not how life works, kid. 

No one is saying fuck OPs happiness. They're saying don't LEAVE your wife because she's having mood swings after having a baby. Try to be a partner and get to the bottom of the problem together.

Imagine if OP suddenly had a bout of depression and 6 weeks into the change OPs wife left him. That's nuts. "
"Based on this post and comments you've made, your boyfriend sounds like an abusive asshole who deliberately sought out a younger person to be able to manipulate. As someone who has had to put up with her boyfriend having some jackass friends, let me tell you, this is not normal ""my friends are kinda jackasses"" behavior. He is deliberately putting you in dangerous situations, minimizing your discomfort, invading your privacy, and it is only going to get worse. Dump him. You can absolutely do better, and you deserve better.

Edit: fixed an error"
"&gt; I agree that it's probably in the kids' best interest to maintain somewhat regular contact with OP. It must be traumatic for them to lose both their father and their step-mother

This. Those kids are going to resent their mom when they grow up and fully comprehend what went down after their dad died."
"But she usually contacts them within 24 hours, she knew her data plan was acting up, and she didn't find any other way to say ""Hey, folks, no worries, still alive"" in FIVE DAYS? Heck, I'm surprised they waited that long before calling someone to check in on her.

If there was an established pattern of being out of contact for days at a time, yes, this would be an overreaction. But your sister went from 'once a day' to 'five days of complete silence and no contact of any form' without any more warning than 'Huh, my data plan looks a little funny right now.' It's entirely reasonable for your parents to start worrying and ask a reasonable local authority to go do a wellness check."

"For what it's worth, I still wouldn't blame her if she wasn't getting paid. I think the only person who can be a homewrecker is the one who cheats after making a marriage vow. Sure, I would probably question this woman's judgement of character in picking sexual partners, but I wouldn't hold her responsible for destroying any relationships. She's not tricking married men into sleeping with her. Regardless of money, these men are making a conscious choice to break their vow. That's deplorable. That makes me sick. But I'm over the idea that the other woman is the evil, alluring temptress leading innocent married men into sinful actions. I'm just saying put the relationship accountability squarely where it belongs. "

"See if you can encourage your dad to try therapy and/or go to a doctor to get checked out before he does anything rash.  It seems like this came on very suddenly for him, and post-natal depression can actually affect men sometimes.  

But other than that, it's best just to be understanding and supportive without getting too involved in their relationship issues.  

Be assertive about your own desires though - it sounds like you are very attached to your stepmom and your baby sister, so don't let your dad steamroll you into thinking that you never get to see them again and that you have to make a clean break.  You deserve to maintain a relationship with your sister."
"These days, there's pretty much a never-ending onslaught of books and articles telling parents to stop helicoptering and let their kids figure things out on their own more often.

"Hey, OP, I do all kinds of needle art. If you PM me a picture of Marco and some shipping information, I'll get started on a plushie for your lil bro.  No cost at all. It'd be my pleasure.

You know, if you really wanted to go scorched earth on him. 

Like you, I was always the ""defuser"" in my fucked up family, taking the responsibility of prodding family members into exploding and directing/redirecting rage at me rather than my baby sister. I already knew what it was like to grow up the scapegoat, and I never wanted her to go through that. So I made sure I was the 'black sheep' who would stand up to abusive family members so she could be the 'golden child.' It is a horrible mental situation to be in, and you are so brave and so strong for advocating for your little brother.

"You can't make any judgement on his spending until you stop being ignorant of your overall financial picture.

Nagging your husband for an expensive dog when you don't even know if you guys are in debt is extremely irresponsible.

"
Please spend more time on here before you say that crap : /
"There are two ways to get a dog responsibly. Either go through a reputable breeder, or rescue. If you do neither of these things, you are directly contributing to backyard breeding, puppy mills, and pet overpopulation problems which leads to dogs being euthanized for space in shelters. 

Financially, even if you only pay $200 for a ""purebred"" puppy upfront, you will likely have thousands and thousands of dollars in vet bills from the poor breeding of that animal and it will cost you more in the long run. Cancers, joint, knee, and hip issues, genetic defects, etc. Reputable breeders health test for genetic conditions related to the breed, they often offer health guarantees, basically a warranty for a few years. They also breed for proper temperament so you're less likely to end up with a dog that has genetic aggression, anxiety or fear issues. In some instances they even offer free boarding and are a great resource for the rest of that animals life. 

Shelters get puppies in all the time and yes it may take a little more time and planning, but a puppy should anyways. Shelters get all sorts of dogs at all ages all the time. I work at one and we get everything from puppies to seniors, big dogs, small dogs, all the time. Granted we are a very large shelter but check in with a few in your area and ask them some questions. Often the dogs will come already spayed/neutered, microchipped and vaccinated for that adoption fee. 

Look I know at the end of the day if you want that cute craigslist puppy for $200 there's nothing an Internet stranger can do. Sorry for the mini rant but aside from the relationship aspect of this post, please think a little more about where this dog is going to come from. "
"You want that sort of friendship, but she made it clear that she doesn't. You say you want a platonic friendship, but you also have a big crush on her. Your attempts at friendship are probably perceived differently by her, and she felt uncomfortable. There really is nothng to be gained by keeping in contact.

I suggest you try to get over that crush and just limit contact. Shouldn't be hard, as she wants that as well. Try and date other girls."
"My fiancé was the same way. He 'loved' his mom but at the same time wasn't emotionally invested at all. I was confused and pushed for a relationship with her. Now, we are both no contact with her.

My fiancé's mom is very BORING to say the least; however, she is very controlling and rude. She is manipulative as hell. My fiancé never noticed these things because he wasn't very good at picking things up and is very easily swayed. He doesn't like confrontation so he just always did what his mother said. 

Basically, he wasn't aware that she was toxic; however, subconsciously he was aware which is why he never actually wanted to be around her and do things. 

So maybe that is it? 

Edit: His mom comes across SOO nicely at first and I loved her until I actually got to know her. She was the kind of mom that 'softly' dropped hints that maybe my fiancé shouldn't be with me. Out of the 'kindness' of her heart, she was just looking out for her baby. (Blah blah) I'm not sure where I was going with this story! However, it gives you something to think about maybe. My fiancé's mother seriously comes across as the nicest person and she kind of is; however, that is the problem. Since she is so nice she expects everybody to be that nice as well! For instance, she hates the word dumb and I used it around her not knowing it and from then on she thought I was the devil. So her niceness makes her very judgmental and you wouldn't know until you get close enough to hear it. 

If your boyfriend doesn't like confrontation, or is easily controlled, or bad at reading people, then he might not know he has a bad relationship with her."
"Stay in contact with her, but be wary. I'm sure that you're right that something is wrong, and just because she's been nice so far, you don't know that issues won't come up. You might research attachment issues, because it sounds like something went wrong when your SO was a young child. "
"&gt; EDIT: INSTEAD OF ATTACKING ME, CAN SOMEONE GIVE ME REAL ADVICE ON HOW TO APPROACH HER ABOUT THIS? THANKS.

Here's what you do:

""GF, I saw that you watch anal sex, but I'm too self absorbed and childish to recognize that you can watch something without wanting it. I don't think we should be in this relationship anymore because you can do better than someone who repeatedly questions your boundaries and equates your trustworthiness with your willingness to perform sexual acts."""

"OP-everyone has mentioned lawyering up but remember to keep any and all written correspondence that indicates she was having an affair, if you have it. You deserve better than this. Even IF there were problems going on in your marriage, it's no excuse to cheat and have an affair. 

Her grief over this is hers to bear and hers alone. She stopped being your partner the moment she chose another man over you and your children. And make no mistake, that's what she's done. So now you get to do what you deserve-choose yourself and your children. Good luck OP. I think pretty much everyone here is rooting for you. "

A lot of (older) relatives have not talked to me since and made a lot of racist remarks or really immature questions! 

I just ignored the behavior and my immediate family shut them up whenever they had something to say. So support from your immediate family is a serious plus! Be thankful for that!

You don't want the car to sit because it will end up with a whole host of mechanical and electrical problems.  

Take the car back and sell it for $1000.  Give your parents their $200 back.  Or better yet, find a single mom with no car who needs and just give it to her.  It will change her world and you'll receive some of the appreciation you should have gotten the first time around from your brother."
"If you two communicate as well as you say you do, why all the misinterpretation regarding marriage? Marriage should be something a couple discuss when things get serious...so I am just a bit confused over the misinterpretation surrounding the issue between both of you?

This is your real problem, your wife's tendency to continue to baby him. even after you guys don't live with him anymore, is she going to continue to help support him financially? You absolutely have to square this with your wife. In the meantime, stop complaining about him. He's obviously extremely annoying but again, the person you really need to worry about is your wife.

"Links aren't allowed in this sub but you should Google ""Diana Adams Law"" This woman is poly herself and runs a family law firm in Brooklyn geared towards poly and other non-traditional families. If they can't help you themselves, (maybe they only practice in New York state) they will possibly have other contacts in Pennsylvania that they can direct you to. Good luck!"
"Are you in therapy? There are a lot of deep-rooted issues here that will take a while to untangle.

The short answer is that you need to develop a sense of self-worth and realize that your own opinion of yourself is much more important than theirs. The journey to that point is difficult, however."
"Perhaps speak with a lawyer then?  One who can perhaps also inform her that if she posts anything libelous online that causes you actual damages, you will have an ironclad lawsuit against her."
"Dude, you're not _supposed_ to change.  A marriage is accepting your partner exactly how they are.  How much has _she_ changed during this time to make this marriage work?  I'm guessing not at all.

Your kids deserve better than to live in a broken home.  And so do you."
She's apparently of the sort that thinks it's old fashioned and oppressive to have to grow up and be an adult. 
"&gt; I feel that the OP's bf is unfairly assuming that she's lying on other things too.

That's the thing about trust - once you find out one line, you being looking for the others. It doesn't matter if they're not there, you're going to look for them anyway."
"Yeah, but that's not the same thing as complaining that their partner is not hot enough."
"Pretty sure OP's mom did that herself already.

Trying to disown your kid over Facebook is insane. It's not hard to question how good of a parent she was before that"
"I love you, Tiger Millionaire. ಡ_ಡ"

"He's a 32 year old man who sat, and watched a dying woman cry because *he* didn't like her music or religious beliefs. He was punishing her because she believes in God, and that's absolute bullshit.

Op, you didn't overreact. I would have reacted much more myself. He can believe whatever he wants as far as religion goes, but *how dare he* use it to abuse a woman battling cancer. Fuck him."
"*Honey we used to kiss goodnight and I loved and that and felt appreciated and wanted.  Lately it seems like we haven't been doing that and I wanted to check about how you feel about a goodnight kiss.  I would love to kiss you every night and morning and more hugs too...*

The best way to communicate is I statements, talk about your feelings, care about hers (even if, especially when, you feel differently).

Also please stop with the mind  reading that her saying or doing this 'means sex'.  You have a lot probably comments like you don't communicate and connect with what your wife is feeling.

If you feel like MC would help you two communicate better, know that it's not a sign of divorce but a positive way to have help with communicating."
He can propose to you and still sleep with his ex on the side. Don't be ridiculous.
You can only harvest from a garden you nurture.
He's known her for five years and you've known him for three months. You're not in a position to pick this battle. My best friend (a guy) had his fiancé give him an ultimatum not to hang out with me (a lady) due to jealousy. We've been best friends for 18 years. They're not engaged anymore.

Kink shaming isn't really helpful. 
"I can see why you guys do so well with the poly lifestyle. I'm super glad to hear that you're both being considerate of each other's feelings and decisions.

Personally, I think abortion may be the best option. Logically speaking, if she's lessening contact between herself and the boyfriend, you don't wanting to raise the kid (which is genuinely okay, different strokes for different folks), and the two of you would rather start trying for your own child in less than a year, abortion just works.

You'll both wanna go to therapy for awhile and work through both of your emotions either way. Abortion, no matter what the situation, can be traumatising to the woman. She's going to need to see a professional to work through that and you will too for the hurt and jealousy your feeling. You completely understand *why* you feel that way, but you still do, and talking to a therapist could help."
"sadly, it looks like people or someone has already started downvoting all the positive response's to OP's post. Hugs to both you, and /u/assaultedthrow00. Don't let the handful of assholes get to you. "
"You're most definitely not asking for too much.You should probably file for a divorce. There's little to rectify here. He won't go to therapy, he won't take meds, he doesn't contribute financially whatsoever. He's been like this for 4 years and you accepted it/allowed him to make you believe you were to blame, and only now that you're well you can actually see what's up. 4 years to deal with your own husband gaslighting you, making no contributions to a life you're supposed to share, and now this violent shit. You need to file for a divorce. Your parents can probably account for the violent behavior and if there's any document that says PTSD on it, you're in the clear. Though it doesn't look like him talking half would make that big of a dent. You need to get this man out of your life. It's absolutely ridiculous that he refuses to get help for his emotional problems for his own son. Wtf."
OP's girlfriend would have had to convince her 7 year old daughter not to call her mom in front of him or act like her daughter.  Any woman who does that to their own kid isn't a great mom.
"TIL.  Wow, I've been married for over 10 years and I thought I knew everything; turns out that I don't know shit."
Log off the internet? Do people still log ON the Internet???
I think you may be the modern day Holden Caulfield. 
"There is a real chance what your friend did was rape and at the very least it was both predatory and wildly inappropriate. This is not an ""agree to disagree"" situation. You and she may not have been there, but you have the testimony of the person who should be most inclined to display his actions in a favorable light and guess what? His testimony makes him look terrible."
OP has had a crush on the friend and has posted numerous times under various usernames about it. Unsurprising she is reading too much into each little interaction.
Dude.  Stop feeding into the insanity.  Delete the profile and try to actually start moving on.  Stop it with this shit.  
"So let me get this straight, op. You want to move your wife, a small child, and what will be at most a six month infant to one of the most expensive states where she'll know no one, have no support system, expect to be the breadwinner, and watch two young children, (a top 5 PhD program is going to be intense) while you are in grad school? Really!?"
"When you put it that way, it's like saying my future wife is 10 years old now"

"&gt; He says its your choice after the fact as an attempt to change the story. Next time you bring this up, he'll remind you that it was your choice last time &amp; you -chose- to change into a more modest outfit. 

holy shit, you are wise."
"I'm going to give you context that the others haven't. There aren't that many people to meet in the south pole. I don't know how much you know about the south pole, but it isn't like going to Paris or New York. It's basically only people on official research study business that get to go there.

Whether you want to break it with him is up to you, but I know if I was him, I'd love it if I had a girlfriend to go back home to. Antartica can be a very veeery lonely place.

The number of people there vary from time to time, but it isn't a lot.  "
Ah yes the stoic male who must resist the emotional dramatics of the females. Barf. Let go of those gender stereotypes dude!
"Elsewhere in the thread, OP mentions that it's a $100 expense. No need to go to war over something so small in the long run. "
"I've worked at private schools my whole teaching career and bullying like this has never been tolerated by a school community. This school sounds very well respected, and usually that translates to not just a school with high academic standards, but a high moral standard as well. 

You need to go into ""mom"" mode at this time. Reach out to the leadership at the school to talk about this. It may be that the teasing is coming from one or two individuals. Which is manageable to deal with, but is insurmountable to your brother, who is used to being ""hot shit"". Also, for 30k, the schools should have at least one counsellor- talk to them asap."
"Ex's are part of your past. How long were they dating? I don't hide or delete pictures from my social media. Even if the people aren't in my life anymore, we still shared those moments and experiences. 

It's not a big deal and it sounds more like you are making a lot of assumptions here. "
"Yes. He did not care about your pain. At all. For a very long time. He just cared about his own needs being met.

But now your absence is causing him pain, and he is trying to fix his pain. Don't fool yourself, for one second, into thinking he is a changed man. He is just doing what he needs to do to avoid pain.

And once the children are born, children he DOES NOT WANT, leaving you will fix his pain. "
I think you're a horrible person and above all a horrible sister for even considering it.
"This isn't just sexual attraction, he said he was IN LOVE with her and WANTED TO BE WITH HER. 

And you say ""sexual attraction"" can't be controlled like wanting to fuck your stepdaughter you knew as a child is a totally normal, logical thing. If he locked these feelings away or talked to a professional that wouldn't change the fact he's having these feelings. 

It's not just an inappropriate crush. It's not like you're crushing on your teacher or boss. It's not like you think a second cousin or in law is cute. This guy was basically her father and expressed his undying love."
"I'm not really worried about it too much, all of my documents and important stuff is all online so its safe, and I've already bought new clothes and a new computer. I might look into it, but I don't think I'll need too."
"&gt; Asians are very much racist btw

I think you meant to say ""Asians *can be* very racist btw""

Because surely you didn't mean to generalize an entire ethnicity as racist."
"OK. 

But he is torpedoing your career future for selfish purposes. 

Realistically you will have to give up your field, even if you marry.

TALK TO HIM about all this."
"Jesus. 

Well, there are no easy solutions here. But you should think about whether you can really live like this for another 5+ years, and whether Duvall can (he's about to be a teenager and I can't imagine a teen not acting out in this situation). I don't know whether your school counselor will be able to help, but it's certainly worth asking them the question. Good luck!"
"I hear you. It's morally ""icky"" that someone you love supported an industry that is so entangled with human trafficking. There is, of course, no way he could possibly know for sure that the woman he paid for sex was willing and not just a good actress who would be punished for letting on that she was there by force. That would freak me out, too.

But there are many industries that are entangled with the evil that is human trafficking - clothing companies, restaurants, hotels. We all might have unwittingly participated in the enslavement of other humans without realizing it.

What's important here is that your husband agrees that it would be wrong to have sex with someone who was unwilling. He believes he didn't. He didn't try to justify a decision to force someone or use violence against someone. You don't actually disagree on the moral question, just what may or may not have happened. That's a resolvable difference, I think - while the former wouldn't be.

Since this isn't something he's still doing, I think you can agree to disagree on the nature of the industry and accept that you do agree rape and forced prostitution are wrong. He isn't doing this anymore, so you don't have to change his mind to prevent it from happening again. I don't think he was being intentionally dishonest by not telling you before; it sounds like he really thinks about it differently that you do. 

I'm sorry you're dealing with this and hope things get better for you soon!"
This post is on point. 5years. Fuck.  I'll be 30 in five years ~ I better be giving my life to my dream and with a family or by myself. 
"*sigh* Yeah. That. 

(I'm going to start keeping a scrapbook of all the reddit posts where I say something in twenty long-winded paragraphs and then the next poster chimes in with all the same ideas in a few, easily comprehensible sentences.) "
"Thanks for your comments. It's hard not to feel like I'm not providing enough when she talks about stuff being 'missing'. Like I'm broken or something. When I look at it objectively I can see that it's manipulative and nasty behavior, but this is the same girl who spent weeks and weeks making me handmade birthday presents and who would be excited to spend a weekend watching me play The Last of Us. It doesn't add up in my mind."
"&gt; But she chose the moment that you were down on one knee with a ring to say she needed to fuck other people?!  The moment that should have been a wonderful and beautiful memory and she does it then.

Jesus. Can you even imagine?

"To be fair, as an IT person myself, I've had some HORRIBLE experiences contacting other companies for support. 

Some IT people are just assholes. And some users are idiots. Both of these things are holy truths."
"I had to go back and read the ages, I was convinced that I had somehow read 29 and 30 when they are actually 19 and 20. WTF

I would immediately fall out of love with someone who has dumbo friends like this and who did not check them hard about this. If not then, then immediately after being asked to forgive the dumbos. I would immediately stop talking to dumbo friends. I mean really, they would cease to exist to me as general people. People in their late 20s/30s should not act like this, you guys are good and grown, not teenagers or new adults.

How to get over it? Put a pause on the wedding planning for as long as you need to. I would be very wary about marrying someone who finds this acceptable behavior from his friends (they put hands on you after all) and expects you to forgive them."
That's because most fathers don't *ask* for custody.
"If you call your boyfriend ""Jackass"" as a pseudonym in a post asking for relationship advice and it's not because of some acute indiscretion...then all I conclude is that he's consistently a jackass.

You're not married, so get out.

I'm sorry that you'll have to leave the dog, but maybe ask him after a year or so without contact if you can take the dog?  He definitely won't agree while you're breaking up with him.  He'll treat the dog as a bargaining chip."
"If this is your child (as per paternity test), you *are* stuck to her forever as a co-parent. You're not getting closure. You made a person.


She might not have her act together right now, but you have the power to be the grown-up in this situation. It looks like you've already taken steps to clean up your act. Continue to be that person. If you show the people in your life (family members, friends, faith community) that you're ready to step up and be a responsible and honest adult, they will be more likely to help and support you.  "
"Thanks for your comment. I have been with him 6 years and it happened maybe once or twice before within those years. It was freshers week in college, so a lot of drink going around, I hardly drink. I remember once he actually took me to his home and helped me, and was there for me. 

Maybe he just doesn't love me anymore, and this is just a sign to show this, that he doesn't want to be there for me. I am more upset of the fact he made fun of me and was looking down on me, and that he hasn't bothered to see if I am okay today. I think it is cruel"
"No, you don't get to ""believe"" in science or medicine. It is black and white. Fairy tales, yes you can choose to believe in. Science-backed disease, no. There are things out there that are undeniably true, and the fact that vaccines have helped eradicate a large number of terrible diseases is one of them. You're just being ignorant."
"Yup. I am not a dr., but I used to practice law, and I was living paycheck to paycheck when I was working at a large law firm earning bank. All my $$ went to rent and student loans. I was still poor as all fuck. Still living a student lifestyle. I was just wearing suits, had a secretary, and worked in a fancy office."
"Well shes constantly asking for advice... but never listens to any of it. For example she'll complain that she cant afford the expensive healthy meals bs - I told her that I can teach her healthy and tasty recipes - theyre cheap and so easy to make too and she can freeze and use them during workdays - no she doesnt have time for that. 


I told her we can have morning and nightly pilates sessions - no shes too tired to do them during the week day and weekends she has to fuss over a date who might or might not turn up. 


same thing with guys. She'll ask me for advice constantly and you can usually judge a guy from the way hes talking to you - so Ill warn her that the guy is not interested in anything other than a fling or being a fuck buddy at most and she'll think Im ""too negative"" ""too judgemental"" than shell come crying to me later on. 


SO really I want her to stop asking for my advice."
"Do you ever ask him leading questions like, ""what was something good that happened to you today?"" or ""is there anything you feel grateful for in your life today?"" or whatever? (maybe phrased less hippy-ish? lol)"
He didn't say anything at all about her health.
"Might want to be VERY clear on the 'joke' part though, she may decide to take it as a go-ahead."
"Um, if you really believe the simplest explanation is the most likely, then I'd say in this case, the simplest explanation IS that he has another life. You don't know his friends or family, you see him three hours once a month, and this doesn't seem shady to you? "
"&gt; She never told him her number. She very easily could have tried sexual stuff with one partner and figured out her sexual preferences that way.

I don't think OP ever mentioned that her bf thought the number was the problem. You're the one bringing the actual number up. I doubt the situation would be very different in the scenario you described."
"I wish I was joking. It wouldn't be funny, but it would sure hurt a lot less."
"Tell her you've noticed a difference in her smell and taste lately, and you've noticed a disturbing trend between giving her oral and getting throat infections. You're worried that you may be passing some sort of bacterial infection back and forth between you two. You'd like to visit the doctor to get things sorted on both ends so you can go back to giving awesome oral without worrying about this stuff becoming drug resistant. 

She probably going to be embarrassed, but this stuff happens to everyone. Tell her it's no big deal, but it does need to be taken care of before it becomes a bigger problem. If she refuses to see a doctor, you refuse to perform oral. Her sexual pleasure does not trump your physical health. 

If your theory holds true and you get another infection soon, tell the doctor this happens every time you perform oral on your girlfriend. They'll want to run an STD panel to make sure it's not something serious, but it's probably just a case of BV."
"But he didn't set someone up to say something racist, he did himself.  And actually the mean girls quote is off--it's that Karen can't ask someone why they're white. 

If I were you I would take a hard look at a boyfriend who thought that my racially diverse upbringing entitled him to make offensive jokes (I noticed you didn't address the Asian comment). My second family (it's complicated lol) has five adopted black kids. And I find it shocking the number of people who think that this makes it cool to say random, racist shit to me. 

Maybe he's just an entitled, oblivious white guy, but anyone worth your time will listen and learn instead of doubling down on their jackass-ery. "
"You allowed her home to be invaded by ugly unopposed bigotry. 

Shame on you.

"They owe the baby not the women.   He can be as non monogamous as he wants, his bio.child is entitled to support.  If he doesn't want pay to he should keep his sperm to himself."
And they would pay for her...?
"Nope. You're stuck with him forever now, sorry. You're going to have to keep going through this cycle indefinitely. "
"I experienced something very similiar to this. I was honest and let him know what I came across. He tried to play it off as if he had no idea what I was talking about, and then became apologetic claiming he was going to cut her from his life. I give him credit, as he didn't respond to her constant ""I need you in my life"" messages, but the second we broke up (years later) he fell back into her arms. Smarten up, girl. There are plenty of handsome, charming men out there who don't have nudes of their ""friends"" on deck.  "
"I can't tell you how many people said, ""well *I* better be invited,"" after we said we were having a super small wedding.

"That's what jumped out at me.  He's been out of high school for six years.  Why are they still talking about this supposed ""rebellious phase""?  

I think OP might want to look into the ""flying monkey"" concept.  These people have been pretty heavily influenced by OP's dad and are still doing his dirty work for him, bashing OP for stuff from the past.  Some boundary enforcement is going to be necessary to get them to knock it off."
"No one is saying communication is key. However, as OP had said, his wife is not communicating. Every time he brings it up, she shuts him down. What we're all saying is that OP is justified in feeling frustrated and that his wife is being ridiculous, especially because she isn't open to talking about it."

"Yeah, he needs to understand that that's a time and a place, and restricting the kinks to a time and place is appropriate *and* desirable. 

He's got to reign it in. "
I just read through the last post and OP mentions in a comment that it is indeed a family company. I think you have a point there. 
"You say this happened 5 years ago. Obviously you don't believe his explanation, never have, and don't trust him. 

At this point, 5 years later you need to think about what you want. Do you just want to know the truth and are planning on staying with him no matter what? Will you leave him if you find out that he was cheating on you? 

You know that your husband's ID didn't get mixed up. You know that was him having those conversations. I mean, I assume that when you originally saw the messages they sounded like they were written by him. Knowing this, what is your goal here and what do you want from this? "
"I have to ask- you've been together for 6 years and you've never 69'd?!

"yeah, I don't think it's an overreaction. That's a really long period of time for her parents not to hear from her, especially if they typically get something within 24 hours from her? Also, I can't imagine my parents' first instinct to be to email me if they don't hear from me. Cops might've been an overreaction, but probably the easiest solution (might not be clear who to contact at the dorm, etc).

Also, OP, I really think your sister needs to be the one to communicate with your parents about the issues in their relationship. Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like if you bring it up you'll probably get dismissed as they have no indication your sister has an issue with their relationship (as far as I can tell). 

I do think this issue should be addressed separately as a one off, because like I said, 5 days is a really long time. It sounds like this is more of a breakdown in communication and a gap in what to do between no response --&gt; cops involved."

"It doesn't matter, what matters it's that he doesn't want to be with you. So leave him alone, move on and stop obsessing"
"I would agree they are low end. For the same money, he could probably go to Asian restaurants (not sushi though), Mexican or Indian places. Places like Red Lobster and Logan's Roadhouse are more middle class (*edit, I mean middle of the spectrum for chain restuarants, not that middle class only eat at these types of places*). And then Chris Ruth's Steak House and McCormick and Shmick are higher end. If we are talking chain restaurants. If cheaper chain restaurants is what he likes, that's fine, but it's not really quality. 

"
So I should start as I've never given birth. Yikes. 
"Ugh, that sounds exhausting to deal with. 

You can tell him that you really dislike when he does this to you, and that it's annoying as fuck that he can't answer a simple question without being deceptive.

But he seems to take great joy in evading questions, and I think that's a bad sign. He's not an honest guy."
"&gt; its not bad that you get a sex toy to help bring your sex drives more in line with one another, but you still have to consider her feelings on things  
  
Maybe she wants him to want to have sex more often than she actually does so she feels wanted.   
Like how people like to be chased/pursued sometimes.  
She may associate him wanting her and her sometimes shutting him down or being unattainable as being ""Wanted"".   
Now it is like *""No, not tonight, I'm feeling a little tired""* and OP is like *""Yeah, cool, np, be back in 15, just gonna hit up the fleshlight, ttyl""*   
And she's just like :/  
Maybe she actually liked the power of feeling in control of their sex lives as a result of her having the lower lobido and now associates that with feeling desired."
"Though anecdotal, the way you are writing and your arguments, as well as your paranoia, sound exactly like those of an ex boyfriend from college who developed schizophrenia. Eerily so. I would recommend at least talking to a doctor, though I know how difficult that can be when you are so sure you're okay, and the problem is someone else. 

In the case of my ex, I was the ""problem"", not his mental health, and after several scary events where he threatened my life because he was so sure I was doing something to him, I ended up having to press charges, get a restraining order, and move 1000 miles away. 

Please at least get checked out. "
"Let me break this down.

1. You still had a thing for Adam when you got with Jay.
2. You never ceased contact with Adam during this relationship. He was a source of contention in your relationship with Jay and he asked you to cease contact with Adam. You said you would, you lied and continued to talk to Adam behind his back. You blamed this on Jay being busy while taking no accountability for your deception.
3. You question if you are truly in love with Jay.
4. You continue to talk to guys on KIK without Jay knowing – claim it’s all “innocent” even though they are sending you naked pictures, which you delete claiming you want a “fresh start” with Jay. You never tell him about any of this or very little, and when you do come clean, you have excuse after excuse - project the blame onto him and then go right back to your same behavior. You learn nothing, you fix nothing.
5. You don’t get to disagree with what someone else’s definition of cheating is. You continued to talk to these people on KIK after Jay found out &amp; expressed he had an issue with it. 
6. Three weeks ago, you got BACK in touch with Adam.  You continued talking to Adam, hid the app you used to talk to him from Jay &amp; claimed this was “all very innocent.”  It doesn't even sound like you've ever even met Adam offline, tbh but you are continuing to disrespect your relationship with Jay over this. Nothing about your behavior is ""innocent"" with Adam. 

These are not mistakes, these are CHOICES. You have a consistent history of being dishonest and pining for another guy while with Jay. While Jay pressuring you for sex is NOT kosher by any means, you have fucked up the trust in this relationship, in my opinion, beyond all repair. I have no idea why he has not broken up with you at this point. 
"
I have never heard of love-bombing - what does that mean? 
"I like this idea, but maybe let management know before hand. 
""Hey boss, I've been having some issues with a colleague speaking to me in a less than professional manner. I believe I can manage this myself and will conduct myself respectfully and professionally at all times, but I  just wanted to give you the heads up."" 

Harry sounds like the sort to lodge a complaint of OP being belligerent once OP starts being more assertive. "
"Honestly, what I'm seeing here is you dropping hints and expecting him to be a mind-reader rather than you sitting him down and being specific in what to expect. Your grandparents sound waaaaaaaaaaay out of the normal order of things and I agree with your bf that you didn't prepare him sufficiently."
"""Ultimately good people"" don't hurl insults. And saying it's ""pretty clear they don't *really* mean it"" is a bullshit cop out. Their intent doesn't matter if other people are hurt by it. "
"&gt; This also disturbs me because I feel like in the past I would have very vehemently stood up for what I believed in. Now, I tend to acquiesce to what he says in hopes of avoiding conflict.

Yeah, I think this is a problem that's going to get worse, not better.  At best, do you want to constantly have to re-negotiate your own independence? Constantly have to hope your clothes/diet/friends/colleagues meet his approval, or brace yourself to be attacked defending your basic autonomy. At worst, this is looking like a nasty progression.

eta: I would consider adding this to your post, frankly.

Also, I don't think a boyfriend should ever seem ""more like a parent"" (unless that's what you're into, I guess)--but would a good parent call their daughter slutty?  Would a good parent say wearing an outfit she liked was ""unforgivable""?  "

And now, during your first meeting in years, which only happens after she realizes you two are now connected to a rich family, she starts hinting she wants money. Your sister may have her faults, but her anger seems justified. What sort of person sends a Facebook message like that to her own daughter?

It must be so hard to have been abandoned and rejected. I'm sure you really want a genuinely remorseful mother who missed you and wants you, but that's not what's happening. Listen to your sister and your grandma. Don't let your dreams mislead you."
"Wow.

OK, this is *one man's opinion* not god's truth, but:

Honestly, I think she has been planning this divorce for a while. College was her way out, her excuse to bail. 

IMHO this marriage was over before she even got there.

Prepare for divorce. Sorry. And anyway, fine art theatre sucks you in 101%, you'd lose her one day when she gets in to it properly"
Do you think backyard breeders are bad because they have bad intentions?  No. It's because they cause harm regardless of intentions. 
"Well, make the appointment. Then sit down with your husband and say, ""I've made an appointment for my hearing. I'm sorry if I should have sooner. I'm worried that we'll keep fighting before I can get to the doctor. Can we figure this out?"" 

And go from there. Sorry, but that's all you can do. I'm sorry you're going through this. I hate going to doctors so I'm not going to give you shit over that, whatever your reasons were. Although, I have to go get my long overdue physical, so, good luck!"
"If your family has been in denial about his symptoms for...25 years or so? however long it's been clear that his behaviour was off, they're hardly going to change now. Your best bet is convincing your brother that he needs help. He's an adult and has surely noticed that he is different.


I have a friend who was diagnosed with Aspergers in her early 30s, and another who was diagnosed with ADHD at 38, so it does happen. If he is functional enough to manage his routine medical care he is able to handle this too."
"Get treated for your depression.  Not to sound harsh, but music is not a viable career for 99.9999% of the people who love it.  Do not bank on that.  Get yourself some job skills/training, keep the music as a hobby and THEN try to make money from it when you can financially support yourself.  The same goes for art.  I have a very talented friend who quit her job to do art...and she only managed this because her husband works and she still ended up taking part time work to make ends meet.

You have to get treated for the depression.  It is clouding everything.  It's hard to study under that cloud.  It's hard to do anything.  You're listing a lot of things that would make great hobbies, but aren't going to put food on the table.  See your doctor and then sit down with an academic adviser to see if there is a program that would be a better fit than your old one.  At least try to get back to school and take your general classes.

I more or less dropped out of school at 20.  Depression was the cause, only I didn't understand it at the time.  I absolutely regret it.  It set me back years career wise. I'm 34 and now trying to finish a Bachelor's while balancing full time work and a husband and 2 kids.  It's HARD.  So hard.  Get your school done while you're young and relatively unencumbered. "

"The only think I can think of is your boyfriends should get married (and here's why). If a child is born it will have to involve you (Unless there is a 4th party). You will be it's mother (In the eyes of the law). This way, both of your boyfriends will be tied to the children as Mather &amp; step father. Now step father is in no way the same as a normal father in the eyes of the law, but it would at least give both a connection to the children on paper. 

Aside from that you;re kinda out of luck. Sorry."

"Yeah, it's like he isn't allowing her to feel abandoned. Even if this was a more clear ""smart move"" scenario - for example, if she was drowning and he couldn't swim, so he ran from the shore to get a lifeguard instead of him jumping in and them both drowning - maybe she would still feel abandoned against logic. As in, ""You did the right think and saved my life and I'm glad you didn't jump in - but it still felt bad at the time to see you run away - how do I process this?"" And a good partner would allow her to feel that emotion and work through the traumatic experience with a counsellor."
"&gt; we all find it ridiculous that these moments were ruined by a jerk with a phone.

A jerk with the phone who wanted to capture a photo of the moment, too? Yes, the bride and groom requested ""no cellphones,"" which is ridiculous on its own and not something I've seen at any wedding I've been to, but they're really mad about this? 

&gt; We all think this is a great idea, but Amy is worried about backlash.

That's because you don't actually have a stake in any of this. It's amusing to you. Amy is right to be worried about how people will respond, because such a move will make her look petty and vindictive."
Treat it like driving: Don't stop until red.
I think the OP said in the original post that the parents were very strict with Nate and spoiled Natalie. Sounds like they have the classic RBN GC/SG dynamic going on.
"""Hey, Kenny? You're a nice person. However the fact that you are saying 'I love you' and buying me a RING after dating me a week is honestly way overboard. We know nothing about each other, and you're moving so fast it's scary. I don't feel the same way about you, so it's best if we part ways and move on."" 
 
If you want to condense it: 
 
""Kenny, we're not on the same page here, and it's best if we part ways."" 
 
He' will demand to know why, he will beg for another chance, he will ask ""why"" 1000 times. You don't have to say anything, or you can just say ""We're just not compatible,"" or ""I need to move on."" 
 
If you want a more honest approach, you can say ""It's been a week of dating and you are telling me you love me and you bought me a ring - that is way too much, way too fast, and I am just not comfortable in this situation anymore."" 
 
There are a lot of ways to do it, but the key is to make it 100% crystal clear that your decision is FINAL, and then block him. (Otherwise he will pester you to death, and if you even send him one little text, even to say ""leave me alone"", he will say ""Hooray! She responded! I've got her attention! It's only a matter of time and i can win her back!"" So DON'T give him the chance.)"
"But she's not miserable. That is a fact. OP even says so, but he even denies his own observations and says she ""must be"". "
Grandparents? Any teachers at school you have a close relationship with?
Well not that it can never happen but the husband is going to have to put in a lot of effort and backbone breaking labor to get that trust back possibly in the form of therapy to figure out what is really plaguing him and to confront the demons of the past so that he can begin healing.
"It's weird of you to add that apparently ""most of your straight male friends like you in a sexual way"". A totally weird and likely inaccurate comment. You are also conflating sexual attraction with an instance of sexual assault. Not the same thing. "

"Really? Like genuinly curious. 

If two male friends who you had known in your 3 years sexually harrased and groped you, you would laugh it off? And if when you went to your fiance he decided that their reason for doing it was fine? "
"Show him this thread then. If he reacts badly, like you are worried about, then you need to do a lot of thinking. You still in contact with that therapist?"
"You did the right thing, buddy, for her. She deserves to be with someone who isn't going to judge her based on her sexual history. Whether you did the right thing for you? I doubt it. You could've just lost someone amazing over a number.

"My first car was a 2001 Subaru Forester. Yeah, maybe I would've wanted something newer and a bit less ugly; regardless, I grew to love that thing and cried when it had to be scrapped due to its condition. Your brother is very ungrateful, and I think that you should take the car away. In a few months all of his friends will be driving beaters, and he's going to regret his actions. Better to have a crappy car than no car. I mean, I drive a beater now but it's mine (legally it's my parents' but I bring it to school with me, 3 hours away from home), and I love it. I would never turn my nose up at an older car if i couldn't afford to do so."
"And you can, in the future. But not right now, no. 

As you've said yourself, ""you have no one to blame"". It sucks, but that's life. Often, our actions have consequences that require us to do things we didn't want to do, and change the plans that we had for our lives."
"I don't think the specific lie is really relevant at all. He could just say he wanted to live where his father was, he didn't like the schools where his mother was, he wanted a change of scenery, there are a million things that could've easily hidden it - I don't think nitpicking at that particular lie is helpful at all."

Yes you are. Your entire post is basically the definition of homophobia.
"There was just a post yesterday where an older man asked about dating a younger woman. 

The responses were nice, but told him to be cautious. And to follow the Campsite Rule. "
"Total creep move. That seriously fucking sucks. I wouldn't even know how to approach it. So unfair of them to put you in such a ridiculous situation. Were you relatively good friends with her before the incident? I would create the opportunity for a dialogue given the fact that he is your brother, but seriously that's fucking beyond creepy. I have siblings and I am sure my brother would freak the fuck out if his spouse tried making sexual advances towards me. Such a shitty situation. "
"Oh man, last night I could hear my neighbors yelling and I was so annoyed by it, but then the younger (20 years old) brother knocked on my door. ""Hey, my brother and I are getting high and playing madden and it gets a little rowdy, I'm sorry if you can hear us."" Instantly not mad anymore, and I just turned my TV waaaay up and chilled. I live in a ""ghetto adjacent"" area, so I lucked out with the four other apartments in my paper thin building. One of the girls downstairs does knock on our door to move the lizards off her porch a little too often, though. "
"He could have been a bit retaliatory with his reaction, but he was still coming to terms with her hiding her whole sexual history.  A big part of herself wasn't known to him.  "
Thank you so much. It really sucks.
Please encourage her to post here so we can encourage her to divorce this loser.
Hahaha win win for everyone  
Maybe hearing their experiences with drugs would have helped give him some perspective.
"He is NOT neglected. I quit a lucrative job to stay home with him for almost two years when he first got in trouble, and started a home business. My husband got laid off, so I quit the business, still in its infancy, and went back to the old job immediately. My husband got hired again within a couple weeks. 
I just started grad school three weeks ago, and am trying to get everyone used to the schedule. My mother run law comes over every single morning to get the kids off to school, since we are with off to work at five am and my husband gets home soon after school gets out. You can fuck off with you accusations of neglect."
Nothing has ever happened at the actual office. He honestly acts really normal (besides from being somewhat goofy in general) during working hours. All of this stuff has happened after some sort of work-related event though. 
"A girl he knew from a while back... met up with him at a bar... and just so happened to give him a book?

I'm a girl. I go to bars. I have guy friends. I even think PUA is interesting. I CANNOT IMAGINE A UNIVERSE where it makes sense to give a guy *in a relationship* a book on picking up women... unsolicited. "

"Hey OP. I'm a higher libido lady with a lower libido male spouse. 

This is a hard issue. We've worked on it a lot and are in a really good place. Btw - we DEFINITELY schedule sex and it works great for us. 

There's a lot in your post, and that sounds like a lot to deal with. But I just want to say one thing:  you want to feel loved. So does your husband. It sounds like he experiences love and closeness through sex. 

I'm 100% not saying you have to have sex with him. But when those of us with higher libidos get rejected by our partners consistently, we can feel constantly in pain and seperate from our partners, and it hurts a lot. I bet you anything that your husband wants to connect with you. That's why he initiates sex. The problem is that sex and the way he initiates don't make you feel connected. Other things do - things that don't make HIM feel connected. 

He's not ""thinking with his cock"" - he's acting from the heart. Not in a very self aware way, for sure. 

You two don't understand each other. Which is understandable!  But you keep saying the same thing to each other over and over again: connect with me, make me feel special, make me feel wanted, make me feel loved. And neither of you hear each other. And both of you end up hurt over and over. 

You don't have to stay. If you don't want to touch him anymore, that's ok. But do know that he's not just some asshole who doesn't care. It's just that you each show and appreciate caring in REALLY different ways, and I promise that he's hurting too."
"That feeling you're having? It's because you made a stupid mistake and were hurt by it.  
Now's the time to make those mistakes. The long-term effects here are nil, and there are a lot of other great women out there.  
So now that you know how this feels, learn from the experience and don't do something stupid like that I your next relationship."
"I absolutely agree with you. 

I meant more like throwing things or screaming. 

Crying is a 100% biological/physiological reaction to certain emotions. 

It's like sneezing or yawning. I hate that people are ashamed of it. I hate that some people shame criers. I also hate that some people think crying is under a person's control. Those people are not criers and assume crying is for manipulation purposes. "
"The ""for free"" part is no small thing here. I would have to pay extra to have an au pair and a languages tutor. To have two in one for free where the kid gets to learn one on one from a caretaker is a gift and should be treated as one. 

I feel like even a racist should be able to see that it's good that you have the ability to speak another language. You can eavesdrop unexpectedly or go on a racist tirade they will understand or whatever it is racists do."
You think they should pay for her? Why?
"Seriously, I was going to say the same thing. Next time she mentions it just give her a sympathetic/patronising smile and maybe a tap on the shoulder. Or just say something like ""you still going on about that? Jesus, get over it"" and then just walk away or sit there and ignore anything else she says. The only way this grown up child will understand is to treat her like a child, if a kid has a tantrum you ignore it until it stops. "
"The sad thing is, a lot of people think birth control, at all, is a bad/sinful/slutty/whatever thing, even if it's taken to treat something completely unrelated."
exactly. This is not a person I would want in my life. How ever could you trust her? Such poor judgement.
You're not in the socioeconomic strata you believe yourself to be.  
"Your husband has been a good actor.  He isn't the man you thought he was, he never was that man.

Get a good Divorce Attorney.  Get your divorce.  Spend time mourning the relationship you thought you had.  Get some therapy to realize the problem was never you.  Be cautious with your heart, while still being hopeful.

Your mom's mom is a real piece of shit and rotten person. Tell your brother and mom. They obviously are in fact your family. 
"&gt;when they call again, ""is this all you guys do? Do you guys just sit at home all day thinking about me? That's pretty creepy, I thought you'd be over me already..""

This is perfect.  I know the supposed high road is ignoring them, but I think OP deserves a little satisfaction first.  I really like the idea of pointing out how pathetic this is and how you can see right through it.  If he's so happy with this girl, why does he feel the need to contact you about it?  He's not over you, and the fact that this girl is participating is so sad and pathetic.  People in a healthy happy relationship wouldn't do this.  All they're doing is showing you what losers they are.

Make sure you're keeping track of every time this happens.  Write down everything you can remember right now, and be as specific as you can including dates and times.  Keep the texts and FB messages. If this continues, go to the police.  This is criminal harassment, and you could probably get a no contact order pretty easily.

Edit: also, engaged at 18?  Hahahahahahahaha!  That's totally going to last."
"I feel like he was when i drunkenly threw in his face that I knew, he admitted a lot. 

His mom had been a depressed mess and started drinking when his dad left and he got angry and she kicked him out. He couch surfed and smoked pot, ended up running out of couches and living on the street for a little bit on and off util his dad found him. 

It matches what his sister had told me, but its the ease in which he had lied that gets to me. Everyone we know together here knows his background as this lie since we met them together. 

The fact that he had to research shopping mall floor plans so he could pretend he had lived there when he took me. like seriously, who does that?"

Wish I could downvote this more than once.
"My (very Dutch) partner is 6'7"". I am not kidding you when I say that in the Netherlands, he really didn't stick out. In Italy where I live and where he's moving soon, people actively stare at him and talk about him :( "
"Maybe try a chore chart with stickers. Or base his allowance on how many chores he does in a given week. Or if the positive reinforcement doesn't work, a timeout can be effective -- you can do one minute for every year old he is.

OH WAIT, he's not your kid, he's supposed to be your fucking partner! Guess what, no one WANTS to do the dishes, but they do because that's a part of being a fucking adult. I hate this fucking shit.

ETA: I'm angry on your behalf, OP. You should not be asking ""how do I incentivize adult behavior"" or ""how do I not hurt my bf's feelings when I call him out on not being an adult"". Sit your bf down and ask him how exactly he proposes that you two live. Make him SAY that he wants you to do all the housework, because make no mistake, that is what he wants. I'd give him the benefit of the doubt that he just doesn't know how to adult... except he called you a nag and refuses to do things when you straight up ask him. He wants a mom, not a partner, and you should not put up with any of this shit. I, an unconcerned party, should not be more outraged over this than are you, the slave/mother in question."
That's my point. It's none of your business what is normal or not normal and if she is acting normal. Everyone is different but more importantly don't burden her with your emotional reaction and judgement/speculation of her behavior. 
So... clearly you and your boyfriend have an expiration date on your relationship fast approaching...
"'Mom have I done anything like this before? No. People who are crazy or act out on this don't just go crazy in one day. There is no reason for me to destroy a laptop. If you are concerned still shall we try family therapy for all of three of us so we can talk about our feelings in a safe and open environment?' Or at best whatever you say, always be calm and be concerned in return. 

Maybe also at 20 start to save up and think about moving out. There's only so much you can do in home which is frantic and best option is to move away from that environment "
"That's what I was thinking: the friend heard the sob story from OP's boyfriend and probably didn't get a very factual version. ""All I did was mention my beliefs, I don't know why OP is overreacting!"""
"This is one of those times when I advise kids that sometimes getting grounded is worth the stand you are taking.  I got punished as a kid for doing things I felt was right.  This might be a time for your brother to understand that if you believe in something strongly enough, it might be worth the grounding. It might also be time for your brother to learn that just because the girlfriend says he's grounded, if your dad's too drunk too enforce it, good luck with that. I don't generally advocate open rebellion to minors, but if the adults are insane, sometimes you have to draw lines in the sand so as not to get taken advantage of. "
"Let me give you a possible warning. 

This is isolating behavior. Ive read the comments this far. It isnt about alcohol use or hangovers or feeling bad the next day. 

What will happen is eventually you will have anxiety when thinking about going out because you know the whinefest you will have to deal with the next day. It may not be on purpose but the results will be the same. You won't be as willing to go places. You will be resentful that he feels the need to complain about everything. 

Stop it right now. Tell him it makes you upset when he complains for days about going somewhere. And he needs to adress this. Is he in pain? If so he needs to see a doctor. Is he complaining because he didn't want to go? If so then he should stay at home. But you will be upset he doesn't want to go on these dates and activities with you. 

If he doesn't change his attitude you may consider breaking up. My ex did the same thing until over the years I didn't want to go. Funny enough HE still went but only complained when I went too. And then he started to complain because I never went anywhere with him. It was abusive at that point, no matter what I did I was wrong and he blamed me. 

Of you have that sort of relationship you can attempt to snap him out of it by telling him to stop going or stop whining. He needs to get over it. Or find a much nicer way to say it. Either way confront him and if its just whining shut him down. "
"Tell her if she won't go to counseling with you work on this, or have sex with you, you are going to file for a divorce. "
"My mum was the same and I get really stressed when trying to work out new things. Its like my brain just clams up and says ""nope, too hard,"" without even trying to break it down into simple steps.

If someone shows me how to do it im often suprised at how easy it is to do and wish id learnt it earlier"
"You are much, much more level headed than I could ever be in your situation.  
Congratz on not just blowing up.  
I wasn't actually saying your wife was the instigator of the accident. I meant that the BF had other motives, especially if he knows you guys want kids only between yourselves.   
Seems a bit of a coincidence to me that this happened after you guys decided to start getting ready to have them.   
Honestly my first thought if I was in the BF's shoes would have been, oh shit  morning after pill and anything else."
"If she's open to abortion, that's going to be your best, cleanest option here. No mess of raising another man's kid, no dealing with his input on adoption, no dealing with the possibility of him taking the kid and your wife owing him child support, no physical ordeal of pregnancy and recovery, no having a fuck-buddy be part of your lives for the next 18-to-life.

Yes, it can come with some emotional baggage, but probably less than any of the other options on the table."
"&gt;he had the right to be mad at me for aborting his baby

Not sure I agree. Upset, yes, mad and abusive, no.

Call your parents. They will want to know, holiday or not.

As you say, this might NOT be the moment to file police charges. It was self defence but without witnesses it could backfire. But do take photos of the damage he did in case he does.

good luck. You did the right thing, under incredible pressure not to."

"When exactly did these nomenclature protocols for parents go into effect in North America? Apparently a lot of us missed that. FYI, ""Mama"" damn sure isn't just baby babble if you live in the South or have family from there."
"It sounds like we have similar stress responses. I apparently inherited mine from my mom, who once chased a mugger for several blocks in high heels while screaming at him until a security guard at a nearby building registered what was happening and grabbed her to calm her down and snap her out of it. Responding like that can be just as maladaptive (if not more so) in dangerous situations, especially with muggings where the safest course is actually to behave exactly like OP did. You CAN learn to manage those stress responses, to an extent (my mom gave me a *huge* talking to about this after it emerged that I acted really stupidly in a particular situation), but it requires acknowledging them in the first place. "
"This is a truly fantastic idea. I think this is actually better than having the wedding at your place because they will have a memory and photos that are truly unique. Everyone has wedding pictures of the bride in her dress, surrounded by the bridal party, but nobody really has honeymoon photos that aren't sorta spontaneous/cell phone pics. Seems like a great way to showcase a new couple starting their lives together!"
"I would also talk to younger sis about this first, to prevent older sis from rubbing it in that OP is even considering it. "
"Drop her. She thinks she's better than you and probably everyone else. This is a clear indication of who she is and who she will be for the rest of her 'i'm better than most' life. 

Sorry to be so harsh but I just can't stand people like that. Especially when they can't afford anything they have unless someone else is footing the bill. "
"I'm not OP, but I would rather be proposed to with a Ring Pop than something that turns my finger green. If he didn't want to spend that much, he should've come right out and said it. She shouldn't have to tell him that being honest is important to her."
"Then your next step is to give him the bill for the carpet cleaning. If he refuses to pay it, your next next step is to file a claim in small claims court. It's really easy and usually has a small fee which he will have to pay back when he obviously loses."
"Yo she even mentioned she does this to family. Do you think she doesn't trust her family? This isn't about her relationship with you, it's about god damn money. 

""I feel like she's implying I'm temporary while she's waiting for someone better to come along""

Jesus, stop taking it so personally. If you need the money that badly, go to the bank and apply. If anything, it's a good sign she wants it in writing. It shows proper responsibility of her finances, something I certainly didn't have at her age (or now). "
"I second this comment. Discuss this with Anne (and possibly your fiance). 

Even if OP turns down the money, Mary might bring it up again in the future - to either Anne or OP's fiance. 

Lastly, OP - if you accept the money - be very clear somewhere that the money is NOT a loan from Mary. Get it in writing - you can phrase it as a wedding gift or whatever. Because I can picture Mary coming back 5 years later and asking for the $10,000 she lent OP for OP's wedding. "

"Um... yeah. At this point, it kind of is. The only thing that OP knows for sure is that his father started treating him differently from everyone else with no explanation, and then lashed out at him and left. There's no excusing that. "
"Yes! They were the ones to put you in this shitty situation, not you! You have no need to feel guilty at all. As women, we are raised with expectations to always mend fences and put our own comfort aside for the sake of other people's relationships. I think that is why you're feeling this way but it is not okay! This same feeling is the reason why a lot of rapes/assaults to unreported. The assailant is someone the victim knows and doesn't want to ""make waves"". Make waves, girl! You can stand up for yourself in this situation. I think your fiancé is being selfish. He forgave them because, ultimately, they had his best interest in mind. However, he needs to 1) consider your perspective and 2) even if he doesn't come to the same perspective, ultimately take your side anyway. He's not marrying these boys- he's marrying YOU."
How old is your kid?  It would have been a lot easier for your kid to adjust 6 years ago but sooner is always better than later.  
"You can do both if necessary. You don't yet know if this child is yours. However, if it is, you wouldn't be the first person to both work and go to college soon after becoming a parent. You will need to be organized and determined, because it will take a lot of hard work. 

But for heaven's sake, stop acting like your ex is the fount of all evil while you're an innocent little lamb. She may have introduced you to drugs, but you decided to use them (unless she forced you to ingest them every time). From what you wrote in your post, it sounds like you willingly slept with her despite being warned against her. Those were your decisions.

Part of being a decent person is facing up to your own mistakes and accepting responsibility. No one should be forced to have a child as a punishment; however, if your ex is pregnant by you and decides to give birth, then you will both be responsible for that innocent child. You can't be a decent person while ditching out of that responsibility just because your ex is someone you now despise. "

"So in fairly certain this will be buried, but I'm Seventh day adventist and the older generation (and much of the younger generation, depending on geography)  tends to be very conservative. You have every reason to be worried, especially if you aren't an SDA and, to a lesser extent, Filipino. If he doesn't know if they'll be okay with you sharing a room  I can almost promise they won't be. If you aren't Adventist be prepared for lots of thinly veiled stabs at your worthiness as a partner for your boyfriend, no matter how compatible you are or how good of a person you are. 

Adventism has a strong culture of legalistic behavior, and while it contains many people I love, respect, look up to, and care for, those same people have made my non-SDA boyfriend feel massively uncomfortable and have displayed a real ugliness. I prepared him as much as possible and made sure he always had a place to escape to or we had our own car to leave. If he grew up Adventist and hasn't brought home any non-Adventist friends or girlfriends before he might not be able to see that this culture could be a problem, but you guys need to hash it all out ahead of time. His family also may be like some of my family - totally welcoming and non judgy, but don't count on that unless he can lay everything or for you.

Before you go you need him to get you up to speed on what you can really expect from his family. Maybe they're like my parents and totally chill, or maybe they're like my grandparents and will be politely rude all week.  Get all the info AND insist he tell them ahead of time. Do not go if he won't do those two things. Do not go, even if you have to eat the cost of the tickets. 

A surprise houseguest at Christmas is so awkward even if they're welcome, and there's no guarantee you will be. Don't go if he can't give you answers and talk to his parents ahead of time. Just don't do it. "
"Try using the deer in the headlights tactic, when you are alone try to keep a passive or semi-stern face and ask her if she has anything to tell you. Her reaction should tell you everything."
"Absolutely same. Animals are a huge thing for me, and having a few is my desire. It would be a deal breaker in dating someone, for the sole reason that I understand not everyone desires to have a pet (let alone multiple!) as much as I do, but OP was nothing but upfront about this. 

His GF is being super shitty and manipulative. "
When she corrects the name you call her ask if she's the one that got knocked up by her cousin in '73 or was that her sister Madge.
"I'm 100% no to dogs or other pets. For me it's not something that could be solved by telling me about dogs or educating me in some way. I know the deal with dogs--they are a lot of responsibility to keep in a safe, healthy and happy way. I'm not willing to dedicate my time and energy to that. 

I'm fastidious about my house too, and no dog/cat home is ever as hair free as a non pet home (yeah even poodles). I don't want to clean up fecal matter or deal with marking or scratching or whatever but all of this pales in comparison to my very real understanding of the responsibility of keeping a pet happy and looked after.

Just adding the perspective of someone who is a firm no on dogs. I've met lots of nice dogs, it's not something I could be talked into, anymore than someone who doesn't want kids, even if they like kids. 

I would never manipulate by pretending to be into it though. You should never dangle in front of your partner a ""someday"" agreement if you've already decided no. It's just cruel.
 
I agree with those who say break up."
"I have guinea pigs because my landlord said no dogs, lol. They're very different creatures but I love having fur buddies again. "
"I would call his bluff: give him information on becoming emancipated. Offer to pay for attorney and court fees if he can meet the criteria. I was emancipated at 16 with the help of my father. It may not be necessary, some states have a more relaxed attitude toward 17 year olds. "
"I too have an autoimmune disorder and just want you to know that you aren't alone even it's not the same kind. (which it very well may be)

Anyway, I'm a bit confused by his response. You've discussed at length about the disorder and what exactly is with him, correct? 

If so, he certainly isn't listening and has only driven himself into a panic attack with his ignorance.

My best advice would be for you to just clearly state one last time what is and is not and let him know that you would appreciate his support right now instead of these wrong assumptions/accusations. 

This is a difficult time for you and (more) stress is the last thing you need and is in fact not helpful when dealing with this type of problem. 

If he doesn't in the immediate future turn his behavior around, I would probably focus on yourself and your health and possibly reevaluate if he is or is going to be capable of being  supportive partner you will need. 

PM me if you need to talk ever or if you want to know more about my story or have questions. Good luck to you."

"OP is talking about how her branch of Christianity doesn't press the issues of ""brimstone and hellfire"" as some denominations do. What do you teach about people who don't believe? Because to my knowledge, all Christianity teaches on the fact that unbelievers go to hell.

"&gt;Sorry, but it's bullshit that men have zero input in these decisions.

You know that women die from pregnancy, right? That pregnancy completely and forever changes your body? That 15% of women experience significant depression following childbirth? 

Because if you do know those things, but still advocate that another person (who will in no be at risk of death/depression/peeing every ten minutes) should be able to give a green light (or red light) to a forced pregnancy (or forced termination), that's pretty f'd up. No one should be forced to undergo medical procedures they do not fully understand and/or consent to. 

I'm not going to go on a long tirade of posts regarding this issue, but please consider this. You're basically advocating that women have fewer rights than dead people (since a dead person has body autonomy based on what they've consented to in their will/carried out by their executor)."
"I don't get why I basically said ""it's a bit condescending to assume those of us who don't agree just don't understand"" and in response I've been told twice now that I must not understand."
Lol I consider it more clever than cold. But yesterday was terrible so I think it's justified.
"I once had an ex who told me that the only reason I should ever turn down sex is if I'm throwing up because it takes so little from me and provides so much to him. Keyword in that sentence is ""ex."" In fact, I broke up with him the day after he said that to me.

Seriously, the belief that sex is a right is deep rooted in people who think like this and it's probably not going to change. It's fine to be a little disappointed if he was in the mood, it is unacceptable to be angry and childish about it."
It's possible there's no such rule pertaining to grad students. OP might want to check.
"&gt; She works very hard and started a new position at work so she's probably very tired and stressed.

That's 75% of it right there. She's a hard worker who's been working even harder lately, and that can be a real libido-killer, all else aside. So see if you can help out a bit more with chores, especially in the evenings. Double especially if you can do this on evenings when you're not trying to initiate sex, so that it doesn't come across like you feel you're ""owed"" for helping.

The other 25% is communication. You need to 1) tell her that you're feeling in need of more affection, and 2) ask her if there's anything stressing her out that you can help with."
Dude i read the first half of that shit. I would feel uncomfortable with him being my neighbor man. That shit probably will not got away and imagine how that kid is gonna react to having kids or just think do you want to be 40 getting thrown out of your freaking bed. Nothing about that seems relationship sustaining just cut and run man.
"&gt; he had sex with me while I cried big heaving sobs through the whole thing

Psychopath. This sentence makes my skin crawl.."
"Read the book called men who can't love it explains this situation extremely well. Essentially men who have commitment issues pull this stuff all the time. Some of them will even beg and plead for commitment but then once it happens they freak out and turn you into their enemy so they have an excuse to bail.

As for red flags I would look at prior relationships. Is he able to be friendly or cordial with his EX's. ( without going too far in the other direction and having inappropriate relationships with them). Does he speak well of them and say things like she was a great person but we just weren't compatible. Or does he trash them and call them psycho too clingy too needy or whatever and blame everything on to them?"
I think offending him is perfectly reasonable as his behavior is incredibly offensive to you and your profession. 
"Honestly, I don't think either of you are ready to be facing a real, adult marriage.  You're right that there's nothing wrong with crying as a stress release valve, and that snapping at you when you've reached that point isn't going to improve the situation.  But he's also got a point that it's frustrating to always have to be the one who keeps things together in times of stress.  And if this is happening frequently enough that it's become a recurring pattern, you need to try and figure out something more effective (like, say, planning out your studying far enough in advance that there's no question how much time you're going to need to finish up, or just plain not making any plans the weekend before a big deadline).  

Where you're both going wrong is not being able to understand where the other person is coming from and trying to come up with a constructive solution, rather than just focusing on the criticism and getting more and more upset with each other for feeling the way you do.  Once you've gotten through your assignments, you should see about taking advantage of your school's counseling resources, or seeking out premarital counseling on your own.  Because right now, you've both got a ways to go in terms of improving your communication and conflict management skills."
"Well, and it's funny, because he's trying to train the dog to respond to ""lay down,"" which is a two word command."
"yes they can change like that, they're called ""fantasies"" for a reason, and in the mind of men that reason is ""it made them horny one time when they saw it on the internet or in a movie"" - but in real life it's different and you might think about it and realize you really *don't* want that.

He probably just doesn't really care that much about it, is kind of ""eh, whatever, not really"" about it, more than saying no to appease you. It was probably just a stupid thing that caught his attention for a day and he talked to you about it half messing with you or just to see what you would say. People do that all the time."

"The thing is - and I am not trying to minimize the effect your abortion had on you - for most women, it *isn't* a traumatizing event. The most commonly reported emotion following an abortion is relief, and one of the Nordic states (don't remember which) did a massive longitudinal study that found that abortion is not correlated with negative mental outcomes, but giving birth is.

I'm not saying that abortion can't be traumatizing, or that women can't hold complicated feelings about or even regret their choice. But to unequivocally state that it's traumatizing is not correct."

Don't try to retaliate other than verbally standing up for yourself professionally. Keep doing what you have been and addressing issues with Becky to your supervisor.

My mother also invited my sister to my house - again, against my wishes - when my first child was born.

"Honestly... who cares when you lost virginity? It's not like you said you'd been with 100s of women before her, you fundamentally said you were inexperienced just like she was, but just futzed with the dates a bit.

If you want to come clean, feel free to do so. Something like ""I was embarrassed about when I really lost my virginity because I was worried you'd think less of me. It was actually at 30, not 19. I'm sorry for lying but when I tell people this it makes me worried that they'll think I'm a loser"" should work just fine.

"He gave you false hope because you, essentially, were begging for it. You went to him, pleading for a reason. When he'd already given you one. When he gave you another you essentially said: I don't care I can make it work even with that.

But for you to be pissed at him isn't really fair. You keep cornering him with your demands for an answer that makes sense to you, then you dismiss them when he offers them... 

Closure is not something someone else gives you. You have to make that for yourself.

"Seriously. I am in utter, absolute shock at the responses in this thread. I know this sub really really well, and never in a million years would I have predicted that 90% of people would think this was okay and even support it. 

I generally roll my eyes at both uber-feminists and men's rights activists because they're both very often just so extreme, but I'm finding myself thinking right now that- what if the genders were reversed? What if an op found her brother selling over and over, to countless men, something that its only possible uses are a) for men to con their girlfriends into staying/getting engaged when they don't want to and under a false premise, or b) used to con her out of $500+? You guys would say it's okay for the brother to do that? He just needs the money?"
"This top comment is not at all saying that she should get a divorce, just that she should talk to a lawyer so that she's aware of what she'd need to do.  Also ""talking things out"" is nice - but OP has already tried doing it and got ""I wish you were dead!"" thrown into her face for it.  Therapy is a form of talking things out with a mediator, and it's a logical next step after trying to work things out on your own doesn't work.

And I'm not sure why everyone thinks that ultimatums are so bad.  This guy is neglecting his three children and being an absolute monstrosity to his wife - if anyone needs an ultimatum it's him!  If that's what it takes to get him to be a father to his children, then it's worth it to threaten divorce."

He'd force them to fight the biggest guys and get shit on, and if they would continue fighting in school he would just stop training them. "

This is a little bit more grey. IF it is not true, your relationship with your brother, which you describe as close, might not be able to recover if you approach him from a stance of being pre-convinced of his guilt without even asking for his side. Worse still, he might be extremely hurt and betrayed that you are using this very serious allegation as something to further what he may view as an unrelated ""agenda"", getting him to forgive your mom."

"It's possible that she spun some story to her manager about how OP is abusive and she's scared of him, so she canceled his gym membership in a panic, even though that's against policy. The manager may have been okay with it ""just this one time"", as long as she follows through and gets a protective order against him -- he's an abusive and dangerous guy, see, and they don't want him coming around to ""harass"" her. 

This would also explain why her manager is apparently fully on her side in this situation. I mean, why would you ever want a client in your gym if you believe he's a domestic abuser and could possibly harm one of your employees? The protective order would simply be pursued to cover all their asses, including hers, since she wouldn't want her lies to get found out. "

You'd be surprised. Some people are just that conflict-avoidant.
I'm going to meet with him in a public place and tell him. The reason I'm struggling with this is because I hate letting people down. But this is just not okay. I don't feel comfortable at all.

"I've had a few coworkers come to me in the past with same problem. Same complaints as you: *management/coworkers are out to get me! I have no clue why! it's like this at every job!* My mom is also one of these people. 

Every single one of these people had one of two problems going on. The most common and often the younger ones was just laziness and a sense of entitlement. They couldn't take criticism as a suggestion of how to do better, they always assumed so and so was ""just out to get them."" To every coworker it is enraging to see the laziest one lament and ask why everyone is on their case. Where i work now her  name is Morgan. Everyone hates Morgan.

The other one is the problem my mom and a few acquantances from my past share. Basically she lets her anxiety and feelings dictate her reactions instead of logic. My mom works in a rehab facility. She called me one day lamenting how *mean* her boss is because he had the audacity to say ""what the fuck?"" She was full on playing the victim, had *no idea* why he would say that! After a series of questions here's what happened: They needed to do a fire drill. He was to get on the intercom, announce that this is just a drill:do not panic, and then my mom was supposed to pull the alarm. He went over with her how important it was the announcement occur first. Well, she pulled the alarm the moment the intercom came on, before he could say anything. All he said to her about the whole thing was the single ""wtf."" That's not so unreasonable. Unprofessional, yeah, but not a victim worthy reaction.

Is there *any* chance you're either of these people. You don't mention a single constructive criticism of yourself. What have your coworkers/managers criticized about your *professional* performance?"
I just think that treating people you love badly for their mistakes is a pretty crappy way to live.

"Okay real talk. I injured my back 2 years ago in a weight lifting injury and it CHANGED MY WHOLE LIFE.

Have you ever had serious back pain? I hope not. It is debilitating. I know what it's like to spend weeks horizontal and to have to rely on other people for everything. It sucks. It makes you feel like shit.

It makes you feel doubly shit when you're used to being an independant person. And even years after the injury your back is still a ticking time bomb. It can re-injure at any moment. I've thrown my back out vacuuming the floor, carrying groceries, even once just getting out of the damn bed. And every time has left me incapacitated for at least a week.

And the last fucking thing you want in the whole world is to go through it again.

She sounds scared. She doesn't want to hurt like that again so she is avoiding anything that could aggravate the injury. She's probably also depressed because, I dunno, she lost her whole identity and a big part of her life and now she's just kind of lost....

&gt;I've told her a few times that she seems really negative sometimes and complaining without pursuing solutions gets me down

But have you thought about how she feels?

&gt;then started whining again

Holy shit she's not whining. She sounds like someone who's gone through a trauma and gotten stuck.

She needs therapy and if you decide you love her and want her to get better you should encourage her to go back. And make sure it happens, whatever the cost.

Otherwise, leave. If you can't be there in sickness or in health then you shouldn't waste any more time.

EDIT: that came off quite harsh and I just wanted to acknowledge how hard it must be on you to constantly be in the care taker role without getting your needs met. That sucks, and leaving doesn't make you a bad person.

"You're right, there isn't anything in my post about the right way to initiate sex with me. I don't know what that would be. If I knew, I would tell him. You're right too about the damage is doing to him. We discuss the lack of sex issue often, and lately he has expressed worry that I don't find him attractive anymore. I tell him truthfully and often that he's hot, that I find him attractive, but I know words are a poor substitute for action. I do initiate with him, not as often as either of us would like obviously, but see my other responses for more detail on that."

"It's not specific to him; it's a general policy I have for guys I date. I'm just not interested in being in a relationship where I'm sexually unsatisfied. A lot of women I know will complain about low sex relationships as if there's an inherent libido mismatch; there usually isn't, their guy is just shooting his load all day privately.

I've never had a ""libido mismatch"" with a guy; they just cut off porn/masturbation and, tada, suddenly we're both interested in a lot of sex. 

I've also had several male friends experiment with going masturbation free when they felt they were having trouble being interested in women romantically and tell me the dramatic difference in their interest in not only sex but romance.

OTT it may be for our current cultural norm, but norm doesn't mean healthy."
I did go to a party a while back and he did get irrationally angry when he found out I danced with some random dude.
"I feel like a lot of girls view porn as this far removed from reality thing and instagram is real people with whom you can connect instantaneously. This is kind of tricky.

"Sometimes I do wish he didn't apologise. I feel like it was selfish of him to. I just feel like everything was constantly on his terms. I was around 5 and he was in his teens when it occurred. He did stuff (including blackmail) because he 'didn't know better'. Then he decided he was feeling guilty and really purposefully ignored me. Now obviously that sounds awesome that he ignored me but as a young child it was hella confusing, it really played into helping me completely block so much happening. So him apologising really feels like him trying to keep the ball in his court, cover up what happened - make sure I don't out him. 



I think his time of apologising made everything a lot worse. I was processing a very, very big loss of someone extremely close to me. It was one of those deaths where it creates a before and after in your life. Him apologising then was just so stupid. I could barely process the death. Then to have all the memories swoosh back was horrific. I didn't even know if I was a virgin or not, if I'd been raped or not. 



I know that even without him apologising, and with my brain blocking things out. It still affected me. I was/am really anti touch. No hugs from anyone, really made a wide personal space circle. I didn't even know why but I just hated it. I think back to some weird things I did as a kid and can't figure out if I was just being an odd kid or if I was just messed up from what happened. 



I think the best case scenario for this according to my situation would have been if I spoke out as a child when it happened. I wish that something would've compelled me to tell someone. My cultural background doesnt talk about these things. So explaining myself when I was teen just didn't seem like an option. Plus everyone was horrifically affected by the death I mentioned earlier. It just wasn't an option. My abuser is a 'nice guy'. Everyone's favourite. A sweet talker. I thought it just wasn't an option for me to say anything. 



Me blocking things out meant that I still tried to hang out with my ''awesome'' older relative. I got super close to his now wife. It just got so messy. 



If he didn't apologise, and i continued on with life without remembering it could have been even worse. I could have had a real breakdown when the memories triggered at a different point of my life. 



If he didn't apologised I would have been messed up. He did apologise, and it still messes me up. It's one of those situations where something disgusting occurred and every alternative ending would have been awful.  Sometimes I'm ok with dealing with what happened, but I think it's my brain giving me a break and forgetting every now and then. Sometimes I'm so upset, that I can't get it out of my head and I wish he didn't apologise. Currently I'm just holding anger towards him when I think of him.


Overall it's just dumb. You don't do these things to another being. You leave kids alone. I do wish I had the guts to tell someone but it's to difficult and disgusting."

I agree that people our age have a past and baggage and I understand that.   But not being treated well is not something I will deal with.  I have a happy life by myself.  I would love to have someone to share it with, but they have to make it better,  not worse, otherwise, solo it is!"
"Wait, isn't OP the guy? "
"I was going to suggest this - your wife had no chance to be a teen or a young adult outwith what it means to be a mother.  As others have said, if your wife keeps on with this behaviour there is a very, very good chance that she will ruin the relationship with Rachel that she is trying so desperately hard to maintain.  

I'm sure she doesn't want Rachel to be 'that weird girl with the crazy mom'.  The thing is that she's never experienced college (I'm assuming, otherwise she wouldn't be behaving as she is) so she's likely completely unaware of how fundamentally damaging her behaviour is to Rachel's ability to form friendships and grow as a person.  Not only because she's never experienced it from Rachel's POV but she's never been in contact with people who might have had similar experiences with friends whose mothers have been so smothering.

You sound like a great dad and husband OP - I wish you all the best.

You know what's weak? Not having the balls to actually call on a friend for support from someone you would do the same for.

My dad is a truck driver and hit a bird one time while I was with him and the description given sounds totally reasonable to me. It was really sad and gross.
Not permanently I don't think (unless it's changed). When I was at college for my pro gardening qualification (so mostly mature students) there was a guy on a year's ban for drunk driving. He said he'd never have driven after 3 pints but after 10 he didn't even think about it. He was so grateful that he hadn't hurt anyone and very aware that he might have killed someone. Maybe his ban would have been longer if he'd had a different attitude. 
"I was prepared to tell you to suck it up after the first sentence, since the other bridesmaids are Jamie's friends and you were friends with the groom.

Why wait for the bride to be the bad guy and force you out?

"This sounds like a corny romance movie in which the female lead is at odds with the situation, and the male lead spends a good chunk of the movie trying to prove to her that he is a good man who would never hurt her.  The end, of course, is them getting married or at least ending up together.  

Since this isn't a movie, odds are your relationship won't last.  It sounds like he's into you, too (otherwise why would he come in for the kiss, actively kiss you for a few minutes and then call after you) but you are terrified of what could happen to your career (and possibly his?).  It sounds like that's what your concerns are, but I'm not sure.  Are you embarrassed?  Are you not sure how to act around him now?  Things will never be the same between you two, that's for sure, so you could totally avoid him or you could feel and act awkward around him or you could pursue a sexual (and possibly romantic) relationship with him.  Those are basically your three choices.  If you're hoping to be with him forever then, odds are, that won't happen.  It'll probably be a brief affair that will end badly (given the age difference and his position of power/authority).  Some people in your shoes would try to act like it never happened.  That can work, but it will feel awkward and tense--there will always be a pink elephant in the room.  If you don't want to pursue anything and you hate awkwardness then just avoid him.  He's not your supervising professor and you're not in any of his classes so just stop helping him with his admin stuff.  "

"This reminds me of that expression ""no good deed goes unpunished.""

Well, I don't exactly believe in that, because I do believe in doing good deeds. The problem is that many people are suspicious of others' motives, because they don't think they would do the same. 

It becomes a effective way to figure out who is actually a good person, if that person tends to be suspicious of someone who does good things for others, or tends to praise the acts.

Finally, everybody gets jealous or envious sometimes. It's how the person deals with it that speaks volumes. Sounds like you made the right decision in the end not bothering with someone who gets mad at you for such things."

You are being emotionally abused. Check out the website Love is Respect or the National Domestic Violence Hotline for signs of abuse. 
"Yeah, it can be pretty subtle. My mom always provided for me and never beat me or anything, but... I've never had an emotional attachment to her. And for the longest time I thought it was my fault, that there was something wrong with *me*. Because everyone else always says what a lovely woman she is, how kind and generous. But with me she was always hypercritical and nit-picking and never supportive, she was just concerned with how my behaviour and choices might reflect on her. And we never had an emotional attachment because the only time she ever showed me affection was when there was an audience, which confused the hell out of me, especially as a kid. I never knew what to expect from her emotionally. It was like she was a completely different person.

I distinctly remember a friend of mine hugging me once in high school and my first thought was ""oh my god, why are you holding me like that? what are you doing?"" That's not normal."
"The only priority here is your baby brother's welfare. Hitting a child so badly that it leaves a mark is a very serious crime. It's also an indicator of serious, harmful future behaviour. Report it to the police, and call an ambulance for your brother : he needs to be examined. He should NOT be sleeping if there is any possibility he could have a concussion!!!!!

Call your parents straightaway. You cannot deal with this. Your boyfriend, his sister and their parents will simply have to accept the consequences of her behaviour. Who the fuck hits a child? Don't protect her or her parents or your boyfriend. Let this play out as it needs to.

"While I understand where you're coming from and I've also read articles about the benefits of quality home time vs homework, I think it's highly unlikely that a school is going to change its homework policy because a mother called about it.  I don't think ""my ex husband wants to spend time with his kids the one night a week he sees them and it's putting stress on my daughter to have to make up the homework another night"" is going to be a very compelling argument.  Even if she did point the school to those studies, I don't think that is going to have much of an effect on OP's issue at hand."

Me, personally, I've lived paycheck to paycheck most of my life and $5000 is an unfathomable amount of money to spend on anything. I can't imagine even having $5000. As sad as it is to say, $5000 would change my life. I don't even want to tell you what kind of things I would do for $5000.  To hear you spent that on a cat certainly gives me weird, ugly, jealous feelings, but even then I still don't think you are in the wrong or crazy. I can absolutely understand why someone might feel that way, but I don't think it would be right for them to try to make you feel bad. 

Your cat is lucky to have someone who cares as much as you do, and you are unlucky to have friends and family who are callous enough to try and make you feel bad over spending money you have earned to protect a life. But so it goes, right?

You're definitely not crazy, and you're definitely not the first or last person to spend that kind of money on a cherished animal companion. Don't let anyone make you feel bad. "

"Honestly my mom's done this before. She calls me every night and when I don't answer she calls me every 30 mins until I do. It infuriates because it's making what I used enjoy, talking to my mom and confiding in her, into something I dread. From my experience your wife's unwillingness to let go will most likely push your daughter away and into a corner, she will be torn between feeling the need for space and the desire to make her beloved mother happy. I never managed to make my mom realize that I needed more space than she wanted to give, and while we still talk I never confide in her, never feel the desire to see her. It's more of a routine than actual genuine care. And I hate it. I truly believe that because my brother and father continuously gave into her demands because they just preferred that to an outright argument that she never considered that what she was doing was harming our relationship, and just believed me to be rebellious.

What I suggest is sitting her down to have a serious talk, let her know that this is not beneficial for their relationship. Acknowledge her desire to be close to her daughter, but emphasize the fact that your daughter is now an adult, she needs to experience life and make her own decisions. Reinforce that she has down a phenomenal job bringing up her daughter but that it is time to take a backseat and just be supportive when your daughter needs her to be."

Unfortunately, its hard to give this sort of advice right now because it's so unclear how things are going to turn out. For now, I'd follow the advice of other posters of telling your mum what happened and letting her deal with it, this definitely isn't something that you should be involved in solving. If your dad is coming back tomorrow, is there a friend that you can stay the evening/night with so that your mum can confront him without you there?
