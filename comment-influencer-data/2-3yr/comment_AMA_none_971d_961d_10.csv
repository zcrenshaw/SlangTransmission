"There's always going to be kids wanting a home, so never don't consider that approach."
Tax benefits! And a couple other legal things. That's really about it.
"My male friend (33) and I (29M) just bought a house together... we always joke we're in a heterosexual monogamous relationship (neither of us are gay). We aren't married and date women but it's just great to always have a close friend by your side!

I'm glad we're not alone and god speed!!! Sounds like a great setup! Good luck!!

Edit: we've known each other for 15 years."
"We share a bedroom, but separate beds. Sometimes we push them together though.

We are actually in the process of moving into our new place! Before we lived in some rough student-ish housing with a couple others. 

No intimacy of the romantic kind.

We've talked a lot about if we met a man etc. but we just keep ending up at the fact that we wouldn't really pick any man over each other. Or anyone. Also, she decided she really wanted to focus on other things now than finding a guy. I'm just not that interested in finding a guy (at least a long-term one). But we're definitely allowed to meet guys! 

We explain it a bit like single women who already have a child and a career - they have so much to focus on already, if an amazing man jumps in then great! But he's going to have to accept her child (i'm the child in this metaphor) and that's non negotiable. "
"Never with the same arrangement, but I've met MANY women (for some reason only women) who say they're envious and wish they either had a girl friend as close as we were or that they had considered it with their own best friend. 

SO was explaining to an old woman who used to work at our highschool that we were getting married. We were at a cafe sitting outside and a man overheard and started telling us it was the stupidest thing he's ever heard. Then a woman overheard and they engaged in some verbal war over our rights and such. We ended up sneaking away and we walked passed later and there was a whole group of people arguing over it! 

"
Why did you decide to get married instead of being those old spinster best friends?
Maybe the four of you should meet up... 
"Explaining it to people.

Also if by chance one of us find a guy we really REALLY like and then it would all just turn into a mess. "
"Goddamit, you're the assistant TO the regional manager!"
"We had a cute little ceremony with closest friends and family. Most of my family lives abroad though and her family is quite small so it just happened to be short and sweet! We did buy dresses though. We had been planning that since we were 11.

We went on a ""honeymoon"" that was basically like a vacation we took with our other 4 closest friends and we just had a girls' holiday of sorts :)

Thanks!"
"So not to discourage you because your situation sounds amazing. But there are plenty of children in foster care, you're not really stopping anyone who cant have kids from finding someone that needs their love. Im not against sperm donors and i encourage you to continue living your lives however makes you happy, but you sound like you'll be great parents and if adoption is something you might want to do i cant suggest it enough. There are plenty of horrible people who adopt, they could be lucky to have the two of you. Good luck either way!  :)"
"Is it fraud for a man and woman not in love to admit they got married for tax benefits? There's no law saying you need to be in love with your spouse as two citizens, just that you commit to eachother."
"What are your living arrangements? Do you sleep in the same bed? Has there ever been any intimacy between you? 

How would you feel if she met a man and decided to be with him? Are you allowed to 'meet' someone else? "
Big butt redhead milf anal POV
"&gt; We were looking into adoption but thought we wouldn't take away from the people who CAN'T have children, you know?

Lol.  The supply of kids in need of a home vastly outnumbers the demand.  The notorious difficulty of the adoption process has zip to do with scarcity."
"I'd say we're definitely closer than any old roommates just because of the time we've known each other. It's crazy to think we've known each other for longer than we haven't (if that makes sense). 

I think my parents were definitely initially hoping I'd have more of a conventional marriage but - especially my mother - saw how much she meant to me since we were kids and how I just wasn't into romantic relationships as much. Her parents were pretty much the same. Some of our distant family were a bit uncomfortable with the idea but in general we're both just so lucky to come from families who don't really give a shit. They just let people do their thing. "
Only on the cheek!
"We were looking into adoption but thought we wouldn't take away from the people who CAN'T have children, you know?

We might just go with sperm donor. My 'SO' has always wanted to (god knows why) be pregnant anyway. "
"For the last time, Seth, Game of Thrones is not real life! Damn."
That's bc the rest are dead. HIYOOOO! I'll see myself out
"Would definitely not be cheating. We're ok with each other hooking up/meeting guys. 

Honestly we've just decided to jump that hurdle if it comes, because we're 97% positive it won't. 

But I suppose a lot of it would depend on how old we were and said guy's situation as well."
Any downsides to deciding to marry instead of keeping your relationship at the friendship level? 
"""it's not right if her to take a woman when there's plenty of us out here who still need one""

""George, have you ever thought that it's men like you that make this arrangement so attractive?"""
"Honestly I just want to know what the wedding was like? Was it a simple court house get it done ceremony? Or friends and family?

Did you go on a ""honeymoon""? 

Neat idea! Glad it's worked out for you both so well! "
"Since we were only recently married, not really. I think we've fought maybe 4 times in our life and it was never serious. (Though, at 15 we thought giving someone else a ""more thoughtful"" birthday present was a HUGE deal)."
"YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND 
- every 28yo single misunderstood girl ever"
i dunno. Cuz its my birthday and I can do whatever the fuck I want?
and he'll only answer two questions. 
"Except we probably won't meet fantastic men we want to live with. She's tired of that scene and I was never really into romantic relationships at all. 

Legal benefits and other boring reasons."
You have come to the right place. 
"1. The now dead leader of the cult was a pedophile who sexually abused 100s of children enrolled in the educational institutions he established. The staff in these institutions are also accused of various abuses of this nature. 

2. It is based in India but it is global in scope. There centres in every major country around the globe. 

3. Their beliefs are relatively benign for the most part. It is largely Hindu mixed in with some new agey beliefs. The core of it is that they believe Sathya Sai Baba, a man who lived in India was God incarnate and created the universe. His teachings are agreeable to most people, his conduct in secret, was not. "
"""we don't see it happening"" -every 28yo single-girl ever"
Who would have thought that admitting sexual attraction in a marriage could ever cause a problem?
Sounds like the plot of a Seinfeld episode.
"So do you effectively live as roommates, but legally married?  Or would you say that your relationship is closer than roommates?

How did your families feel about this arrangement?"
Google?  Never heard of her...
"well... I guess you can consider yourself anything you want. 

Answer some questions you knob gobbler."
"Got drunk, smoked weed, and ate meat."
"We don't really care that much. We've had people tell us that we can't be considered straight either so we just decided ""fuck labels"" and let people think what they want after describing it the first time. If people think we're gay we're fine with it! "
Are you rickety cricket? 
"I'm sorry. I don't really have any questions but I'm really sorry. 

Edit: I have a question now. I just google liver donation and it says anyone can donate one without being a relative as long as you have the same blood type. Some require you have a relationship of some sort. What is your blood type? 
Also, the liver regenerates itself quickly. Yes there's pain for a week but none of your family has the same blood type?  

Don't give up. Plaster what you're looking for everywhere and anywhere you can. "
It will be the third question actually
"""Now that I'm off the hook, let me tell you how fucking ridiculous this all is.""

 - Obama, probably. "
HL3 Confirmed. I don't need to pull some hoodoo voodoo shit out of my ass to know this will be true. 
"&gt; The notorious difficulty of the adoption process has zip to do with scarcity.

This is really sad to think about"
"At first realizing the truth was a rush, it felt freeing and I had a weird pride about being able to figure out the truth. But that feeling went away quick. Not to be too dramatic but I've become someone I don't even recognize anymore. I don't trust anyone, I can't see much good
In the world anymore and I'm always angry. I think I'm likely going through depression but I'm not entirely sure. I feel as if this innocent part of me has died and I don't what to do to feel that again. "
Can you post a wedding picture?
What blood type are you? I'm sure many of us would be willing to donate.
"1. What are some of the horrific abuses?
2. Where is this cult?
3. What is it that they believe in?"

"Aaaw. Now I want to marry my bro. Not sure my girlfriend would approve, though."
Did you consult a lawyer? Couldn't your scheme be considered fraud?
"I know this doesn't count, but since nobody that does count has replied so far...I dated a suicide girl for a while. The whole ""other dudes see her naked"" thing wasn't bad. I got to sleep with someone whom many many other guys want to sleep with, and holy Fuck was she good at it. I wasn't entirely comfortable with it at the time, but if my current girlfriend wanted to get into full on hardcore porn, I'd support her. Can't help you with number 4. 



Edit: a word"
I'm the captain now.
"Hey gaben, why u wearing slippers on a 20 million dollar event"
Billions and billions served.  
What kind of bear is best?
Uhhh.... should you... be on reddit right now? 
Have you ever heard or met someone with the same arrangement? Have you ever had any strange reactions from people? Could you share some of the most memorable reactions?
"Depends on what you're into. For people who geek out about fine dining, the experience and memories might be priceless.  
  
The calculus of value is subjective."
He was nice but not as cheery as he is in the show.
So what happens then? Have you talked about it if one of you truly finds love with a guy? How would it get to that and would that be cheating?
"This question struck me as odd. How does anyone getting married trust they're current self with such a huge commitment? They planned their wedding for over a decade, I planned mine for less than a year. They probably have a more solid relationship than my husband and I, and we're pretty strong. "
"I myself do not start hating anyone who is Indian, just because they are from India. 
Most people on both sides of the border want nothing more than to live peacefully without the danger of a potential nuclear war above their heads at all time.

Its just that some influential people on both sides (that belong to either the government, the media, or are businessmen that profit in one way or the other from the small scale skirmishes) do not want the hate to diminish. Sometimes military leaders on both sides are too patriotic for their country's own good.
Either way, no regular citizen on either side of the border wants a war, or even bad relations.
They want trade, tourism and prosperity.

But that doesn't mean we are afraid to show some 'sibling-rivalry' on the sports grounds... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) "

So..did you kiss the bride/groom? :D
"Very much the opposite -- the kitchen is almost silent. Only the light clatter of pots and pans. Everyone knows what they're doing and orders are given by the expediter and chef in a quiet and controlled voice.

In fact, it's usually the first thing people comment when they tour the kitchen -- how quiet it is. Any restaurant at this level is typically the same.

Hardest part of maintaining a rating at a place like this is not getting too comfortable. Restaurants at the top start to drop their standards after a couple years at the top, in favor of seating more guests to make more money, and cutting other corners. That's when they start to lose stars and it can happen very quickly. So every year the Michelin-guide comes out we have a big sigh of relief and a big party in the restaurant to celebrate keeping our place."
"To put it simply, I do not like Trump. At all.

His words against the Muslims were more than just hurtful, and well, I was following the election campaigns pretty closely too. It didn't help matters when the Indians at the other side of the Pak-India border started cheering for him as soon as he won. Something just reeked of 'anti-muslim' propaganda. And I couldn't help hate him more.
But he has gone much 'softer' after winning the elections. I hope Trump doesn't go down in history as a 'bad choice' for president or something.

I know, not all westerners hate Muslims, and I really appreciate that.
It's just that the few people that do hate Muslims unconditionally are enough to create an 'Islam-hating' environment. 
Many western people that i have come across, either offline or online, just assume that a Muslim like me is a 'bad' person under the mind control of a cult like religion, when in fact I'm perfectly content with my beliefs and I follow them because I want to, not because I'm forced to do so by my parents, relatives or the society. 
What hurt me the most personally is when someone on Reddit (probably an internet troll) called me a terrorist... Just due to the fact I'm a Muslim. Maybe that's just how international media presents us nowadays.

As for you being an Atheist that doesn't insult all religions at every possible chance, I salute you.
I'm actually amazed people like you exist, as all atheists I've ever talked to seemed like condescending douchebags to me. Its glad to know that was just a coincidence, and good people actually exist.

People, especially atheists, ask me 'you're a Muslim, aren't you obliged to kill the 'nonbelievers' wherever you see them as it is said in the Koran? Isn't Islam just a barbaric religion?'
I always reply 'the Quran also clearly says 'to you, your way and to me, mine.' and this verse isn't subject to other conditions like the context of a past war or something.
Thus I don't discriminate due to religious reasons when talking to people, or making new friends.

I tried to express the opinion of a Pakistani Muslim here rather than that of a global citizen. Keep that in mind if my answers seem too self-centered.
Forgive me if my English is bad though.

"If she can't support your decisions, forget her, my man. Your new husband will."
"If a regular headache is like a papercut on your finger, CH are like amputating your arm at the elbow with no anesthesia.  Kind of like an ice pick stabbing you through the eye and temple and digging around in your skull for an hour or so.  This happens to me 5-6 times per day. "
"Explaining it over and over would be enough reason to avoid it for me.  Why set yourself up with a legal mess when you both will probably meet fantastic men that you will want to live with?

Seems more like a childhood pact that has somehow taken presidence over your adult decision making abilities. Lest I judge what I do not understand. Why not just be roommates?"
I hope someone will ask about Alien Swarm 2.
"I like the term ""heterosexual life partners"" :)"
"Not really, I mean, sure most of the people who dine at this place are easily in the top 1% of earners in the world, but there are also many people who dine here who make less than I do. They save up and it's their way of treating themselves or taking a little vacation. 

It's not totally unreasonable to drop that much on dinner for a special experience even if you're not a millionaire. I've eaten at almost all of the 3 star restaurants in the US and almost all have been worth the money in my opinion."
"This may seem personal, and if you don't feel like answering, just send a smiley face, but have there been any rough patches in the marriage?"
"I mean, as far as a bucket list goes. I'm done for this point in my life. I was able to make a career as a writer, I got to train and fight in MMA, I have a family, I got to work on a game with a major publisher, the only thing I won't be able to do is see attack on titan season 2

It didn't really take me long to accept it. I've always been of the mind set that our time is simply borrowed and when someone else needs it, it's time to go. It sucks but that's just how it is to me.

If I had a billion dollars I would most likely pay for my children's educations up to their doctoral degrees, place a lot of then money into stocks, CDs and high yield bonds for my kids, make sure my wife had enough money to live comfortably until it was her time and the rest would go to people who really need it.

As far as religion and an afterlife go, I don't have thoughts on it one way or the other. It's too abstract of a concept for me to grasp and because I was exposed to the reality of death at a young age, I never really thought beyond the immediate cons of the situation. Hope that answers your question"
What's the plan for having children?
I'd prefer to ask Google 
There's lots of interesting parallels you can draw between the tribalism of political parties and cults. But I would apply this to both democrats and republicans.
