"&gt;  I've spoken to people who've known him a lot longer and I've never heard of any red flags off them.

My father was the life of the party, big group of friends, people adored, never said anything bad about him.

he strangled my mother multiple times and home was hellish. Abusers aren't idiots and theyre not assholes 100% of the time.  "
"Yes. I don't want to ask her again, it was embarrassing enough the first time and its my mother, I hate talking to her about that stuff.  I barely know her boyfriend so I don't want to ask him.  Last time my sister made me do all the talking even though she pushed for us to talk to her about it."
"Ok, dude, this thread is not about you. "
"&gt;She stated that she has tried to kill herself twice before she met me, and she needs this to show I'm committed, because she will not be able to pull herself back to normal if we go any further and it ends.

She's emotionally blackmailing you. She's resorting to veiled threats to get her way. She demanded that you propose to her, and when you stood your ground,  she demanded that you buy her a ring. 

Also, the fact that she initiated sex after a huge emotional discussion is really alarming. She's testing you to see if she can still control you through sex since she can't control you emotionally with her demands.

There's nothing about her that sounds sane to me. 

Don't have sex with her anymore and don't cave into her demands. She's showing her true colors, and her true colors are that of an unstable and manipulative person."

"I'd definitely figure out your plan before breaking up with her. Her behavior is concerning enough that she may lash out or do something to endanger you, and you should have a safe place first."
I recommend being careful and not breaking someone else's iPad repeatedly then.
"I don't think you have the 'nice guy syndrom'. 

As you said your childhood was quite rough, with no one really being there for you emotionally. Your dad abused you physically and mentally, that leaves scars. It made you the kind of person who wants to avoid confrontation and fights. There is nothing wrong with that. 

When stating what traits you thought were fucked up, you mentioned the trait 'seeking for consensus when making decisions'. I think this is a very important trait to have when you are in a healthy relationship, with a normal person. It seems to me like your ex-wife didn't have this trait and disrespected you as a person. 

If you ask me she abused you mentally by making you think you were doing so much wrong and by saying your friends also thought you were screwing things up. She made abuse of your insecurity and kindness. 

You have been let down by a lot of 'key' people in your life. You want to please people and sometimes forget that your opinion is equally important. 

The traits you mentioned aren't fucked up. All you need to learn is how to stand up for yourself and that your opinion is important too. 

You deserve someone who respects you equally. You seem like a great guy, please don't try to change yourself. You aren't the one who has to change. That would make you a pleaser and a 'nice guy' again. You are important and so is your opinion. 

Try to stand up for yourself more, start small and you will see there are women out their who will give you the same amount of respect and love as you give them. 

Maybe try to look for some way to express your anger about what happened with your father AND your ex-wife. You need to accept and express those feelings, not only verbally, but also physically. You can go boxing, take up a self-defence class, ... 

I'm sorry for my English, it's not my native language. I hope I helped you out a bit. 

Good luck!

"My heart goes out to you, OP. It truly does. But a wedding is about a bride and GROOM. Not a bride and her father.

I do not recommend postponing the wedding given all that's been put in place. I know it's not an easy decision and may even feel a bit selfish, but it's not. This is your life. And your husband-to-be's.

I unfortunately do not have any solid advice on dealing with stroke victims but if you want to wait on his ""memory"" you may be waiting a very, very long time."

"Ohhh, maybe. But if you fess up that you knew he was a scary asshole the whole time and still allowed him unlimited access to the free bar and did nothing about his behaviour towards your guests, in her place, I'd think even less of you."
"So, you paid off his debts and bought him a new truck and now he's spending his time and money on golf and other people?  It feels like it would be unwise to close on a house in both your names and/or marry this guy if he can't be bothered to make a bit more time for you.

If you do marry him, seriously consider getting a good prenup.  He shouldn't profit off the passing of your family members.

You need to have a serious sit-down with him and ask if he thinks his actions are in line with his level of commitment to you.  You might also take another look at his finances.  If some of that $80k in debt was credit cards, there's a very good chance he's running up more debt (golfing fees, going out with friends).  Ask to see a couple months of bills and see if he's paying off the bill each month or running his debt back up.  The problem with paying off his debts in a lump sum is that it doesn't help him to change his spending patterns."

Has he STILL not contacted you? You're in the UK right? He hasn't heard from his pregnant fiance for a while day and isn't concerned? Wow.
"If I had to guess, I'd bet $5 that your brother's shots are so 'beautiful' because he shoots in RAW format and probably spends a *lot* of time in the background making manual adjustments to his pictures (kind of like a digital version old-school, time-consuming darkroom processing).

When you shoot pictures on a camera phone, the camera's AI make a bunch of 'best guess' adjustments to calibrate pictures, lighting levels, and to basically 'develop' the photo. It usually comes out looking pretty alright if you just trust the computer to guess for you... but those 'calibrations' are often the difference between a 'meh' photo and a 'Oh my god, how did you do this?"" one.

When you shoot on a nice camera set to use RAW format, you have to make all those corrections 'by hand' to each photo when you get home, but the end result is often *significantly* nicer.

Depending on how much I care about a picture, I can literally (but not typically) spend hours making adjustments to a single shot.

I *love* shooting, and doing digital photo development, and I do it constantly- but people only ever end up seeing a fraction of my 'best of' shots. With a lot of high-end cameras, you can't just directly transfer shots to other people (format is wrong and can't be read by 'normal' picture viewers), and they tend to look 'ugly' before they're properly developed.

Me personally, I don't like to release underdeveloped pictures I'm not happy with.

"If you don't want to eat the food then don't, but it's not your place to force her to eat or not eat something.  You crossed a line by controlling her eating habits and throwing it out.  Your intentions don't really matter because your actions were controlling and out of line.

If you think she is so gross and you can't handle that, your options are to break up with her or let it go.  It's never your place to force your beliefs like this on someone else."
"Just found this and wanted to chime in.

My boyfriend has a tough time allowing me to help him when he has decided he wants to do something for me. 

For example, if he decides he wants to make dinner for the both of us, since I mainly do the cooking because I am the stronger cook of the two of us, he will ask me to watch over him to make sure he's doing things properly. *But* if I tell him he's doing things improperly or help him when he's occupied doing something else, I'm reamed for not allowing him to do something for me.

The same happens in this scenario; he wants to do it for me, so I feel uncomfortable intervening because I don't know when/if he will get upset."
"It's flattering!  I love getting approached!  Some guys are threatened by confident and intelligent women, but would you really want to date those guys?  Play the helpless damsel for the rest of your days?"
"If he's eating most of the food, should it be split 50/50? And I like another commenter's suggestion of having different shelves for his food, your food, and food you share.

I guess I have trouble understanding the issue here. My husband eats much more than I do, so we make sure we buy enough of everything for both of us. If we run out of something one of us wants more of, we buy more."
"And you are just creating a situation where your children have a minimal relationship just like that.

"Oh god, please don't call her up and talk to her. I'm a sex worker and I would be *so pissed* if I got a call from an ex-client's girlfriend, even if we were still friendly. How would you feel if an ex-fuckbuddy's current girlfriend called you up and put you through a line of questioning that made it clear she thinks he's tainted by his interaction with you? Yeah. 

Look, the fact that he has her info and is friendly with her says that he was a decent, pleasant client. We don't do that for ex-clients generally. Seems unlikely she was trafficked or anything, either.  

Everyone is entitled to their dealbreakers. But this wouldn't be one for me. "
"Please do this, no contact would do him some good. When I was around 8 and visited my dad he'd play World of Warcraft for hours on end and never feed me or my sister. Mom wouldn't let him see us until the next year and he put the game down."

Sure I know what she meant but I still think it was a little insulting to my son. 
"Lack of respect by not telling you and then publicly berating you, but also a lack of respect for how important this is for you and your mom, and how much time and energy you've put into planning the trip.

"You really need more gay friends. If you spend your entire life thinking of yourself as the Only Gay in the Village, you get into this weird spiral where one minute you're depressed because you're so alone in a way no one around you understands and the next you're feeling oddly superior because you don't have those relationship dramas... which just goes back to reminding you how alone you are. It sucks; I've been there.

What you need to do is meet more queers. You need friends who get that only ~5% of the people you're into could ever return that and how fucking depressing it can be, and are willing to make jokes about straight people with you, and can maybe even introduce you to cute girls... If you're in a city, all you have to do is reach out. Go to roller derby and compliment the names, hit up a gay board gaming group, go hiking with dykes. We tend to congregate, and not just in bars anymore! (Though you should still hit up the bars if you want, that can be fun too.) On the other hand, if you're in a small town, the community might be a little quieter, and you might have to work a little harder. Meet up is normally pretty good, or maybe your friends have other queer friends?

You need to normalise gay for yourself, and finding a community is a big part of that. Straight people grow up surrounded by straight role models and a specific path that is popularly endorsed; queers need to work a little harder. Find gay friends, watch some happy gay movies (I recommend the Donald Strachey series, Pride, DEBs, Straight Jacket, and with a very tiny bit of imagination, Bend it LIke Beckham. Also every other lesbian seems to like Imagine Me and You, so I feel I should add that), hang out on autostraddle or r/actuallesbians, read trashy gay romances, watch youtube videos of Hannah Hart or that chick from Calling in Drunk or Sassibob. Stop focusing so much on finding someone to date under the assumption that it'll magically fix your life and make you okay with yourself, and try to be comfortable in your own skin first.

And remember that just because your friends have this one aspect of their life easier doesn't mean that it's perfect for them or that they have no problems. Right now, you're getting resentful in a Rick Springfield kind of way, where you see their public relationship and think that, if you only had that, everything would be perfect. It is easier for them in this one specific way, and it doesn't make you a jerk for wishing your life were like that too. It *does* make you a jerk if you get angry at them for something outside their control like that, and you need to take a step back and a breath."
"I was getting the same vibe, the combination of him placing the blame squarely on you (for swearing? for getting surprised?) and you expressing paranoia about being unable to understand what is upsetting him/what he expects you to do leads me to believe this is not just about you being ""mean"". 

When he says you are ""mean"", does he explain specifically what it is that you are doing that is mean or does he leave it vague/treat it like a character flaw ('when you swear it makes me feel like you are swearing at me and it comes off as hurtful/aggressive' vs. 'you're a shitty person for swearing' or just getting mad with no explanation)? If you were to look at the situations from his point of view, does it make sense that me might interpret something as mean (i.e. is he expecting something different from a situation and he interprets your actions as intentionally denying him what he wants, or does it seem like he is calling you mean for things that do not even impact him)? Did he think you were swearing at him, was he trying to cuddle you and took that as you rudely shutting him down, did he think you were berating him for a small mistake, or did he know that you were simply expressing surprise and then got mad at you for no apparent reason? When you try and talk about what has upset him, do you both communicate clearly or does one or both of you refuse to share your feelings, insult or attack the other, or otherwise prevent effective and honest communication (either intentionally or unintentionally)?

At best this sounds like a communication issue but depending on other factors it might be a manipulation issue as well. If you look at these situations and can understand why they might be upsetting from his perspective, it might be a communication issue. He might not be clearly conveying his understanding/expectation of what is happening, and then getting upset when you don't realize what he wants. Maybe he feels he is clearly communicating, and getting upset that you are ignoring what he wants. Maybe he feels like you are not communicating with him about your feelings, and takes the things you say as jabs at him and he wants you to be more open/clear/kind. There is a possibility that he is interpreting frustration on his end about a situation as you being mean because you cause that frustration, instead of recognizing that you don't understand why he is frustrated because of communication issues on one or both ends. It is tough to know without having a calm and honest conversation with him where it does not turn into a fight. 

But if you find that there is no rhyme or reason to the things he calls mean, or that he refuses to talk with you about his feelings, or if he refuses to work with you on this and places the blame solely on you, or if he exhibits other signs of trying to keep you upset and confused (belittling your feelings, lying to you, refusing to communicate, etc) it might be that he is trying to manipulate you. He might not even recognize it as such, he might feel that this is how you get someone to change a behavior you don't like (manipulate them instead of communicating with them). But if he is making it impossible for you to address the situation in any other way beside automatically deferring to him and constantly working to please him, and there is no communication besides him telling you what to do with no compromise, it sounds like he might be trying to control you instead of trying to work with you.

Either way, I would recommend talking to your therapist about your concerns, and asking your husband to maybe join you for a session depending on how the talk with your therapist goes. Tell your husband you want to work on this issue but you feel like you are having trouble effectively communicating, and you think it would be helpful to have someone there to assist you both in sharing your thoughts clearly and developing communication strategies that will address the issue. Honestly, either situation sounds possible--be open to realizing that your communication style is making your husband feel like you are attacking him and that you both need to come up with strategies that allow you each to share and be heard, but also be cautious that this might be a manipulation tactic and he might be less than willing to sort this out with you.

"This right here, she is sorry you are not on your knees asking for forgiveness. "
"Seriously! I had to ask my husband (then fiance) exactly ONCE to not smash cake in my face. He said OK, and that was it. No cake-smashing. If your fiance can't be bothered to understand your side of this (on one of the most important days of your life together), that speaks volumes on how much (or little) he respects you."
"Choking correlates with an abuser eventually killing their spouse. Many women are slapped and pushed, but the ones choked and strangled are the most likely to end up dead.

"I have thought about this too, that he might prefer working to being a father, as crappy as it sounds.

His paternity leave ends in five months, so I still have to find a way for me and my child to survive this. We can't afford a nanny, my mom is physically disabled and his family is out of the question.

I might have to cut back on my work and look about a loan on a postpartum helper or a doula of sorts."
"Stop hiding the truth and just tell her you do resent her and thought was best to keep quiet, once bitten twice shy...."
"I was fully prepared to take your side when I saw the $175K figure, but the more I read the more I feel you're being inflexible.

I agree that blowing $15K on a wedding is excessive, especially when you have a mountain of debt. But your ""compromise"" of a courthouse wedding wasn't really a compromise at all: It was you getting what you wanted, and her getting nothing she wanted with the consolation prize of ""Look at all the stuff we'll be able to buy one day!"" 

And with no guests? Am I understanding that correctly? Because your comment about meeting your parents some other time makes it sound like you two will be the only people attending this courthouse wedding. I can see why she'd be incredibly upset about that. 

You were just given $30K for free, and your fiancée at least has more in savings. Where's the harm in dropping a couple thousand so you can have your family and friends present when you tie the knot? It would obviously mean a lot to her, or she wouldn't keep bringing it up. "
"First, I am sorry that you are going through so much right now.

Second, I know it would be a terribly difficult decision to make, but if you truly can't handle it, you can decline to take the boys in.  They will go into the foster system and may find somewhere wonderful to land before they're 18.  Or is there maybe an aunt/uncle who can help?  Anyone at all to help shoulder the burden with you?  Any families at their school you can carpool with?

Lastly, I really hate to be a party-pooper, but I would very strongly caution you and your husband against starting your own family if the two of you have trouble managing 3 days with teenagers.  Teenagers are in some ways easier, some ways harder, then babies/toddlers, but teenagers actually sleep and let you sleep.  If your husband is having anxiety attacks and staying up all night crying right now, imagine him with a newborn and extreme sleep deprivation..."
Right. Writing is on the wall. Cut your losses. 
"if he requires one of you to go by a codename for the wedding to evade the attention of the alliteration gods why is it you, and not him. he's the one with the problem."
"Lawyer currently did not think that a stock statement or preemptive statement would be fruitful. This is currently on the verge of blowing up further, any preemption unfortunately will just draw more attention to it. If said scandal increases in volume then we post the statement we created. No video recordings however, written statement only. "
"Yeah, I would add that after 3 years and he doesn't want to take it to the next level at his age probably means he doesn't want to live with you or see any long term potential with you. My SO had asked me to move into his home that he had lived with his ex-girlfriend and had no qualms about it. 


It was smarter because it was cheaper for both of us and more efficient. Your boyfriend not putting a time frame on anything especially after 3 years, even a loose time frame is a pretty big red flag. You can't speed anything up because if after 3 years if he doesn't want to live with OP, he's not going to want to in the next 3 years. "
I'm not sure if a nanny in the UK is that good of a solution. I mean with a nanny in Canada the kid would at least have loving grandparents around. I don't think having the kid around would make the daughter a better mother.
Yeah after the first few times I made a point of remembering her license plate. It's always her. And she's always *in* the car so I physically see her there.
"You did nothing wrong. It appears that your 'best friend's' wife is a little insecure about your friendship with her husband. They shouldn't have been opening drawers or cupboards in your house.

All you can do is state that it never occurred to you to rearrange your 'dressing room' for their visit. I remember when I first bought a house I had very little furniture, and one room contained only my dresser. I would explain it this way.

In theory, no one should have opened a drawer in someone else's home, although people do snoop IRL."

"So, basically, your parents set up a system of rewards all throughout your childhood that (whether intentionally or not) were stacked against Kim because of her particular limitations, so she spent her entire young life feeling like she was an outsider and a disappointment in her own family.

So she decided that since none of you (including your parents) were going to take an actual interest in her success, she would do so herself.  She's done so, and is doing well in spite of her childhood.

Now, the mother that made her feel like she was never worthwhile is coming back to her because she needs something from Kim, and Kim is not willing to give from the success she built for herself in order to support the woman who never supported her?

Does that about sum it up?

I'm with Kim.  She owes your parents, and you, nothing."
"Yup! I was a wedding where this happened. She had one ""dad"" on each arm. They high fived at the alter. Cute as shit. "
"Call me crazy, but it sounds like he's trying to trap you in a relationship with him.


As far as abortion vs. keeping it goes - this should 100% be your decision. it is your life and your body - pregnancy, giving birth, and raising a child are not easy, and there are numerous possible complications. You should not be keeping it because someone else wants you to. Do what is best for you."
"Yeah, it's okay to not like your haircut but he can keep that to himself after hearing that you really like it yourself. If it makes you happy, he should respect that and realize that it's *your* body and choices. 

If he brings it up again or tries to show you more compiled lists of nonsense, I'd reconsider the relationship because you've already expressed how you feel about your haircut and was upset by his. "
"It's perfectly ok to be upset over accidentally killing the snail you. It's also ok for him to try and lighten the mood by making a joke to make you feel better, even if it didn't.


It is NOT ok for him to smash a bunch of snails in front of you after you were clearly bothered (not totally distressed but obviously not happy) by accidentally killing one. He disrespected you and your feelings, on your birthday no less. He was the immature one who disrespected you and your feelings. Let people know it's not about the snails, it's the fact that he did something he knew you were uncomfortable with right in front of you on your birthday and was an asshole about it. You didn't break up with him over snails, you broke up with him because he was an asshole who disrespected you."

I had a high school boyfriend do it too. Luckily for me I had gotten on the pill and didn't tell him. I found out when he told me he didn't understand how I wasn't pregnant since he'd been poking holes in all the condoms. Broke up with him on the spot. There are crazy people out there.

This girl is acting incredibly weird."
"Things aren't magically going to switch to normal though. 7-9 months down the road, your son is going to be used to getting preferred treatment from you and your daughter will barely have bonded with you or her brother. How are you going to suddenly just switch gears then? You've even stated spending equal amounts of time with your daughter is ""undesirable"". Is it suddenly going to become desirable or are you always going to (maybe secretly) harbor preference for your son because of your little ""us against them"" phase?

If you want normal you gotta start acting like it now. Both you and your wife are digging your family into a hole that's gonna be tough to get out of months down the road."

"You need to find a copy of your school's plagiarism policy and reread it.  They can interpret plagiarism however they want and you're supposed to abide by it.  If they define plagiarism as ""sharing work"" whatsoever (even though your intent was clearly to give her examples of directions in which she could take her project) then you may not be able to get out of this.

Edit: Also, find out exactly according to the policy what the consequences are. What's the worst case scenario? Are you facing needing to go to summer school?  etc.  I'm assuming you're supposed to go to college so if you're unable to graduate then what's your next option?  You need to be prepared.  Also talk to the teacher - he knows you and it sounds like he would likely vouch for you.  "
"There was another post here a while back very similar to yours; these situations don't end well.

The sister joining your honeymoon is a symptom of the problem. That your fiance's parents are supporting it is beyond frightening.

You aren't even married yet and you're already being cast aside for what the brother and sister want. This is bad. Really really bad. The red flags are visible from space.

Definitely put a halt to the wedding. Counseling probably won't help this situation, but you could give it a try. Otherwise, just walk away; there's a man out there who won't treat you like you're second to his sister."
"&gt;He pushes her off as he said her face disgusted him but than she starts giving him head and he lets her.

Breaking up is not a negotiation.  She doesn't have to accept it.  You just have to not interact with her any more once you've set your mind to it.
"I wonder if you're just not expressing yourself clearly to them. Nobody in their right mind should expect you, a grown woman, to start treating your father's new wife as ""a mother figure."" Thats crazy. Just because they signed a contract together, doesn't mean you two magically have a relationship out of nowhere. I guess she's technically a grandma now, but...not really, she missed out on your entire childhood. I don't think you have to tell her, or anyone else, explicitly that you don't want that type of relationship. Just show her through actions what your boundaries are, and what your expectations are. If she is pushing too much, just stick to your guns and don't give in to things like her throwing a shower, etc."

"How well do you get on with your SIL?  I think she really needs to be included in this conversation from the very start, considering it is her future child(ren) that you are trying to protect.  I'm concerned that perhaps your brother may not believe you and that is as far as the information will go.  I would tell both your brother and your SIL at the same time.  The benefits being that your SIL can be more critical in her thinking and more likely to believe you.  She may have already gotten ""vibes"" from her FIL.  Also, she will probably recall in more details what you have told them, as your brother may go into a fog and stop listening (a bit like getting bad news at the doctors if you get what I mean).

And yes....  You should be with someone who doesn't turn into a complete nasty, abusive mess when the going gets tough.  "
"You are more important than his sexual desires. Holy fuck he has no respect for you. I wish I was there to yell at him for you. When someone loves you they don't pressure you to do things you don't want to do. You already went through that once in your life and know it's something you never want to experience again. Your grown now but that does not mean he has the right to try to persuade you to do anything you dont want to do just because your in a secure environment. 
Love you more than you love him right now, it's very important."
"&gt; What Alfred is doing right now is a form of emotional abuse. This might be hard to understand, but by not speaking to you, not coming home when expected, not answering texts, etc, he is trying to control you emotionally. It's a power play. 

&gt; His expectation is that when he eventually comes home, you will be waiting for him, terribly upset, and willing to do ANYTHING to make him happy, including apologize as if YOU had done something wrong,

I wish I knew this years ago. I'm glad you pointed out how controlling stonewalling is, and that days later is not ""cooling off"", it's manipulation."
I guess take solace in the fact that you may have done it in a shitty way but at least you gave him an excuse to leave a relationship where it sounds like he was made to feel miserable and unwanted for almost a decade.

"THIS.  Right here, OP.  This is the only reason he proposed.

Is that the life you want?"
"I knew a guy who went to prison for that. He really thought he was helping himself when he told the cops that he always made sure she did her homework before they had sex. Sometimes I think about that and feel so sad for how fucking dumb he is. That man was the kind of dumb you couldn't even get mad at, it's so obviously debilitating."
"Wow, that guy is a first class PoS. Enjoy your trip and being freed from this relationship!"
Dude I was a teenage girl in Los Angeles and it was fine but you know what Hamilton tickets can't cure? Having huge liars for parents. Poor thing.
"He's freaking out from the stress of Grad school and having a pregnant girlfriend.    

Joining the Marines is possibly the worst thing he could do at 29, but I doubt they would take him anyway.  He may have regret from when he was 22, but that ship has sailed and he needs to come to grips with that. 

He really needs to be seeing a therapist, you can't tip toe around this problem."
Your relationship is with your fiancee and not his parents so you need to tell him.
It's pretty immature that the first way you thought of phrasing it to your coworker is to blame your girlfriend.
That's the feeling I'm getting here ...not insecurity but rather fetish. She might be turned on by the thought of you with other women and is trying to engage you in her fantasy.

"Honestly, sorry to say this and i dont want to come off as harsh, but I think OP was being selfish throughout this whole ordeal and she was worried about herself over the feelings and good intentions of her fiancé. It seems like OP expects things a certain way and then when it doesn't go a certain way, emotions arise and she tries to ""correct"" it. Not to mention very little trust involved"
"From Claire's reaction, it sounds like she was supposed to hide Vera's existence from you. Your GF literally hid her daughter from you intentionally for the entirety of your relationship. This goes far beyond ""red flag"" territory into ""break up ASAP because this person is crazy"" territory."
"Seriously, what is he thinking? Plus he's already proven he'll put his sisters needs above his own future wife's. Not cool, would definitely have me rethinking the marriage. Don't get engaged after six months, kids. "
I hate to say it but once she dumps the kid on your she will almost never come back.  The shame of abandoning her child will keep her away and raising them will be all up to you.  Sure she will send you money but she will never ever be a mother to that child.  She is using you to cover for her shitty behavior and now you will have to pay the cost of her sleeping around and not using protection.  She is running away and will never come back.  At best she will come back when all the hard work is done so she can enjoy the rewarding parts.
"Keep riding that Noptopus, OP."
"Aww, shucks, thank you. But it's more about how I refuse to be my family's doormat. I went NC with my mom's family before and I have strict rules set about what is and is not ok, and if they disrespect them, and by extension me, then they know it's back to NC - except it'll be for good."

"Then it's abuse. Doing it during sex doesn't make it any less abusive, unless you specifically ask for it. 

My partner chokes me in bed. However, here are the differences - I asked him to because I wanted to try it and we were together long term so I knew I could trust him. He knew I desired it, I made it clear. If I ever ask him to stop, he stops. We use a safe word. For situations (like choking) where I can't speak, we use a safe code. I lightly slap him (whatever is the nearest body part) once if I'm reaching my limit, three times if he needs to immediately stop. I've done the three slaps several times. I don't even have to do the third slap, he stops immediately at 2. 


What he's doing is abuse. 

You mention in another post that you'd be homeless if you were to leave. Can you find a women's shelter you can speak to? They help with more than just removing you, they can then help with housing, a support network, hooking you up with financial assistance, advocacy in court (not that you'd necessarily go to court over him, that's obviously your own choice). they do a lot to help women in your situation. 


don't live like this. this isn't love and these aren't pranks."
Tell her you're so happy to hear from her and you regret the intervening years of no contact caused by her parents' estrangement and your brother's poor decisions. Address her fears of your family's animosity with reassurances that grandparents and cousins would love to know what's going on -- and you'd love to put them in touch *with her permission*. 
"Narcissists behave like this because they want to look good without putting in the effort. They see other people as means to an end, like puppets they can mastermind to fit into their schemes, all so they can maintain the grandiose and amazing appearance they have of themselves.

Speaking as the child of a toxic, narcissistic mother, she would smile and brag about my achievements in public so it would make her look good, but scream and berate me for hours because I was worthless and stupid. Other people in the narcissist's circle must make him/her look good at all times or receive lashings, verbally or otherwise. A peek into the warped minds of narcissists."
"You don't have to label yourself, but if a label will help you answer questions about yourself, maybe look up the term *demisexual*? It's still part of the asexuality spectrum. We can't post external links here, so I'll just copy and paste the first search result (from the AVENwiki):

&gt; A demisexual is a person who does not experience sexual attraction unless they form a strong emotional connection with someone. It's more commonly seen in but by no means confined to romantic relationships. The term demisexual comes from the orientation being ""halfway between"" sexual and asexual. Nevertheless, this term does not mean that demisexuals have an incomplete or half-sexuality, nor does it mean that sexual attraction without emotional connection is required for a complete sexuality. In general, demisexuals are not sexually attracted to anyone of any gender; however, when a demisexual is emotionally connected to someone else (whether the feelings are romantic love or deep friendship), the demisexual experiences sexual attraction and desire, but only towards the specific partner or partners.

"Are you saying that this time your daughter pulled a kitten's whiskers out by the roots? Because how else would there be blood spots? Scissors don't leave blood spots.

That is incredibly cruel and malicious, and I am with your girlfriend here. Not only did your daughter know better, but it sounds like she escalated her abuse of a helpless pet to a higher level (and she did it to an even younger, more helpless animal than the first time).

It sounds like you are trying to get your child the help she needs. I'm afraid that this might be the end of your relationship, at least for a while. Your girlfriend is not wrong in recognizing that a child intentionally causing pain to an animal is a bad sign, and she may not want to sign up for that, especially when she's an animal lover and activist. "
"&gt;They said things like ""family should take care of each other""

Pft hypocrites. So did they only decide this when it became convenient for them?

I would stay in (low) contact however I would make it clear that they won't be getting any financial help, since it feels like the reason they are willing to mend fences is because they only want to use you for money. If you give them anything, it would have to be a loan (signed contract included) and not to exceed $500 until the previous loan is paid off with interest. This is what they did to you, essentially.

My suspicion is that they also kept you out of the funeral because they were afraid you might try to claim something from your father's will (if he had one) and any further interactions around his death would increase the chances/likelihood of you inquiring about his will and seeking a share of the pie. I know it sounds dumb but greedy people do think this way when it comes to end-of-life and inheritances - a ""don't let them feel any more invested in the deceased or they'll ask about inheritances"" thing."
"He's less interested in the ""honest"" part of ""brutally honest"", it sounds like. I think Ryan just likes being brutal."

"Okay. I have a question about the police suggestion, for anyone who knows how to answer it.

To be completely honest, I had a really upsetting experience with the police after I was raped. Not only were they unhelpful and acted bored and disinterested in my case, but going to the cops actually ended up making my situation worse; I filed reports but never got to press any charges, and the cops talked to my rapist (because he was bothering me and I was scared of him), and he actually ended up becoming more scary and threatening because of this.

I do want to have something on file in case this happens in the future, but I'm wondering if there's any way I can talk to the police and still guarantee I don't have to press charges or communicate with him anymore, and that he won't know what I've done (because what if it sends him off the deep end?). I know that might sound like the coward's way out, and maybe it is, but I'm honestly just SO done with him and I think it would fuck up my life to continue engaging with him after this in any way."

"Hey. Just wanted to let you know that I was sort of in your niece's position before, except I was 5, not 10. I knew maybe 5 words of english before being thrust into another culture. My parents did not die but had left me to be brought up by others before they finally took me when I was 5 so for all intents and purposes they were like strangers to me. 

I've lived in Hong Kong for awhile.My advice is to hire a maid in HK, there are female maids who can drive although they are rare. You can also get a husband-wife maid couple, husband drives, wife cares for your niece, cooks etc. The maid will also know better than you what a 10 year old needs. There are some with professional childcare/nursing qualifications. Get her a furry companion, and a therapist and hobbies where she will find friends (ballet? music? tennis?) and send her to the international school like previously suggested.

I am so sorry for her, and the situation you are now both in."
I really don't understand how he can see texts from OP's mom freaking out with excitement about going to see this show and immediately think that the tickets are up for grabs. What a narcissistic asshole. 
"&gt; Right now I'm feeling like I've made a huge mistake marrying him.

You really did, though you didn't get to see how ugly he is until afterwards.

I wouldn't bother with counseling. _Definitely_ don't consider forcing a child to have this guy as a father. "
"I don't even understand how people think the way he does. I'll shot talk her so everyone gets that she's terrible and that's why we broke up. But i wanna get her back too. So IF things go as planned, they're back together and everyone hates her now so they don't wanna be around us and they see I'm with someone I tried very hard to make look immature. "
I would do it secretly with no one knowing - not even your boss. I mean.. what if it IS your boss? 
"If by losing everything you mean some money (which you can make more of) and a shitty cheating wife ( which you can find a better one) then yeah, stay with her."
"I don't think there is anything wrong with a woman having a say in her engagement ring. She is the one who will wear it for many, many years to come, after all. I think it generally makes the most sense for a couple to decide to get married without having the ring in hand, and for them to pick it out together. That is not exactly the most ""romantic"" way to go about it, though. 

A few issues stand out at me - one is that if she is going to SPECIFY what ring she wants, the idea that you ""know her well"" doesn't really hold water. She could tell a complete stranger what she wants. Two is that if you're going to share a life together, you must be able to talk finances and other sensitive topics like this. 

If you aren't going to be proposing any time soon, I think you should put this out of your head for now. When you feel it is getting closer, perhaps ask her if she wants to re-visit any ring styles to find / confirm her favorite. But be honest with her on your budget. This is really a cost you share (or should be, in my opinion) so you should be in agreement with what amount of money is going towards this item. It is not fair of her to demand that you spend an amount you are not comfortable spending. "
"Yea -implying a woman is ""slutty"" for wanting to enjoy sex is not congruent with being a cool guy, personally, I feel quite the opposite."
"The age of consent here in the UK is 16, so technically he wasn't breaking any laws or anything. But I agree, it was kind of weird, especially since he could have gotten any woman his own age."
She should speak with the police and get a restraining order. She should try not to be walking alone in places where they will know to find her. The type of behavior they're displaying indicates they will not just let it go.
"&gt;she's genuinely nice and caring, something I've never really had in a relationship before.

You've never had it in a relationship because you are EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD, and if you stay with her you never will.

Also, someone who snoops your bank account and demands you buy her more shit is not ""genuinely nice and caring""."

"I second the idea of asking for her e-mail address, making a burner account and sending her your story.

"If my kid told me  "" You can ground me all you want, but you can't stop me from doing what I want at school"", I'd just give them a smile and say, ""You know what? You're absolutely right. I can't stop you from doing what you want at school. What I do have is absolute control over what you can and can't do at home, which I can tightly restrict, let me assure you. Make your stepbrother's life difficult, and not only will you be limited to two main locations you are allowed to go to (school and home), but you can say goodbye to television, internet (unless supervised for school work), (and whatever luxuries you allow him). Let's see if your actions towards your stepbrother are worth the risk."" He seems to think he holds the power in this situation, he also sounds like he's never known what it feels like to be grounded. I mean seriously grounded. I would also agree with others on this thread, he needs therapy for sure. "
"I don't know, it's weird, like he's not anxious about spending on some stuff, like doing stuff with his friends or his hobbies, but he gets really tight when it comes to stuff for the family. It really upsets me, it feels like that's backward from how it should be.

In some ways I get the impression it's almost a competitive thing for him? Like one of his friends bought a house in cash and my husband seemed really envious that he was able to do that. It's like he gets aggressive about saving out of competitiveness with his friends instead of a need for security. That might be too hard on him though, that's me reading between the lines and not something he has come out and said."
"Unfortunately people get in these situations by being surrounded by assholes and not knowing anything else. That's also why a lot of those people end up here, they don't have people in their lives they feel comfortable talking to about stuff like this. 

Honestly my heart breaks a little every time I see a person posting on here who doesn't mind or sometimes doesn't even recognise they're being (badly) abused. Sometimes they get a lot of shit for it in the comments but you have to imagine what their lives are like that they're being treated like that and are willingly or blindly accepting it. These people haven't known any other kind of relationships (or don't have enough respect for themselves/enough self esteem ~~anymore~~), so they don't run once things start going bad. 

Most people commenting here wouldn't ever accept this kind of behaviour because we've seen enough healthy relationships in our lives and around us that we know it's not okay. "

"""No.  I cannot afford this, and I do not appreciate you harassing me when you know nothing about what I am going through right now.  I am not discussing this with you or anyone else any more.""

Then cut off any further conversation unless and until she apologizes, and tell any relatives who are joining her in her campaign that they can pay for Mom's trip themselves if they want to make this happen; the last thing you need right now is loans hanging over your head on top of everything else.  Then cut them off if they won't leave you alone, too.

"Honestly, since his fetish seems to be very young women, to the point of questionably legal,  this may all be coming up now because you aren't a young girl any more.  You're a grown woman with two kids.

Disgusting as it is, you've aged out of his range.  He's probably dumping this all on you now because he knows you'll object and leave him so he can move on to grooming a new 21 year old without feeling guilty about what he's done to you.

Don't blame yourself for any of this.  He wasn't upfront about his fetish so he never gave you the opportunity to say ""I don't think so"" before you got involved with him."

Don't just sweep it under the rug or put off talking about it or you will just become bitter and resentful. "

Make her pay and make her pay ASAP. I rent out rooms in my house and have had this happen to me. Call the house meeting and nip this in the bud. It will let them know this isn't cool and will make her think about alternative housing options. If she can live there totally free as long as she wants she has no reason to try and leave and the longer this goes on the harder it will be to get to where you were people and comfort wise.

Just stop inviting him. Don't answer the phone, don't give an explanation - he doesn't deserve one. Stop talking to him at events where you are forced to be with him. Just avoid him. Walk away. Tell him you're not posing anymore. Just stop.

"Holy shit. I pray and hope the other two kids are also safe and sound, and that you all can work through this trauma with the help of the psychologist. "

"To be fair, she has a point. If she quit now, stayed home with you and things ended between you, she could very well find herself in a bad financial situation. If I were in her shoes, I would definitely remain working or studying.

However, her taking her resentment about her job out on you is not okay.

Have a sit-down conversation with her about how her attitude is hurting your relationship. Ask her what her problem really is - you seeming to live on easy street? Are you becoming boring because you don't go out and do anything? Worry about money?

As an aside - are you sure the money is going to last you forever? Maybe hit up the personal finance or financial independence subreddits, because your expenses may change as you get older and your sum may not be enough."
"Yes, stand up for yourself and end it.  You two are just not right for each other, because (at the very least) you have vastly different communication needs.  Why would you put up with someone who again and again treats you ways you don't want to be treated?"
"There is no compromise between having 1 kid and having 2 kids, so ultimately one of you is going to have to cave to the others' demands.

There are tons of ways you could try and decide what's best. From an financial standpoint, one is best. From a companionship standpoint, two is best.

Ultimately, though, it sounds like you always knew your wife wanted two children. The way you describe the way you ""decided"" on only having one, it sounds like a unilateral statement from you and not a jointly agreed-upon decision. So it sounds like you always knew what she wanted. If you didn't want that, too, you had the option of walking away and letting her find someone who shared her desire for multiple kids. Instead, you stuck around and started a family with her. Based on that, I think you kind of owe it to her to finish what you started.

Of course, if you'll be interminably miserable with two children then don't go ahead with having a second. But I think that would constitute a 'bait and switch' on your part, and I don't think she would be wrong to hold that against you for a long time, which, if two children is something she really truly feels like she needs, she probably will."
"&gt;  He's going to get pushier, especially since he probably instantly saw his bullshit working on your husband, and he knows he'll be less likely to protect you.

This, OP. You are a game, to him, and now he thinks he has the upper-hand because your husband is angry with you. Please take the necessary measures to protect yourself - I'm scared FOR you. 

And I really hope your husband snaps out of it, soon. I'm really sad that he immediately jumped to you ""leading him on"" instead of acknowledging that Dave is creepy to a criminal degree (even after you mentioning it to him all along). 

Good luck, OP. "
"Move to a place without grandparent rights and never contact his family again. Otherwise since they sound powerful and rich they can wind up with 50-50 custody or even try for full custody. Tell everyone you don't know who the dad is, put no one on the courthouse certificate and deny deny deny that you know who the father is if you apply for benefits. Delete your social media for life and don't put any pictures of the kid online."
"&gt; She thinks that our daughter's career is way more important and that *I should be looking forward to raising our first grandchild together.*

It sounds to me like OP's wife wants to raise the baby. I am currently pregnant with my mother's first grandchild. She lives in the same city as me and is probably more excited then I am (and I very much want my child). She offers to do things like take a few weeks off work to be around to help, to hold the baby while I sleep, ect. She canceled a planned trip to Europe when she found out I was pregnant to save all her vacation time even though I told her my husband will be taking a paternity leave. She figures then she'll have it if I need or want any help with the baby when he goes back to work. Also offers to babysit. She is highly educated and successful in her career not sitting around at home. However, this baby is the first thing that's making her wish she was already retired so she could nanny it while I went to work (I pointed out that would be silly as she makes much more then I do). Some new grandmothers really want to be around their grandbaby and would see it as more of an opportunity then a burden. 

I agree OP's daughter is being pretty irresponsible here. Remember though **she wanted an abortion as soon as she found out she was pregnant** and couldn't get one. **I think the core issue here is that she doesn't want a child** (or at least not at this point in her life). Being a single mom to an unwanted infant is not necessarily good for the mother or infant emotionally. Babies are a ton of stress and work that not everyone finds equally rewarding. They also need a lot of love and care to form secure attachments. 

**Edit:** OP very well may not want to raise his first grandchild. I just think we can't assume OP's wife doesn't when she thinks he should be looking forward to it (implying she is). "
"What does your brother want? Would he like to see them?

 I'm half Persian, I know you're not exagerating when you say your parents would rather not know. They probably would feel very very guilty. But, if your brother tries to relieve that pain, by forgiving them, explaining he thought they were dead, understands their predicament. It might be worth telling them so they can have a relationship."
Dave is not going to tell her... this was not some one time mistake. He purposely brought another woman on a trip because his GF couldn't come knowing they were into each other.
"Your instincts here are likely correct, it sounds like your dad is trying to play favorites with your children the same way he did with you. You know how badly that messed up your sibling relationship, why should you let that happen to your children as well? 

If your dad cannot respect your parenting, then he should not have significant exposure to your children. "
"&gt; My fiancé is witty, sarcastic, and can come off as abrasive to someone if they don't know her personality or her family. 

Mm-hmm.  And how many people never bother to take the time to do that because they're so turned off by the abrasiveness?  Or take a look at the context and still go, ""Nope, that is not something I want to deal with on a regular basis""?

Has your sister-in-law overreacted?  Sure.  Does she have her own flaws she could stand to fix?  Totally.  But she's not the only one who needs to be adaptable here.  It shouldn't take that much effort on your fiancee's part to treat her like some kind of humorless business associate and keep the conversation polite and neutral when they do have to interact.  You need to be willing to accept that ""if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all"" is a perfectly valid way for people who find your fiancee's attitude less charming than you do to handle the situation.  And both of you need to realize that inviting your brother and not her means that not only is your brother probably not coming to the wedding, that relationship may be toast unless you admit everyone's gotten way too defensive and take a step back."
"Size 16, fat and rock a bikini. Go for it. It's hot and I wanna be comfortable. I don't care that I'm fat and I don't care if you think I'm too fat for a bikini, I'm not wearing the bikini for you. It's my body. It's her body. Tell her to wear it. Hell, bring her to buy another bikini! "
"Firstly, 150 odd people? That is not a small wedding. And you don't complain about not getting gifts to people you haven't invited to the wedding, or to celebrating-the-marriage things! 

Honestly, it sounds a bit like your friends have got in the habit of expecting you to take care of them-- to treat them. At this point, I think it's perfectly okay to call them out on it. 

If you want to make nice, you can say, ""I'm not goingto have time to spend with anyone at the wedding-- I wouldn't have any time to talk to you, or pretty much anyone, but I'd like to go for a meal with you after, like I did with yours.""

"
"&gt;I named the (small) spider who lives on our kitchen's ceiling Hector, so I was probably saying his name.

Can I just say how adorable this is OP? Your husband is being a jerk."
"Keep up with the therapy. I just read your OP and this stuck out to me:

&gt;Ben was amazing and I couldn't believe that he wanted to date me.

I struggle so much with self-esteem issues, and I see the same traits in your posts. It's going to take a lot of time and effort to look inward, find out where these issues started, and learn how to deal with them. I would recommend decreasing contact with Mary, because the stress of that shame is not helping you grow. When you've healed some more, you'll be strong enough to reach out to her and have an honest conversation.

There's hope for your friendship yet, but you not until you learn to take care of yourself."
"&gt;I'll never get to see my dog again at this point

It's not your dog anymore. You gave the dog to your ex. If it were registered to you, you probably would've mentioned that, right? So it's registered to him, correct?

The situation you describe is not sustainable. Dogs can live for tens of years. Were you ever really going to go hang out with your ex and his dog for the next 10 years? Probably not.

You could ask for the dog back, but at this point I'm pretty sure online girl would badger him into saying no just to spite you. Also, I'm not sure why you're acting surprised that your cheating ex-boyfriend's new girl doesn't trust him. I think it's time to move on."
"&gt;I think you should be honest that the HR lady contacted you.

Do not do this.
Keep all of your work information to yourself. Do not share anything because your ""friend"" will likely use it to hurt you.  Keep her out of your business.

"This is one sick situation you're in OP.  You've been groomed since 16.  Despite your dislike.  Despite you saying no.  He stomps all over your boundaries because he doesn't care.  You are being abused.  

Call your parents and go home.  Or call your friends and get out.  This is not healthy or a proper relationship.    "
"I had to send one of those emails once too. ""If you ever contact me again, even if it is to reply to this email, I will head immediately to the courthouse for a restraining order."" Haven't heard from him since. Sad it took that much to get him to leave me alone though."
"This is my favorite answer so far because I didn't feel like OP explained much in terms of their conversations of his allergy. He said that on their first date (they've been together 2 years) that she HEARD him mention the allergy to a waiter and ""even"" had a conversation about how her boss has the same allergy. 

If that's the extent of the dialogue on an allergy in a two year relationship--especially if it was all the same conversation once--then I wouldn't be surprised that she's unaware of the complexities. She might even think it's less severe than it is because they've barely talked about it. Also, if she's not well-informed, then it's possible she didn't know an almond is considered a tree nut.

Maybe OP forgot to mention that he reminds her once every other month or something? If that's the case, then I'm more sympathetic."
"Hell, I'm a little in love with him and I'm happily married. "
"Situations like this always blow my mind. Where does the entitlement come from? If one of my family members fell into money somehow, I wouldn't expect a dime. And I would be extremely grateful if they decided to share any portion of it with me."
"We've been together for almost 2 years now, but we wanted to take it slow in regards to his daughter so I've only gotten to know her for the past 4 or 5 months. 

He doesn't have a laptop, just a nice smart phone (which is off-limits for everyone). 

Yeah, I was quite shocked with what he said, especially after how patient I've been and how much effort I've quite obviously put in. I'm now beginning to worry that this is a huge warning sign for things to come. Will any amount of effort on my part ever matter or will it always be about him?"
"Buddy, even if you did do something wrong by not telling her that the diamond was a smidgen smaller than the one that she wanted, do you really want to be in a relationship where your partner handles conflict this way?"
"Your biological siblings both went No Contact for REASONS.  It's not easy enough for most people to fake being normal for a short period of time.  Don't fall for it.  Your bio parents have issues, probably fairly significant ones.

They only want to get close to you now that your siblings are NC.  In other words, you are your bio parents' second or third choice.  And they are only contacting you because they want something... Maybe they are lonely and want companionship, maybe they are getting older and want someone to take care of them, or maybe they want money.  They aren't contacting you out of love and caring for you, but for some selfish reasons of their own.

Your life was going well without your bio parents.  You have a family you love.  Then why would you risk bringing drama into your life by giving a third chance to these people who have done absolutely nothing to earn a place in your life?

If you are so inclined, you might contact your bio siblings and ask them if they can give you any information about your bio parents.  They may be able to shed more light on the kind of people you're dealing with."

Abraham Lincoln. 

I write this to show you that (1) you're not alone; and (2) you're incredibly brave. Do you know why?

Hundreds of thousands of people worldwide suffer from depression, anxiety, obsessive tendencies... And some suffer from schizophrenia or psychosis. Of all those people, very few ever admit there is a problem, seek help for a problem, or take ownership of their health to ensure they can live a happy and fulfilled life. 

You are doing ALL these things!

I don't know you, but I'm extremely proud of you, and I absolutely accept you! I know right now is a difficult time for you and you may not believe this, but it will get better and others will accept you and love you for YOU. 

It's OK to be scared. Always reach out when you're scared or unsure; silence solves nothing. "
"You say he has reams of women over at the weekends?
From the sound of it, I'd say the persistence and his behaviour is because you haven't given into his 'charms'. From his warped, entitled perspective you're an anomaly, a strike against his record that he wants to clear, because how could you *not* want him?

Having been in a similar position as the uninterested 1% with a previous manager, there's not much to say other than some people are dicks - and your neighbour is some people. 

Regarding your husband, show him your post and hopefully he'll come round, I can't imagine the frustration in being treated like the villain in this situation. "
"Our conversations go something along the lines of:

*Him*: Do you like my girlfriend? 

*Me*: I have a hard time making an opinion of her personality because she never says anything to me, but its rude that she does not talk to me, why is she like that?

*Him*: thats just the way she is, she has people problems.  Maybe you should be less talkative to her, &lt;or&gt; maybe she doesn't like your sense of humor &lt;or&gt; maybe [insert something that has to be with me but not with her]

*Me*: Yah I can clearly see that she has problems, but i'm not going to act differently because I cannot and I will not in my house. 

^^ We have had several conversations like this"
"Nope, but remember pro-life mommy and stepdad were the ones who insisted on the abortion. Pro-life is a great theory until your teenage daughter is the one who is shamefully pregnant, then you have to do mental gymnastics to justify getting rid of it so your family can appear ""perfect"". 

Katie hates OP already because of her childish delusions that OP is the reason her parents aren't together. She built up all the villainy OP has committed against her, and has latched on to that as a justification for her own ""sinfulness"", which nicely exonerates her in dickhead fiance's eyes, and lets her turn his wrath also onto OP. So fuck Katie, basically. I hope her marriage is miserable and dissolves before she gets pregnant again. "
I wish I'd known that when I was 16 and my ex-husband was 36 and we started dating. Would have saved me a lot of mental health problems :/
Then you end the conversation and leave. You train people how to treat you and if he isn't treating you with respect you don't have to tolerate it. You need to follow through with consequences if you want him to take you seriously. If he doesn't he may not be a friend worth having.

"Absolutely. This is prototypical abusive bullshit. I attacked you, but it's your fault.  It's not your fault.  Move out.  Bring a friend or a police escort when you do."
"I just wanted to say, regarding the footnote, I understand. You're describing the potential future realistically so OP and her fiance can better deal with it, not for other reasons. You sound like a very nice person."
"I'm sorry to hear about the whole thing. You wish he trusted you, he wishes you trusted him. I figured it was something like this because he said not to tell his mom, which as you and he acknowledged, you went and did. I think counseling would help you both feel comfortable trusting each other. I know your last post was pretty split about whether he was a good fiance or not, but I think he clearly laid out why he felt that he couldn't trust you. Maybe you come off as making a lot of assumptions and accusing him, while you feel like if he just told you a little bit, none of it would happen. 

Regardless, for some reason he feels he can't even tell you a little bit. Maybe he feels he should be able to tell his spouse stuff that stays between them and you have shown you can't do that multiple times.  If you want this to work, maybe self reflection on why he can't trust you might help. You already admit you don't feel like you know him anymore because he couldn't come to you, so you don't trust him to an extent. Counseling can help you guys communicate more effectively or help with trust issues. Maybe it's as simple as opening up to you about small things and in return you don't tell his mom. Baby steps. 

I'm not trying to say you shoulder all the blame in any way, I'm trying to suss out both sides. 


Edit: i wanted to add that while i see you said had he expressed it was a fragile situation, you wouldn't have said anything, I felt like he did express how fragile the situation was. I feel like he told you that it was serious and do not tell his mom and he would definitely tell you soon. Even the people split on ""how can she be with someone who hides something big"" and ""obviously theres a reason he can't tell her"" both understood it was a serious situation whatever it was. Just something to think about. "

"He gets what he wants and makes you feel guilty when you want something from him. Whether or not it's intentional - he's manipulating you to the point where you don't want to bring it up again and are happy to forego it entirely.

You need to be firmer with him. A relationship shouldn't be one-sided and this crack will only get bigger down the line. As you say you don't want this for the rest of your life.

Have a conversation with him reiterating you love him, but sex is important to you and also stop going down on him. To be honest four times a day is a high number and could be why he's not invested in other sex as he's getting satisfied this often without any effort."
"His girlfriend is stunning, and he's very attractive. When it first happened I went back and asked my best friend was I ""crazy"" to think the whole situation was strange. I just didn't get how he couldn't see why he shouldn't try to push me to date his friend."
Holy crap...I'm sure I do have some. Genius.
"Then you need to set boundaries. To make it very clear, without making it an attack on her. Then the ball is in her court to decide if she's going to respect your boundaries or not. 

I think a conversation something like this might be useful. 

""Nancy, I'd like to have a conversation with you, as 1 adult to another adult. I have only just met you, but I like you and I am glad you make my father happy. However, I want to make sure that you understand clearly that I am a 30 year old woman and I grew up with a loving mother who is still fully present in my life. You have a bond now with my father which I hope will make you both happy, but I hope you can respect that I do not need a new mother figure in my life. Our relationship is now of 2 adult women who happen to be related to each other by marriage. I hope we can have a friendly relationship, but I need you to accept that I am not your step-daughter and my children are not your step-grandchildren. You are my father's new wife. You have a role in my father's life that he's gone without, for a long time. He's told me how happy you make him and that makes me smile. As my father's new wife I am definitely hoping we can have a positive relationship. I don't yet know you very well and we may never be particularly close friends. But whether we do or not, I hope we can always get along as 2 mature respectful adults.""

One thing you should probably be aware of is that right now, Nancy is looking for her place in this situation. She probably feels threatened coming into a situation where a grown-ass woman (you) has a long term relationship with her new husband. That's probably the source of all this ""Oh I'm your new step-mother"" business. If you make it clear you see her being around for a long time and see you 2 getting along, at the same time as pointing out she's overstepping the mark by declaring herself your step-mother, you'll probably find it a lot easier for her to swallow."

"That's crazy. I've not liked a boyfriend's haircut before. I've said, ""Aw but you looked so cute before. Why is it so short now?"" And when he said, ""Because I like the feel of it better this way,"" that was the end of the conversation. A happy partner is an attractive partner anyway.

You don't have to feel terrible about your decision at all. He is the one acting ridiculous. Who tries to fix their SO's hair with superfoods?"

"100% jealousy. I've seen it dozens of times. It doesn't matter that you're fine with your body and she's unhappy with hers, healthy lifestyle or not, I have a lot of skinny girls in my entourage (btw 58kgs is okay): I heard one ultra-petite (45kgs) starting to say some nasty shit about her BEST FRIEND because she started to lose some serious weight and being super hot and confident.  
Just stay aware that this person is maybe not your friend. Friends who aren't happy because you happen to be more skinny/beautiful/fit/smart/rich/etc are not your friends."
He is an adult and you have to respect his decision even if you don't agree with it. You can't make him come back if he doesn't want to. Just leave him alone. He knows that you are interested in having a relationship with him again. If he wants that then he can seek you out. 
The Ned Stark plan is the stupidest plan to expose cheating. No offense.
"I had always looked at gift cards as being essentially ""free"" money for a business, since it is so common for a gift card to get purchased but left unused. Although, I can see why a manager wouldn't be pleased with that much just floating out there, since that is a *lot* of time that would then be ""non-profitable"" for a particular financial quarter/year... maybe? I have no idea, in an industry like that. 

Either way, good on you for keeping the gift cards. It was rather rude of her to try and take them back. Foolish of her to dump so much into the gift cards, too."
"I'd be upset if my fiancé spent thousands of dollars on a piece of jewellery I didn't like and didn't want and was now expected to wear it and show it off to everyone, too.

I wouldn't worry about it too much.  You're only 21 and aren't planning to get engaged for a while.  Maybe when the time comes you'll go together, and she'll fall in love with something else.  Or not.  Or maybe she'll find paying off the student loans more appealing than an engagement ring and will gladly accept an onion ring from you instead."

"100% cold honesty here: if I were your sister and you behaved that way at the funeral of my child, I would never forgive you. You could become a saint, cure cancer, devote your life to the poor and suffering and I would never want to lay eyes on you again for as long as I lived. And, I would absolutely despise you for trying to contact me again and insert yourself back in my life after such unforgivable behavior. 

You will never be anything else to her than the man you were at that moment and if you have any true remorse, you will never remind her of your existence again. Some things cannot be undone. "

"It is over.

For essentially 2 years you did not pull your weight in the relationship and now seem to think that 8 weeks of cleaning is enough to show her that you care and want to make a difference.  You seem to have an over romantic view that your actions are grand.  It is great that you are making an effort and want to participate in your relationship, but she is telling you how she feels and you are not listening.

She has told you she is done and that it is too little too late. She may have cheated and that is her fault, if she didn't she is heading down that road.

To be blunt, she may not be leaving you because of your mom's illness, and that is causing her to be miserable while also resenting you.

You should seriously consider breaking up with her for both of your sake.  You both deserve to live the lives that you want, unfortunately it may not be as a couple. 

You have a tough road a head of you with dealing with the impending loss of your mom.  My advice would be go to therapy, spend time with your mom, and figure out your goals in your life. Break up with your girlfriend."
"I would sit them both down and state the following:

*When Katie got pregnant, we told her we would support her no matter what decision she made. We told her that we would pay for her abortion and recovery, or we would help her to raise her child. Katie made the choice to have an abortion. We gave her several opportunities to change her mind, but this is what she felt was best for her. However, we did encourage Katie to get on birth control if she was having unprotected sex. Katie and her doctor made the decision that an IUD was best for her, and her father and I paid for her to get it. I never forced Katie to make a decision about her body, nor would I ever.*"
"In hindsight, she's definitely always been this possessive, not sure about the crazy/jealous but I assumed she was that as well.

Thinking back to our relationship, she pretty much made sure it was only ever the two of us doing things together. Most time was spent at her place or mine so we never did a lot of public stuff.

There were very few times where we would go outside of her comfort zone and interact with people.

I always assumed she was abused and fragile so I never really made a fuss about anything but we gave us trips and vacations pretty much every summer and winter because she didn't want to do it.

I know the real reason for her behavior now but back then (Before Vegas), I just thought she was extremely introverted and had some emotional trauma that we would have to work through at some point."
"Her: ""I feel like you're treating me like a child! Why don't you trust me?""

You: ""I feel like you are acting like a child when you break every valuable thing I own. I don't trust you because you have broken every valuable thing that I own."""

Am I meeting her? No. He wasn't originally going down to see her. A magazine reached out to him about his label and he decided to go to that city to meet with them about a potential job. She caught wind of it and told him she'd be in the city at the same time, so they're going to hang out. It makes me massively uncomfortable but I'm afraid to bring it up because I have a history of making an issue about girls like this that pop up in his life and he gets annoyed with me when I get jealous."
"You are making a lot of assumptions here.

You assume he has no idea what he's doing in his work. You assume he will die. You assume he will be better of with family than on his own.

You assume you know what's better for him than he does.

That is all after you've made an assumption about his mothers illness that you admit was wrong.

Please stop making assumptions and start treating your nephew with respect and trust instead."

Get out of there, man. Tell Becks that now isn't a great time. That you have to sort out your life, your separation/divorce, etc. That you might need a bit of time and space and you'd appreciate if she could respect that. Don't be stupid and cheat until you're actually through with your wife. But tell Becca that you care about her. And that now just isn't the greatest time.

"Everyone else has the neighbor issue solved: Stay in your car, restraining order, call the police, etc. but you clearly are equally upset that your husband doesn't believe you.

Have you been honest with your husband about how seriously unsafe you feel? Maybe you were subconsciously downplaying it because you thought you sounded silly.

But having asked your husband to come home early because you were scared should have been the tell-all. I would sit down with your husband and tell him how deeply hurt you are that he would insinuate that you provoked it. I don't mean to scare you, but what if Dave sexually assaulted you? Would it take *that* for your husband to believe you? Or would he still say you led him on?

Your husband may be doing some weird projecting here because he feels guilty about not having stepped in sooner or is having issues coping with not being able to protect you adequately while he is away."

"Totally this. In HS I had a close friend who is naturally SUPER thin. All of us would make jokes and stuff never realizing that she was actually pretty self conscious about it by the end. She straight up told us and it hit me how inappropriate it was. I felt awful and apologized a million times. Only reason I'm glad it happened is that it taught me to see it from another persons side. In my head being skinny was just amazing and I was super jealous, in hers we were constantly pointing out her body to her and picking it apart. I've never commented on anyones weight, small or fat, since. "
"Exactly!!! I'm not a parent but I'm pretty sure saying ""no"" to your kid every once in a while is important. You shouldn't have to *convince* them or manipulate them into not doing something (i.e showing her the laptop is for work). You're an adult, she's 5. Just say no!

It's even weirder because he DOES say no to lots of other things that he probably should let her do (like taking her socks off!)"

"You're being a codependent doormat, and the future is not pretty for you if you stay in this relationship. Giving an addict absolutely no consequences is the worst thing you could do. It just makes it easy for them to continue, and they don't have to confront the fact that they are behaving terribly."

"He wants you to be jealous, and he wants you to know about her. His over the top response was problematic. I am not liking this scenario."
"&gt;Get some perspective. It's not like they were raped, guys saw their titties. Big whoop.

So you're totally cool with people being able to access your private life (whatever that may entail) without your permission and just post it all over the Internet for anyone's consumption? 

The amount of entitlement men have towards women's bodies is staggering."
"I've lived in Texas and also experienced the joys of Zero Tolerance. In my case it was with a bullying/harassment issue but in my experience, if you threaten legal action they will concede. Lawyering up is the best idea. Talking to representatives is also a good idea. 

Cut off contact with James and Miranda until the hearing, but keep any contact they try to make with you on paper. "
"He is perfectly normal. He has nothing wrong with him at all. My mother is not happy about it. But she said there is nothing we can do. She is never home any way to care. 

She is to busy running around with her new boyfriend so Jane looks after nick most of the time"
"But what about important people who didn't invite you to their wedding?  My husband and I had a huge wedding (not like OP's - just 400), but there was a couple who we liked as friends and hung out with regularly who did not invite us to their rather large wedding.  They were intentionally excluded.  Out of sheer bitterness, I might add."
Why doesn't she declare bankruptcy and then find a rental within her means?
"I'm clumsy. I have ADHD, and an autoimmune disease that fucks with my balance/movements. You know who's shit I break the most? MINE. Because that's the stuff I use all the time. I have never, not once, broken something of my husbands and not replaced it asap. I have never, not once, thought this was a cute habit of mine. It annoys me to death, and I work so hard at being careful!

She is doing this on purpose. I don't know why, but she is, and that's insane. "
"I'm not sure that ""very few long-term relationships"" is the cause of this effect. Almost certainly the other way around."
"Your sister has a serious case of internalised misogyny which is why she thinks so little of herself that she feels the need to be dependent on a man and wants the same for you. Give her a chance to apologise. If she doesn't, put some distance between her and yourself. "
"Jesus Christ, dude, this post and your comments are depressing. I might be sensitive because I lost my little brother half a year ago. He was my best friend, 3 years younger than me, and every day since his death I mourn him and the future I'd imagined with him in my life. You clearly need some sort of therapy for issues you have had with your sibling, not the least because you are creating fissures in your family. It's almost like a self-fulfilling prophecy... you were so convinced your son would resent his little sister and be happier as an only child, you've distanced him from her.

YOU are the one who's going to ruin this sibling relationship, not your baby girl, if you don't get help."
"&gt;Yeah, this isn't about coffee. It's about a relationship she feels is doomed because you don't take responsibility for your actions. You said you kept the French press in the refrigerator because you did research, but further down the coffee you messed up was because you didn't learn how much coffee to grind and use. So yeah, that is kind of your fault.

And just.. grind more coffee? Sounds like you didn't do that because it was coffee for her, and not for you."
"Call cps. He's already molesting you guys, and will probably do much worse to your sisters. "
"&gt; I hate it, it hates me but I can't leave it

Yes, you can. Listen, we've all worked at toxic places before. Yours sounds especially toxic because of the size. You are not the new job police. You cannot ""fix"" this for the next person. Tough shit, but that's life. She'll either sink or swim.  Honestly, the job sounds miserable. You'd be better off letting her sink so she quits and moves on and won't get stuck in this unhealthy quagmire like you did."
"It's OK to have urges to play 2048, but if you're injuring your hand, it could be too much.

PS the desktop version lets you use the arrow keys instead of (I assume) swiping on your phone. Might be less stressful on the hand."
"&gt; And dont actions matter more than words?

Yeah, when it comes to promises, but don't be confused his posts ***were*** actions. He had to think about these things, type them up, and hit send. Not once while doing these multiple acts did he reconsider.

&gt; He also said he didn't know his words would actually hurt people, and that he wasn't actually a hateful person. 

He's lying. A 4 year old knows that words can actually hurt people and he is a hateful person. He's just good at hiding. Don't be stupid OP. **He knew what he was doing was wrong that's why he ASKED you not to look at his Twitter**. All he is doing now is lying in order to get you back.

&gt; No one could be that good at lying in real life unless they're a sociopath.

In real life he didn't say those hateful things because they would cause immediate consequences. Doing it online gave him the anonymity he needed to say the hateful things he thought about daily without facing consequences. Seriously OP, don't fall for his bullshit."
"It's so freaking cute. It's like one of those cheesy teen romance novels and I love it. Hope everything works out, OP! And congrats!!"
"Don't apologize, you did nothing wrong. She's only 20, I wonder if she knows what she is getting herself into. I feel sorry for your step daughter, this guy sounds like an ignorant religious extremist. Btw, why does he want YOU to apologize, what about her **dad**, he was there too...! I'm guessing good old misogyny. "
"That's totally ridiculous.  I'm not sure why you are even posting this...

&gt;She went on a rant about how I never treat her or care for her (both exaggerations considering I take her out every week and buy her gifts regularly), and how I need to ""clean up my act"" if we are to stay together, because I ""make too much to not treat her like a goddamn queen""

I would have dumped her on the spot and thanked her for making it such an easy decision.  "
"Just curious - a red flag for what ? 

Dealbreaker I can understand; but what does her past as a stripper flag for you ? That's she's sexually promiscuous ? Untrustworthy ? 

Also, I agree with most people on here - if you actually care for this lassie, but can't get over her past, be very gentle with her. Tell her that its just not working for you anymore and that you wish her all the best."
Pretty sure tenant laws don't apply if a crime has taken place.  But they may need the police to get involved if they want to take this route. 
"Dude, get over it. Jealousy is super unattractive. She's almost 30 years old. Be glad this is her only ""baggage"". If you can't deal with this, then I recommend only dating virginal 18 year olds in the future."
"&gt;For socializing what I found works for me is trying any amount of communication for any interaction... But when you go check out groceries, try and start something. ""Man this weather is so hot, I'll melt if I work outside."" Then gauge their response and go from there. It will allow you to feel more comfortable talking, conversing and you will better recognize social cues.

YES OP do this. I work in retail, and I discovered that by far my favorite task is cashiering because I get to have short conversations with strangers. I can make friends given repeated exposure to the same people (work, school, etc), but I never feel very confident in my ability to make and keep friends. Having short conversations with random people really helps me practice my people skills - I can try new conversation openers, phrases that other people use in conversation that I think would sound totally odd coming out of my mouth if I were talking to someone who knew me, etc. In short, **I can practice socializing on people who don't know I'm practicing on them** so if I put my foot in my mouth, oh well, they'll be out of my life in 30 seconds. 

Pretend you feel confident when talking to strangers, and they won't know the difference, and it'll get easier :)"
...That's rape :( 
"Dude, you're almost 30. She told you not to mess around with it, but I guess you didn't feel like listening? She laid out the rule, you broke it, now this is the consequence. Don't mess with people's stuff and especially not their medical tools and equipment."
"I have had to deal with this kind of situation as I have helped my dad with the social media aspect of his business (~20 employees ) over the years. 

Here's my advice: after you get a C&amp;D from your lawyer (and possibly look into a defamation /libel case), you can have your lawyer contact sites like Google, Youtube, and Yelp with the letters. They'll remove reviews that are related to Carrie. The more proof you have that it's her doing (like statements from witnesses, the texts) the better off you are.   Those sites don't like to lose credibility when it comes to reviews, nor do they want to get embroiled in legal proceedings - even small ones can become a huge issue on the internet

As for the forums and such,  you can message the mods and show them the documents  (make certain they are redacted). It's kind of a wish for the best scenario there, in all honesty. 

As frustrating as it is,  try to avoid directly posting about what she's done.  As a matter of fact,  only follow my advice if your lawyer okays it.  Your state (?) may have different laws,  or your lawyer may have another strategy.

Eventually,  this will blow over.  Your business isn't going to come from these people who are echoing her,  it will come from satisfied customers,  wedding planners, etc.  who spread your name.

I'm sorry this is happening.   I know how frustrating it is.  I've also had people who wrote reviews when they were angry accusing my dad of being a racist.  Thank goodness for surveillance videos.  "
"She was eight or nine, he was fourteen. He had implied they were the same age group but there's no way I would believe a fourteen year old genuinely felt so. When I was fourteen I was too cool to hang out with thirteen year olds. "
"What confuses me is her face is disgusting but somehow magically his penis is in her mouth? Like how did you refuses her kisses but let her undo your pants and remove your underwear? 

After the ""disgusting"" kisses why didn't he just LEAVE then?! "
"
So you told him what your boundary was, and he crossed it twice and paid for it. 

What other boundaries of yours has he ignored to get what he wants? Some people live by the motto that it's better to ask forgiveness than permission. Is that the kind of marriage you want?"
"well, first understand that you are not the reason for your parents fighting. you did not ask for this gym membership, and your education is an investment which will pay high dividends, especially if you keep up the good work. 

chances are there is more going on than you are seeing, but regardless  it's unfair of your parents to put you in this situation. most likely this fight is not about you,  but they've dragged you into it. even if you insisted they stop paying for the trainer, or took a part time job to fund your education, their fighting would not stop, and chances are you would still be caught in the middle."
"That's why doing it in a public place is important. It's really helpful that you're not living together. I'd try to meet up for coffee/lunch at a public restaurant or something, bring anything he's left at your place and firmly break up with him there. A Starbucks or something where there are other people around. 

If he has a key to your place or there is any risk he may have made a copy of your key, I'd change your locks or talk to your landlord about changing them ASAP if you're renting. 

Keep your doors locked and if he tries to come by when you're home, call the police immediately. Don't even try to talk him down, just call the police and explain to them that your ex who has a history of domestic violence is outside of your place and will not leave."
"So he was RP'ing you then went full creeper and is a violent, right-wing nutjob? Color me shocked.

Look into that first suggestion in the comments and actually try to get across to the judge you fear for your safety. Or whatever you call them there. Just make sure to hold on to all evidence and document it properly."
"&gt;But on the other hand, I think I'd rather find out about my fiance/husband's lack of respect on my wedding day, so I could start divorce proceedings immediately, rather than 10 years down the line.

Both are awful situations though if there were signs of concern *before* the wedding day."
"You really have no recourse. They're liars and liars lie, but people aren't going bankrupt donating to their gofundme or whatever. Did you know a lot of the homeless people you see begging on street corners actually have homes? And you're allowed to go on gofundme and say ""I wanna be an actress, gimme money!"" even if you're a trust fund kid. Asking for money and lying isn't illegal, it's just shitty.

You could do some kind of social media esposee and say ""Look guys, we're tired of witnessing our family lie to pull money out of well-meaning people. The family is doing fine and, although the fire is tragic, the Smiths still have hundreds of thousands of dollars. Please spend your donation money where people actually need it, like X charity or Y homeless shelter. It's difficult to stay silent while a group of wealthy people profit off of others' selflessness.""

Of course, that would totally ruin your relationship with your in-laws. If anyone you know personally is donating, I'd tell them in confidence to donate somewhere else and explain the situation. Otherwise, you're just going to have to come to terms with the fact that your husband's family is terrible."
You guys are right. :( Shit. 
You're handling this perfectly. Carry on and minimize contact as necessary. Particularly if your kids are going to be exposed to racism/having half of their heritage bashed.
"Look he was an ass and really really really not helping.

But you have to go back to inpatient treatment if you're back to 500 calories. Do your doctors know about this?

Roger feels helpless because you're killing yourself but what he's doing is not helping. I understand you not wanting to see him right now, what he did may be the most unhelpful thing to do to someone with an eating disorder ever. 

But please go back to your therapist and dietician. I'm sorry but 500 calories and purging again does not sound like being on the road to recovery. 
"
What could he possibly say that would turn this around for you?
"Here's the thing. It won't stop with the vacation fund. It won't. Next it will be money saved for a kitchen repair for you, your own new car fund (that you need to drive your child around safely), and your child's college fund. It will never stop. These people actually said *that they want you to stop buying your child things so you can give them more money.*

Let your husband read these comments, or paraphrase them for him. If you don't draw a hard line at some point,  they will - for the rest of your life - be asking for more and more and more, to the detriment of your life and your children's lives."
"Then let me spell it out. You tell her that the girl you want to marry will love you for who you are, not the size of the ring you put on her finger. Tell her the demands and expectations she put on you and the attitude in which she gave you make her not the woman you want to marry. "
"&gt; I wouldn't confront him, just ask him

Confronting him **is** asking him. Confronting someone doesn't have to be one person screaming in another's face. Confront can just mean ""to deal with something in an honest and direct way"", which is something that approximately 98.1241% of the people who post on this sub seem to misunderstand. "
"Also here's a line I used when my (very nosey and naggy) mom told me that my dad thought I was doing porn. I burst into laughter and said ""I fucking WISH! I'd be making so much more money. Do you really think I'd still be [living at home/insert whatever thing that could be solved with stacks of cash here] if I were?"" 

My mom actually nodded and never mentioned it again. 


Make it the joke that it is!"
"So my brother and I didn't get along AT ALL when we were younger. We fought, yes, but siblings fight. Your brother and you didn't fight- he just straight up ABUSED you. HE BEAT YOU WITH A FUCKING POWER CABLE. HE ALMOST **PARALYZED**  YOU BY THROWING YOU OFF THE TRAMPOLINE.

Your Dad is not a nice guy. He's a terrible guy, actually, for allowing this to happen and BLAMING YOU. I'd cut contact with my entire family if I were you. Are you aware that you're lucky you aren't more seriously injured or dead by now? Seriously. That's how bad this is. Your father doesn't give a fuck about your health or safety. You will never be a ""happy family"" because your brother is abusive and YOUR FATHER REFUSES TO ALLOW HIM TO LEARN. Your brother should be in jail, honestly- your father is the reason this maniac is running around in public assaulting people."
"Said the same thing to him. His response was ""So be it."""
"&gt;snooping

It apparently was on their *shared* computer, in a directory dedicated to taxes. She didn't intrude on his privacy.

&gt;No, she isn't owed anything. By her own admission, she went snooping with the intention of shaming him. Serves her right to get creeped out!

Even if she had obtained the information by snooping, marriage isn't the court of law. Illegally obtained evidence doesn't get thrown out. He doesn't get to have her keep silent and play cool while being creeped out by his weird shit.

&gt;something you knew was important to him

She thought it was a mundane crush on a celebrity of the kind we all had. Those are not supposed to be important [EDIT: and since she thought she knew about his crush, it was not supposed to be secret, either]. She only found out it was important (to the point of obsession, apparently) after she looked.


EDIT:
&gt;Edit: And he is shitty to keep copies of her leaked photos, but that is besides the point.

That is a good point, actually."
"First thing to not say a word, act normal and hire a private investigator.  If you confront him he will most likely deny it so you have to look out for yourself. Find out some facts before confronting.

If you can't afford a PI you can try to do these things yourself but you have to be willing to put on an act. These are both risky options, but do with it what you will:

Since you know about temping, why not call the school yourself tomorrow acting like he is applying for a job and you are checking his reference? Not sure if the temp report explicitly did that, but call his references from that time. Second option would be to FB this girls mother and talk to her. If her daughter is making shit up she should know, and if it's true she could tell you.

Good luck. Keep your cool and get the facts. Protect yourself FIRST because this could be very damaging! Hopefully it isn't, but by finding out the facts before confronting he will not be able to gaslight your or emotionally sway you into believing him."
"This. You are not on the hook to take care of him when your MIL is unable to (which might happen before she dies, depending on how her health goes). There are alternatives, and some of those alternatives would be paid for by is SSD. Look into them, and make a plan."
"This is Reddit, and I'm holding the fuck up. First of all, you never should have attacked her about how she spends her time. This stance is futile and irrelevant. What is is relevant, however, is that she has no right to be a party in any discussions regarding rearing this child. That's the correct position you should take. Move to that high ground and get off of your soapbox about her activities."
"Also OP, sweep your house for surveillance equipment, check your car for tracking devices and your tooth brush is compromised.

But for reals also change your locks if she has a copy of your key."
"I think it's all a bit of light hearted humour you're reading too much into.

Admittedly it is a tad strange that your wife and pal are texting buddies in the first place,but based off those txt examples I really don't think anything is going on. "
"Yeah, they can both like and dislike whatever they want, but it's how you express the feeling that decides whether you're a douche. Not liking it, even expressing it, even breaking up? Fine. Compiling lists of why *she* should hate her hair like it's some complex moral quandary and then acting like a passive aggressive asshat when that spectacularly entitled plan fails? Not fine.

If it's that big a deal, he can walk away. If it's not so big a deal that he wants to walk, then he can suck it up. It's called maturity."
"You can try scar cream. I've used it for my self harm scars, and over about a year they've lessened. 

But honestly, I just say fuck it and wear what I want. My scars are a part of me now. I've ""reclaimed"" some of them by getting tattoos, so you could also look into that as well."
"Then he didn't apologise, it was lip service. How long has this been going on?  "
There was another where a guy with Aspergers found out he's not asexual and had his first kiss.
"Let's be honest, even if you did apologise and were welcomed back at family events, do you think your husband's family would ever let this go? They would definitely bring it up as an argument if you ever disagreed with them again. 

If Katie is old enough (and stupid enough) to get married to this guy, then she's old enough to take responsibility for her own actions and not thoughtlessly blame you for ""ruining her life."" 

I can't really see any situation here that doesn't lead to you and your husband having to cut his family out of your lives. They sound terrible so it would hardly be a loss, but I'm sorry you've had to go through all of this :( "
Do you really not ever take the 5 month old anywhere?  Your poor wife!  If she never gets a break from the 5 month old how is she supposed to have any energy to give your son the attention you think he needs?
"Tubby Wubby......

Seriously, and you thought that was ok?"
"Okay maybe, just maybe, since he's a fiction writer, this folder is somehow related to a tax write off from 2014.....lol, I can't even keep a straight face.

Ok, serious...You know you have to ask him, right? This cannot go unaddressed."
"Yeah. He has a perfectly reasonable explanation for not speaking the language. And even if it was a passive aggressive ploy to somehow know what people were saying about him, so what? Break up with him if that is a problem, but OP, what is really terrible here is how people have treated him because they didn't think he could understand what they said. 

There is a side of me that is really proud of what he did, especially because he stood by you through so much ridicule and STILL PROPOSED TO YOU. 

Imagine if he came here and asked us for advice. What advice do you think he'd get, OP, if he said ""my fiance somewhat defends me when people are rude to me in Korean, a language I understand but refuse to speak, and she continues to enable them and allow them to insult me, what do I do, Reddit?"" Personally, I'd tell that guy to confront you, or get out. This guy is a better man than me.  "
"&gt; my fiance keeps telling me I have no obligation to do so since its my brothers child

He is correct. 

&gt; I am in fear that she will call the police on me over this.

The police will not take this seriously, you have no Duty of Care towards any children apart from your own
"
"bet my left butt cheek he's the type to call people ""sheeple"""
"Honestly, I work at a university - and I'm a little surprised that Mark has approached this so casually. Often the appearance of impropriety is enough to get people stirred up - being seen together romantically so close after you just had him as an advisor may raise questions for other students or other faculty. In the context where his feelings for you may have impacted his support or grading - other people may be concerned.

Keep in mind - I'm not calling out anything as right or wrong here, but I am very familiar with the environment, and he may well be under some scrutiny at work based on the information you've shared. Asking a student out as you hand them a recommendation letter may look like soliciting favors. I understand you didn't utilize the letter, but on his end - this may raise questions. 

I don't think you get anything out of engaging with Sam, because that's a ridiculous way for her to address the concern. But yes, you tell Mark - because those kind of concerns can spread like wildfire, and it might actually get worse.
 "
"Well the congratulations letter for her latest movie OP said was a recently released, so he has accessed it fairly recently to add more stuff to his weird hobby"
"Ya, he jokes and says its to punish me and says I could never drown in a bath tub but yes I can if you're holding me underwater! Its insane."
"You have been together for 12 years so I'm not going to be so quick to jump to a split. 

However you didn't delve into **why** your wife wants another child, and **why** you don't. 

Is it the cost in time? Is it the cost in money? Your own mental workload? Does your wife want a sibling for the current child? 

Would you change your mind if you had more help around the house? Like a nanny or a housekeeper? Could you move to a place where your family could help you out more? Would you change your mind if the next child came later on, after the current child needs less attention? 
I note that your wife is 34 so perhaps she feels that it's ""now or never"" since past 35 is the ""high-risk"" pregnancy zone. You could consider freezing her eggs if it's an issue of timing. However you would have to be wary about her suspicion that ""later"" would become ""never"". Still, I had friends who waited for 3 years before having their next child.

Unfortunately I don't have many ideas on how to get her to budge. If she wants a sibling for your current son maybe you could move somewhere where your family could be close to cousins so he could bond with them? (If there are any)

I think if you take some time to understand each other's motivations perhaps you'll find something you can both live with. Although the destination is going to be 1 child or 2, the path you take to get there is important. 

"
Does OP have any indication that the person texting her is who she says and not just the ex trying to manipulate her or make contact again?
"Your boyfriend tried to force you to eat something you're allergic to. Let that sink in for a minute. He spent time making, and expected you to eat something HE MADE, that he KNEW you were allergic to. That is some incredibly messed up nonsense right there. And when you called him on it, he threw a temper tantrum and launched a plate of food at you. I don't know how severe your allergy is, but there are some people who can't even be in the same room as the food they're allergic to. IANAD, but I'm pretty sure the more you're exposed to an allergy, the worse the reaction can get. I might be incorrect on that though, but still. 

And now he is pouting because you called him on his nonsense. It's mind boggling to me. Has he acted like this before? Your post seems to indicate this is incredibly out of left field for him, so I'm going to go out on a limb and say something happened that made him want to give up getting healthy, and he's projecting that onto you. It's a cruddy thing to do, but it explains his hostility. Maybe he hit a plateau? Someone said something rude to him at the gym? He noticed someone checking you out and got jealous because he hasn't noticed anymore female attention directed his way since he started getting healthy? I have no idea honestly, it could be anything. Or he's decided for whatever reason that he wants to nuke the relationship, and is taking the cowards way out by trying to get you to break up with him so he doesn't look like the bad guy.

The only way you're going to get an answer is if he tells you, so I wouldn't hold your breath on getting what you want. As for how you respond, I'd send one last text, something like this:

I don't understand why you wanted me to make myself sick by eating the food you prepared last night. Your reaction to my refusal was unacceptable, and I will not tolerate being treated this way. Something is clearly bothering you, and as your partner, I am here to help you work through it, but I will not be abused. I didn't ask you to diet and exercise with me, you decided to do that on your own, and I would completely respect your choice to stop doing those things. I simply ask for the same amount of respect and consideration. If you can't grant me that request, we have bigger problems than meal time to discuss, and I don't want it to devolve into a screaming match, so please let me know when you're ready to have an adult conversation that doesn't involve throwing food at me."
A guy who negs a woman would rather she sleep with him because she hates herself than have them sleep together because they actually like each other. Hard pass.
"60 days in the realm of job searching is nothing.  She needs to be patient and keep trying.  I was unemployed for a year once and submitted so many apps I lost count.

Don't force yourself into a job for her.  If anything, take that offer of a raise at another company and negotiate with your current job.  You are obviously underpaid and you may be able to bargain for a higher salary at your current job."
"At what point in this post did she make any compromises? Did you leave those out or is your entire relationship just her dictating what you should do and how you should feel? 

It sounds like you have some things to talk about and work through, and you could probably come to some decent compromises about sex and activity time, but her idea of working through things is telling you what she wants and expecting you to toe the line, which isn't healthy.

It sounds like she might benefit from therapy if she has the entitled only child thing going on, but she also sounds unapologetic about it, so it won't work if she doesn't care. Relationships are a two-way street, and she's not letting any traffic come through your side of the highway."
Seriously. What an entitled idiot. 
"Your failure in parenting isn't from not being able to afford nice things, it's by allowing your daughter to treat you like shit. You are letting your guilt of being a single parent turn you into someone to be walked all over. You are NOT her friend, you are her PARENT.

You start being harsher with her. Next time she talks back to you, GROUND HER. Your daughter thinks of you as an ATM, she is ungrateful, and she needs to start respecting the sacrifices you made for her. Start being way harder on her. She's way out of line. 

You don't deserve this treatment. Stop worrying about making her ""content"" or ""liking you."" Start building her character instead."
"You handled it just fine. You didn't lead him on, and don't let him try to guilt-trip you with that lie.

He is the one who led you on, into thinking you could just be friends. He's the one who lied, when he pretended things could remain platonic between you. He's pulling classic Nice Guy stuff, and you're being entirely too tolerant."
"Yes, two separate therapists told my friend this. In that case it was one time, she felt horrible abut it and the therapists said that telling him would make her feel better at the expense of his feelings. "
"Then he shouldn't have decided to have children. He should have gotten a vasectomy. He shouldn't have put himself in ""temptations way"" with children in the house. The VAST MAJORITY of CSA is father to child, and he knows this. "
"Tell them he is financially independent from you and has a higher salary. And then leave the subject alone. Some things you can't make people believe or understand because of their prejudice, and you just have to let them see on their own. "
"Yeah, it sounds like she was actually plucking them out.

I can't tell if Op realizes this and thinks it's worse or didn't make the connection."

"You process it and move from there.

Sex, virginity, relationships, it is all highly volatile. You got struck by lightning in a way. Reflect on it. Take some quiet time if you need it. Don't worry about future partners. If they judge you for a decision you enjoyed they are probably not a good partner. Your sex life is your business.

Take today. Then tomorrow. Enjoy the weekend. Debate your new sexual awareness."
"I think maybe you should talk to Chad to get a clear idea on how he feels and then have a seperate, sit down conversation with Stephanie. 


Start with ""No one wants to hurt you or make you feel forced into making a decision but we need to talk about the car. We have some concerns and all that we ask right now is that you listen to them and try to understand where we are coming from. Once we've said what we feel needs to be said, we'll give you as much time as you need to talk about your perspective and how you are feeling about it all.""


Then, give her that. She needs to feel, at least somewhat, like she is making the decision to examine the issue of the car herself, that she is being listened to and not just being told to give the car up ""because it's not fair"". Focus your talking points on the ways it affects her as well as the family unit as a whole. 


* Why *doesn't* she get the title to the car? Without it, she is not the legal owner. How can they be giving her a car if the car legally does not belong to her? It's pretty unfair on her that she's being forced into a position where she feels like she has to push her brother away in order to keep the first ""grown up"", super expensive thing she's ever had. Be sympathetic, this sounds incredibly stressful on her!


* Your husband should talk to her *in a child appropriate way* about conditional gifts and how often times they're not just about kindness but achieving some kind of goal. I think it's awfully early but this issue may turn out to be a very good reason to gently introduce the information that grandma and grandad were not very pleased with who he chose to date. Sometimes parents have valid concerns about relationships and it's good to listen to them and think carefully about what they have to say... but sometimes parents of adults can have problems letting go of the ""because I said so"" mentality. That can be a problem when they're objecting to who you choose to build a life with. Talk about how she'd feel if she brought home a boyfriend/girlfriend and you rejected them on grounds like ""I don't like how he speaks"" or ""he dresses wrong"" rather than ""He seems kind of rude towards you"" or ""hey, did I hear him say he wanted to check your phone to see if you were texting any guys?!"". You guys are probably going to run into this exact same issue with her at some point so you might as well humanise it and use it as an opportunity to introduce the idea that it you critique her future partners, it'll be for genuine concerns, not a kneejerk reaction.


* So, what happens when a parent does *not* want their child's new partner to be part of the family but they're too old for ""no"" to work? They chose more subtle ways to work towards what they want. Ask her how her relationship has been with Chad since the car was brought into the picture and how she feels when he walks out of the room when she starts talking about the car. Does she feel better or worse overall - or is it hard to tell because things are so complicated? How does she feel about you and Chad, when she was told that she and her brother could not both get cars because it wouldn't be fair and, now that she has one, things are tense? 


Really unpack those emotions and try to *kindly and gently* nudge her towards thinking about how her grandparents would have known the impact this decision would have before they gave her the car. She shouldn't have to come to any conclusions yet, just get a read on how she's feeling and introduce the idea that this is a highly conditional gift. Get her thinking about how it affects her emotional wellbeing and is unfair on her as well as everyone else and then just listen. Mop up tears, listen to her if she shouts, reiterate that you both love her and you're on her side. 


I'm of the opinion that, if Stephanie can get the title and have the fear of the car being removed if Chad is in the car taken away, she should be allowed to keep it. Then she could share with her brother when appropriate and start mending fences with him - maybe by helping him commute to work until he can afford his own car? Working to pay for petrol would be a great way to learn some responsibility and, whilst it is not 100% fair, nothing about this situation is. If she and Chad can turn the car into something to unite over, fantastic. 


If grandma and grandad refuse to give her the title, though, then the car doesn't really belong to her and you guys need to go over all the potential legal potholes that come along with that. It's not a real gift and I think Stephanie needs to be, very kindly, lead to that conclusion and supported through the realisation that her grandparents aren't as great people as she thought. 

*Edit: Y'know what, having just written out a wall of text, I think /u/dahlialia's suggestion of a family therapist is probably a lot safer. You could probably have great individual talks with each kid but the second they come together, they're going to have problems not bouncing off each other. They both need to feel heard and a skilled mediator is probably going to be worth their weight in gold.*"
"29 is the max age for enlisted and I believe that 28 is the max age for officers. That said, both of those can be waived on a case by case basis. He'll also need waivers for his dependent(s). He already has a bachelors degree, so he's eligible to become an officer (except for the age thing). 

So here's some unsolicited advice, maybe you can use it in a conversation with him. Hopefully he's aware that by Marine standards he's really old. If he enlists, his immediate supervisor will likely not be old enough to buy alcohol. Old guys have to be *really super ok* with that potential friction.

What he's interested in doing in the Marine Corps is also important, because it dictates how often he'll be around. I love Marines because so many of us are just happy to be Marines regardless of our actual job (MOS), but the downside to that is that lots of us joined with that same fever and took crappy jobs that keep us away from home a lot and wear us out. It's cool that he wants to be a Marine, but he really needs to have a little more detailed goal than that. I dont want him to ""join ASAP"" only to be miserable for the next 4 years. 

Laslty, he needs to be ok with the fact that a recruiter might just flat send him away. He's old, he's overeducated, he's got a family, and meanwhile the Marine Corps is getting smaller and there is a whole line of 18 year olds who will sign up with a lot less drama (and effort for the recruiter). Neither of you should be surprised if a recruiter doesnt return his calls. "
"Honestly......I think you need to let this man go.

He doesn't trust you. From the sounds of it, he has good reason to. He feels that you can't keep anything to yourself, and I'm kinda with him on that. Hell, he can't even keep his mother as distant from himself as he would like because you want a relationship with her and apparently totally disregarded his feelings on it (despite knowing he had a rough childhood and the fights about his mom....). 

He sounds like a good guy. He put himself out there to help out two other people, and even refunded the wedding costs and made himself the bad guy to make sure you looked good. 

If this works out, or you get in another relationship, learn from your mistakes. When someone tells you something, don't run to someone else and tell it to them. When someone says they aren't comfortable, listen to them. 

&gt;He brought up a time which I thought was unfair when one of the girls on his team had come to him with sensitive information which he helped her communicate to her parents. It was one of the first times he had told me about something like that and I ended up telling his mom months later in some random conversation.

This right there. This behavior is so not okay. He told you something, in confidence. And you told him mom, who he clearly has issues with. His mom tried to blurt out the secret. And yet...you kept doing this behavior. Hell, if your first post, you went behind his back *after he asked you not to* and blurted exactly what he asked you not to. He was trying to see if he could trust you not to screw him on this....and you proved that he couldn't. 

&gt;But since that day he's been tolerating her, for my sake. We did get into a argument about it years back and I feel like an ass for guilt-tripping him because now I know why he didn't want me spending time with his mom.

You say you didn't know....but when someone is fighting with you over it, you need to actually listen to what they are telling you instead of guilt tripping them for having an opinion (especially over someone they know *way* better than you do.) 

He's not perfect. Obviously, he should have communicated better overall. But you need to learn to respect your partner. "
"Or, just interjecting here, instead of you making it for him, he could make his own food because he is an adult and there is no reason you should automatically cook for him, especially if you are having separate food. "
Jesus Christ.... Did you even read the comments of the previous post?? 
"You didn't want to be in this relationhip. It'd be cruel (to both of you) of you to stay in a relationship where you knew you didn't want to be in it. It is never more cruel to break up with someone than to stay in a relationship that you are unhappy with. If anyone was cruel, it would be him for begging and not respecting your decision. 


That being said, I hope it wasn't completely out of the blue. That he knew there were things not working out and that you didn't spend the last few months just lying about being happy. That'd be cruel."
2 year relationship without sex? Totally reasonable.

Did you give her a time limit on being no contact? because otherwise this doesn't make sense. Or, was it: don't contact me, when I'm ready, I'll contact you?

And on that topic: do you really think this is something you can get past? I'm not saying that in a facetious manner, I think cheating is something some couples/people can get past and some can't. 

Above all, I agree with your assessment that she is thinking primarily of herself. The fact that she waited a mere two weeks before messaging you (after being asked not to!) is proof of that. I am very sorry this happened to you."

One who would let you choose when you're ready.  This person is not respecting your boundaries.  "
I feel like putting everyone on the phone together was the low point.
"Don't be so hard on yourself, sounds like he worked very hard at deceiving you. It also sounds like that incident was probably some sort of non-consensual messed up shit, and his family absolutely should have said something before you married. Take the money and run."

"&gt; cats are not low maintenance

I've had five indoor cats, mostly starting as kittens, and I'd say that individual temperment varies of course, but that overall, cats -do- tend to be low-maintenance.  Also, I've found that any problem behavior is not unsolvable for the most part.  Of course I would certainly agree that there has to be at least one responsible person who is attentive to the cat's needs, which is more about mindset than it is sheer work.

Having said all that, I'm not convinced the GF would be that responsible person that the cat needs.  She is not making a good case for herself IMO."
"&gt; threw a toy car at our toddler 

That's the end point, OP, right there. That's the stopping point.

You want to put up with him abusing you, that's your choice. It's a sad choice, it won't make you healthier over the long run, but some people make it. They look at the options--_stay with my partner that I love intensely, and endure this, or no longer have to endure this but be without them_--and they reckon it a fair trade.

You do not have the right to make that trade for your children.

Do you think you could do a couple of awful little Google searches for me? Try ""Green stick fracture."" Try ""unexplained retinal hemorrhage."" Try ""posterior rib fracture""+""compression injury.""

Children are so very breakable. Your husband can not be trusted around his pregnant wife, and you're an adult who can at least begin to protect herself.

He threw a toy car at a small child.  Try Children+""Brain injury.""

You get to make whatever choices for yourself you're willing to settle through. You do _not_ have the moral right to do that for your children. Your children must be protected beyond what you are allowed to choose for yourself."

"I know that there are a ton of other issues here, but I am only going to address the photographic ones. When I got heavily into amateur photography, I became super critical of all photographs, especially my own. There are times when I go out to shoot pictures, and I will take 500 shots and only really like 1 or 2. Sometimes, I don't like any of them, and I just delete them all. 

I am reluctant to share any of my own photos unless I am proud of them. I know that my family just wants copies of the family snaps, but sometimes, I have a really hard time releasing a photo that I consider to be below my standard, and believe me, most of what I capture falls into this category. "

Yes, testing someone is bad and dumb.  Dysfunctional and really unnecessary.   Like I said - she's getting something from this behavior, something she likes and wants.  Stop giving it to her because this behavior is making you feel terrible.  "

"Talk to a lawyer right now. It's not on you to appease his family. There is a reason you were chosen. I'm going to guess Ed didn't think very highly of his family if he didn't leave them the business and didn't warn them of his decision. This is a brilliant opportunity for you. You need a lawyer to pen a cease and desist letter to each family member. You need to document all threats and take police action on any that are physical. If they continue, then get restraining orders. "

"Everyone has pretty much said what I think, I just wanted to add: many comments talk about all ""3"" girls - No! That is still unequal and unfair.

"I think that money is gone for good, and so is your friendship. Sorry, mate. It's a bitter pill to swallow. 

Interesting that your wife doesn't trust him though and hasn't for some time. How long has he been a source of aggro for her? I'd say whatever the backstory is, she's had the right idea for a while. I wonder what she saw that you and the rest of your mates didn't?

Do you think maybe there might have been a few warning flags thrown up earlier, but you and the guys gave him a free pass he didn't deserve for the sake of a decades-long friendship?"
"&gt;This would all be great, but suddenly it has started to make me question things. I wonder if he was really attracted to me five years ago.

He married you and made babies with you. I think it's safe to assume that he was indeed attracted to you, hon. Just because he might have a preference doesn't mean he doesn't find you attractive. Those people he said were hot? He didn't marry them. 

If you are worried about what will happen if you lose weight, talk to him. Tell him you aren't comfortable with your current body, but let him say his piece. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't lose weight if you want to. Just don't let the passion fizzle out. Express interest. Keep having fun together. Think of things to try together. 

Until then....enjoy having really awesome sex. 

"
"Yup, can confirm. I was always that girl that made the first move. It threw a few guys off but if I liked a guy why not? Wound up eventually proposing to one of them and we are about to hit 11 great years together.

"First off, like /u/C1awed said, be up front about your feelings. This is a pretty big deal.

Secondly, hi there, I'm a Marine, and one of the mods over at /r/USMC. Has he talked about any kind of timeline with you regarding when he wants to go? Do you know if he has talked to a recruiter yet? I ask because (aside from the relationship issues around plotting this without you), if he hasnt talked to a recruiter yet he likely wont be leaving any time soon. After his initial training you'll be welcome to go live wherever he lives, which leaves some unanswered questions regarding what he planned on doing with that new house...

If you have any questions about the Marine Corps or his options I'm happy to help, I'm not a recruiter, just a dude who knows the system. "
"&gt; Me: ""Hi Tom! What time you getting off work today?""
&gt; Tom: ""None of your damn business""
&gt; I thought this was a joke as we have always had a wonderful time working together - always smiling and laughing with each other, although never in a jokingly rude way before so I was a bit uneasy but went on saying ""I was just wondering if before you left if you could move one of your tubs into a different sink since I have to -""
&gt; Tom cuts me off and raises his voice: ""Don't you tell me what to do, you're just a little girl, a little useless girl. Maybe you should actually do your job and wash the equipment instead of trying to get me to do it""

This is bullshit. I work in a Maintenance department for a large organization and we always keep in respect as to the needs to keep operations going.  Meaning if you are short a cooler or sink, as long as you can provide a temporary fix (move the product to another freezer until we get parts or plumbing needs a work around) we do it.  We know that there is an operations at hand.  He shut down the operations without any consideration which is a bit on the asshole side and surprised any colleagues of his, especially the owner would find shutting down an option....makes no sense.  You want to find alternatives, not shut the operations down.

But with that, being called a ""little girl""?  I've been in male dominated fields on and off since I was 18 and now in my mid-40's.  This is unacceptable and insulting.  You simply asked a job related and operational question so you know how to improvise or what to expect and this guy shits on you because you're younger and he's older? 

If anything, I'd start applying at other places.  This place apparently is full of not just misogynistic bullshit, but apparently doesn't care about operations and how to work around because of this asshole. 

If there is an issue as to keeping equipment clean so it doesn't go to shit, that's on your manager's head.  We see this a lot and we nip it at the bud.  If there is any equipment be it a machine, plumbing, electrical and the issue is caused by lack of cleaning or other protocol and you're not aware of it? Still doesn't excuse him for calling you a ""little girl"".  If anything, any lack of routine or needed cleaning is on the manager's and ultimately the owners head. 

For instance, we get the occasional ""floor drain clogged in the kitchen"" and turns out its because their dishies who mop the floor shove shit down the drains after removing the drain guards to prevent clogging.  Is that on us because we ensure plumbing? No... it's on the Chef and his staff because the floor drains are because your staff is doing stupid shit. Then we ask, ""Have you reprimanded or trained such staff NOT to do that?"" and if the answer is ""no"" then well, that's on them, not on us.  Seems this dude is trying to take advantage of that - though no reason to disparage you because you're younger.  He also comes off as a heavy drinker.  Not saying he is, but this kind of asshole stuff from handymen is usually the case based on my experience.

Mr. Shrivel dick needs to realize he needs to take up any sort of cleaning maintenance issues up not with you, the staff, but the owner and/or management. Regardless, that's just unacceptable to call you a ""little girl"" and cut you off when you're simply communicating a problem and seeking a solution.  

You're not the problem...and I definitely suggest to remove yourself from this company if you can and move on to some other organization or business that has professionals in management and with their handymen or repair vendor technicians. "
"So, there seems to be a lot of focus here on Izzy's interests and how she's expressing herself in mean and hurtful ways and needs to learn to argue respectfully, but are we putting the cart before the horse here?

She yelled at her father and accused him of showing favoritism too. She feels a LOT of anger and resentment. Look past the feminism thing, she's trying to take the golden child down a peg. She's using the words she's found from an angry part of the internet to make herself feel superior to her sister whom her mother favors.

You can probably argue with her that being judgmental of a woman's choices is anti feminist until your face turns blue, and she probably won't listen because it's not the root issue and she's an angry teenager who doesn't understand her own feelings well enough to express them in a constructive way. 

Look through the archives on this very forum. Favoritism in families causes all kinds of nasty blood feuds. I could totally be wrong of course but you might want to consider that her politically-charged snide comments are the weapon she's using to express her frustration."

Also of note: lots of abusers are very good at getting their friends on their side and painting former victims as ""crazy.""

Can you handle that it's a long, downhill slope from this point - that in years to come, you'll look back at this moment and think how happy you once were?

It's tough to leave. It's tough to uproot yourself. But unless he willingly goes to therapy, kicks the addiction, and makes such wholesale changes to himself that it's like ripping a house down and rebuilding it rather than renovating, then you're a mug for staying with him.

There's someone out there who when you're asked to say something nice about them, five things will spring to your tongue. And not one of them will be ""he's better now that he doesn't do drugs, and is just an alcoholic instead""."
"I would talk to him about it. Guaranteed he's going to be ashamed, so I don't know how he'll respond (sad or angry). This is an unhealthy obsession, though, and attacking him won't go over well. He needs help. You two can decide what you want to do with your marriage afterward, but he needs therapy first. Bad."
"I remember the exact moment I lost all faith in humanity, and it was in nursing school when we were taught that pregnancy is a risk factor for domestic violence."
"Stop lying about your age to get on tinder, firstly. 

And never meet this guy. He's going to screw with your head, or worse. "
After 3 years he should have introduced you to his family to show that he's serious about you. The fact that he also rarely invites you to his house shows that he's not really carving out a place for you in his life either. Nothing he's done shows that he wants to make a lifetime commitment to you. The only thing you have in terms of commitment are vague promises with no timeline and absolutely no action to back them up.
"Okay, as a woman who just gave birth last week, let me break this down for you. By replacing a loving nickname that identifies her as your partner with one that solely mentions her size during an uncomfortable period, she basically heard her husband start and end his day by calling her fat. And no pregnant woman wants to just be identified by her pregnant status anyway. She still wants to be the sexy wife you fell in love with. I realize that wasn't your intention, but that's really irrelevant at this point. "
"Yeah, cuz you've spent your entire relationship as a caretaker instead of a boyfriend. You'll get tired of being her dad someday."
"Probably people who are hung up on the technicality of ""But they were broken up! He can do whatever he wants as a single guy!""

Yeah, I used that technicality once when I was a young, immature jerk. Then I grew up and realized it was bullshit.

Granted in this case it probably worked out for the best. Jerk showed his true colors and expedited the nuking of relationship from orbit."
"Oh honey... Cant you see why she doesn't believe you when you tell her there's nothing she could have done that would warrant this behaviour?

Because YOU don't even believe it. 

Go on and tell us all about how you were a mouthy little shit who deserved a smack more often than not. Tell your sister all about it. And then try to tell her that she's just magically not a mouthy little shit looking to get a beating. 

What you are telling your sister is either true or not. People either have a duty to control themselves and walk away from situations they find provocative and are morally and legally responsible for failing to do so and hurting someone... Or they're not. They can just not bother and lose their cool and flail around like assholes and hurt people and those people should ""know better"" /s. 

If its good for the goose its good for the gander cuts *both ways*. Every time you say you earned your licks you're telling her she's earned hers."
"More like ""I single-handedly destroyed my father and stepmother's relationship with my entire family because I'm a delusional liar and brat. Wat do?"""
"Tell him how amazingly inappropriate and hurtful it is. Makes my skin crawl.

Tell him you don't enjoy being fetishised.

If he gets volatile about it, you know where you stand with him. If he tries to say something about how it's normal where he comes from, this Dane right here can tell you it certainly isn't.

Word of caution: Unless he is mentally challenged, he can't not know how bad it is. He knows. He does it anyway. You need to have your eyes open about this."
"&gt;It's a bit alarming that you had to go talk to everyone else in his life like you are on a spy mission.

I'd be alarmed if she saw him talking to a coworker and flipped her shit like this - I'd say she's possessive and insecure and crazy.  But that's not what she saw - she saw him going out without telling, talking to a young girl, and, most importantly, giving her money.  That's enough to justify ""spying"" on someone, at least in my mind."
"When used against prisoners, sleep deprivation is considered torture.  A parent involving a minor child in their sex life to the degree your mother is is highly inappropriate.  You have a right to a good night's sleep in your own home and if your mother is incapable of being a halfway decent parent, tell your father."
"&gt; I caused my bf to get hurt

You did not. A racist, violence asshole hurt your boyfriend. You and your boyfriend did nothing wrong.

It sounds like B is seriously unhinged."
"Letter being composed, Yelp, and google are being pursued right now."
"I'm glad that i'm not the only person who highlighted that he called OP ""crazy"" for her asking if he cheated on her. This is practically the ""go to"" word in the Cheater's Handbook.

Instead of ""hanging out"" with another female co-worker, he should have been making the extra effort to comfort you in your difficult period.

Right now he's trying to save your relationship with his crying and apologies. Don't fall for crocodile tears."
I hope you've already done this but CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD NOW.
First rule of relationships: no Nazis. 
"Then Dad can explain why it's more important for him to be with his parents and not his kids on Christmas.

Hell, maybe that alone would open his eyes."
"When I'm talking to myself in the mornings (habit of not being fully awake but still having to get up and do stuff) I say horrible things to John and about how I hate him and I don't want to see him ever again. 

My boyfriend's name is not John. I have no idea who John is.  I'm just not a morning person.

Your guy is being ridiculous. You were asleep. No one is responsible for what they dream. "
Nip nops. I fuckin' lol'd.
you're not overreacting. i consider this cheating.
"He has a right to not like fake eyelashes, but he doesn't have a right to bully you into not wearing them. This isn't *just* about the fake eyelashes this is about him controlling your appearance. It's important to not put up with this behavior because things like this are generally bellwethers for abuse. Once he establishes that you're willing to submit to him controlling your appearance he'll start controlling other aspects of your life as well.

This is a red flag. Try to talk to him but if he blames you or insists that he as a right to tell you how to dress or wear makeup - get out. "
"Yeah it's also weird that her weight is what he was thinking of, not how it's nice she's still with her HS boyfriend and wondering how they made it work, being happy for her, what she's been doing in the last few years etc, he was literally thinking, ergh, she got fat, why would her BF stick around for THAT? It just says something about the kind of person he is, and I'm guessing it's not the kind of person you imagined yourself being with. You want someone who will love you and stay with you through thick and thin (literally!) and not have to worry that if something happens, like you get in accident and lose a leg or get sick and have to take steroids that make you puff up or any of a million other things that can happen to a person, that your BF might just leave you because you no longer fit into his physical preference."
Not to mention he still had this girls number and was still friends with her on FB. There's a lot of nails here...
There's nothing inherently wrong about simply telling the truth
"double reason why you need to pack the kid and get out.  Don't repeat.

It's not your job to fix his temper, it's his job."
"&gt; You may want to discuss this with your dad.

Would definitely discuss with your dad....Do you have a friend or relative that also lives close enough by that you could stay with them until the end of school?"
"I can only answer for myself:

I would not even be friends with such a person.

Thai prostitutes are very very high risk of being trafficked sex slaves. There is no way he doesn't know this. That means he willingly risked being a rapist just to get his  dick wet.

Downvoting this won't make it any less true."
"I'm very confused by the behavior as well... I feel like something is left out of this story. Are you sure there wasn't any conversation you had suggesting to hand over the tickets? I doubt it, because you clearly expressed how big this meant to yourself and mom...

Either ways, the guy called you a cunt, in public, after two months of dating, then left you to get an Uber, over Theater tickets... You really want to see the next blow up two months later?"
Not to mentioning adding stress to their son's marriage to a woman they don't care for. 
"Im married, and I'd be okay with fantasy. Pictures, fine. *One* fanfic, maybe (unless he was actually publishing them I might be a little more accepting? I'm not sure). The nude photos... No. I'm not opposed to him looking at nudes or porn, but the way they were obtained... If he loves her as an actress, he must know how disrespected she felt when that happened, and he still has them. That's gross to me.

The recordings would be way too far for me, and those combined with the fact that he's saving hacked photos that invaded a woman's privacy (a fact that he knows), I couldn't deal with it. I'd never see him the same way again."
"YES! very good idea.. ""I wasn't exposing myself .. They were peeping!""
"
"Well, he can just make one up and put an asterisk next to it. Seriously, there is no ""compromise"". You realize the request is not rational. The stress of planning the wedding may be triggering his symptoms. He needs to discuss in therapy, possibly a topic you can discuss together with his therapist."
"Well, in a way you are forcing him to be an adult first and their child second. If he continues to value their time and attention over your kids and you, perhaps you need to spell out the implications of that.

This boy (no matter his physical age, he acts like someone who never went through his rebellious teens) needs a rude awakening."
"You are not owed their forgiveness. Actions, even actions taken in sickness or under the influence, have consequences. One of those consequences might be the loss of your family. "
"No no no no no no no no no no no.


tl;dr  no"
"&gt; That usually has to do with a resulting feeling of ineptitude

I'd be lying if I said I hate to break this to you, but you made shitty coffee for two weeks.  Ineptitude is a pretty solid fit here."
"OP I am replying directly to you to address your concerns about your sexuality coming from all of this. I am a bisexual woman, and I grew up Catholic. I didn't know what bisexuality was until I was about 16. I did know before that age that I was attracted to girls too. What kind of porn has he been forcing you to watch? Are you sure it's not just the act of sex that has you getting turned on (a normal, human reaction) and not the girls in porn? If you're not attracted to girls on a day-to-day basis outside of porn, I wouldn't necessarily label you as bi. I mean, it sounds like he is putting MAJOR pressure on you in this regard - likely to try to convince you into a threesome where he likely gets to fuck this other girl too. Because, hey, you fucked her so now he should get to as well, right? I don't think you need to question your sexuality based on this warped, manipulative relationship you've found yourself in. 


P.S. I totally agree with all the other commenters about your boyfriend being a creep and you needing to get away from him ASAP. You should also maybe spend some time to yourself healing from these wounds."
"&gt; She's never really been in a relationship past 3 months 

At age 26, and given what her family said, that's a pretty clear case of ""it's not you, it's me."" "
"I don't need to be told that I have thin skin. I've dealt with worse than him before, and IMO the thin-skinned response would be to just obey whatever he says and have a miserable time. I'm aware he's always going to be around probably and that there's a level of BS I'm gonna have to put up with but I DONT have to take it non stop for a week."
"Your mom needs to grow up. She, as a mother, should know that a 25 year old woman is a very different person than an angsty teen. She also shouldn't have read your diary. 

All teenagers write ""I hate my parents/life/etc"" in their diaries, lets be real. She of all people should know that. I think it's really weird and manipulative that she's trying to guilt you over it writings you did as a child. "
"&gt; My dad is older, he just wants us to be together and one happy family like when we were kids.

Repeat after me: *you were never one happy family*.

**You carry permanent injuries inflicted by your brother**. It sounds like *he came close to killing you*, and your parents did nothing to stop it, or prevent it from happening again. In fact, they *blamed you* for him seriously injuring you.

That's not one happy family. 

Just like when you were younger, your father wants you to *continue to put up with Austin's abuse* just to make *his own life* easier, so that he doesn't have to confront the reality that Austin is an out-of-control physical abuser, and that he (your dad) is incapable of (or unwilling to) defend his family from the abuse.

Fuck him.

Protect yourself, cut your brother out of your life, permanently. 

If at some time you want to attempt some degree of relationship with your parents (or just your mother), take it slowly, and start to form your own boundaries and conditions for what works for you, instead of just conforming to familial expectations. 

Make sure they know you are deadly serious, and that keeping your brother away from you is a deal-breaker, and that you are willing, for your own safety, to cut them out too, if they ever try to put you in the same room together. "
"Hey, this has nothing to do with your autism. *This is not your fault. None of it.* ""I talked back! I was mean!"" No. Not your fault. There is **nothing** you could say that would justify your brother BREAKING YOUR BONES MULTIPLE TIMES and your family covering for him.

What this does have to do with: you were raised by a very, very abusive family. They abused you mentally, emotionally, and physically. Not just your brother. Your parents. They didn't protect you. They allowed you to be hurt over and over and over. They prioritized your brother over you, despite every indication that your brother is an awful person. Your father is not a good man. He's a failure as a father and as a human. 

Cut them out. All of them. They are still abusing you. They won't ever stop, so you need to not ever see, talk to them, or listen to them again. Go to therapy. Build a new family with your husband. Be happy and never talk to any of your birth family again."
"response to this:  ""fuck off""

back to swiping right and finding someone who isn't an asshole."
"Listen to your lawyer and your wealth manager. *Stop giving away your fucking money!* This was provided for your future, and you're being disrespectful to the memory of the deceased by giving it all away. Just stop. Cut contact with anyone who asks you for money. Being rich can be very fucking lonely. They don't tell you that on TV. "
"Hey man, I know your aren't in a great place right now, so can't fault you for how you are feeling.

*That said,* they are not pathological liars for not admitting an affair that happened nearly a decade ago, they are just good liars with one specific lie.

And believe me, there is a world of difference between lying about a single cheating incident and lying about an ongoing affair. **It does not excuse it,** but there are major differences which will likely influence you going forward.

If it was the one time, so long ago, they may not harbor any feeling for each other and likely never speak about it, finding it easier to pretend it never happened. You can't really do that with an ongoing affair, it takes effort to keep that lie going, with this they could simply pretend it never happened even in their own heads.

It doesn't change that it happened, and they lied to you, but it isn't the same as an ongoing affair. It's up to you if that makes a difference to you if you will forgive them. Just keep in mind it is likely at this point they wish it had never happened too and we're hoping it was dead and buried in the past."
Tread carefully and do not provide any financial assistance. You spent years trying to prove yourself to them to no avail until now. You're right to have your suspicions.
"Even if it is the ex who texted OP, what would he gain if she did respond?  

Say u/exdrama0606 sends a single text back, something along the lines of, ""If you're reaching out to me like this, then you already have a gut feeling that he's not a good person.  Your instincts are good. Trust them."" And then doesn't respond any further, then even if it is the ex, what has he gained?  Confirmation that she still doesn't like him?  Okay.  Confirmation that the phone number he already knew was hers is, in fact, still hers?  I don't see what he can do with that, that he can't already do.

I just don't see where OP would be taking any real risks here.  And what if the person is exactly who she claims?  What if OP can help her decide to get out and save herself?  I just think it would be worth it. 
"
"What a bizarre story...  I'd just block her on social media.  Not much more you can do.  

Did I read that right that your sisters BF broke up with her because she started losing her hair to chemo???  Is he the devil incarnate?  "
Also think about how not planning to be a single mom will affect the child. Single motherhood is unfortunately correlated with a large number of negative outcomes for children.
"I let him complain, I don't take that shit from a grown man. We have a semi-set lunch&amp;dinner times and we somehow manage to do chores/cooking equally, but if he is suddenly craving something at an odd time he can either suffer or get off his ass. I try to not be an enabler of his childishness."
"You aren't being honest with Carol. You haven't told her you were annoyed with her applying for the same job, even when she asked. How do you propose to ""convey don't ever fuck me over like that again"" if you aren't even honest with her when she asks? If you want to get the message across, you need to start communicating better and being straight-up about how you feel. "
"My guess is that your FIL already had this conversation with his son and his son ignored him.  So your FIL decided to pressure you.  You need to tell your fiancé.  And now that you know your FIL has a manipulative streak, you need to be very conscious of making a unified front with your fiancé so that his parents don't succeed the next time they try to divide and conquer you.  

But let your fiancé get mad at his parents rather than you getting mad at this point.  

As for your relationship with his parents - you might actually make a goodwill gesture in the relatively near future.  A person tends to dislike another person if they think that other person dislikes them.  So now that your inlaws have insulted you, they might assume that you hate them and give up on having a good relationship with you.  Inviting them to something (maybe something like a movie where you don't have to talk much) or giving them a gift or doing something else to reach out might do a lot of good for your long-term relationship with them.  They might still treat you badly, and that point you'd need to cut back contact with them, but letting your fiancé deal with the inappropriate questioning of your marriage, and then you reaching out with a kind gesture, could do a lot to set your relationship with them on a good path.  Worth trying anyway.  But probably don't interact with them without your fiancé until they rebuild trust.  "
"&gt; It was really clear from talking to Ben that she didn’t understand she was taking out a loan, as even he thought it was his loan

So now he doesn't want to pay it? That's fucked up. If she was taking the loan out with the understanding that he pays it, he needs to stick to his word.

&gt; He said he planned on paying her back, but I explained that it might not be possible for him to do that and what he loses by it not being under his name (i.e. not being rolled in with his other loans, loan forgiveness, income-driven repayment, etc.).

I did the exact same thing and am paying off a PLUS loan my dad took out because he got a better rate. I just pay the payment each month. You can make a payment on someone else's loan, but any income driven repayment would be based on her income, not his. 

She sounds like she's not very nice, how she treated you was cruel, but that doesn't relieve your bf of his obligations. Your word is your word. "
"Yeah, it seems to me like OP just doesn't want to go to the wedding regardless of where it is and when he was informed of it. "
"You want an explanation, but could any explanation that they give you feel like anything but an excuse? Is there literally anything these people can say to you that is in any way going to ease the pain that you feel and the damage that they did to your life? 

Be selfish. Think about you, think about your little girl. You're the only people who matter right now. Are you going to get anything from being in contact with them that's going to be a positive for you? What could they possibly offer you?

Do you really want to open this can of worms?

I was abused. I'm pretty open about that around these parts. And I know what you're feeling right now. The absolute panic. How the life you have feels fake and you look in a mirror and you're expecting to see the kid you were looking out at you. The incandescent fury combined with shaking hands and that tight feeling in your throat. 

You're happy. You have your partner. You have a wonderful little girl. You have a good job, and you have a good life.

And they don't have an explanation for you, because there isn't one. There just... isn't. They were bad people. They took advantage of you because you were there and they could get something out of you by doing it. That's the truest explanation you'll ever get. "
"Contact the original adoption agency if at all possible, they should be able to help you out and possibly even send someone to your house. When she comes back, tell her this.
""Hello, Girl'sName. I spoke to my wife, and we decided that we are not interested in having a relationship with you. Please do not take this personally, as we are not basing this decision on how we feel about you personally but rather where we are in our lives and how my wife feels about her pregnancy and the adoption. We wish you the best in life, but ask that you not contact us or any members of our immediate or extended family again."""
"I...I think he's getting off to ""owning"" her (I.e. Supporting her 100% financially)"
"&gt; it doesn't sound like this guy is some serial rapist creep


I'm intrigued....how rapey does someone have to be before you think it's a problem?"
"He's wasting your time; and him insisting that *he* is the one who proposes was a way to avoid you forcing the issue prematurely.

He says he isn't ready, and maybe he sincerely isn't, but when will he be? And, more importantly, will he be ready for *you*?"
She is trying to use the excuse that only reason she doesn't cheat on you is because she is on meds?  That excuse is up there with someone claiming they only cheated because they got drunk.
"Really OP. I know ""dump him"" may seem extreme for annoying comments, but the reality is that he's an unrepentant asshole. There's zero likelihood of his behavior ever changing, so if you stay with him you're in for jackass comments and feeling terrible about yourself forever. I can't imagine that's what you want. "
"So OP, two years ago I cut off all my hair because of a promise I had made. All in all, I lost about 20 inches of hair. I  *hated* having short hair and I would have *still* been offended if someone printed off numerous forum posts about growing my hair out. 

Your boyfriend is allowed to not like your new haircut. It's even understandable if he's not attracted to you with short hair because people like different things. It's not okay for him to be rude about it or immediately assume you'll start taking supplements to grow it back out to the length *he* likes. 

It's definitely time for a serious talk. You need to talk to him about how shitty his actions made you feel and you need to discuss if he wants to be with you or if he isn't attracted to you anymore. In general, pressuring someone to change themselves to suit your tastes is a shitty move and needs to be addressed. "
"Seconding this. You should definitely opt to call the police about this rather than go over. It could be a lure, and right now you have to worry about your safety more. "
"Nope because when asked to clarify, she said

&gt; It's nothing that black and white...more like he does things he knows I dislike in a way that's just about him getting off, **and I don't really feel able to say no when he's that angry.**"
"Do a step up, go to someplace like Starbucks that you pay ahead for your drink. "
"Well, you are right - you can't go back now, so only time to go forward. You're going to have to work very very hard to find some self love but it's not impossible. 

There was a girl in some of my classes in university who's arms were **covered**, I mean **riddled** in scars, I never saw her legs but I imagine they were the same - worst self harm scars I've ever seen. She just owned it. I never really talked to her about it but I'm certain she just kind of accepted it as a part of her life and moved on. She also had a fabulous wedding during the time I knew her and her photos looked amazing :) 

 People are going to give you weird looks, or stare, but fuck it - don't care about those people. Be a spokesperson for NOT cutting and find a way to use others ""questions"" as a way to talk about mental health and finding the positive. The only way up from here is to look at things from a different perspective. Also, I'd be pretty surprised if you couldn't find *someone* to tattoo you, might cost you a pretty penny but I'm positive there's an artist out there that could manage it. 

As for dating, perhaps wear clothes that cover you at first and vet people out on the first/third date (whatever you're emotionally capable of) by explaining the situation to them - not everybody is going to be OK with it, but that's OK....you will find someone who is!"
"I mean... There's a reason he doesn't want to tell her everything when she tells ""everything"" to a person he specifically asked her not to. On top of that she had his mom call him while she sat there and listened?? There's no trust in this relationship... On either end apparently."
"Your husband is 300 lbs and you are five months pregnant. It doesn't matter who started what. You are carrying his child. He saw you fall and doesn't rush over to pick you up? Not to mention he pushed you to make you fall. Even if he did that lightly, your well-being should be a priority.

Stop engaging with the in-laws, especially your MIL. She is clearly on her son's side no matter what. Also, this reads like she never liked you anyway so of course it's your fault. Stop with the texts. Stop justifying yourself to people who are not on your side. "
Install security cameras that would capture someone looking though your windows. 
"You know what, that's a good idea.

He's been a fantastically good friend to me for a really long time (main reason why this is so heartbreaking), if I can get him talking properly I might reach some form of a resolution."
"&gt; She betrayed her fellow women

Okay, she did something really wrong, but this bothers me. Women are not all in league with each other. We're not obligated to each other because we share a gender."
"That's my line of thought too, I'm not upset about it though and I wish her the best in the future. "
"Just one possible clarification.  I think that when your mom said that you're out of state, she wasn't talking about why she wasn't helping financially.  She was talking about why she wasn't helping you pick venues and stuff like that."
"It's easy - this girl got everything she ever wanted. Her mom sacrifices so that she can keep up with the rich kids - not just the regular kids. This isn't one of those situations where a kid sees their parents struggling just to be able to give their kids a present, or ANYTHING at Christmas or for their birthday, and thinks ""Wow, my mom really worked hard to give me that. I'm so grateful"". She'll probably get some perspective when she's older, but right now she's a bratty teenage girl and trust me, they suck! I feel like OP probably tried to ""keep up"" so much, and keep her struggles private, on top of not giving her child boundaries in order to compensate for her daughter not having a daddy. 

Luckily, OP, it's not too late to enforce boundaries but it's going to be really, really hard. Like others have said, you need to be her mom, not her friend. "
"So he's not paying you rent...he's not buying food...he goes to work and basically only makes enough to pay for the gas and back?

I'd consider this a lost cause. Heads up to your hubby...jut because you knew a guy when he was a kid doesn't meant you know him as an adult."
"Only bring two or three people with you. It is going to be the only way to avoid really hurting someone's feelings and causing a rift in your group.

Also, in the future, don't ever choose to leave someone out based on them causing the least amount of drama. That's the people that you most want around you"
"Saying that sort of stuff while getting stuck in traffic once is weird.  As someone who lives in LA and is stuck in traffic every day, I can completely relate.  ""Someone better be dead"" or ""this world needs another plague"" is a thought ive shared with my girlfriend multiple times without issue.

That being said, he isnt wishing someone would die.  Its just a way to blow off steam.  Sometimes when you are stuck in a car for that long, you just need to rant.  If I did a tiny fraction of the things I've said off hand in my car, I'd be executed.  He doesnt need ""anger counseling"" because there is nothing wrong with him that isnt shared with many commuters. He is literally upset stupid people kept him from seeing you."
"God if somebody was afraid of my very not agressive dog and would not move in because of it, that would be a deal breaker, I would never re-home him for a relationship."
"One of my first calls during my FT was for a guy who got caught in a sudden downpour while riding home from work. He skidded out and slid along the highway for about 10 meters then landed in a nice pile of leaves. He was fine, but his helmet had been sanded down almost all the way- only the slightest fraction of an inch remained between his skull and the road, and there was even a tiny hole with some hair poking out. No dramatic collision, only one broken bone... but had his helmet been off, it would have been his skull that was ground down on the asphalt. It blew his mind to see how close he had come. "
"$4 million at 5% a year is $200,000 per year.  He already has a house and car--very little expenses.  He could easily never work again for the rest of his life."
Sounds like a nice date.  Is your gf not cool with you dating other girls?
"Oh, come *on*. An 18 year old is old enough to know not to spy on someone in the shower. *He* might feel betrayed? He shouldn't be a pervert its pretty easy not to be. So what if he ends up addicted? Its his own dang fault. He's a legal adult. 

I am so freaking sick of this always being preached on reddit. If you're not some sexual deviant, you're lying and should always be forgiving to blasted everything. Because its their 'sexuality', and that excuses everything.

Actions have consequences. Don't like them, don't do the stupid action."
"Yes - also, it doesn't even seem like it is *just* a BDSM thing (which still wouldn't be ok) - he's taking pictures of random women and captioning them with the n word, texting her and calling her this in the middle of the day, etc. I get the impression he just likes talking about black women this way and loves that being with a black women, and calling it race play, gives him an ""excuse"" to do it. He's vile."

"&gt; a dude who I consider one of my best friends was horsing around in my car

Was it just him ""horsing around"" or were you ""horsing around"" together?

If I was play wrestling with someone or we were playing charlie horse or something (for the life of me I can't imagine what constitutes a near-30-year-old horsing around in a car), I would probably not ask someone to pay for something we broke, even if he actually hit it. In other words, did you participate in the sequence of events leading to it getting broken or was it all him?

If it was all him, he's being an ass, and he's not much of a friend--that sucks. If it was mutual, it *is* kind of ambiguous."
"Dude, a child feeling like they are not the center of the world anymore is A GOOD THING. We all have to share in this earth, in the air we breathe, and yes, some of us, our parents!

"You do realize ur treating your son like shit and his mom is right that you are the evil spouse.


You dont want to be a dad to him right now cause ur too busy fucking the girl 10 years younger than you who 
went from being 25 to 35 in a few weeks.


Once you pump a kid into her, then u will make sure she co-parents your son while you beat off fantasizing about your sons cool room.


Seriously, do you think your son doesnt realize how you treat him like an inconvenience? "
"Isn't it funny how her not trusting you suddenly opened your eyes to realize that you shouldn't be trusting her? 

Yeah dude, her actions are a major red flag at this point. And the trust is ruined, because later if she does show you her phone, it will only be after she's sterilized it of whatever she wanted to keep you from seeing.

She's either doing something inappropriate or she chose the dumbest way to end an otherwise good relationship."
"This is not really for you to explain. Your husband needs to explain this to Stefanie, not you, since it was his parents that pulled this stunt. Then your husband needs to tell his parents to stop this bullshit. It's disrespectful to the family. 

Stefanie needs to understand that she has to prioritize family over her immediate needs, and that the gift was designed to drive your family apart. Hopefully when she understands that the gift was designed to manipulate her into picking a car over family, she'll understand."
"These people sound mentally ill.  She threw you under the bus to appease a guy; this strikes me as low-character.  What does her father think of all this?  If I were him, I might ask her what the hell is she thinking?    "
"Do you think that maybe it is because he has come to numb himself to his feelings about his parents and he is afraid to let himself feel? I honestly feel as if your parents were serious when they said that they will not forgive themselves if they found out that their son was alive. I also feel that if your brother tells them that he forgives them, then they will find it in them to forgive themselves. I also sincerely believe that, given a choice, your parents would rather meet their son, even if he isn't enthusiastic about meeting them.

At the moment, it appears as if your brother is ambivalent towards meeting your parents. He has lived without them for so long that he has learned to cut himself off from wanting to be with his parents. Give your brother time to acclimatize to the idea that his family is still around and keep in contact with him. If anyone can help your parents heal and move past from the guilt, then it is your brother."

"I can't get over the part of your post where you mentioned he was trying to change the way you dress and even wanted you to read up on China's history. The style of clothes we wear are part of our identity. Also, reading a book won't change the way you look. I would have found that highly offensive. The fact he is out with the type of female he tries to change you into would be the last straw. I may not be level headed sometimes but I really don't think I would even listen to him when get gets back. I would actually probably not even be there when he gets back. "
"Explaining to your mutual friends is easy. You've just done it here. ""So Matt's been acting off since I started dating [Boyfriend], and he's moved from telling me how he thinks I need to get more friends, to making snide little jokes. Can you not play along when he does?"" 

Don't let his little comments pass. Good phrases to respond with are:

""Why would you think that was an okay thing to say?""

""Did you really think that was an acceptable remark?""

""Matt, do you really think it's appropriate to badmouth someone to their face? Because you should know, it's not.""

""You know it's not a joke if only you think it's funny, right?""

""Insult, comedy, not actually the same thing.""

Or, when he says something, staring at him like, ""...wow, what did you just say"", then going, ""Okay, changing the subject to something that's atually funny/interesting/not Matt insulting me...""

if you have good friends in the group, find one and say, ""so Matt's got this habit of saying hurtful things about me. It's been happening since I met [Boyfriend]. Can you step in when he says something? Because he's really starting to embarrass himself.

This is the thing: he knows exactly what he's doing. He's getting away with it, because he's really on you behaving better than him and acting like his behaviour isn't as bad as it is-- on your treating it like you don't know he's doing it deliberately (the way you might politely overlook if someone accidentally says something rude without meaning to, so they don't feel bad about it). Pointing it out kindly is pointless, because he's doing it explicitly to hurt you.

The good news is: when someone is no longer abiding by the social contract, you don't have to stick with it wrt them either. Call him out on it, consistently. Make it clear that you think he's embarrassing himself. ""Matt, you know this is the fifth time you've talked about that? Do you really think I'm that interesting?""

If he ignores you, as long as it doesn't interfere with work? That's a win. You don't want his attenion. If he ignores you and it does intefere with work, call him on it-- ""Matt, have you done X? Matt, I did say I couldn't get to that meeting and we need to reschedule.""

"She's intested in an upgrade.  If you want to date her until something better comes along it is probably fine but don't invest emotionally beyond this point, you are temporary to her."
I have to agree with your sister. My parents have tons of nekkid photos of me as a kid. I highly doubt anyone would say that it is child porn. Porn is sexualization of a minor not naked family photos. It would be reaching for someone to charge those photos as child pornography.
"Stop going on fake dates with her, cuddling with her etc. Since you have feelings for her, it isn't fair to you and you can easily put yourself in a position to be taken advantage of emotionally. 

I have no idea what's going on, but you either need to ask her out or start making some distance in the friendship. So I would just tell her you are interested in her romantically and ask her out on a real date. "
"So let me get this straight: your parents, upon you coming clean, held you down and beat you with a belt.

No wonder you lied to them when you were younger. Growing up in a household like this, lying is a survival skill when random physical violence is the other option. 

Go to the police. Make a report. It's not your job to gather evidence--it's theirs. Get out. Get away from this. They are trying to destroy you, just like they tried to destroy your brother. Don't let them."
I guess it's possible. I almost thought she was getting off on the idea of me cheating on her because she brings it up so often but that's another possibility. 
"You've been nice and given her time to get out, now its time to enforce it.  She clearly is using the game as emotional escapism and honestly that guy in Phoenix is probably a component of it.  A big red flag is how she took off work to pack but ended up playing her game all day instead, so she's clearly not making responsible decisions and at 28 that's very concerning. Call it emotional cheating, video game addiction, maybe a little of both, whatever it is you're better off without this one. "
"But she had already proved that she couldn't be trusted with sensitive information about someone else. He was not wrong to not trust her with this. And she describes that they had a fight about him not wanting her to have a relationship with his mother, but she pushed back. Sharing abusive details can be very, very difficult, especially since it sounded like his abuse was severe. He told her his childhood was ""rough and dark"" and that he didn't want to have a relationship with his mother. I don't think he needed to tell her one more thing to have her listen to him. "

"Okay, so let's break this down and see if there is a deal-breaker anywhere...

1) sometime in the past, specifics unknown, he meets and befriends a stripper, exchanging numbers and FB ""friending""

2) he invites said stripper to his house and fucks her in multiple ways/times and films it all for posterity, aka to jerk to later

3) apparently he is so consumed with guilt over this action, that he pulls away from you, rejecting you sexually, causing a rough patch in your otherwise good relationship, with zero explanations for his behavior

4) *note -  does he later claim in his confession that a rough patch in your relationship caused him to call her over instead of the other way around or did I read it wrong?

5) he continues to jerk it to said pictures even though he is oh-so distraught over his infidelity, to the point to copying them to his phone so that he can have them with him constantly

6) at some time, in the recent past, he finally deletes the pictures from the phone, but because he is a stupid criminal, he doesn't delete the corresponding ""deleted pictures"" roll as well

7) he carries on a relationship with you, selfishly, while exposing you to to STI/STDs at least once (but probably more since he remained in contact with her and wasn't apparently all that bent up about it if he jerked it on the regular to the memories), not giving you the ability to make an informed decision about whether to stay with a cheater or not 

8) he never planned on telling you, ever, and only discontinued contact with her because he was caught

I don't know. Are there any deal-breakers in there for you? He selfishly sought sex with another woman outside of your relationship just because and selfishly kept it to himself, using it over and over again as a means for self-pleasure, and now is trying to woo you back with sweet nothings and romance. Why were you never thought of when he befriended her, when he called her over, when his dick was in her mouth, when he fucked her on the same bed he does you, and later when he jacked it to thoughts of her for 12 months?


Me? I'd be out in a flash. I am worth more than that. Are you?

Y person was rude, used personal attacks, and overall had appallingly unprofessional behavior.

I hope that Y person will be reprimanded, or at the least you can file this report in Y person's file, so that if future interviewees report similar experiences there will be more weight to my observations. Please contact me if you have questions or would like further information about Y person's behavior.""

Yeah he loves him because he is family, but he could go years without speaking to him and be perfectly fine with that. Early bonding is important, and you are missing out on getting to know your baby daughter as she becomes a little person. "
"Hi OP. My ex BF was like this. ""Hated"" his ""unreasonable and nitpicky"" mother. But still asked ""how high"" when she said jump.

The end of it for me was when my older cat got hurt. He has arthritis, and landed a jump badly or didn't land at all. He came out of the bathroom unable to walk. Thankfully nothing was broken, it was just a severe sprain, but I asked him to 1) keep the bathroom door shut, and 2) not be gone too TOO long while I was at work for the first couple days. He couldn't walk *at all* and needed to be carried to the litter and to food and water. He agreed. He's always loved my cats. 

Except I came home at *11 pm* and he wasn't there. Poor hurt kitty had peed and pooped on himself and his bed. The water dish was dry. He hasn't been given his pain meds. The bathroom door was open and while he wasn't able to get up and go in there, we needed to *get into the habit* of closing it. I had left for work at 2, btw.

I called him up LIVID and asked where he was.

Yep, he was at mom's. She had ordered a new TV and wanted him to hook it up. Then she wanted him to stay for dinner. He had brought laundry and was waiting for it to finish. He had left at 4 PM. 

Look, I know the world doesn't revolve around an injured cat. He would have been fine for *a couple hours*. But hoooooooo no. MOMMY wanted something. We can't say no to MOMMY. Mommy is 85, we don't know how much longer Mommy has. 

Well point of fact, we don't know how much longer any of us have. I could die in a car crash on the way home tonight, I had a friend die of a stroke at 37 years old. Other point of fact, Injured Kitty is 16, which is the equivalent of 84 in human years. We don't know how much longer HE has.

What this behavior said to me, and should say to you, OP, is Mommy will always be more important. What if it had been me who couldn't walk? Me who needed help to the toilet? Me who needed medicine? Better hope Mommy doesn't need anything. It also said what's important to me isn't important to him. Even if he had hated my cat, if he cared for me he should have told Mommy ""I'll hook up the TV, but I'll need a raincheck for dinner. GFs cat is hurt and I can't stay away long."" Any reasonable person would understand that.

The ending: I got kitty cleaned up, and told then-ex to stay at Mom's. Permanently. Kitty made an 85% recovery, he will probably always walk with a slight limp but it doesn't seem to bother him. Vet said soft tissue trauma takes a life age to heal, and in a senior, sometimes it never heals completely. He doesn't appear to be in pain, and does everything he used to, minus jumping off the vanity. Ex now lives with his mom. "
"By saying ""normal"" repetitively to every question, you're basically telling him ""I don't want to talk to you."" To a westerner, that's a near-comical way of blowing someone off. Did you mean to be funny, or did you just want him to stop asking you those questions? Because either way, you probably came off either strange or a little rude. Now he thinks you don't want him talking to you. 

The best thing you could have done (instead of saying ""normal"", which sounds like you're a robot or you want to escape) would be to say ""Hey, I'm not used to answering questions like that. I don't mind talking to you but our cultures are pretty different that way!"" Either that, or you do what everybody else does and give a short but friendly response to the question and begin your conversation. If someone asks how you are, they're not interested in knowing the deep subtleties running through your head. All you say is ""good thanks!"" and then talk about anything you want.

""How are you?""

""Good, thanks! I saw that movie we were talking about the other day.""

""Really? How did you like it?""

Etc, etc. Honestly it's just a cultural difference, lots of people are probably going to act the same way. You can explain that it makes you uncomfortable or just adapt, whichever seems easiest to you."

Anyway, you are absolutely correct in how it would feel to Kate if you were to give the same amount of money to Pippa as 'compensation'. 

I know life isn't fair, but it would really bother me and feel very unfair if my parents said to my brother 'since we are paying for Bridgette's eye surgery, we'll pay for you to go the World Cup in 2018' (the thing my brother is currently saving for). I want to go to the World Cup too.......and I'd basically miss out because I was born with shitty eyes, or forced to choose between a life experience I really want and having my eyes fixed when my eyes are so bad it affects my quality of life (and they are still not as bad as Kate's mind you). My brother wouldn't have to make that decision. Yeah. That feels unfair. 

Now, Like you say, life isn't always fair. 

But you don't have to make it even unfairer for Kate. That's not what a parent should do. 

If Pippa gets annoyed her sister is having money spent on her, remind that it is not that she is missing out on something. It's not like Kate is getting a luxury purchase or a holiday, she's getting something Pippa *already has*: the ability to see properly. "

Oh dude. OK. This was inappropriate because you are **roommates**, not because you're some hideous slug-beast or whatever you *think* you are. Please, seek therapy for your self-esteem issues. 

Regarding your roommate, I do think you should apologize, don't get flowers, just the next time you see her, apologize for making your hangout time awkward. There's not much more you can do.

"I see why the ""it's not fair to your friend"" approach seems like a good idea, but I don't think it's the right way to approach this.  For one thing, there's a very good chance Eric will just blow off those concerns.  But more importantly, it sends the message that what YOU want doesn't matter, only what's good for his friend, which is the exact reason you're having this problem in the first place.

Just tell Eric straight-out:  I appreciate you helping me meet new people and your friend seems nice, but I'm just not interested in dating him.  Then DO NOT ENGAGE on that topic any further.  The more you try to explain why you don't want to date his friend, the more he's going to view you talking about it as an invitation to try to talk you into it.  

If he wants to know ""but whyyyyyyyyy won't you give him a chance"" stick to extremely generic, non-informative statements like ""I'm just not interested in dating him.""

And I think you should probably start exploring ways to meet people outside of this group.  Eric isn't showing himself to be a very good friend here, and you don't want to suddenly lose your entire social network if you have a serious falling out with him because of this or anything else."
"I mean...if she wants a ""normal"" life for her son, your friend summed it up well:

You have a boyfriend, who you're going to the banquet with. So when another boy asked you, you turned him down. Part of ""normal"" life is rejection, Jake needs to learn that and be able to cope with it. If anything, everyone *else* is treating him like he's ""not normal"" by expecting you to treat him differently because of his disability."

You say your dad is calculating, doesn't give up and is very persistent on contacting you all. And now he's found a willing respondent and the right message to provoke a reaction. Your father has found the weak point in your defence and I would guess that he will start to apply pressure on it soon. I reckon when you have that talk with your boyfriend you can mention that what he did was open a door for your father into your lives, and what to do when your father comes banging on the door again and again. He's now personally exposed to your father. That might open his eyes a bit. "
"It would take all my power not to warn his next ex-girlfriend.

But seriously, for fuck's sake, date swingers if you're gonna pull that shit."
"So they make excuses to justify abuse just because of your boyfriend's skin color?

That's insane."

"Exactly, sex workers from Thailand are well known for scamming gulible western men, there could be ten guys paying ""child support"" for ""their"" baby - hell, if they are only communicating via email, there may not even be a baby at all....!

Get an STD test, proof there even is a baby, a legit DNA if needed. In that order. This relationship sounds like it may not be salvagable however..."
"Heck, I'd phrase it more as, ""Hey, your dad said something that made me very uncomfortable the other day"".

Don't minimize how this made you feel. Don't try to downplay what is quite likely a serious issue. I wouldn't jump into accusations or anything, but make it clear that this made you uncomfortable and that you don't know what to make of it."

This is why it's a ""husband problem"". We don't hear what the husband's been doing in terms of boundary setting with his parents or working to resolve this. "
"&gt;On another note, she's showing her wants are more important to her than you are. Allergies suck, and I would never bring a known allergen around my SO because making my partner miserable isn't worth ""aww it's so cute!"" 

THIS. My dad had a longtime live-in girlfriend who desperately wanted a French bulldog. I'll admit, those are some adorable damn dogs, but my brother and I both still lived at home and are allergic to most dogs. Well one day we came home and she was holding a French bulldog puppy on her lap and she said ""everyone, this is George!"" to which my father replied ""and where are you and George going to live?"" Moved her out that night.

A lot of people don't understand how severe allergies can be, but those of us who do, need to protect ourselves. You could have a sudden bout of allergy-triggered asthma from this cat, and since you're not prepared, that could kill you. Its fine to be willing to die for your SO, but not because of her selfishness. This would be a total deal-breaker for me and most people with known allergies."
"I'm your age and the idea of my boyfriend (also 20) dating my high school sophomore sister makes me wanna gag. On the street 16 year olds look like babies to me. 

No well adjusted 20 year old guy ought to like that notion. I'm glad you're sane. "
"What's drastic is a parent controlling their 20yo son's bedtime. The reason everyone is suggesting you move out is because your parents are being overly controlling. Your other options are pretty much limited to taking a hard stance and ignoring the bedtime they set for you (which will lead to a lot of arguments), or putting up with it. Moving out is just honestly the best option here, unless you're really okay with constantly arguing or accepting the rule. "
"After watching a bunch of Supernatural episodes in a row, apparently I was talking to ""Dean"" in my sleep. "
"&gt;Every time he's had episodes like this I have just taken it and not kicked up a fuss. I have literally never told him he shouldnt talk to me like that for fear he would think I wasn't supporting him or understanding his issues. 

Re-read this line every time you feel like relenting and continuing the relationship. You can't even stand up for yourself and request that he not call you vile names because that might hurt *his feelings*. 

Keep in mind that while acknowledgement is the first step to recovery, it's only the first. If he goes on and on about how worthless he feels and how he's just an awful drug addict, it's very likely not a cry for help and more likely a manipulation tactic. 

Often when someone is beating themselves up about their behaviour, it is natural for us to try and minimize it to assauge their guilt. It sounds like he is knowingly pushing you to ignore his awful behaviour towards you, and simultaneously avoid dealing with his addictions ."
"I think you need to approach it from a different standpoint.  Instead of saying ""I'm mature enough"" just tell them straight up that you don't like to be treated this way.  Don't even bring your maturity or age into consideration."
"Uh, even if this is just a sexual thing and he's not truly racist, he is massively disrespecting you. You don't like it, you've expressed that to him but he doesn't care as long as he is getting off. 

&gt;whenever I bring it up he ignores me and tells me I am overreacting and that he can't possibly be a racist since he's in love with a black woman. 

""I'm not racist! Some of my best friends are black! Now shut up while I verbally degrade you during sex against your wishes!""

Your boyfriend is disgusting."

"Yeah, pushing someone over changing the radio station is not at all normal. I would reconsider moving in with this person until you are able to find out where this behavior is coming from.

Do you think he is that stressed out? I'd hate to think this is how he reacts when he is stressed. ""Missed out on the promotion at work? Beat my wife. Got into a car accident? Beat my wife."" 

Any reason to suspect drug use?"

"Because he can manipulate you. Some men like to touted that women should be ""naturally beautiful"" but freak if you have leg hair or don't wax your mustache. Women go through great pains to look and feel their best, whatever that may mean. 

Also, someone poking/pulling your falsies. UGH. NO. WHY. 

Some men see vulnerable  young women they can manipulate into changing and that's why they date them.  

Please don't contact this dude again, this is a huge red flag."
"Ew, what? No!  

You sound very detached, which is good-ish, you know? Feel your feelings, though. You're gonna have a lot of feelings. Let them come, feel them fully, and let them go.  

Honestly, this is the wildest possible outcome, really. It's awful now, but in 10 years this will be your back pocket story when someone asks you ""who's the worst boyfriend you ever had?"" People will buy you a goddamn beer for this story, girl."
"You have to go with your gut. You have to do what's best for you. You're absolutely right that you're both very young--and you have no support, and he's got _no idea_ what it actually takes to raise a child (I am pretty sure you'd have to do most of the work).

And here he is, not only ignoring you, running roughshod over your worries, but doing his damnedest to manipulate you into carrying to term.

In your shoes...I personally would go through with the abortion, and then tell him and his parents that I miscarried.  Particularly as you're early enough on to have a medical abortion, that would be simplest. 

Also? I have to say that I fucking _loathe_ this:

&gt;He isn’t religious but he has told me he doesn’t believe in abortion apart from in extreme circumstances. 

Either all abortions are acceptable, or none are. Either all abortions are murder or none are. If in ""extreme circumstances"" such as rape it is acceptable to have an abortion, then in the circumstance of being a pregnant teenager who doesn't want to be a mom so early it mus also be so."
"yeah I reminded him of his comment about how ""stupid"" I was going to look when his friend was ""right"" and I was wrong. He just laughed and called his friend stupid instead. "
why as he reading her texts while she was in the shower? also seems kinda odd to me.
I like your complete lack of reference to the morality of such act.
"Oh, I meant to first tell the truth, then ask for an apology. I think she'd give one, because she doesn't know how much it hurt me. But then again, even if it was unintentional, I don't see how I would be 100% A-Ok with this "
"You say you are from New South Wales, so I assume you are an Aussie citizen. If this the case, you can move to New Zealand without the need of a Visa. Australian citizens are allowed to live and work in New Zealand by simply moving there. Also it has a lower cost of living than Australia. If you delete all social media and have the baby in New Zealand, it will be difficult for her to track you down, much less know about the child. You could go as far as changing your name before you go if you feel you need that added layer of protection. New Zealand does not have these grandparent's rights legislation, so not much she can do there. If you have a grandparent born in the UK you can try applying for a ancestry Visa and move to the UK. You may alternatively qualify for a visa to move and work in Canada."
"It's unfortunate timing. I'm sorry for your ex's loss. That sucks.

You aren't really the ideal person to give him support right now. You know that. That's not selfishness. That's just the situation.

""I'm so sorry to hear about your friend. I cannot be there for you right now but I hope you aren't alone.""

If you know someone in his life that would be in a good position to support him who you don't mind contacting, I suppose you could reach out to them for a heads-up."
"Oh God, same here. As bad as it sounds, I was more worried than anything about this girl losing her Hamilton tickets. I know if my sister's boyfriend tried pulling anything like this that there'd be all hell to pay, so I'm glad OP is dumping him already. "
"Actually, this makes a lot of sense. All that built-up resentment that no one stood up for him while he was letting himself go has led to him taking on the misguided mission of trying to ""save"" everyone else. "
"Jesus christ I feel for that kid, like that is kinda heartbreaking."
"What didn't she tell you upfront? A detailed account of her every sexual act she performed with her ex? I'm curious to know how you even came to speak with the ex about their sexual history.

A lot of girls will perform sex acts that they don't actually enjoy because they are insecure and feel like they have no choice unless they want to be dumped. It isn't necessarily that she did those things to please him, it comes more out of insecurity. You girlfriend is older now and she probably knows what she likes anyway. You are making this all about you when it has nothing to do with you, at least from what you have described. You sound extremely insecure."
"""Yes, you've mentioned that before.""  They'll be embarrassed that you remember that they keep harping about it and will hopefully shut up.

"how will him visiting alone fix your problem ? It seems like hes just putting things under the carpet to avoid it rather than face it. Its been 5 years and he wants to face this at some random time in the future ? 


Nope. I come from a similar tradition where in big gatherings woman eat in a separate room to man with the children, but they don't wait for the man to finish eating to eat the left overs. They have their meal at the same time in a different room. Also if theres a guest coming along - which you are ! they will accommodate you because usually more than anything else they have to be welcoming of their guest (thats a bigger part of their culture!).

TBH, if it comes to it, you might have to tell HIM."
"I told him before when i lost my temper that he became our father and he yelled at me and told me I went to far. Our dad is an awful person who lied to the courts to get them to deny our mother custody and only let us have supervised visitation  with her a couple times a month if she was lucky. He also destroyed  her financially by getting her fired from her job.

Neither of us have spoken to him in over 5 years and his biggest insecurity  (on top of his size) was becoming just like him. "
"This is what really saves it for me. He wasn't doing it for nefarious purposes, continued to be nice to jerks, and he saw that you stuck up for him when others were mean."
"This is the heart of it. Whether or not his expressions of racism are sincere, you've told him you're not comfortable with it, and he needs to respect that.

Also, even if race play isn't sincerely hateful, it does play on cultural taboos that are rooted in racism. The turn on is still rooted in the belief that this is naughty or inappropriate, and that belief is a racist notion. So I absolutely understand your discomfort. It would make me pretty uncomfortable too."
"Do NOT give him any more information about yourself. You don't owe a bus driver an explanation of your MS. I think I'd try just once telling him to stop. So the next time he says ""Wow, nice to see you've finally dressed up!"" I'd say something along the lines of ""You know, I'd really appreciate it if you stopped commenting on my appearance. It makes me uncomfortable."" and then go sit at the back of the bus. He may pout or give you dirty looks, but as long as he stops I'd ignore that. If he continues to make comments, I think you should give the bus company a call. "

Also, it's a picture. A memory. You've presumably been a part of many family memories at this point. I understand where you're coming from in feeling weird about this, but I'd say to just jump in and do it. It's just a picture, and I don't think any of your reasons for wanting to chicken out are particularly solid."
"You have an issue, but it's a boyfriend issue as opposed to a child issue.  You're not her mother, so he needs to be setting boundaries with his child, which he's clearly failing to do.  It's also troubling that he's taking advantage of you as free childcare, and suggesting you have any obligation to watch his daughter when he can easily do it instead.  Unfortunately, I think he's just an apathetic and kind of crummy parent.  You should sit him down and voice your complaints, but I'm not holding my breath that he'll take you seriously or change this behavior, since I think it stems from him lacking a certain  seriousness in how he views fatherhood.  My prediction is that he won't be willing to make any significant changes because he thinks he's entitled to raise his child this way, so you need to decide whether or not that attitude and it's manifestation in his child's misbehavior is a deal breaker for this relationship.  Best of luck in figuring out how you want to proceed."
"Him being drunk wasn't the problem. Violent people often say they just lost control in the moment and you shouldn't hold it against then, but when you really look at their actions they do everything with purpose. 

There was a post here yesterday about a woman breaking up with her abusive BF in public where she realised that he was in complete control every time he had ""lost it"" before because the way he hurt her in public was not the same as the way he hurt her in private.

He hurt you... Very deeply. And while you did what you could for outside appearances, it doesn't seem like you actually healed. You only fixed what was pointed out. Yes you say you did it for yourself and you may feel that you have, but still it was at the result of the shaming of this ex. 
Do you not think this would manifest in otherways? 

You have, whether you intended to or not, created this drama... And more than likely it is bc you are still hurt. There's no shame in that, at all... But letting it create an even bigger issue... Come on.... At 29 do you not have other things that you would like to start focusing on? 

You said that you and Tim are going about your lives normally... That's something i doubt. Case in point this post 
. 
Bottom line? You like that this situation created this drama bc its almost like a weird sense of karma that you feel you got to serve. Only it erupted a little more than expected.

"Your feelings are completely understandable.  

You should communicate your concerns with David.  It would be wise of you both to get couples counseling to help discuss both of your concerns.

If he hasn't already, David needs to get a good Family Lawyer.  Child support of $1000 a month may or may not be reasonable.  David having visitation with Noah every weekend is not necessarily reasonable.  That would have you and David working all week and then caring for Noah every single weekend.  If you live near each other, a schedule splitting custody/visitation on a weekly basis (Katy has Noah for a week, David has Noah for a week) might be a more equal split of responsibilities.

If you are unable to accept the changes this makes to your plans for your life, that doesn't make you a terrible person.  It is better to realize, and be honest about, your limitations than to lie and be miserable.  "
"I don't think the length of the relationship matters when they started dating so young. Plus the topic of marriage did come up. I feel like 23 was actually a pretty good age for that to happen, they both had a good idea of what they wanted and realized it didn't mesh. "
"She's only 23 and you've only been dating a year and she's already pulled an ultimatum and started visiting jewelry stores? Yikes, good thing she's made it so easy for you to drop her. She doesn't respect your boundaries, she thinks marriage will improve your relationship and is accusing you of being non-commital.

Guy: No offense sweetheart, but you could stand to lose a little weight. Hey, I’m just being honest! That’s just how I am.

Girl: Oh I see what’s happened.

Guy: Huh?

Girl: You’re using “liar, liar” honesty. That’s when you vocalize every lame excuse for a thought that limps across your mind, even when your opinion is unsolicited, lacks any value, and is downright cruel.

In fact, i’ll bet you enjoy saying cruel things under the guise of honesty, because it gives you an excuse to be mean to people and feel better about your pathetic existence in the process. You’re also under the mistaken belief that because this is “just how you are”, you’re somehow exempt from treating others with civility and respect.

I don’t like to stand on the bus, but I still give up my seat to pregnant women and the elderly, because that’s how it works in polite society: we improve our crappy behavior to make the world a little more pleasant for each other. And when actual adults talk about honesty, it means they’ve chosen not to deceive others for personal gain, because they actually care about the people around them. It doesn’t mean insulting everyone who has the misfortune of entering your field of vision.

The irony of that is your urge to be “honest” makes people less likely to appreciate it when you actually have something of value to say, should that ever happen.

I almost feel sorry for you, but ultimately I don’t because you’re a dillhole, and you’re a dillhole on purpose.

Guy: You didn’t have to be so blunt.

Girl: Hey, I’m just being honest."

you should take one of those jobs for your own sake, unless you're saving the world and getting free all-expenses vacations to the Caribbean as part of your benefits package where you're at right now you can be happy and complacent at another workplace, and among the many nice things money can buy might be some breathing room for your wife to find another job she isn't quite so miserable at.

This is not true.  He's avoiding the issue by not having you there.  He's not actually supporting you.  

&gt;  just because it's always been like that it doesn't mean it's ok

Ask him if he's making waves with his family when he goes around there alone.  I mean, if it's not ok then presumably he's not ok with it anymore, is he?  Is he?

And if you boyfriend is spineless and not prepared to talk to his family about this, this tells you about how he has your back for the long term too."

Is peeping the kind of behaviour you want your son engaging in? If not, you have a duty to protect your wife, daughters from harassment in their own home and to protect your son from eroding his soul and conscience.

Love your nephew from a distance."
"Precisely. And hopefully he will learn from this, and other women won't have to put up with this ridiculous, invasive crap."
"There are some states where they are also available to grandparents after the parent that is their child dies, pretty much like this. But it's still a pretty case by case basis as to whether they are granted or not. "
"Does your husband realize just how badly he fucked up?  Is he now committed to making sure he's up-to-date on all his shots, and ideally spreading the word to other parents about just how important herd immunity is?  And is he willing to go to counseling with you to work through why he turned this thing he thought was stupid into a hill worth (someone maybe literally) dying on?

If not, then no, you're not overreacting.  Like you said, you don't lie to your spouse and risk your child's well-being to prove a point.  Especially a point that every reputable doctor and scientist has proven time and time again to be an idiotic one."
"Tom is great. But really, I lost the weight for me, not Tom. 

Tom didn't make me do anything. He was supportive, encouraging, helpful and most importantly, he was kind. He never once shamed me or made me feel ugly."
"I think it's amazing that this comment is the one you replied to OP. There are so many other comments you could have addressed. However, here you are basically blaming him for a relationship you forced him to have.

&gt;I thought the same thing, that **him allowing me** to meet his mom is what ultimately drove us apart.

You say that as if he could control you two running into each other at a grocery store. You say that as if you didn't pull one of the worst guilt trips you can do to a person:

&gt;In private that same day, is when we got in one of our first huge fights about her and that's when **I pretty much used my mother's death to persuade him to allow me to bond with his mom.**

You emotionally manipulated him into letting you have a relationship with her, during a fight no less, yet you expect him to trust you with his horribly abusive past. You expect him to trust you to be on his side, when you went directly against what you knew he wanted (which was no contact with the mother.)

You should edit this comment into your post OP. It gives a much deeper explanation as to why he didn't trust you. You admit to snooping, disregarding his requests for confidentiality, disregarding his feelings, and emotionally manipulating him yet you still attempt to rationalize your behavior as his fault because 'he didn't tell you enough'....

Just wow..."
"&gt; Paying for all 3 girls is too expensive, it's either Nicole or Christina. 

I was with you until this part.

Both girls are graduating, both should get equal value presents. So you're going to have to drop some other expenses and live on ramen for a little bit so your step daughter gets a present of equal value to your daughter's.

That could be a trip with her own friend or a different present but she should get a gift.

Honestly, what were you thinking? This isn't about the two girls not getting on. It's a much bigger problem that you thought to treat your daughter and left your husband's daughter out."
"Why are you and Amber not talking?

*I don't know what to tell you.  We were best friends, she got a boyfriend...and then she just completely ditched me.  I guess we weren't as close as I thought we were*

Don't feel like you have to sugar coat things to people.  Tell them the truth.  After she got a boyfriend, she decided you were expendable."
"Well you're not going to get very far as a scholar if you keep insisting that saying things like ""fine"" and ""okay"" just isn't possible because of your personality. Because your co-workers and the people you meet with regarding your research are going to think you're being rude."
"Or she can use his line in a condescending way: 

""Come on now, keep an open mind..."""
"&gt; ""What an interesting opinion.""

Ow, that's a good one."
Dont be naive. They totally had sex. I dont want to be harsh but I think you should stop seeing it as an emotional affair because this is a full-blown affair.  An affair that would still be going on if you hadnt caught him.
"Call him out, every single time, like the jerk that he is: ""That's not how a man talks to his daughter, you're like a pubescent asshole with a beer gut. Grow up and learn some manners, you infected pustule. You make me dry barf with your arrogant airs, talking to her like you think you're the shit, when actually, you're just shit."""
But not before donating a portion to the church. Gotta buy buy those indulgences before you jet off with your stolen money.
"What's funny is that they are the ones being rude and entitled, yet you will be the one seen as a rude asshole just for demanding your own privacy.

Anyways, you can either lie (e.g., sorry, we have guests already), change things (e.g., get rid of the couch or move), or just bite the bullet and tell them directly that you've decided that nobody is going to stay anymore.

They will think you are an asshole, but that's probably where this is heading regardless."
"This is a great update. I get the impression that your parents took how much you helped with your brothers for granted and did not adjust properly when you left. Just make sure to set boundaries for yourself so that you don't get drawn in as a parent figure, again. That shouldn't fall on you and is harmful to your relationship with your parents, your bothers, and their relationship with each other."
Absolutely do not brag about your BFs income to these people.  It really has nothing to do with it anyway.  They are just being snobs.  Don't participate in their snobbery.
"I agree, definitely need to clean up your act OP. A great way to start is by ditching the 20 year old deadweight and finding someone who appreciates you as a person and not as a bank statement."
"You met new people within one month because you're a nice person. You did well and this isn't your fault in any way. Keep doing what you're doing. It really sucks &amp; is super unfair, but you can find new people. Don't let a shitty draw discourage you!

Try to find people who don't have an established friendship with your douchebag ex bestfriend. This shouldn't be necessary in a mature world but alas. Also, please do not go to her house (think of what good could come of it for you: none)."
"She's using you.  Cut her off, close her out, go no contact.  

Never trust someone who wants to keep your relationship a secret.  To say nothing of her spending time with those people.  Her silence about you to them shows that she prioritizes them and her interactions with them over you.

Who knows what is going through her head, but whatever it is you're not the key part of it."
"Yeah, I have a relative like this. Her boyfriend makes a lot more than she does and he buys her nice things, which she then treats like crap because they have no real value to her - because she didn't spend her on money on them. I've watched her take a very nice Mac laptop and literally throw it onto the sofa from a distance of a few feet, where it bounced off and onto the floor. When that laptop broke (from repeated abuse) he bought her a new one, which she ruined on an airplane by jamming the lid under the lip of the seat in front of her while it was on the tray table. It flexed and bent. The things she buys herself she treats nicely because she is keenly aware of the value they hold, but when someone else's money paid for it, she doesn't give a flying fuck."
"Your brother should never be allowed anywhere near your children. If your parents are unwilling to celebrate without him on Father's day, offer to schedule a dinner with them to celebrate on another day.

You are the only and last line of protection for your children. Your parent's hurt feelings do not matter, and frankly, their enabling of someone who likely molested your daughter should have you on high red alert when it comes to your parents. If they're unable to understand that he cannot go to a *dinner* with the child he molested, do you think if he's ever finally out of the house and they're left alone with your child that they'll keep him away from her?"
"Honestly, if your relationship is so flimsy that you'd break up with someone over a haircut...you should definitely consider that break up."
"The grocery costs are the issue. I'm 5'3"" and eat like half of what my 6'4"" partner ate. When he was younger, he ate way more then double what i ate--he ate like a horse. Its not fair to split 50/50 when youre only getting 20/100 and he gets the other 80/100. "
"&gt; He is perfectly normal. He has nothing wrong with him at all. My mother is not happy about it. But she said there is nothing we can do. She is never home any way to care.

Your mother is a disgusting excuse for a parent. SHe should give at least a *tiny* crap about her son. My god I actually can't stand half your family. My sister is engaged and if she was saying what your sister said to a family member I'd not be able to stop myself from slapping her and telling her to grow a pair. If I were you, I'd refuse to go to that wedding and so would my brother and other sister. Show Lexi what happens when you disregard good people."
Could be worth it to post this on /r/sex too
"If you cannot trust him not to do this, it is stupid to marry.

Make it clear: cake smash = immediate divorce"
"She's not taking responsebility for her cheating, blowing it off with excuses blaming you. There is nothing to fix. From her moral standpoint, it's perfectly ok for her to go fuck somebody next time you isn't subjectivly good enough for her. In her mind, she's entitlet to screw around every time she's not satisfied with you.

You've known her for a long time, I'm sure there are some flags among the way that will have you question her ethics if you look back.

She got a job, so I don't think court will give her all your future income. Unless you got a shit lawyer."
"Yes, it is their granddaughter and no, they cannot give her anything they want. You are the parents and you have final say. 

There is a lesson here and that lesson is one of fairness. You have the chance to teach both children this lesson as you are going to give the car back to your in-laws. 

1.) Gifts are not conditional

2.) Luxury material things are not worth hurting someone else's feelings over

3.) If you want something real bad, work for it

Your daughter can get a job as well. She wasn't going to get a car, she isn't getting a car. She'll be sad, of course, but you need to make this decision for her. She is sixteen, it's too hard for her to choose your son and fairness over this shiny new object in the driveway that is ALL HERS. 

Take the car back, have your husband have a stern talk with your in-laws and never allow them to give gifts to your children before consulting you ever again."
"This. Totally. He just thought it would be OK to effectively steal her tickets from right under her nose (Edit to add: it didn't even seem like anyone was offering to reimburse her!) when he KNEW how much her mum was looking forward to it? It makes it so much weirder that they've only been dating for 2 months, too. Like at what point did he determine that what's hers is his and his to give?

It's weird, controlling, and frankly quite creepy. Like once you know how it goes down, I find all this super scary

&gt;showed my mom's texts to Josh because I thought it was so adorable, and he didn't say anything off but he was acting kind of strange after. He asked me what date the show we were going to was, I told him and then he went into the other room to take a phone call. 
&gt;He was in an unusually good mood afterwards

He was acting strange because OP's mum was looking forward to doing something with OP...he got the date (presumably so he could tell his parents), called them, confirmed that he would be giving away HER tickets to his sister...and then....he was in...a GOOD mood afterwards????

At first, I thought he must have been acting strange because he felt guilty/the jig was up when OP was talking about going with her mum. But no, it's almost like he was annoyed the he was doing something with her mum that made them happy...and then, he was happy after taking that away??"
"He said ""not multiple millions of dollars"", which leads me to think it's at least a million but less than two. 

If it's $1-2 million (say) then that's enough to support a reasonable lifestyle, forever, at a 3.5% safe withdrawal rate, which is generally considered the best rule of thumb for financial independence to allow you to maintain your capital and grow it with inflation while living off the interest. We're talking somewhere in the range $35K to $70K a year in today's money -- enough to fund a comfortable but not particularly luxurious lifestyle. 

"
Don't say anything. Act surprised. Maybe this is his way of ending it on a high note.
"Are you sure it's possible to be genuine friends with someone who despises your way of life to the extent of protesting at an event that is meant to be a celebration?


Would you be friends with her if she was racist, even if it's because her religion tells you that it's the right way to be?


Ultimately going to Pride is going to come down to what matters more to you: celebrating your sexuality and culture, or your friendship with your homophobic friend.


Orrrr wear a mask/costume so she can't recognize you."
"Sounds like he's insecure as fuck and projecting. Explain again why it bothers you, if he doesn't understand, maybe you have a guy friend who you keep bringing up to compliment. Hey may just be an asshole, but maybe he's really just that insecure and doesn't realize what an asshole he is being because of it."
"Agreed, have gone off as well, terrible idea. The only thing it's ever done is make me a lot more emotional, like a bad case of PMS - it's never given me the urge to cheat. Dump her."
"Yeah I didn't really understand what that was about, I mean she's a nice person or at least I thought she was a nice person.

But, any act of kindness I tried or even just acting like a normal human being to one another.

Thank you for your advice, I'll be ending it tomorrow."
Sounds like you are wasting your time here

"Tell him: ""I want you to stop criticizing or disparaging my gaming habits and food choices.  I respect your opinions, but past a certain point it becomes rude and disrespectful.  If you have a genuine concern about my behavior, then lets talk about it now so it can be put it to rest."""
"Guilty? Yes. Just as guilty? No. The father was the one who made a vow to be faithful to the mother. The other woman/new stepmother isn't blameless, but she doesn't have as much blame as the father, and it's weird that OP is blaming her more."
"Your boyfriend crossed your boundary and violated the No Contact restriction. Your boyfriend is in the wrong, and should be made aware that these boundaries are sacred. This was your sister's battle to deal with, it was her responsibility to put her father in check, and your boyfriend has overstepped her territory. This is actually not helpful to your sister. No Contact means No Contact. Explain to your boyfriend that should your sister actually die, her father will not be informed by anybody who respects her boundaries. I think your boyfriend is operating out of ignorance, so I don't think you should be mad at him, just explain the situation to him. Don't let your idiot dad's little power play screw up your evening with your boyfriend."
"Call the police every single time he comes to your apartment. If your building has an on-site manager/security desk/concierge, give them his picture and notify them that he's harassing you so a.) they know to never admit him to the building and b.) they can back you up by reporting him, too. "
"I'd leave her too. It seems like her friends and family are all superficial af. Who talks shit about a guy who's earnestly trying his best to learn? She didn't even bother checking on him. I mean sure, he didn't tell you he spoke it fluently and I'm glad he didn't cause through that lie, he got to see your true colors along with your friends and family."
"I had my Dad ready your post as he is a 25 year sober alcoholic. His words, ""Son I really feel for your situation and I want to let you know that even though you've done wrong in the past you have done a whole lot of right for the past decade. Your family was and is wrong to have cut you out when you were in a real hard spot. I advise you to not let them back in your life, the way they have treated you is inexcusable and it honestly sounds like they just want your money. "
"I don't see why you would expect your sister to pay for your step-children's education.  It's not like a family holiday, it's tens of thousands of dollars.  They're already being super generous to your family and, frankly, you sound unappreciative that they're not doing it in the way that you prefer.  One of my cousins used to get $10k a year from a relative on her dad's side every year for estate reasons.  Did I wish that I could also get $10k a year?  Darn tootin'! But, I recognized that while related by marriage, this person was not actually my relative so there was no real reason for them to give me any money and it didn't bother me."
"I completely agree, I was actually flabbergasted when people said ""you have one day a week to sleep in and do normal kid things, and you don't get a part time job?!""

"for half your relationship he was also with another woman. Never did he give you the opportunity to be in an open relationship, but he clearly viewed himself to be in one. He will only be sorry until you ""forgive"" him. Next time he probably wont get caught. Remember he didn't volunteer this information-it came from the other woman he was screwing, and screwing over. Your 25...you are at the best time of your life and you shouldn't have to waste it with scumbag man-child over here. "
"Send a single message telling him not to contact you again. When he inevitably does, take yourself and all the proof he's contacting you down to your local police station. Explain the situation and ask that they send him an official cease and desist notice as the first step in starting a harassment case against him. If he continues after that, you take all the addition proof you now have back down there and tell them you need to file harassment charges and will need to get started on filing a restraining order.

Sadly, they see shit like this all the time, and they'll know how to handle things. Usually it only takes them showing up once to scare the crap out of the person bothering you. By doing things this way, you're getting the paper trail started that will make their job so much easier."
"&gt; I decided to permanently and formally end things with her

Just in time for summer, too! Good move."
So he started dating Anna when she was 15 and he was 20?  No wonder he's taken by the way she looks now compared to when he knew her before - she's finally an adult.  He sounds like a scumbag from start to finish.
Haha I guess I shouldn't of left that part out. My parents were shocked by his behaviour. Apparently they spent a long time talking about whether they should bring it up with me. They are both very non-confrontational type people and they always said they would try not to pass judgement on who I date. But kevin was just too much for them and they were planning on telling me what they thought of him. Fortunately for my parents by the next time I talked to them we had already broken up haha. So they were definitely relieved
"Yes! Sounds like she's just cherishing photos and doesn't want to accidentally delete them. 

I have tons of pictures of my SO. Sometimes when I get thoughts like ""what if he got into an accident..."" I get frantic and start backing up all my photos, videos, etc. because that's all I'll have of him.

Honestly, it sounds like she just loves OP."
"My point is that I think she *does* want a child at some point. Or thinks she does. What she doesn't want is a baby.

She waited too long before checking if she was pregnant. She refuses to say who the father is which would give him parental rights if she wanted to go off to another country. She refuses adoption which would prevent her from coming back into the child's life and taking over in the future.

There are a lot of coincidences and decisions here that suggest she wanted a kid, but doesn't want to raise it at the moment. Authority without responsibility. "

"Smh, I didn't see this comment but I'm surprised she even needed to write this post given this tidbit of information.  Obviously he has a huge problem if he needs to be staring at people screwing in order to get off during sex.  Having sex with someone you love is supposed to be fulfilling in and of itself and it's supposed to turn someone on to the point where they don't need extra simulation to cum.  I have never heard of anyone needing to stare at porn while having sex in order to get off, this is pretty extreme.  Also, masturbating three times a day to porn?  Yeah, he is seriously addicted.  He needs therapy as soon as possible if he's open to it."
"Yea so youre the only one that will put up with him. Stop giving him that out. for completely different reasons and nonromantic, i became this for someone with an insufferable personality. it is not your responsibility to take care of someone who claims they don't give a flying fuck what anyone thinks, and then pouts when everyone hates them. enjoy your life without the leech. he isnt changing. 

make sure to tell him you dont want to be contacted this time. he has made his pretentious little bed, he can lie in it. "
"I guess the question is, can you deal with dating someone who isn't ready to be out? "
"On the other hand, OP stated that the $80K didn't put her out very much thanks to the inheritance. So if it allowed her to get a clearer picture of her intended before they actually signed a marriage license, I'd say that's a pretty good price for the lesson."
"&gt; the kid will be a mixed race kid with two white bread parents.

This is actually an important point...as the child gets older, they may want info on their heritage that their parents can't provide.  Will you be comfortable guiding the kid in these things?  It could be as simple as showing your ex how to do their hair, or having discussions about race relations that your ex and her husband won't have any experience in.  You're obviously not obligated to be the go to person for that stuff with the child, but you may be the one your ex and the child think of first when these issues come up.  It's definitely something to consider."
"Sorry to be blunt, but James is not mature enough to get married. If he can't stand up to his overbearing sister, he's putting her feelings before yours. If he think she is being reasonable, then he has clearly has no idea that marriage is a bond built on trust and loyalty to your partner, not to your fucking sister. 

You guys are young &amp; have been together a year. Pump the brakes on the wedding and get some premarital counseling.

Side note - what the hell is wrong with her? What 28 year old woman honestly thinks she can tag along on her little brother's honeymoon? Insane."
"It's also a common way of expressing negative emotions, like when you realize your fiancé might leave you"
"What the fuck? The grandparents sound awful. Of course it's a problem created by the grandparents and not properly handled by the husband. 

My proposition is to sit down the step-daughter and explain to her what the situation is. Try to get her to empathize with her stepbrother and think about the situation had it been reversed. 

Also may depend on who technically owns the car. If the step-daugther holds title, might be OK to just ignore grandparents' wishes (with buy-in from step-daughter) and tell them to shove it. "

"&gt; What did I do wrong?

The only thing I really see here that you did wrong is that you got really emotionally invested without having any commitment from him. 

&gt;  I'm trying to recover from the hurt and the disrespectful behavior, since I showed him all the respect in the world. 

In an ideal world, people would treat us the way we treat them. But that isn't really the world that we live in, and you can't nice somebody into treating you well. You mentioned that you should've noticed his actions earlier- really, all you can do is take a lesson from that going forward. The next time those fluttery feelings are clouding your head, take a mental step back and look at how you're being treated. You were taught to always put other people before yourself, but that's honestly doing you a disservice in your relationships. Treat people as equal to yourself, and go from there.

&gt; I really hate myself for the past two months that we've been involved

You didn't do anything worthy of hatred. You got over-invested in a guy who wasn't really that into you, and you're hurting. You feel like a fool, but all of those negative things you're feeling really just boil down to you being hurt. Take care of yourself emotionally. Let yourself be angry, and be hurt, and be sad, but don't wallow in it. 

Think about your situation as if it were happening to a friend, or to your little sister. You wouldn't hate her. You'd want to give her a hug. Treat yourself with that same compassion, okay? 
"
"No, it's not messed up. If you were my friend, I'd actively encourage you to be in public and even have a friend nearby when you break up with him. Have you considered breaking up with him over text? Or are you really dedicated to doing it face to face?"
Has she ever offered to replace anything or come up with a solution?
"As a whole, though, negative reinforcement is a bad idea for weight loss because it increases feelings of weight discrimination and makes it more likely that people will gain weight, not lose it. I got [very specific](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4myzb1/my_23f_bf_30m_snapped_and_said_he_hates_the_way_i/d3zxgg7?context=3) about this topic on a different /r/relationships thread last week, so if you're interested in more info, you can follow that link.

You're right, though. He really shouldn't be shaming others for their choices, especially when he doesn't know their stories. Continuing to do so will put him on a very lonely road."
"Oh I hate people that think its okay to criticise skinny people. I have always been thin and my sister always on the podgy side. To make my sister feel better my mom would always say ""you don't want to be like HVH_19, she's a bag of bones, its disgusting. You have curves and you are beautiful"" Literally when I was in the room. 

I hate people. Keep up your efforts of a healthy lifestyle and tell those people to leave you and your body alone!"
"Your in laws sound shady - having large amounts of cash and gold seems a good way of hiding money from the authorities. You could leave anonymous messages on the fundraising page or anonymously tip off the media, but that would no doubt make it worse. I would just put some distance between them and your family. 

Also, there is no way their gold would have 'burned' in the fire. The average temperature of a house fire is 1300 F and while the melting point of gold is 1900 F, the boiling point (at which you get evaporation) is about 5000 F. So the gold may have melted but couldn't possibly have burned up. Though of course they'd have to get it re-cast.

Edit: fixed up temperatures."
We do live together which makes it a little more difficult.. I don't have too many things so I can just use my car for those. Hopefully she accepts my final decision but if not I'll see what my options are in terms of the living situation. 
That shit's cold. I'm sorry.

"Take your child and the bare necessities and go stay with your parents or a trusted friend.  If you realize you forgot something you can call your local dispatcher and have a squad car and officers meet you at the house and escort you in to get what you need.

What you have described is textbook emotional and verbal abuse, the fact that he got physical and destroyed things doesn't bode well either, best case scenario he realizes he is driving you and your children out of his life and he agrees to get help, worst case you have to get a divorce.

Do not let this escalate to the point of him getting g physical with you, based on how he treats your son I would say it's unlikely he would hurt him, but it's still a dangerous and unhealthy environment for a child.

Hope this helps, stay strong.

&lt;3"
"You may not see it as abusive, and it's not abusive (technically), however..if I were her, I would be upset as well - that you *know* you're clumsy and you hurt her often and you *still* don't pay enough attention to prevent it. That would be very upsetting to me. 


&gt; when the (inevitable) mistakes occur

dude, they *aren't* inevitable. "
"I agree wth you. I've seen myself that people who come from a happy families just can't wrap their minds around what it's really like to have a family member who is toxic. They may accept that you have no contact but they tend to assume that conflicts are at least somewhat two-sided or the result of misunderstandings or outside events. The idea that parent would intentionally harm, manipulate or exploit a child is completely foreign to them. When you try to explain the inner workings of a toxic person and how everything they do is calculated and every communication has a subtext that you understand even if they don't, to them it just reads as you being unnecessarily dramatic or paranoid. They don't mean to be invalidating or bad partners. In fact, the nicer someone is the harder it is for them to grasp. They just don't get it. 

If I were you, I would just explain to him that this is one area of your life that you need  him to step away from and let you control entirely. He doesn't have to understand it. He doesn't have to like it. It's a hard boundary for you that he *must* respect for the sake of your emotional well-being. I would phrase it in terms like ""shouldn't my emotional well-being be more important to you than the feelings of a man who abused me?"""
"Basically, he wants to fuck his way around europe and wants you to be ok with it.  So you need to decide if you're ok with it or not."

You're going to have to completely cut contact with this one. If you don't, he'll make it his mission to get you to meet up with him and that scares me on your behalf. He's already been working you with some of the things he said, so don't give him another chance. 

You're clearly a thoughtful and intelligent young woman; you'll find a guy that's right for you soon. :)"
"You're not being unreasonable. If it was two blocks away, he could have kindly asked you for a ride or walked his butt to his friend's place.

That being said, I disagree with your assessment that it is ""inappropriate"" for a friend to ask to borrow another's car. Some people are ok with it, some are not. Different strokes for different folks."

Don't name Carrie beyond ""Someone who demanded my services for free and who now appears to have begun a campaign of harassment"""". Basically they need to think of you as a wronged victim who didn't do anything to deserve this, not a mudslinger who is just as bad. Don't say anything you don't want a future client to read.

You didn't push him to do this. He didn't want to miss his chance to meet up with this girl. He didn't care how that made you feel. Do you want to be with someone that tells you to change and makes you feel like you aren't enough? Get home and bail on him.

"Wow! I am a high school physics teacher and can say for sure he is behaving badly.   When I was 28 I had my then girlfriends little sister as a student.  Even though I knew her little sister very well before accepting a job  (I had gone on several family vacations with them).  I was always very professiobal.   It was always Mr. Lastname.  And I was always very fair and tried to ignore my out of school relationship with her.  And much to the little sisters credit  (and maturity) she never talked about what I was like outside of school.  We both kept a very professional working relationship.  And aside from the occasional ""see u later for diner"" after school when not in front of other students.  Or the occasional help session at her parents as I was there often, being close with their family, it was never an issue.  This guy is certainly behaving in an unprofessional way.  It sounds like he is on some kind of sad little power trip.  He should treat your brother like everyone else. Discussing a student casually like that would be in poor taste.  I almost never talked about it with my gf unless I was sharing general work anecdotes.   And my gf never asked.  This sounds like all sorts of wrong.  I would talk to your parents about it.  Any intervention should come from them with input from you as needed.  "
"I would talk to her but she's got the memory of a goldfish, I think after a week she'd go right back to doing it. I don't want to get into a ""thing"" over this since we will, hopefully, be moving many states away in a few months. Side note I should just be happy she's taking showers on a regular basis. When we first moved in it was once every 2 wks."
"She may be mad that you burst her bubble, but she should get over that. She has been asking your advice, so you by no means overstepped any boundaries. "
"Yeah, but there is just one problem, when I ignored him too much, he comes to my place. Then I tell him to stop, then he leaves me alone for a month or so, and then restart the cycle. Will look into it, thanks"

"Does your daughter ever play on your computer? It's feasible to me that she would love having candid photos of you, and possibly locked it to prevent your daughter unintentionally deleting it while playing. I don't see the harm in asking her about it. Just approach the subject out of curiosity and not accusation."
you say that like cheating isnt reason enough
What does she do for work?  It seems odd that she doesn't have any disposable income only paying for a car and internet.
"Go to the police-- Michelle's been there a lot longer than you, so your ""no paper work dropped shift"" sounds more like then trying to protect her and setting you up to be disposable. call 911, file a report, and take pictures of any injuries and write down the names of witnesses."
"I know :/ I kind of want to just go there right now and confront her but that might not seem as normal, it might seem more casual and less aggressive if I ask to speak with her next time I pick him up. I just don't feel comfortable letting him go to work though when I know this is going on. "
"I'm sorry if this sounds harsh, but as a pet lover, I think your girlfriend's perfectly allowed to prioritise her pets, who depend solely on her, above your kids. If there's blood at the base of the whiskers, it sounds like the whiskers weren't just cut, but pulled off. That must have been incredibly painful for that poor wee kitten and very malicious on your daughter's part. 

I know that in your girlfriend's shoes I too would start having second thoughts on embarking on something long term with you and your family. It's normal that she's very, very pissed. She's not being dramatic; and please don't ever tell her that. You'll only worsen the situation.

Unfortunately there's not much you can do. Your daughter needs lots of therapy, more, or different than what she's getting. Pulling off the whiskers instead of cutting them sounds like escalation. What's next? It's just horrible to think.

Your girlfriend needs to remove her pets, keep them in her own apartment and decide if she wants to deal with your family life. Thankfully, the whiskers will grow back."

"Why are you even talking to him?

You know how you avoid this?  Just block him and never talk to him again.  There is literally no reason to ever speak to him again.  He was abusive, and it was five years ago.  Most likely he is reaching out because you are engaged and he still feels like he can ""possess"" you.

No. You've done everything perfectly up to this point. Don't get yourself involved any further. The poor woman is definitely going to find out on her own soon enough. This is NOT your problem. Good luck OP.
"I've never been raped in my life.  
I still don't claim to be 'clueless' when it comes to how horrible and prevalent sexual assault is.

I imagine it must be pretty awful. 18/19 is not an age where most people want to be completely on their own with no parental support whatsoever.
"Following the basic cultural norms of the country you're in is really not like asking you to change your whole personality. Most people just say, ""I'm fine/good/okay, how are you?"" Even if they're not fine. Kind of weird? Maybe. But a normal thing there and fortunately it means he's not really asking for details of your life, just making polite small talk.

If you are working in a field that requires research and working with people from other cultures it is very much necessary to learn to adapt to some basic niceties of the culture of the person you're speaking to."
"That doesn't mean that you are obligated to continue to do it. In fact, you should stop doing it immediately. He needs as much time as possible to move on and get his life in order. Every day that you continue to lead him on is bad for him."
"I'm betting that he felt unsupported because he wants to go to Vancouver and now that seems really hard/impossible. And he tried to express this but isn't good at it. You dismissed this issue and told him to change schools. He REALLY doesn't want to do that and saw his dream crumbling before his eyes. He's super upset, but doesn't know how to express it. The subject gets changed, and suddenly roles are reversed. He sees you asking him to support him emotionally when you just refused to do the same thing for him (when what really happened was that you weren't aware of how upsetting this was for him and reacted according to what you saw). He is hurt, upset, grieving his dream, and expresses an emotion that he's got a grip on, one he's been taught is socially acceptable for guys to portray - Anger. 

Y'all have some issues with communication that need to be resolved before you get hitched. "
"I had a second degree burn once from hot food landing on my lap, it could definitely count as physical abuse."
Number 3 is huge. I've lived with people who are always home and it drove me nuts. Sometimes you need to walk around naked talking to inanimate objects without anyone watching.
I've got some long labia that I was always self conscious about. At worst they can be uncomfortable at times in certain pants. I had some insecurities over it when I was younger but my fiance does not care about the shape of my lady parts. DO NOT SLEEP WITH THIS PERSON ANY LONGER. He does not respect you or your body. Get away from him
Not to mention he told her he was learning. Her family could NEVER reasonably have assumed that he spoke ZERO Korean. They are so trashy!!!! I say that as a Korean American myself.

Your husband should have cut her out the minute she tried to convince him not to marry you. You are his *wife* and his first priority now. There is no excuse to let some cow call you names in your own home, no matter how bad of a day she's had. And she has no right to judge whatever financial decisions you and your husband decide on.

Your husband is being an idiot.

When you are calm, make up a list of all the reasons how Sasha has wronged you, and give it to your husband. You are more likely to get your way when you approach a situation when you're calm and reasonable.

Tell your husband he needs to cut contact with anyone who disrespects his wife. At the very least, she is never allowed in your home again."
"...because if this ""amazing girl"" doesn't set some god damn boundaries with her family and you marry her, this is the life you will be living forever. No privacy, basically you run and live in a motel. So, if she can't set reasonable boundaries and enforce them with her family, you should run so you don't have to put up with this forever. I promise there are plenty of amazing girls out there that can set boundaries with their family. Hopefully your girl is one of them. "
"A guy I'm not dating or having sex with put more effort into surprising me with dinner at a place I'd been wanting to go to for a while than you did for your do-over proposal.

Your fiancee is thrilled because over the course of the last five years, you've set the bar *that low.*

If you don't stop putting the least amount of effort in to get the rewards you want (I guess sex, since you spent half of your post talking about all the sex you're having), your fiancee is going to end up very, very unhappy. I suspect you don't much give a damn, though."
"They have not been good friends to you and they have been bad friends to Jake in this situation. 

They are deeply patronising to think that the best he can hope for in his romantic life is a pity date from you. There is no reason to think this young man cannot form a happy romantic relationship with someone else, it just won't be with you. His sensible reaction to the kind and polite way in which you turned him down once you were able to speak to him alone suggests that he will do very well in his relationships in future as he has a good understanding of boundaries. 

It was wrong to attempt to set up a date with a girl who has a boyfriend.

It was incredibly wrong to then attempt to guilt you into dating him. You do not owe anybody a date.

""" to be honest, we have known each other sense elementary school. Steve I let you live with me and covered for you when you met your now wife. I feel we are friends and close, but not being invited to either of your weddings let me know what are level of friendship is. I'd like to keep spending time with you and hanging out, but I and my fiancée also have family and cultural obligations about our guest list like you did, so the amount of people is due to family obligations and inviting people that invited us to their wedding. I hope you understand like I understood when you made your choices about your wedding."" 

You don't owe these people an invite. At max invite them to the small dinner, but they showed you the value of your friendship is to them. Sense I guarantee there were people there who didn't know the grooms sense lil kids and the wives the whole relationship at least. Invite the guys to the bachalor party and everything else is in their court. Gift wise remind them you took them to dinner, but the gift is a ""wedding present"" given at the wedding.

"I think there's some misinterpretation going on here. /u/Infidelityonthelake's boyfriend isn't condoning cheating when he says it's between them, but rather he would like to give his friend the opportunity to man up and admit his wrongdoings so that the friend has no one to blame but himself.

It's tough because I've actually experienced this...Saw a friends GF cheating on him and decided to give her a day to tell him the truth before we did. She spun it in such a way that ""we misunderstood what we saw"" and that she ""had only been talking to a friend"" and ""we had always disliked her"".

"Good decision. I found it odd how much blame-laying there was in the comments to your first post, when the answer is obvious: 

No matter who was right and who was wrong, the relationship was done the second you had sex with your friend. That was a dumb move if you wanted to get back together with her. She made a dumb move by dumping you but really just being like ""jk we're still together."" 

The situation just got fucked in every hole possible, so you made the right call to end it. She'll come to that realization in time. "

"No, I highly doubt that is going to be possible. They're a married couple now - a unit. You can't refuse to be civil with one of them but carry on a normal relationship with the other.

Better yet, dad, can you just ask her to leave?"" I imagine you're angry enough that sounds reasonable to you, but it's not. And it's very unrealistic."

"I would recommend not saying ""doing what I thought was right."" Instead, I would suggest ""I have nothing to apologize for."" If OP says that she just did what she thought was right, then she's admitting she actively did something. She didn't. She supported Katie in Katie's decision to get an abortion. I realize that you said that earlier in the paragraph, but Katie and her fiance are really only going to remember OP's refusal to apologize and her saying ""I did what I thought was right."""
Yes it's been tough but I'm holding my ground and I have no regrets about making this decision. I'm really happy to hear that everything worked out for you! 
Gah!!!! The point is not to give your wife a much needed break(though that's needful) it about spending fucking quality time with your daughter!!! What about her??? You want her to grow up thinking that her dad and brother think she's boring? That her brother's interest in her is what dictates her fathers affection?  That Daddy doesn't want to play with her? That daddy doesn't care for her emotional needs? Wake up!!! Your daughter needs a DAD not just mom. 100% mom attention is NOT the same as 50-50 mom/dad. Please also recognize that partial parental attention is not zero attention. Your wife can spend quality time with your son AND your daughter at the same time and so can you. Spend sometime to figure that out.

"Speaking from experience, you will not be able to reason with her by yourself. She's already too far gone and you trying to tackle this alone will most likely just cause her to be angry at you for trying to ""control"" her. Your best bet is to inform her family and then all of you can handle it together. Rehab, therapy, whatever is necessary.

I don't mean to be pessimistic but you've most likely got a long road ahead of you, if you plan on staying with her through all of this. I would expect the best but prepare for the worst if I were you."
"You described your husband as a greasy, pimply, deadbeat, and your BIL as ""smoking hot"". You have within your power the ability to ruin your own life, as well as the lives of everyone around you. Good luck."
"Your husband needs to set clear boundaries with his parents. He needs to explain that giving a gift like that to their granddaughter is very nice but very disrespectful to his family, which includes you and Chad, especially with the bullshit rule about Chad never being allowed to use it. That's such a huge slap in the face to the you and Chad. You're both your husband's family, not just Stephanie. If the grandparents want to do something like that in the future, they need to run it past BOTH of you beforehand. If they don't, you and your husband, as a united force, should stop all contact with them. Also, who is paying for the gas and insurance on the car? 

It sounds like Stephanie needs a dose of reality, too. Does she not care how much this hurts Chad? Do they normally get along, or is there some tension? Does your husband have a close relationship with Chad? 

God, I feel for you. This really is a fucked up situation. "
"As the adult daughter of a persistently, toxically mentally unhealthy woman, I have to jump in here. It is *not a good idea* for OP to be his father's caregiver, to do ""everything in [his] capacity,"" because that puts OP in the line of fire. OP's father doesn't want him around and is unwilling to accept help from OP anyway. If OP's dad is having a serious mental health episode, he needs professional help, not his son's ill-considered self-sacrifice. You can't set yourself on fire to keep others warm.

"It's an accounting thing.  For as long as a gift card/voucher/coupon etc  is unexpired,  it has to be counted as a liability.   That's why you see 'cash value 1/20th of a cent'  on coupons -  so the issuer doesn't have a massive liability on their books."
"Well, it happens a lot that a guy one-sidedly covers a gal in attention, and she just discards it as innocent or even likes it. 

What needs to happen is that she tells him it's inappropriate and that if he's unhappy in his marriage, he needs to leave. That he has a right to be happy and that he can find someone that fulfills him. And that that someone is not her, so he needs to release the feelings he has for her. But that I'd he wants to, they can still be pen pals, that she'd like that, because he's a good friend. But nothing more.

If she doesn't tell him, there is no other choice but to cut the relationship or for OP and her to accept that they are helping emotional cheating, plus him forever staying unhappy. Both options aren't good."
When you heard this why did you insist on forced interaction? Why did you keep insisting on it when it went bad every time. Go reread how you described your fiancé. She sounds like she's the type of person who could easily get on someone's nerves. It sucks that they don't get along but forcing them to hang out is not the solution. With the wedding stuff you either invite both or neither. 
"&gt; But I feel like someone whose immediate reaction is to call the freaking police when seeing a topless woman in her own home through a window isn't gonna be particularly receptive to whatever reasonable argument you have to make when you confront them face to face.

I feel the same way, especially when OP stated that she lives in a place where it's legal for women to be topless in public. If it's okay for her to be topless on the sidewalk, then it's damn sure okay for her to be topless in her own home. People who don't get that aren't the type who hear reason very well."
"So, Golden Child, it's time to step up. Because make no mistake about it. Your sister is the scapegoat, your father abuses her, and if you sit back and let it happen, you are enabling the abuse of a child.

"The thing is, you can only really speak for yourself, dude. Heather seems to have less of a rapport with Alyssa--she literally admitted it to you. And that's fine! That's perfectly fine if their personalities mesh in a different way. But don't make Alyssa pretend that the difference isn't there.

I mean. Five years of inside jokes and secret confidences, without a thought of how she might feel if/when she finds out? Then she finds out through facebook? And when she's hurt by it, she's called a drama queen? It's all Heather's prerogative, of course, but please don't act like Alyssa's insecurities and feelings of exclusion have no basis in reality.

When I told my sister that I was jealous of how close she was to our brother, *she didn't tell my brother*. She helped me become closer to him, started becoming more aware of the times when they were unintentionally excluding me and tried to become more inclusive, and basically set an example for our brother not to take my efforts for granted. It was one of the most touching things she has ever done for me, and it helped cement *our* bond. Also my little brother never found out what an emotional mess his big sister had been over feeling left out, which helped me save face on that front. 

So I think you may have messed up a bit, dude, blowing the whole thing wide open in front of Heather without Alyssa's permission. Maybe if you had given her a bit more time, or talked it through with her, she could have at least sorted out a way to communicate her thoughts better. Alyssa feeling insecure about her place as a sister and Heather feeling angry that her coming out had become so dramatic are really two different issues that should be dealt with separately, but now it's all tangled up. I think you owe Alyssa an apology for betraying her confidence, at the very least."
"It's assumed that she leaves, not because that's the ""right"" thing to do, but because someone who would sexually assault someone might also try to physically assault her to prevent her from leaving.

In other words, she leaves for her own safety. Sometimes it's better to be unhurt than it is to be right."
"This is a good idea. Like, ""Remember when I wouldn't let my daughter be a flower girl because of my dad? Well, here's why."" That ties it to a previous event that they remember and will hopefully help them believe that you're telling the truth, since it explains a lot about a previous situation. It makes it seem less likely that you're just trying to start shit, you know? I think this might be a good intro. "

"I also don't think it's fair that people are giving OP grief for going to his mom against his wishes.

It's like a kid with chocolate smeared on their face saying, ""I can't explain now, but don't look in the cookie jar."" I can't imagine what could be so secretive and yet totally innocent. If the girl is in danger, and the fiance initially felt it best to conceal what was going on, he should have changed his approach when OP questioned him. The very WORST way to keep a secret is to be openly secretive about it! It's just inviting curiosity. "
"You can approach him and say, good friend, we've known each other a long time and I've enjoyed having you as a roommate, and one would think that, because of how well we get along, there would never be a deal breaker that would cause me to ask you to leave.

Your girlfriend is obnoxious and disrespectful toward me in my home, and I don't want her to ever step foot in my house again for any reason, or any amount of time. Now there are two ways to accomplish this, one, you simply tell her to never come over here again. And since she comes over only to see you, the second option is to make sure you aren't here. Dude, I love you like a brother, and I'm so happy you have a girlfriend, you are so welcome here, but she is so not, and if I have to ask you to move out in order to make sure she never graces my doorway again, then so be it. I've been pushed to the limit, I've made my decision, and if I ever see her here again, I'll know you've made yours."
"Yeah. Going while leaving your brother behind is just as bad.

You should hang out with him and have a good day with him. Let him know one of his sisters values him."
"I know that when I get out of work early, my first instinct is to spend 4 hours with a female coworker and let my wife come home to an empty house with a stranger's car parked in front.  It's what makes me such a great guy.  

Let's be real.  You didn't mention your company on the ride because you didn't want to have that conversation before you left - but once you were gone there wasn't anything she could do about it until you got home.  You got to enjoy the ride, and then you convinced yourself your GF was wrong to be upset about it because you didn't technically hide anything (in your own mind).  "
I'm wondering if he was pressured into asking her a bit by others around him. Which would really not be ok and would actually be kind of cruel since they would've known OP has a bf.
"As someone who is overweight and actively trying to fix that I wouldn't want my beat friend, who is pretty tiny, to offer. I work out by myself because that what makes me comfortable. Give verbal encouragement but don't offer to workout with them, let them ask if they want to. "
"Or start blasting ""Cotton-Eyed Joe"" or something like that. At full volume. Should be pretty difficult to have sex with that in the background."
"I like this idea, OP, but if you really can't trust him to respect your wishes on what you want done to you, you need to think twice about this marriage. "
"I would keep trying to walk up to her. Either she'll keep running away and hopefully eventually feel too awkward to keep it up or you'll get a chance to confront her. If scenario two happens I'd be polite and act somewhat clueless ""hi Olivia, long time no see, how are you? I sure see you around a lot, do you work here too?"""
"Oh lord I saw that one. Not only did he object, he thought it was comedy GOLD and got severely butthurt that it was removed from the wedding video. He was even told not to act out and did it anyway. I think just about every family has someone like this and it sucks because the one in our family just isn't invted to events like this because he cannot exercise self control. If he doesn't act out at least once during an event I think he might explode at the seams. And it's akways something stupid and cliche. Like ""losing the rings"" or at his wedding, the friggin cake smash. That he was told do not do it. He did it and guess what, she got sick of his shit within 5 years, conveniently when he went broke, lost the family business, and had nothing left to offer but his ""sense of humor"". "
"I don't know you, but, save for gender, we could be the same person based on your description.

Looking back...I was terrified when I was doing what you are doing.

It was about control.  It's hard being an 8 year old kid getting the shit beat out of you by your parent.  You just want to feel safe and loved from anyone.

There is a way you can guarantee that, and it's going to sound stupid.  Love yourself.

For me, when I realized that I can't control other people, I can only control myself...peace began to set in.

I can only do the best with the information I have at hand.  I can't control what anyone else does, not even a little bit.

Maybe you aren't like that, but letting go and realizing that I can only control myself and my life allowed me to let things that I couldn't control go.

You can't control if someone else loves you, but you can love yourself.

You can't control if someone else beats you each night as a kid.  You can make sure that if you decide to have kids that they will NEVER experience that from you.  

You can't make someone be faithful to you.  You can be the best partner that you can be to them though...and if they cheat, then it is ALL on them.

I am so sorry.  Please seek some help and learn to love yourself and be ok with who you are.  It's not easy to learn, but it's like riding a bike; once you've got it, you've got it."
"Agreed. 

Not to sound malicious, but it sounds like OP is setting up his son to take part of the blame for the inevitable issues that will arise when this new woman and her son move in, since life changes like this are not always smooth.

Also, OP has an oddly lax attitude about saying this stepson-to-be is good-looking. He has also immediately jumped to the conclusion that his son is jealous, which is odd. His son may feel as though he is being replaced, as though his father has chosen this new kid to shoulder his hopes and dreams instead of him."

"That frankly sounds very co-dependant and honeymoon period to me. Where you want to spend every waking moment together. My boyfriend and I chat all day and spend a lot of time together when we're at home and sometimes he irritates me and I want him to leave me alone for a bit and vice versa. The other day when I was trying to sleep and he sat on the edge of the bed loudly singing to our dog, I wanted to scream. I can absolutely picture a life without him-but I CHOOSE every day to be with him and love him, and have a future with him. Not because I would shrivel up and die without him.

Some day she is going to get sick and tired of you and vice versa. Real love and relationships aren't fairy tales. It's up to you to keep loving each other and working things out even when things aren't perfect. And her telling you to just trust her and that she knows you are ready. . . no way. Marriage is way too big a deal if you're not 100% on board.

"
"Your brother seems to be picking her over you in this case, however. Has he done anything to resolve this issue? 

Though it does make sense to stay on his wife's good side, since he is unlikely to get custody as a parent in the military.

A picture of the note could be useful for future use however. Who knows? "
How nice are australians on reddit! Im in the UK and want to come for beers!
"It's so insidious too! I dated a guy who seemed to like that I was smart and picked up stuff quickly, but it was at a time when we weren't putting in the same amount of work. Later we started to put in similar amounts of work. Sometimes I did better, and sometimes he did. He started to change. I ended up doing most of the cooking and cleaning, and he expected me to just accept things as they were. We listened exclusively to music he liked, watched TV shows he liked, and the only time we spent together was doing things he liked.

Those misogynist ideas he had carried over, slowly at first but they did. OP, get out now. Don't sacrifice your future for some guy who, in the end, is (more than likely) going to expect you to act like a Stepford trophy wife."

This is why I come here. The past 6 days have been a fog. I haven't told anyone and have been just a mess. I really do need honesty from strangers who are outside of this. Thank you.
It wasn't your decision to make. He was a grown man and didn't need protecting. The same applies now -- he's a grown man and he doesn't need protecting from his career of choice. Learn from your mistakes and leave him alone.
"I already gave him the suggestion about simply depositing money in the existing credit union account. He still wanted to cosign on my new account- which is a huge warning sign to me. His one crappy reason doesn't even apply to the potential new account. Also, about the control thing- it's not just me. He has been a cosigner on my older (20F) sisters' account since she turned 18, but she seems to be okay with this. She doesn't work as much as I do, so I think it hasn't crossed her mind. We are hosting an exchange student who is a minor and he insisted on cosigning on her bank account even when the international student director at her school recommended against because sharing financial responsibility between citizens of two countries is generally a bad plan. He claims that ""it would be a problem in parents less trustworthy than him"" but I believe that everyone untrustworthy started out being perceived as trustworthy until they first broke that trust. So why should I give him or anyone else that opportunity?"
"The people suggesting therapy have obviously never actually had therapy for a phobia. Thanks to therapy for vertigo I can now stand on a chair to change a lightbulb but there's no way in hell I'm ever going to live in a high rise. If you want to live with her, rehome the cat responsibly."
"&gt;Why your relatives are so goddam ungrateful is beyond me.

My guess is that they're already wealthy. "
"Yeah really.

&gt;they wanted a large family

&gt;It's almost certain now that she will never have another baby on her own without IVF because of complications.

Why not keep the money for the next round of IVF?"
OP will be dating that girl by christmas. 
"It sounds like your friends need a reality check. Tell Steve that you're hurt he didn't consider your expensive dinner out a wedding present, and tell them both that you're hurt you weren't invited to their weddings. Personally, I'd tell them that you're at capacity, and you had to prioritise people who'd invited you to their weddings over others who didn't. If you're feeling snarky I'd throw in a little ""you understand how these things go, we have to cut people all the time. Sorry bro."""
"I am immensely glad you were able to find a solid middle ground. I am also *endlessly* amused that you are on here, and want to dictate the responses you get (regarding her honesty).

Regardless of her motivations, and the sense (or lack of) guilt, it sounds like you two were able to bury the hatchet. I hope you two are able to have a kickass camping trip, and you can reforge the bonds that might have frayed a bit since this all started.

Good luck!"
"I don't really think there's anything *to* do. You are both very lucky to be so compatible with each other and have more than many other couples! It sounds like your relationship is really good. Only thing you might want to think about is your desire for other women.

Seeing as you both were comfortable talking about fantasising about others...you guys could perhaps consider an open relationship if you find the desire to be with attractive people to be too strong?

I get this might be an unpopular opinion, but just throwing it out there: you guys could have arrangements for paid sex with attractive people which might get your mind off thinking about what it'd be like to sleep with others? Swingers clubs?

I've been in an open relationship for almost 9 years now and it's worked out fantastically for us. If you guys aren't the jealous type and you both trust each other enough not to break rules, it might be worth thinking about.

Then again, sex with other people might backfire and fuel your desire even more lol!"
"Oh! As far as keeping creepy stuff goes, my mom still has my umbilical cord! It's all dried up and in an envelope in my ""baby box""               

...shit, maybe I'm weird and from a weird family..."
Even more reason to be rid of him. Letting a friend abuse a wife is unforgivable. 
Its almost 99.99999% likely to be not real and everything you just typed is bullshit.
I may be mistaken but to me it seemed like she payed off his debt after getting engaged to him. It sounds like he may have just proposed to get her money. 
"Sounds like a normal cat. No blood drawn,. Ordinary kitty.  

Get a roomba for the new place. It vacuums daily so no hair. 

Get multiple kitty scratching posts. 

And tape the things you don't want to get scratched. 


Use a water gun to keep kitty out of the bedroom 

And you're good "
"The inlaws have the title, the car is in their name. I have no idea how I would even explain to Stephanie her birthday gift needs to go back. No one wins here.  "
Is this real? He sounds like a damn mafia boss.
"It is very possible that this is an attempt to draw you out to a place where someone else has the advantage, and has a plan in place to do something. Definitely give your ex a headsup about calling the cops, and then *do it*. Your ex's safety is much more important than him *maybe* getting in trouble for having drugs in his home. "
"Good writers always write well, even when – actually especially when – they are recounting something from their own life."
"That's what I was thinking. It's enough time to finish a round of antibiotics, and then get a check up to make sure he's in the clear. "
"&gt; but she's really been driving me up the wall lately.

no, you're driving her up the wall, because you're always there. I really think that's the point of this."
"Only saw this after your edit. OP, you did not force him to say it at all. I think you should force him out of your life.

To break down the conversation:
He tried to motivate you in a negative and manipulative way, also a dishonest way (and, from someone that used to be 155 at 5'5"", nope, boobs definitely get MORE saggy-although not by much). You responded by CORRECTLY telling him that you have to be motivated to workout and lose weight for yourself. And by reminding him that you already *are*, and that he is being unreasonable with his expectations (no soda). You confided in him that his pressure makes you feel like he's not happy with you. He got defensive and played the ""get healthy"" card as if that were all there is to your body. You reminded him that you're not unhealthy, and he then resorted to calling you obese and calling you lazy. When you asked him directly whether he liked your body as it is now, he told you he hated how you look.

He is a royal lump. He's unhealthily pressuring you to lose weight or get fit. He cannot hold a reasonable conversation with you about his constant pressure, and was either telling the truth when he said he doesn't like you for how you are right now, or was so intent on being right that he said something cruel just to get you to be quiet. Either way I think you can do better."
"Agreed. OP, your bioparents have only reached out to you because their other kids went NC and they want something. They want you to shore up their egos and possibly give them money. Be wary."
"It's the Malfurion, Illidan, Tyrande love triangle all over again lol"
"So hes cheap? Im starting to think bis exs weren't gold diggers so much as didnt want to always grab the bill.  

Think hard. Youve gotten the whole bill lots and hes never done more than split it? Wtf? Hes already doing almost nothing and has the nerve to complain about it? "
"&gt;I'll admit, I started talking a lot, telling him how I felt

This is rather vague. I mean, if you wore him down and possibly cornered him into saying something, then we need you to fill in these details with everything that you said. Otherwise the advice here is moot.

That said, this ""Bobbi said her boobs used to sag, but not anymore. You don't want saggy boobs, right?"" was a bad move."
"So lets get this straight.  

- You are both impulsive.

- You moved in together after a few short months of LDR

-  Its both of your first serious relationship

-  You are both super defensive

- She loves to argue and knitpick

-  She says yelling and crying is something she needs to do

- She insists you mustnt say no to sex

- You have mismatched sex drives and she blames you

- She wont compromise or even discuss issues

- She expects you to compromise on everything.

- She talks down to you.

- She baits you into arguments / tries to trap you.

- She wont let you have space and likes to criticise you.

- She insists you shouldnt do anything other than what she wants to do.

-  She cries when you dont buy her stuff.

In conclusion - she is a spoilt, entitled brat who has you wrapped around her little finger and you are too inexperienced to know any better.

You need to run, not walk, out of this relationship."
My windows were rolled up and my doors shut. My sunroof was a tiny bit cracked so that's the only thing I can think of for how she could have heard me. I feel like she still would have had to be straining to hear me though.
"There are a couple of approaches that might be useful to you, that I can see. 

One is thinking about Emotional Intelligence. There are plenty of books about this. 

The other is thinking about therapy. It sounds to me like you are very unhappy with yourself. And that unhappiness may be keeping you so busy you don't have time to pay attention to other people's emotions. "
"This is such a middle eastern family BS line. My mom blamed her heart attack on me for the same reason. We'd been estranged for months by that point, and last I checked I don't have magical powers to inflict coronaries. It hurts like hell to hear these things because a little kid part of us will always want to be our parents' child and bring them respect and honor (thanks, conditioning) but it's not worth the personal toll it takes on you. Hang in there, OP. Things will be hard sometimes but so much calmer. We're proud of you!"
"Dude, he's four.  He's not really the one who should get to dictate the terms here, because he's not the one with the long-term perspective.  I thought my little brother was boring at the time, too.  Now, some of my favorite memories from that time period are of our parents reading to us or playing silly games as a family, and I wish there were more of those."
"Perhaps there is a lot more fear of being judged than I realized. I'm remembering now on more than one occasion he got extremely anxious/agitated when we were paying up at a restaurant and I said I was going to go wait outside because it was so hot inside. He was so worried about the waitress thinking I was storming out on him, that he begged me to stay inside, even though I was overheating like crazy."
"Lol, her telling you that she ""only wanted to talk to him out of resentment for you"" should be one of the things on the list of things you should warn your friend about before he gets involved.

I would tell her that she said this to you, and also let him know that she cheated on him in high school, and that she asked you not to tell him explicitly.

She wants to start a relationship or whatever on a series of shitty and awkward lies. I don't think it's spiteful to warn your friend."
"You pick both.

My now wife is the youngest of 7 (and has 2 older brothers). Her dad passed away a few years before we got married. She decided to have both of her brothers walk her down the aisle. Then at the wedding/reception (with the dances)- she started dancing with one of them for a song and switched up halfway through."
"Agreed. The entire team &amp; college friends will think OP is a backstabbing jackass. College is not high school, you don't lose contact with college friends like high school friends. College friends are the ones who will hook you up with jobs, share their professional development, and help you in the future. But not if they think OP is a dick. "
"If it was a year ago why didn't he delete the pictures sooner? Why were they STILL in his recently deleted photos? If he felt so bad why wouldn't he have permanently deleted them instantly? 

There are plenty of men who will make you dinner, throw sweet tarts at you, and not get blowjobs from strippers. 

I don't think he deserves you, and I don't think you deserve someone like that. You said you felt pressured to forgive him at the moment, but you need time. I'm glad you're not moving in with him for now at least."
"&gt; I might be wrong but it seems like a pretty common thing at least with the people I grew up with.

You grew up around horrible people.

&gt; I see it all the time actually, went to the convenience store last week and these three girls were bad mouthing a cashier as she checked them out.

Horrible people.

&gt; I feel like when they started saying stuff about them he should have just spoken up and been like ""Hey, I speak it or at least bring it up the second time around.""

Why? So they could pretend not to be the complete assholes they so evidently are?

&gt; I don't understand why he would willingly go through that type of abuse.

I dont understand why you would tolerate it from your friends or parents.  How incredibly disloyal of you."
"Do you put this little thought into everything you do, or just everything concerning your girlfriend? Can you say with clear conscience that you haven't been taking her for granted most of the time? I'm asking you this not to harp on you, but to get you to thinking. Many of my friends were similarly ""invested"" in their relationships, and while many got so far as to marry, they also were acting very much surprised when 5 years into the marriage, their wives left them because they reached the breaking point. In my friends minds, everything was working, so how come she left? And when you start asking questions, turns out they thought it was perfectly fine to get by on the barest of minimums. At first, your partner will take on most of the work, and will make the relationship run for the both of you. But eventually, she's going to think ""why is it always just me making it work? I'm being a chump"" and then you're sending her teary voicemails about coming back home because ""you only realized what you had when you lost it"".

Realize what you have now, while you still have it. For your own sake."
"Are you fucking nuts? Or just have such low self esteem that you can't move out of the way of a trainwreck  that is going to TOTALLY fuck up your life! Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, by In the future you're going to look around at the shambles your life has become and wish you had the guts to end it early. You're gonna be in some subreddit like /r/deadbedrooms or something, with kids and a mortgage and be all FML. Of course I could be projecting a little. But still, don't be me. "
"Yes, I thought it was the sweetest thing too! Like they've survived college and starting jobs, bodies changing and all these stressful life events that could be a death knell on so many relationships and she was so bubbly and happy to boot.

And his take away, you're right, was ""ugh fat"" from all of that- that is not nice at all like he couldn't be happy for her because she's not her high school weight. Who is?"
"I think maybe it is also that you are spending more quality time together as a couple connecting.  Cooking together or eating out.  Watching a movie TOGETHER without him ding situps (WTF is with that BTW LOL??)

Emotional intimacy for women is very important so perhaps you now have a deeper connection with him as you share more interests and are having more fun"
"That's a good point, thanks!

I'm hoping/assuming that Tim would have mentioned it to her, but I like your idea of just bringing it up to her myself now so that I've acknowledged it as well. That way, the air is fully cleared and I shouldn't have anything to worry about since the dinner went fine and we all had a good time."
"Your wife is fairly clearly ill.  Her thyroid levels and/or untreated post-partum depression are both likely culprits, but it could be something else.  Whatever it is, it's almost certainly fixable with some mixture of therapy and medication.

(I know you said her thyroid is regulated now, but thyroid levels are often quite tricky.  It can take many months of repeated tests, dosage changes, and more tests to find a good treatment regime, some people respond poorly to the most common drugs, etc.  And depending on what the underlying problem is, her levels can spike or crash from week to week.  Intermittent periods of inexplicable anger from someone with a known thyroid imbalance sounds a *lot* like an improperly treated thyroid condition.)

The problem is that any fix is going to take time and it's going to take effort and commitment from both of you, and it sounds like both of you are approaching the end of the rope.  If you'd started working on a fix when this started, you might have a chance.  Now...I dunno.  I feel like this relationship may be too far off the rails already, especially when any fix is probably going to be slow, difficult, and expensive.

Good luck, I guess?

(Edit: Her family sounds *terrible*.  I think you guys needed to cut her family out early on.  By letting her family slide *and* her early signs of anger/violence towards you, I think you've let things get waaaay too far to fix.  Sorry.)"
Sounds like an issue you should work through with your therapist.
"So there is two things here in my mind.  First quickly, my GF looks similar to the majority of the porn I look(ed) at.  This isn't an accident.  She does fit into an attraction of mine (blue eyed and blond).  That alone isnt an issue.  

There is a very real difference between ""forced/rape/brutal"" porn and bdsm.  Kink people respect and want only to support their partners in what they want, even when its rough.  Some partners want to be tied up, some partners want to tie others up.  Cutting throats can, if simulated, be a part of sadomasochism but it is very clear this isn't your thing.  

Best case he is into kink and  you are not a good partner.  Worse case he is into violence and no one is a safe partner.  Either way this is not a long term relationship for you.  "
Same... *Closes blinds*
"First, counseling, if you're not currently going.

Second, get a physical/emotional outlet for your anger. Take up kick boxing or yoga. Practice baking bread that requires lots of kneading. Throw a series of water balloon fights. Buy some plates/glass items and break them and then make art with the pieces."
"&gt; no normal person let alone a husband would kick someone hard ~~who looks ill~~

FTFY"
"Family means everything in the world.

These people aren't family."
Because those are the two correct answers.
"Get out, OP. Make your plans, don't tell him, but go. He will hurt you badly, and he will hurt the children."
My boyfriend and I make each other lunch for our work day. I work from home so he makes me one I eat at home and I make him one to take with him. One of my favorite activities of ours is in the evening making lunch for each other and just talking and laughing- recapping our day and talking about our future plans. We can't have lunch together so he says eating my lunch and knowing I'm eating his is almost like being able to be together.
"All young women need to find their ""no,"" and I hope after this experience it's easier for you to do so. We're raised, whether conciously or not, to be polite, to not ruffle feathers, to not want to look hypocritical or mean. We need to be nice. I think this has the unfortunate result of many women not knowing how to be comfortable with saying ""no.""

I also think it takes us a number of instances of other people, often men, crossing boundaries, and when we look back later, we realize those things were totally not okay and we had every right to say no and why didn't we do it sooner?

One of those instances for me was when I was about sixteen and a middle-aged man at my school put his hand on my lower back as I bent over a table to sign something... and he left it there. Years later I still think, why the hell did he think he had any right to touch me that way? I wish I'd have called him on it. But I hadn't found my ""no"" yet.

Find your ""no,"" and don't be afraid to use it. Trust your gut."
"I think the point is that, while his stepmother betrayed her own morals and behaved objectively morally badly, she's not the one who broke faith with the OP. They were both part of the act, sure, but even if she was the most morally bankrupt gold digger of all time, actively seeking out a married man to ""steal"", it wouldn't have been possible without OP's dad cheating, prioritizing the relationship above his family, divorcing OP's mom and marrying his affair partner. *These* are the tangible betrayals the OP has experienced, and they were completely within his *father's* control. So, while each party may be equally morally ""guilty"" in the affair, the hurt to OP specifically is on Dad. It could have been her, or it could have been another woman, and the result would be the same. She's just a convenient peg to hang all the blame on because it's  (understandably) easier than recognizing his dad's culpability."
Never move in with someone because it's convenient. Only move in with them because you and they in your relationship are ready for it. That's not the case with you at all.
"This isn't normal. For women, showering before bed is a massive pain. Especially if your hair requires any kind of maintenance. I *hate* showering before bed, because I try to make my hairstyles last 2-3 days, and even with a shower cap, the shower humidity destroys it.

Honestly, the way you live your life is not reasonable or manageable longterm. When you have babies, do you expect your wife not to breast-feed in bed? Are you going to demand that your three year old who has the stomach flu showers before he slips into bed with you?

I think your time and energy would be better spent on getting over your phobia of unshowered bodies in bed rather than nagging your girlfriend over this triviality. Or sleep in separate rooms."
Yeah actually this is probably the best idea. Since she hasn't responded to an actual adult conversation (and I'm really creeped out by that--I can't believe she responded that way--totally inappropriate) there's no choice but to fight fire with fire. 
"I like this approach.  Hard to be angry with you. But you will also get to see their true colors when they try to persuade you otherwise.  Like it or not OP, your life has changed and your relationships have changed.  "
"This would be a dealbreaker for me. I have been impatient with my partner, but not like that! And now she won't even try to attempt Portal with me again. So it goes. If he knew it was you, holy shit. If he didn't know it was you... well, what the fuck."
"Get your mom resources for victims of abusive relationships, and flood her with the testimony from children of verbally abusive fathers. /r/raisedbynarcissists members might be willing to give you/your mom a good idea of their experiences as the ""black sheep"" and what that did to their relationship with the abuser *and* the enabler.

Hopefully your mother will realize she should be **far more afraid of losing her daughter** (no contact is the best possible outcome, but suicide is a serious risk) than losing her abusive, manipulative husband."
"Omg girl, you don't see this as Gary liking you?! Leave that boy alone and let him just be friends with your man. It's not that he truly hates you it sounds like he is trying to respect the relationship without crossing any boundaries with you. Why would Gary say to Jay, yea i helped you guys meet but I really love her. I don't know too many guys that would go and admit that to their friend that they like their girlfriend. Some people can be around the one they like/love and pretend that everything is okay and others have a hard time seeing the person they think got away. Everyone's different. I get its annoying because you don't want to believe thats the reason, but just reading this it sounds like it. "
"He's sorry that your anger makes him sad not that he hurt you OP. He's feeling sorry for himself but not his actions. It didn't just happen it was a series of choices he made (stone cold sober) with no regard for you or the releationship. Hes sorry your mad at *him* that's the only thing he cares about, Himself."
[removed]
You purposefully misinterpreted and mis-characterized what I said. What's worse is you went through the trouble of creating a throwaway account for such poor execution. Your time could've been much better spent elsewhere.
Tickling has been used as a form of torture. You were not overreacting. 
And boy are my fingers tired!
"Piggybacking here to address OP's husband, and I hope others can back me up, but MEN FREQUENTLY ACT THIS WAY TOWARD WOMEN WITHOUT PROVOCATION. It's a cultural thing, it's entitlement, and it's totally common.

Women can do everything they ""should"" do when it comes to unwanted advances--what OP lists here is nigh-perfect behavior--and men can still react with anything from not believing/respecting a ""no"" (because women ""just play hard to get"", right?) to escalating. And sure, ""not all men"", but that has nothing to do with the men like Dave who are so goddamned common that they may as well be a storytelling trope themselves (if more women were in charge of what stories get told, anyway).

OP's husband: please listen to women's accounts. Please listen to *your wife*. I don't know why you'd want to believe shirtless playboy Dave over her, when you must know he's probably pulling the same sort of shit with the women he brings home. You think a single one of them knows she's part of a revolving door play?"
"Exactly this. She wants a cat...fine. She keeps the cat at her place. Since she brought the cat into your place, she has decided to move out. Does not mean you have to break up, but that is likely how she will react.

But you really must hold firm and not allow her to step all over you. Next, she's going to want kids..."
"Well, abs are made in the gym, but they're revealed in the kitchen."
That was my first thought. Would he have even considered her if she had a child out of wedlock?
What about this? Fuck I hate when people comment like this. It adds nothing.
"That isn't healthy or normal behavior. 

  I'm also guessing, since the sister is overly sexual, that she may have been groomed by the older family to think the inappropriate contact is okay. I would sit down and have a serious talk with your bf about how that type of behavior is making you feel uncomfortable. His reaction should tell you if you should keep seeing this guy."
"The way he talks about your genitals makes it seem like he's never seen any in real life before you. 

I'm definitely on the dump-train on this one. Even if you aren't insecure about that stuff, it seems that he's trying to MAKE you insecure. Horrible person trying to fill your head with garbage. "
My husband's an atheist &amp; you know what he does when my step-mother is saying grace? He sits there in silence until she's finished. Because he's an adult. Kevin is an idiot.
"I'm sorry you're going through this. I feel bad for him, too, assuming this truly is as far as it's ever gone (ie, absolutely no inappropriate contact with children, no child pornography, etc.). As far as I know, it is not a crime to write fiction like this. 

But the pregnancy puts a WHOLE other spin on it. You must take steps now to protect your child. If possible, get documentation of all this - write down the date, duration and summary of his conversation with you and if you can, get access to and save the writings. You will need to seek out sole legal custody of your child, preferably before s/he is born, to ensure he does not have access. I believe that, if you were happy about the pregnancy originally, you'll find you still want ""his"" baby especially because he will not be involved. Of course, abortion is also an option and you should talk to a trusted friend or family member, or Planned Parenthood, about that - how long you have to make the decision, etc. 

I'd contact a lawyer and take his or her advice on what else you can do. Good luck, OP."
Grandma has sure as fuck been meddling
Exactly. Try to be kind.
"SUCH good advice.  The segregation that OP is doing is going to great a divide and jealousy even more between the kids, and it's going to make it very hard for him to bond with the baby.  Most kids are jealous when a new sibling comes along...they almost all get used to it and adjust, IF the parents make a concerted effort to create a FAMILY group.  Kids don't always have to feel singularly special and it's actually unhealthy for them to think so.  It's more important for them to realize that the family has value as a whole, they have value as having a place in that family in relation to the others, and they also have value as an individual."
"I'm sorry, but changing diapers and doing night wake-ups isn't a selling point. It's the bare minimum as a parent. Your husband, a grownass 34 year old man, risked the life of your baby and every other baby at that library meetup just because he didn't want to do the bare fucking minimum and get vaccinated. This could've not only killed your son, but other parents' children as well if he was a carrier. He also lied to your face about this and did ALL of this knowing just how bad whooping cough is for babies.  "
"&gt; My dad has told me over and over that he just takes the easy path with Jamie because any sort of confrontation, gentle or otherwise, doesn't work. I asked my husband just now, and he said, ""Everything you say to him has to be calculated, no matter how benign it seems - you have to think about it first."" So if he wants to take photos, we do it.

So you've taken a group effort at enabling his behavior?  You dont have to confront him, but you certainly shouldnt let your food get cold so he can get his photo-rocks off.

There is literally no reason to take family photos if you arent going to share them with at least one person.  Maybe one, or two photos for your self, but dozens of photos of multiple events over the course of years?  Weird.  Where are these photos?  Where do they go after he's done with them?  Is it a perfectionist thing?

Withholding photos of your terminally ill mother is a terrible thing to do, and he should at least be told about it.  If its NPD, then he most likely thinks the photos are his and his alone.  If thats the case, you shouldnt need to pose for more, nor expect to see any of your moms photos."
Before yesterday happened I could have confidently given him an ultimatum because I believed he would have chosen me no question but right now he is not even making an effort for us to make up after he defended her so I am scared I will be the one he will decide to get rid of :( 
"&gt;I’m still really upset that it happened but I’m glad that they are making it right. He should have dealt with it a lot better but I’m not going to call off our engagement and end our 4 year relationship because of a poor judgement call.

Nobody asked you to break up with him over a garden. They asked you to do so because of his reaction to destroying your garden and  because you seemed scared to demand he fix it because it might ""upset him"". That is not a relationship you want to turn into a marriage.

Good on his friends for taking responsibility and fixing it though. Now it's time for you to fix yourself and stop being a doormat."
"I know why we say this all the time in this sub, but I think in this case it is different. She is invested. She made a commitment to this man. He needs help. She can work with him to get help. Sometimes relationships take work. It's not always a sunk cost to help the person you love."
"Now that you are aware, you have to address it with *her*, not with us. 

If you try to ignore it and you *hope* that she isn't doing anything any longer, you will still obsess about it and it will eat away at you. You are aware now, so it's time to put the cards on the table. "

"I think your plan to tell parents is a good one. Let them deal with it. Also, hooray for GF being sensible"
"He doesn't want to move forward with you. Three years is a long time, and his excuses about why he doesn't want to live with you are very silly and transparent. He's happy the way things are and won't even dignify you with an honest answer about a time frame.

If you want to keep dating him and are happy with your relationship as is, then keep dating him. If you want someone you can live with, marry, have children with, then move on."
But a stranger that she'll leave for the parents to deal with :/
"I'm surprised your sibs don't feel the same way - do they live closer or know her better than you do?

Were I in your shoes, I'd probably say, ""Nancy, I feel like I hardly know you.  Let's give it some time to get comfortable.  Please don't touch my belly again or I'll snap that hand right off.  You and dad seem so happy.  I'm glad you're so nice.  But my kids have a Nana already.  I appreciate your efforts.""  

So like... compliment sandwich it but also make it clear that you are uncomfortable.  This isn't about you not liking her, it is about you being uncomfortable.  "
"He's not your boyfriend, he's a predator.

You also probably aren't bi, maybe you are maybe you aren't.  This isn't how you are supposed to figure that out.  A lot of women like that stuff because it's actually marketed to women as opposed to regular porn which is intended for men.

The fact that he's trying to trick you into it because you are inexperienced and want to please him should be criminal.

Get away from him before you lose so much of yourself that you can't leave.

"So her daughter is only against strangers that are willing to open their homes to a baby out of love, but not against strangers that she hires to care for her baby full-time while she's out of the country. Oh yes, that makes perfect sense.

And I'm terrified that someone is going to ask why I was looking at gay porn at work. And all I wanted to do was show this guy a picture of a corgi dressed like Harry Potter. Stupid dropped 'the'. "
Harsh but fair. Who wants to be with someone who is going to break the back of a poor camel just to try and win an argument with their partner?
"&gt; How do I make it 100% clear to him that we are not getting back together after this? What do I do if he denies the incident altogether or says that he doesn't remember it? What do I say if he tries to blame it on the alcohol? 

Tell him that it's over then have all communication go through lawyers. Make an email folder and reroute all of his messages to go into it so that you don't have to see them, but you have it if you need it. Keep your phone so that you have the proof of his voice mails, but get yourself a new number for actual use. If you're renting, see what needs to happen for you to break the lease. 

Never be alone with him again. He sexually assaulted your friend- you can't put it past him to sexually assault you. When you move, don't tell him where you're going. Tell as few people as possible. If you're in a situation for example where you own the home you're in and you have to stay in the home, change the locks on the doors (consult with your lawyer on when you can do this) and set up nannycams. 

What he says doesn't matter. If you decide that you're not opening the table for conversation, then it's not opening. Focus less on trying to talk him into agreeing to divorce and more on what you need to legally do to file for divorce. 

Make sure you warn your friend all of this is happening. He might become physically violent with her if he blames her for you leaving him. "

"You pay off his epic debt, he stops paying attention to you, isn't even nice for you, has no time for you and you're still hanging about?

You already know what's going on: He doesn't care about you except for you money and now he has no motivation to pay attention to you. I bet you $100 he is fucking someone else. Hire a PI and see.

Break up and use your money to ruin him."

Let people think what they want to think. Sounds like you have a great guy and are happy. Fuck everyone else! Maybe you could come up with some smart ass remarks and be funny about it if anyone says anything to you. Embrace it and be happy!
"I'm going to pretend this is real for a minute.

I'd say this isn't salvageable, but the only way to know would be to speak with him about it. I don't even think there *is* a way to justify something like that. If he thought it was good for your skin, God forbid, he still should've asked.

It's not like you're never going to speak with him again. You'll have to, even if it's just to cancel the wedding arrangements, if they've been made, and move out. Take a day or two to yourself at a friend or family member's place and text him to meet up when you've gathered your thoughts and know what to do."
"&gt; Are you sure this is about your husband wanting to give your other daughter 12k or more about him not wanting to spend the money on your daughters eye surgery in the first place?

He's happy to pay for the surgery, it was actually his idea to pay for it and we are both on board. 

I suspect it has more to do with the fact that he grew up his parents 'least favourite child' and has a bit of a chip on his shoulder about it. He is concerned we are doing the same to Pippa, but I think at 24, Pippa is old enough to understand that paying for a medical expense for a child that needs it doesn't mean Kate is ""more loved"" or the ""favourite""."

"Your mom is not overreacting, the girl is. She should apologize for not understanding, and after two years, she should have before and you should have had this conversation before.

She essentially said she does not care if you brings mortal danger into your life. Who needs friends like that ?

Fact she used almonds in your house is a massive red flag in and of itself, fact she did not apologize and is now sulking is a giant dealbreaker to me.

By the way you are 30 years old, don't discuss your relationship with your mum. No matter how this turns out, you could well discuss a future girl with your mother and a few days later have everyone over for dinner."
"Saying that you WOULD do yard work if you had a yard, so therefore it's okay for her to do all the housework is a ridiculous argument. 

She gets ""worked up"" because she's doing all the work. Everyone has some chores they are particular about (like laundry) but there are a lot of chores that need to be done. Can you cook? Can you wash dishes? Can you clean the bathroom?

You need to be a partner and help maintain the household by doing what needs to be done. It's fine to both do different things but it's not okay for you to do nothing. "
$150 vase is nothing compared to knowing that your boyfriend is cheating on you.  Also let her know he's trying to blackmail you.  This guy is a douche.
"Oh my word, my same thought. I would have honed in on this like a sniper. My husband once dropped me for another girl before we had even started dating, in the ""talking"" phase. When, a year later, we actually got together and the girl texted him congrats, i was with him and her number wasn't even saved to his phone. He had also already unfriended her on facebook, without ever telling me and without me asking. I knew she was absolutely a thing of the past. OP, why did he have her number still?? If he felt ""so guilty"" why wouldn't he have deleted her from his life in disgust?"
"One option could be to have someone in your family fake an emergency - anything that would create a need for you to travel to 'visit' them and be there to help. You can use this as a cover to get out without him questioning it and then, once you're gone, just don't go back. 

I work with survivors of violence and I agree with what everyone else has said here - his behaviors are abusive, and typically situations like this only escalate. Take care of yourself - you deserve SO much better than this!"
"Eh it was a private jet, that dog lived better than I did.  "
"&gt;he stuck to his decision and didn't use it against you in any way

OP, this is a very good point. Yes, he could have told you sooner, but based on your post, there were several chances he could have called out your friends or family members in regards to them badmouthing him. Regardless of if he could understand them or not, it is extremely rude to speak ill of someone right in front of them. You can have your own opinion about someone, but to do so in front of them is disrespectful.

Another thing to consider is that your fiance must have had an extremely close relationship with his mother to completely stop speaking a language, despite people looking down on him for not knowing that part of his heritage. That being said, he broke out of his comfort zone to propose to you in Korean. He must love you very much.

If you're really concerned about your fiance having lied by omission for the sake of gaining an advantage over you, ask him what else he's hidden.

Edit: Spelling. "

"Not even close to the same horrific situation, but some years back a co-worker of mine found that change was disappearing out of his desk drawer overnight.  He set up a web-cam and a program for motion-sensor recording in an out-of-the-way part of his office, and two days later had video of one of the night cleaning staff coming in, dusting his desk, lifting a few coins, and walking out.

It sounds like the company is taking this seriously, and you should certainly not have to change jobs because of someone else's abhorrent behavior.

Im going to tell you this, as a strong-headed man of similar age.  Stop meddling in his affairs and stop siccing other relatives on him.  He is not some child you can boss around.  Frankly, being an anti-poaching bush pilot is an incredibly honorable and bad-ass occupation.  

Its a hell of a lot better than whatever dead-end job you have in store for him back home.  You did do this right?  I know you arent asking someone to move across the country without any sort of means to support himself?  Or are you going to take him in and feed and cloth him for the rest of his life?

Did you ever stop and think he might actually be having fun out there?  That he really enjoys what he is doing?  And that, by meddling, you are ruining his life?  The great thing about being an adult is doing the things that he does, without hindrance or meddling relatives. He is *FREE.*  And you, by your interference, are screwing with that.

"If you tell him he can keep the money, he will use it against you in court, if you plan on suing him. Maybe offer to do a payment plan. I suspect he spent it on drugs or something."

"I'm going to weigh-in and say that I would lean more towards this being involuntary because of this:

&gt;One time I pointed out to him that he had said it in front of me and he was genuinely surprised like he didn't realise I could hear.

I had a friend in high school that said **everything** he thought. Like to the point that when he was upset at me, and trying to give me the silent treatment (you know: cold stare, tight lips), he would start telling me about how and why either I was being an asshole or he didn't want to admit to being wrong.

I don't know if he was ever diagnosed with anything since we drifted after high school, however he seemed truly surprised when I would address his ""thoughts"". He truly believed he was thinking the things he was saying. To the point of turning beat red one time when he wanted to think to himself ""Damn, she's fine. I want to make her mine."" about some girl (who was, admittedly, very fine) in the cafeteria. Except he said it very enthusiastically and at higher than normal conversation volume. Was hilarious, and he had no idea he was the reason everyone in the vicinity got quite until the girl asked him what he said.  "
"I commend you for saying he was having an emotional affair but reality is he was having an affair.

He took her out on dates, went to her house, showed her all the attention he was supposed to be showing you.

How are you ever supposed to believe they never did anything?  The idea that he didn't is unfortunately not based in reality due to his actions.

It's likely she's protecting him by saying they never slept together.

This is where you need to decide if this is forgivable because I have no idea how you could ever trust him again."

"John is really great. He's been so wonderful to me and I'm very thankful that he's in my life.

I do still want a mother/daughter relationship, which is a keen observation. I sometimes like to pretend that I'm okay without one. Though my mother in law is also wonderful and is so excited to have a daughter to do things with, which has made me very happy.

"He's not just having trouble with empathy. That's hilarious. There's a difference between feeling something and saying something. He is actively and repeatedly saying cruel things to OP. Treating her like an object isn't just an empathy issue, it's one of control. There's no way he hasn't done this to other women. That's a way you view the role of your girlfriend.

Of course it's sexist. He's participating in, and has been affected by, a culture that says women are property. If you cant see that then I'd say you have a hard time comprehending that sexism (like racism, like homophobia) doesn't have to be explicit to be legitimate.

Although I think this case is fairly explicit.

"For your child's safety you cannot just leave this alone. Because of your bedrest and medical drama, he has decided that he doesn't have to care, because you are stuck with him. I'm sorry to say this, but your weight gain may also be causing him to devalue you. 

Let me make this clear: your child is being neglected physically and emotionally. Be honest with yourself. What is going to happen when there are two tiny children, one of whom is a newborn, entirely dependent on him? 

How do you see things going when he goes back to work? Will he be able to hold onto his job? Are you ready to spend the next 18 years as a single parent with a roommate? 

You absolutely have to solve this. Nothing will change until you take action. Somebody who is cutting themselves off from everybody in their life is not doing well, and nothing is going to magically happen where he wakes up one day and says ""I am so wrong! I will start being a great father and partner now!"" In fact, I predict that things will only get worse. 

A condo is not a prison. If you need to leave, you get a lawyer, assert your rights, and he either buys you out, you buy him out, or you both sell the place. You also get a child support agreement in place. Do this through the courts, not by informal agreement. 

That is the only thing that has a chance of waking him up put of his stupor. Even then, he may not get it. 

You are a mother. Your children come first. He is choosing not to be a father. Don't gloss over this or defend him or your children will hold you equally responsible. "

"This is a tricky situation and I assume the majority of r/relationships will tell you to tell the mother. Don't do that, she'll just confront the kids and they'll dislike you more.

"Black woman here. Really, the only thing close to a racist connotation I can think of with ""mama bear"" is when they'd have older black female slaves babysit their children back in the day. Google ""mammy archetype"" to see what I mean. And even that's a stretch, in my opinion.

Either she's dealing with some kind of mental issue, or she's got some shit going on at home. Maybe she feels insecure about herself for whatever reason - she jumped in to defend a coworker, then turns around and decides to choke the life out of another? Wut.

Either way, I just wanted to reassure you that you did *nothing* racist. I know the media's beating that horse to death these days, but whatever is going on with you that she felt she had to attack you, it has nothing to do with you. Painting you as a racist is likely a cover up for something else."

"I don't wish to encourage you.  19 out of 20 detoxifications fail even at the best centers.  That's because concerned family members can force a relative into a detoxification they don't want and they're not ready for.  Or the court system sends them in.  Or they do so to try to retain custody of their kids.  Lots of reasons.

Ultimately, the reason to go through with a detox and a rehab is because you know you no longer have a choice.  There's a line in the meetings of the fifth season of *The Wire*.  Talking about, ""Man, God made getting high just like getting perfect.  I know I've got one more high in me.  But I don't know if I have one more recovery.""  You never forget how glorious it was to be able to have chemical relief.  Even non-addicts occasionally remember positively how giggly they felt after having wisdom teeth extracted or tonsils removed.  But they don't crave it the way an addict does.

But the situation doesn't bias anything favorably here, either.  She's 25, so I don't know if she's got her own insurance through work or her parents or she's on one of the exchanges, but your chances are most likely, if you can get her to go at all, a brief detoxification (I think I was in detoxification for a week) with a discharge to either a rehabilitative clinic or a day program for 30 days.

But sobriety gets really hard not at the 30 days, or fresh out of rehab.  It gets really hard about three, six months in.  You're sober and to all of your friends and loved ones, you look like you're doing okay.  A bit worn down, but that's understandable.  And, thank God, it worked.

It's around the three month to six month mark that you realize this isn't a diet to lose 15 pounds where you cut something out for the short term.  That this isn't a gym going thing so that you can reach a certain measure on the bench press.   Yeah, you've gone through cutting out something you really liked.  You've gone through doing stupid exercises just so you could meet a standard.

In other words, there is no relief ahead of you.  There's no, ""Congrats, you lost those 20 pounds you've been wanting to lose.  Let's go grab an ice cream sundae"" option.  I mean, it's not like you're six months sober and people take you out for a ""special treat"" of a night of some really good heroin to smoke.  

People who let themselves believe they had to make it so far, and now they just need one break, and they can go back to keep on making it, are doomed.  

That hurts on a screaming, shattering level.  We can delay gratification as humans quite well, but forgoing an earthly ecstacy is a harsh standard to apply upon oneself for what would certainly appear to be the rest of one's life.

There's some research out there on ""moderation management"" with problem drinkers, where some of them genuinely learn another way to handle alcohol on a social-only level, and avoid all of their problematic personal interactions.  For one thing, it gives a committed alcoholic a group to pace off of.  If someone's at the table has gone through half a glass of wine over two courses, then you let it go and drink at the same speed.  But drinking is almost always social.  Getting high was social for a lot of people, but it's not a positive sociability.

For the rest of us?  My friends aren't going to decide to put out ""Something absolutely sinful and addictive, but I got just a tiny amount of it"" at a dinner party.  Or, rather, they will.  It will be dark chocolate-covered French candy.  

Those people I've been studiously avoiding because I know they'll nag me about getting together, like the old days?  They might put out a treat, too.  And it'd be some dope.  But since my friends and family know I'm getting sober, this definitely has to be a one-time thing.

Hmm.  A secret gathering in which you use drugs and no one has any contact with the people who are trying to help you live your life sober.  There's absolutely no problems with that, aye.  Oh, except that suddenly, you'll find a way to be able to see them.  I mean, not all the time.  But you missed the conversation (or so you tell yourself) and are dying for another one of those get-togethers — the description of steampunk philosophy probably could be done another way, but your family and friends have made it clear to stay away from the drug friends.  (They assess, correctly, that you are the problem both with them and without them.  They don't blame the friends, but they sure blame the person you are whenever you're with them.)  So, future meetings have to be on the d-l, hope no one minds, yeah, it's insane, I get it.

Yeah, dealing with your life sober sucks.  That's how you figured out drugs were a relief.  Are you going to take the steps necessary to make your sober life change so you don't feel you need the drugs?  That's most certainly a possibility.  And by making a major change, especially if you're obtaining drugs illegally, that could involve moving to a new area and finding a place where you weren't so bored and restless and sad.

I can speculate until the cows come home, but ultimately, your girlfriend needs a good therapist who knows what's up to help her pull apart exactly what's ailing her, you need the ability to speak to an addiction therapist, and you need to call local detoxification centers and ask about admissions."
"Mentally ill people acting out sexually is a thing that happens.  It's actually pretty common. Not necessarily what's happening here, or a good reason for him to stay. People tend to be better, kinder versions of themselves when they're happy. They are less impulsive without stress and anxiety. Medication doesn't create a moral center but it makes it easier for people to be the best version themselves."
"Ask him about the risk factor in driving an old car with 200,000 miles on it.  Was he going to wait for it to break down and strand you with the children?"
"If you were a priority to him, he's make the time to be with you. You're not. This isn't going to work out. "
"Maybe I'm missing something here, but this doesn't make immediate sense... Why on earth can't you just stay in touch with your siblings independently?

Do they all live with your mom? If not, why you can't see them on your own?

I say this as someone who cut my father out of my life for years but stayed in close touch with my brother..."
So I'm not the only one who thinks a 16 year old being on Tinder is a very bad idea then.
"okay, thank you so much for your help, I'll get to the ER asap."
"You said he lifts. Could he possible be taking steroids? If so, he could have roid rage. No excuse for his behavior of course. "
"THIS OP! Except DO it, if you can. Put downposits on the vacation so it is not available for them.

Anything that is available, just lie and say it isn't. Or don't lie...but maintain it is not available to them. They don't have the right to your money.

Tell your husband that he is not helping them by giving them money. He's enabling their irresponsible behavior. They need to learn how to live within their means...bailing them out will not do that. If they must, they can look into getting a small loan...which they must pay back because banks cannot be guilt-tripped like adult children."
"Obviously nothing's absolute, but here's what we have: 

* sketchy thing
* op demands explanation
* fiance: ""I can't right now, just give me a couple weeks.. please don't tell my mother"", obfuscating some of the specifics because if she goes ahead and tells her anyway, it won't blow the girls' cover. 
* op immediately directly contravenes her fiance's wishes. 

She should have just bit her tongue for a couple weeks, presuming she trusts him, and waited for the explanation. I'd have a hard time thinking that's how a cheater would behave. And if that's not good enough for you? You talk to *him*, not go on a fishing expedition with mom, you know, the *only person on the planet* he asked her not to say anything to. "
He'd rather be miserable and married than _have to leave the house_. Not you. Not his marriage. Not the children. The house.
"OP already claims (I write claims, because there's always ways to make a trip cheaper - 4 per room, use air bnb instead of hotel, eat pizza instead of restaurants......) she can't afford to send all 3 girls to NYC, so  a second trip isn't really an option.

Op will have to have an embarrassing conversation with Ellie and Nicole where they may get upset with her, but it's the right thing to do for Christina."
He's manipulative and controlling. I think OP needs to have a serious talk with him about this. Maybe he's got some insecurities too. 
"&gt;I would give her a date to move out

I'd take it a step farther and file an eviction notice.

That way, if she doesn't want to move out by the end of the 30 days, you can simply get the Sheriff to kick her out. Why waste time having her potentially stay there still then having to give her an extra 30 days to file the eviction?"
"&gt; My mistake.

Why is it *your* responsibility to make sure nobody does something that will make your mom uncomfortable when it's *her* insecurities? It should have been hers. Why are you running around playing mediator as though the parents involved need a middle man? I think it's first and foremost your mom's mistake. Then maybe it's yours (I'm not convinced you *should* be responsible just saying). Your stepmom is innocent in this. So you can see why your dad thinks it's sorta unfair. This is going to sound bad but but don't coddle your mom. She can fight her own battles."
"Yup! Many posts.. ""My boyfriend won't fuck me, but he jerks of 2-4x a day to porn, but he says that's different and totally normal and had nothing to do with his low libido."""
"This is spot on.

I would send all four of these greedy fuckos an email saying this -- the only thing I would change is to make ""gracious"" into ""understanding"" (because I hate when people call themselves ""gracious"", just seems a bit obnoxious -- that may just be me).  "
"Anger management and therapy. Now. There is only so much you can do. He has to do the work to help himself. He has issues and needs to work through them and not pass it on to the next generation. 

If he is a good loving father and husband, he will do the work and with you learn how to manage with coping strategies and over coming his issues. "
YEAH more doggo pics are always welcome!
"I would guess that perhaps they changed the name and you weren't updated, or the original name was a ruse to get people from asking, or using the name that they had picked out together would have been painful to use, as it would be a constant reminder that her husband is not here to see the baby being born and raised. Maybe she needed to use a fresh name that didn't have any connotations. 

"
"Yeah, I feel really bad for OP because he seems to think his mother is being so generous by letting her underage children live with her. That's basic parenting. Having to have sex earlier in the evening is not the biggest lifestyle change parents have to make."
"The good news for you is that you have learned and will continue to learn valuable life skills. 

Your parents don't seem to realize that they are making it easier for your sister to avoid learning those skills. 

In the future when you remember your wedding I bet you will feel good about the fact that you paid for the whole thing yourselves. "
"He's right that it's not a very big deal.

It is a deal valued at approximately $50.

That's a smaller deal than a nice dinner or a night of drinking. 

If he can't take responsibility for a deal that small, he seems like a pretty useless guy. I'd say the friendship is already over."
"I've questioned whether our friend's claim that Gary is in love with me is a possibility, but there were several years where I was single and Gary had a chance to ask me out if he really liked me more than a friend (I never suspected he did). He even suggested Jay and I go out on a date when he first introduced us. Before Gary started acting this way, whenever all of us would hang out, I made sure Gary did not feel like a third wheel and gave him lots of attention as a friend."
"Ask him why this bothers him. He needs to realize that this is *his* problem, not a general problem. Since it's only his issue, he needs to get over it without confusing everyone else. He's 26, he can't expect you to coddle him over something like this. He needs to speak to his therapist about this, and you shouldn't budge on it. Good luck!"
"It depends on the person, but it can be weeks or days. It's subtle at first, building slowly to a crescendo as in a roller coaster... And then suddenly down you go. Depression.

The best part is while they have fun with mania generally neither phase is pleasant to be around.

""Why? Why *fifty* puzzles? No, you're never going to finish those, *stop that.* how much money did you spend?!"""
"I'm reading it as: girlfriend had an ex that pushed boundaries with her or who she gave into for whatever reason despite her own preferences. She and this guy split, she manages to set those boundaries with her next partner (OP). OP finds this out about her past and instead of saying ""Oh yikes, I know my GF isn't into those things. That must have been a rough time for her."" (Or better yet: ""This is none of my fucking business."") He goes on a dick comparison spree and is mad that *he* wasn't allowed to trample over his gf's feelings like the ex was. 

Sounds like he did her a favor. "
I am so sorry. I lost my brother some months back too. I think it's a sweet meaningful gesture to name your future son after him. 
I agree. I immediately suspected sexual abuse. That's my gut feeling from reading this.
"You're missing something very important:

What you want for the future: Marriage, kids, dogs.
What he wants for the future: No marriage, no kids, no dogs.

You two are not compatible to be in a relationship.  It can NEVER work between you two because you can't ever be on the same team when you want two entirely different things.  I'd suggest ending things, moving home for a bit (back with you dog) and figuring out what you want.  But you cannot make a relationship with this man work and be happy.

Talk to your parents, and ask if they will help you pay to move back home."
"Sure, but he might be able to. Just out of curiosity, what language is it? I speak Tamil - which is, IMO, much harder than, say, Hindi for native English speakers to learn - but certainly nowhere near impossible!"
"The other thing there is that ""unattracted to each other"" and ""still have sex multiple times a week"" aren't usually related phrases.  

Maybe they just have high libidos and this is the best option they have to express their physical needs, but I'm not so sure.  It's pretty difficult to have sex multiple times a week when there's no attractive.  Maybe they're both just mistaking ""attraction"" for ""holy shit I want to rip her clothes off and savage her right now.""  

Attraction can be a more routine thing, and that's not so bad."

"Landlord here. Deal directly with the landlord.

You have kind of shafted Michael so I get why he is being difficult, but you need to get out of this as best you can."
That's the same thing my ex used to tell me and that would be his time to engage and find other girls to live out his fetish. 
"It's sad that you've given such excellent advice here, because all OP is looking for is someone to validate his behavior... Which is not right and potentially harmful. I sincerely hope he takes what you've written to heart. "
"Too soon, man. Too soon. "
"Oh man, so many people here didn't read your original post. Of course she doesn't want to 'debate' with you. It gets exhausting. The name calling isn't fair, but after a certain point people get tired of having *your* opinions blasted at them. The world isn't all about you, and so her resentment built up to the point where she lashed out at you.

Just don't talk opinions with her. If you know it causes issue, keep it to yourself. Go join a group that shares your common interest if you want to talk about it, or make friends that actively want to debate politics or religion. She is not that person."
"I trade my brain in for money every day but I still think my brain is pretty important. 

Dealbreakers are dealbreakers but I think it's pointless to try to justify this as ""Having ever held X job means X characteristic.""--especially when it's a 7-month stint when broke. Hell, you have to spend a million years in law school to get a law degree, but I still probably wouldn't break up with someone if I found out they had been a lawyer, even though someone who is a lawyer is evidently someone who thinks the law isn't important, since they are willing to trade their expertise in it for money. 

If a person has X characteristic, address the characteristic. "
"My father gave my older brother a black eye when he was five years old, and my mother was pregnant with me.  She had left him alone with him for just a little while, and he claimed it was an accident.  When I was less than a year old, and my father was taking care of me while my mother was working, he gave me a concussion.  Again, he said it was an accident.  

Not surprisingly, he was violent towards my mother, but she claimed she never thought he was hurting us, until we were old enough to tell her what was happening.  I love my mother, but I still harbor resentment and sadness towards her about how long it took for her to protect us and leave my father.  Every time she tries to give me parenting advice, or we get into an argument, I think about how she ignored the signs and stayed with my father for another ten years, and though I've been through years of therapy, I still can't completely let go of the anger.

Maybe your husband can change through therapy, but if there's any chance that he's going to hurt you or your children in the meantime, please make your safety the priority."
"I didn't find a shred of remorse here for you trying to get them arrested, trying to kill an animal, being a bully, lying continually, and the many other disturbing things you have written here. Honestly, you don't sound like a good person. 

You did keep them from being able to retire with money and have another child, among other things. That's just the hard honest truth. 

Maybe they aren't good people, either. Who knows. You don't have to help them, but it looks like you have learned literally nothing from anything you have been through. Maybe that is just your writing style. Who knows. This post just made me sad. 

"
"You're getting a tiny taste of what it's like to move through life as a visible minority. No wonder you feel bad! You're seeing your community in a new and somewhat unpleasant light which is very uncomfortable. Also, you're getting a kind of attention that you probably never have before as a white dude. 

Still, you want to be supportive and you recognize that asking her to stop wearing hijab because of your feelings isn't really appropriate. It's not the fabric you hate, right? It's the reaction of your community? So be honest and accurate about your feelings. Use I-statements. ""I hate the way everyone is reacting to your hijab."" ""It made me feel awkward and shitty that my family made jokes about your hijab."" ""I'm getting a lot of weird questions and I wish people would cut it out."" That kind of thing.

Your heart is in the right place. You can support her and also be honest about the weirdness you're feeling. Just make sure she knows you're not interested in telling her what to wear and that weird comments from strangers and work acquaintances aren't more important to you than her choices. "
"&gt;I had a third date with a boy

When you're calling a 25 year old man a boy, it's probably time to take a pass. Pretty sure you didn't even do that on purpose.

&gt;'maybe I should be going home with her'

Perception: He's the cool, somewhat older unattainable man

Reality: Sure he's single, but it isn't because he's cool and unattainable, yo"
"If this subreddit has taught me anything it's that, in addition to what you have stated, he could be projecting as well.

He is being unrealistic with forms of evidence.  If OP stated that her mom was a magical dragon, I could see his point...but I'm pretty sure she's not...but it would be cool."
"Don't be so wishy washy. You are sending her mixed signal. It is like ""I only want you to if you want to, but if you don't want to then I won't force you....""

She may think this relationship isn't as important to you. You need to fight for her even now she is busy with school. 

Frankly, what's done is done and she doesn't want counselling. I don't see how you can change it.  "
"Honestly, I think you can be up front about this.  Tell her that you didn't tell her about this job because A) it's none of her business and B) the last time you did, she applied for it too, and got the job.  Why would you risk that happening again?  I don't tell my friends who work in my field when I apply for a job unless they live somewhere else and would definitely not apply.  I'm not risking adding even more people to the pool when I don't have to.  She can feel however she wants about this, but I think the only reason she's upset is she missed out on a free job search.

""I didn't tell you about this job because the last time I told you about a job I really wanted, you applied for it too, and you ended up getting it.  I don't want that happening again, and since we're in the same industry, I think it's damaging to our friendship to be competitive like this.""  Something like that is good because it's not inflammatory or emotional, it's the facts.  You can tell her that it hurt your feelings or something, but if she has half a brain she should know that."
Good man.  Never cry over garbage.  
"Depends on the time of year but most people don't skin out coyotes at all because the vast majority of them have really nasty coats.  You have to catch them with their winter coat (summer coat is basically useless) and then treat the hell out of the fur to make sure all the critters are dead and washed out.  It ends up being more work than the average hunter is willing to put in.  Never heard of anybody eating one, either.  If there's a bounty on them where you live, the standard procedure is to cut off the tail for proof of the kill and leave the rest of the body for the vultures.

Even if you want to go through the trouble, I don't see why you'd do it in your front yard, especially when you're expecting company.  Unless the front yard has the only tree on your property you can use to string up a carcass, in which case you really should have invested the tiny sum of money needed for a rack.  Coyote hunters that actually skin a lot usually have a rack that attaches straight to their trailer hitch so they can do it quickly in the field without hauling an entire dead animal  around.

Either way, there aren't many reasons to do it like that that aren't *really* flimsy."
"OMG she's a *baby* not a toy. Teach him work, not 'ignore things unless it's a game'. "
"&gt;  I wouldn't be surprised if they moved their whole will to the sister to even things out. 

You say that like it's a terrible, unfair thing.  In a case where both kids are in the same situation but the parents decide they like one better than the other, sure, that's terrible.  But when one kid has already inherited a huge amount of money from another source, I don't see why leaving more, or all (depending on the size of the estate) to the child who didn't inherit anything is a bad thing.

Speaking personally, I know that my brother will be getting a larger share of our parent's estate than I will because he has a learning disability and has a harder time providing for himself, and I have no problem with that.  Clearly OP will have an easier time providing for himself than his sister will, so why not leave her more?"
"Obviously you shouldn't go back to working just because she wants you to. That'd be strange and would just lead to more resentment. It's your life and your choice. 

That said, you have a couple of choices. A) Do nothing, let things continue, she'll get nastier and things will get worse and you guys will break up in a bad way. B) Break up with her now. C) Find your passion. 

It sounds like right now you're just drifting. You have copious amounts of free time and the luxury to do nothing at all. I absolutely envy you this myself, and yet... You're not actually so well off that you can travel and truly enjoy your life. You have enough to keep yourself in a comfortable cocoon, but where's the adventure? Where's the learning new things and expanding your mind and real freedom? You're stuck in the nice nest you made. You seem content to stay there, but it's not a splendid life. If your life was a movie this would be a middle filler followed by ""several years later"", it wouldn't be the happy ending. 

At first I thought she was just jealous and resentful, but now thinking about it I think she might be *bored* and resentful. You're doing nothing. You're contributing nothing. She can be proud of the fact that you're a self-made man who became financially independent at 19, but you can only rest on your laurels for so long. Is this going to be her life with you, reading and playing games and working out? Where's the drive to do better yet? "
"&gt; I like outdoor survival, hitchhiking, camping, hunting, video games, comics. I swear a lot, have a pretty deep voice, can be somewhat aggressive. 

Sounds sexy as hell to me. Then again, I'm a lesbian, so might not be what you want to hear haha. But I'm pretty sure there is a guy who will appreciate you for who you are. I know a girl with interests like these and she is happily married to a man. You should keep doing what makes you happy and don't change for the sake of finding a boyfriend. I'd not focus that much on dating and just let it flow naturally, you have plenty of hobbies, eventually you will meet someone who wants you to stay the way you are. "
"I think you should focus less on how much time your wife is spending with each kid and more with how much time you are. Every argument you have is that your action and behavior is based on your wife's. This isn't a competition or some sort of ""I have to make things even"" task. You spoils only be focusing on the fact that you spend your time with the kids unevenly. It's kind of messed up especially because now is the time to teach your son how to bond with his sister before she becomes a 2 year old monster. If your wife isn't spending enough time with your son that's a problem she needs to fix,  not you. This isn't about your son at all, this is about you projecting your shit onto your kids and this will leak out when they are older and cause a great deal of damage if you and your wife don't start getting over yourselves and parenting both kids equally together."

He's going out with a bang. He likes you a lot and wants to do something really nice for you before you both go your separate ways. He seems like a good guy. 
"Nope, nope, nope.

None of that is acceptable.  He might as well just fuck a fleshlight.  I don't think you should do this any more (nor should you have ever done it in the first place, IMO).  All you are doing is enabling his porn addiction.  He needs to detox off of porn for a while so he can get back to the real world.  "

One does not simply 'call up JLaw'
"With three others I'm sure it wasn't the first, either. "
"You didn't answer my questions... Did SHE actually say those things, or did you just assume?"
"Right?! I have zero jealousy issues, I'm in a poly relationship for christssake, but if my boyfriend was muttering creepy shit under his breath about othet people I would tell him to cut it out. Not ok. "
"I can understand being upset about being lied to, but I think what you're feeling is probably a lot of embarrassment about how your parents and friends acted. 

Sometimes people who are bi-racial are used to not being accepted by one or both sides of their cultures. No matter what he does, to some people Jimmy will never be Korean enough, even though that's part of who he is. You need to understand this, because if you have kids and they look a little like him, they might be treated like Jimmy one day too. 

Don't you wonder how your boyfriend was able to sit through all that abuse and not say anything? And why he would still be with you after all that. If anything, he has a right to be mad and judge you for having these kind of people in your life. But maybe he is a calm enough person to know that when people say bad things about you, it shows you more about their character than yours. Or maybe (sadly), he has seen this kind of negative and judgmental behavior before from other relatives. I suspect that this might be the case. He is used to people judging him because they've judged all his life and he has learned to just brush it off.

Like I said, I do understand feeling upset that he was completely honest with you. You want to be in a relationship with someone who is able to trust you. And three years is a long time. However, I can understand where he's coming from too. 

Talk it over. See if you can use this to come to a deeper understanding of each other. Maybe you can use this to become a stronger person who can stand up to your relatives and friends more. Or be a better example at least. And maybe you can have a better understanding of his heart and character. This may put a distance between you, but you can also choose to let it draw you closer."
"&gt; Clumsy people usually leave a trail of their own broken shit, and take excessive care with other people's shit.

And I bet that if your husband showed you a hamper and asked you to never touch the things in it, you would purposely walk on the other side of the room to avoid accidentally setting it on fire or something. (source, am clumsy, have clumsy-related anxiety) Even if we assume all the electronics are actually accidents, the part about the clothes shows me that she is just a jerk. How do you ""accidentally ruin"" something that you were told to leave alone? It's not like he threw one sweater in the wrong basket and she inadvertently ruined it. He asked her to just leave them be and she willfully decided to wash them and did a terrible job. That's not being clumsy.

"
What did he do at the rehearsal dinner?
"I just want to second this in regards to his age.  He is nearly 30.  This means his body and its ability to bounce back from heavy physical stress and injury is really slowing down.  It also becomes harder for a body to adapt to new stresses and learn new physically demanding tasks that require fine coordination and muscle memory.

Anyone in sport or dance will tell you so.  There are reasons martial artists, athletes and dancers begin training young.  Same goes for any career that requires high physical performance levels.  This is why athletes are very aware of their use-by date.  Those who have developed their skill and expertise may hold on a little longer but after 30?  It's pain, little gain, decline and inevitably a great deal of disablement in 10-20 years.  

They have to plan accordingly.  Getting into think kind of thing *now*?  With no skill/expertise to back it up?  Crazy.

I suspect your fiance is having trouble with realizing his life no longer has a lot of wriggle room in regards to his future.  This isn't quite so (I say this as someone going back after years for a law degree) but he has some huge life-changing commitments that effectively limit his options.  He may be panicking.

Talk to him and explain how worried and concerned you are.  Get counseling if you can.  He might have many dreams but everyone has to choose just one.  He did, even if the grass looks greener for the moment.  Use the advice given to remind him that's an illusion."
"&gt;  I feel like that day and **him holding onto his past** was the beginning of the end of our relationship.

The fact that you're blaming him for ""holding onto his past"" really illustrates how much you do not understand what it's like to be an abuse victim. Of course he's ""holding onto his past,"" his parents destroyed his childhood and left him with wounds that may NEVER fully heal. If someone came up to you and brutally attacked you, how would you feel when you saw that person again? Would you welcome them with open arms, or would you stay well clear of them?

The fact that it was his parents who brutalized him validates his decision to have no contact MORE. These were the two people who were responsible for caring for him, keeping him safe, and making sure he grew up in a loving home. They did the exact opposite. It's the ultimate betrayal of trust.

He's not ""holding onto his past,"" he's trying to survive and heal from all of the grievous damage his parents have done to him."
"&gt; I told her that if we are going to have better sex then we should communicate about it, but the way she is addressing it currently is demoralizing and not making me want to have sex with her anymore.
 
I think you worded that perfectly. And I think you should continue to not have sex with her until she starts acting more mature and communicates her needs and desires more productively. But what was her response when you told her that?
 
You are doing great in recognising that communication is key when it comes to sex. Maybe she's not as comfortable talking about these things as you are. I would ask her why if she felt the sex was 'average' she never said anything until you asked. "
"And posts telling OP to delete the gym, facebook up and hit the lawyer."
He threatened you with an ultimatum. If you bring up a marriage timeline again he will break up with you. He accused you of presenting an ultimatum when it is really him putting that on the table. He will get his way - you won't bring it up again because he believes you won't leave. He would *rather break up with you then have a conversation about your future together!* That should tell you everything you need to know.
"If he were a stellar guy, he'd have spoken up about this YEARS ago and refused to eat before the women. My Indian brother would have. My Indian husband would have. 

Make no mistake, this isn't being typically Indian. This is being a raging sexist. This not normal - I'm Indian, and NO ONE I know does this. "
Nothing is more important than your attraction to her and haircuts are permanent.  Got it.
"Completely agree. This is a medical procedure that you do not feel is optional for Kate. You can explain that you'd do the same for Pippa, or bail her out if she lost her job and needed some cash, something necessary not superfluous. And, no, it doesn't have to be exactly $12k. 

My mom bailed out my brother when he needed $3k for an emergency operation for his cat. She didn't offer me any money because she didn't have to. My brother needed that money then and I didn't. I have no resentment. 

Perhaps that is where you and your husband disagree? Does he feel this surgery is ""cosmetic,"" like medicare does?"
"Maybe the cousin who's complaining is being obnoxious about it, but she's still got a point.  If this was an actual charity, and they used money earmarked for one purpose for something else instead without consulting the donors first, that *would* be a big deal.  Like, potential legal action big deal.  If I were them, I'd give her money back and be glad she's the only one objecting."
"""I'm sorry"" is supposed to mean you realize you've done something wrong and want to express remorse.  In this case, I think ""I'm sorry"" means ""I don't really give a shit about your garden, which is why I let it happen in the first place, but if I say 'sorry' will you shut up about it so I can go back to having fun?""

I don't want to be so harsh, but he either knew it was wrong and didn't care, or he didn't think it was a big deal.  Knowing how hard you worked on it, if he didn't think it was a big deal what does that say about him?  And if he just didn't care, what does *that* say about him?

He didn't just trample over a few geraniums or take out a row of beans.  He *destroyed* something that he *knew* was important to you.  Something you put your heart, soul, and sweat into.  That is just all kinds of fucked up, and you need to seriously consider if this is the man you really want to share your life with."
"It's likely he'll wait until he thinks things are ""fixed"" with you, then he'll sneak back to her.  Don't give him the chance to try and fix things."
"For what it's worth, my dad is also fairly introverted. 

Having a sibling meant my sister and I could play together, especially when we were old enough to not need constant adult supervision. Dad would be upstairs reading, mom on the phone, sister and I playing barbies in the basement. "

"I don't know why you're trying to justify him going through it by blaming him not making it clear he spoke the language.

The reason people don't like what you're saying isn't because he deceived you and they think it's ok, it's because you think part of the responsibility for stopping his poor treatment lies on him. You're basically saying he 'spied' because the only proper way for your family not to insult him to his face was to make it clear that he understood what they were saying. 

The whole thing is just disgusting. I get you tried to defend him, but it has happened all along. Did you ever tell him what they were saying about him? Did you ever make it perfectly clear that their treatment was unacceptable? They have even apparently insulted his family to their faces as well? His family have obviously raised an good man, at least."
"Yeah, mine blocked every attempt for me to go to college, actively sabotaged my funding etc, I dropped out and returned 10 years later, but I am My Son The Professor, Look What I Achieved as a Mother.

What drove him was that he was a shitty person who only cares about himself. Stop trying to take responsibility or justify his actions."

"Do it. Honestly, you're offering them free use of a lake house for a month, and they're responding like entitled children.

Oh boo fucking hoo. You open a dialogue with your partner about feeling resentment. You don't fucking secretly ejaculate in their facial lotion. 
"So Megan didn't want to go and take care of you and YOUR dog but people made her go anyways.

Then she, obviously not being a dog person, didn't understand that the dog was in distress and tried to hurry along the thing that she didn't want to do (because it's not her dog). 

She also asked for some water out of the bottle you bought.


So, according to the other replies, she is literally the devil and fuck her with a chainsaw.

I mean, it's your dog so why is any of this Megan's fault at all? I'm not trying to be rude I just don't really understand what she did wrong.

Edit: I mean it's obvious she has some empathy issues. But not everyone is going to be in love and in tune with YOUR dog. You were the one who made the decision to bring your dog out on a hot day."
I didn't accept the money. I just asked them to use some of it to come visit me after I move back to my home state.
I wouldn't be able to stomach reading the last thread again. So much blind defense of OP. 
"There's someone out there who will be excited to discuss your future. Someone who will get butterflies at the thought of saying vows with you. You deserve that person; not this guy who's comfortable with stasis even though you've made it clear you're unhappy. You're doing the right thing.

Don't waste any more time on him, when you could be spending time finding someone who's right for you. Good luck!"
"Yeah, I couldn't resist telling their parents, no matter what happens with the STD test."
"Just set up recurring appointments-- massage once a week, mani-pedi every two weeks. If you're STILL having trouble (and don't just want to live it up for the next few years), bring a different friend or family member once a month.

"Tramadol is a narcotic, or so I've been told by my doctor. Be wary of it because I have seen people be addicted to it and it is just as severe as opioid addiction. "
Yeah it has made me really angry more than once over the years too. This kind of issue has been the biggest source of conflict throughout our marriage and I didn't see it coming when we were dating.
"Oftentimes when people have abusive childhoods, they end up in abusive relationships as adults. The best explanation I've read for this is that it's like a car alarm. When you're in danger all the time as a child, your warning alarms go off so often that you become desensitized to it, like most of us are with car alarms now. It means that as you go into relationships as an adult, you don't have a reliable warning system to tell you that this person isn't safe. 

Because a man who tries to coerce you into reliving childhood rape multiple times a week is not a safe person. I think that if you started describing your relationship to us here, we would see an army of red flags. 

Please seek out more therapy. You might also check out the book ""The Body Keeps the Score,"" by Bessel Van der Kolk. It's about the effects of and treatment for childhood trauma. (It's where I read about the ""danger alarm"" issue. Please take care of yourself. "
"First off, your brother is way out of line.

I would bet your brother thinks you've ""betrayed"" your family and is trying to remind you of who you ""were"" or something like that. Not that that makes his behavior okay, but if he's struggling with what he might perceive as a complete change of identity, that's at least something to approach him with. (It is also entirely possible that he's a jerk plain and simple, that he's jealous of your life and your control over it in general, or that he's got other reasons, but again, whatever his reasons, his behavior is not okay.)

In the meantime, I think you're doing the right thing. He refuses to be respectful or see reason, and you should not have to put up with that, especially not in your own home!

Don't budge from the eviction, but if you want to see if you can salvage something, I would tell him you're open to talking about why he thinks his behavior is okay so that (again, only if you wish) you can try and make some headway on getting him to call you by the right name.

I've been struggling with a similar issue where, after having changed my last name as part of my marriage (something I wanted to do) one of my siblings made comments to the effect of me no longer being part of the family, despite the fact that I haven't changed how often I visit or my general participation in my family's lives. We've made a bit of progress on that front, but it is slow and painful. I hope that, if you try to figure things out with him, it goes well."

"That's really alarming, because she's basically saying ""If you say no to sex, there will be consequences."" Flip the genders and imagine your sister or female friend telling you this is what her relationship is like. What do you advise her to do?

Ignoring the fact that this is likely emotional abuse, you guys are straight up not compatible. I don't know who would be compatible with a tyrannical dictator for a partner, but it's not you."
Why not jump ship and just let him fail spectacularly?
"Found it very telling that he didn't consider his responsibility to the kid for a single moment.  
   
If he wants her to be self sufficient he could start by taking the kid.  Or admitting that it's really not that easy to find a job as a single parent with a huge gap on their resume.  
   
If I were her I wouldn't be jumping at the opportunity to left on my own with a kid and no money either... basic survival instinct here...."
"This comment is so telling. You already suspect he'll resent you for setting boundaries and asking him to right a wrong he is responsible for. You are only revealing more reason why you shouldn't marry him, and why you need to start looking into how to stand up for yourself. A halfway decent person would have volunteered to do all of that stuff the moment he woke up today, saw all of the damage, even before he saw you crying about it. You suspect he'll get pissed at you for asking him to do something a decent person would have decided to do on his own. You have bigger problems than a destroyed garden. "
"I completely agree that there should be more treatment available for pedophiles, but equating it to homosexuality is so wrong. Homosexuality is between consenting adults, pedophilia is an act perpetrated upon the innocent and vulnerable. Homosexuality is an orientation, pedophilia is a mental illness. "
"The Title IX officer totally dropped the ball. This is a pretty serious situation, and your prof was effectively stalking you. It astounds me how you were treated in this matter. One suggestion I have is to go to the Dean of Students and make a formal complaint against him and the department for not protecting you. You've already tried with the Department; it's time to keep going further and further up the chain even if it takes going to the President of the university.

"My ex boyfriend used to do things like this too. My highlights were ""unnatural"", and he prefers natural beauty, so I had brown hair for 2 years. He didn't like makeup, so I thought makeup was for girls whose boyfriends didn't think they were pretty.

It is now 6 years since we broke up, and I only realized last year that our relationship was emotionally abusive."
"You leave.Have you ever heard ""out of the frying pan and in to the fire""? He helped you out of one abusive relationship and in to another.Alcoholics and drug addicts are not good partners."
"I've had that conversation with her I was as firm and brutally honest as I could have been about it. I didn't let the Vegas trip slide despite her trying to push it away and make it disappear.

Her words were that she would try her best to change but she didn't know if she could or if this was just how she had always been.

She saw the wrong she did and even her best friend told her that her behavior was unacceptable but still she just seemed indifferent about whether she could change or not.

I know trust issues are tough to overcome but she seems to lack all type of motivation and when I told her that basically I needed change or I was going to have to rethink our relationship, she sat there with a blank stare on her face.

Almost as if telling me, to leave. I don't know if it was a guilt trip to make me feel sorry for her, if she doesn't think I'll actually leave or her pride refusing to accept that she has to change or she will lose everyone close to her.

&gt;Walking out immediately after two years together and this being the first time something like this has happened seems premature if the relationship is otherwise solid.

Not to dismiss our relationship but to me, spending hours in a dorm one another and time around campus is one thing but actually interacting outside of it is huge to me.

I feel like in the two years we've been dating that she's always had excuses to try to keep us like that. I'm an active person I play sports for my college and outside of that she never wanted to do anything.

Even going on the trip she was so apprehensive about it that we nearly didn't even go with them. She used every excuse she could think of for us to spend another summer to lazing around instead of doing stuff.

I think maybe I've been too clueless or naïve to pick up on the subtle warning signs that maybe my relationship has always been like this."

"1. DNA test your son. I don't care if he looks like you. The guy who is his daddy could also look like you. 

2. Talk to a lawyer and get an informed opinion from her/him about what your divorce obligations would look like. Ask about things like custody, child support, alimony and property division. I think you have a very skewed view of what those things will look like, and it's unlikely they will be as bad as you think. And, at the end of the day, it's a price worth paying to get this toxic woman out of your life. "
Perhaps but my point is that this specific advice is common from counselors and therapists.
"It's not unfair to your daughter to not allow her to be used at a pawn in her grandparent's game of manipulation. Give back the car. She'll be pissed, but she's 16; she'll get over it, especially once she realizes how toxic your husband's parents are. "
"Honey. You said it yourself. She has a way of figuring things out. While I understand your desire to cut her out, I am telling you now, this method that you are proposing is very likely to fail.

"In my experience, people who claim their ex is ""trying to poison our child against me"" are usually the one trying to do just that... (Luckily most kids are pretty smart and don't fall for it, unluckily those kids have at least one crappy parent.)

(Edit: oh, also sometimes it's simply that the kid has cottoned on to the fact that the parent making those claims is kind of a selfish jerk with no input from the other parent, but the parent saying their kid is being poisoned against them really really hates their ex and doesn't entirely get that their kid is an entire human being who can form their own opinions.)"
"&gt; He said he's worried I'll never let him develop close relationships with females again.

As he should be because he fucking cashed in that trust card when he *cheated on you*.  You're not crazy.  You have a legitimate reason to be concerned.  If your husband isn't empathetic, you either need to have a very honest discourse with him or consider couples therapy to talk through the very legitimate trust issues (and maybe he needs a 3rd party's perspective as to why you feel this way)."

I could have really used the support! And then he and his family book a trip, and without even ASKING ME, tells his family I don't want to go. Sure, ive never been great friends with his mom, but it stillnwould have been nice to be asked. Why is he doing this? I'm trying to better my situation, but all I get is distance and no respect. 

Can you see how shitty you've probably made her feel the past few months of the relationship? Is it any wonder she broke up with you?"
"This post is really nice but doesn't seem all that realistic. And does a disservice to OP. 

The **OP** is the one who thinks that it's because of her activities/hobbies/lack of girliness that she's not finding a man. But we aren't obligated to agree with her perception. 

How about her aggressiveness? She says she gets dates. So obviously her deep voice, posture or how she dresses isn't keeping men away. It also seems highly doubtful that camping or hiking is driving men away. 

But she describes being aggressive. In fact jumps immediately to being defensive and claiming she's not abusive. Hmmmm... Ok?

I have met women like her before. They think that just because they were on the rugby team and take shit from no one, that's why guys don't like them. Men are intimidated.

*They're wrong*. It's because these women are so loud and aggressive that people get sick and tired of feeling like every damn conversation is an argument. Talking to these women become quickly exhausting as you have to voice your opinion equally as aggressively or expect it to be trampled all over. Having your voice heard with these types of people constantly feels like a battle. And who the hell wants to deal with all of that when you thought you were just grabbing a beer and chilling? 

We can all be rainbows and flowers, and say that OP should be true to herself. But realistically if she's as aggressive as she says, the only men she will attract will be aggressive assholes. Giving the advice to chill out a bit more is not telling her to change who she is. And it'll likely improve her chances of happiness. "

Edit 1: He told the Dean before we went on our first date. The Dean verified that the decline and rise of my grades were consistent in all classes (school was less of a priority when I found out about my dad's diagnosis). Now that I am officially graduated and no longer affiliated with the university academically, it's not an issue. He did warn him that students will gossip but assured that there is nothing wrong and Mark's choice in being proactive rather than reactive was in very good judgment."

"Speaking as someone who's into BDSM, if you don't think someone having a scared reaction to something you know is extreme is reasonable, then you're not being reasonable.

I KNOW that some of the things I'm into, without proper negotiation and consent, ARE violent, abusive and hurtful. The only thing that makes them not so are the negotiations I have with my partners. And for a second I don't blame anyone who is freaked out by some of the stuff I'm interested in, especially if they have no experience with it and don't understand the importance of boundaries and consent. Shit, they SHOULD be freaked out because it could easily be abuse.

The problem with a lot of mainstream porn (even without BDSM, check out the story of the woman who starred in Deep Throat) is that you have zero idea if there is negotiation and consent happening unless you either witness it beforehand through an interview or buy from a company you know is ethical. The fantasy and the reality when it comes to porn are often so muddled you can easily be watching a pornographic film and not know that the people involved are being raped. 

And sorry, a gif of a woman having her throat slit during a blow job - you really think that's something a sane individual can see and think, ""Oh your kink is not my kink!""

Listen to u/nephrine OP. I have a friend... or ex-friend... who is an all around successful guy. Pretty hot, well-spoken, successful, making nice money for our age. Well guy's also got some serious commitment and women/mommy issues and after high school he's always dated teenagers. 

He's 24 now and dating a 19 year old kid. They started when they were like 22 and 17. She adores him, thinks he's the best thing after sliced bread. 

Truth is women our age just sniff out the bullshit. Some teen girls just aren't able to (yet)."

Not only would it improve your life currently, it would be a good idea to have a preexisting relationship of trust with a doctor/therapist in the event that you start showing signs of schizophrenia in the future. They can also notice any problems early and hopefully get you medicated before you start acting out. "

"She didn't accept it from the sister of her bf, she accepted from the girl who knowingly fucked her cheating bf (at the time). Context matters. 

Yes later she became the sister of her bf, but she obviously didn't turn into a better human being. She still sucks and is being an unreasonable douchebag, having brought this entire situation on herself, start to finish. Also I think op is better off choosing the certs over being a part of that asshole family. "

This is like psychopathic behavior. Like scary crazy
"Most people have a type, and most end up with somebody who seems to be *not* of their type. They don't go around threatening to break up and crushing self-esteems. 

There is much more to you than your body and your weight. But it seems that putting on a few pounds would be enough to overshadow everything else about you. 

Now I would not be awfully excited about my SO becoming *overweight*, but there are gentler ways to encourage exercise, to motivate a person, and to explain that physical attraction (which is fundamentally important) could suffer. That's not to say ""another pound, and you are single""."

"Aside from the physical damage, this is doing emotional damage to your poor baby.  A baby that age needs a responsive caregiver who will interact with her.  That's how babies develop empathy, develop relationships with their parents, and learn how to have relationships with other people.  Your child is at risk for lifelong emotional damage from the kind of distracted non-parenting she's getting right now.  Therapy won't fix it later, either.

I think you need to move out, get a college kid to babysit while you're working (if you earn more per hour than you pay the babysitter, it works out), max out all your credit cards, and save your children's emotional and physical health.  This is serious and if you don't intervene now, you won't be able to fix it later.  

One of my cousins had nonresponsive parents like this, btw.  He grew up to be the kind of kid who tortured animals for fun.  Think about it."
I get the impression that OP's family are not exactly good with $
"You did the right thing.

A vase isn't a big deal, even if it does cost a lot.  It's just a thing.

You just saved your sister from a scumbag who could have given her an STD or worse.  "
"&gt; I think she meant that it would be nice for your son to have both a dad and a mom again. 

The kid has both a mom and a dad already :x Just because they're divorced doesn't change that the child already has a family. It's really presumptuous and not well thought out for her to have said that. It may have come from a ""good place"" but it was still not a great thing to say, all things considered. "
"Also, stop ranting about your ex to his friends (it's not a mutual friend if you hadn't seen him since your breakup). That's really petty, it gives the impression that you lost weight to get back at him and are still not over him, and it is also what started this shit in the first place. You're equally participating in the middle school drama by badmouthing your ex as soon as you meet people who know him."
"OP, you know why he feels like he can't trust you?

Because he can't.

He confided in you on the condition that you didn't tell his mother. What did you do?

Tell his mother.

You don't deserve him."
How did he not learn it in forty-eight years? This is a middle aged man.
"That's what pisses me off. I'm not saying he doesn't hit the gym hard, I just feel like he wouldn't be able to if he hadn't had that lap band surgery to get him off to a MUCH easier start, weight-loss wise.

LITERALLY the only way to get this guy to stop eating was to CUT OFF PART OF HIS STOMACH. I'm not trying to criticize anyone else who has had lap-band surgery, I'm just saying the brutally honest truth - he couldn't be arsed to ""eat healthy meals/portions"" until he got surgery. He has NO room to criticize anyone else who has not begun to lose weight yet, esp. if they haven't had surgery. It's a luxury and many people don't qualify because of physical or financial reasons.

What a jerk."
"""Whenever I tell him that he just says, ""baby I'm right here,"" ""

And then you say ""What I mean is, I want some quality time with just the two of us interacting and giving all our attention to each other.  I love that you love our daughter so much, but I don't think you realize how much less attention and energy I get now.  I don't want to take away your time bonding with her, I am just asking for some time bonding with me too.  Can we schedule one or two weekends a month where your mother watches her and we do something to reconnect?  I think it's important that we keep ""dating"".  What do you think?"""
"Not to mention asking her to style her hair the way she had when she was really young, and wanting it to cover over her breasts.

**ALARM ALARM ALARM**"
"If you try to win this battle by banning your mom from using your photo, it's not going to end well for either of you.

I suggest using a subtler and gentle technique to persuade her to change the photo. Take her out to lunch one day and suggest taking a few selfies with her. Then the next day, tell her to change her profile photo to the new selfie and pout if she is reluctant. ""But mom, it's such a cute photo and I want everyone to see how cute we are together."" She wants to keep that photo because she loves you and is proud of you, so work that angle."
"&gt; I try to be romantic in other ways - make her coffee, bring her home drinks she likes, offer to rub her shoulders or whatever, but it's like sex is the only thing that counts!

As a high-libido partner, my low-libido husband is like this, and I've got to tell you, for a lot of years there, those coffees and moments of consideration were always tainted by baggage of ""I don't love you the way you need to be loved, but here, have this nice thing I got you."" It's like a consolation prize. It doesn't feel good. It feels like a pity coffee or a pity massage. 

I stayed in my relationship for reasons that aren't relevant here, and I learned to find other ways of thinking about this, but I would never in a million years recommend anyone do so if they didn't have compelling reasons for it. By that, I mean much bigger reasons than just ""I love him/her"" - that doesn't automatically mean you stay together. Compatibility counts for a hell of a lot, and in a really important way, you two apparently aren't. 

If your girlfriend was the one asking, I'd be telling her to bail. But since you're here asking, I can only tell you, all those moments that I know you genuinely mean with love and warmth are twisting the knife for her. You don't love her the way *she* needs to be loved, with passion and longing, and there's no sugarcoating the fact. You can't make that fact not hurt. It hurts. It just does."
"I was coming to say this. If it really is a dealbreaker for him, then fine. However, he should spend some time examining the reasons why. "
I'm so happy my husband proposed in private but I cry at public proposals. I think you're overthinking it a bit and your original idea was/is great. Don't do what those other people did.
You didn't think letting your girlfriend know a woman would be clinging to you for several hours was important? Do you still think she's overreacting by wanting you to limit your relationship with this girl?
"&gt;How can this guy who I love and thought I knew who was thoughtful and caring be with this many women and have even an ounce of respect for any of us.

How can you judge the amount of respect he has for anyone by the number of partners he's had? Do you think people can't have short-term sexual relationships while respecting one another? Stop projecting onto him. 

&gt; let me state that Bill is a wonderful husband. He is supportive and compassionate and we have no real issues between us.

You're a lucky person. You can decide to make an issue out of this and ruin your happy relationship, or you can focus on the good relationship you have.

Your call, but I know what I'd recommend..."
"It doesn't even have to be skin problems. My hair doesn't look good if I shower every day and if I wear a shower cap the humidity of the shower still fucks it up. I shower every 2-3 days. I don't think it's ""over"" without a conversation about it but I do think this is her problem. "
"Absolutely do not forgive them, this was your lowest moment and they decided to show you how little regard for you as a person they have, head over to r/raisedbynarcissists but yea never forget this never forgive"
"&gt;  Some guys are threatened by confident and intelligent women, but would you really want to date those guys? 

Exactly. So much this. 

One time, only one time, a man was upset that I asked him out. He got angry in fact! And that told me that he was not someone I should date- I'm a confident and assertive woman, and obvs he couldn't handle that. "
"&gt;**tl;dr:** Everyone I know can eat a bag of dicks. I like my bf

That's all you need to say"
"I think they're in quite different situations. For their own wedding, Andy called ahead of time, apologizing for not inviting, explained why and even asked them to a dinner in a kind of private celebration. His hurt is understandable. Steve and Rachel just seem self absorbed. "
"&gt;He would joke with her and she would say, ""Kiss my ass"", to which his response would be, ""I'm actually into that"".

I say this to my own brother. My brother said ""Fuck you"" to me, which I replied ""Don't threaten me with a good time"" and we laughed. It isn't a serious response. I don't want to fuck my brother because of a response during banter.

Chill. Out."
"It's really not his fault his family is racist.

Say the roles were reversed, how would you feel if he dumped you if your family was racist towards him?"
"It sounds like OP attached himself to the mother before they were close enough for him to reveal the abuse, and then he probably couldn't trust her to not tell mom what he was saying about her or try to patch things up between them. 

I agree BF made mistakes throughout the relationship, but OP is not somebody he could trust with this. "
"Yep, I've posted about it previously. We actually resolved a lot of the issues I posted about and things were alright for a while. Now a whole new set of issues cropped up and now I feel like it's just going to be neverending problems because you know what? they all have the same cause: he is selfish and doesn't give a crap about me. 

I can keep having discussions with him about different problems until I'm blue in the face and we can resolve them all as the crop up. But new issues will always happen because he's not a good person. 

I think I'm done here. "
"Your boyfriend thinks he has all the time in the world to make up his mind.  Disabuse him of that notion.  Get your affairs in order and find a short stay apartment or see if a friend/relative has a room or couch spare.  Pack your bags, and take the boyfriend aside.

""Boyfriend, I am not waiting around forever.   It's been six years and you are still undecided about me.  I am going to make this decision far easier for you.  I am temporarily moving out.

I am not going to pressure you or force you into doing something you don't want to.  However, your reluctance makes me unhappy.  Your attitude toward marriage and kids makes me feel like I am bullying you.  

If you cannot commit to an engagement by [date], a wedding between [reasonable dates], and beginning to try for kids by [x] years time, I will be making this separation permanent.  You have until the end of October (or pick another month) to decide.""

Then move out.  If he tries to stop you, tell him you cannot come back until his priorities are in order and you know where you stand.  Call his friends and ask them to check up on him.

This will go one of two ways - either he'll come around and be begging for you back, or he'll realise being single is great.  Either is fine because it means you'll get what you want.  Good luck!"
"It was unintentional until now. The wedding hasn't happened, they know the bride is uncomfortable with the dress, and they are refusing to cooperate. That's rude. "
I'd change my locks just for peace of mind.  Be very thankful you didn't marry this man
"Thank you for addressing this point specifically.

OP, this commenter is right. Manners, decency and respect are excellent things to observe in a relationship and a breakup. But you must forget about them when dealing with an abuser like your BF. 

The only thing that matters is your safety. The only thing that matters is getting you away from him for good."
"Damn that edit though. That was way over the line and he should not have said that. You didn't cause him to be an ass, he did that on his own."
"haha it's okay, I understand. my bullshit meter went off for sure. In fact I've never seen any concrete evidence that he was married. But I was infatuated and I guess I wanted to believe it.
 Like said though, one side of his story wife's dead and he's distraught cause he can't see kid, then he gives me the story that it isn't his kid and wife is alive. And I don't think either are true.

The thing is, I think he was trying to feed me whatever I wanted to hear because I probably wouldn't date him if he had a kid with him....but I honestly don't think the kid ever existed, and he was just trying to be consistent with his previous story (that he told me).

I know that sounds ridiculous but from the webs of nonsense and lies it's the only thing that now makes sense to me."
"There are a lot of similar arrangements quietly done.

1. Talk to husband
1. If the husband talk goes well, talk to brother and SiL
1. If your sister and BiL go for the idea, talk to a lawyer.

Whatever you do, do it fast."
Worst part is that it isn't the first time according to the OP's post.
"She is not shy at all, and she is popular. She is not bullied. She considers herself mature, for her age, and I'm very sure that is adding to this whole mess."
"That's kind of an unfair statement.

Speaking from experience having been cheated on and learning my family broke up due to cheating, there is a lot more anger at the new partner when they were actively involved in the destruction of the relationship. It's like they are sticking around and rubbing it in everyone's face, ""I won! Look! I'm still here! The constant reminder!""

OP might not have liked the idea of his father being with anyone else besides his mom, but to say his anger would be on the same level isn't right. 

You don't get to do shitty things and then demand the respect of a decent human being. It sounds like OP's father and his new wife just want to sweep the ""unpleasantness"" under the rug and pretend everything is hunky-dory. But to OP, it isn't, and he shouldn't be guilted into pretending to do so."
"Seconding contacting the adoption agency. 

1. they'll have trained mediators

2. someone needs to tear them a new ass for giving details of a closed adoption"
"Thank you! I worry sometimes that I come off as insensitive. I'm just used to a lot of neurotypical people being like, ""LOL I'm so OCD!"" and I just felt the need to differentiate between the occasional quirk, and something that could really wreck OP's life if she's not careful.

Everybody's partner has littler quirks and a few strange preferences, but this is not something to be ignored. Thanks again for making me feel good about my practice! :)"
"&gt; But it doesn't make Carol a monster.

It makes her a shitty friend, which is relevant to OP's point. If OP is accurate in her timeline, that OP told Carol about the job, asked for assistance in applying, then found out Carol was applying herself who then got it then laughed it off. I'd be salty as fuck too. 

Carol seems like a marginally decent colleague, but a shitty friend."
"I think my parents are just happy to see one of their kids in an interracial relationship. They're awesome, young-at-heart 70's hippies and they've always been super progressive about everything. But I'm honestly just tired"
"My guy would have said ""you're doing porn and not letting me watch? how rude!!"". Then when I stumbled over my words to explain or whatever, he would have teased me without mercy."
"Because the reason he couldn't tell her right now is that she can't keep her mouth shut! She could have chosen to wait two weeks or said ""tell me now, it's a dealbreaker"", but she should have kept this within the relationship. 

I would dump OP in a hot second if I was the fiance. "
"&gt; Explain to her that accusing you of being a cheater makes you feel like shit. You won't ever cheat, **but if she's trying to get you to leave, this is a good way to do that.** Make this clear: You aren't the sort to ever cheat, but you will leave one day if she doesn't treat you with the respect you deserve. Calling you a cheater every day isn't respectful.

This right here. It is very disrespectful to continue punishing someone for something they haven't even done. But there is always a motive behind it.  Either they are morbidly insecure because of their past, are cheating themselves and projecting on to you, or they are cowards and don't know how to end a relationship so they play these games....e.g. drive you away. "
You dont find that odd in the slightest? 3 years in?
"Im around the same age as him and I eat constantly. Copious amounts of food.  I workout regularly so I have a lot of muscle mass and that burns a lot of calories.  So im eating like 3-4k of calories per day and yes it is expensive.

I used to clean my girlfriends kitchen cupboards out like a swarm of loscusts clear a wheat field, and it isnt very respectful of her needs/wants. So I start bringing my own stuff over.

So break the problem down. What are the non-neogotiables?  He needs to eat so there is nothing you can do about that, so what is left is WHAT is he going to eat and WHO is going to pay for it.

You love to cook, and you make enough expecting you will have some for days.  This is reasonable.  So get a special container, and what is yours, put it in that so you can expect that if will be there when you go to eat later.

That doesnt mean he can eat, but what he eats is up to him to go buy AND up to him to make.  He should be contributing more to the food bill if he is eating most of the food.

Run that by him and see what he says.  He seems reasonable and caring, so it seems he would be okay with that."
"After all the posts I've read on Reddit, I can't even tell you how happy it makes me to read about someone who actually had the strength to stand up for herself and get out of a bad situation.  Even you just having the guts to tell you mom that she never tried to stop you dad hitting you in the past and that's why you're not going to come around to see them and standing up for yourself in that was is impressive.

I feel so proud of you (even though I don't know who you are) and proud that you're making this good decision to break away from a poisonous environment so that you have a better life for yourself in the future!  It's such a beacon of hope for other women and men in bad situations!"
"Forgot to mention to the OP that there is a grieving process to go through when losing a mother (even if she isn't dead).

I highly suggest visiting us at /r/raisedbynarcissists/ for further support."
"If you both decide it's ok then it's ok. From your own post though, you asked him to stop and he didn't. That's not ok. "
"I hate that high road kind of thinking. If someone does something shitty they shouldn't get away with it. Actions have consequences, and the reason most people do horrible things is because they think they can get away with it.

I'm not saying to take the low road and be one of those people who harass their exes and always post passive aggressive bullshit on social media. But why should someone lie or omit the truth to protect a scummy person?

"
Emotional roller coasters all day. But it's really weird when people start dancing cause then it feels like a stampede in my belly. 
"Oh, thank you!  I absolutely detest those.  

Giving a child up for adoption is something that is touted again and again and all over the place as an alternative to abortion.  So, we have a system in place to allow women who don't want (or can't get) an abortion to facilitate a better life for their offspring.  They are told that they can have a closed adoption, that their information will be held confidential, and then years later that gets thrown by the wayside by a bunch of people trying to circumvent those wishes.  "
"Your wife is abusive. If this post* had the genders reversed, that would be the first comment. Please get out and get help so you and your daughter can be happy. She will keep abusing you and your daughter when she's old enough..

"Can you perform the job responsibilities expected of you in a professional setting? If so, I wouldn't dwell on this too much. "
"&gt; I can't say I like something without him insinuating my opinions are worthless or I'm dumb. I can't say I don't like something without him criticizing my taste.

Seems like the problem isn't that he's a ""hipster"" but that he's needlessly cruel to you for no reason at all.  

You met when you were 17, it's only natural that people are going to change by the time they're 21.  Maybe the person he's becoming isn't someone you want to be with when you're 25.  But whatever you do, don't confuse him being a sullen jerk with some sort of cultural thing.   "
"&gt;  the dad calls me a selfish cow

&gt; I also got texts from both his parents pleading with me to get the tickets

That whole family thinks it's okay to basically steal your tickets and call you names??? Run away!!

There is absolutely nothing selfish about not letting someone else bully/steal your vacation from you.

&gt; should I contact Jen and explain at all?

No. Josh created the mess, it's his to clean up.

I hope you have a blast on your trip!"
"I'm picturing the ""biggest atheist"" sitting in a church pew, week after week, year after year, compromising *his* beliefs, all because he loved this woman.  

It's twisted, he lied, but somehow still endearing."
I recommended therapy. She said she would look into it but I think the whole thing embarrasses her. She's survived her whole life with her fear. 
"So you're with a man who accuses you and emotionally manipulates you, who refuses to work on himself and is self-centred enough to think he has no issues... 

All while you have a really serious (no offence at all, I just mean it can really seriously alter your way of life at times) mental illness that requires care and understanding...

Why are yall together still?"
