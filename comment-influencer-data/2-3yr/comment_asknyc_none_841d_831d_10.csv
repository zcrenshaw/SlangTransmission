"Weather is fucking nice, go to a goddamn park with some fucking trees and shit"
Understated title of the year award?
Goddamnit. Fine. 
Call your landlord and complain. This is gross.
I hope you find it fucking relaxing and that you have a swell goddamn day
"1. Get on subway
2. Ride it to a stop you don't know
3. Get off subway
4. Walk"
"&gt; I didn't want to be so harsh as to tell the landlord,

It's not ""harsh"" - what these people are doing is public indecency. "
"Where do you live? This is not a normal thing, where ever you live. Complain."
CW Pencil Enterprises in the Lower East Side sells only pencils and is actually pretty cool. They have a good range of prices from 5 cents up to like $5 per pencil.
"Start commuting by bike whenever possible. Follow food bloggers and use Google maps to mark ""want to go"" whenever you identify a good spot. "
I have dressed like a sailor during fleet week and gotten laid. Was never in the military.
"Its either hookerish or she is being exploited somehow. No matter what city you live in, you deserve to not have some guy getting ready for sex or being blown outside your door.  Complain to your landlord. In writing. A lot.  Call and then email and then send a certified letter and what the fuck is wrong with people."
"I think the answer here is to first seek help if you are really depressed. Professional help. 

Also, I was this same way until the start of this year, I made it my new years resolution to get out of the house and it's changed not only my perspective on NYC but just on life in general. My depression stemmed from working a lot from home and not realizing that being that shut in would have an effect on my psyche."
they can't charge you without you agreeing to it. so no you're not going to be charged. you got pretty lucky. I've heard of this happening to others. As someone has programmed different type of machines my guess is that when the guy behind the glass rebooted it the timer of the machine was probably reset 01-01-2000. i see this on vending machines a lot. now that it still works it probably reads it as NULL. like I imagine they have that data as a true boolean since they didn't know how to fix it. so they have if date =2001 then proceed because theyre aware of this error but they probably think most people wont even realize they have a card like that. my 2 cent
Could you get a travel certificate from the DOE? Would provide free entry for the group.  http://www.optnyc.org/schools/cfft.htm
"Do not pull the break in the tunnel. You will be stuck for an hour waiting for police/fire department. 

Edit: if you must, pull the break at a station, not in-between stations."
"There's a Maille mustard store on Broadway btw 21st and 22nd. They probably have some cocktail onions and cornichons too but I believe it's mostly mustard.

Astro West on the UWS near the Museum of Natural History sells mostly mineral formations and fossils.  It's spiritual inheritor of Maxilla and Mandible, which was probably the best store in the whole city as far as I'm concerned."
"Tipping culture is getting way out of hand. I routinely tip 15% at restaurants, 20% if the service is exceptional, but people giving a dollar tip at a coffee shop or food cart are messing shit up.  I used to frequent a bakery in Astoria for coffee.  They use the apple square/iPad thing which always prompts you to tip.  I would actively select ""no tip"" every time as I grab my $3 iced coffee that took 30 seconds to pour. On my like 8th time at this spot the cashier instructs me on how to tip.  I no longer go to this bakery.  I also go to a falafel cart by my job about once a week. Approximately 70% of his customers are tipping $1 for a $5 sandwich, bastards are making me look cheap.  "
Doughnut Plant. The tres leches cake doughnut. 
"Peter Pan and Moe's, just a few blocks away from each other in Greenpoint, are both excellent."
Call the cops?
"I don't know what you've been told, but Penn Station is not some sort of dangerous, labyrinthine hellhole. It's just big, crowded, and ugly. Read the signs if you don't know where to go."
"The injured person is stuck WITH you for as long as it takes to get the train moving and not receiving medical attention in that time. You should *never* pull the emergency break for an injured, sick or violent passenger while you are in the tunnel- you pull it when you get to a platform where emergency services can actually get to you. Pulling the break in the tunnel is only for an emergency that is being caused by the motion of the train itself. "
"/r/NYC isn't very liberal/progressive, even though the city is. Too many people who don't live here post on that board and incite shit."
"I did speak with the father once about not allowing his (grown adult) daughter to hang out in the hallway in the middle of the night, but I was afraid to tell him the exact situation"
And don't forget to fucking smile.
"I used to do this.

Yes, you can watch. 

Rarely they will close it or if crowded limit spectators.

Make sure your phone is off and do not text.

Judges hate it and court officers will call you out on it.

Different courts have different schedules."
"&gt;Staying in Harlem which is not part of the NYC subway system?

Subways exist up in Harlem.

&gt;Staten Island Ferry (goes past statue of liberty donâ€™t get off on other side board onto the right side of the boat)

You will be forced to depart the ferry and then get back on.

&gt;Brooklyn Bridge (Ride the subway into Brooklyn and get off at the first stop under the bridge (High St?) and then walk back into Manhattan on the bridge) (evening)

A/C train will take you to High St, but you can also take the F train to York St.

&gt;Bryant Park (Ice skating 42nd and 6th is FREE admission. Better than central park)

I would not count on ice skating outside in July. You can however go roller skating at Brooklyn Bridge Park.

&gt;Ground Zero

Please don't call it that."
What was his name?
"I work for a property management company where this type of stuff happens more often than one might expect.  Just tell the landlord or your super, they'll write a letter or talk to the tenant.  It's a quality of life issue for the rest of the tenants in the building.  They won't get evicted for it unless it persists.  The landlord can always put up a camera to discourage such activities.  

We had a teenage tenant (son of the leaseholder) who was leaving used condoms around the building from similar activities.  In my experience our supers are very touchy about someone disrespecting their buildings like that (it's their home too after all) and will find a way to stop it."
"Yes!

I'm actually a NYC Prosecutor and when i interned in law school i would sneak out and watch trials.

So, each borough has essentially 2 courts that do criminal trials, ""Criminal Court"" for misdemeanors (think fare evasion or misemeanor duis), and ""Supreme Court: Criminal Term"" for felonies (the law and order dick wolff stuff).  You're more likely to see a ""good"" trial at supreme.

I can't think of a specific day that would be preferable, I just know that August is usually dead.  

What you should do is go to the clerk's desk and ask for a copy of the trial schedule for the day.  Ask the court officers when you get through the metal detector who you should talk to.  

It should list the judge, the defendant, the charge, the room, and sometimes where in the case (ie ""defendant's case"").


You may get some looks when you are in the room as the ADA will think you are a friend of the defendant, the defense will think you are a friend of the victim, and the court officer will think you are a witness and ask you to leave if you are.   Just be quiet, no phones.  You can bring a pen and notebook.

I can't think what else would be helpful but let me know if you have any questions.  "
"I suggest long walks, especially through parts of the city you haven't been to. NYC is a great place for this, because it's almost guaranteed you will see something interesting you would not have guessed was there. Also, exercise and sunshine are good for depression, and navigating the sidewalks can help get your thoughts ""outside of your head"" so the depression doesn't feed itself."
"Probably sunny days  
And where the air is sweet

"
"I've seen studios for that much. They are some combination of:

* Very far (deep in the boroughs)

* Very small (no kitchen, sleeping loft, shared bathroom)

* Very old

* Restricted (only for college students)

Here's your criteria on Streeteasy - 52 results for $1300 studio. http://streeteasy.com/for-rent/nyc/price:-1300%7Cbeds%3C1%7Cbaths%3E=1?view=map#pos=12/40.72397,-73.94623"
"The subway runs all night and does a great job of connecting everything in the city - there aren't many cities that can say the same. It was also built a century ago. Pretty damn good, if you ask me. "
"There's an intercom button in the cars that should enable you to talk with the conductor. If you thought he was seriously injured you could pull the brake once you're in a station (very few scenarios where it's appropriate between stations, this obviously isn't one of them)"
 Go to SuitSupply on Broome Street or Madison Ave and the sales associates will help you out. I had a great time there. A decent starter suit will run you ~ 600 after alterations if I remember correctly.
I like Dough for fancy and Peter pan for old school.
"Can I buy it from you when you leave in 10 days? :-D
