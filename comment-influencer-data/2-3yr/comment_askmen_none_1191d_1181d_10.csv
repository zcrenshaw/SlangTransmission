"Expectations.

This is kind of a corollary to the answer ""ego,"" which has been put forth my other commenters.

One thing that going on a ton of first dates taught me is that the stakes really aren't that high.  Obviously, you try to dress for the occasion, and maintain a positive attitude.  But if you and someone you *thought you liked* don't happen to hit it off right away: no big deal.  A first date (and really the next few that follow it) is about finding out whether your *hunch that you might like someone* may have been correct.  

Don't expect that, since you had a pleasant exchange of emails or texts, you'll necessarily have an amazing time in person.  

Don't expect that, since someone went out with you once, and appeared to have a good time, they'll necessarily be up for a second date.  

Don't expect anything.  If you go into any first date expecting one thing or another, you're setting yourself up for disappointment.  Allow yourself to be surprised, and challenge yourself to welcome negative surprises as you welcome positive ones.  Eliminating the wrong candidate doesn't exactly have to make you feel great, but realize that it nevertheless brings you closer (however slightly) to where you want to be.

I tell people to expect **only** that you'll try to have a good time with someone you hardly know, for at least an hour or two.  If something good happens after that: see where it takes you.  If the date turns awkward, or something embarrassing happens: make the best of the situation, any way you can.  

You have to let go of those daydreamed fantasies.  Learn to stop letting your thoughts run away with you.  ""Well, if the first date goes really well, then I'll have to outdo myself on the second date, and then how will I have money left to get her cousin a wedding gift, especially when I don't know who else she's thinking about inviting...""

*Stop.*  Switch it off.  Just get to know someone.  Let 'em get to know you.  **Be gracious**, at all costs.  Whatever happens, you're OK."
"Since you're friends, I'd ask her why she's charging escorts' rates without being one."
Intimacy.
These are the real hard-hitting questions that we really just don't see enough on this subreddit.
"I got tested when I was ~32.  Both Mrs and I got tested after several years of unprotected sex failed to result in 'accidentally' producing a pregnancy. 

No idea what caused sterility, but it's there.   

I was a little upset for a while, but never having to worry about pregnancy was a good alternative.   
Since Mrs died a couple years ago,  I'm sort of glad that I'm not raising any kids by myself.    

There are some mixed feelings, but I'm okay with who I am. 
"
"Lingerie is for you, not for me.
  
My ex is a lingerie designer. Lingerie is seen by most people as sort of a ""sex costume"" for women to turn on men. Women will pick out pieces that they think will turn their men on, but that's not how it works. Lingerie is supposed to turn you on. We don't give a shit about lace accents, color, fabric, etc, that's supposed to be for you. You put it on, you feel sexy, and that in turn will turn us on. When we see you in bed, in your lingerie, we get turned on because we're seeing something naughty, something that you were wearing for you and making you feel sexy.
  
Your clothes should be the same way. It should reflect the best of your personality and make you feel sexy and confident. That's why a tshirt and jeans is just as sexy as a short dress, because the woman wearing it feels comfortable in her own skin, and radiates that to everyone around her.
  
So don't wear things to turn us on, wear things that turn you on and we'll be turned on in the process."

"1: It's disrespectful not to go

2: You can't really be sure as of why she wants to talk, you have a probable outcome but you can't be sure. 

3: It's better for her and you to break up face to face than over a phone or text message. It asserts the idea that either A: it's over or B: It might still work. 

4: The heartbreak will be similar no matter how she breaks up with you. 


5: Alcohol 

6: Cause ~~I~~ **WE** want you to. 

7: Because having closure will allow you to move on like closing a book and opening a new one. Having an ending is very comforting. Constantly wondering what you could have done differently and saying it's your fault is considerably less comforting.


EDIT: Please, keep us posted though, you got me interested. "
"Well this turned from sad to sadder.

"Gonna play devil's advocate and throw out a few perspectives on why someone would find it important:

- For some guys, sex is a special, intimate thing. To them, it's an act that you only do with someone truly important to you, and that's the value they attribute to sex. When they meet a girl who's slept with many guys, he might think that the girl doesn't view sex the same way. Maybe to her, sex isn't a big deal, or she cares more about it feeling good than it being special. Maybe to her, sex is a bigger deal than love, since she's willing to partake in such a special act with anyone rather than a loved one.

- For some guys, they might think that a girl who's slept around a lot might have extravagant values and lifestyles. Considering the idea of a girl's sexuality is societally portrayed as having to be pure and such (meaning that girls who are sexually deviant are shamed for it), to meet a girl who goes against the grain and sleeps around is a girl who won't necessarily go along with rules. Maybe she's a girl who does other things that don't fit the image of a what a girl is ""supposed"" to be like, and that can be off-putting.

- For some guys, it's ego. When the girl hasn't had as many partners, he has a better chance of filling the role of ""best lover she's ever had."" When he's competing against numerous other guys for that role, it's harder to earn that title, especially if there are things he naturally can't match with other guys. (Dick side, willingness to partake in certain kinks, etc.) How is he supposed to be the best lover she's ever had if he has to do this and that to achieve it?

And the like. Are these views necessarily right or wrong? Not exactly; they're just beliefs, after all. For the guy who believes in sex being special, there are girls who think of sex in the same way that will match him well. Same for the other two examples. On the flip side, there are guys who believe the opposite who'd fit with a girl who's slept around a lot.

In the end, anyone is allowed to decide what they want in a partner, and this includes sexual history. If a guy wants to turn down a girl for her sexual history that involves sleeping with numerous guys, he's allowed to. If a girl wants to turn down a guy because he's a virgin and she wants someone experienced without having to teach him, she's allowed to. If you worry too much about why a subset of guys care so much, it'll have an impact on how you express your sexuality. Just do you and have as much or as little sex as you want; the right guy will be cool with it either way."
"Run! Run!

If you expect a guy will pay for everything, please go back to 1800. I'm ashamed of this kind of women. Always split or one day a man pays, next time a woman pays. 

If you expect to spend that much money, you need a reality check. On what do you even spend it on? Food, cinema, theatre, water park...?"

"Being snuggled up and getting as much skin on skin contact as possible during sex.

In porn, the shots are set up so the guy is outta the way so you can see the girl's goods while they're fucking. From a 3rd person view, this is great. But with actual sex, it just feels really good to be pressed up and feeling each other's warmth."

"A penis doesn't come with an on/off switch. It doesn't get hard or soft on demand. If a guy can't get hard, it doesn't mean it's broken or that he doesn't like you. It a guy gets hard at an inopportune time, it doesn't mean he's doing it on purpose."
Just take the goddamn initiative.
"I'm going on a booze cruise with my ex which she got me as a birthday gift. Why? Mostly because I am an idiot.

aahahaha, shoot me.

Post cruise edit: Alright lads, so here is what happened...

We met up Friday afternoon to head to the cruise. It was byob so i brought a cooler as I **knew** I was gonna need to be super drunk for this. Anyway, we grab lunch before heading to the cruise since I was hungry. She's making a few semi-sexual comments every now and again etc etc. (oh boy here we go) We head to the cruise, its actually pretty fun, lots of drinking, dancing, singing. About halfway through the cruise (she's a lightweight so she's fairly drunk by now) she kisses me. I mean, Im not going to pretend like I resisted.... because I didnt. The first time we kissed since we broke up 5months ago. All i could think was ""ah fuck, here I go with the feelings again"". 

Anyway, cruise ends and she asks whats the plan now. I mention a bar in my town (I do not live very close to her) that I am probably going to go to now and she says ""ok lets go"". By the time I get the uber to go to the bar I notice I am wayyyy past the point of even being able to function at the new bar so I tell her I am just going to my place instead. She says ok cool and away to my place we go...In the uber, she made a joke along the lines of ""I hope this uber doesnt get pulled over because I have expectations for tonight that need to be fullfilled."" I think all I said to that was ""oh yea..?"" but I am not too sure...Anyway we get to my place, proceed to have sex, it was as amazing as it always was with her. Wake up this morning and she looks like she's looking for something on my bed so I ask her what she's doing and she says she is ""looking for my dignity, because I clearly lost it"". Yea, you and me both sister. Do not know what happens from here but yea.....I am not a smart man at all."
"Yes and no, I wouldn't.

Army buddies paid for it for me on my birthday overseas in Korea, I said 'why not'?  The experience was a really weird mix, the girl was pretty much bored.  

I chalk it up to experience.  Tried it, wasn't thrilled, didn't really enjoy contributing to the sex trade, and it lacked almost everything I enjoy about sex."

"Well, I recently received a letter in the mail containing a formal invitation to touch my girlfriend's butt this upcoming weekend. Attached was a ""boyfriend report card"", with various subjects that were graded on both comprehension and performance. The report card was new, but I get letters in the mail every so often. She doesn't tell me when she's going to do it, so it's always this really nice surprise. "

It's such a change from the last boyfriend I had. Disgustingly cute but I love it. And I'm learning to let go of my insecurities at the same time. If he wants to show me off to the world, then I'll be the best version of myself I can be for it!"

"Broke up with my girlfriend on Wednesday.

Tonight I'm going to go to a shitty punk show in a dive bar. She never enjoyed going to those with me. I'm also going to drink a fuck ton. 

Tomorrow, I'm going to hang out at the brewery that my friends own. I am most likely going to drink a fuckton. 

Sunday, I will hit the gym, do some meal prep for the week and probably revive my OkCupid account, or just say fuck it and play Overwatch until my eyes fall out of my head. Either way. "
"She's amazing. She's incredibly caring, smart, profoundly intelligent even though she doesn't think so, smart, funny, fun, loving, interesting, complex, and unimaginably beautiful.

Why the shovel? So she can go dig gold elsewhere."
"You turned him down, so it's on you to make the first move now if you want this to happen. If you want to date him, ask him out on a date.

Just remember that there's a chance he's moved on and isn't interested anymore."
"Well I used to drink heavily and spend a lot of time alone, but after ending up with a gun in my mouth and being too chickenshit to pull the trigger, I decided that was probably not the best way to handle things. 

These days I deal with it by focusing as much of my time and energy on my training (competitive powerlifting) and spending time with friends and family. Basically I just throw myself into life and distract myself as much as possible. I found that things got really bad when I gave myself opportunities to just sit and dwell on it, so I remove all chances for that. "
That she doesn't have a professional job.
"A cat. I had a 15 year old cat that became my now ex's almost upon meeting. Ex had scratching skills and was a very sound sleeper that pretty much never moved. So the cat would cuddle with her all night (I move around a lot so the cat never slept in bed with me). My cat started following my girlfriend around and became quite devoted. It became apparent that my cat was a traitor, and was now my girlfriends cat:( 

Fast forward a few years to our breakup, she wanted to confirm she could keep the cat that now pretty much ignored me and clearly preferred her. How could I refuse?"
"I hate to put a damper on the fun and adventurous taboo nature of happy ending massages, but 95% of the time, the people giving these massages are being trafficked here illegally and forced to do it.

Turns out that isn't the case for them, and they're forced to give handjobs and don't get paid for shit, and can't go back or report it because the people in charge of them threaten to kill their families.

"When she just plays with it during foreplay. Not like full on jacking off but when she's just giggling and wagging it around.

Also, laughing during sex. Just like dumb stuff. Example - I fall off the bed or whatever and she just gets on top while laughing at me while still on the floor.

EDIT - to add while on the fllor"
"We say ""hi"" to each other. All the time. Pretty much every silence involves at least one exchange of ""hi""s. It started when one of us would catch the other looking at us, but now it's when we pass each other in our apartment hallway, or when we're sitting across a table holding hands. Even our friends are used to it now; we'll walk into a friend's party together, greet everyone with hugs and kisses, grab a drink, find our way back to each other -- ""hi."" We even say it when initiating sex.

I think it's a ""you're cute and I love you"" kind of ""hi."""

"My husband and I went to a hole in the wall massage place in our neighborhood a few years back. We both got massages and were separated by a curtain. 

The woman doing his massage tried to start rubbing his junk. He flipped out, got off the table, opened the curtain and was like ""sorry. Get dressed, time to go.""

I had no idea what had happened until we were walking home. He explained, really worried I'd be upset. I couldn't stop laughing."
I really don't care about some small thing you're worried about. We're naked together...we're gonna sex..the only thing likely to stop that is discovering a penis.  
"I found out just after my 29th birthday when I got a letter from my doctors office saying ""An analysis of your semen has shown no sperm present, indicating that your vasectomy was successful.""

"Spotify. I love it. I get to legally pay for my music, I can take it on the go, it's extremely good quality and I like that musicians do get some of my money and that fact that I might not like some albums that you'd pay a fairly large amount for.

She got really into it and started saying things like ""do whatever you want to me""  so... I did.  I moved further down and I ate that ass.  It was pretty awesome and she had multiple orgasms since I was also busy with my fingers elsewhere.  

About an hour after the event I got violently ill and started throwing up and having crazy diarrhea.  I called her and told her I got sick and that's when she was like ""Oh yeah by the way..."".

Men are no all automatic sex machines. Sometimes when we see boobs it does not equal instant boner. Sometimes we have intricate feelings too and sometimes it's ok for US to say no.

"SSD stands for ""solid state drive"" and is the part of your computer where information is stored. Think of it like the filing cabinet where your paperwork lives when it's not in use. RAM stands for ""random access memory"" and is like your desk space. It's where your paperwork goes when you're working on it. The more RAM (desk space) you have, the more things you can have spread out in front of you at once. You could work exclusively out of your filing cabinet, but it would be a lot slower. So you take things out of your hard drive and put them into your RAM to work on them. 

Now, how does an SSD differ from a spinning disk drive (the old standard)? A spinning disc drive works just like a record player. A needle moves over the surface of the drive until it finds the information you want. It takes time to get to exactly where the information is stored, and then you're limited by how quickly the disc can spin to read back all the data. It'd be like having your files stored on microfilm that you have to hunt around for the right file and transcribe it, even if you know generally where it is. 

An SSD would be like having a filing cabinet where you just touch the first letter of the file you're looking for and the right drawer instantly opens. You still don't want to work out of it exclusively and need to put it into RAM, but at least you can get at the file almost instantly and it takes WAAAAY less time. 

For most people, the bottleneck in using their computer is how quickly information can be retrieved from or stored to the hard drive. The processors (engine/brains) are fast enough to handle everything, it's just a matter of how quickly you can get to the info and save it again.

When you reboot your computer, you're effectively taking all the papers off your desk and putting them away so you can start with a clean slate, which is why a lot of us IT folk always recommend you reboot before calling. Sometimes, a file isn't where it's supposed to be, and rebooting puts everything back as best as the computer knows how - which is the problem 99% of the time. 

Hope that makes sense! Sorry for the novel. "

we both have a sexual history from before meeting each other and that's completely normal. I want to be able to talk openly with you about what we enjoy sexually, what we don't like, our fantasies, fetishes etc so we can have the most enjoyable sex possible for both of us. 

However, when we talk about this, I would prefer if we kept it about the acts that we like and left the people with who it happened out of it. 
The reason for that is that in this situation I can't help myself picturing you with other people and it makes me uncomfortable. I don't want to make you feel awkward by my being uncomfortable because it's completely normal for you to have had sexual partners before me. 
I feel like this will be the best way for us both to be satisfied sexually. Is that ok with you ?

"In college I was dating a girl who was very shy about her body.  She was 6'0 even and grew up with a lot of jokes about her height and so she kind of shied away from clothes that drew attention to herself.  

I loved her body and found her incredibly sexy.  One day, about 8 months into the relationship, we decided to go out of town for a night.  Rented a hotel room and drove about an hour away. Nowhere special, just somewhere we could relax.  The whole car ride she was nervous and I couldn't figure out why.  I tried to rub her shoulders, like I knew she liked, but she got defensive, so I backed off, thinking the worst.

Eventually we got to the hotel.  Smoked a bowl and she said she had to use the bathroom.  About 10 minutes later she came out wearing the sexiest lingerie I had ever seen.  Complimented her perfect.  She was nervous as hell, and apparently had worn it the whole ride to the hotel.  She was going to tease me in the car with it but got too nervous and panicked when I touched her shoulder, thinking I would feel it underneath her clothes and get disgusted.

"as a girl, the huge red flag is ""All my friends are guys because I don't trust girls.""

It means she's untrustworthy. That's why she doesn't trust girls, she's projecting her own behavior on them and through some miracle she's not projected that onto guys, probably because she's kinda cute and that's her only source of power, not to mention companionship.

Pro tip right there"
"I have. Like a month after my breakup. I was an emotional mess. I went to a massage parlor and got my dick sucked. I asked to fuck her but she did not want to. Felt good to get my dick sucked on the moment but felt like shit after. 

EDIT: It did cost me 160$. 60$ at the entrance and 100$ to get my dick sucked. It was in Montreal. The place was clean and the broad was actually quite attractive. "
"&gt; I've learned to take OP's advice. I, like most men, trained myself to orgasm quietly. This is how we can masturbate so often as teenagers while in a house full of other people

Yeah, this happens to women too when we're teenagers. Wonder how I got anything else done...

"As a guy, you can expect to kiss zero girls if you never go in for the kiss. 

Now before you debunk that as a false absolute, which it is, that is to mean that most girls are out there waiting to be plucked. They almost all feel like you. You won't meet the ones that don't in a meaningful way unless you get some experience and confidence, and for that, you gotta go steal some hearts.

Don't buy into this hope will make good things happen bullshit Hollywood sells us. The world doesn't give a shit about any of us. If we want good things to happen, we need to *make* them happen.

"I don't have much personally, but I remember an old buddy/roomate and I went on a double date with a pair of girls who were also roomates back in college.  It was more of a friends-type relationship with the girl I was with, but the other (very attractive) girl was laying it on heavy with my buddy.  We end up at the strip club till maybe 1AM then head back.  I'm tired and didn't have any strong intention with my gal, so we drop the girls off and head home.  He gets a text at something like 3AM from the very attractive girl saying he forgot to give her a massage that was the prize in some bet he lost.  So he heads over there.  This is a shoe-in, right?


He comes back an hour or so later.  Turns out he gave her a massage, and then she pulls out an air mattress from her closet.  It was for him to sleep on because she has a boyfriend.  Keep in mind we all went out to the bars, they insisted on going to the strip club, the girl tells him to come over at like 3AM for a massage...  and that's literally all she wanted.  "
Saw one porn video that was basically a tutorial taught by a few big name pornstars on how to eat out girls properly.  I tried some of the techniques on my wife and I've never had my hair grabbed that hard in a good way before.  Also almost had my head crushed by her thighs so I'd say it worked out well in my favor.

"Being passive when it comes to dating. Society doesn't expect women to make the first move in asking someone out; relationships can just ""happen"" for many of them, as if it were magic.

Another thing is the ability to always have friends who can give you deep emotional support, as there is not as much of a stigma for women to let out their emotions. For guys, beyond a SO or family, we often don't have many people who we can open up our emotions to, which can make us feel utterly alone and frustrated. I think this is a major reason why the ""forever alone"" feeling seems to be much more common among men than  women."

"As I understand it, the theory goes like this.

If another woman wants you, then that proves your worth. While you are in a relationship, you have the stamp that you are worth being in a relationship with.

That makes you valuable.

Think of it this way. Single guys have never been deemed worthy of being in a relationship with, or the last girl they were with deemed them unworthy and left them.

Only those in a relationship are consistently being deemed worthy.

Does that make sense?"
"Flip the script. If a woman you knew had just lost a child and was being emotionally manipulated by a dude, cornered and told no one else is going to love her, given no sympathy, comfort, understanding, or space to mourn her child, wouldn't you tell her to get the fuck away from this person and not look back? Apply this to yourself. She knows you're weak and is going in for the kill. Get out!

Edit: And don't fucking let her talk you into having a baby with her as a way to ease your pain!"

"bitch, this aint chipotle"
Lol.  This guy is learning what growing up is like.  
"When I was 20 I met this girl at a party. And we dated for about 10 months. Everything seemed really cool but there would be times where she just wouldn't text me back or ignore my phone calls while being obviously active on social media (the tell-tale signs, I know). Initially we were meeting up moderately and going on dates but that started to really dwindle down, she started texting me during weird hours of the night and only wanted to meet up in the AM. Even when it came to giving me box, she acted funny about it. She'd randomly be rude, condescending, and when I would buy her little gifts, she would just give off a vibe that she didn't care. 

So one day while I was at my friend's house she called me at about 2 a.m. She asked me if I knew where she could find a gun. I asked her why would she need one? She replied by saying well my ex just showed up at her place and wanted to talk about their relationship and he got mad and threw her out of his car and then choked on the ground outside her place. So I told her to file a police report and she did. I also told her to take pictures of any bruises out scratches she he gave her and she hesitated when answering me back

Her day in court finally came against him and I went with her. To this day that was one of the top 5 biggest surprises I have ever experienced in my life. I'll break down the highlights:

1. He wasn't her ex, it was just a recurring casual situation

2. He broke it off months ago but she kept pursuing him

3. She couldn't handle him breaking it off so she kept buying lavish gifts and sending them to his house. (she bought him a 500$ watch with both their initials engraved into it) he brought it to court as evidence that she wouldn't leave him alone

4. She would show up at his job and places he would hang out just to try to catch him

5. The night that he randomly ""showed up"" at her place, she called him and begged him to come over. He brought a printout of his call log for proof

6. She willingly got into his car to talk, didn't like what she was hearing from him, jumped out the car and slammed the door so hard that she broke the locking mechanism. He filed a claim in court against her for it. 

7. She didn't have any proof of him assaulting her but he showed up with picture proof of scratches on his own neck. 


All in all, he got on that stand and made her look like a deranged bootycall that couldn't take no for an answer. The judge dismissed the restraining order she had on him because he wanted nothing to do with her. And there I was in court next to a crying pathological liar looking like the fucking dope I truly was for believing anything that ever came out of that girl's mouth.

"Perceiving just about every facet of dating as a serious, borderline existential risk. 

If I see a cute girl, and I want to go talk to her, my brain shuts down that idea immediately. In the moment, there isn't really any conscious thought that goes into it. My mind just treats the idea of talking to a girl the same way it treats the idea of doing jumping jacks in a busy road: *what the fuck, you fucking idiot? Of course we're not doing that! Do you want to die? Do you want to DIE? Sit down and shut up!* It's very difficult to ignore what feels like a survival instinct.

It's only after the fact that I start critically analyzing myself in a desperate attempt to justify that thought process."

"Not a problem.   

Pancreatic cancer.    
She felt minor stomach discomfort and back pains - both intermittently for a few months before diagnosis.   Since she was a nurse, she was sometimes a little too self-sufficient, plus she had MS for 10+ years leading her to ignore minor or transient pain.    

It didn't get unbearable until Christmas eve, and as soon as I heard 'pancreatic mass' I knew it was over.   The oncologist tried chemo, but the first session nearly killed her outright.    
They did the basics to make her comfortable, draining fluid from the belly, heart, lungs... plus lots of pain meds.    She came home for hospice late January, and died in my arms near the end of February.    Total about 8 weeks from initial diagnosis to dead.    

While pancreatic cancer isn't terribly common, my unrelated ""uncle"" has been suffering for about a year with this, passing about a month before her diagnosis.    A girl that my wife grew up with died the same month as her from it, and a childhood neighbor of mine was just given the bad relapse news after fighting about 18 months.    
It seems very painful, but also very quick for some."

"That all you have to do to be attractive is ""be yourself and don't be a mysoginist"".

Every week there's a new article on HuffPo about the horrors of dating as a female, because of all the terrible men out there. On nearly every sub you'll find women lamenting that whenever they go on tinder and okcupid they're assaulted by dick pics and skeezy sex proposals. The prevailing public perception of college dating is that it's a minefield of douchey frat bros who will try to rape women and get away with it.

Absorbing this narrative day in day out, an average guy would reasonably think to himself ""Huh. So many awful dudes out there. Well I'm not awful so just by that virtue alone, I should be a hot commodity. After all, it seems that men like me are hard to find.""

But a lot of these men still find themselves loveless and lonely and their emotions turn into frustration and anger after a while. ""Well I keep reading that every other guy out there is a dick-pic sending socially stunted sexist, so why don't women appreciate me? Why am I still alone and constantly rejected?!""

The hard truth is, despite the hysteria that women and mass media have perpetrated, most men are good blokes who just want to do well in this world. Most men treat women nicely. Most men are fairly respectful. Most men have at least a basic social and etiquette awareness.

So in reality you're not that special, you've just bought into the selection bias. When women cry about mysoginists, they don't mean most of their interactions are like that. Maybe 10/100 guys they've met are like that, but those 10 are memorable in a bad way and that's why those are the guys everyone hears about. The remaining 90 guys are forgettable average men and so girls just don't even remember them.

Bottom line - most men are good people, so being a nice/respectful guy isn't winning you extra points. What will win you points is charm, assertiveness, muscular tone, height (if you've got it), social status, etc."

Gifts aren't always exactly what you want (if they were meant to be, we'd all just give cash 100% of the time). Gifts are supposed to be indicative of the person's love/understanding of you. If your wife planned something that you *do* like, then she got it right even if it isn't your #1 choice."

"Having recently separated from a crazy girl I'll give you some of the more subtle insights I noticed:

* If she has nothing positive to say about any of her past relationships. As /u/alnicoblue said:

   &gt; ""You're so different than the assholes I normally date.""

  If everyone you date is an asshole, there is only one common factor.
* Emotional manipulation when discussing anything, especially how you feel about each other. E.g. 

  &gt; ""I apologise very much for hurting you. I honestly didn't think it would bother you, as you're not interested in me.""

 That is a except from my recent separation. Any of this 'baiting you into saying what they want to hear' is a big sign of insecurity and possibly something more under the surface.
* Adults that are cannot have a sensible discussion about their relationship (i.e. two people calmly and openly communicating and listing to how each other feels). Not someone that is entitled and only open to their way of thinking. In other words, someone incapable of compromise.
* Lastly, paranoia. If she is constantly asking you not to do anything with the sexy photos she sent you, or checking your phone/socials to see who you have been contacting.

The sex may be mind-blowing with the crazy ones, but eventually you're going to have a bad time."

"It actually worked out fine. This cat always played 2nd fiddle to my obnoxiously loud attention whore of a siamese. I guess she resented me for that.

"For anyone who isn’t a natural with girls the ultimate thing you have to sacrifice is **comfort**. If you only do what's comfortable you will never succeed with women. Yes, it's more comfortable to avoid social events and venues because you don't like dancing or drinking. Yes, it's more comfortable not to approach women because you're scared of rejection. Yes, it's more comfortable to wish you had a better body or a better job or were better at speaking instead of actually working for those skills. Yes, it's more comfortable to complain that life is unfair, the dating scene is unfair, other people have it better, and you have such a tough life.

None of that is going to make you successful with women. If anyone of you put a few solid months of real work doing things outside of your comfort zone and turning them into things you are comfortable with you would get infinitely more results than reading and asking for advice over and over again from the comfort of your computer desk.

"&gt;- For some guys, sex is a special, intimate thing. To them, it's an act that you only do with someone truly important to you, and that's the value they attribute to sex. When they meet a girl who's slept with many guys, he might think that the girl doesn't view sex the same way. Maybe to her, sex isn't a big deal, or she cares more about it feeling good than it being special. Maybe to her, sex is a bigger deal than love, since she's willing to partake in such a special act with anyone rather than a loved one.

Thank you. This is exactly how I feel and I don't act like a hypocrite and sleep around myself. That said, if you want to sleep around, more power to you! You shouldn't slut shame women that want to do that but you should be allowed to not want to date them. I hate that people seem to get mad that I wouldn't date a girl with too many partners and act like I'm being an asshole."

"i had one for a while. we dated last summer. we went for long walks in the park. we listened to a carl sagan audiobook in her basement with the lights off. it was unlike anything i've ever experienced before. she was gorgeous and intuitive. she liked feminism and liberal politics. i could imagine her ideal world. i wished to experience it.

we were both hesistant and submissive. one day she grabbed my hand and held it. my heart raced. i've never been in love like that before. i felt like i was on a different planet when i was with her.

we broke things off when she went back to school. it got complicated. i talked to her again but we didn't get along anymore. things escalated as i tried to stir them in the right direction. i didn't pressure her or anything. we argued over something unimportant. we haven't talked since. i thought about her everyday for 8 months.

i saw her on tinder a week ago. her bio said ""hold my hand""."
"I think this question calls for a post of its own.

You want to move from ""steady dating"" to ""planning for a shared future,"" yeah?

A lot depends on how long you've been seeing the same person.  What's your read on her feelings, and her intentions, with regard to you?

Suppose you've been together for a year.  You like each other a lot, and you're together all the time.  For a lot of couples, moving in together represents a good intermediate step between ""meeting the parents"" and ""getting engaged.""  It doesn't (and shouldn't be construed to) bind you to anything, or create some contract.  But lots of people find that it's an effective way of figuring out whether you can really tolerate your partner as much as you'd have to, if you were to get married.

So how do you bring that up?  Maybe one of you is on a lease that's ending, and you broach the topic in a context of ""just helping to make sure I've got my plans for the next year straight.""  

Actually, don't do that.  You can *say* that, but don't say *only* that.  It's too matter-of-fact.  If you're going to make the suggestion, it should be something you want to do badly enough that you're prepared to show most (or all) of your cards.  You should be ready to say something as bold as, ""I enjoy spending time with you so much that I'd like to spend a majority of my time with you.""  If they're not ready to move in: *It's OK*.  But in that event, you'll already have opened a conversation about your relationship.  There could be no better time than this to get a sense of what she *has* got in mind for the two of you.  If she'd rather not move in together right now, how confident is she in the relationship?  If one of you took a job out of state, would the other be willing to relocate, in order to preserve the relationship?  Et cetera.

This is treacherous territory.  People's failure to be consistently open about their intentions can lead to some brutal disappointments, when they learn too many things they don't expect to, all at once.

But I'll tell you what: You'll never be sorry you let someone know how much you care for them.  How much you want to be in their life, and how happy it makes you to imagine them in your life, for the foreseeable future.  If they don't return your feelings, in the way you'd hoped, it'll sting.  So what?  If you crash what had appeared to be a stable, strong relationship by liking someone too much, then *who the fuck needs it?*"

"One of my favorite things to do during sex is to kiss and lick my girlfriend's breasts, which obviously causes my head to be in that area. The warmth there is nice and cozy, and I get to hear her heartbeat, which seems to beat faster when I say ""I love you"". Such a beautiful and intimate experience, and 10/10 is just not high enough to describe how great it feels."
"i think you would need to acknowledge that you rejected him in the past in order to make it abundantly clear that you're changing that stance. Also, directly do the work to set up a date - don't leave the ball in his court.

He may say no. Be ready to take that gracefully."
That's how I feel. What's even worse is that I asked her if the $300 a month she pays for her car is a lot of money. Her answer was YES. So I told her how do you expect a guy that spend at least double that on you.
Can confirm.. that thing has a mind of its own..
"Maybe he had bad experiences, it's his life, let him do whatever he wants."
Just because I ejaculated doesn't mean we are done. The orgasm can still last for several seconds after. So keep fucking going. 
"&gt;If you expect a guy will pay for everything, please go back to 1800.

This is really the key part; reading the title I thought OP meant individually, in which case there's a mentality mismatch money-wise. I'm in NYC and just a Broadway show + dinner can easily add up to $150+ each. I'd be happy to do that occasionally - I even do that with friends sometimes -  but I expect my date to put in her fair share."
"At least for me, sex is a prerequisite for romantic love.

Women seem to make all sorts of faulty assumptions, like ""sex is the most important thing!"" ""you only want sex!"" ""she's just a sex object to you!"" ""you think sex and love are the same thing!"" When it's far simpler than that.

Sex makes romance possible but doesn't guarantee romance. No (or bad) sex guarantees no romance. This sex to romance connection is over short time periods, not long time periods. That's it. It's not complicated."

Reading these comments makes me feel extremely lonely 
"Well, answering for myself...

1. I'm religious, so, y'know...

2. If she's got high numbers, we probably aren't compatible

3. I'm a virgin, and ignoring all the jokes and such, I'm sensitive about it. When you get down to brass tacks, besides people with fetishes or other virgins, it isn't that common for people to want to be someone's first. 

4. While I'm a virgin, I know enough about myself to know that I get attached easily, and sex won't help with that. If her numbers are up there a bit, she very well might expect sex, and I'm going to hold back until I know she's going to give me more than a couple of weeks or a month before she breaks it off."

"I'll pitch you a situation. 

First thing that hits you is the stench of rotten alchoholic piss, it's on the floor, the sinks, the walls, some off it dried, some of it puddled up on the floor. 

There's a no name hair metal band playing over the intercom. Some how over the years it's been abused and the speaker is scratchy. You push open the door to the only stall with a functional door, there's a used condom caked on the floor and a huge pile of fetid shit in the clogged toilet. So you switch stalls and hope no one comes in. 

A minute or so later a guy wanders in  falls in to the stall next to you and starts violently vomiting. 

Over the sounds of the plopping, the sobbing, and the wet, squelching queefs of your 'conquest', your eye keeps getting drawn to the graffiti; a crudely drawn image of an evil eyed mickey mouse masturbating onto a kilroy with a swastika carved into his forehead. 

You can't even take a shit in there without a hazmat suit and you want to go in there and fuck some random truck stop hooker who probably wants to steal your kidneys? Can you even maintain an erection in those circumstances? 

I don't care who invites me into that stall, I'm not going in there.

"Yeah I have, a couple of times about 4 years ago.  


A friend of mine was in from out of town and was telling me about how he went to get a massage and the lady got naked and gave him an amazing rub down.  I thought this sounded awesome so I investigated some of the local suspect massage places.  I remember my friend had lived above one for a couple of years in the gay village, so I visited the website. There was more information there than I was hoping, pics and bios of the girls, when they were on shift and how much the room cost.  So I picked a night with a bunch of hotties working and went in with some cash.  



So when you walk in there is a lady at the front desk, and you can ask to see who's available for massages at the moment. One by one they'll come out and introduce themselves and after you oget to pick which one you want.  You then pay for access to the massage room at the front desk, I paid for 45 minutes of massage goodness! 


Some of the rooms are pretty lavish with jacuzzi and themes, but I just got a pain old room with a shower and lots of mirrors. Before you shower, the masseuse comes in and asks you what you're looking for. The options were straight nude massage or  thai (aka happy ending). I obviously chose full Thai, paid her,  and then jumped into the shower. She helped dry me off and then led me to the table, face down.  The first 20-25 minutes were just like your standard massage, just with a  smoking hot masseuse in some sexy lingerie.


Then when she turned me over, it got really hot.  She was on top of the table, straddling me and grinding against my cock. She then whispered into my ear that I could touch her any where I want, except for her pussy. So I went to fucking town, grabbed her ass, licked her nipples and motor boated her huge tits. After 10-15 minutes of her grinding against me, she slowly moved down to my cock and started to jerk me off. Her technique was fucking spot on, she had a firm grip on the bottom of my cock while her other hand was responsible for the stroke. After been teased by this masseuse for 35 minutes, it was pretty easy for her to get the me off, and she stroked me through a huge orgasm. The cum went a little bit everywhere, so she cleaned what was left on me and I jumped in the shower to clean up.  


Overall it was a great experience, I would recommend it to all those who are curious. When I left the parlour I felt like a million bucks,and I stayed in this mindset for the rest of the day. You'll probably drop between 150-200$. 


 This was a classier massage joint so I think things could be different other places, but the girls I saw didn't look haggard or worn out, and the girl who massaged me was quite happy to be there and seemed pretty normal while we were small talking during the first half of the massage. I ended up going back to the same girl again later that summer but then got a girlfriend so I shut it down.

And when the final results came in that I couldn't have kids, I got a divorce. I have accepted the fact that I cannot have my own offspring. Dating afterwards was hard since many women want children, and dropping that bomb was a deal breaker. But now I have been dating a single mom for 1.5 years with a 9 yr old.

Just knowing that she enjoyed me sexually without sex made me so much more relaxed, it made me feel wanted, and the intimacy made me feel wanted. To me it was an emotional issue. To some guys it may be more physical and they may require more foreplay. Either way, talk with your partner and ask how you can help. It would mean a lot.

I'm also enjoying having no obligations to another person at the moment, and I like being free to do what I want with little repercussion for another person besides myself.

"Cause guys don't want to be #77. 

As a decent looking girl all you really have to do to get laid is got to a bar and tell a few guys you want to get laid. As a guy if you did that you'd get slapped. As a guy getting laid is difficult, even good looking, charming, put together guys struggle to get laid when they're single. So a guy that gets laid a lot is a high value guy that girls are very interested in. A girl that gets laid a lot is just a girl that wants to get laid a lot. There's nothing wrong with either but it's not the same thing.

With that said, guys prefer girls who are more selective on who they fuck, even going as far as wanting girls who only have sex in serious relationships. They want it to be special to them, they don't need to be the only one ever, but they don't want to be #77 on your fuck list.

It's the equivalent to a girl wanting a guy to be a bit guarded with commitment. If you met a guy who fell hopeless in love with any girl who talked to him, who pathetically confessed his love to girls on the 1st date, who seemed to have been ""in love"" with every girl he knows at some point, you might find him sexually repulsive. You might not want to date a guy who claims he loves you when he's also claimed he loved 76 other girls in the past. And that's fine."

"As a girl who met her boyfriend on Tinder (and messaged him first), here's what stood out to me:

1) Clear pictures of who YOU are -- none of this ""pick one out from the blurry group photo"" shit. 

2) Multiple photos of you doing stuff -- show me your interests.

3) PERFECT SPELLING AND GRAMMAR. I cannot emphasize enough how important this is! This is your first impression to a woman -- write like you know what you're saying, don't fuck up simple grammar, and for fuck's sake, know the difference between your, you're, their, there, and they're. 

4) A bio that intrigues -- whether that's an interesting quote, a cool fact about you, an unconventional place you've lived...whatever. But almost every guy on Tinder loves being outdoors, craft beer, his dog, and playing video games. What makes you different? What makes you date-able? If you have nothing written in your bio, you better believe I'm swiping left.

5) State your intentions and be honest about it. If you're just in it to hook up, great -- there are a bunch of women also there to hook up. If you're looking for a relationship, friends with benefits, non-monogamous situation, etc., just be clear. 

Hope that helps!

EDIT: For anyone who's curious, my boyfriend is attractive, but not THE MOST attractive guy I've ever been with (at least by conventional standards). We didn't have sex until we'd already been seeing each other for about two months. I did go through a series of hookups with other dudes before meeting Boyfriend, but all of them also fit the above criteria.

This is why I can't behind the sex positivity movement.

"Bar back, and then bartender. Only worked a day or two a week, pretty easy job and the perks were great. I'd work normally one weekday per week and one weekend night like 2x a month.

Lab flunky, and then lab manager. Mostly started doing setup work for a biology lab. Washing glassware, filling micropippeter tips, sanitizing them in the autoclave. Eventually was trusted with mixing reagents, ordering supplies, keeping the lab stocked basically. 

I also tutored athletes in Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Math. 200 level and below though only. Football and basketball players normally were in HS level remedial type classes, but I did have at the end a few smarter kids who were in 100-200 level classes that needed help by the time I was a senior. Did that for like 5 hours a week only.

I'd say on an average week between my jobs I'd work about 10-15 hours depending on the week. Kept me busy and put money in my pocket for doing the fun part of college. My parents paid for tuition and my room/board, so this was mostly funding my partying habits, buying clothes, and ancillary expenses. "

"&gt; I'm too shy to ask a girl out.

All the rest of your post is unnecessary, I feel. It's hard/painful for you to approach, possibly even excruciating as it triggers decades of stress and worry inside you, so you feel some resentment over being expect to do it and maybe you rationalise how you would like things to work out ideally (random meeting and equality and shit). The standard advice is to get over your shit, which is unhelpful in my opinion.

My personal advice for shyness is just talk to *everyone*. Girls, boys, old, young, hot, not.

If you *only* approach hot girls, you can feel nervous, conceited, afraid of rejection and desperate, and you'll come across that way. If you talk to someone you *don't* want to fuck/date, just someone in a shop or wherever, or just chatting a little on the phone when you call customer support or whatever, you'll at worst feel just nervous. It's a much lower bar to clear, and if you plan to just exchange one or two sentences you can know the interaction will soon end with little at stake. Then you get into the practice of just talking to people. If I wanted to be cringe inducing, I'd say it's like grinding xp on boars so you can then take on dragons.

Another ex wanted to see what all the hype about oily tits was about so we tried it out. It looked ridiculous, but they felt amazing.

"The sex itself can obviously be whatever you want it to be, but I'm going to try and break down the appeal of real sex and intimacy to you. 

It's the feeling of being in complete control of someone else's pleasure. It's the feeling of having someone else be completely in control of your pleasure. It's the feeling of blood pumping through every part of you. It's the fact that it's hot, *really hot*, you get sweaty or if it's winter you don't feel cold. It's feeling their skin on yours. It's reaching down and grabbing her waist and feeling like you're holding her entire being. It's looking directly in her eyes and *knowing* that she wants it too. It's the sounds she makes because she can't help it. It's making sounds you'd never be comfortable making anywhere else and seeing her react. It's wanting to put your mouth on every inch of her. It's teasing but knowing that the teasing will come to an end. It's feeling like you are in one of those ridiculous romantic sex scenes but somehow it's not ridiculous. It's feeling like that person is *yours*. If you're lucky, it's watching someone you really care about experience something amazing while you do too; like you've both just tasted your favourite flavour of ice cream for the first time. It's not wanting to be anywhere else afterwards. It's feeling sleepy and just surrounding yourself with that other amazing person who you just did that amazing thing with. It's falling asleep feeling like the sexiest, greatest person who ever lived. 

It's waking up and doing it all again...

Sorry, I got a little carried away :)"
"I'm a male teacher In Canada(gr. 7-12). I mentioned I'm Canadian because I'm not sure if the profession has as much respect in the US as here, It is a very decently paying middle class profession here, and most of us have 1-2 degrees before joining. 

Frankly, it is awesome. I tended to use something my students did as conversation small-talk, and women always seemed to react positively when finding out my profession. I'm a large, gym-obsessed powerlifter type, so it definitely gives me a more teddy-bear like, less-threatening side when first meeting women.

There is a very good chance that the stable, awesome guy that you are looking for right now was stable and awesome X years ago when you were ""going out and having fun"". He was probably looking for someone to spend his life with then. 

So now that you (broadly speaking) have had your fun, he is suddenly good enough? Honestly, it probably makes a lot of stable guys feel like a consolation prize. No man wants to feel that way.

And this doesn't even go into things like the fact that now that this hypothetical man is in more demand he can be a lot more picky in who he decides to pair up with. "

"That's very untrue for me, on the whole - the exception being that a woman is often sexiest in what she is most comfortable in.

I definitely do notice a lot of things about lingerie, and it is a huge turn-on. Additionally I do prefer short dresses/skirts on girls vs jeans/t-shirt - not to say that a girl in the latter has no effect on me, but it doesn't turn me on like the former."

"Probably the more articulate way he could express his preference is that many white women don't understand him, his family and his culture, and he wants someone who knows what it means to be non-white.

At first I thought ""Well, It's just a compatibility issue."" But after a while you just have to look in the mirror and find out where the problem is actually stemming from.

I love being alone. Not exclusively in a relationship context either, I mean in general. Being alone provides me a comfort not afforded by almost any other act in life. I've found that when I do enter a relationship I end up resenting the person because they're impeding on ""my time"" and even if I asked for room it would never be enough. I'd just want more. I always want more.

So I stopped. Figured I'd done enough harm to people emotionally (myself included) deleted Facebook, Twitter, snapchat, Instagram, and bought a kindle.

"As a woman, I despise ""be a man"" and all similar comments used to tell guys to suppress emotions or not care about something. I heard these comments growing up but never realized the impact they had on men until I was in college and had adult male friends. I have known so many guys that clearly struggle to identify, let alone express emotion in a healthy way. It's heartbreaking to see adults who, when asked what's wrong they can't answer because they don't know how to label or describe their own emotions. They know they're acting a certain way, but they can't explain why let alone figure out how to make the unpleasant feelings go away. I hate it.

Same thing I said in the post about women with crazy hair: nothing about them personally except that they probably aren't gainfully employed in a professional setting.
"I'm not proud of it, but I do have prejudices about this sort of thing based on experience. It makes me think that they don't see themselves as interesting enough to remember them without the neon hair. It makes them seem like they are needy and want attention. It gives me the impression that they're struggling with notions of conformity and adulthood, and the hair is feeble attempt at rebellion. I'm more likely to see them as unstable. It leads me to suspect there is a lot of emotional baggage in trail. It is unlikely that they have no corporate ambition (which is fine, neither do I.)

Sadly, these things have often been true when I have encountered them. But because I'm polite, courteous and generally friendly I've got to know quite a few girls like this. There are some who don't fit the above prejudices, but most have at least one of the above traits, usually more.

Everyone has the right to present themselves in any way they choose, but in the real world you have to accept that people are going to make prejudgements about you based on your appearance, and a great many of them will act on those prejudices and treat you differently. It is an unfortunate fact that many struggle to come to terms with."

She is flawed and infuriating. Our arguments are intense, our convictions stubborn, and our different perspectives difficult to contend with. There's so much pain involved with being in love with her.

But... she's an incredible human being. Generous beyond measure, cares in an extraordinarily rare way about those she loves. Her insights are profound. You can talk to her for 12 hours straight and it'll feel like you only just started. You can get lost in her eyes because being near her makes everything in your mind slow down and go quiet. You naturally want to give her the world and you genuinely believe her mere existence makes life better for those around her. No other woman compares to her looks. 

What little I was able to experience far outweighs the experience of anyone else I have ever desired. Probably the most important person in my life. 

Some day I'll need to move on, I'll have to, but until then... I honestly could not pick a better person to be in love with. It's been worth it beyond measure. "

Gramps complains about it to his grandson (who will inherit some of the money). He doesn't complain about it to me, his maid, his nurses, or his gardener. We'd just think, ""damn, people constantly soliciting you cause you have lots of money? Sure, that could get annoying, but it sounds like a very good problem to have!"""
"It's important to me because it puts things in context, and frankly, I'd never want to enter a LTR with someone who has fucked a lot of dudes/sucked a lot of cock. If it just a date or if we are FWBs? So long as you don't have an STD, I couldn't care less. I agree with most people in here: I simply wouldn't want to know.

But for relationships? I gave that a shot once and I got cheated on. Three of my friends also dated ""high previous partner count"" girls, and THEY all got cheated on. I don't think that someone who loves sex/sexual attention from a large amount/variety of guys all of a sudden stops loving that or craving that when they get ""into a relationship"", and I'm not one for an open relationship.

If you're at the altar, about to marry a girl, do you want that special kiss to be on a mouth that has eagerly pleased 50+ dicks in its past?"
"Hydration isn't a big deal until it's too late. I always carry around a disposable diner ketchup bottle full of water so that I can quickly give myself a water enema. It's the quickest way to absorb water into your body. The colon's primary function is to absorb the water out of your waste, so if you fill it with water you'll quickly get rehydrated. It's way easier and much more enjoyable than an IV.

"Pretty much the best thing I've learned is that women are generally as into sex as you are, and definitely have their own kinks and fetishes. They are just more reluctant to share them for fear of being deemed a freak or a slut."
"The whole ""women are no different than men"" thing really messed up my first few relationships.  I'm sure there are women out there fine with being told to ""walk off"" an injury (and men who are no OK with it), but in general treating my GFs like guys really didn't work out well.  "
"I think that I as a person did not change to a large magnitude.  I didn't start doing things I wouldn't usually do, like drugs, or I was suddenly Casanova after the first time with the amazing boost in confidence.  What weighed on my mind was that I was 23 and people who were 18 or even younger were having sex with people who cared about them or were attracted to them, and I had begun to feel ""defective"" as a man.  Like something was wrong with me. 

I wanted a meaningful experience, and seeing lots of people having casual sex with people who otherwise hurt them generated a lot of internal resentment, both towards others and myself.  People bash the ""nice guys"" thing a lot, but it is a hard mindset to pull yourself out of in some ways.  A guy known for cheating gets into a relationship with a great girl and cheats on her, you feel like he's throwing something away that you'd love to have.  He is having sex with not 1 more person than you, but two.  Also they are acting like shit, and you feel you're trying your best to be a good person, but you can't find relationships.

It really can easily build a negative mindset both towards yourself and others in an act of self-preservation for mentally dealing with how you don't feel sexually attractive to anybody you care about.

TL;DR:  Not having had sex as a guy, past a certain age can make you feel terrible, and that can generate unhealthy mindsets."

"I've found amateur is not only more entertaining, but more useful in this regard. For example, I saw a guy take his time and slowly drag his dick along his girl's clit before entering, as well as alternating between penetration and that move.

"Dude, the part where he's fucking her... you can see she's totally into it, and he's like the fucking king... pounding away at her pussy like it's a job interview, not a porno, she's lost... she doesn't know what to do with her hands... she holds onto the desk which makes it even more intense... and finally, she can't fucking hold on anymore... she's already given him what he needs... she's already broke character and told him she wants this to be more than a porno, she's seriously into him... he just keeps going, like a machine feeding off of her energy... she can't take it... he's fucking her stupid on this desk, to the point that she can't stop it anymore, she doesn't even want to, and then it happens... climax.  He know's it, feel it... she squeaks and her body reacts, squirting vaginal climax... that wasn't part of the plan, she wasn't ... I mean... she didn't mean to... but... SHIT! FUCK YOU! CUT!

I've got nothing left, just finish this... Oh yeah baby, cum on my what-the-fuck-ever and let's wrap this.

"When I was a teenager at an anime convention cosplaying for the first time, a group of girls around my age ran up to me with a guy friend in tow and asked me to make out with him. He was like 6'4"" and wearing cat ears. I did not make out with him, despite their insistence that ""he almost looks like a girl"". Fortunately that's the worst I got."
"Oh just you wait.

"I made friends with alcoholics, so I would always have drinking buddies. Not exactly healthy, but I never claimed to be.

Making relationships with guys doesn't really get any easier as you age. Most men you meet older than 25 come in one of four flavors.

* Depressed burnout spending all day drinking and giving up on life (That would be me).

* Super active 30-something dudebro who is always out doing stuff like concerts, sports, white water rafting, working out, or anything like that.

* Crazy motherfuckers who are incapable of building healthy relationships. These come in many variations, from old nerds, to the socially awkward, to the legitimately crazy.

* Married guys with families.

Of these, the burnouts tend to be the ones I personally gravitate to. They're usually a good combination of ""I need some friends"" and ""fuck it, I'll just drink alone"" that keeps them from being too overbearing or too noncommittal."
"I love old lady names like Fern. I might almost be tempted to name a child that, but I doubt the father would be down.  I'd have to dress her up as an [old woman](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/23/10/ca/2310cafba7b61d8053338451cf07bffb.jpg) for every photo. "
"Just watch the news together.  Everyone has something to say about the news.  It's outrage porn.  Finding out what outrages another person is a great window into their brain.  Say a news story about the war on terror comes on.  Doesn't matter if you're for it or against it, you're probably going to find out whether the girl is, and whether that is a red flag for you or not.  

The news is polarizing.  It gives you a clear idea of a person's personality and stability how they react to it."

"A pet rescue in my area was having a ""Pitty Party"" where pretty much any dog that looked even remotely pitbull-ish cost $20 out the door.  I traded a picture of Andrew Jackson for a new best friend.

"Every day.   I see him 1/3 of the time and the other 2/3 of the time i try to avoid seeing children his age, going into the toy aisles at stores, or even into his empty bedroom because it makes me feel depressed."
"Yes. She's a girl I was gonna date but moved across the world instead. I have a girlfriend who I am very happy with and who I like 1000x better but the fact that I never got to explore that other relationship makes it so every once in a while when she pops up on FB I can't help but wonder ""what would have happened."" "
"Also, lets be completely honest with ourselves here, past behaviors are the best indicator of future behaviors.

And if someone is looking for a relationship with someone they can respect and trust, guess what, having fucked a new guy every month is a trend that is likely going to want to continue, whether you're aware of it or not. While it's dumb to have some religious-like standard of no sex before marriage, it's equally fucking annoying to tell me that I should show the same respect to a promiscuous person as someone who focuses on studies, work, or just building stronger relationships with people than just hoping on the cockrousel. Impulse control is an important characteristic."

Example: Askreddit: ""Reddit, what did you do last weekend? (Except for my mom)"" and then the answers will be ""OP's dad"" ""OP's sister"" ""OP's brother"". That's just lazy recycling of the 'joke' OP already made.

2. Those posts that engage you in an interesting story and end with ""OP should have used serious tag."" I wish I could give multiple downvotes to those.

3. Rude behavior. I always downvote name-calling, for example."

"Here's a nonobvious one: whenever a woman would react badly to me, I assumed it was me. Turns out, sometimes it was me, but sometimes she was just having a bad day. Or I reminded her of someone she didn't like. Or she was surprised and reacted badly. Or the stars were misaligned. There's just no way to know. 

Now, if 10/10 women react badly to you, it's probably you. "

"Sweatshirts and boxers; I get to wear them when they are new...basically just to break them in for her. But after about the 6th wash, they ""magically"" end up on her clothing shelf/sleepwear drawer.

When I changed to boxer-briefs, she was not a happy camper...I told her to just buy her own boxers...like that was going to happen.

The loss that kind of caused me to examine this whole thing was a pair of promotional Gears of War boxers that she absconded with...those were actually damn comfortable; didn't ride up, pinch my sack or anything...I actually objected when she took those. But then she got me with the old ""puppy-dog eyes;"" goodbye GoW boxers...."

Thinking that whenever they say something to a girl, she's responding only out of courtesy, and is thinking to herself ''Does this guy really think that someone like me could be interested in someone like him? He's ugly and pathetic. Why is he asking me if I come to this bar often or do I listen to this band usually, when both of us know that it's just a ploy to get him talking to me, get my number, and eventually ask me out? Why doesn't he simply cut to the chase so I can reject him and be done with it?''"

"Extra spending money. When I don't have a girlfriend, I buy only a few things. Dip, passes at the wakeboarding park, gas, occasionally clothes and the majority goes into savings.

When I get a gf, I have to drive more so gas spending goes up, I usually pay on dates, so I cutout spending on clothing. No matter how much I like a girl, I'm wakeboarding every week and I'm buying my dib and never touching my savings. Want a date to Disney World? Yeah sorry I'm a broke college student and that place is not worth my money. If she can't understand that then I'm not gonna date her.

"That would be awesome! Assuming she's feminine enough to pique my interest, I would fuck me. "
"As someone that's done both my fair share of applying and hiring, here's my take on it.

The positions you're likely going to applying for and that don't require related experience are going to be junior / entry level, or advertised as a graduate role.  When searching for jobs, try adding ""graduate"" or ""junior"" to the search to wheedle out the ones with no necessary prior experience.

Reference-wise, you're at a bit of a disadvantage as you can't use a current or former employer.  It may behoove you to find some basic shit-kicker work (e.g. hospitality) as a.) being currently employed makes you more attractive; and b.) you gain employment references.

Failing that, you can use:

- A lecturer / student supervisor that you've had.

- A coordinator or something if you've done any volunteer work, or belong to a sporting club or something.

- Someone in a professional position that knows you personally and is willing to vouch for you.

**Notes on references**

- Need to have: Full name, title, organisation, current phone number, current email.

- No family members.  Your mum might think you're awesome but I don't want to hear it from her.

- Where possible, provide professional contacts, e.g. not just a mobile number and an @gmail or @hotmail address.

I've also jotted down some more general tips below, which are suitable if you're new to the workforce, or just applying for another job.

**Application and Resume.**

- First and foremost, do what job ads want. If it asks for a resume and cover letter, don't send one or the other. If it asks for Word, don't send PDFs. It's a simple and well used screening mechanism, but it works.

- Resume - if I can't tell in the first thirty seconds that you meet most of the minimum criteria and can type a sentence without making basic spelling and grammatical errors, it goes in the bin.  Have someone capable review it for you, and be responsive to feedback.

*Note:  happy to do this for you if you want to PM me.*

- Resume - should be two pages single-sided, or one page back-and-front.

- Resume - don't say that you ""provided excellent customer service to a variety of key stakeholders in the hospitality industry, whilst concurrently ensuring that high standards of quality and safety were adhered to at all times"" for a job at McDonald's.

- Don't put fluff in a resume that can be put into a cover letter.  Generally, your cover letter is the who and why, and your resume is the what, when, where and how.

- Social networking. If there's publicly available photos of you doing drugs, badmouthing your previous employers, or saying blatantly racist / sexist / offensive stuff, don't even bother applying to any large company.  *I'm fucking amazed how many people forget this one.*

**Interview Preparation.**

- Shit / shave / shower / haircut before the interview.

- Interview dress - find out what employees of the company wear to work and emulate it. It's an old tactic, but it avoids being under or overdressed, and helps the interviewer(s) see you as a potential employee rather than an applicant.

- Ideally, bring something with you to demonstrate your skills rather than just talk about them. I'd encourage everyone to have a portfolio of some sort, and if you've had no work experience bring in an example of a report or something you did for school / college. Always good to have a prop.

- Interview terminology - do not refer to your interviewer(s) as ""bro"" or ""dude"" unless you're interviewing at Google or a bong shop. If you say something like that, I will say ""it's been a pleasure meeting you, someone will be in touch"" (and at most you'll get a batch email saying we appreciate your interest, though we didn't, and that you were a good candidate, even though you weren't).

Typically, most interviews these days are on a first-name basis, unless the organisation is *ultra* conservative, you're not going to be expected to call them ""sir"" or ""Mr"".  That being said, play it by ear.  If your interviewer introduces himself as ""Mr. Richards"", call him that - better to err on the side of formality, and 90% of the time they'll just say ""call me Steve"".

**Responding to Interview Questions.**

- *Why do you want to work for [company]?*

Have a good reason. Interest in the industry and a specific project we're involved with is good. Wanting to further your career and pursue opportunities is good. Silence or ""because I need a job"" are bad. Have a google beforehand and see what they're doing now.

- *Tell me about a time that you worked as part of a team to overcome a problem.*

Short, 1-2 minute answer about something work related.  If you don't have a work-related one, use an example from college e.g. ""we had a major project due and one of our group had to quit out due to personal problems, which we solved by re-allocating the work...""

Important: do not say anything negative about your previous employer or colleagues, or people you went to school with.

- *Give me an example of how you've dealt with difficult people.*

Same rule as before, the best example being a difficult client or customer that you went out of your way to help. Alternately, maybe a difficult lecturer or examiner that you couldn't see eye-to-eye with but was able to get a good result with.

That way, you're not badmouthing someone at your old job, and every job has some asshole they need to keep happy as part of their role, so everyone can identify with it.

- *Tell me how you've applied workplace safety to your personal life.*

I hate this fucking question - who cares? If you're at work or on a rig it's my problem and my business, but if you get home, get drunk at and drive a monster truck over a minefield, that's your business.

My best advice if you're asked that is to make up some bullshit about making sure you keep a first aid kit at home and in the car.

- *Where do you see yourself in five years?*

Don't be funny, don't be cute, just say something like that you'd like to be transitioning towards a more senior role with more responsibilities at the company, in line with both yours and the company's development goals.

For a graduate, you can be pretty honest - ""I want to develop my work experience and professional skills to support my further goals of having a career in the [field] industry."""

She, for all intent and purposes, is way out of my league in almost every aspect. But **she makes me better**.  She makes me work harder, challenges me, gives me a direction when I'm lost in life, and acts as a moral compass.  This girl, I do not deserve,  but for some reason she refuses to leave and it seems like she helps me mature and grow.  I want to be the man that deserves to be with a girl like her, and slowly, but surely, she helps me turn into Him.  It's working out good, but we're both young.  We'll see"
"$100 or less?

Probably new bed sheets. My old bedroom, the only possible arrangement I could do would have the head of my bed directly against the only window in the room. The windows are ancient, the building is at least 90 years old. The insulation is nonexistent. In the winter time, my head would freeze so I'd bundle up on blankets. Then the rest of me would overheat. I'd wake up drenched in sweat.

Got a new room finally, so I bought new bedsheets just because the old ones were gross despite washing them. New ones were half the price, lower thread count I think, and twice as comfortable somehow...
