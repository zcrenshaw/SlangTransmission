"Woman here. Have never lost interest because a guy needed a minute to put a condom on. What you're describing sounds a lot like foreplay - fool around a bit, get hard, put on a condom, play a little bit more if you need to and then go for it. Seriously, we aren't judging, I imagine having a dick can be a bit complicated."
"Because I hate being continually faced with the feelings that haunt me every time I see her. The feelings that the person I thought I could finally connect with doesn't like me like that, and while I accept her decision, it still hurts like a son of a bitch."

"Sanitation workers. Actually went on a date with a girl a couple of months back who said that they get paid too much money for ""such an easy job"". Made me lose respect for her right away since these guys are working shitty hours, in the cold, in the heat, in snow, rain, etc and they're breaking their backs. It's a very tough job. "
How dare you 
"Walk up and shake his hand. Introduce yourself. 

In my experience, the ""what are your intentions"" talks rarely happen. Just be friendly and polite when you meet the family. Ask about their interests, they'll ask about yours.

"One of the problems is the loneliness, many of your old friends are rolling in different(read: married and committed) circles or tending to their families. So I have been trying to include myself in a new group of single folks. But so far no luck. 

Another is that a 30 something single guy, is always thought has some issue either psychological or emotional."

Sundress.
"She was very conservative and always dressed nicely, so the first time I saw her in pajama pants and a tank top it just drove me wild for some reason.  

Edit- I just remembered she also usually wore contacts and was wearing her glasses and I think glasses are sexy and it just added to an already incredibly sexy situation. "
"&gt;it's like all the late night group conversations and open discussions and trust meant nothing at all compared to not being romantic partners. 

Alternatively, it meant that being rejected by someone that one felt such a connection with hurts a whole hell of a lot more than being rejected by someone who is just a stranger with a pretty face and a nice ass at a bar or club."
"It's attractive to people who also want to travel and it's ""exotic"" to people who feel ""stuck"" where they are, or perhaps haven't traveled much.

There's a lot of world out there. Some people are happy staying in their home town, some people want to go out and explore it."
"Yeah this is a huge problem. Right around 27-30 all my social circle started pairing off and started doing their own thing. It was a common pattern, it was usually like:

1. Friend starts dating someone pretty hard
2. Friend falls off radar

At this point, one of two things happens:

* Friend re-emerges engaged and asks you to join his becoming a formal couple thing. After the wedding, you become a background friend. I completely get this and I am totally fine with it
* Friend breaks up and re-integrates back into social circle until the next relationship starts

So like, one day when you are 30-35 you want to go hang out with your friends and you realize that they are all married and can't really come out and drink or go see a movie without 4 days notice and you just kind of find yourself on an island.

This is where the catch-22 comes into play. You start to adapt and you get really, really good at doing things by yourself without anyone. You start going to movies by yourself, you start finding hobbies you do by yourself to keep you occupied, you start focusing on your work more... It seems harmless while in the process, but in reality you drive yourself towards greater social isolation. 

So all that aside /u/Khue, what is the advantage to being at your stage in the game? Dude, I am a totally different person now at 30+ than I was at 27-30. I am super financially stable. I can basically pick up at the drop of a hat and go live/work where ever I want. I can take a two week vacation from work and go travel the world. The freedom I have now is insane. The caveat? I want to do all this stuff with someone. Preferably for the rest of my life... How do?"

Love life may be a rather grandiose term for staring at women on the bus. 
"You can't play the ""doesn't friendship mean anything to you card,"" and not recognize his feelings, too. You think you feel like crap? Imagine what he's going through. The things you think didn't mean anything probably meant the world to him. That's why he developed feelings beyond friendship.

Honestly, you're being selfish. Let the guy have his space if that's what he wants. Maybe he'll get over it and you can be friends again, or maybe he won't. That's the way life goes. Right now all I'm seeing is you don't want to feel like crap, but you would have no problem making him feel like it instead."

"When I was in college I was standing in line to get a chicken biscuit. I had my headphones in and was jamming out with my ipod. This cute girl in front of me kept stealing glances at me and making eye contact. I was like ""shittt, obviously this girl wants a slice of my sex cake!""  She look back at me again and turned around and smiled (this had never happened to me). I was so impressed with myself. So I pulled off my head phones and gave her the coolest smile and ""hey what's going on"". 


She says ""your phone has been ringing for awhile.""

* Indicates a sense of adventure and passion. "

"Go down on her while she is messing with the condom.

Let her put it on you.

Watch her play with herself while you are putting it on.

Ask her for some ideas

Point is, a condom is a sexual aid, if you don't make a big deal and rush, then it isn't. Look for creative ways to put it on and have fun with it. Sex is fun.

"It was our fourth date, and we were at  her place after dinner. She was wearing a tight sweater, a skirt, and stockings. We started fooling around, and she took off her clothes, revealing that she wasn't just wearing stockings, she was wearing a full body stocking thing. That was hot. She kept it on the whole time we had sex.    "
"I used to be with a woman with a pretty high libido. Sometimes I didn't feel like it. It happened and it had nothing to do with my attraction for her or my love for her. 

But she would NOT take it well. After a while, I ended up having sex with her even when I didn't really want to because it was easier than dealing with the shitstorm that would follow a rejection...

"Well, you rejected him, and this sounds like someone who you had a good connection with. 

Think about how much that sucks for him. You're not just some chick at a bar he met 5 minutes ago. Even though you have this good connection that isn't enough for you to consider being in a relationship with him... That fucking hurts dude.

Being around you and interacting with you is a constant reminder to him that he isn't good enough to date you."
"Your friend probably likes you a lot more than you think he does. I've had to do the same thing. There's a difference between getting rejected by someone at a bar and being ""ah well that's life"" and getting rejected by someone who you truly cared for.

You know how in some movies, when someone witnesses something really bad happen, there is this high pitched ringing noise that slowly drowns out the voices? Yeah, that happens in real life. It has happened to me. Twice. Once when I found out my dad died, and another while my best friend was rejecting me.

I don't claim to know him, but if it is anything like the situation I was in when I asked my best friend of 3 years and got shot down, it's like saying ""oh yeah you're a good friend and all, I like your personality and you're funny and you're cool to hang out with, but oh god you're just way too ugly for me to date. Sorry :)!"" That shit sucks to hear.

You rejected being in a romantic relationship, so now he is rejecting being in a platonic relationship. Just let him go."

High status job people tend to have a big effect by themselves. A professional football coach, high powered attorney, doctor, or lead engineer will do work that directly impacts thousands to millions of people's lives."

"Well I'm a chemical engineer but we need more process technicians and operators. With only a HS degree it is pretty easy to start at around 70k and you can pretty easily get north of 100k. I know plenty of operators who make more than the engineers, much more once you factor in OT. You get benefits and PTO as well.

If you can pass a drug test and a fairly easy competence exam, you're good to go.

**Edit1:** I'm glad this is drumming up a lot of interest. As soon as I get home later I'll make another edit including what the job generally entails, what kinds of companies/locations you should be looking at, etc 

**Edit2:** Ok, I think I addressed the people who approached me via message or whatever about what it is they do, how to get there, etc. but I'll post the general information here.

In a chemical plant, you have the engineers, and you have the operators. My post specifically talks about the operators. They are the guys on the front lines. Chemical manufacturing plants are basically massive networks of pipes, pumps, heaters, coolers, and they usually revolve around super fat pieces of environment-controlled pipe otherwise known as chemical reactors. Operators are the guys out in the field making sure all that shit works the way it should. They are the ones out in the field turning pumps on and off, getting pressure and temperature readings of critical equipment and logging it, hooking up steam and water hoses where they need to be in order to clean equipment, they open and close valves to direct the process fluids to where they need to be, etc.

A lot of people think the engineers do all this. 90% of the time, they aren't. The operators are doing all this. The engineers create the procedures for how to get product from point A to point B, the operators are the ones who actually do it. Additionally, operators are the guys in the control room staring at multiple computer monitors that basically graphically depict the entire chemical plant. It shows process parameters such as pressure, temperature, flowrate, etc. and alarms whenever something gets out of whack. The operators run the show from in here 80% of the time. They become experts on the process.

It pays a lot beacuse (going back to the original point of the post), there aren't all that many people doing it and they are critical as fuck. A good operator is worth his weight in gold plus some. Also, if they fuck up, it costs a lot of money, so there really isn't much leeway to fuck up. If you are caught goofing off, you're done. If you show up to work late twice, you're done. If you damage equipment because you weren't following procedure, you're done. Also, it's relatively dangerous. You're 1/4"" of steel away from 10,000 gallons of boiling hot organic chemical, and you're opening and closing valves. God forbid maintenance fucked up and put the wrong gasket on that flange, and you're looking at a severe chemical burn at a minimum. It's very, very rare. But shit like that happens. People die every year in this industry due to the nature of the work. So, there is definitely some risk factor built into the compensation.

You know what though? Safety is, at every single place I've ever worked at, sincerely the most important part of the job. Each company I've worked at truly does take it incredibly seriously. It makes sense. Even if you're a cynical bastard, you need to understand that a workplace death costs a chemical company, on average, $7million. That's a fuck ton of money and can make or break a weak business unit. It is worth it to spend the extra time and money to keep you standing upright. 

Anywho... if you can pass a drug test and do well on a standardized test, that's half the battle. After that, if you have any history of manual labor, that's a nice bonus. A degree is a bonus, but not required. The majority of guys I've worked with don't have them so don't sweat it if you don't. The main thing is you are probably going to have to be willing to move since these jobs aren't exactly geography friendly. Specifically, if you are willing to move to the Gulf Coast or the Great Lakes area (sorry, not Chicago for the most part), you're going to have a far easier time. If you're willing to go so far as to work in the middle of buttfuck nowhere Alabama, I'd find it very hard to believe you couldn't find employment as an operator.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask. If even one person can improve their life from this info, I'll consider it a good way to cap the tumultuous year of 2016. 

**TL;DR:** If you're willing to move, are clean of drugs, are willing to move to possibly undesirable locations, and don't mind manual work in a chemical plant, you can go forth and stack that skrilla"

"When my oldest daughter was in 7th grade she wanted to go in a date for the first time, to a school dance. We told her that we had to meet the guy and his parents before it was allowed, because we wanted to know a little about him. 

We met his parents at a school concert shortly after. One requirement down. We met the guy himself a few days later. I was out of town for work. When got home that afternoon, he had come over to meet us and found our daughter mowing the yard (she got paid for it), and being a gentleman he offered to finish it for her. So, I came home and found him mowing my lawn. Not a bad first impression. 

The best thing you can do for yourself and your relationship is never forget that that girl is a member of a family. Daughter, sister, granddaughter, niece, the list goes on. She isn't an object or a conquest. She's a person and a valued part of her family. When you look at her you should also see the people that mean so much to her. As a father, I can tell when a guy is keeping that in his mind, or if he's just out for a good time. The latter will not win you any favors from either parent. "

As we're hiking, I point out birds and wildlife we see. Invariably we see some ravens.

""Did you know there's actually an easy way to tell the difference between a raven and a crow?"" I ask my friend.

""No, what is it?""

""Well, when the birds are flying above you, you can look up and see the feathers on the wing that are really distinctive and stick out, right? Those are called pinyon feathers.""

""Sure, I remember learning about those.""

""Well you can count how many pinyon feathers the bird has on each wing. A raven has eight pinyon feathers, while a crow only has seven.""

""Oh wow, that's pretty usefu-""

""So you see, it's really only a matter of a pinyon.""

It's right around this time when my friend forcibly inserts my hiking pole into my rectum, making the hike back to the car VERY uncomfortable.

Was I nervous? Yes, a little bit. But if you are polite, respectful, and not trying too hard to impress him, and stay relaxed, you will create a basic good first impression. Making small talk with her family can also break the ice even further, and make them feel more comfortable around you. They should be able to feel good about the guy their daughter is dating.

Addendum: As a guy with a younger sister, I can say that a similar introduction can also work if she has an older brother. If he is like me, he would look at the boyfriend more closely to make sure he won't mess with his little sister, and that he would treat her with the respect she deserves."
"Usually because in most guy girl relationships, friend or otherwise, the guy is the one reaching out. Once you get shot down, it gets kinda awkward reaching out, and thus neither party talks to one another, and the friendship turns to dust.

EDIT: feels like I should write more so I will: Most intorverted guys (save for a few really attractive ones) don't have a lot of options. This lack of options is likely what causes them to fall hard and fast, as they see you as their one shot. Once that shot is gone, they don't want to spend time around you because it might feel like you are a living reflection of them not being good enough, never being good enough for love. hope this helps"

Men are expected to be the deciders and come up with ideas.  The whole ""do you want to get dinner?"" thing comes to mind, but I see this all the time in other aspects.  

We're expected to pay for more things and in somes cases all of the things.  "
"1. Men need to be the stoic ones, while women have full liscense to express their emotions in any way they see fit. This might be simple normal things like crying when something sad happens, or damaging like yelling at a partner for making resonable mistakes. This is often a consquence of

2. Women need to carry the emotional weight in the relationship while men need to show up to dinner/date nights. Women are expected to be excellent communicators, while men who give the silent treatment are being men.

3. Women bargain with men, to allow them to have sex. I've never seen this happen in real life or in my relationships. However, there seems to be this idea that men need to ""win"" sex from their wives with things like chores, etc. When really, women usually want to bang their partners. This idea is probably what causes

4. The notion that if men do not feel like having sex at a given time with their partner, that something is very very wrong. Not that they had sex earlier in the day, he's tired, he feels ill, or he just isn't feeling it. If he doesn't want to have sex, the world must be coming to an end.

Honestly, everyone loses when we use traditional gender roles as a substitute for real life communication."

Also, allow yourself to get harder before you do it. If you're fully erect I find it actually feels good to put the condom on and makes it easier too. After a while you will associate the act with the satisfaction that comes after and will be thrilled to roll one on over time.

Any woman who complains you're taking too long is kinda shitty anyway. Having said that I've never heard a girl complain (about the condom, not the horrible, nightmarish sex she will never be able to forget).

"Okay. Imagine you are hungry. One day, you happen by a bakery. You smell bread being baked and every day you want that bread more and more. You talk to the baker and you realize he's a nice guy. Every day, you talk to the baker your hunger grows. The smell of the bread begins driving you nuts. You know it is delicious. 

But, you can't afford the bread. You hope the baker will offer you some, but he doesn't. Holy fuck, you're so very hungry and that bread smells amazing. You feel like you will die if you don't get that bread. Every day you become a little more desperate, and you like yourself a little less. Sure, the baker is a nice guy, and it's nice talking to him, but you're hungry.

Eventually, one day you work up the courage to ask for some bread - almost driven to madness by the hunger. You do ask, but it comes off awkward as shit. The baker understands, but he has to make a living. He can't give the bread away.

Now, as much as you might like that baker, going back is going to be awkward. 

1 - You're still hungry. You need to eat.

2 - just visiting will make the baker suspicious that you just want bread.

3 - you're embarrassed about not having money. Seeing the baker is a reminder of that inadequacy.

4 - you made a fool of yourself by asking. That awkward moment lives in that bakery always ready to greet you.

No matter how much you like the baker, going to his shop is just going to make things harder until you eat."
"&gt;Being around you and interacting with you is a constant reminder to him that he isn't good enough to date you.

Nailed it right here. People, especially guys, assign a lot of self-worth to being able to date people, and that self-worth isn't fulfilled by other things. If you tell him that you still like him because he's funny, smart, etc., it highlights the fact that he still wasn't ""good enough to date you,"" and that can really sting coming from someone you've grown close with over several years."

"It's emphasized in social media and online dating in the hopes of sticking out from the bland mass of other people with nothing interesting about themselves.

It's impossible to make a blanket statement as to its attractiveness. Different people like different things.

Personally, it doesn't impress me much. I've travelled much myself, and as a result I'm not easily dazzled. In fact, people who can't shut up about their travels strike me as either tedious (vacation slides syndrome for those of us old enough to have suffered through that), as restless and attention-span deprived or desperate to have *some* interesting quality. I attach much more weight to the motive for travelling, than to how well-travelled someone is."
"Um.  Well some family members (not all) bug me about kids and ""when yall gettin married?""

Some friends have dropped off the map.  But I've since met new friends too.  So I don't really feel alone that way.  Occasionally I get to visit a long time friend and catch up.  Other long time friends have remained ever present in our social circle even with their kids.  Some folks become home bodies and some don't.

I loved doing the blue collar jobs though, just so much more interesting day to day work. It was nice getting a solid workout every day without hitting the gym and an actual sense of accomplishment. I didn't like the unsteady work flow and at times the hours were completely random.

"For everyone here 20-25 despairing about how its going, I will say that when I turned 26 just over a year ago, it's like a switch flipped and suddenly I got a ton more attention than before. I think it's because women, especially older ones, see that you are in the back half of your 20s and if you have your shit together you start to look like boyfriend or marriage material. By this age a lot more women also get over it and message first if they are interested."

"Wish I could. That was during my ""somewhat oblivious"" phase... Somehow I missed all the signals she sent me for over a year. Like inviting me down to the bottom of the library for no reason (right after inviting me to go swimming with her and then coming out like that) and then idly commenting that she's heard ""people have sex in these rooms sometimes."" Maybe I was too distracted by her hotness to realize that *she* might be trying to make a move on *me.* She eventually lost interest I guess.

"Very different. Above all:

- The heat. I hadn't imagined it to feel so much warmer than, say, the skin on her arm or her belly.

- The softness. While ""silky soft"" is probably one of the better analogies, it really doesn't do it justice. ""Vagina"" should be the top value on the international softness scale.

- The little contractions. Whenever I am inside her, her vagina gives these erratic, tiny little clenches, without rhyme or rhythm to them. The first time I experienced that, it was a ""whoa! it's alive!"" moment."
"My wife and I are 36. What I have found is that 

1) my attraction is not just to her physically, but there's a bond there that has been forged over 12 years of experiences, hardships, victories, etc. Yes we both try our best to keep our bodies fit, but you're right that some physical changes are unavoidable. But because I love HER more than just her body, those features are now part of what I am attracted to.

2) Because I tend to spend time with people in my age bracket, college-age girls look like children to me now. So there is actually far less physical attraction there than when I was in that bracket. A woman on my age bracket who takes care of herself is far more attractive to me because we are more likely to have similar interests, experiences, maturity levels, etc. 

3) Basically it becomes far less about looks and far more about overall relationship potential. The wives of some men who have had affairs are often surprised when they see that the mistress is actually physically less attractive than her. In these cases the mistress was typically giving the husband something emotionally that the wife wasn't. "

Telling me you are **entirely** reliant on a person's intellect to define your sexual attraction is over the top to me though.  Chris Evans and Chris Farley are just as equally a blank slate until you know how smart they are?  Not buying it.

I'll accept that you can find a person more attractive based on their personality, passions, and charisma (Chris Farley for example).  You can lose attraction to a person because they are cruel, brainless, or dull.

But saying that physical attributes have no influence on your sexual attraction (muscular/fat, man/woman, grey and wrinkled/young and toned, etc.) until you know how smart somebody is just doesn't make sense to me."

Because  of our mutual friend, we both had some idea that we were interested in each other.

I set something up one weekend to go ice skating or something like that with a small group.  The girl I was interested in cancelled, so I set something up for the following weekend, and a day beforehand she cancels again.  A couple of weeks later I try to set something up a 3rd time but it goes nowhere and eventually I just give up trying.

"Female here, but please don't be too down on yourself. Society has this thing where guys are down for sex 100% of the time, all day every day. And that's just not true, and that idea is harmful to both men and women, who end up with hurt feelings when the guy is just not feeling it. I've tried to initiate with my husband several times over the past ten years where he was just not feeling up to it. Sometimes I initiated when he was playing a video game or watching a movie he was really into and at that moment, sex was just not on his mind. Or he would not be feeling good or was tired and just couldn't get in the mood. It hurt my feelings at first because I bought into the narrative that guys were pretty much always down for sex, and I thought well if he's turning me down, I must not be attractive enough. But eventually I realized that that thinking is flawed, and he is just as emotionally deep as I am, and if his mind isn't into sex, that's not my fault. So please don't feel too hard on yourself. He just had something on his mind, or was tired, or was more interested in whatever he was doing at the moment. It's not because you're not sexy to him, and it's nothing you should be down on yourself about or beat him up about."

I don't go out on the weekends. I don't go to the store. I either order in or have groceries delivered. My friends ask to go out, I tell them I'm too tired. Which I am mind you.

"A friend of mine is in his 30s, he spent 8 years in law school, he figured out if he registered for a full course load, applied for assistance, then dropped courses during the drop/pass window he got to keep the money. So he took 1 course at a time until he finished lawschool, but getting financial aid as if he was taking a full course load to pay for his lifestyle.

Now he's ""studying"" for the bar, which means he sleeps all day, reads notes for the couple of hours between when his parents get home from work and when they go to bed, and then plays video games all night.

His actions have alienated all of his friends. It's not that he doesn't have a job, it's the way he's spending his time. He uses ""I'm studying"" as an excuse for everything, but he could also study during the day when everyone else is at work. He tells people he's too busy studying to find a job, but he's been given 2 different jobs by 2 different people basically sitting at a reception desk where he would be allowed to study, because it makes him look busy. He quit both without notice.  

But the real kicker is he has no job, no girlfriend, and no bills, but he's far too busy to do anything that doesn't sound fun or requires him to wake up before 10am. Too busy to help people move, too early to wake up to go fishing or hunting.

This right here is the main point I think. OP, I get that you got hurt from this too, but put yourself in the guys shoes for a second, he knew that he would risk everything you guys had if he asked you out, but he had that strong of feelings for you to do so. I can't say that this is always the case, but if a guy gets close enough to a girl, sometimes he just can't bear the fact that he's not even more intimate with you. Now this does not mean that you have to reciprocate, but I am sure that while he is most likely upset, he is content that he at least tried to become closer with you and failed, rather than stay on the sidelines.

"Best and worst here:

One day in my later 20's I was on a long road trip in a quiet car and had plenty of time to think about life, etc. 

For whatever reason my mind started wandering through past relationships and the insights of my marriage caused me to suddenly realize how many women/girls in my life (including HS) were trying to let me know they were interested in me while naive/stupid me never asked them out.

Best: I finally understood women enough to read their ""Ask me out already!"" signals.

Worst: Right in front of my wife who saw my face drop in shock and asked ""What's wrong?"" I was too shocked to realize that I shoudn't answer honestly. The rest of our road trip was spent in silence allright... hostile silence.

Still Best: We divorced years later and the insights came in handy.

Suck them and hear them moaning while I estimulate myself ALWAYS worked for me.

Waiting staff, hotel workers, and retail workers are too often treated like crap and are underpaid.  Teachers are seriously underpaid and too many people see them as unskilled, spoiled unionists.  Plumbers are very important but aren't generally respected.  And then, there are white-collar workers.  I hate it when they're resented and seen as spoiled, lazy elitists just because they work with their minds instead of their hands.  It's still work, and just because they shower before work instead of after it doesn't mean they aren't productive."

"Two general points:

1) Men have feelings too. He is either faced with trying to stoically ignore the stomach clenching pain to give you what you want to get an imperfect version of what he wants - something which could draw out the pain over a longer period and even exacerbate it if you get together with another guy OR he goes for a clean break which is less pleasant for a while but generally faster to move on from. Either way, this situation has cost him a lot and is still costing him a lot. You might have just lost a friend, he has lost a friend AND suffered a broken heart.

2) Men don't have the support network that a lot of women do. This isn't something you can discuss with mum or sister (in the main) and most guy friends are better at cheering up by diversion, not by emotional resolution. Ironically the person best suited to helping him through this might have been you but he's lost that as well due to the feelings of hurt and rejection he feels when he sees you.

Now, it isn't your fault. He is the one who developed feelings and acted on them but ultimately you can't expect someone to flog themselves just to be a friend. Life is too short to punish yourself like that. Maybe he comes around, maybe he doesn't. It isn't up to you. Don't beat yourself up about it. If you care about him then let him heal, pursue a girl that will make him happy and maybe, just maybe realise that you are someone he wants to keep in his life.

Good luck."

"I took an evening course for hair styling - Nothing in-depth. I was the only bloke there and nobody spoke to me for the first 4 classes (Of 6). I'd get these weird looks when we were supposed to pair-off and work together - I don't have long hair that someone else could practice on and the women with long hair clearly took evasive action and I landed a practice doll head thing. It kind of tickled me what they must have been imagining of me. Eventually, after the 4th class ended the woman teaching the class cornered me as everyone left and asked what I hoped to achieve there. I explained that I was bringing up a 4 year old daughter at the time and that I'd grown up in a family of boys, I had no idea what to do with long hair and needed to learn quick so she didn't look like she'd been dragged through a hedge.

The problem is nobody wants to pay us a decent living despite the grueling work we do, as well as the issue of widespread gentrification; wealthy people/land developers don't consider the fact that businesses that make an area nice are often worked by people who don't make a lot of money. The meal you order is worth more than what the people making it and serving it make in wages. These folks get pushed farther and farther away from their jobs, which really sucks when you already have no free time whatsoever, so any added commute time is just brutal.

"*Some women* *

And I feel like the answer is self explanatory here: self confidence issues. They worry that they don't look at good as women in porn and that the man is therefore preferring porn women but ""settling"" for her. Some think that if they outlaw porn then their man will find them more attractive. Some have very stringent views on sexuality and think that even thinking of other women sexually is the first step to cheating (this is again usually due to insecurity.

If I could try to make a comparison: how would you feel if your girlfriend was liking the photos of some male model on instagram all the time and leaving comments telling him how hot he was? While it's not a linear comparison, you may think ""That's crossing a line, complimenting him, it shows an emotional connection"" but a lot of women think ""That's crossing a line, ejaculating to her, that shows a sexual connection."" I'm not saying either are logical conclusions, FYI. "

"I think you have it backwards. The reason he can't face you is because he *can't* throw away all those wonderful moments with you.


As men in society, we are expected to behave certain ways. We are criticized and critiqued literally from *childhood* until *death* about not revealing feelings, not being ""soft"", and not being vulnerable. This is reinforced whenever we do open up like this, people (particularly women) see us differently, and not usually in the positive way. Its just the way of things.

So, when we finally do find one person that we can open up to, can feel safe being vulnerable and connect with emotionally, and reveal all our heart's emotions and feelings, we are ecstatic. We crave it. We are addicted to it. We *love* that person. We never want them to go. We want them to be around forever. We want them in almost every aspect of our life (obviously not realistic, but the emotional pull is that intense).


So on order to accomplish this goal of having this person be in our lives, and to seek confirmation that *we* mean as much to you as *you* mean to us, we have to take the big leap; we have to hang ourselves out there, despite a lifetime of conditioning warning against it, and face ultimate judgement as to whether or not we are as special to you as you are to us.


Now, there are only two answers to that question; we either *are* or we *are not*. Your answer was *are not*, which is a devastating blow to anyone. One of the more painful feelings anyone can experience. An emotional blow that requires time to heal, and talking out to resolve.


Except the only person we can talk about it to is the same one who dealt the damage. Because we cant go down to the bar crying our eyes out weeping about how much it hurts. We cant gather our guy friends together for emotional support about a *rejection*. Because therapy is expensive and will generally be seen as ""overkill"".


We are alone again. Isolated, in pain, and unable to do anything about it or tell anyone about it without even more negative societal judgements. ""Who cares? Man up"" ""Dont be a pussy"" ""Stop crying like a bitch"".


So to sum it up, we cut all ties and try to start moving on, because of the few options available, it is the least painful for the shortest amount of time (aside from suicide, but thats an ultimate commitment.)


Note: I do not endorse suicide in any way as a viable option or answer to rejection or other problems and/or issues in relationships."

Exactly! I completely relate to this. I also think that getting that person out of your life even if it's temporarily is important for your own mental health. Pretending to not have feelings for a person is mentally stressful and it's not good for the other party as well cause all you're doing by keeping up a platonic relationship is lying to them. How can you possibly say you're completely happy if that person ever has a relationship. That would be a straight up lie. You need that break as difficult as it is to get over that person otherwise that relationship is a lie.

"Like an actual cold approach, ""this woman is now hitting on me through no action of my own"" - maybe 5 times in my life. 

But that's not how women usually roll. 99% of the time they're opening the door hoping you walk through it, not walking through it themselves. Whereas men approach women by going up to them and hoping to shit they don't get rejected, women usually try to make it easier for *you* to talk to *them.* If you're in a bar and you say something to your friend and the lady at the next table laughs and then you notice her and start chatting, you'll probably feel like a champ for hitting on her. But really she orchestrated the whole thing through crafty she-devil witchcraft and you fell right into the trap. "

Usually if you are interested in someone its because you feel they are the best option for you. Being around them feels like you are going to have settle and that is a hard feeling to cope with. Being around them makes you feel unworthy and trying to your self confidence. It's really personal. If your are a good friend why wouldn't you make a good romantic partner? Its hard to reconcile, especially since you don't really know the reasoning. 

I am rambling at this point but that's just some of the reasoning. I don't have a feeling either way, I wouldn't judge someone either way. Its a personal decision. "

I'm starting to notice drifting away somewhat from my friends who are having kids, working longer hours and filling their lives with more commitments.

"I'll answer for myself, I think this is similar to what other female friends of mine feel too. Obviously a generalisation but I think girls, due to being more open about our emotions in general, have an advantage in some settings. In being more open and talking about our feelings more, we get better at digesting them and being accepting of them. This, I think, makes it easier sometimes for us to go ""oh shit, I notice that I have feelings for my friend"" before they consume us. And, if those feelings aren't reciprocal, ""ok, I need to get over this and I will"" or ""I'm comfortable knowing that he doesn't feel the same, and I can accept the disparity"". Whereas my male friends don't always realise how much they like someone until they really really have strong feelings. And then they don't have so many avenues to vent or analyse or process those feelings.

Edit: good responses have pointed out that it's not guys ""not realizing"", it's just a different way of noticing or acknowledging."

It was arguably the best day of my life. I would buy her dinner anytime

Edit: So for everyone asking what I was waiting for, she was in a relationship, and still is. That being said, if the relationship ever ends (which there appears to be trouble in paradise recently) I'll damn sure be there. I'm a firefighter and an EMT, and we work together frequently."
"This is making me angry. Why do women think that playing hard to get filters the non serious guys out? I'm willing to bet it does the exact opposite.

"Pro tip: don't grind with a girl if she hasn't so much as even seen your face. That's fucking weird, personally, and I found it really uncomfortable having a bunch of random dudes just start touching me when I would be dancing. It's possible that she's purposely backing up dat ass into you, but it's also possible the crowd is just moving her that direction.

Of course every woman is different. But if you guys haven't even made eye contact before then I think it's a stretch to assume she's seen you, that she's attracted to you, and that she wants you to touch her butt. 

You could try moving up and to the side a bit so that she sees you. You could try kind of brushing her shoulder or something so she turns around and you can make eye contact and smile and see if she's receptive. You could go the ""tap the shoulder"" route and just say ""Hey wanna dance?"" Because it's its mid song and she's into it she might agree. Honestly most of my bar going days were spent thinking ""Ugh who is touching me?"" and trying to move away from the random hand they decided to caress my waist, blech; what I wouldn't have given to just have a guy acknowledge I had a face as opposed to touching all up on me without so much as an introduction."

"Having sex with a condom is good, but finishing in a girl without one turns your fucking world inside out. Once teenage me figured this out he accidentally impregnated his girlfriend, married her, raised a kid together for 4 years, got cheated on, stayed together for another 3, got cheated on again, said fuck it and left. 

Still see my daughter on the weekends and life is fine now, but it feels like I spent my adult life in a fugue state that I didn't come out of until 25."
"I'll try to explain my perspective in the best terms I can. Keep in mind I am a virgin with no relationship experience so take what I say with a grain of salt.

Men are the choices, women are the choosers. In dating, a man comes up to a woman, proposes what he has to offer (i.e. looks, status, personality), and from there the woman gives him the Yay or Nay. Simplified sure, but that is the essence. It happens the other way around sure, but in this case usually it is multiple women pursuing the same man, primarily due to very good looks or his status going up due to other women wanting him. This happens far less often, so the first statement is generally more true.

But why does this make it where guys can't handle rejection from long time friends? Well, let me put it this way. The more you get to know someone, relationship-wise or not, the more you know about what they have to offer. If you get rejected in a nightclub, you can always hide behind the reasoning that you were only rejected for looks, and your personality or sense of humor or way of life would have attracted her if she gave you a chance. But let's say you're a single guy, and you're getting to know this girl for, say, 2 or 3 years. You meet her through a mutual friend, you go in with no romantic intentions but over time feelings develop. By that time, the girl knows nearly 100% about you. She knows where you live, she knows your friends, your personality, your sense of humor, your job...basically everything except for your deepest darkest secrets.

And then you ask her out. And she still rejects you.

What can you hide behind? You exposed everything about yourself and she wasn't interested. She knows everything about you, has made her assessment, and has given you the Nay. At this point you have to believe it is because of your looks, because she would not have been your friend if any of your other qualities were too undesirable. That's why it hurts so much...this person liked you so much as a friend, and you thought you were developing feelings for each other and thought maybe she felt the same way, but she didn't. You gave her your all, you showed her everything, she knew everything about you, and you got rejected. There's nothing left, so you have to move on. At that point you are feeling so hopelessly crushed that you cannot even maintain a friendship.

I guess the most important thing to realize is that if 2 people do not feel the same way about each other, then the relationship cannot work, romantic or platonic. That's just all it is. You cannot salvage every friendship, you cannot hang on to every male friend that you have rejected, because all you're doing is giving false hope, and they deserve better than that."
"Basically I think that she hates my guts and that she's doing it to spite me and draw out the anxieties that lay not-so-dormant within me.  She gets a sick pleasure out of the paranoid spiral I am sending myself into, and she's probably touching herself to how freaked out I'm getting."
