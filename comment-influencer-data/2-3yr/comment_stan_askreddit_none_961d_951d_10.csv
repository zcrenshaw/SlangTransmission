"Just think, it could have been some poor, elderly couple who were lost. They pass by you and the elderly woman says, ""Stan look! There's a man walking on the side of the road. Let's ask him."" 
He insists, ""No Carol! I know where I'm going."" But when they reach the end of the road he realizes, ""Damn! We just passed this before. Let me turn around."" 
At this point, they pass you a second time and the old lady insists, ""Stan! Please go back and ask him for help! If he's walking he leaves nearby!"" Stan agrees. They turn around to ask for help and then can't find you anywhere. "
