"See if you can quit smoking.

I just got a cancer diagnosis from smoking.

It probably isn't going to end well."
"So, umbrella potato deception? Also, did you ever tickle oak tree rutabaga?"
Yup.
Absolutely. I was told to just fake it but I couldn't help myself. 
"Once there was this guy. He was a pretty normal looking sort of guy, white, he was pretty tall let's say 6 foot 6 or so, really dopey and goofy lookin guy, 19, blonde hair but with eyes like you haven't seen before. His eyes radiated a sort of chaotic energy that whenever he looked upon someone, their faults and shortcomings came to immediate attention. They would feel uncomfortable around him. They started asking him things like ""what did I do wrong?"" ""Why am I like this?"" ""What are my options?"" And he would always tell them simply. With a straight face and his eyes beaming that crazy chaotic energy, you must simply continue on. "
i personally thought this was hilarious
What are you saying to me 
You should go talk to someone about de-extreming. 
"I met you once at an airport in Vancouver. You posed for pictures with my family and graciously waited for me as I ran and purchased a ""The Usual Suspects"" dvd and then signed it. You seemed a little sad that day and I asked if you were ok and you said,""There are wounds that even old doc time can't heal. Don't mind me, nothing that a little whiskey won't fix"". If you don't mind me asking, what were you referring to?  

^(To be clear, none of this happened.)"
"I was referring to my severe and crippling depression.

When I was young my parents beat me for showing interest in other men. Then years later when I was finally brave enough to come out and try and find love, I was taken advantage of a sexually assaulted by the first man I ever dated. Now I'm too ashamed of who I am. I kept all these feelings hidden inside and they grew into a huge consuming darkness. [I wear a mask](http://m.imgur.com/3IDtPDU?r) in public and hide my true emotions. But I know I'll never feel happy again. 

^(To be clear, none of this is true)"
"Trailer Park Boys, but warmer and with fewer teeth."
I think I watched a video of you and your brother online.
"So incredibly hard. I felt incredibly isolated. I still had horrible tinnitus at this point, which honestly was about to drive me crazy. Hearing nothing but buzzers, alarms, shrill high pitched whining. Omg, it was horrible. I later figured out what made my tinnitus worse, caffeine and stress being the two worst. But early on I was fighting a losing battle. My husband was awesome about trying to keep me included. I actually had a natural talent for reading lips, I was very lucky there. My audiologist said I was better at reading lips than most who have been deaf for decades. As long as people looked at me and spoke fairly clearly and enunciated, I was fine. Anyway, the first day, it was hard seeing my kids not know how to interact with me. Seeing them go to my husband with things they normally would come to me for help. Thank goodness for captioning on tv, but even while watching tv I felt left out. My husband and kids would talk about something on the show and I couldn't keep up. He would try to explain what they had found funny or whatnot, but I could tell that it was becoming a lot for my husband. So I tried not to always go ""what what did they say"". As a child I was a voracious reader. That had tapered off as the older and busier I was. That night I walked to my bookshelf that I had hundreds of books I had never read but always said ""I will soon"" and picked up my love of reading again. The 10 months I was totally deaf I read close to 250 books. It was something that I could enjoy before hearing loss and after."
"It was a slow process. I used to think that people used abortion as a form of birth control, but then I educated myself a little and found out how expensive and difficult it is, and I started feeling sorry for those women, because we're all women and they seemed like they were just like me. Mostly, I got really sick of old white guys trying to tell women like me what to do. It came with maturity, I think: I realized it's none of my damn business what people do with their lives and I'm not qualified to make any decisions for anyone else. "
Of course it's 'bama
"well it was more of an understood since elementary school that we ""liked"" each other. but he asked me out when we were like 17 or so and i said no. then we went to prom with other people and he texted me after and said he wished it had been me instead. and he asked me out several times after. each time i said no.. and he finally asked why i didnt want to go out with him since we knew there were feelings there. and i explained that i didnt want anyone to look at us weird or for our relationship to be taboo. he said he didnt care but i still said i only wanted to go out as friends. so we went to a movie and i literally had the best time of my life with him. so i said, fuck it. if i want to be happy with someone, he is that someone.  "
"Im in alabama, usa. there are no laws here concerning it."
Were you really beating off in that shower scene at the beginning of *American Beauty?*
"I'm not sure if the Ashley Madison hack was the cause or not, but here's a second hand story. 

When the information was leaked, some of my in-laws realized that my husband's uncle's name was on the list, with his correct city. We all wondered if it was really him, and if his wife knew, but didn't hear anything for about a year. 

Last month, I met him for the first time at our wedding, and he mentioned that he was getting a divorce. He didn't mention why. "
"Looks like the cancer won, OP stopped responding.  RIP OP."
I'm sober and I can't try to read this without laughing

Your doctor has a morbid sense of humor."
"In actuality, Goofy is a bovine creature. Hence his romantic relationship with Clarabell Cow. "
I think maybe you watch too much TV.
"Congrats (a couple of years late, by the sounds of things)! While I understand why some might be ""troubled"" by your relationship, since you are not actually related, I couldn't care less about the ""step"" thing. What I am most impressed with is the bravery it took to risk your good friendship and potential family ""issues"" to take a chance on the person who *really* makes you happy. 

Kudos and the best of luck to you two!"

"When I went to have it activated my husband and three children went with me. The audiologist said why don't you come back and we will turn it on and you can adjust for a minute. Keep in mind my kids were 4, 4, 13. She knew that once they could talk to me I would be inundated with ""mom, mom, mom"". So she turned it on and honestly what surprised me and what you don't notice having ""normal"" hearing is EVERYTHING has a sound. She shuffled papers around, her chair squeaking, the computer. Our brain does such a good job of blocking out unnecessary noises that we forget that. After adjusting the volume and sensitivity I walked out to get my kids and my husband had ensured that the first thing they said was ""I love you"" because that one of the thing that bothered me the most when originally losing my hearing. Is not hearing that ever again. The car ride home was....hard though lol. The car noise and my kids all yelling over each other. It was awesome though. A good hard.

Edit: just wanted to say when my kids ran up to me and said ""I love you"" I lost it, I was hysterically crying. My audiologist was crying, the staff. People walking by stopped. It was a very very special moment and I'll never forget the feeling. Don't take for granted the ability to have your loved ones express their feelings to you ever."
"we have known each other since we were 7 because of school. our parents married when we were 13. his mom is happy, my mom is happy. they were actually friends in highschool so they both have been supportive. my dad blew it out of proportion and acts like i did it just to ""hurt him"" lol. but i havent spoken face-to-face with my dad since i was 15 or so. so im just hearing what he told my mother in law. my husbands dad didnt care really, he made a few comments but gave up after a while."
"Usually I'd buy into the taboo for this off gut feeling, but, 1, it's not incest and, 2, there really shouldn't be as much taboo on step sibling relationships as there is, especially in this case. I mean, if you knew and were into someone and *then* you're parents married then whatever, dude, nothing weird about that. Also, lets think here, two unrelated kids or teenagers might be into eachother or just friends, but if you stick them in a house together, well, if they don't grow closer from familiarity then they will from hormones. 

I mean, logically, the reason sibling incest is taboo is inbreeding. That's a pretty good reason, sure, but it's not a factor if they're step siblings. The rest of the taboo is from equating the relationship between blood siblings and step siblings, which is stupid because those situations are more often than not fundamentally different. Like in OP's case, they did not have the same relationship as two people who grew up from infancy together.

I guess I'm just trying to say that the taboo is stupid and I'm sorry you have to deal with it.

So, question time, I guess. Do you plan on keeping the whole step sibling thing under wraps when you can, to avoid the stigma?"

"I'm sorry you're dealing with people who are attacking you.

"I'd just like to thank you for making my daughter smile on our trip to Disneyland.  I had not seen her so happy in a long time.

[Here she is](http://m.imgur.com/gallery/eQPWQj8)"
I was homeless in Tucson for a few months one time.  Not a fun place to be on the streets.  One night I was sick of sleeping on rocks and waking up and 100 degree sunlight at 7am so I snuck into the u of A stadium and slept on the only grass I could find in town.  A guy woke me up and said I had to leave but if I needed money I could come back for the game that night and sell eegees in the stands.  I made about $200 and bought a ticket back to my hometown where I slowly got my life back on track.  I've always had a soft spot for them ever since.
I teach art to first graders in Shanghai now
Lol cute. I'm not from here though. but there are no states in the US that have any laws regarding step-sibling marriage.
Duck yeah bot good work!
are you from America?

"I just got back from Vegas and while we were there checked out 2 other clubs. Can you talk about some of the culture out in vegas? 

* The girls were pushy to the point of annoying. Forget talking to the people you go with... 
* 2 seconds after you can get a girl to accept you don't want a dance, the next one is in your lap
* Girls slipping condoms in our shirt pockets with a wink. 

We had a random girl whos ""bf was upstairs dancing"" come over to hang out with us. Was she a escort of some sort? How does that relationship with a club work?

How many girls are working at one time on a weekend night?"
Yep. I think I'm tripping too now. 
"No, not at all. My implant which is a few models old now, only hears 23 different levels of sound, tones I guess you would call it. A normal ear has thousands. When I listen to music, it sounds flat, it sounds like all the instruments are jumbled together. One of the hardest things about the implant is overlapping sounds and  differentiating between the sounds. I know what the songs SHOULD  sound like in my brain, if that makes sense. At least the songs I knew from before. And what they sound like now...doesn't compare. So it basically ruined it. I have heard the new models are better, so maybe someday if I can upgrade. There are cochlear implant recipients who do like music, but most are people who were born deaf then implanted. So the don't know what music sounds like away from having the implant. It sound bad to say they don't know any difference, I don't mean it as a negative or and insult, but...they don't know any better."
I wish I was Kevin Spacey.
Me! I fuckin love mirrors on acid they are craaaaaaaazyyyy
"Is this your first chemo session?

"I was a packer and then sometimes on the docks loading trucks. I don't really care about the semantics of the job, the pay was alright, and nobody really jacked me around but it was just so boring. It didn't feel like a job."
"Oh, and TRUCK STOPS! Truck drivers, especially at the Flying J/Pilot, are a goldmine for showers. They often have them stacked up and 50% of the time, they never even use them. 

BUT, do NOT abuse this option! Be aware that managers at these places will take notice of you if you're there too often - even if you're a paying customer - and they will not hesitate to kick you off the property, either verbally or with a police escort. 

When I did this, I'd rotate around to different truck stops. Honesty usually works; drivers are tired and don't always want to bullshit with random strangers; however, they're also 8 times out of 10 awesome people who are very happy to help. Just ask them if they have an extra shower on their Pilot card - and if they do, they'll help you out."
"The older generation is stuck in their ways but it has pretty much older white guys who have made the laws and sat on the courts.

"Sure...Strip clubs in Vegas hire TONS of girls cause each dancer has to pay about $100 (more or less depending on what time it is) to clock into work cause its how the clubs make money...Spearmint Rhino will have about 200 on a typical Friday night and its sounds like you went to Sapphires which would have even more...

That makes it insanely competitive for the dancers so they can get pretty pushy...

Sapphire has male strippers and female strippers. Sometimes some of them date...that particular case doesn't sound any different from any other workplace relationship at a straight job honestly...Im guessing he came over to hang out cause he's comfortable with her dancing and she could tell you weren't gonna drop a ton of cash (we can tell) whether you met her bf or not so she figured why lie about it.

Girls slipped condoms in your shirt with a wink? That I can't explain... But some dancers do hook for sure, but most of them (me included) know the best way to make money is to lead a customer to believe that there's a chance we'll have sex if you spend money at the club first...

So it's extremely common for dancers to promise to meet customer outside of work when they have no real intention of doing so.

Does that answer all your questions?

I used to be in a pretty serious relationship with the promotions guy at Spearmint Rhino when I was working there.  I had no idea people might think the relationship was sketchy...I'll have to be more carefull who I mention that to in the future now =P"
"I do, actually - I am in medicine and studying to be a nurse, and from all I have learned, I believe that a fetus is its own living entity from 8 weeks, when it has its own heartbeat. That is why I would never get an abortion myself. However, I can't make that decision for others. I've heard the argument that it's not really murder if it's a fetus because they could never survive on their own outside the womb, so they are essentially a tumor. Medically, that is accurate, but morally it's a different story. "
"Privacy... Changing your clothes while living in your car, not easy. Taking a dump in a bathroom stall, not always fun. Want to relax and find a place to unwind? It's possible, but takes getting to know the area you're in. "
