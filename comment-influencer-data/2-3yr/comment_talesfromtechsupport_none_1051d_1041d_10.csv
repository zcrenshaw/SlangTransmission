Lousy techs!  They refuse to help us with catastrophic issues that we caused.  Why do we pay them?  They do nothing but cost us money!  Even though I didn't follow company policy it MUST be the techs fault for the loss of company money!

I think this is it. I think this is the absolute worst. A client who doesn't understand TIME?! I'm out. How do you set an alarm? Does he know how old he is?
Yup.
"I now read MFP as ""Mother fucking printer.""

"Had a user that called me out for a printer that wasn't working... I plugged it in, and it suddenly worked fine.

A couple days later, the printer isn't working again, and ""this time it's DEFinitely plugged in,"" was sneered. It wasn't self control, I honestly thought this was the bigger burn; I silently walked around the desk, picked up the OTHER end of the power cable, and plugged it into the printer.

"""$AB: Did you forget your passphrase?""

...Yes, yes I did. I have completely forgotten it."
"Fucking techs, I only see them when there are problems! What are they doing the rest of time? Probably nothing. Heck, they're probably the ones who break things since I only see them when things are broken. "
"Nah, you are missing the bright side of it. She didn't ask you to show her how to power on the computer..."

"Big Shot: DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM????

"""Oh man, you should really see a doctor about that broken leg.""

""What broken leg?""

*Crunch* ""That broken leg."""
"""Screw you, future-me!"""
Turning it off then turning it back on solves a lot of problems but a part of me has died due to how many times someone asked for help only to find out that something was unplugged

"Just make sure the items you put asset tags on are actually owned by your company.

We had a guy working for us a few years ago who brought in his personal laptop for some reason, was away from his desk for lunch, and when he came back he found that it had been asset-tagged."

"Believe it. I also know what bastard created the sheets, where he lives (down to his home address, with Street View), that he likes visiting Disney World (but who doesn't?), considers himself a marketing genius, buys switchblades, and has absolutely no taste or skill in web design, plus doesn't know how to edit a Wordpress theme to remove the theme creator's mailto link from the bottom (where it has his in text, but clicking it sends to the theme creator's address, topkek)."
"You should be **proud**.

Also totally loved this:

Clearly the client in OP's tale is a hyper-evolved multi-dimensional being for whom time has no meaning. 
You fixed one system and $Newbie already forgot how it was done. His laptop now is the most valuable. 
Yup. Am doing so. Going slow and careful. Dotting every I and crossing every T. Including adding stuff like network port each device is plugged into (so I can make a network map later without having to redo my work)

I don't know to laugh or be concerned.
"The unfortunate thing is that there those in companies that _are_ ""important enough"" to override every policy in place for such things. Would you have had a way to know if this was a real higher up as opposed to someone who had too high of an opinion of themselves?"
O M G !!!!
"That's why I never tell them no.  I explain how much it will cost, and the time involved.  (Usually adding a couple grand and about 20% on the time...)"
"Standard behaviour. My company has something similar but every step must be caught on camera (law, not interesting enough to explain)

Plant manager calls 'camera X has broke'. 

Not a problem good sir there are 3 ready configured spares in Loc Y (remote site, this reduces any downtime)

He says ""there isn't, we used them all"".

Strike 1: how did they add the camera to the system? (They didn't, they completely jury rigged it, was actually not legal)

Strike 2: didn't tell IT.

Strike 3: left not only that section of the plant unoperational but put the rest of it in jeopardy by removing all the spares.

Important to know that we import these cameras from China at up to 1/10th of the cost, hence the huge lead time. Felt good to be given immediate auth for 3 at full price."
"What he really meant was that he didn't have time to wait for the help desk to place him in their work queue at a reasonable position in such a way that he will get his problem fixed in line with everyone else.

&gt;$manager: - and now $department is internally invoicing us for $frustrated's paid time off, since you approved it. Who gave you that authority? 

&gt;$Wurd: All I said was -

"Once fully trained and working for a month, that hesitation regarding moving things will probably be gone and the next time you hear from her it'll be because she moved her computer too far over the edge of her desk to get to the headphone port and it fell on the floor, popped open, and spilled everywhere."

"I know computers run on magic smoke and tiny demons, but they still need electricity to work.
