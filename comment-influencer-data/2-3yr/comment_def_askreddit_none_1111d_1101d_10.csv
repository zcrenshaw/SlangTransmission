"AIM (AOL Instant Messenger). Seriously, my entire high school and college social life revolved around this program. I would have like 5 to 10 message windows open at anyone time, The speakers blaring out that annoying ""baa-ling!"" sound every 2 seconds. Anytime I got a new computer or laptop, that was the first download, had to make sure I was on AIM with little to no down time.

In a time when cell phones really only were for phone calls, or maybe you had a texting plan, but you had to use that pain in the ass T9 system (1=ABC, 2=DEF, etc.) AIM ruled supreme for a long time, but dam did smart phone texting put an abrupt stop to that.

EDIT: I've been corrected: The1 button was for punctuation, 2 started with ABC. I never knew T9 had such a huge following, fucking Reddit. My original claim still stands, I hated typing that way."
"One night in college I left my apartment to go to a party at my girlfriend's place. I headed over early, maybe 8sh, to just hang out and drink beer because college girl parties are weird and dumb and start at 11 for no goddamn reason. But I digress. 

About an hour later I realize I'd forgot my weed, so I walked back to my place. 

I hear music thumping and figure there's no way it's my apartment. My roommates weren't big party people. Get outside the door and it's def my place. 

I open the door. The lights are off. A strobe light is going. Weird techno-ish music is blasting. Most of the dudes present are shirtless, seemingly tripping balls, and totally covered in red paint for some reason. 

Unintelligible yelling in my direction as I walk in.

""JUST NEED MY POT YOU GUYS HAVE FUN I HAVE TO GO NOW BYE BYE"""
