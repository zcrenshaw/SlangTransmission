0,"Yeah, I agree. I think you did as much as anyone reasonably could be expected to in this scenario.  It just went the way it did, and it just sucks. No one is really at fault, just unfortunate someone got hurt.  "
1,It was very exhausting. Half way through I felt like I was reading a post from a teenager. Not a man who was married with four kids. Hope he finds the solutions he's looking for and finds peace.
2,I'm not sure how deep down this chocolate rabbit hole my brain can go.  We've reached the event horizon of food fractions.
3,"Or he saw it happen to a friend, that's why my guard is up. Vasalgel couldn't come soon enough... "
4," I have no idea whether meds are appropriate for you or not, but you will have a tough time in therapy if you automatically reject anything except what you want to hear. "
5,"Fuck this in its entirety. I'm a non-mentally healthy adult(skitzo) and I don't get treated like this. I say I need to go out, no or little questions are asked, I go do what I need to, and I come back before I need to take care of my responsibilities.

This is so unhealthy on many levels, and nobody should get treated like this unless they are a danger to themselves or others. And in that case they should be getting professional medical treatment, not stalked.

I'm unfit to work, and get financial support from family. They still don't track my every move, there is trust and understanding that I can make good choices based on past choices."
6,"Doesn't mean they shouldn't. Lots of people don't wear seat belts and drink and drive, these people don't get a lot of sympathy when they face the consequences of their actions. Same goes for a college aged kid who has a bad trip because they took drugs without thinking about that."
7,Why are your jobs going to go away?
8,"I think that you're getting way too wrapped up in the semantics of this thing and you're not really listening to your boyfriend.

It doesn't matter that you think he's wrong about when the ""engagement"" starts; what matters is that you want to take steps that he's saying he's not ready to take. He's also given you a rough timeline of when he thinks he'll be ready to start taking those steps with you (for whatever idiosyncratic reason). I agree that it's kind of a silly game, but if you want to be partners then sometimes you have to deal with whatever weird thing they're thinking about.

&gt;I believe a couple should have pre-engagement conversations to make sure both people are on the same page so they can move the process forward

Are there any of these conversations you can have? Even if it's not specifically tied to marriage or engagement like what you plan on doing after law school, what he's planning on doing with his career along with the old ""where do you see yourself in five years"" kind of thing?

IDK, I think if you're okay with waiting a year for the actual proposal (which seems like what you discussed) then patience is probably best unless you're really picky about rings or your pre-engagement discussion is going to involve months of tense negotiations. In which case, maybe just look at some rings on your own to see what you like?

ETA: I think in his framing, the proposal and the acceptance are just a bit of icing on the cake. It's teh thing that seals the deal so to speak."
9,"Take the spray and squirt it in both of their faces and see how 'fine' it is then.

Idiots! "
10,"&gt;He told me I didn't need to learn this stuff because ""only sluts read up on sex or watch stuff to seduce men into their webs"" and I was a sweet girl who didn't need that. It offended me because I'm obviously not a slut, but reading up on sex was interesting. I told him that and he told me if I didn't stop, I'd become less attractive to him??? I stopped telling him about it, but I do still read up on it. 

...and then you just let this go?? WTF? 

You are dating a full blown mysogynist. One of the ways you can identify one is that a lot of the time they seem to have this virgin/whore dichotomy going on with regards to their views on women. All females are either one, or the other. Because it's not like women are actual 3-dimensional human beings or anything to them. In case you haven't yet guessed it, this is a giant red flag. 

And by the way, once you dump this douchebag, most guys out there will be over the moon to have a GF who is so sexually adventurous and open minded. Your BF is the exception here. Leave him in the dust."
11,"&gt; You know... if these people were genuinely interested in Julia, they would've been calling and helping her long distance with things like her period. 

The fucked up thing is, they *aren't* long distance. My mother lives 15 minutes away in bad traffic. The sister throwing a fucking temper tantrum lives less than that. They could have tried to see her at any time, they just didn't fucking care.

&gt; Get that lawyer. Prioritize Julia and it's okay to stop talking to the jerks. They seem to work on their tornado of rage and it's gaining speed. But do take care of you. It's okay to date, it's okay to have a partner and a life for your side that's not Julias guardian. Talk to Julia herself on how she wants to approach things relationshipwise with these people. Be sure you're on the same page.

Getting a lawyer after Christmas, because this shit has gone on too long. I'm not prepared to date yet, Julia right now needs stability, and me dating would disrupt the delicate balance we've got going right now. 

I have talked to Julia multiple times about our living situation, and how to deal with our family. She won't talk to my mother at all, says she hates her. My mother asked Julia if I was abusing her on the phone behind my back, and ever since Julia has been very willing to voice her opinion on my mother.

&gt; Julia already lost her parents, it's sad that your relatives are ruining the rest of what she has in family to prove their side.

Exactly how I feel. Makes me furious to know how much they're hurting her by acting like this. She needs stability and love, not this.

13,"Did you read the original? Being a bridesmaid requires a lot more than just attending the wedding and OP wasn't even sure she was going to be able to do that. It's a commitment of time, money, and travel. Not everyone can do it. "
14,Tell your family that she is senile.
15,"This is the same excact situation I found myself into last year with a girl but it was even shorter as we started dating at the end of the school year.  When we first started dating we agreed to end it when she went to college.  Let me tell you, I had the best summer of my life with that girl and truly made memories with her.  In those 4 months I fell in love with her, and I think she fell in love with me.  At first, I would kind of moap around thinking about how eventually she would have to go and we would be no more.  Finally I had enough with myself and decided to not think about it and just live in the moment.  Thats the best thing that I could of done. We created a bucket list with 20 or so things to do by the end of the summer. I had a blast.  The last week was probably my favorite, even with the looming thoughts of her leaving.  When she left, I was broken.  For a good 2 months she was all I thought about, but I learned that I had to let her go.  Now I only have happy thoughts about the summer I spent with her.  I know we will never get back together, and thats how I want it too be.  I looked at it as more as an experience than anything.  Its a valuable experience to go through, it changed me forever.  My only regret is not communicating all my feelings properly, I felt that since she was leaving it was pointless, but it hurt me even more.  Best of luck, pm if you want to talk or have questions"
16,"It's hard because you fear change. But you shouldn't - change is coming. This doesn't go back to the way it was before, it only goes on forward in the world where her infidelity is something you know about. 

But you get to decide whether you live in the world where you're just waiting for her to do it again, or the world where you get to put this in your past and build a future with someone who shows you the respect you're due. "
17,"Exactly! And there's a reason why many people migrate from Eastern Europe to other countries- there are very few jobs available, working conditions aren't great, etc. Why and what are his plans for moving back so soon? By all means travel together but no matter how great e seems doing all this seems dangerous. This is how people get sold into human trafficking."
18,"Not judging at all, just working off those details that you provided yourself. Which are that you're living in this woman's house not paying rent or bills, she presumably didn't know you at all when you suddenly married her son and moved into her house. Again, she sounds quite unpleasant but she is housing you for free and she didn't have to agree to this. If you *really had to*, you and your husband could find other options and move out (even if it's with roommates or a crappy apartment or whatever). So living with her is a choice and a tradeoff you are making to save money. Either deal with it the best you can or move out. "
19,"What's more important to you: your bf or your future children? In my opinion, he's in denial and will most likely delay baby making even more than what he's telling you. If kids are really your dream, it might be best to break up and move on. Based on your timeline, you can't waste anymore time on him ignoring this conversation. He must talk or lose you. If he's more scared of talking than losing you, you have your answer."
20,"This is very, very serious. I strongly urge you to get a restraining order, and take advice from lots of people you talk to (police, lawyers, crisis centers, therapists, etc). They are all used to dealing with this stuff and should provide better perspective than reddit can.

But your life is absolutely in danger. Take steps to be vigilant, and buy a gun if you can. If not, a knife or pepper spray. It'll be hard for him to hurt you if his eyes are gouged out. There is a crazy guy hell-bent on terrorizing you.

Also, the guy you're currently dating sounds incredibly emotionally immature. Unless you really want a future with him, just be like ""this won't work between us"" and leave it at that. He wouldn't understand even if you explained perfectly.

Also, I'd speak with a therapist about finding healthy relationships! These guys are both huge losers for various reasons."
21,"The part of the conversation I was able to screenshot has no replies from the guy. Unfortunately I wasn't able to get more before she deleted them. I know in my state I can record without her knowing, would this be a good idea?"
22,"Yeah, I'm not going to be inviting Julian to any more parties. I mean, jesus christ, he was bombed last night. Handling a gun in my kitchen, feet away from all of my friends. I'm not one of those ""guns kill people!!!"" people, but seriously, accidents happen! 

I'm shocked that Jay is so cavalier about this. He usually has much better judgment."
23,"No, no, no, never go to bed angry means that the two of you should be mature enough to put aside whatever the disagreement is and continue your discussion when you're both refreshed. It absolutely does not mean wake your girlfriend up and rage at sleepy her. People do not react their best when tired, it's not a good time to have a productive discussion. Forcing someone into a conversation rarely gets you the outcome you'd hoped for."
24,"It's hardly expecting the marriage to end. It's insurance for the occasion IF something were to happen. Life is difficult, you never know what will happen. Imagine you ended up owning 80% of your joint belongings, then 10 years down the line you've grown apart and divorce is the best option, would you not be raging if he took half even if it wasn't rightfully his? "
25,"The gender expectation cuts both ways. There are men who are put off by a woman asking them out, because they ""like the chase""/think she's desperate/feel emasculated. Then there are the guys who aren't afraid to ask women out who didn't ask because they don't want to go out with you, so they say no.

The rejection rate is super high for both sexes, shockingly, because no one can read minds.

Source: not-hideous woman who has always made the first move and almost always been rejected."
26,"&gt;When you refuse to say no to her you're saying no to me.

This comment is great! That's exactly how I feel when my boyfriends mom just KEEPS on calling for him. Mayble he'll understand it phrased like this."
27,"God forbid your son ever has some money. Your husband is a loser, a loser who steals from his own freaking child at that."
28,"OP, there is a trend here. He pushes off telling them about the baby, he pushes off setting a date. He's going to keep doing this unless you make him realize that it's not okay and not acceptable. It's really important that you start sorting this stuff out because you don't want to be butting heads with him AND your MIL once the baby is born. Plus you need to know that he's going to back you up! "
29,"I've actually found the opposite to be true so far. I've met plenty of people here (boyfriend's family and friends), and he has to constantly prod them to speak in English around me so as not to be rude. They just default to Dutch all the time, which makes sense because that's their first language."
30,"Together with my (25F) boyfriend (25M) for a year and 3 months today.
This is a year, 3 months and 17 days after our first Tinder chat. 

We matched, chatted, and clicked instantly. We spent about two dates dancing around each other, and 10 days after our first date I asked him to be my boyfriend, because I just knew he was the one.
I hope to spend the rest of my life with him! &lt;3

When asked how we met, I always honestly say through Tinder, but generally preface it with some comment on its silliness and, I kid you not, *every* person I've told this to has been supportive of us, telling me that it's not weird at all, and wishing us the best.

We spend lots of time together, playing Mario Kart on the Wii, or Runescape on our laptops (old school,  but we love it!), going on dates, going to our ballroom dancing classes,  studying together, or even just enjoying being in the same room, doing nothing. We just recently started to read a book together (reading aloud to one another, to practice our English, but also to share the experience) and I really hope we'll keep it up, as it's so intimate and fun! We also do D&amp;D, and play lots of boardgames with friends... It's a wonder we find time to spend with just the two of us! (But therein lies the secret: we *make* that time ;) )

Keep hope, all you lovely single people out there! There is someone out there for you, who shares all your silly passions (we tried running together, then decided this really wasn't our sport, and are now into squash), who will love you for who you are, who will help you up when you're down, who will be your rock, and who you cannot help but love in return.

You just have to find them. Be it on Tinder, in a cafe, at school/uni, at a meetup, or perhaps even literally bumping into them in the street. Keep your eyes open, work on yourself and your own happiness in the meantime, and enjoy the holidays.

Merry Christmas everyone, and a Happy New Year filled with love to come!
"
31,"Similar thing happened to me. Grandparents didn't take an interest in us, choosing to just spoil favourite cousins instead. Fast forward and I don't have anything but forced politeness toward them, and they bitch about the fact that we aren't interested in seeing them. Thems the breaks. I'm closer to my husband's grandmother, so I'm glad I still get to have that 'Nanna experience'."
32,The nursery is not at fault here. OP probably had her boyfriend on the approved list of people who could pick up her daughter because she mentions in another comment that she called and had him removed from the approved list. 
33,"It's not that everyone is ugly, I'm just utterly apathetic/indifferent to their attractiveness. Maybe how you would feel as a straight person seeing a person of the same sex? My brain isn't interested in making a judgment about their attractiveness or romantic availability. They're just a person walking down the street. "
34,"If what's going on, is completely platonic, there's no trap to set; just another phone call with a friend. 

If his actions, past and present are telling me something is up, I'm pulling whatever I can out to get the truth. 

The situation presented offers no opportunity for him to give her a heads up that I'm onto them, no heads up to delete texts/convos. 

So you see, theres no trap unless he had set it up himself. And if that's what it takes, then so fucking be it because fuck that. "
35,"I know right, what circle of hell did you find this woman in OP?"
36,Did you give him a thumbs up to show how fine you were?
37,"Offer to stay at thier house with nephew so they can have a night away if you really want sleepovers.  Don't push the cat issue - either his symptoms are worse at night (common), that his symptoms are manageable only with shorter visits, or they need the consistency in order to maintain proper boundaries with your MIL without upsetting your nephew. Meanwhile do what you can to allergy proof your home (hepa filters, regular vacuuming, anti-dander products, no cat policy for the guest room, etc) so that nephew will have the least symptoms possible. Don't brag about how you've done so or hint that your actions mean sleepovers will be okay, wait for them to notice the symptom reduction and approach you on the subject. "
38,Amy isn't cut out for decent society. 
39,"your mother is abusing you. This is not a privacy issue this is a sexual abuse issue. How would you feel if your dad or other male family member peeped at you in the shower? Lifted your clothes while you slept? Not allow you to close your bedroom door? Made comments about your breasts? 

You need to leave ASAP.

ETA: if you are still in high school see if you can move in with a friend until graduation, and/or talk to a school counselor who can maybe point you towards community resources. If you can't move or you want to stay, then you need to start being assertive with your mom. Close and lock the bathroom door and cover up the crack, or get a gym membership and shower there. Close and lock your bedroom door so she can't come touching on you while you sleep. You can buy locks. Tell her to keep her hands off of you, say STOP. I know this all seems very scary but if your mother hasn't been hitting you thus far she is unlikely to start now, so BE VOCAL and tell her to STOP. Get a job so you can pay for your own phone and save money so you can move. At 18 you can open your own bank account so close out any account you have with her now and do that."
40,Nah. Next step is he might start wandering around people's apartments. Also you don't want your gf to be harassed late at night. There are shelters.
41,"You can love someone and still feel conflicted over having to accept a lot of changes. And maybe she doesn't want to head her own business. We should be careful to not make assumptions about what her choices and feelings should be. 

He's asking her to move away from her family, become more dependent on him (temporarily), and leave a job she's getting along really well with - that's a shit load of change to have to consider and reach a decision about in one darn week. You can love someone and still have difficulty swallowing significant changes. "
42,"And he's paying rent, is not like he's a freeloader without a sense of responsability."
43,A toxic person is still a toxic person when they get pregnant.
44,And then her professor grades her more harshly than she deserves for her advances and her academics suffer because she said no to a person who should not have been making moves on her in the first place.
45,"My sweat and BO after playing hockey is natural too, it doesn't mean that I don't take a shower as soon as I'm off the ice. 

What a bizarre man. "
46,"&gt; It's some combination of social anxiety, laziness (or, more specifically, social exhaustion/burnout), and this weird feeling of independence that can kind of border on arrogance. Like, I just don't want any more ""plans"" in my life. Not with my free time, anyway. I want the option to show up ...or not.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I realize that this isn't a fair or realistic way to approach relationships with other people, and I don't want to lose them or hurt them in the process of keeping them at arms' length. So I just keep my responses to invitations purposefully vague: ""yeah! definitely! we should do that some time."" **It is my hope that this will mean they know I like them but also hold them off from trying to ""lock in"" some sort of definite plan (which, to me, feels aggressive and unnecessary and usually intrusive). **

...no, I would not get that from you at all.  After a couple of those, I'll assume that you're not interested in being anything more than acquaintances and move on."
47,"&gt; affirmative consent is assumed,

That's not how that works. ""Affirmative consent"" is an active thing, *not* a passive one.

Sure, you can set it up like you have, but ""affirmative consent is assumed"" is very similar to ""driving in park,"" or ""soft hard."""
48,"They are much better for the older person, avoid the scammers, have a better match rate, and indeed are highly likely to result in a very happy outcome. Basically, she goes for an interview/questionnaire, discuss her expectations and preferences, and they look for someone who is compatible. It really works. It's not free of course."
49,"Why is that funny? Is your resentment with her because she isn't being abused by your parents? Or is it because you feel she's being disrespectful and unappreciative? 

You seem very jaded right now, and I encourage you to focus on what you really want out of this situation. I'm sure it is not for her to be belittled, ridiculed, humiliated, punished and called names."
50,"Yeah it was getting bad but I threw my hands up at ""I hacked her work cell."" Said like, ""I made a sandwich"" or ""I went for a jog around the park."" DA FUQ?! Not healthy. Needs to end immediately."
51,"People who navigate open relationships have these types of conversations fairly often. People can be very blunt in the polyamory community. But when monogamous people dip into open relationships/non-monogamy, they tend to communicate like the OP."
52,"&gt;It's not like they are outrageously homophobic but they are very traditional in their beliefs 

Your family are outrageously homophobic. You need to be upfront with Nia - tell her they found out she's bi and now neither of you are going there for the holidays because they're homophobic bigots. I'm sorry dude. "
53,"That sounded more like a compromise to me. He's tired of how much time she spends and her makeup getting all over his clothing (which happens with heavy layers of foundation), so toning it down would take less time and help with the smearing. "
54,"Depends on what ""unfinished"" means here ... No Heating and water? Open walls? Or just that it is not fully furnished and maybe the floor isn't perfect yet?"
55,"If he's still messaging you, yes.  One final communication telling him, unconditionally, that you don't want to hear from him again.  No wiggle room.  "
56,He sounds like he doesn't know you very well 
57,"He doesn't love you. He loves the idea of you, the fantasy he's built about who you are while you've been absent in his life. He's got a flame for you that he's unwilling to put out, even though he acts like it's not there.

The absolute best thing to do is forfeit any hopes of being anything but utter strangers to each other. Not friends, not casual acquaintances - even the most innocent and tempered communication will be kindling for his misplaced romance.

Go no-contact, block him on every available venue. Double check how private your social media settings are. Personally, I wouldn't even bother telling him that he overstepped and disrespected - he's not an idiot, he can figure it out. He might pine for you and be bitter about it for some time, but that's his issue, not yours.
"
58,"So, so many people have known after one year too and it turns out they didn't know after all. I'm not gonna give you crap for being 22 as young as that is, but being with someone for a year and committing to the rest of your life together is not as obvious as it sounds. Even if you've known them all your life, dating somebody is different and things get tricky 2-3 years in "
59,Very smart plan.  Never respond emotionally if you can help it.  Have a fabulous wedding!   
60,"Exactly.  You could argue that he shouldn't care, but he said he did.  Also, does he care about his ex's bff that he slept with?  Because that just forever tanked that relationship...  Of course the ex-bff is an adult and should have known better if she wanted to have a friendship with OP's ex."
61,You shouldn't interact with them anymore. Get a restraining order. 
62,I must be petty as fuck because I love the cards anecdote.
63,"I could win (maybe) if I did absolutely everything she asked, but that's just not gonna happen. A sleep specialist is what she needs. "
64,[removed]
65,"Who cares what he says?! Clearly what he says is complete and utter bullshit! Judge someone by their actions, not their words. "
66,Fuckin click bait man....  Gets me every time.
67,"You don't have to do anything, she's going to blow up her own world."
68,"I think you were correct in speaking to an attorney. He's not being straightforward, and he's not being a good partner in the marriage. ! $700 charge that he's not showing you? Keep your separate account and continue putting money in it. Bring this up at counseling. "
69,"Yup. New Year, New You. 

Making 2017 the year of the dodged bullet. "
70,His problem appears to be poor taste in women.
71,"I think you are being unreasonable. You have no problem with them being friends which is great! Your boyfriend loves you and picked you! He has been with you for 8 years and want to marry you! Why are you so hard on yourself? You are beautiful now and will be a stunning bride. The day should be about you, your boyfriend, and sharing the day with people that love and support you. 

I think you need to start working on your self esteem no matter the outcome. Start by standing in front of the mirror once a day and looking at yourself. Pick something new that you love and say it out loud. I love my ears. I love my eyes. Learn to love yourself. Be fierce. "
72,"If you know the relationship is over, you should just end it ASAP and begin the process of moving on. A break up isn't a trial jury, no evidence is required, you don't have to catch her in the act of having a romantic date, you have plenty of good reasons to end it (I wouldn't endure a relationship with her lying and lacking trust). And my advice to shove a lie in her face as the departing act isn't actually going to do you much good, either. Since you've been with her so long, maybe doing it over text is also pretty tacky. But you still need to do it ASAP."
73,"&gt;I worry about his mental stability because he loses his shit during arguments and scares the fucking bejeezus out of me

This alone is a huge red flag and a complete deal breaker. "
74,"If you want her to uproot her life for you, you should marry her. 

"
75,Don't let it mess with your trust too much.  Some people are just really good liars. 
76, I think he's honestly just trying to see if you're okay! I know you find it annoying but it might just mean he cares about you and wants you to enjoy yourself. Maybe have the conversation about what you want to do before you get down and dirty so he knows you're into it? 
77,"The majority of my post addressed the lie, not them living together. But if she wants to ignore good advice just because someone said something she wants to hear, that's on her. She's young. She'll either learn from her mistakes, or she'll be stubborn and be hurt by them.

"
78,Yeah. It's a little too late to ask for help now. Was to upset/tired to really fight it at the time and was more hurt than anything. Still am. 
79,It's not judgemental to want fair treatment and to not have your things thrown out.
80,"&gt;  We both feel ready to take a step towards a relationship.

dude. FFS clear your head first on WHAT you are looking for. Everywhere I see you mixing up the next step   

Let me spell it out   

A) FWB - no strings attached fuck buddy ...no relationship/emotional connect bullshit here  

B) Relationship : All bells &amp; whistles.    

If you are looking for a Mrs. Robinson-esque deal(from what I see thats what you want)...sure go ahead. But make the score clear to her.   
If you looking for a relationship ....there are a ton of red flags I'd be reeeealy wary about. And I'd tell you preferably not proceed ahead with her.

But first step...get a good grip on what you want.

83,"&gt; I refused to give him any more money, he blocked me on Facebook. He then had his entire family block me on Facebook.

That will teach you!"
84,What country are you from? Haha
85,"Amen. OP, he knew what he was doing. He chose a student in a vulnerable spot and then groomed them. He has *no* place in academia."
86,TIL Dutch language is useless in Amsterdam. 
87,"Stop falling for this. She's literally making you crazy. Stop it.

You can't win because if you had shown up that would have been the wrong thing to do as well because Reasons. Just step off the crazy train and let her carry on by herself."
88,I would be genuinely shocked if it takes 3 months.
89,"&gt;I though exchanging looks in silence was enough. Now I know that unless I have a thick wallet and six-pack, girls won't even look in my direction. 

Right. Silent glances or six pack. Absolutely nothing at all in between those two options. /s 

If this is for real and not a troll tryin' to get on r/niceguys- this would be my advice. Desperation is not going to attract anyone. Don't look for a girlfriend. Don't ""girlfriendzone"" every woman you meet and interact with. Work on being happy with your life and your hobbies and making friends. Build your confidence. "
90,"I get why she wouldn't want to leave a job at a fortune 500 company for one in the suburbs. It may be an assumption, but I doubt she can have the same kind of connections, income, and benefits by working near your home. Is that what she says?  If so, I can't really blame her, and I think that's probably a risk that SHE will have to take in order to be comfortable in your home. To do that for a man who hasn't proposed/no proposal on the horizon is risky for her if she wants marriage and a fruitful career worthy of her talents. "
91,"No, this is not a Best Case Scenario type situation. However, millions of babies are born every year under way waay waaaaay worse conditions. You're not the one in control here. You can smash your fists against the rocks all you want, it's not going to make any difference. 

Be a big sister, not a mother."
92,"God, that one cuts into my heart. Not ready to let go of this friend at all."

94,"Well what are the superficial reasons? Most of the time does are to do with looks. Do they presume you ""brought"" her? "
95,"Your theater charges a Disney fee?

I'm honestly just curious lol"
96,"Okay, 50 miles in Detroit is a big commute because traffic around Detroit is a nightmare. No one wants to be stressed out in traffic and come ""home"" to a place that isn't really their home.

I think that she needs to work on compromising but also, maybe she doesn't like the house you live in because it isn't welcoming to her. Maybe she wants to live in a house you pick together, in a neighborhood you pick together. I lived with an ex and when I moved in, I wasn't allowed to paint, or change thing. It all had to stay the way he wanted because it was ""his"" house and I was just living there. Not super great. Just saying. "
97,"Pardon me if I'm mistaken here but here's what I understand:

You and your SO go to places where his schlong (and not his schlort) is in plain view, though it's not an inherently sexual setting. That's cool. Kinda jealous, wish I could do that sort of thing. 

You have spent lots of time in this setting as a child and through adulthood and you've never seen anyone being overtly sexual in this setting. Nifty! 

Your SO is more well endowed, especially visibly than anyone you've been with. 

Only now are you being exposed to sexual questions and propositions of the sexual nature and it's bizarre to you. 

Did I hit the main points? If so then:

Your SO has a sought-after physical characteristic that is visible when it otherwise wouldn't be (ie to the majority of the population who regretfully spends the majority of their lives sweating into terribly uncomfortable bits of cotton and elastic). And it surprises you that people, who spend a lot, if not the majority of their time, in our sweaty cotton world notice the trunk that doesn't fit his trunks?

This sounds to me like the male equivalent of men checking out a large-chested woman at a nude beach, with the cultural exception that openly discussing or propositioning a man doesn't tend to draw *the same kind* of negative reaction. 

I suspect this isn't actually about other people being attracted to your SO's obvious physical qualities so much as it is about you seeing that the nudist scene does have a sexual side. Are the others ruining your culture or are you only now being exposed to a new part of your culture? 

That's not an indictment of anyone. That's a massive paradigm shift to find that the way you've always interpretated your culture may not be the whole culture, or worse, you misunderstood your culture altogether. 

Ask yourself some questions, then talk to your SO. Is it a problem that people are sexually attracted to someone your are also sexually attracted to? What is actually happening here; where is the frustration. Is the problem his nudity, interlopers breaking your perception of your culture, or the realization that your understanding of the culture you grew up in may not be complete? 

This is a lot bigger than having him cover up or not be in the nude setting entirely (though both are still, I suppose, reasonable options, I don't think it addresses the actual problem in a tangible way) "
98,"Fire her.  It's your company and she's undermining you at every turn.  YOU'RE THE BOSS!  It's that simple.  She loves being the boss? Let her start her own company.

That sounds harsh?  Take a look at what you just wrote.  How would you reply to someone if you were looking at it as an outsider?  She is belittling you and ruining your self esteem - not acceptable OP.  Not acceptable in the slightest!  You CAN turn this round.  You WILL be able to turn this round.  But she's cancer - you gave her a chance and she's taken advantage and she won't stop - she has no reason to.  You've been nice and let it slide, but now you see what she's doing and it's up to you to wrestle control back.  You deserve to, you NEED to.  Your self-esteem demands it, the success of your business demands it, your employees demand it.

YOU CAN DO THIS.  GET YOUR BUSINESS BACK - IT'S YOURS - YOU CONCEIVED IT, YOU STARTED IT, YOU BUILT IT.  She's not some Bond Villain/Lex Luthor character, she's just a standard parasite with a good line in chat taking advantage of your kindness and good nature.  Welp, now the kindness has run out, and therefore so has her suckling on the teat of your inaction.  

What's the worst that can happen?  You have to do the work that she's appropriated for herself?  You need to learn some stuff?  You have to win back the respect of your employees? (I'll bet they are *willing* you to step up).

Take a deep breath, grit your teeth, and be a business person.  Protect your business, your employees, your self-esteem and your sanity.  KICK HER OUT NOW!"
99,"So have Marvin inherit the house and the other two split all other assets equally...and just do whatever you want with the house when it's yours. You can enact whatever plan you want for living together as one big family after FIL passes without any mention of that plan in the will, and if you are concerned the other siblings won't stick to the plan (and want to hold them to it via a will), then you shouldn't be all living together in that arrangement anyway. "
100,"Definitely investigate this. I had almost the same experience - was not depressed, but I have a sleeping disorder which was undiagnosed. Acted very much as your gf, but after treatment my life is much better and I am a much better gf."
101,"in OPs responses the common denominator seems to be that if she tries to talk to her husband about anything he doesn't want to talk about he gets mad at her and won't communicate in an adult manner. That seems like a bigger problem overall for your relationship than this one incidence (although it is a pretty sketchy situation, sil could have killed someone) You should be able to talk to your husband about things you disagree on "
102,Stop projecting. This is not the place to work out your own issues about step-parenthood. 
103,"""I have a strong need for harmony and conflict makes me want to retreat into a corner and cover my ears and close my eyes.""


The scary part is you think this will be ""all better"" once you find the ""perfect girl."" You need to talk to a professional... seriously. What will *actually* happen is you'll find a girl who's shelled the fuck out like you, and NEITHER of you will develop a backbone..... the way you're looking at this is not healthy."
104,"&gt;So I basically can't trust anything he is telling me.

You never will. 

&gt;Is this marriage salvageable?

No. "
105,"If you save all of your correspondence and make it clear to the University that you were seriously worried about your academic career when you went to him, and made that clear to him, it gives them more ammunition against him.  It will make them more likely to support you being able to stay at the school as well.  

It is obvious why  he switched from email to phone...because it's less traceable, so get a call log showing how often he was in contact with you, save texts, etc.

My Dad was a prof for 43 years.  His advice in these situations is ALWAYS to report.  Chances are you are not the first, nor the last, and the sooner there is a paper trail of his disgusting actions, and valid accusations, the sooner they can remove him from the system.  Don't worry about ruining his career...it's entirely possible he CHOSE this career because it gave him access to vulnerable people."
106,"He said "" I remember asking Janine to stop before and during""

He was also to drunk to give consent."
107,"Look, personally I don't think OP should invest time trying to fix this train wreck, but that's not my decision to make.

However the reason people suggest couples counseling is valid. If OP wants to move forward with the relationship there needs to be a lot of communication and discussion, and having an trained &amp; impartial 3rd party involved in that is going to be helpful. Individual counseling isn't going to help with that at all, though it could certainly be helpful for other reasons."
108,"Yes, and if Dan is OK with that, then that's what should happen. But don't go telling people to respect the wishes of one parent, and ignore the wishes of the other."
109,"Yeah but it's probably in her best interest to have a happy husband, which you're not if you're trying to resolve this.  Maybe tell her she needs to start getting ready earlier if she can't be ready on time.  She should know by now how long it takes to do her makeup and her putting that above any and all other needs seems pretty ridiculous to me.  I understand wanting to look good but if she wants to do that then she needs to start making the time to look good and not cutting into time for other things over her makeup."
110,"Expecting her to give up her whole life she's built for someone she's only dated for a few months is a lot.  

Be honest, communicate how you feel.  Explain how much you like her but that you've always wanted this opportunity, and that you want to do it in a way that works for the two of you.  Be open to compromises like doing an LDR and she comes and visits.  Either way, maximize the next few months."
111,"Don't ""confess"" anything. Break up with Jamie. Spend some time single. Then catch up with Sam and see if there is anything there. Honestly if I were Sam and I knew all this stuff, I'd be massively put off and more than a little creeped out. It's one of those things that sounds great in a romantic movie but in real life is just weird. Couldn't love anyone else because you couldn't move on from a teenage infatuation? You never really even dated Sam properly. You were never such a part of her life to really know her intimately enough to love her and she was right to shut you down about that. You've built up this idea in your head about her. Maybe she truly is amazing and you have great chemistry and together you'd be a brilliant couple - but so much of what you are thinking about her is fantasy, man. It screams low self esteem/self worth (however good looking you think you got, you had to go try and sell it to her like ""hey, but I'm fit now! Come on!""), and she clearly is interested in more than superficial if her boyfriend who she loved was so unattractive. 

Honestly the more I think about it the more creepy it seems. Break up with Jamie - you don't love her and you're leading her on. Then seriously just spend some time single. And when you do eventually see if there's something with Sam (since you seem pretty set on it) try not to unload all this obsessive crap on her and scare her off if she isn't already. "
112,"&gt;Some background: last year I found out he had been messaging a bunch of girls from high school, while I was pregnant about how beautiful they are and how he wasn't sure he was ready to settle down. We were married and these weren't friends of his, just old schoolmates he would randomly message. 

God, that's so immature, gross and embarrassing. I'm sorry."
113,You praised violence. That's a red flag for many women.
114,"Eh.  If it's *that* important to him, then he kinda needs to make it a priority to see the film the day it comes out, or accept that his risk of being exposed to spoilers will increase exponentially after that.  I'm not saying he's not allowed to be annoyed, but this is over the top.  Especially the part where he acts like OP did it deliberately to hurt him.  As others are saying, that's indicative of some issues that go way beyond the movie."
115,Your recommendation teeters on the brink of pressure and coercion which is not compatible with true choice. 
116,"My mom had a saying, ""Learn to live with disappointment"".  Translation is that if all you experience in life is disappointment, then you are a lucky person.

You were treated horribly by your father and stepmother.  You came close to losing your life.  Now you are setting healthy boundaries for yourself and your family.  If the worse thing that happens now is your grandmother being disappointed, then you are being a good husband, father and grandson."
117,"I think you're overreacting. Ask your friend if he and Jennifer both want to come. If not, why does it necessarily ""ruin everything""? I mean it's not a nice move by him, but it's not the end of the world. "
118,Because it's a natural consequence and he's got no one to blame but himself.
119,"I don't think this is a pride issue, I think it's an issue where your SO isn't respecting your boundaries. 

Have you made it clear to him that you don't want your finances discussed? If so, that's super disrespectful for him to say ""yeah, but I was trying to help"" when you point out that he's blatantly disregarding your feelings. "
120,"He probably attempted to play it off as a joke to stoke a jealous streak in you for a moment.  One of those ""Haha! You thought I was texting someone and it was just your sister!"" kinda deals, but it feel super flat.

I'd just chalk it up to something like that and carry on.  If there's no history of suspicious activity, you even *saw* the text and it was super innocent...just let it be."
121,"okay, then.  have a 'couples night' where all four of you are together and you all talk about this situation.  don't do it separately.  that way the two of you can express your solidarity in hatred and explain the situation.  the wives can have their say as well.  maybe you'll come to an agreement. 

staging a fight, while probably ridiculously fun, is a totally boneheaded idea."
122,"I know Martin is an adult so this might be redundant to tell him but make sure he knows that ""when they are both ready"" can mean never and it's ok to cut out toxic fathers from his life "
123,"Not sure which of her jewelry is actually worth anything, considering that to me, they all look like junk and/or worthless. I'm gonna work this out with my dad. Only thing I have that I can sell is my PS3 and a couple of my old phones but its worth something anyway. Job I currently have is only $6/hr because the certificate I need to get better paying jobs is what I'm working to get from the school after its paid. Any other ideas on how I can earn extra cash?"
124,"I am not trying to be pessimistic but maybe he just isn't ready to be engaged.  Why would it be embarrassing to have a long engagement that is typical these days.

You have to just ask.  You've been together 3.5 years ask his intentions, when is his timeline, when would he consider an engagement.  If engagement is a priority to you and not to him you need to know soon due to the length of the relationship. And brass tacks if it comes down to money most people are never going to have enough money.  That's something couples save up for together."
125,"It was an act of anger and it was intended to hurt, why else would he grab the throat? It's not even the best way of dragging someone. I'm sorry but you are viewing this situation through rose colored glasses."
126,"Stayed at her mothers ""spontaneously?"" Even though the weather was bad enough that OP didn't want to drive across town? I think she stayed there because she was scared to drive in the weather.."
127,"I mean I doubt she ""pretended it wasn't yours"", more like she just didn't care that it was since you broke up badly and suddenly she was dealing with the reality of being a single parent of a child she didn't plan for *right* as she was trying to deal with a breakup. It seems more like she just didn't want to have to talk to you and (since you didn't ask for 10 years) I assume you want nothing to do with the kid either. By the time year 4 came around, she probably felt like it wasn't yours at all and that it would be inappropriate to spring that on you as she's newly married or whatever.

I'm not saying it was reasonable of her to do that at all, but I don't think she did it because she ""switched off"". It seems like, ever since she got over the breakup, she's been giving you an out to raising that child and you're taking it."
128,"I'm speaking from my own experience, take whatever you want from it.

When I was in my first serious relationship and we were long distance, around the holidays we compromised, I gave up thanksgiving with my family to go and spend it with his so I could meet all of his family.
He agreed he would give up just Christmas Eve with his family (knowing he could spend all xmas day with his family and xmas eve is a big deal in my family) well at literally the last minute- (about the day before) he decides that his family is the priority and this no longer works for him, because it was upsetting people in his family that he wasn't going to be there. 
None of this had previously been an issue, he didn't even take into consideration that I gave up a holiday with my family to spend with his, also his family didn't take that into consideration when I had spent it with them! Also I had family in from out of state, all his family lived less than 4 hours away. 
It was totally ridiculous and I realized that if he wasn't willing to work with me on that stuff our relationship wasn't going to work in the long run. It turned into a huge fight, and it embarrassed me in front of my family. It was the beginning of the end for our relationship.

Hope everything works out for you though. "
129,"Yep. It's super common for families to like having Christmas as they always did when the children were little, and to take issue with adding in new partners, or accepting trading with other families, or anything that changes it.  

but that's what normally happens when adults grow up and start to establish their own homes, and families need to accept that.  Adults need to be adults and stand up to their parents when they try to pull this crap.  "
130,"Having just spent several hours going through an enormous toy box filled to the brim, I have to say, I like your girlfriend's style. Her son will enjoy and care for the few truly-wanted, quality toys he owns. "
131,"That is a very wise boundary to set, and you were absolutely right to hold firm to it.  It was totally warranted and not remotely awful.  

It's good for her to be hurt by this. Now she'll learn. Now that she's seen you mean it, and she'll waste her time if she doesn't follow the rule you set of giving notice (which is very very reasonable), she'll be a lot more likely to actually confirm plans.  
Had you let her visit, you'd have taught her that your boundaries mean nothing, and she can freely walk all over you. You cannot afford to do that.  

you did everything right, and now the ball's in her court to learn from the consequences of her actions.  "
132,"&gt;Random medical facts about him, he would have cried and our brother didn't. 

I think she was trying to comfort your brother while complimenting how tough he was in comparison to her boyfriend. If I were your brother, it would have boosted my ego and made me feel better about myself. "
133,"Learn a lesson, dude."
134,"I wish I had sympathy for you, but as a woman who is half a decade younger than you and still an undergrad, Im shocked you made it to a job if you can't handle your liquor like that. 

That being said, the situation sucks, and I hope you learned a lesson. I hope she doesn't tell anyone else in the circle of people she knows -- if she's the daughter of the CEO she probably knows some very powerful people. Good luck. "
135,"&gt;I'm still mad about her telling him about me

If she hadn't she would probably still be cheating on you right now"
136,You are saying he spends a lot of time at work. Sounds like the majority of the time. Who would the children be spending that time with if the father is awarded full custody?
137,"Why are you making this about her?

Just ask him in way that makes it clear that you value his friendship, and that will give him an out if he decides not to go for it. If he says no, then make a genuine effort to move on: nobody wants to be that person who sullenly resents their friend for not going out with them."
138,[removed]
139,"When we first began dating 15ish months ago she had concerns about my roommate at the time [who was a close female friend] and other close friends of mine from home who are all of the opposite sex. In fact, I have always had more female friends than male friends. This made her uncomfortable at first, but she has since outgrown the issue and realizes that's just part of who I am. 

She has made it clear she will never tell me that I cannot spend time with or be friends with a female friend, and she has held true to that promise. If she did try to tell me I wasn't allowed to see certain non-romantic friends, I would have a serious problem with that. "
140,"So glossing over the part where you seem more inclined to believe a 6 year old who was in trouble over an adult family member who was doing you a favor...

What exactly do you think your sister owes you? Every single instance of you interacting with your sister in this thread involves YOU wanting something from HER. You lived with her, you wanted babysitting and ""help"", you GOT babysitting, you want to go to her party, you want to bring your kid who is not invited. Hmmmmm...."
141,"Also, I think him talking her into getting an abortion she didn't really want and then talking to the Internet about divorcing her six months after the wedding also counts as ""emotional torture."" "
142,"I think there's a distinction that should be made between asking for the father's blessing vs his permission. You're right, permission sounds really bad, but a blessing is more like ""hey, I respect you and it would mean a lot to me of you're on board with this, but it's happening regardless.""

I didn't say anything to my father in law before I proposed. Just did it."
143,"Yeah, I was gonna say, how does this guy get through doorways with his giant, swollen balls? Good grief. I can be jealous, I get it. But pulling this over his gf having a sweetheart of a brother? It must be a burden, lugging those huge balls around..."
144,I would not get pregnant by this man again.  There's no future for a relationship without trust.  
145,"You really need a lawyer. In the us, a lot of law schools have low cost legal clinics so the students can get some practice under the supervision of licensed attorneys. See if a school near you in the phillipines has something similiar? "
146,"Hey before Jane shuts you out, can you please tell her that ""the reddit"" will send her and James $$?"
147,I guess you could prepare him to face a logjam of turds and toilet seats with fecal decorations. The only other option would be for you to personally clean the bathroom each time before he uses it.
148,"You're a strong lady, OP. You should be proud."
149,"&gt;Kissing her neck is not going to be enough foreplay for MOST women.

Yeah, this part made me laugh, but also made me deeply sad for OP's wife. It's OK that he seems to be ignorant about sex, but it's a bummer that instead of trying to learn, he's just shaming his wife for her [pretty normal] needs."
150,"Just a heads up- not telling you to go forward or not- but I know more than I'd prefer to share without doxxing-- 
When/if you report, be aware that in virtually every state your friend will be facing between 1-10 years in state prison (not jail) more so if he used an accelerant; you'll be the prosecutions key eyewitness and WILL be forced to testify against him (assuming you report and the agency files against him) and the trial may take years to conclude.  

Also, depending on your involvement? You could be charged too, as an aider and abettor (you'd have the same exposure) or as an accessory after the fact (less exposure, still a felony).  Oh. And in some jurisdictions ... this is a ""strike"" offense too... just be prepared.  And if it were my buddy posting this, I'd basically brow beat him with ""get a lawyer"" before you speak to anyone even to give a statement to protect yourself.   Hope this helps.  Fire is scary.  Arsonists suck... know what you're looking at.    People who light fires out of anger don't tend to do it only once.  

Edit: grammar"
151,"Sounds like he's checked out of the relationship, and I hardly blame him. I don't think he's a child in the context of this whole episode, his SO (OP) is a child and likes to minimise his feelings.

Frankly, if it were me, I would probably do the same until the festive season is over. And obviously dump OP."
152,"&gt; heh, he does work in a candy shop.

Ooh, advantage time!
Start keeping a tally of every time he licks you in public and tell him that for every five times he does it, he owes you a giant bag of Ghirardelli. And then don't share it with him.

...now I want Ghirardelli."
153,"You were 23 and he was 36, he wanted a younger woman he could control.  You're no longer that and the balance of power is changing.  This isn't what he wanted to happen.  What will you do about it?  No idea.

The way you post, it sounds really obvious that you outgrew him as you came into your own self.  "
154,Lol no it is not an ok excuse 
155,"Dude I'm glad you told your wife, she seems like a woman with a spine so IDK why you thought she wasn't good enough for you but whatever...  
  
To most people, there is no amount of alcohol in the world that would allow them to cheat on the spouse that they love. Do not blame alcohol for this. You did this because you wanted you. You said fuck you to your wife and son. But hey now that your son will most likely be living with your ex you can bring home all the coworkers you want to bang at your place!!!"
156,"Not to mention, in the Friends version of his story, Ross actually gets the opportunity to follow through on it with Isabella Rossalini and it still doesn't happen.  

Because just wanting to fuck a celebrity is no guarantee that they want to fuck you."
157,"Yeah I usually have a hawks eye for abusive red flags, but shouting and losing your temper one time isn't one. 

The fiancé is childishly overreacting here. Moving to her moms because he yelled and threw some clothes around? And shutting him down by trying to play the ""you're scaring me"" card is pretty low.

I think OP should still apologize for yelling. But the fact that she's already dragging his name through the mud to her family is FAR worse in my opinion."
158,"Maybe since you guys are on the same page with this pretty um... unconventional idea here, you have more in common than you've realized. Perhaps this will turn into a bromantic comedy where you guys end up as bff's. "
159,"No, no I'm not.  I'm not saying she *isn't* in the US.  I'm saying she *might not* be (and she is, as she posted elsewhere in this thread), and that one should not assume.


I live in the US (and was born in the US) and English is not my first language, so it would be rather contradictory of me to assume something like that, don't you think?"
160,"I mean, even Wikipedia has a list and links to the law by state...it isn't hard for her to check the law without calling the police. "
161,You need a better boyfriend.
162,"Yea he is being a bit on a shit contacting her out of the blue and dumping this on her. He seems like he's playing a really crule game. He never spoke to her and now is inviting her to ""join his family"". Why does he care now when 20 years went by with out so much as a happy birthday kid. "
163,You need to remind yourself that you are young. Quit looking 5 steps ahead and refocus your gaze to just barely past your nose. Your girlfriend is being quite sensible here and you should appreciate her for being stable throughout your relationship. Take things one step at  time. Not all relationships last forever and sometimes the end but just live in the here and now.
164,"Yep, I'm neither white nor Christian."
165,"Depends on their skin and how they scar, along with how long it stays in for. If she takes it out soon it should be super minimal scarring. At most it should be like an acne scar."

They are asses. You are a champ. And certainly far from a baby."
169,"I'm so happy that your SO recognized that it was a problem and sought help! 

It was the hardest/most heartwrenching thing to walk away because I felt like I was giving up but he had ruined two important events for me with drinking and I just wondered how many more events would be spent worrying the entire time about his drinking...

OP and her boyfriend are younger than me and my ex were and I think there is a lot more tolerance for alcohol abuse when you are younger. Give it 5 years and most of their friends will be getting married/having intimate parties where his behavior won't be tolerated anymore. "
170,"Scenarios like the OP are the exact reason people like you have shitty attitudes. Blame your parents, not women. Use some damn common sense. Or perhaps seek out some therapy.   "

174,"You can always tell someone was never actually good at something they love when they want to live vicariously through their kids like this.

Your dad is a narcissist. I know it hurts now to feel unloved but him not talking to you could be a good thing as you won't have to be raised by and pick up habits by learning things from a terrible person.
"
175,"I promise you, that will change."
176,"I would agree with this poster. It seems like he feels like he didn't sign up for this, and is having a hard time being caught between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, he probably feels like he should do the right thing (like come get you when you're in trouble), and on the other, he doesn't want to accept this burden. I don't think it's going to work out. It looks like he had some issues with that old ex of his, and he's disappointed that this thing with you is causing a lot of trouble for him. It's not your fault that this is happening, but maybe it's best you guys both move on. You can either solve the problem on your own, or find someone who's willing and strong enough to support you through it. But he ain't it girl."
177,"Have you considered offering a compromise to your mother?

Perhaps instead of her coming down each week, she could come down every other week and use the saved money to hire a sitter for those few hours? Or at least one visit a month where there's a sitter and no girls intruding on your time together. 

It sounds like these poor girls and your mom are in a tough situation and trying to make the best of it. Just explain how having less but greater quality time with your mother would mean more than sharing that time with the girls. "
178,"Just keep in mind - this doesn't make him an utterly shitty person. He's just someone who couldn't bring himself to be honest, with you or with himself, for 5 years. So yeah, flowers are nice, worth a ""thanks, they're really pretty - but this doesn't make us more compatible."""
179,"Timeline, correct me if I'm wrong:

You brought him to your former home. Spent roughly 5 weeks adjusting to his new life with his new family in his new home before being uprooted to yet another new home. (You claim you've had him for 8 weeks and that you've been living in your current house for 3 weeks.)

I am not a vet or a trainer but in my experience with rescues, I think it's safe to assume that maybe a lot of his behaviours are a reaction to all of the changes happening around him. Rescues tend to get nervous and anxious fairly easily, especially when things keep changing around them. In turn, some dogs get nervous and urinate unexpectedly. Some dogs mark. Some dogs are perfectly accepting of it all and do nothing.

With a bit more time to settle, some of his behaviours may disappear on their own but I will always recommend seeking a trainer that can work with you and your dog on finding a balance. Correcting the behaviours and using positive reinforcement to encourage good behaviour works wonders.

In the end, I think you and your fiancé need to have a good long chat and sort out what is going to be the best option for the dog. If you can't find a compromise you'll end up putting a huge strain on your relationship and the dog will suffer because of it. Not to mention you have two very different points of view on how to handle a difficult situation and that's a giant red flag in my books.

I hope you two figure things out and do what's best for yourselves AND the dog."
180,"So Jane has James, and Amy can go kick rocks. Problem solved. 

Also, Amy is a worthless family betraying piece of shit. Too bad you can't play neutral in a situation like this."
181,"How about you ask the mother if there are other ways you can get to spend some quality time with your nephew? 

Like someone else suggested, you could also do sleepovers at her house while she's gone somewhere else. 

Don't even bother to mount some kind of defense about how his allergy is just an ""allergy"" and that you think she's just being a lying liar - that's a *great* way to guarantee that a sleepover at your house will *never* happen. "
182,"You want him to act on things how, exactly? You *should* accept the way things are right now because they *are* a consequence of your decisions (yours and his). You made the decision to break things off. He believed you when you said that's what you want. He is respecting your wishes. 

He *doesn't* owe you anything. He didn't owe you anything the minute you broke up with him. Don't pat yourself on the back too much for having a drawn-out 3 day breakup rather than ghosting, the outcome has been roughly the same. If anything the drawn out nature of your breakup was probably more damaging in the long run. 

Are you mad at him for listening to you? Of course he went with it. He thinks you don't want to be with him. Why else would you dump him? But now you want him to fight for you?

For someone who appears to take great pride in their rationality and says they don't believe in rom-com movie shit, you sure seem to expect him to be the male protagonist in your life who'll ""fight for the girl"". Your behavior is confounding. Google ""avoidant attachment"", you might identify with some or all of that description and learn more about yourself and what kinds of partners to pick.

Lastly, you should stop talking to him to enable both of you to move on. What you're doing now isn't healthy."
183,"That's great that your husband espouses those ideals, but when someone's words contradict their actions, believe their actions. He can call himself a supportive feminist till the cows come home, but if he's colluding with your boss to keep your paycheck, that means zilch."
184,It's common Irish slang for Brazen. See also 'she has some neck' and 'the brass neck on her'.
185,There's probably a damn good reason the kid isn't living with the parents. Given how OP's whole family seems to be taking the boyfriend's side after he *physically attacked* her brother... I'm guessing there's far more to the story.
186,"Do you guys have an actual Planned Parenthood near-ish to you? They are usually sliding income scale and can help direct you to affordable resources. I had to get an abortion at 15 and they were the miracle I needed to get it done. 

Be careful which clinics you go to. As horrible as it sounds, there are fake clinics that exist only to guilt a woman out of an abortion. They provide no real service. They look real but then bring out everything they can to guilt someone into changing their minds. I don't want either of you to have to go through anything like that. An actual Planned Parenthood is way more trust worthy and affordable. "
187," I think that spending NYE alone might just be a better time than something like that. Are there fireworks or other public celebrations you could go to? Perhaps a club? You could invite some people you know to go with you - that way you are the one doing the inviting. You could say that it seemed more fun, or that you don't feel like a houseparty. Are there any expat clubs in your area? It looks like it just might be better to take matters into your own hands instead of going to a shitty party you got a pity-invite to. "
188,"Personally I would drop that person as a hot potato as well.

When I start to date someone on a regular basis (once a week or more) I assume that we're exclusive.

Some feel you have to have the talk before, some doesn't. It is up to you though."
189,I agree. This sounds like something I would tell particular friends if they wanted to bring a guest I didn't know. Friends that would understand that of course their guest is welcome in my home and that I'm just being silly. I think the top comment has a very well thought out reply and then it can be up to the friend to explain the message if they wish. 
190,"Keep in contact with your mother, but cut the rest off. Screw those people. Tell your mother that she can always stay with you (if that's possible). 

I would not give your brother a cent any more. In fact, I wouldn't talk to him at all. "
191,"Not to mention we don't know how many ""chances"" this professor has had. If OP stands up to him and he backs off, who is to say that he won't target another student who will be less secure and let it happen because she's afraid for her grades? Who is to say this is the first time he's done this at all?

/u/justnoprofessor , I went through a similar experience at my job. A coworker aggressively tried to kiss me in our walk-in freezer. It made me feel uncomfortable and unsafe, but  I didn't want to speak up because I was afraid I would get him fired. A couple of months later, he did the same thing to another, younger teenager working at the restaurant. I felt horribly that I didn't speak up.

If he loses his job or marriage, *you didn't destroy either of those things.* Your professor did that all by himself. You don't know what he'll do after you, but it only takes one brave person to speak up and end the cycle. I really strongly encourage you to speak to your Title 9 officer."
192,"It kind of sounds exactly like your parents and sister describe it to be honest. You chose to break up with your girlfriend RIGHT as you became wealthy, and a MONTH LATER you have a much more attractive and younger GIRLFRIEND. Come on, dude. "
193,"There's no ""borderline"" about this.  It's sexual harassment.  Does your office have an HR department?  Those should be the folks you go to for help handling this situation.  If you're willing to put up with harassment to avoid inconveniencing your boss, you really need to reassess your priorities.  Office politics can be difficult, and coworkers can be assholes, but if you don't stand up for yourself it won't stop, and it will likely get worse over time."
194,My parents have been married for 36 years. My mom has been at least 30 minutes late for everything during that period. If you find out how to cure it please let my father know.
195,"&gt; I walk into the room, find him... exposed and on the screen is 2 men going at it basically and I said ""what are you doing"" and he pulled his trousers up and said sorry then went into another room.

This sounds like a normal reaction to being caught watching porn.

Later, when you talked to him, you were emotional, crying, and told him to leave. You didn't give him a chance to talk, so I don't understand where he was supposed to explain himself. You didn't specify if you considered his actions cheating, why you were so upset, or anything. All he got was a crying, accusing wife who told him to get out of the house. So he got out of the house like you told him to. 
"
196,"Can I ask, why are you so invested in staying with this guy? You are spending so much of your energy trying to save/manage a relationship that you describe as emotional ""torture"". What about this relationship could *possibly* make him worth it? "
197,"&gt;Frankly speaking had I found out she slept with 15 guys when we were dating, I wouldn't have continued dating her. 

Why does that matter? What happens if you date another 12 girls who are all like this... now you are up to 15. Should girls not date you anymore?"
198,But he still gets to decide that isn't for him.  
199,I talked to her a bit ago and she agreed to see a doctor about it. I think me refusing to partake in the argument and just walking away helped her take a step back and view the situation from another angle...seeing a specialist is a big step and I'm hoping this helps quite a bit. 
200,Seriously?!?!! I love company too but I would not love 6 people (total) including a toddler and newborn in a 1b apartment! Being okay with that is definitely not the norm. 
201,"Grief at your age is *hard*. There are so many emotions to make sense of. I agree that if her school as counseling/grief resources to look into it.  The school may also have knowledge of community resources like bereavement camp or group therapy sessions. 

I used to intern at an organization that funded camps called Camp Erin around the US which were for children and teens who had lost someone close to them. I would suggest looking into it for your area and even if they aren't until summertime. They're free and are a wonderful experience for teens and kids experiencing grief. "
202,"If you've been abused and in an abusive relationship previously, that's not your fault, and it does not reflect badly on you in anyway. You don't need to be ashamed or embarrassed about that, especially with your partner. He's saying these things because he cares about you and loves you. "
203,You're not married and have no kids.  Remember that.
204,"&gt; I really don't think I love him less

As I said before, he loves you so much more than you love him that you can't even comprehend how much more that is. Your post right  here is exactly that. You do realize that in everything you've written you've shown no more fondness than a person and their pet?"
205,"I did! I will consider using this. UGH, it's just so uncomfortable."
206,"You're enabling him. He may not recover without you but he absolutely will not recover with you. Even if you stopped enabling him, you're worried about him becoming a criminal to support his habit. That indicates he's out of control to the point where you can't help him.

It's time to leave. "
207,I laughed at your username in light of this post subject
208,"Which is ironic, as this is reddit, and I'm waiting for the guy who always chimes in when somebody categorizes a person who pervs on tweens and teens as a ""pedophile"" and not whatever the technical term is for that kind of Chester. "
209,"I'm really curious as to what he's warning her other men are like. Because short of abuse, I'm hard-pressed to think of how a man could be worse than repeatedly cheating on you and then blaming you for it. "
210,"His dad is fine for the most part, but his mother has never really accepted me. She's nice enough in front of my fiance or to my face, but there are a lot of passive-aggressive comments she makes. For a long time I thought I was just being sensitive, but a few of my friends noticed it as well. "
211,"I hope she misses me. She definitely talks about wanting to come back here since I'm here and her entire family is here. Unfortunately she works for one of those forbes top 5 happiest companies to work for so she technically could have a similar job here but not with one of these cool new age companies...

I also work in a completely different industry and unfortunately can't work remotely at all unless I took some sort of sales job but that isn't really anything I'm interested in. The only other option in my head currently is to move back and go back to school (something I want to do either way) and then eventually we both try to find a place where we can both have good careers with great companies. I think there is potential for that. 

I think she could work from home at her company but again it isn't really in something she'd enjoy doing. The big thing about her job is being at work because it's one of those fun companies where they work half the time and then have fun the other half. So if she worked remotely then it wouldn't be the same. 

Realistically I don't want to leave this company because it's growing so fast and I feel like there is a lot of potential to grow with it. I guess I would be ok with leaving but only after I've had some time under my belt for the experience which would look great on my resume. 2 months of work isn't anything...

213,"My point is not whether you *are* low-maintenance. The thing you should focus on is that literally EVERY example you gave in your original post is an example of not having the ability to stand up for yourself. I can't tell you if you're overreacting or not, but you're constantly in turmoil about this. Have you considered talking to a therapist? You could share specifics and get to the bottom of what your issue is.


And you should really stop with the being ""eternally this"" or ""eternally that"" thing... it's literally a mental shtick you repeat to yourself in order to justify the fact that you ""eternally"" have no backbone. There's a difference between not taking a joke and letting people treat you like shit. You think women like that? Also, you're concentrating WAY too hard on the girl aspect. You have a LOT of ground to cover before you even think about how you're appearing to the women around you. That's just going to cloud the issue."
214,"You described you and your GF as tech enthusiasts.  Would  it be fair to describe her as anything resembling a tech snob?  It almost sounds like she's pissy you got a cool, flagship big-brand phone instead of one of the ""cool new indie"" phone.  That doesn't justify her reaction, which is super petty.   She sounds like the type of person who shops at whole foods or a farmers market and gets mad when her SO buys something at Wal-Mart.  "
215,"Yup. Thinking about that guy in grad school wondering about dating and 18 year old freshman. There's a certain type of guy who looks for a much younger woman for some sort of validation, whether it's a conscious thing or not. And a lot of times you get this sort of child-wife dynamic (I'm thinking of the play A Doll's House by Ibsen). I don't blame the naive 20-something for being blown away by this suave, seemingly mature older man. But 10 years later when you've grown up and being an adult in your own right means denying him the validation he was attracted to you for, it can make things hard on both sides. 

I don't think it always happens and I don't think it's impossible for the relationship to mature and survive, but there will definitely be some growing pains. "
216,"Your brother is a first class jackass. Remind him that HE is the one who threw Martin away and only wants to be around now that he's made something of himself; he doesn't get to claim credit for being a great father when he wasn't. If he continues making a stink about it, ask him-infront of the extended family so they can all witness his douchebaggery- where he was when Martin needed him. Suggested phrases include: ""Were you supporting him when he needed it? I clearly remember you calling him a waste of time; does that sound like a good father to you?"" He doesn't give a rat's ass about Martin, he wants food for his ego (he's desperate for people to compliment what a swell father he must have been to raise such a successful child) and to take everything that Martin has built for himself. He's not a father, he's a narcissistic ass-wipe who needs to put on his big boy undies and accept the consequences of his actions."
217,I hope she had enough self-respect to break up with you. 
218,"You shouldn't live with your brother. He's not a safe person. What happened was upsetting, sure, but it doesn't justify strangling anyone. And now you know he's a person who strangles his sisters when they upset him. Not a good bet.

You're right that your parents are being unfair to you. You could try not responding to them at all until they start talking about something else. It's a little childish, but your tools are limited."
219,"those are usually on commission, you'd have to be nuts to invest in materials and time to that extent without a buyer lined up "
220,Duuude. This is your fucking marriage. You pledged your life to this woman. You're not even going to make an effort to work things out?
221,"Yes. We're talking about religious people though. You know, the people who believe that there are different planes of existence, some of which contain all of your relatives that died and is governed by a man with a beard who likes to do magic stuff that for some reason nobody can actually prove is real. 

Not the most logical bunch. "
222,"No man... She went off after we talked about it, and I agreed to try earlier than I personally had planned."
223,"Agreed. The best OP will ever get is being considered ""one of the good ones"""
224,"That's a really disconcerting outlet for a self-esteem issue. What if he stops getting a boost from matches in general? What if he comes across a particular match that he wants to pursue? IMO this is an unhealthy way of dealing with a low self-esteem and it involves so much risk and temptation in general - even if he did not intend to cheat, genuinely, this behavior would still disturb me and I would still be asking it to stop. If he wants to boost himself, maybe he should talk to someone about his problems. "
225,"She makes 29k. If she loves that job and settles down locally with someone who makes 50k, that is enough to settle down in a lot of small towns. She doesn't need future prospects if that is what she wants.

228,"Speak to your Dad and see if it's possible to have a Guardian ad Litem appointed for you and your brother. This attorney would represent your interests in modifying visitation. 

Also, seeing a therapist weekly will help to document the problems that occur with visitation at your Mom's, and is often used in such types of determinations."
229,"Yup. Or knowing himself and the fact that he is apparently an extraordinarily picky and unadventurous eater, he should have had some back up food on hand. Which he actually did, so what the hell his problem was, I don't know."
230,I would just pay the money in this case. Your office is small enough that he would probably find out and not paying might possibly worsen your situation.
231,"Yea, this is my opinion, but if you were a friend of mine I absolutely would not be okay with you being treated like this without your fiancé laying down the law.
Neither my, nor my SO's family, would dream of doing this to an SO - especially one that's been officially committed to with marriage.
No-No. If my family had done this, I would not be going there at all."

234,"Please don't send this.   She isn't going to be impressed with your praise for her radiance, succulent curves and long cascading hair, she's going to be terrified.    She will NOT want to get to know you better, or be impressed with your statements about your sobriety and your other superior qualities.

Personally I wouldn't go out with someone who didn't ask me out in person, although you could try a text message, as long as you leave out the gushing about her beauty.   That's something to keep for when you ARE in a relationship."
235,"&gt; That you misled her?

Yes.

&gt; that you are a weak negotiator?

Yes.

&gt;  that they stiffed you?

Yes. 

&gt;What exactly is she angry about?

All of the above, and more, I'm sure. 


&gt; Frankly she should be doing a dance of joy.

My unemployment was long and brutal. I was looking for a job earning 1/2 of what I'm currently making, so it's such a nominal thing, all things considered. But, it's going to be WWIII. "
236,"&gt; should have become a plumber instead of saving babies

Actually laughed out loud at that."
237,"I'm the same way, walking past a Lush shop is enough to give me a headache. Even though she is grieving, you need to tell her. Very gently. People telling you to stick it out might not understand how bad it is. If she loves you and cares about you she won't want to do anything that might hurt you, even though she is grieving. I can only imagine that if it was me, I'd be upset my SO hadn't told me sooner that I was hurting him."
238,"OP'S GIRLFRIEND, YA CRAZY GIRL."
239,"&gt;""It feels like you're looking for things to fight about. I don't have a strategy to fix the text message because there's nothing to fix with it. I was driving, I was typing quick because I wanted to catch you before you went to sleep. I can't be expected to be full of exclamation points and drawings and happiness at all times, asking me to is not fair.""

This seems like good communication on her part.  

It is important to communicate your feelings, which you did, and that's good.  But it's also fair for her to say that you feel the way you do about it because you're failing to give her the benefit of the doubt and assuming the worst, which you did.  It's not fair to expect her to frame all of her communication around the expectation that you will assume the worst in anything she says.

&gt;I just wanted to discuss my feelings and see if we could have handled the situation differently. From my perspective, the word ""driving"" would have been plenty so that I would have known she was too busy to talk to me.

It seems like you're focused on what she could do differently, when really this wasn't a result of her actions - she said goodnight and that she loves you which is the most she could do given the circumstances of her driving.  You feel the way you do because you assumed the worst when you saw her message, which can be pretty easily fixed if you give your girlfriend the benefit of the doubt (something to which she's entitled if she's otherwise trustworthy)."
240,"*He kidnapped your child.* For several hours. 

What will he do to her next time to get what he wants?"
241,"You reported something that was scary enough at the time for you to make a complaint.  As a result, this man assaulted a police officer.  Which no person who is just out for shit and giggles with an axe does.  Give your head a shake and do the right thing.  This guy is unstable and certainly won't get help on the street.  If he can't get help for himself maybe the courts will make him get help.  "
242,"Attention != compliments, although they can be great. Also not all compliments are created equal: those that say somethings about the person are more powerful and you can usually tell the compliments that require more thought and sincerity. Example: ""that's a neat shirt"" vs ""you really have a great fashion sense"" or something. 

But anyways, remember: it's attention she ultimately wants, which is a form of emotional validation. One suggestion I have is to look up what that means whether you already know or not, and reflect on how that can be increased in your relationship. "
243,"He needs to go therapy. PTSD is not something that can go untreated.  It's good he has a therapy dog, but he needs to start dealing with what is going on inside him. 

Have you told him that he throws punches in his sleep? To him, it's just nightmare. He may not be aware of the external violence of it. "
244,"Pretty sure your Mom isn't borderline.  Go over to /r/raisedbynarcissists and read up on some coping strategies.  Mind you, they're pretty hard core 'go no contact', and that may or may not be a good option for you.  There are other strategies, though, and good resources there."
245,"The thing is, it sounds like she has dementia and/or another mental health condition. As a nurse I can provide a little insight to your situation.

People who don't want to ""ship of dear old mum"" off to ""one of those horrible nursing homes"" don't realise that if you're a carer in ""one of those horrible nursing homes"" then you're professionally trained in dealing with dementia/mental health and manual handling. 

Not only that, the carer is on an 8 hour shift. They get to go home at the end of the day. If you have a person who has mental health issues, mobility issues and who has chronic health conditions so severe they are no longer able to take care of themselves then your dad and the entire family will burn them selves out very, very quickly.

Not only are you not qualified to be full time carers, you never get to ""knock off"" Three o'clock in the morning when she needs help going to the bathroom someone will have to help her. two in the afternoon when she starts yelling about how she hates it here and how no one helps her, someone will have to calm her down. Someone will have to be there at all times in case she has a fall or gets stuck or hurts herself or even absconds.


It's literally not possible for you to provide the care she needs. Not only do carers have adequate training and can leave at the end of the shift, they also have the support of office staff, admin, nurses and doctors to help co-ordinate and provide care to their patients.

She's not a regular patient- busted leg, get it healed, go home. She will deteriorate. Her moods and memory will get worse, her mobility and health will decline. If you're finding it hard to deal with before she's even there, it's only going to get worse when she's actually there and as she declines."

What protein is in meat that you can't get from plants? 

How much protein do you need everyday? How much protein do you get per serving of various meats? Plants? "
248,"No, this is what you were downvoted for. 

&gt;When we have awkward moments of people making jokes about meat, we chime in and say, ""Yes, but in OUR family, we take care of animals, we don't eat them, right?"" And that has worked for us so far.

The kind of smarmy, self-congratulatory attitude vegetarians are famous for. "
249,"I agree.

I'm a 22 year old woman who lives at home. I'm going off to grad school next year so with this gap year I'm staying at home. If I even go out to dinner with one of my friends, I let them know so they know I'm not dead in a ditch. I tell my parents what I'm up to. It's going to sound rude but I never ask permission. Of course, if my parents tell me that they have plans so it'd be better if I stayed home or helped with them, I would listen, because they aren't telling me no straight up. My boyfriend who is 21 lives away at school in another state, so when he goes home and wants to do something, the only reason he asks for permission is because he would have to use one of their cars.

I understand it's their house, their rules, but why ask for permission? What? It's not like he's having you over for four days. You two are going out of the country. Was there something else going on where his parents would want him to stay home? Is it over one of their birthdays or a family event?"
250,"Yep, she has to learn the hard way. She's never going to change if she never has to deal with any consequences for her actions. I had a similar situation with a cousin. He would party all night and forget about everything. Appointments, flights, court dates, you name it and he's missed it. My Aunt would pay for all his flights and then new ones once he missed those. He didn't have to deal with consequences because someone always took care if it for him. He didn't even begin to change until my aunt start putting her foot down, YOU missed your flight now YOU have to figure it out. "

252,"Definitely told my bestie the first night we met that I rather liked him, and I thought I might just keep him. Admittedly he's gay and im a woman so not really the same, but some weirdoes with limited social skills do say weird crap like that.

Edit - to be clear, I don't think op's gf is a weirdo like me, though. I am equally suspicious."
253,"I would definitely do what the other suggested. I think the best thing you can do is to do some of this research for her, help her set it up, be a part of the process so that she doesn't feel like she's going through this alone. "
254,"I mean is a 24 year old hooking up with a high school girl ""life""? "
255,Your school might also have short term loans available for students. My university had an option of a no interest loan of 300 or less through the student union that would be taken out of the next semesters bill. They didn't ask any questions about what you needed it for either.
256,"I think it's pretty reasonable to limit what the kids get from Santa - he's not suggesting you don't get the kids the presents, just that you don't label them from Santa. We used to spend Christmas with our cousins - our parents were better off and there were two of us to three of them - so the stockings were matched, and the parents would get duplicates of small age group stuff, so if I got something really great for a five year old, my parents would get a similar one for my cousin and vice-versa. It meant there were never any questions about why some of us got more from Santa than the others. I think it's fair that ""seeing other kids get more or different things to you at Xmas is a life lesson they should be teaching their kids"" - but they aren't saying, 'don't get little Sally that doll because Grace wants one but we can't afford it', they are just asking if you can reduce the difference between the stockings."

258,"If you want him to give you a chance: STOP MAKING EXCUSES. It doesn't matter what you ""thought"", he deserved to know what he was walking into. And then you wouldn't even defend him until after he left? If it were me, I'd have dumped you on my way out the door. And being ""non-confrontational"" is not a valid reason to be a bad girlfriend."
259,"You have been abused for years, and that is all you know about relationships. I think you are just expressing the deep resentment you have for having been treated (and still being treated) like an animal for years - now that he is depressed, you use it as a means to strike back at him and express your frustration.


I don't know where on earth you get the idea he is trying to change when he has spat in your face. You can't leave because you don't know any better than this, and you are afraid of being on your own.


Make no mistake, this is beyond recovery. And it is interesting that you are afraid of speaking up and getting him in trouble with the law: you know, it means he is doing things bad enough to lock him up and yet you can't see that.

I know you're seeing your mom's love for you and all the effort she's been putting in. All we can see from here is the impact of her actions - that you can't work, that you're stuck in the house, that you don't have the social security and education documents you need to fix those things. No one's saying your mom is a bad person who's hurting you on purpose, but she doesn't NEED to be cruel or have bad intentions to have contributed to a bad situation. And that's why you need to be a little selfish right now. "
261,It might be more cost effective to have an escort on retainer.  
262,"Am I missing something? Her dad is a PASTRY chef. He makes good pastries, not good French cuisine. Your gf isn't even snobby, she's just being ridiculous."
263,"He doesn't have to actively think 'im goung to do this abusive thing', he may genuinely believe he's doing something in earnest BUT lets leave no doubt on this issue: his actions are abusive and it is intolerable. "
264,"&gt; my girlfriend it's obsessed with not hurting people, so she lies and I've seen her do it with friends, family and me

Nope, that's not why she lies.  She lies because she doesn't want to feel the discomfort of the consequences of her actions.  No-one lies to ""not hurt someone"", it's almost always for selfish reasons.

She KNOWS lying hurts you, she doesn't care.  She has ALREADY cheated on you with this guy, and now she's planning to meet up with him again and lying to you about it.

She is not trustworthy and she is likely going to cheat on you again.

Why do you want to be with someone who has zero respect for you and acts so selfishly?"
265,She could also be Australian as we use  British English and the dollar
266,"It's not something people really think about unless they've moved before as an adult with expenses or unless they're going to somewhere like NYC or San Francisco. 

I noticed that OP also didn't address whether his girlfriend even wants to open her own business, so I'm hoping that's something being considered. 

Edit: a word. "
267,You can't save him from himself. 
268,"Yeah I know, but the joke is just fun."
269,"This is a really well considered comment, and I certainly identified with it. Depression is a brutal disease. The question really is how the husband acted BEFORE the current financial problems. Is this behavior new and unusual, or is it just more of the same? This should probably determine OP's approach. "
270,"I'm no expert but I feel like surely it is a huge jump from destroying objects to self harm?! 

Regardless, he should still absolutely tell the father and get her mental health treatment because either way she needs it."
271,"&gt; Was she even aware that the OP was home and needed help or was she under the impression he was still at work?

This was my thought as well. Why is she getting crap for not being there when she had no reason to believe he was home and needed gas? Okay, granted she's probably aware of his work schedule, but for all she knew he was sitting in his boxers inside playing video games or drinking hot chocolate so she decided to go see her mom. If OP never contacted her saying ""Hey when are you coming home today? I started clearing the driveway and ran out of gas for the snowblower, can you pick some up on the way home?"" then it's not on her to read his mind.

Edit: heard that OP did contact her so never mind on my point here! "
272,"So... had an affair, huh?"
273,That means he's controlling all of her money.
274,Age of Ultron is rated PG-13. Stop showing PG-13 movies to your 4-year-old brother without your parents' permission. Treat it as a lesson learned.
275,"No, my god I want her to be the Guardian. He asked if I knew of a more stable home and I thought I did. Jane is my second choice. 

"
276,"Uh, yeah, they're allowed. This person is saying that although they are allowed to sleep with whomever, they can't expect that there will be no consequences. Good job cherry picking though. 

You want to be on good terms with your ex wife? Then don't fuck her ex bff. It looks like you've been lusting over her the whole time, which won't sit well, regardless of whether you and your wife are together or separated. It will breed resentment whether that makes sense or not in your perfect logical world.

Want to fuck the ex bff? Then don't expect to have a good relationship with your ex wife. You can't have your cake and eat it. 

Choose one or the other, and live with the consequences. That's it. 

Yeah, he's allowed. But that's not the point.        "
277,"Um...no? She's Catholic. What? 

Anyway believe in lizard people all you want I guess but if the only qualification you need to not be scary is to not have literally killed someone then I don't know what to tell you. Send him a friendly message if you want but I would also look into other groups away from conspiracy and possibly look into some therapy to help you gain some confidence to start dating at 32. "
278,"You're most likely right, but I believe in giving people the benefit of the doubt. Still, it's usually really easy to tell when your FWB wants more, and that's when I end it if I am not interested. 

Honestly, it's his narcissism disguised as horniness which resulted in him leading this poor girl on. I just don't understand how someone could use another person like that. 

Still, I reiterate that we're all making assumptions here...but it's pretty likely that our assumptions are correct. "
279,"If I'm being auditioned for a relationship then I want to be the only one on the table. If I lose I want it to be because I suck, not because someone else was better."
280,"There is nothing common etiquette about finding a surrogate date with a coworker when your bf can't make it to the party.

""Sorry my bf couldn't make it"". it's not like these people were exactly strangers"
281,"I agree. I can understand being introverted and not enjoying social situations, but not greeting people and not making a tiny effort to make small talk with the husband's family &amp; friends and ask them how they are? It's rude. Those are basic social skills, there is no excuse imho. OP could leave her at home 90% of the time but for obligate social events like Christmas and birthdays, she needs to learn that she cannot just sit around on her phone and show zero interest."
282,"Because if I want to check out attractive people, there are models or instagrams or gonewild content that is readily available. It's like looking at the casual encounters section in craigslist, but locally - maybe it satisfies a kink or something, but it's pretty damn questionable. Using a service that you are easily connected to and can easily connect to others is even more suspicious.  This isn't about how guys are - it's about what certain behavior suggests."
283,"Did any part of this set off any bells in your head about your role?  Because you seem awfully blase about your only semi-decent child telling you that you're an impatient, selfish fuck.  

She hates you, and she's tired of dealing with you and your awful daughter Amy.  The very thought of that should have you in tears.  "
284,"Ok, sorry I obviously got everyone's names confused badly so parts of the story sounded a lot worse to me than they actually are when I reread it. And I thought you meant Colin was telling Mike about the meeting for no reason. I didn't realise he was the one who told Mike he couldn't say. Ok that all makes sense now and I can understand why you would be frustrated. 

But just like you're allowed to feel frustrated, your girlfriend doesn't have to agree with you. Yelling and screaming at her when the whole situation wasn't her fault was still a terrible thing to do. 

And Mike is also allowed to be frustrated and block you, however talking about you to your friends is immature and quite pathetic. But I think what you failed to do was realise that your gf and Mike are two separate people. She isn't responsible for his actions. "
285,"I taught at a CC, and some of my better students were high school kids.  Took it more seriously than a lot of the people who had actually graduated already."
286,"I mean, my Korean mother is also in a big damn hurry for me to marry. (29) I'm Korean American and I brought home my boyfriend of two months and my parents said, ok, get married now. TWO MONTH RELATIONSHIP. I mean, I was appalled.

Did I ask how high to jump when they said jump? No. I told my parents that we would get married if and when we wanted to do so, that marriage was on the table as a possibility but we certainly weren't going to get engaged right then. They could cry and scream at us a lot or just live with it. They chose the latter. 

So while I think it's juuust common enough to call ""normal"", I also think that no one will die if a marriage is not performed that soon. And OP's mom, who is also Korean, understands that. There's a balance between stringing someone along and rushing into marriage."
287,"&gt; Tell me, if you've been treated the same, would you not feel your partner was being dismissive of your feelings or their import?

I'm sure I would.

I'm equally sure that I'd be an adult about it by either suggesting marital counseling, or making it clear that a sexless relationship is a deal-breaker for me, not unilaterally deciding to never engage in sex or intimacy again without giving my partner a heads up about it.

You're choosing not to communicate your decision to your wife. What's the payoff to you there?"
288,"It's considered really rude if the partner is not also good friends with the housemate.  If the housemate consents and wants that person around, nbd. It's not something to be presumptuous about and not something to initiate without knowing 100%that your housemate wants it.  It's especially unacceptable that she just gives him the keys. "
289,"My SO's number is 14. Mine is 1. I was a tiny bit insecure when I first found out, but I handled it in much the same way as your SO did. I knew it was bullshit and I let it go pretty quickly. People should not be judged for having feelings, but they should be held accountable for how those feelings are handled. OP's boyfriend is handling his feelings like shit. He brings it up once every ***three days minimum?*** Why is he so obsessed? Huge red flag. "
290,"Let me guess. You are married, and your wife stays at home to raise the kids,  while you earn the income for the family. And you insist on tracking your wife's every move - ""You said you were at the store, but the app said you also stopped at Starbucks, too. Why were you at Starbucks? Who were you meeting there? Why were you hiding it from me? You're cheating on me! Prove you aren't!"" And when your wife says she is tired of you tracking her every move, and reading through her phone every day,  and using keyloggers on her computer, you yell ""I pay the bills! That's MY phone you're using! That's MY computer you use, in the house I pay for! Show some gratitude! I pay the bills, therefore you have NO rights, NO privacy, and you CAN'T complain!"" 
 
That is, of course, a dramatization, but it is your exact attitude and mindset. It is abusive and incorrect."
291,"Her big fear is that we will never move and that if we have kids, she will be stuck driving hours a day and never see them. I know that we are only talking about a about moving about 20 miles east, but it still feels like I am taking all of the risk both emotionally and financially."
292,[deleted]
293,"I guess it just depends if this is a dealbreaker for you. For many, a little teasing on clothing and being cheap isn't a big issue if it's all light-hearted. If you feel like she's intending to hurt you, it may be sign of a bigger issue. You need to decide what's more important - your girlfriend or not being teased by an SO?"
294,"Partners trying to salvage situations like this usually end up hurt, missing or dead. Food for thought."
295,"It's not that people here ""find it weird."" It's that it is blatantly obvious to literally any observer that OP and Holly have a thing for each other. The way I see it, Jane is basically pointing out how strange it is to take their statements at face value, with the goal of having OP and Holly admit that they do indeed have a thing for each other. And yeah it is true that she isn't being particularly tactful about it, but come on, you have to admit she has a point, and there's no way their other friends aren't thinking it too if they seriously *go to bed together* in group social settings. So claiming that Jane should grow up and not make a big deal about it really doesn't solve anything here. "
296,You're parents are legally required to provide you with food and shelter until you are 18. Call the police.
297,"hence the 18 suggestion, less amo. "
298,Is no need for obfuscation. Those two issues are separate things. It's unhelpful to pull in other issues while trying to sort out another. 
299,"Man, it wasn't you bringing in her kids. It was you hitting on her at a professional event. Then continuing to hit on her after she rebuffed you. Then you doubled down by being a complete jerkass (with a good - maybe unintentional - side of homophobia. Your words implied that being gay/lesbian sounds bizarre to be associated with being a parent. You also pulled that old cringe-worthy ""only ugly women are lesbians (because no man wants them)"" trope that's been around for ages.). In one stupid sentence, you invalidated: Her, Her Family, Her Relationship, Her Sexual Identity, Her Spouse.

For the record, what you said should not have come out of your mouth to *anyone, anywhere, drunk or sober*. It is a douchebag thing to say to someone. You were just dumb/unlucky enough to finally say it to someone that had the power to provide some very immediate and serious consequences for it. "
300,"I think she posted in response to something else that he's punctual for everything he wants to do. 

If not , that kind of makes sense. Im punctual for work, uni and bills but the rest of my life is a mess of poor time management. "
301,"I completely understand. Woman-to-woman, I would like to keep this between my step-daughter and I, but I don't know her half as well as her father. What if this has happened before? What if she needs some sort of help? He's her parent, and he's reasonable enough to be there for her without judging her, so maybe I should involve him. She would certainly be grateful towards me if I were to keep this from him, and as much as I want to, I don't know if that's best. Still trying to weigh my options. "
302,"Tell your husband. What if someone had contacted him to say you were having an affair, thinking that was why you were using a fake name?"
303,"&gt; he has requirements he needs met in order to be okay with having children. 

Are you sure he actually wants children and wasn't just punting the issue down the road, hoping those requirements would never be met? I hope that's not what's happening here, but that's how it reads to me."
304,"When was the last time you spoke to him/saw him? It sounds like he made a point to tell you that he was studying and really nervous preparing for this interview. I assume that you didn't just schedule this IUD appointment today.


You say he ""keeps ignoring your calls"". How many times have you called him in how long? If you normally see each other every day and he's been ignoring you for 2 weeks, that's different than if you spoke to him yesterday and you've tried calling him 6 time today. You want to talk to him for ""just an hour,"" which is a really long phone call for most people. He's also really nervous, and is trying to deal with his stress and all the issues of being unemployed. 

Shoot him a text saying, ""I'm proud of you for studying so much, but I'm stressing about the IUD. When you get a chance, can you just call me to talk for 10min"". 


"
305,"Well, it seems like he's not interested in coparenting, amicably or otherwise.

Clean him out, OP. Wonder if his girlfriend will still want him then."
306,"There are so, so many men in this world who would never DREAM of choking you, pushing you, hitting you even at their ansolute angriest. There are men who respect your space and pick up after themselves and support you. In fact there are men who would be HAPPY to do all that, who would do it without having to be nagged or would do it if you asked the first time. These types of men aren't even special, they are basic every day normal men who are displaying the absolute minimum of human decency. The man you are with is less than special. He shouldn't have to be taken to therapy or counseling just to try and be a decent person. You deserve someone better than that, and he doesn't deserve you. Perhaps your abusive family never acknowledged or apologized for their abuse, so you feel as though your husband is automatically better for you, but his actions never should have never happened in the first place. You absolutely do NOT bring out the abusive qualities in your husband, but if your unethical quack therapist truly believes that, then she's admitting herself that he has abusive tendencies that can't be changed, only avoided. This definitely isn't the case with everyone, so why are you settling for someone like that? At the very least you need to fire your current therapist and find your own therapist for yourself who can help you untangle why it is you feel as though you deserve to stay with a man who would almost kill you. "
307,"Just remember, there are three sides to every story. His, hers, and the truth. Anything this guy tells you hardly holds weight since he is a complete stranger. So anything he spins you I would tell your mom. Watch her reaction because that will be telling and you'll have a clue whether he's telling the truth or not."
308,"I essentially grew up as your niece. You think dealing with your SIL is bad? Imagine your SIL outweighed you by 150 lbs, had 2 feet of height on you, was crazy, violent and nuts, lashed out violently if she got an urge, and you were at the complete mercy of her whims on what you were allowed to eat, wear, or read, what hobbies you could have, what you could learn about, where you could go, who you could talk to, whether you would even be allowed to go to school, leave the house, or leave your room. No, really, just sit and imagine for a minute how it would be, as yourself, to live like that with your sister-in-law. Nightmare right? Welcome to my childhood.

I see that you already replied to the comment above suggesting that you make a police report. I'm glad. I second that. Please be brave. I spend a whole childhood wishing that an adult would really stand up for me. Standing up for me in a way that would have REALLY helped would have been difficult, awkward, bridge-burning, and socially disruptive. It would have required a lot of follow through, and a lot of guts. Nobody ever did. Of course, I understand now as an adult how hard it would be. But as a child it still impacts you... nobody ever did. "
309,"Yeah, but she's an adult and this isn't stranger danger."
310,"No, don't let it slide. That's too much.

Also, do you have the feeling he may be abusive towards your sister? I just wanted to check because it could be he's trying to drive a wedge between you two and cut her off from you? I could be barking up totally the wrong tree but I just wanted to mention it, just in case."
311,"*""She thinks you're assigning her boring grown-up books like her parents or a teacher, because at her age, that's what she's experienced in her life so far.""*

Also, it is kind of what OP is doing. Not saying that reading the book wouldn't be helpful, but he comes across as a bit condescending."
312,"&gt; With enough training, do you think I can become as calm and difficult to provoke as you?

I love you."
313,"I can see why you must feel incredibly frustrated about this. It seems to me that the message he is sending to you by his actions, whether he means it or not, is that he doesn't see your time or events as being as important as his own. Understandably that must feel hurtful.

I honestly don't know what you do about it though as you've told him about it several times, by your own account. 

I think if I was in your position I'd try writing down how his actions make you feel and what you would like him to do from now on so that I could either read this to him, or get him to read it. I would probably also say that if he I were to inform him of a time we were due to leave, and he wasn't ready at that time I'd leave without him and that this would make me very disappointed. "
314,I think this is firmly within my business.
315,"First, ""owing sex"" isn't (or at least shouldn't be) a thing.  You're consenting adults - no one should ""owe"" anyone anything.

Second, does she know this is how you de-stress?  Maybe she doesn't realize she's ""denying"" you your ""main de-stress tool.""  In any case, keeping this all inside will only build that resentment.  Talk to her about it and maybe you two can find a middle ground - perhaps even something that de-stresses you both."
316,"Because he thought you were an acquaintance or friend?

Was there anything that was leading towards a relationship?

If someone I barely knew was leaving kissy  faces on my pics I would be a little weirded out if we weren't dating or otherwise close
"
317,She may be bi-polar.  Encourage her to be evaluated by a therapist.
318,"It looks like there might be some mental health issues here, not to mention it seems like your parents either don't know what they're doing, or they're keeping information from you. I can't post a link, but google ""homeschool diploma"", and you'll see that no, the GED is not what you get when you homeschool. Unfortunately, there is still stigma when it comes to GEDs, so I'd look into getting that homeschool diploma. "
319,"Make other plans for the weekend. If she responds after you've made them, let her know that you didn't know she wanted your help (as you don't). I think it's just as likely she's heard from a regular sitter offline or in a private message. But any way you cut it, you have not committed to anything for her, you made an offer she has yet to even acknowledge."

322,"Either skip the get-together or bring your wife along (and don't do anything stupid like get totally plastered), but drop the one-on-one contact and quit playing with fire.  You aren't teenagers any more.  You don't get to go back and investigate that spark - and frankly, even if you did, you'd discover pretty quickly that there's nothing about it you don't already have with the woman you claim to love.  If you've forgotten why you decided she was worth forsaking the what-ifs, then focus on getting the excitement back with her, not indulging in nostalgia."
323,"In the short term, spend Christmas with your mom; she probably needs the support. Decline any invitations from Harold and Samantha. Tell them 'no' like a broken record and keep it short and simple for right now. Don't let them ruin your holiday any more than they already have. Do your best to have fun. 

After the holidays, decide what your plan will be long term.  "
324,"I never said sex was bad. Like I don't understand what you aren't getting. All I was commenting on was ""sex is not a big deal"" Sex is a big deal and there are a lot of stipulations. Telling a 16 year old it isn't a big deal is stupid. "
325,"It isn't weird to have a timeline. I'm a guy and I have a rough idea about where I want to be in life by certain ages. Not to say that the timeline can't be flexible, but it's good to have some sort of plan. "
326,"&gt; My abuser was absolutely shocked when I suggested his behavior was abusive. I mean he was horrified. He could not fathom how on earth I could possibly suggest such a thing. 

I think it's worth emphasizing that very, very, *very* rarely does a person ""mean"" to be abusive or deliberately act in an abusive manner. Even people who will admit to what I'm going to call ""bad behavior"" don't think of it as abuse. They typically think of it as ""A person hurt me, so I got that person back"". In their minds, that makes it not *abuse* but getting even, or even reclaiming their personal power, or showing that people can't just ""run all over them"". 

Nobody wants to be labeled an abuser because abusers are dirty, nasty, stupid alcoholics who kick kittens and slap babies. Or they are these Machiavelli-level manipulators who are doing every single abusive act for a specific, grandiose abusive reason. They're certainly not ""normal"" people. Nobody is *really* that bad.

Except that nearly everybody is that bad - sometimes. Nearly everybody have behaved abusively. Nearly everybody has been hurt and handled that hurt poorly and lashed out and done something to hurt or deny the agency of another human being. I certainly have. 

I do think that one place of disconnect between abusers and the abused is that most abusers have been systematically abused themselves. Look at what the OP wrote both about herself and about her boyfriend's family, and how they were treated. In both cases, the abuse was normalized, and the abused person was attacked when trying to make it clear that their boundaries had been violated and asking for those boundaries to be respected. 

I believe that this both normalizes abuse, and also makes it harder to hear that one is abusive because if someone is repeating actions that were done to them earlier, actions that were justified and normalized by family members and people in positions of authority (parents, teachers, etc), then it can come as a great shock to be called out for doing something that everybody does. 

Having that moment can be a moment of triple-trauma. There is the trauma of knowing that the way you were treated when younger was abusive, and bad, and harmful. While someone may feel vindicated because now they know that they were treated abusively, it's still extremely painful to realize that people who we loved and trusted (and may still well love, and have ongoing relationships with, like parents) did things to us that were deeply harmful. Next, we now have the trauma (if we do have on-going relationships with those who abused us) of realizing that we have current relationships with people who have abused as and still maybe abusing us - this this gulf of ""I love my childhood abuser and still have a relationship with my childhood abuser and how I feel about this relationship has completely changed in a manner of seconds because I've just seen the way s/he treated me and still treats me from a completely different angle"". And finally, we have the realization now that the exact same abusive things that we did and hated, we've just perpetuated on someone we love. So we're now as bad as our abusers. 

Triple-trauma. Is it any wonder that people being confronted with the A word and remember all that run screaming from it? I think a lot of abusers don't even get to the full-on remember part before they lash out and, well, continue to abuse even more viciously, if that gets them away from dealing with all of that. 

Not that it makes any of the abuse someone is currently perpetuating any better. Understanding is not a free pass. Understanding is compassion. It is a call for a person to get help, because these are massive issues that need therapy and thought and time to try to reach some kind of place where they're livable. 

Back to the OP though, I totally agree that he needs to be judged by his future actions. Intent not to abuse doesn't excuse abuse. It being hard to handle being abusive doesn't excuse abuse. OP's boyfriend (and OP too) sound like they both need therapy to work on this. Separate therapy, not couples therapy. At least, not couples therapy right away. But separate therapy so that they both learn the tools to break abusive cycles before they even begin (I specifically say you need therapy too, OP, because if you were in a mentally healthier place, you wouldn't have needed internet strangers to all band together to show you how bad this behavior is. You'd have known it for yourself, and nipped it in the bud earlier. For you, therapy would be about giving yourself far healthier boundaries and keeping yourself safer, which are priceless things to learn). 

And OP's boyfriend needs to learn to let her the fuck go the very second she says ""let me go"". Only that, and continued focus on improving these behaviors will get them both into better places. 

"
327,"Yep, this is what I thought. As I read the OP, I thought, ""This was me"" - but on the other side of some meds and exceptionally good therapy, I am dealing with it much better. 

Talk to your partner when you're away from this situation, out of the house, having a coffee or whatever. Suggest that what she's experiencing might not be simple tired grumpiness, and suggest that she seek further guidance and help for it. She's not enjoying her life, by the sound of it, and neither are you.

For both your sakes, please explore this possibility."

If you live in his place move immediately. If he's living in your either change the locks (not legal) or give him proper notice. If you're both on the lease figure out if you can get out of it (landlord might be able to help) but get out regardless.  
There shouldn't be any ""if it continues"" logic going on here. It's happened, he's the type of person that can act like this towards someone he supposedly cares about. NEVER be with someone like that. "

332,"Honestly, you've really fucked up. As someone who has a certain kink (not anything like yours and more widely accepted), it's your job to communicate what you like during sex and how important it is to you. When she first expressed distaste you should have reconsidered your relationship there. 

At this point, forcing or trying to coerce your fetish on her isn't going to bring either of you joy. If you bring it up along with not being sure about marriage, she's going to feel like she has no choice but to participate or you won't be together anymore. "

If someone has promised monogamy, and then they don't follow through their partner has a right to know. That way they aren't continuing a relationship under false pretences.

He would have spent just as much at my stores as he did Walmart (a Pandora necklace is half the price of the one from Walmart) and he is nowhere near struggling for money. He makes $16 and hour at 50+ hours a week, and while he was building up his story about spending a ton of money on my Christmas present, we were at the casino where he blew $100 from his Christmas bonus and almost took another $100 out just because. We are not hurting for money. I know for a fact it was not the money, that's why I stressed it was not about the money, I know for a fact he was being lazy and not wanting to drive from our small town to the big city."

342,"I've never in my life heard of a person doing this to someone while they pee, but I'm pretty sure it's got something to do with a degradation fetish. He shouldn't be forcing you to participate in his fetish unless you're a willing partner for that kind of thing. 

Also, not only are you vulnerable while you pee but you can't really escape. Without your consent to this, it sounds like an actual assault. 


*Edit:* yep, fart humiliation is definitely a fetish. Thanks Google. 

I think you ought to consider what it says about him that he not only forces you to participate in a fetish that is about humiliating you but that the thought of it ever happening to him elicits such a violent reaction that you then have a panic attack in response.

Please dump him. "
343,"Him not opening up to others... that's his decision though. He could choose to try to make friends or date women and develop relationships with them until he trusts them enough to confide in them. He's chosen not to do that and instead remain obsessed over you. 

Don't let him make you feel guilty because of decisions that *he* makes. "
344,"That question doesn't have a universal answer by any means. But it's a bad year driven by a rare illness that has created neurological issues in the person op loves.

Your husband blaming his affair on your seemingly neglecting him (with a 1 year old baby, a wedding to plan and who knows what else going on for you) is beyond unbelievable. If you want to give him a second chance (I'm all for second chances except when it comes to (repeated/aggravated) abuse), this time he's playing by your rules until further notice. You share his phone location, he must be available to you at all times by phone call or by text, you have full access to all his devices and online accounts, he sits at home and cares for you and your child. If he wants to go out, you go together as a family. Was that woman from his work? Then he gets to look for a new job. Make him block her everywhere and if needed, delete his social accounts. Attend couples counseling. Good luck!     

Edit: let him also show you his bank accounts, whenever there are affairs going on, there might be unusual money spending too."

354,Shocking that having sex with someone can cause an emotional connection.

360,"Hoarder or slob? Can she let things go? Does she raise a fit if you get rid of something? If she doesn't, she's just a slob.

If she let you clean up and redecorate, she wants someone to clean up after her. You should leave when you can, but try to establish some boundaries. Keep as much of your kitchen stuff in your room, wash it and return it to your room. For her stuff, use some of those boxes and toss her dirty dishes and stuff into a box and close it. Stack it on another box. If she asks for her stuff, tell her it's stored in a box. Do not clean up for her, just box it if you don't want to look at it. This will cause some friction. Tell her that you pay half the rent, so you need to use the place.

You will still be stuck with the sweeping and wiping, because she probably won't change. You can threaten to leave and warn off other friends. I wonder what her parents' house looks like."
361,You have no business being in a serious relationship let alone being married. Maybe if you actually communicated the two of you wouldn't fight so much. You have a very ass-backwards view of the way marriage is supposed to work and this is not going to get any better until you get over that.

So here's how not to get fired in the future.

1. Don't be a homophobe. And yes, saying all lesbians=uggos is homophobia.
2. Don't hit on people at work functions.
3. Stop hitting on people when they say they're not interested. That's harassment.
4. Don't get it into your head that your actions would have been OK if she wasn't the CEO's daughter. Most women don't like being treated like this by their coworkers."

369,What are you even going on about? Be specific? He told her they were doing holiday things all day and throws her in this party how the hell would she have known she actually wasn't expected to be there?

377,"The thing is that OP is definitely an adult. She didn't just turn 18 or anything; she's 25.

386,"Make an effort to spend more time together outside of the house, or even inside playing a board game or something.  Not netflix.  Find interests you share and explore them - or take on something new.  Take a painting class together and then go out into the woods and paint waterfalls and shit.  Whatever you want.  Learn sign together so you can say sexy things across the table in front of her parents and stuff.  

As far as your jitters about this whole thing - a lot of it is normal and very understandable. However, the proposal could also be bringing up feelings you've had for a long time, concern about your future etc. and now that you're engaged you are required to face those fears.  Give it a couple weeks and if you still feel that your relationship is in trouble, or heading to trouble, talk to her about it and consider couple's counseling.  Counseling is NOT an admission your relationship is fucked up or anything.  It really can be helpful even for couples who love each other dearly and do just fine together.  "
387,"From the OP: ""Even though this is small it makes me question our future together and I thought we had moved past him and his anger issues but it came out again.""

It doesn't sound like this was an ""otherwise happy relationship."" Dude has had issues with anger management, it seems like. I'll be honest and say that I were in her shoes and this was an isolated incident, while I would be upset over the language, I think we could work through it after three years. But after three years of anger issues and this happening on an anniversary ... I think I'd personally cut and run. At 27, I was thinking about finding someone to marry and be the father of my children. If a man showed repeated signs of anger issues, I would not want him as a co-parent. But again, that's just me. OP needs to decide if she's finally had enough or not."
388,"I think you have some tinted glasses on. You should not feel guilty as the shit she is doing is completely out of hand. The only way to break this cycle is to either leave it (my suggestion) or try communicating better with her but it seems to be beyond that point as of now. A marriage is about compromise, never forget that. It is a two sided thing. You shouldn't have to deal with this abuse. 

Not only is she abusive, but she is downright acting like a little kid. She needs to grow up. It almost seems like you've taken on the role of a parent instead of a SO."
389,"&gt;I have seen her shake the child when upset

She's physically and emotionally abusive, by the looks of things. Are you sure that the child would be best off with your sister?"
390,"You don't have to prove anything to her. She cheated on you and is considering leaving you for a man who is comfortable divorcing his pregnant wife who is also your sister. That doesn't sound like a very good person to have in your life or that she has anyone's interests at heart other than her own. I would assert a boundary of couples counseling, and cutting contact with the brother in law if she wants to work it out. Even if she does, how will your family accept you being with the woman who broke up your sister's marriage? At this point, because of family being involved, I really don't see a way forward for this relationship. Can you even forgive her for doing this to you? To your pregnant sister? "
391,This is gorgeous advice for so many things!!!
392,"I think you should ask your brother the best way to handle it.

I mean unless he objects you could use it to your advantage, but tell anyone dating you that your brother wants to keep your private life away from him unless you end up dating someone for a long time.

396,"Not a deal-breaker. Who cares about what she does on social media? Just unfollow her. It's not required of you to take a look at every single dank meme she posts online. Also, the whole texting thing can be worked on over time.

400,"It's not like you caught it off a toilet seat. Maybe get another test done elsewhere just so you can be 100% sure that you're not that one freak occurence of a false positive. You know you didn't cheat, so there's not much point communicating with him beyond telling him that he gave you chlamydia (so he can get treated and tell whoever else he's sleeping with to get treated as well) and that you're leaving."
401,"That's not exactly that but I agree with some.

First, I will not confront him without proof. It's useless. Secondly, she is not blind about that. The fact that her son leaves school, does not get a job, goes to party, is an issue.

I think I get misunderstood or I wrote badly. My feeling is that the kid is suffering and has tremenous issues with getting into adult age. I recommanded therapy, but for his mother, the situation is different : she thinks he is a wanker, and he seems to try to prove it. 

The problem I personnally face now is that I don't know if I can handle the situation a lot more, like you say. And I am also not sure of what will happen if we kick him out of hte house - like his mother wanted to do (even before the money thing). 

Tbh when I think about the details of the fact, it seems incredible. But it was incredible too to see him smoking weed, taking pills, discovering that he forgot an ashtray full of joints outside, being in an illegal music festival, etc... 

Anything we propose as activity he could engage with us, he says no, then he wants to do it himself + girlfriend, BUT he cannot afford anything as he spend all his pocket money in some days. "
402,"As others have said - there is no other way of contracting unless you've cheated yourself.

It seems like this relationship has run its course - especially with the lack of communication. That is extremely odd. I live with my partner and we still text each other during working days. Heck, I text him from other rooms in my house.

I know this will be difficult, being your first real relationship, but this is just an experience everyone goes through in life - the horrendous first break-up! Oddly, for me anyway, it was the worst one. But trust me, you will move past this, you will be happy and you will find someone else who means more to you than this person when you're ready. 

Just let yourself feel what you feel for a couple of days - cry, watch films, eat chocolate, call him all the names under the sun and then let go. You're far too young and have far too much ahead of you to dwell upon this absolute doofus. He isn't worth your time!"
403,If you cave to the first tantrum you're laying the groundwork for the next 100.
404,"Try talking to a Taiwanese person. Most of the world talks in stereotypes which are sweeping and ignorant. 


Stereotypes exist for a reason - they don't come out of nowhere. Those stereotypes are ones I've learnt from Taiwanese people, in Taiwan, and if OP asked in any forum that was full of people with a bit more experience with Taiwan (and able to approach it from a non-western perspective) he'd get similar advice. Hell, OP, go and post on PTT! I'm sure there are exceptions, but we're talking about the majority.


He hasn't said anything to indicate that the in laws are homophobes in the western sense (particularly the fire and brimstone shit that leads Americans to send their kids to conversion torture).  It seems a traditional issue of face/concern (關心) with an extra-challenging twist.


Gay rights have actually been in the news a lot in Taiwan recently so it would be useful if OP's husband bothered to look into the dialogue and approach his parents from that angle... But that would require him to take responsibility for managing the relationship with his parents, which as OP has indicated he isn't super interested in doing. Not stereotypical at all... I've never heard of that happening... /s."
405,"I don't really believe you have sympathy at all.  You say you felt bad, but that didn't stop you from forcing him to leave and threaten him.  I wouldn't have taken it that far unless he was actually causing trouble.   I get your reasoning but you also could have minded your own business.   "
406,Call the cops on her Christmas party.
407,"&gt;She said everyone would be expected to get at least 4 gifts for the younger cousins

Four gifts each!?!

Must be just this time of year but it's staggering how many stories come up in this subreddit of people being so demanding with gift-giving.  Really takes the sense of altruism and charity out of the event.

&gt;I said if buying gifts was a priority, maybe we could draw names instead, but that was shot down. 

This is what we do.  We have a Kris Kringle with all the cousins and aunts.  You buy for someone and someone else buys for you.  That way, you give each of your immediate family a gift and then one for a cousin/aunt.  We also give gifts for our grandparents and but that's usually something small like a scratchy card or something.

Maybe it's just me but I'm pretty ambivalent when it comes to gift-giving.  I have a full time job and pretty much want for nothing so even a joke gift or something tokenistic is enough for me.

408,"It was never really a choice as much as always been a part of me. I was raised in a very conservative household, and raised under the impression that children wasn't a choice. Met some kids when I was 13 who were just like ""Nah, marriage and kids aren't for us.""

And my world was turned upside down, and from that moment on I was like. ""Heck, if it's a choice, then I'm not going to have them!""

My mom is an amazing cook, and I do pretty well for myself too. It's hard for me to be impressed by things I can make at home, but I still try to enjoy the food for what it is! If she can't relax herself enough to do that, it sounds beyond exhausting. I couldn't handle it."

414,"I know a divorce lawyer who told me that her busiest week of the year for new business is the week that the credit card bills from Christmas show up.  So yes, this is a very hard time of year.

What I don't hear in this post at all is what your wife has said when you have expressed your concerns about he budget, about the loud, stressful environment, and about her children's dysfunctional and unwelcoming behavior.  In essence, what I don't hear is any evidence that the two of you are functioning as a team, that you have each others' back.

Maybe seeing a family counselor in the new year should be your Christmas present to one another.  

And it sounds like the 14-year old also probably needs some therapy too.  Being a compulsive liar who feels the need to assert his dominance over others by messing with them does not sound like the recipe for a good future for him. But that's a super tough problem that can only be solved by you, your wife and the kid finding a way to work together honestly.

I guess what it all boils down to is can you and your wife learn to work together to solve the problems in your life?  Can you agree on what your goals should be and how to tackle them together?  If you can't, I don't see how any of this works.  If you can, all the rest is survivable."
415,"&gt;think it was clear that the spark was there again. Neither of us acted on it, but the smile between us kind of spoke volumes.

I'm just going to guess that when you and your wife spend time with this good dude they arn't eye fucking the shit out of each other like you describe you and your friends interaction. I'm guessing your ""sparks"" were noticed that's why your wife was uneasy. Don't try to throw fairness around when only one of you is acting out."
416,"I get that sugar coating it doesn't help.  But this woman is an abuse victim and making her shoulder the blame equally with her abuser is not right.  He's gaslighting her into believing she's just as bad a he is.  This woman does need to leave, but she's not chickening out.  She's abused.  And it's not a matter of some people not doing well with each other.  He shouldn't be with anyone until (and IF) he can work out his abusiveness in therapy."

Lord you need to pump the brakes hard as hell. "
421,"I am so sorry. 

I can understand wanting to wait 12 weeks.  But at this point, your fiance no longer gets to tell you what to do.  You are a grown adult.  No one has to ""let"" you do anything.  

Your MIL will blame you no matter what, whether you announce tomorrow or when your child is 3 years old.  So why make that a factor in the decision?  And if she's not nice to you, she doesn't get to see her grandchild. 

You are holding all of the cards here,  yet you are letting everyone else push you around.  Time to be the Mama Bear and take charge.  No more asking if you can do things. From now on,  YOU tell everyone else how is going to be. "
422,"Curious?  Recently?  Sounds more like this has been the way she feels for a long time and she couldn't keep it in anymore- she even said she felt like she would ""blow up"" from the urges.  I don't blame him for being crushed especially since they have a counselor and safe space she could have brought it up in, not to mention she could have phrased things better- telling someone you ""hate"" having sex with them is usually a relationship ender.  Unless OP is cool with an open marriage this is done for.  "
423,"I had an ex that cheated on me in a similar manner. 


I say ""cheated"" because so many signs prove that it is, **indeed** infidelity. 


He actively hid this activity from you. He has discussed sexually explicit activities with another individual. He has used romantic pet names with another individual. And finally, the most important factor: it makes you feel like you've been cheated on. 


Barring particularly self-conscious and jealous individuals, my rule is as follows: if you feel that you've been cheated on, then you've probably been cheated on. 


And this is all just semantics anyway. I'm sorry this happened to you and I know how frustrating it is to see your entire trust for one person crumble to pieces because of some dirty words on a computer screen. 


Confront him with these messages. Screenshot and print them out, sit down with him, and hand him the messages. Don't say anything and see how he reacts. 


Of course my advice is to dump him. I stayed with my cheater for much too long after this ordeal and ended up getting hurt even worse. But you are the only one who can make this decision. 



Like I said, see how he reacts. If he immediately admits fault and begs forgiveness, maybe there's still hope. 



Oh, and contrary to some other comments: don't feel bad for snooping in this situation. It seems that you didn't snoop beforehand and you only looked at his computer after you had a pretty solid hunch (I'd even go so far as to say evidence) that something fucked up was going on. "
424,"I think you were very clear and helpful. 

Op obviously doesn't respect nor love herself very much, which is utterly sad. 

Though the truth is hard, it is necessary. He really is just using her and she deserves much more. 

Op, take this good advice and wake up and see that you don't deserve to feel that you aren't important enough or good enough.

You are. Treat yourself better. 

You made a right decision breaking it off, stick to that and get away from this weak, selfish brat. Hugs"

426,"Well, but it's a lot harder to give milk to a milk bank than to a pervert. Source: tried to donate my extra breastmilk to my local milk bank, was told I needed to throw away everything I had already pumped, pay hundreds of dollars out of pocket for medical testing on myself, submit the test results, and then pump only with their approved storage system. 

I am not saying they are wrong to have such a high barrier to donating; the babies' safety needs to come first. But it was too much expense and trouble for me. In particular I did NOT have hundreds of dollars to spend on testing.  And so I didn't donate breastmilk back when I was lactating like a champ. A pervert would have just taken it and said  thank you."
427,"&gt;You need to accept that you don't always know best, and work a lot harder to learn about how your workplace functions so you can smoothly integrate yourself and your ideas in a way that is productive for the team. You need to become a good team member and follower. You need to remind yourself repeatedly that even if you think a decision or procedure doesn't make sense or is wrong, there may be (1) information and experience that you lack that make it harder for you to understand why it's actually a good call, and (2) perspectives other than yours that are valid.

So on point.  I am a 54 year old woman in the IT field and it never fails.  These young folks come in with a degree and a couple of years experience and think they are going to revolutionize a Fortune 100 company overnight.  It is annoying as shit (almost as annoying as the fact that most of them think I am a secretary instead of a database architect with 30 years of experience) and sometimes it is very hard for me to refrain from slapping them down when they act stupid.

We were a Fortune 100 company before *you* got here for a reason.  OP would do herself a great service by simply starting with the attitude that ""I have a lot to learn"".

OP - it is fine to try new ideas.  Just try this approach...

""Guys, I thought we could improve X if we tried Y.  But I am still new and there may be reasons to not do this or maybe you have tried it before.  What do you guys think?""

When you approach things like this, like  /u/bobloblawlovesme said - with some humility and a learning attitude, you will find people will do 2 things.  They will listen to your ideas and they will learn to respect you and value your input.

Good luck to you OP."
428,"Wow, I would be super creeped out if my boss got me a Victoria's Secret gift card. That's so inappropriate and unprofessional and could even be construed as sexual harassment considering it's a lingerie store. What in the hell possessed to think it was a good idea to give your secretary something so intimate? You'd better grovel to your girlfriend. Try a damn coffee card or something next time. Jesus."

430,"That whole approach to relationships is so..depressing? Mistrustful? I dunno. If I was THAT terrified of my partner exploding and taking me for everything I'm worth, then I don't think I'd date in the first place. Ffs they're _relationships_ not _competitions_."
431,"It's weird for Americans, but it's true that getting married after 5 months is normal for someone your girlfriend's age (especially since she is 30 Korean age).

If you don't want to marry her right this second, then that's the end of the line. Because in her mom's mind, you're wasting her daughter's time when she could find someone else and get married. There's no long engagement either, because planning a wedding Korean style takes about 3 months max. 

There's little compromise on this. You either marry her in a few months or break up. Chalk it up to cultural differences.

As for her mom, hell, I'd be ready to get my kid out of my house at 30 too. Korean moms usually have a lot of influence over their adult kids' lives because it's normal for the kids to live off them until they're married. Will it ever go away? Maybe not, but that's also something you need to consider.

432,"Good for you! Could try reaching out to lgbtq resources for youth, might get better help quicker.  They have a solid rutines, and tend to have a network for handeling dysfunctional families in place. 
"
433,"You have to be prepared to not give a fuck what they think or what kind of tantrums they throw.

It's gonna go something like this:

YOU: ""Hi Mom and Dad. Do you remember that nice guy you saw me speaking to a while back? He's actually my boyfriend. We have been together for 3 years and have a wonderful relationship. I hope you'll welcome him into our family.""

FAMILY: ""This is the worst thing ever, we're so ashamed of you, you're a terrible daughter, we can't stand this and are going to disown you.""

YOU: ""I'm sorry to hear that. I love you guys and I'll miss having you in our lives, but that's your decision. When you're ready to accept the man I love and have chosen as my partner, let me know.""

Then get on with your life. Don't give in to their pressure. Don't argue. Don't negotiate. Don't feel you have to defend your choice of partner or your right to make that choice. Don't try to compromise. They'll probably come around eventually, but you need to SHOW THEM that you are OK with them being upset and THEY are they ones who need to change their attitude if they want to have a relationship with you. "
434,"a little update: she told me that her portion of the trust goes to the kids if she dies.

While that is OK, my inheritance goes to her directly if I die (and to the kids if she dies). I suppose I am little miffed that I have been left out of the equation here, and that even if nothing happens to her, she wants to keep the accounts in her name. 

She is a stay-at-home-mom who homeschools. I have been supporting us since day one with my career. If she died and I had to quit my job and take care of the kids for 5+ years, my savings would be gone. The kids would hit 18 and inherit a couple million bucks from their mother.

This is why I wanted life insurance."
435,"Holy shit, I thought this was out of college kids."
436,"&gt;I have been dating their daughter for a long time

And yet you don't know how to join a conversation with her, her mother, and her brother by now?
&gt;I think most people would agree that giving your guest your attention and doing what they want is the best and most polite way of being a host.

You've been dating her six fricking years, hon. You're not ""a guest"" anymore, you are her boyfriend and you should have learned a long time ago how to act like a part of her family. I really don't see anything else to fight about, and I think you would've been a lot more patient with her simple falling asleep if you didn't also constantly subject yourself to people you resent for not treating you like a prince. She shouldn't be so dismissive of your feelings here, and she shouldn't stonewall you. But if you've fought her about her family before, I wonder if this isn't the only way she has to deal with you right now. Nevertheless, I don't see how you two move forward with this much anger and resentment towards each other, and no means to resolve it. You're too young to settle for a toxic relationship, it's time to move on."

440,"Looks like someone you guys know want to break you guys up, but who? 

Though I guess you'll both find out tomorrow? 

If she doesn't show up then you'll know it was a fraud.

Otherwise, make sure there's a trusted person nearby when she meets this person. "
441,"Look at it this way.... Your girlfriend had to find out through social media that you went on this trip. Not only that, you took a female friend with you. From a female perspective, that looks shady af. She's probably more pissed off that she found out the way that she did (through the tagged photo). 

At the end of the day, she's going to have to take your word for it. I'm sure there's a million scenarios going through her head, and basically torturing herself if anything happened between the both of you. The best thing to do at this point is to apologize for the fact that you weren't upfront about going on this trip you didn't think it through by taking a *female* (key word) friend and how bad it must have looked even if nothing happened. "
442,"Of course. I am about as girl power as you get and you still want your partner to find you attractive.  There's a difference between not allowing your partner to control how you look/what you do and not allowing them to have input.  If a barbell between her eyebrows is more important than his feelings, well then... that tells you something.  "
443,"Yeah, it's a feature both men and women posses. No need to put it all on women."

446,"I can really understand this. It's so hard to see your parents feel betrayed, too. It's so normal to want to keep information from people when you know it will make them sad.

But you aren't the one that did anything wrong here. He has admitted to raping you--having sex without your consent--multiple times now. He doesn't respect you, and doesn't respect your consent. That's scary. Of course he has good qualities--you wouldn't be with him if he didn't. Rapists and abusers can be great parents and friendly people. It's hard for their victims to leave because they have these good qualities, and because abusers are good at isolating them and creating ties--like children--that are hard to break. They also use their good qualities to manipulate their partners.

Your partner knew he needed to get you pregnant to keep you, so he raped you. Remind yourself of that, daily. No matter the love or the good times or the way your family looks at him, he's not a good partner and your relationship is not one your son should see and model good relationship on. 

I really think you need a support system that knows the truth. Your parents would want to know. Imagine how you'd feel if your son was in your situation. You'd want to know and support him. 

You can totally do this. You deserve so much better."

He may agree that he understands it doesn't mean 100% obedience all the time, but if he gets heated if you won't do something in the future will he try and use the vow against you? A few years down the line if you guys are arguing more frequently would he try and say ""well you vowed to obey me"" and blame you for ruining your marriage by not doing so?


Definitely nip that possibility in the bud before agreeing. "
451,"A) Marriage counseling is not recommended in abusive relationships because the abuser can use the sensitive information they hear there, and the rules and terminology the counselor sets up, to manipulate their victim further.

B) Your counselor is SO FUCKING WRONG I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND HOW THIS PERSON IS IN THIS PROFESSION. ""Victims of abuse bring out the abusiveness in their partners""? What the actual fuck??? That is disgusting victim-blaming. Just vile and so, so wrong. Abusers abuse because they like the results. Previous abuse victims are frequent targets because the coping mechanisms that we develop to survive the abusive relationship DO help us survive, but unfortunately also make it harder to identify and resist abuse in the future. A non-abusive person DOES NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT, they wouldn't even know how! Normal people don't hurt and intimidate and manipulate and gaslight the people they claim to love! Past abuse doesn't fucking change that!

Let me guess, this """"""counselor"""""" is not an accredited psychologist. Probably affiliated with a religious organization. If I'm wrong it's even worse, they need to lose whatever licensing and accreditation they have because they are literally trying to help an abuser keep a victim under his thumb. Ugh, I need a shower just thinking about it."
452,"It can go both ways. I've read a couple posts where the woman gets resentful because she didn't count on her partner being willing to sleep with whoever comes their way, while she stays selective. "

Go to the dean and tell him that you want to be expelled because of your behavior as you mercilessly bullied a fellow student who will remain nameless. You will also want that put on your permanent record.

455,"You don't have to be turned on to make her feel like you sexually desire her. Is the issue just that you have a lower sex drive than she wants - or is it that you don't show her much sexual attention in general? You don't have to have a boner to (a) show her sexual attraction, eg checking her out obviously, giving sexual compliments or (b) give her a sensual back rub that ends in a happy ending for her with your hands and mouth or (c) depending on her tastes and your comfort, grabbing her and pushing her onto the bed and giving her an orgasm or two with your hands or a vibrator or dildo.

Do you do sweet things for your wife? Cuddle her, kiss her nose, make her food, tuck her in? If you can't be turned on more often, what if you instead treat 'make her feel sexually desired and/or give her actual sexual pleasure' as another sweet thing you try to do at least once a week or whatever? Then if you happen to get turned on by the end of it you can both have a happy ending, but if not then tell her you just love touching her, her pleasure and her happiness but you don't need to get off right now, yourself.

If all that sounds like too much work then you aren't committed to solving the thing that's making her desperately unhappy right now. If she's having this difficult of a time with some outside attention, you can bet she is desperately unhappy feeling undesired. 

Edit: I suspect your wife might feel similarly to people posting in /r/deadbedrooms if this is a reoccurring theme. I was in a relationship with someone who was too tightly wound about sex to ever express much desire for me, although we had routine uninteresting awkward duty sex every couple of weeks. And we had plenty of platonic affection. But I need more than ""platonic"" from a sexual relationship. I was desperately, desperately unhappy and no communication could seem to explain to her why I wanted to feel like my partner wants to fuck me. When i started responding to outside attention like your wife did that's when I knew it had to end soon. My self esteem was so damaged - and, let me tell you op, I'm pretty hot and actually get a lot of attention, but it was my reaction to that attention that changed. Leaving her was the best decision I ever made, because being with someone for whom my sexual involvement was a chore was crushing me."

So the answers to your questions are what make this hard. Ben and I have been together for a very long time. In that time, it took me 2 months to find work once. He covered our shared bills, while I took a loan from my mom to stay afloat.

It's a weird mix of stingy and generous. He gave me a 12K loan, no questions asked, to cover my master's degree. He never gave me a hard time about it, but I made sure to pay him back within 3 months of graduating.

He refused to help me buy airfare to visit my grandmother for the first time actually. But at one point, when my immigration status was in jeopardy, he was willing to marry me on the spot and pay thousands in lawyer fees. Didn't come to that, luckily, but it was generous because at the time we were not engaged.

Of course, if everything was simple, we would never feel conflicted. But I know this situation is not okay and that I need to get out.

476,"Scanned through the thread and read an eyeful of really bad advice straight out of the little red books issued by the central committee.

You are suffering from **Retroactive Jealousy**. 

Google it.

The problem is a bug in the firmware of humanity. RJ is a form of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD).

What's happening to you is this:

-  You hear a story about the past.

-  Your imagination makes the story vivid. (This is an automatic reaction for many.)

-  The part of your brain that mediates feeling of jealousy  ('mate guarding' to a zoologist), reacts to your imaginings. 

This is key. While the subject matter of your ruminations is of the past, *the ruminating is very much in the present*. 

If you were to find your girlfriend in the arms of another man today, everyone would understand and sympathize with your probable reaction.

This is the thing...

The part of your brain that reacts with jealousy DOES NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN WHAT YOU SEE WITH YOU EYES AND WHAT YOU SEE WITH YOUR IMAGINATION.

So you make a mind movie.

You watch it in your head.

You feel bad, so you watch it again (this time with even MORE detail).

Now you feel worse.

Wash, rinse, repeat.

What you need isn't a re-education camp, but a few sessions of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy  (CBT).

Google it.

477,"Do housework. When you care for your child, don't act like a babysitter, act like a parent. Make sure you put in 110% effort to your partner getting off during sex. Take your partner on dates and tell her she's beautiful. 

It's pretty easy. "
478,"The biggest issue I see is that she keeps getting emotionally invested too soon. Desperation attracts people looking to take advantage. I think your mom needs to see a therapist and build up her self esteem and self-reliance. It's totally normal to want to be in a relationship, but not the extent that she's ignoring all warning signs and getting so attached that it's *heartbreaking* when she finds out she was lied to. So step #1 is to work on herself. After that she can go back to another dating website or try a matchmaker (they honestly can be helpful) or just join a bunch of meetup groups - both dating and non-dating oriented."
479,"It's not as if the brother would be able to rent out the place the other 3-4 days a week, so that isn't really a fair solution to him."
480,"You don't trust your girlfriend, are insanely jealous and possessive, and started a fight with her because she went to a pub with her female traveling partner while on vacation? Gee I wonder why she keeps things from you.

It's not that I don't sympathise with people having problems. But when it's all they talk about, to the point of stressing *me* out over having to be around them, it's too much.

She is going to see any attempt at an apology from you as what it is: an effort to make yourself feel better. You didn't give a fuck about her feelings when you were shitting on her, don't bother pretending to now. Do her a favor and just leave her the fuck alone. "
495,"Sure, anything is possible. But I think it's more likely that she has something going on that brought on this completely new behavior.  She's in debt. She feels powerless about being a non-earner. She wants something extravagant and is uncomfortable bringing it up. She wishes she had some financial control or autonomy. Who knows. 

But if they've had a happy marriage for 12 years it's worth exploring these things rather than just assuming she's some well trained sociopathic money grubbing chameleon that he should walk away from because he's seen her true self *finally*."

I'm guessing that this is far from the first family meeting and that they're usually ugly shitshows that make everybody feel bad, so yeah, if that's the case then that's a shitty thing for him to do on Christmas Eve, no question.  You've already ruled out boycotting the meeting, so put it on your sister to fix this since she created this mess.  I hope she's apologized already, and she needs to sit down with your dad and ask him not to put the whole family through hell because of her mistakes.  "

501,I second this. They sound disgusting. 
502,"Overreaction? Yes. Someone else mentioned picking your battles which is fair. 

To add... this sounds like the typical ""Do I look fat"" question that's often times portrayed in tv and I assume in real life(although it has never been asked of me). To bring this up is to imagine yourself in his shoes. 

What if you threw on a dress(nice dress. Nothing wrong with it at all), and he told you that you have better dresses? Even if he wasn't intentionally trying to hurt your feelings, it possibly could. 

Here. Overreaction. Yes. Hurt his feelings? Yes. Should you apologize and care that something is bothering him? Yes. I think you did the right thing with the quick apology."
503,"This sure doesn't seem like a big deal to me.  Good riddance!  They can stew in their trashy-behavior without you.

What in the world is wrong with your sister?  Maybe she needs a lesson in ""Cop Family 101"", but both my parents were cops and I was never once stupid enough to pull the ""My Mom is your boss"" card.  It's tacky, it's immature, and it's not cool.  If you are doing something that's going to get you arrested, take your lumps and get arrested calmly like a reasonable adult.  Chances are good that if you behave appropriately (and what you did wasn't TOO heinous) that they'll take you down to the station, give you a stern talking to, and let you go with no charges pressed.  Perhaps your sister learned a lesson and won't start shouting in an officer's face and acting like a complete fool next time.

Your poor husband - he is probably SO embarrassed to go to work right now.  You support your husband, spend the holidays with him, and tell your family that your sister's behavior was disgusting and inappropriate and it better never happen again."
504,"I'm sorry, but I don't think he has any kind of interest in commitment to you. You should stop talking to and seeing him, and move on. You're more likely to find someone who matches up with you in terms of expectations and experience if they are closer to you in age. A guy who is almost twice your age is unlikely to see you as any kind of legitimate long term romantic partner. "

507,"&gt; Have it include the pictures from hospital. Tag with shit like ""saving my sister's life"". Explain whole story. Pictures of her in isolation room

Jesus, no. Not only does sister likely not want her hospital pictures online (I know I wouldn't), the ""saving my sister's life!"" thing would make it look like OP was doing this for attention, like posting a selfie with the corpse during a funeral (probably a horrifically inappropriate analogy, but it's the first that came to mind). The whole point of this post was that this whole thing is about about OP's sister's health, and OP's ex is trying to make it about herself. Posting that stuff would make it seem like OP was also trying to make it all about *him*self."
508,"I think instead of focusing on consideration for you personally, focus on the money.  Tell him that you need him to contribute more to the budget and replace anything he throws away.  Just say that he uses considerably more resources than you and you can't afford it.  Either you have to stop buying most things together or he has to contribute more money to the shared budget."
509,"Tell her and her mother what date you're leaving.  And then go.  Your friend's Mom can leave the hospital long enough to set up something else.  

It's good to help out your friend but you shouldn't give up your airline tickets to help.  And it isn't your responsibility to line up a backup in this situation."
510,"That makes a lot of sense, and is a very kind perspective. "
511,I'm sorry. I was just so overwhelmed by the whole situation (losing potential child) that I was just too exhausted and upset to put up much of an argument. 
512,"You are really reaching with assumptions there. Controlling or manipulative? He's speaking his mind. I don't find tattoos attractive honestly, tributary or not. It'd be a deal breaker for me but my SO feels the same as I do about tattoos so I don't have this problem. "
513,The fact that you keep dodging the question is pretty telling.
514,"Because it's disgusting to start treating someone like OP's friends are treating him just because they saw him driving around in a nice rented car once. 

If I saw a friend in a fancy car I wouldn't start treating them any differently. Any decent person would do the same. It's even worse that OP doesn't even have money and yet they still don't believe him. Seriously, who the fuck does that? Shallow, grasping people, that's who. "
515,"I know! That's what stood out to me too. ""Most days"". Even if it's the briefest of comments he was making, and not intended to be taken seriously, I'd have some serious reservations about it after 2 weeks - let alone 2 years! "
516,"Exactly. And fertilizers are a HUGE problem. Causing dead zones, killing sea life, bleaching coral. "
517,"You do not owe her that and I'm genuinely doubtful that her therapist recommended that to her.

No ex gets to confront you just to make themselves feel better. That's never an okay thing.

Block on her facebook. It's not cold or harsh. It's perfectly reasonable and the kindest thing you can do. Bella can't cope with you being a normal human being, doing normal human dating things. If you leave her on Facebook, you'll live in constant fear of her irrational expectations. You don't need to have those sorts of boundaries enforced on your life.

You were not wrong for breaking up with her. You may not have communicated as clearly as you should have, but it's also rather likely that Bella heard what she wanted to hear, and she wanted to hear that you were dumping her because of the distance, not because you didn't enjoy her company."
518,I'd just add I'd be paying him back in interest as well
519,"I'm usually against criticizing parents for things when they are asking for help. And based on the original post I'm not even sure that the child actually sleeps with it, but I agree that this is SO important. Prevent SIDS, put NOTHING in with your baby when it sleeps. 

This is in no way against OP, again, not even sure the son sleeps with it, but it is a very important reminder that some people lose their precious children to this. 

Edited to add: your brother is acting extremely jealous, don't let this escalate at all, shut it down now. "
520,"Not everyone gets cues - if you were being playful to begin with and he didn't realize you were truly hurt or upset, I'd find it difficult to label the behavior abusive. When you clearly verbalized your position he seemed genuinely remorseful and and hasn't repeated the behavior. You guys have been together for two months, what I'm reading sounds like learning to be in each other's physical space.

But obviously there's something you're more concerned about, a gut feeling that this person is unsafe. Maybe it's your past, or maybe it's actually him. Get a counselor or a close friend to talk out the past abuse with and take this relationship super slow."
521,"He shouldn't slam dishes. That's childish and point to possible anger issues. 

But the way you reacted was also really childish. Rather than say you weren't going to eat it you could have addressed the behavior right away and told him that slamming things isn't acceptable. 

You should sit down and talk about how you argue and agree on ways to improve it. Look up resources about de-escalating fights and try to work on focusing on the issue you're disagreeing on. Bringing it up now when you're both calm, but the last fight is still fresh is a good time. "
522,"You've got a bad gut feeling about Janet, and just from reading this I don't think her actions really add up. How did she know? If it was so urgent why didn't she contact you sooner? Why does she need to take care of it? 

I would 1. Document (screenshot? I don't know exactly how you communicated) your interactions with the guy and with Janet about what she's going to do. ""He said he was 23 on his profile"" isn't an excuse but it's potentially evidence that contradicts her version of the story and 2. Check in with another trusted friend who knows her - have they heard her talking about you or acting suspicious? If everyone agrees there's something off about her behavior you'll have friends on your side. "
523,"Your fucking post history dude, take a look at yourself."
524,"Most mentorship programs require the mentor to commit to at least a year.  Granted, they can't force the mentor to remain in the program if they choose to leave, but they vet the people enough that, barring some crazy situation, the person is in it for the long haul.

And yes, there is usually some sort of proper closure that occurs when a mentorship is dissolved.  If you have a Boys and Girls Club in your area you could start there.  Or just google your town and mentoring programs (I work at an organization that provides mentoring).

In the meantime, as sucky a tactic as it might be, maybe you could try to distract her with some fun.  Take her to a movie, buy her a new toy, do something fun just the two of you.  I don't normally advocate bribery/tactics, but you've given her time to get over BF and it's slow going, so maybe something in the meantime would distract her enough to forget about him."

What he did was inexcusable and you MUST report him. For your own safety. for the safety of your future grades. for the safety of future students.

None of this is your fault. He preyed on a vulnerable student and that means he has no place in a college. Please, I urge you to report this. Yes, he may well lose his job, yes he may well lose his wife, but (1) he brought this on himself (he will 100% know this was wrong) and (2) colleges and students NEED to be protected from people like him  "

529,I have a feeling this is just one example and not the entire reason she's upset as well.
530,"I too overreact to benign things like this. Have a conversation with her about it. ""Hey, I wasn't trying to read over your shoulder but I kinda did. Here's what I saw. What's going on there?"" 

If you've already prepared to emotionally sever yourself from her, then having a conversation can't be any worse. 

Yeah, you'll look like a dingus for invading her privacy (I too have a bad habit of reading over people's shoulder, but I try not to when I notice I'm doing it) but as long as you have a *calm, rational* discussion with absolutely no accusations, the worst that will happen is that she'll confirm your nuclear suspicions and you spend the rest of your time up there as, if not friends, then acquaintances, and she drives you home at the end.

535,"You guys are incompatible with regards to this issue.  You have to decide whether it's something worth breaking up over.

I gotta ask though, are you happy? This is baseless conjecture and I'm only asking it because a friend went through a similar thing, but after this friend's anecdotal experience, sometimes it's better to be with a ""dumb"" girl who makes you happy than a ""smart"" who makes you feel like shit.  Good luck dude."

538,"&gt; he won't talk to anyone

Well then, Jake won't do MMA any more until he does.

Whatever his excuses - be that unhappiness at your new marriage, or stress at school - Jake has a serious problem with aggression. Not 'attitude' - violence. He is a young man, and at an age where he needs to learn to control the power and temper that comes with testosterone.  It is not about him showing respect to his parents and family any more - it is about him learning not to be a _fucking thug_.

So no more MMA, no more violent TV for him to fantasize over, no more _anything_ until he learns to control himself and makes amends sincerely. Honestly I think he may need some kind of psychiatric help.

And it's for Jake's sake as much as anyone's. My dad once told me something very apposite here - and he was a violent, miserable piece of shit if ever there was one - he said, ""the problem with being a hard man, u/Bosola, is that there's always someone harder"". One day your son - thinking he's invincible - may pick a fight with someone who is bigger, meaner and has friends. And that's how angry young men end up in wheelchairs."
539,"No, you should invite him to take a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut, cut contact, and avoid like the plague. That's a whole drill team worth of red flags. "

547,"&gt;but I'm tired of her walking all over me and getting me to do everything for her.

It seems like this isn't really just about the snow but more of an ongoing problem with other things? Sit down with her and talk about the *root* of the problem, not the effects of it. Tell her you know she's used to her parents doing everything for her but you are not her father. Yall are equal and she can't act like a princess for the rest of her life. Maybe use this and other situations as an example but it seems like the solution of this problem isn't going to be ""learn how to use the snow blower"""
548,"I have always believed that there are many right ways to complete a task.  Just because it's different than the way I prefer to do it doesn't make it wrong.

One of the fastest ways to guarantee that your spouse doesn't do household tasks is to criticize the way they do those tasks.

Maybe ask her to write down the things she believes you are doing wrong on a list rather than correcting you in the moment.  Then at the end of the day go over the list.  She will hopefully see that she's nitpicking or you may see several things repeated that are easy for you to change."
549,"You view her with disgust and contempt, and subconsciously she knows that. Even if she loses weight to please you, it will gnaw away at her inside for the rest of her life, which will end up causing her a whole new set of health problems. You will find yourself constantly feeling angry for reasons you don't quite understand because of the undercurrents. 

Maybe she does need to change her life but you are not able to be her support through that.

The only thing I can think of that MIGHT be helpful is if you can find her a support group to join that can provide her structure, rather than all of it coming from you. But she has to actually want to join it, if it's just you pushing her into it it will never help. 

Otherwise you may need to split up, or at least take a break from each other romantically. You can say you're concerned, you can say you are still her friend but you can't be with her as a partner right now, but you can't actually make her change. She has to want things for herself. Doing it only because you push her into it will have terrible consequences in the long run."

551,"It's ok to be upset about the way someone treats you even if there's a health problem at the root of their behavior. This isn't something I came up with myself, but it's such a perfect description of your situation that I have to quote it:

If you step on my foot, you need to get off my foot.

If you step on my foot without meaning to, you need to get off my foot.

If you step on my foot without realizing it, you need to get off my foot.

If everyone in your culture steps on feet, your culture is horrible, and you need to get off my foot.

If you have foot-stepping disease, and it makes you unaware you’re stepping on feet, you need to get off my foot. If an event has rules designed to keep people from stepping on feet, you need to follow them. If you think that even with the rules, you won’t be able to avoid stepping on people’s feet, absent yourself from the event until you work something out.

If you’re a serial foot-stepper, and you feel you’re entitled to step on people’s feet because you’re just that awesome and they’re not really people anyway, you’re a bad person and you don’t get to use any of those excuses, limited as they are. And moreover, you need to get off my foot.

Your boyfriend is trampling all over your metaphorical feet, and it's not your job to pretend he's not squashing your toes."
552,"&gt;Even though we've only been together for a year, would I be dumb for staying with someone who is clearly so against something so important to me?

You and I have very different definitions of a few hours. 

He initially told her he would be catching the 1am train home.  When he was not back and it was 2:30am she attempted contacting him. It took over 45 minutes for her to get in contact with him when she realized he wasn't home yet. When she told him to stop drinking and come home he said okay. (About here is where I would say he was gone a few extra hours). 4:30am rolls around and he still isn't home so she attempts to contact him again to no avail.  He doesn't get back to her until 7:30am and then doesn't actually get on the train home until 8am.

He didn't get on the train home until 7 hours after what was initially planned."

558,"Yes this is the answer...or at least it was for me.

 It took me into my second year to realize that i dont need ti worry about their reactions to things they might not like.  I decided on a whim to get a simple cartilage piercing (something id wanted in highschool but my parents told me will ruin my life and will never get a job with).  I knew theyd hate it but i did it...i think maybe 1 year later my mom saw it shockingly and asked me when i got it..i told her it was 1 year ago.  In my mind i was kind of waiting for her to lose it and tell me to take it out but she just kind of laughed and said ""of course you'd do that"".  It was dumb but i remember feeling such relief that i am in control and can choose for myself."
559,"What an ass. It was meant to be a nice celebration for you and he went out of his way to ruin it because he wanted to go to another party? And then the passive aggressive comment about his friends not liking you together.

For your sister tagging along, it's their car, so you're pretty much stuck following their rules. You'd have to decide if she's independent enough to handle being alone or that she wouldn't spill the beans to your parents, but giving her $30 and leaving her at the campus movie theater for two hours would be one way to get some alone time.

566,"I didn't, I just made a mental note to not have anything to do with them again. I think the girlfriend of the other couple did but I'm not sure as I wasn't fluent enough in their language.  One partner in each couple was Japanese. 

ETA: I did speak up about the firewood thing, telling them that I had really been looking forward to sitting around the campfire, as that is the highlight of camping. The guy gave a half an apology and a shrug of the shoulders, and the woman seemed pleased it upset me. I didn't tell them what I was really thinking though which I wish I had."
567,"&gt; This is why I think she is in on it. 

""In on it?""  Like this is some kind of *plot?*  That the wife is standing by and coolly allowing her husband to break your heart?

568,"It's related to the comment I responded to. ""My partner and I ogle together all the time."" As if that is a normal, appropriate, benign activity. 

Nice shot at trying to minimize and deflect with the ""needs counseling lolz"" ploy, by the way. Part of my tangent was that the general acceptance of this behavior does in fact lead to many women needing therapy. Your comment rather bolstered my point, don't you think?"

570,"&gt;I feel like it's my problem, not hers, because she's not doing anything wrong

I'm sorry OP but what your mother did *was* wrong and her continued insistence at having a 'sister' relationship with you *is* wrong. You need to go to therapy to learn how to set boundaries with her and also encourage her to get therapy as well.

Is your mother a little slow, or did she perhaps have you at a young age? I ask because I had my daughter as a teenager, and then kept her in the abusive relationship I was in with her bio father until she was 3. By the time I recovered emotionally from that and began to adult like a normal person, I was in my early 20s. But by then my daughter was 6 years old, and I had been leaning on her emotionally unfortunately. My daughter is very, very bright and she did tell me then how she felt about it and luckily I had enough sense to have had us both in therapy, as well as enough sense to listen to older adults who told me to stop treating her like a miniature adult and let her just be a kid. I didn't even know better, but I learned. Even still my daughter had a hard time recovering from her early childhood, to my everlasting regret. 

But she did and now in her 20s has a happy life. I don't think she would have if she hadn't been able to talk to me as an *adult* about the stress she felt as a child from having to listen to me and be burdened by adult issues and stresses. So I encourage you to talk to your mother about this, really have it out with her. She's going to feel hurt but she's your mom and she can bear it. You need to get this out and she needs to hear it and take responsibility for the harm she caused you as a child. Then your relationship can heal and you both can move forward with a true mother-daughter relationship."
571,"haha thank you, honestly yeah breaking out the popcorn and watching this shitshow unfold is probably the only thing I can do, and the betting pool is a very good idea...."
572,"Ugh, that's so frustrating. She needs to get some better emotional tools for her anger rather than just using you as a punching bag."
573,"I just want to let you know, as a third-party and newcomer to yours and /u/PlainTruthiness's discussion, that your mindset is pretty preposterous, here. 

&gt; I said they both should have been more clear on their expectations. 

OP was clear. FWB lied to OP with regularity about what she wanted and her feelings for him, apparently. 

&gt; To you, it seems to be something like
FWB = a purely sexual relationship where you're not allowed to ask anything else from your partner, ever.
However, my definition would be more like
FWB = a purely sexual relationship where you agree to deal with future problems (for example, but not limited to, feelings) if they occur in a spirit of mutual respect and friendship. This is a far more realistical (sic) option in my mind because it's life, and shit happens.

That's totally crazy and both of those ""definitions"" are ridiculous. Your definition is... just gibberish, honestly. Makes no sense. 

**FWB = a friend that you fool around with**. That's it. That's the extent/definition of a FWB relationship. It's a friendship with added benefits. The added benefit is having sex, as that's not usually part of a regular friendship between people. 

&gt; can you maybe see why it is a good idea to be specific at the start when defining the relationship

OP was very specific. ""I don't want a relationship and I'm **seeing** other people"". Meaning that there was no chance, then or ever in the future, that OP and FWB would enter into a relationship, and that OP is actively seeing other people. There's no way he could have been more clear than that. 

You and FWB seem to be very similar; thinking ""Oh, OP said this but he must *actually* mean (insert something totally different despite all the evidence to the contrary)"".

Just because you/FWB don't believe/understand/comprehend someone when they **explicitly** tell you something (like ""I am not interested in a relationship""), doesn't mean that OP is the one in the wrong, or that OP didn't communicate clearly. He did. FWB just didn't believe him.

579,"You cannot force her to do something that she does not want to do. 

The only person you have power over in this situation is yourself.  If dealing with her crises is damaging your life, and she has repeatedly said that she does not want to actually do anything to resolve those crises, then what you have to do is remove yourself from the situation.

As the saying goes, you are not required to set yourself on fire to keep others warm.

The fact that you were ""actually"" wanting to go down on her and that you ""surprisingly"" enjoy massaging her body don't change it from you being butthurt about not getting sex that particular night.

It's not rare to find men who enjoy giving pleasure to woman (or vice-versa), as much as pop culture makes it sound like such men are unicorns who need to be worshipped.

Aside from all that, I really wonder what you were expecting when you wanted to call her and hash out your problems. How would you expect that conversation to go? Her apologizing and admitting you're right? Her explaining her POV and you agreeing?"
582,This is the start of an abusive relationship. None of what you are posting is remotely okay.

584,"Lying by omission. Deciding not to tell her something in order to avoid a reaction from her. That's not how healthy relationships work.

588,"You say you're up until 3 or 4am.  Honest question: what are you doing?  I get insomnia, too.  But sleep hygiene stuff (not meds--made me all fuzzy) helped.

I hope these replies have helped you evaluate how unreasonable your perspective is, because I get the feeling that you're probably just as entitled in other parts of your family life.  And that sucks for your wife way more than getting up early to parent both of her children. "

There's a lot more wrong here. She gets angry and you get passive-aggressive and neither of you actually get anywhere. "

Your wife has broken your bones. She is physically abusing you and you don't know what do??? The answer is obvious: **leave her and get a divorce**

No one deserves to be beaten. Full stop. It's awful that your wife is doing this to you. You sound broken down and not even cognizant that you are a victim of domestic abuse.

As for her being a farm girl, not sure what the hell that has to do with anything. Even if she was 5 feet tall she could still cause you grave bodily harm and even kill you. You don't think women have killed their partners before? All it takes is a knife, OP. Weapons make anyone lethal and she has shown a pattern of using violence towards you in anger. Hell, she could poison your food or cut the brakes of your car. Listen, stop buying into the gender stereotype because you're bigger than her that she's no threat, that you should take abuse, etc. *That's what she wants you to believe*. Abusers condition their victims into a state of helplessness. Rise above this programming OP.

You took the first steps of coming out of this fog by posting here. Now it's time to confide about your situation to someone you trust in your life. A brother, a sister, a good friend or even your boss. You shouldn't spend another minute carrying this burden alone.

###Tell someone you know OP

Don't delay."

595,I served in the military. Deployed twice to Iraq and Afghanistan. Using PTSD as a reason to cheat is bullshit. People like him shouldn't even be in the military.

597,"I know that I would confront my father about it, but it's really a matter of opinion. The real question is...is it going to help anything if I do? What is your goal in confronting your father about this?"
598,"Thank you. I do see some parallels in our stories - my girlfriend also feels that I helped pull her out of a place of bad mental health.

I don't have anything else to add, but I appreciate your advice."
599,"Maybe you should be home less. And if they ask why, give a honest answer.

&gt;*Some wacko on the internet told me to be home less.*"

Sorry, everything else you said seemed important, but...wait, what?"
601,AND it sounds like he was going to have his son lie about it to save him from an argument but his son is just too gosh darn honest.
602,I practice kink. This shit wouldn't be OK with me.
603,It's only been 6 months.  You have no idea what he's going to do.
604,Then what exactly is your question?  You don't want the same things and she's too young for you.  It's unlikely you are going to find a woman in her 20's who is on the same page.
605,"He's such a scumbag OP. So sorry. 
Before you email shit to his family, is there any benefit to *not* burning bridges with his parents? Can grandma and grandpa help you and the kids out at alll? Maybe it's time to call his mum. "
606,"1. She's not your girlfriend. You are broken up.

2. It's not your business who she's kissing or where anymore. How do you even know that she's making out in a car anyhow?

Cut contact as best you can. Block from all social media and your phone. Avoid her in person as best you can. Distract yourself with hobbies. This will fade away with time."
607,"Uh huh. I'm sorry, but you're not going to convince me that you're really just that clueless and have no idea what the problem is. Maybe some other guy will get your girlfriend some extravagant, beautiful gift and she can tell you that its just what she told him she wanted. And you can watch her wear it everyday too."
608,"&gt; I don't know what exactly you do for work, but people in my office get packages and letters all the time

Some places that's ok, some places it's not. For example, if you work a job that's funded by government, having personal mail and packages sent to your workplace can be considered an improper use of government resources."
609,"Dude you're 24. This is some 16-year-old shit. Grow a pair and break up with her.

&gt;i have noone else

Wonder why when you're soo good looking and women are fawning all over you. Must be something to do with your personality"
610,"NO. Enough, forget the document and stop talking to this guy. No contact. "
611,"&gt;In order to compensate for that, I buy groceries (on our weekends) and said since I bought the groceries, you (you being the boyfriend) cook and wash the dishes. 

Wow, what a shitty mentality. I am blown away that someone would even come up with that. If that's how you think, maybe you should simply alternate which place you spend the week-end at or eat separately. You say he is able to cover his own expenses, even if barely. Have you even taken the time to ask him what would be satisfactory in his mind?

FYI, for most people, if someone cooks, the other will do the dishes.

&gt;Started telling me how I am selfish and all kinds of stuff... I never ask you for anything and the first time I do its a problem

At first, I thought he was in the wrong for the car incident but reading the rest of the story, I wonder if it's true. You've mentioned a lot of things he does for you but nothing you do for him. So how true is it?

&gt; If you think I should leave let me know. 

You don't seem to care a lot for him or respect him a lot so I think you should leave. Maybe find a man with more means who can give you the lavish courting you are used to."
612,"I'm kinda getting the feeling that either they're getting student loans--and that situation will change, the FAFSA will change, after a wedding!--or their parents are paying for it."
613,"I'm named after my mum's childhood dog. The dog was male and I am not. Other than it being a bit of a family joke with mum always protesting ""I really loved that dog!"", it's really not a big deal to me. "
614,"autism or not, he will eventually be a grown man in society and if your parents don't teach him that he can't do that even though its mainly due to his autism, he is going to get in big trouble in the future."
615,"&gt; What? Why is Michelle trying to get you to talk to your sister when it was her own boys who messed up?

Because Michelle has been shirking responsibility her entire life.

I know I only have a mere glimpse into her life right now, but it seems to fit - underparented children growing into undisciplined brats, no obvious punishment given to the kids, and then pawning off the 'making up' to an ininvolved third party so she doesn't have to put any real effort into making amends for her lifetime of avoiding real parenting."
616,"So let me get this straight:

1. He gave you the information pertinent to you
2. You wanted all of the information, including the stuff that doesn't involve you
3. When he said no, you pouted and called him names
4. You are frustrated when he responds in kind and defends his position

Sounds like you are the one over the top, especially since YOU started the fight, the name calling and are now calling him abusive."
617,"You are 100% right. I appreciate your thoughtful advice. I think this is the best way to handle this in a way that is compassionate for all parties involved.

Thank you so much. "
618,"Why are you pissed at them? You could have salvaged it all if you had left. If they made the first racist comment, and you stood up, and said ""That is absolutely unacceptable and racist. I will not sit here and allow you to speak that way in my presence, EVER, about ANYONE."" You could still be with your boyfriend. Your grandparents did not mess this up - you knew EXACTLY who they were. 

You are 100% responsible here. Being pissed at your family feels good because it deflects the blame off you, but this is your fault, and you are not ready for a relationship with a man you are not willing to defend to your family. 

I hope you treat your next boyfriend with more kindness and respect."
619,"This is petty. 
You've only been together for 5 months so unless he's a mind reader I highly doubt he would have picked something much better, this is probably why he took you to pick it yourself so he could get an idea of what style you're into etc. 

Again you've only been together for 5 months and he let you pick out an expensive piece of jewelry, to me, this just sounds materialistic and petty. "
620,I felt like 15-18 were incredibly hard and long. I'm 31 now and the years have gone by quicker the older I've gotten. 
621,"You're correct, there was another, and there seemed to be something off about that boyfriend."
622,"Wait, are you saying that communicating with people works, and not all people are just narcissistic brick walls that you need to cut off? Huh."
623,"Totally.

The kid was also like 13 though, so I am not holding it against him. "
624,[removed]
625,"I wonder whether the girlfriend still wore the high school necklace. As an adult woman, I don't wear any of my teen era pieces. They're too small, delicate and girly -- they're not appropriate for the woman I've become. Perhaps the GF felt the same way. It's possible she would have preferred something more suited to her age/maturity. "
626,"Oh man, this is similar to an experience I had in my mid 20's.  Was with the girl for 4 years, lived together for 2.  We were great for each other in a lot of ways but we fought all the time (nothing physical).  The final year of the relationship I found myself sleeping separately in the extra bedroom probably 90% of the time.  We'd make up for a week here and there but the calm never lasted.  We both wanted to get married, we both loved each other deeply, we were very close to eloping on several of the ""good"" weeks.  

The final year we moved to a new city on the other side of the country, 2800 miles from where I grew up and where my support system was located.  I wish I had a friend like you that would have seen the signs and given it to me straight. I may not have taken it to heart but the seeds would have planted.  You are on the right side of this situation even if he does not see it that way right now.

Luckily for me I sort of had an awaking moment and realized this woman was not the person I wanted to spend my life with.  I realized I couldn't imagine sleeping in a separate bedroom for the rest of my life.  I begrudgingly realized that marriage was not going to fix our problems, but this realization was almost an accident.  I think I was very close to making the wrong decision, looking back it really could have gone either way.  You bringing this up may be just what he needs to push him to this realization, even if it takes him a while longer to arrive at it. 

At the time I thought that it was mostly normal for people to do this.  I didn't know that further down the road I would be in a great relationship where these situations never happen.  I have been with my current wife for over 5 years, and have never once slept in the extra bedroom.  It almost seems upsurd that I once thought the fights and sleeping arrangements in my previous relationship was normal.  

There's a better life out there for your buddy, you're doing the right thing by trying to help him see that.  "

628,"&gt;Discovered that my spouse of 10 years, with three young kids (all under 10), has been cheating for a number of months with a coworker of hers.

An affair *for a number of months* that **you had to discover**. That's **not good** and, *IMO*, impossible to come back from. 

You seem to want to try - and fair enough. That said, you need to accept the **very real** possibility that the damage she's done has cratered the relationship permanently. If you cannot re-establish trust after something like a year, you **need** to give up the relationship before the damage effects everything else in your life. 

&gt;We've reached out for counselling already, but unsure how to handle the days till then. Should I stay in the same room, leave the house, tell her to leave? 

That's up to you, I suppose. I'm not sure **how you expect** to pretend to be normal. *Things are not normal*, no matter how hard you pretend. You might as well accept that fact and go from there. If, after accepting it, you decide that her being in the same bedroom as you is fine, then go ahead. I would not tell the kids everything, but I would not pretend things were fine. I would tell them that mommy and daddy have to work through some issues and I would reassure them, repeatedly, that you all still love them.

&gt; I've confronted the cheater. Should I tell the other cheating person's spouse? Trying to balance desire for revenge/unknown impact 

Well, *she works with him*, so is she going to find a new job? If it were me, I would tell the other spouse because *they should know* **who their spouse really is** and not just believe who they pretend to be.

&gt; I see people say lawyer up. Why would one get a lawyer before trying counselling?

It doesn't hurt to go see a lawyer and the lawyer would tell you, legally, what your options are. You need to know them. 

&gt;Any suggestions on questions I should ask to ensure we go into counselling more prepared? 

I'd just be honest and I'd expect honesty. I'd also expect that your wife is willing to give 110% to this effort. If you want transparency, then she should give it. "
629,"Why are you waiting? He *nearly killed your fucking child*. He got so drunk he took the child out of the cot, put them down, and then fell asleep while you were locked out of the house.

Pick your child up, get in the car, and *fucking leave*. It doesn't matter where or who you stay with just GO. GET OUT. Pull out as much money as you can, grab your valuables, *GO.* Worst case you can go to the police and ask for help to get to a woman's shelter."
630,I second this. Tell the fucking spouse she DESERVES TO KNOW
631,Anyone who emotionally manipulates you is not a great person. You're being wilfully blind to his faults because you're scared to be alone.
632,"Did tom know about any of this with her? If not he has a pass there... as for her I mean look at it cut and dry. You both admitted mutual feelings and literally hours later she hops in another guys bed and fucks him. You don't want any of that. 

Be glad you had this happen at the very start and not during some fleshed out relationship 

If you want you can still talk to Tom about all of this friend to friend and hash it out instead of awkward timid looking for approval bs"
633,Probably because they are old.
634,"This was the first time the topic of finding other people attractive has ever come up in our relationship, aside from comments from either of us saying 'he/she looks good' about a friend of ours or something. There was no previous reaction; this is the first one. Sorry if that wasn't clear."
635,"&gt;Well I wasn't there to see it and you weren't either!

Your sister sure was, though, and whatever happened was enough for her not to want your kid in her house.

The picture emerging from your post and subsequent comments is that your son is a brat and you refuse to correct his misbehavior, but you expect your sister to cater to you *in her house*. That's pretty galling."
636,"&gt; I think they might be jealous because they don't have good luck with guys?

That would be my guess."
637,"If he doesnt get hints, stop giving him hints. Be blunt. If you want it as a gift, tell him youd like him to get it for you as a gift. You want to kiss him? Dont lean in half way, plant one on him. You want attention, tell him. Hints can ruin great relationships."
638,"When someone says they're ""not ready for a relationship"" they always mean they're not ready for a relationship *with you*. Just move on."
639,Take the old job back and move!
640,"&gt;Send them a postcard. ""Best wishes from Dr and wife""

OMG I actually cackled. "
641,"If he has autism, you could also call DPPC (Disabled Persons Protection Commission). They will ask your name, but you can choose to remain anonymous. They will investigate and help get him access to appropriate services, or perhaps even alternate living arrangements. "
642,"He said that my mom basically cut all ties with him, and that many years ago he tried contacting her and she didn't respond. 

I fully agree that I may never know the entire truth. I'll just have to be adult about it and make my own decisions. That's life I suppose :)"
643,It took me so so long to realize this. Normal people who love each other don't yell when there is a dispute 
644,"About the only excuse for this is that people behave in weird ways in a crisis, but quite honestly it seems you have a fiance who doesn't trust you (follows you round and doesn't like you having independence)

&gt; He was out of place to follow me around, but I am used to it.

That's one problem. Instead of accepting it, you have to stop stuff like this immediately before it becomes a big issue.

&gt;  He is struggling with his work and finances

And yet he took time off to go with you.

&gt; he says that I like to ""always be the victim""

How he can say that after you had a miscarriage and his drama show at a dinner is beyond me. Look up ""gaslighting""

tl;dr; why haven't you kicked him out? "
645,"Learning another language in an actual physical classroom is a great way to meet people too, particularly other people going through the same experience of adjusting to a new country. OP, if you have the means, stop purely studying at home and get yourself into a classroom.

edit: my Japanese school also had a lot of cultural elements like tours and festivals, and also gateways to a lot of programs like one where you speak English with young kids to sort of adjust them to native speakers early on. So if you can find a good language school it can really open a lot of doors."
646,Yea there is something about this that feels more concerning than actually cheating...
647,"Oh wow, two days before is soooo different to one.

It's not like people plan Christmas months in advance or anything.

I am not saying she is going to be arrested. But she can expect to be shunned and justly so."
648,[deleted]
649,"&gt; I haven't told him anything

Your boyfriend is not psychic. He does not know the extent of how you are feeling. Unless you tell him you are having an emotional meltdown and that you need him by your side, he will not know that. Relationships only succeed when both people communicate their needs to each other. You need to communicate your needs to him. Only then will he understand what is being asked of him. If you hide your feelings but hold it against him, then yes, you're being an asshole."
650,"I think you need to sit down with him and really delve into what ""isn't ready yet"" means.  Is it financial?  Does he think he's to young to ""settle down""?  Is there some fear or worry that is holding him back?  Does he think things will change after marriage in a negative way?  Etc.

Can he give you some kind of timeline to when he would be ready to propose.  What things need to happen for him to be ready?  

He also needs to not get hung-up on it being a surprise.  The actual time and place can be a surprise, but the engagement should not be.  

As for you, I think you need to also consider if this is the situation you really want to commit to or if you are pushing for an engagement because it's the next step.  It sounds like you are unhappy with your current living situation, but put up with it because you love him.  Is that how you want to continue?  Will you be okay with this in 5 or 10 years?  Can you be happy where you are or are you going to resent him?  It already sounds like you have resentments building up.  Also, he doesn't sound like he's very open when it comes to communication.  I think that should be a main priority if you are going to get married.  Premarital counseling is a must.  It's a good idea for pretty much every couple, but when there are communication issues, it's critical.  "
651,"I mean, I wouldn't stay with someone who screamed at me and thought I was an idiot.

100% commission jobs exist and aren't necessarily scams/pyramid schemes, so if you're sure the company you're working for is legitimate (I assume you did your research), then I think it's disrespectful that he doesn't trust you. And *even if it is a scam,* screaming and calling you an idiot isn't the way to handle that. "
652,"Hey babe, you know those procedures I wanted but you said you were against? Well, I went and did it anyway...Surprise!

I don't see how that would go well."
653,"German Keyboard, sry."
654,"&gt;Sex drugs booze, but no need to spell that out to mom

Maybe he *should* spell that out to mom? I'm sure if he spelled out what happens in college, and then re-iterates that he'll be 16 around all of it, it might make mom think twice.
"
655,"I started at a university at 16. It's really not a big deal, nobody assumes I'm young and I never give them a reason to do so. Just act like every other college student ever and go with it.

Any younger and I think people may have caught on (and I honestly wouldn't have wanted to do any younger), but to 99% of other people I'm just that guy in thermo, not that 17-year-old in thermo. My closer friends know but all that does is set up the occasional joke."
656,"He doesn't have to like him, he just has to be polite to him. Just because you are choosing to marry him doesn't mean your family automatically loves him. Plus, he's thirteen. I hated my own brother when I was thirteen, just cause I was a brat. "
657,"No kidding. If someone has that little respect for my privacy and right to autonomy then hell no, I do not want to be in a relationship, let alone a marriage. "
658,Why do you feel she is owed any money?
659,"You really need to end this. She also deserves better, someone who is enthusiastic about being with her. 

Learning to be single and alone without being lonely can be a long road, but it's an amazing gift to give yourself. 

Edit: if she threatens suicide, call 911/your local equivalent."
660,"You obviously have BPD. You have pushed him too far. Instead of trying to make it up to him, you need to keep working on your own self improvement strategies. 

Keep working through the reasons why you keep placing this emotional burden on other people to make you feel loveable. How can they make you feel what you don't believe ? Why should others believe you to be loveable if YOU don't believe it's true ? Sending loaded texts &amp; placing expectations on others to provide you soothing answers, expecting people to read your mind...this is all super unhealthy behaviour.

Basically - Work on loving yourself &amp; the rest of the pieces will fall in place the way they're meant to &amp; lay off the emotionally charged texts ! "
661,Sorry why is Jane your second choice?
662,"""She also tries to lift my clothing up while I'm asleep.""

That's sexual abuse. Because you're eighteen, you'd call the cops rather than CPS, but I think it would be less traumatic to move out. Stay with a friend for a bit while you find your ground. Apply to jobs every day, talk to everyone you know about getting work. "
663,"I confess, I skimmed the last two thirds of this, because the first few paragraphs make it clear that:

- He's not really a very nice or considerate person.

- You don't have a very healthy relationship with each other.

- He's not good at being honest or communicating.

- His mother is always going to be a problem in your relationship if she's already interfering this much.

Just ditch his ass. He keeps making it clear that he doesn't want you to feel happy, secure and comfortable with him if it means there's any threat whatsoever to him being able to do whatever he likes.

Move on. Find someone who actually *wants* to be in a relationship with you."
664,"I get this 100%, but he wasn't asking before they walked into a party when he couldn't change. That's when you swallow any criticism and tell them they look great. He was wearing a wrinkled shirt that didn't fit before he even left for work. That's an okay time to say, ""what about this one? It's not really wrinkled and looks hot on you."""
665,Would the leggings be the right size for him? Maybe he is crossdressing?
666,"No, but he did immediately blame her for not hugging him enough and suggest that she should've put herself in harms way to stop him. That is a red flag."
667,"Alcohol isn't really an excuse. It doesn't make you forget your boyfriend. And it doesn't force you to screw a guy from work. 

Will you ever be able to trust her again? If not, don't get back with her. "
668,":'''''''D If the answer to that question involves the word ""half"" something is very wrong. "
669,"Responding after your updates:

Stay the course. Go to your dad's with your sister. That wasn't a ""joke"" and they are bullies. 

"
670,"Holy crap, lady. You want to know if he texted you, but you don't want to ask if he texted you. You want him to know your phone is broken and that's why you haven't responded, but you don't want to tell him that. You want him to ask you out (do you? I actually can't tell), but you don't want to ask him out, or even let him know you're open to being asked out. You want him to know everything that's going on with you, but you don't want to talk to him AT ALL as far as I can tell! 

Oh, and you don't want anything to be ""awkward"". 

You know what's awkward? Giving someone your number and *never bringing it up again or explaining why he didn't hear from you.*

You know what's not awkward? *Speaking to your coworker like a normal human being.*

What do you want out of all this? To just avoid the attention of all human beings as much as possible? To stay as deep within your comfort zone as possible? Or do you want to go out with this dude?"
671,"So she never gets to sleep in for the rest of her life, because of his work schedule? Not that he can take a nap on his day off? One night of ~6 hours' sleep a week is not going to have any ""sleep deprivation"" effects. Come on."
672,"Not only will she want him clean-shaven, but probably a million other unreasonable things as well.  "
673,"It doesn't sound like that's the case here, though. "
674,"Isn't that kind of an odd leap to make, given that OP didn't post a picture?"
675,"You spent two years with the guy, you are engaged to be married to him, and you never ever had the opportunity to mention your past? It's not only lying by omission. You had to go through great lengths to never show him childhood pictures of you, alter your depictions of your childhood/teenagehood to him, have your friends who knew you from that period lie to him too (or simply never meeting him), etc. 

There must have been a lot of work going into that. There is no way it can be a case ""Oops, I did it again. I forgot to mention something to him."" You never told him what it felt growing up feeling like your body doesn't express the gender you are, what it was like to go through gender reassignation, having your parents disown you, the whole transgender experience.

It is more than ""I used to look like a girl"". It's a big web of lies and deception you spun out of him. He didn't necessarily leave because he was weirded out, more like he realized he didn't even know who it was going to marry. He must feel hurt and betrayed and lost, and rightfully so. He doesn't want to see you now. Let him be until he is ready to face you if he ever gets ready to. "
676,"That only applies to accidentally literally shitting yourself, not figuratively shitting where you eat.

He made an ass of *himself*. He earned that ridicule."
677,"^ this. It may feel good to blow off steam but that is going to bite you in the ass in the long run. She got preggers - ok something a lot of collage and university students do. We have a DAYCARE at our campus for mom's who are attending post-secondary education. And this isn't exactly the middle of nowhere this is TORONTO. Apparently the school felt that there was a demand for one enough to build it including a jungle gym for the kids outside. 

If she stays mad then her sister won't listen to anything she says and will be inclined to do something more dangerous than give the child up for an adoption. This is the time to form a alliance if OP is at all interested in helping her sister. Not acting out. "
678,"I only ever read stuff here, but I had to post this. 

Please do it. My favourite memories are of the days I spent with just my mom and me. She passed away just a couple of months to go, and this really reminded me of those days. Just do it because someday you won't be able to ever again. Someday you will forget all about your brothers' teasing, but you will never forget the time you spent with your mom."
679,"GOD no, they really, really don't."
680,"&gt;  which is still valid affirmative consent.

Bullshit.

The entire *point* of affirmative consent is that it is clear, unambiguous, and cannot be misunderstood. ""Body Language is still valid affirmative consent"" is how you get raped by someone who thought you were into it."

682,"I'm friends with a couple who think giving gifts to each other for christnas(when they are married DINKS with lots of disposable income)is lame. 

But they both agree and feel that way, and there's no expectation for a gift. 

Your bf is just being terrible and lazy. "
683,"While you're right that he wants to ask questions, anything dealing with the coworker and the car is a dead end. It'll just make her defensive when there's potentially nothing to be defensive about. More  importantly, he doesn't know anything about that part of it. There's nothing saying the coworker ever entered the apartment or did anything more than simply drive up and pick her up in work clothes...probably to go to work. 

Best to focus on what OP does know, get the girlfriend to stitch together the missing pieces, then decide if that makes sense to him and move onto asking more questions."
684,"Totally understand and I know. All I want to do is keep from losing my job over the comment. Should I apologize for offending them or just let it go? 

I have never been good at fitting in so the outsider thing is fine and normal to me. I have good friends and a good personal life outside of work. I just want to make sure I don't face someone yelling at me or firing me at the office."
685,"You know what - moving things around and measuring seems way more likely than cheating to me. That's why there is nothing there. It will be delivered or taken there on the day. 

That is way more likely than her taking a guy there to bang at her bfs place for an hour and a half while his dog barked. "
686,"He has a job and some money I assume, if he doesn't have his work provided housing he can stay in a hotel or hostel for the week"
687,I certainly wouldn't want pictures of myself from any of my hospital trips on facebook. And OP doesn't want to tell his sister what is going on.
688,"Yeah, I'm with the boyfriend on this one - he actually sounds like an amazing guy. I bet a lot of men in the same situation would've handled that less gracefully, but instead of lashing out at her and actually comparing her to his ex, he made a sarcastic remark on how she can still be happy without spending an hour doing her makeup. Toning it down would mean less makeup to get smeared all over his clothes and she wouldn't be late. Win-win."
689,This is the most helpful comment I have received so far. Thank you!
690,THIS!! Everyone KNOWS how much they earn because it will tell you on the sheet and in order to get money back or pay back taxes they go based off the income. Something seems VERY fishy to me. The only excuse is if he got his taxes and ran down to the tax office without looking at the sheet but even then when you go down to the tax office they talk to you about your taxes.

695,"Best advice i have seen here, your trapped at the moment, get your shit together and make a plan. 2 years at a community college and you will be able to get a job that pays enough to support you  and your child, he will have to pay support.

Borderlines are characterized by a push/pull, where in they push you away (for fear of abandonment, as /u/LucyAndDiamonds said above), and later pull you in.  Sounds like you're in the push away phase.  

They know all the buttons to push in their children (they installed them), so recognizing it is step 1.  You may want to seek a counselor who specializes in BPD to work with to learn how to establish boundaries as you move forward.  It's hard to do.  "

707,"&gt;I know when there's something wrong with him

He has cheated on you and you caught him filming your sister. The thing that is wrong with him is that he is married to you but sexually pursuing other women...now including your sister. Don't make excuses for him."

711,"Please leave the health concerns to health care professionals. Health isn't something you can generally just know by observation--unless of course you were referring to things like temporal wasting, jaundice, poor dentition, distress, toxicity. But you weren't. Being obese comes with health risks, this is true---but many of those risks can be mitigated by an individuals medications and lifestyle.  Some can't. Many thin people have these same health risks because of other factor. 

Also, trust me, patients probably don't want to hear how fat they are from their peers all the time (hint:they already know!). Also, you may be surprised to know that overweight/mild obesity can be a protective factor for certain health problems. Seriously."

713,"Are you poly?

Because this sounds like you are in an emotionally polyamorous relationship--and she's the primary partner.

**You need to set boundaries.**  Tell your BF that the next time his sister calls while you are over at his place, you will only wait a few minutes for him to politely end the conversation.  After, say, five-seven minutes, you are going home.

**And then go home.**

You'll have to do this a couple of times, because BF won't believe you.  And you'll find that the conversations are suddenly REALLY IMPORTANT and that the sister is in CRISIS and needs help!!!!  (The sister will totally have all kinds of crises.  All the crises in the world.)

When she invites herself on a trip?  You don't go.  Inevitably, the issue will be pushed and you won't be given any advance warning:  you'll pull up to BF's house and there she is!  A last second addition to your trip!

You get back into your car and go home.

The point here is that your BF has to choose which woman he wants to pursue a life with.  If after you set boundaries, he's still trying to prioritize sis?  Well, you've got your answer about the future of this relationship..."

723,"Yeah there's got to be a lot going on here that you're not telling us. If you've been an absolute trustworthy angel in all ways then your girlfriend would be way out of line telling you to stop talking to that girl in the first place. If you'd been an angel then one broken promise to not message that girl doesn't seem enough to justify your girlfriend having access to your stuff. But I'm thinking maybe you're no angel. 

&gt; Since we moved in together she has been very restrictive of my time

You know who's restrictive of people's time? A 4 month old baby. Are you concerned about the restrictions on your girlfriends time?   Cause she's probably got restrictions that would make your head spin.

&gt; [she] wants me to spend every second with her, it's causing me to fall behind on my university course

Are you saying that she demands you skip class to stay home with her? Does she not let you do your homework or studying when you are at home?

&gt; I'm getting depressed with not being able to do anything for myself.

You know who doesn't let people do anything for themselves? 4 month old babies, that's who. 

&gt; I got on my bike and drove the hour ride home

From where? School? Work? It's gotta be one of those, right? You should probably move closer, an hour one way is a long commute and is probably effecting your studies. 

&gt; Now she wants me to give her my phone so she can look through everything and also to give over control of my bank account as she doesn't trust my spending. I always have money left over, and always pay our bills early.

Oh well if you've got money 'left over', then what's she worried about? I'm sure you're putting all the left over in savings and must have a nice little emergency fund in place by now. And you pay the bills early? Like you mean you've pre-paid for example the electricity for the next 12 months? Or do you mean that you make sure to send the payments in before the due date, because that's not really 'paying them early' that's just paying them on time. 

And oh yeah? Does your girlfriend have a car? Cuz you know who likes cars? 4 month old babies. "

726,"&gt; I think he overreacted and can be too sensitive but that can be a discussed in general at a later time I suppose.

Yeah, true.  Here's a possible suggestion - if either of you have time on your lunch breaks, can you run to the store and pick up some Downy Wrinkle Releaser or something?  It doesn't get the same crisp pressed look of ironing, but holy crap that stuff can work some miracles.  "

736,"It sounds to me like they would have actively wanted OP to participate and feel comfortable, and would have made this happen if they'd known in advance.  But the way OP's boyfriend handled it, this was pretty much impossible.  

Sure, they're going to be mad about how their own original plans were disrupted, but I think odds are pretty good that what would make them feel worse is not being able to include OP fully, and that now it's maybe their fault OP feels bad.

And one other thing to that point: Surely this isn't the first time the BF has pulled something along these lines with his other friends.  Probably not as intense as this - probably just with smaller things.  They know how he is.  And knowing how he is, I think they won't be holding it against OP."
737,"Geeze, op you've got a good head on your shoulders. Focus on you. I hope you do stop being the mediator. Your sister is old enough to figure her shit out.

If she really wanted to be with you she should at least have the decency to break it off with him first. Even if you guys got together then you'd likely lose your friendship. 

My advice? Find someone you like who's not in a relationship already.  Limit your contact with Jen because she's basically emotionally cheating at this point. "

Look, I wasn't there, and I believe you, but you admitted to slapping her once, and even if justified, the reality of the situation is one of you going to jail if you don't break up NOW.

751,"&gt;What do I do?

If you want to break the cycle, Take action! It's clear that she is too invested in this guy to consider your feelings, so the only way out is through. Anything you do will be hard, but it is likely to hurt less in the long run. I see several potential options:

- Ask her to move out and set a specific timeframe. Don't move out yourself - whatever your flaws, you're not the one who strayed. Give her a month's notice - that's plenty of time to find a room somewhere. She might go for this as it'll give her somewhere nicer than the back of a van to meet her new fancyman.

- It's obvious that she's no longer your partner in any meaningful sense, just a roommate you share assorted responsibilities with. If you have the mental fortitude, start treating her like a stranger you share a house with. Split the bills, sleep in seperate beds and stick to minimal interaction.

- If you want to go the spiteful route and think her new guy may also be cheating, you can try and contact his spouse. Living with an ex happens, but in the long term it's unusual, so you're probably right. If you do this, there's a very high chance he'll cut abandon his sidepiece to try and save his real relationship. This potentially leaves her with nothing. Either way, his home life's not really any of your business, but I'd want to know.  Cheaters cheat, so with two of them it's a ticking time bomb of a relationship."
752,"We have an open adoption where all of this is written out in regards to expectation. None of it is enforceable but they don't tell you that when you're a kid. Shoot, I signed away all rights to him before I was old enough to vote or drink or get a loan. It was the right thing. And I understand that. I'm not even opposed to cutting contact if it's the right thing. But I think that is healthy for him to have his birthparents in his life, plus this is the routine he has had his whole life."
753,"I've been on the receiving end of long-term idealised attachment like this:

 
1) I don't think you're a creep and if you haven't acted in any way creepy, there's nothing immoral about how you're feeling.


2) it's not hugely active, but /r/limerence is the place for you. Go do some reading about limerence. 


3) you have low self-esteem and likely emotional neglect in your background. Please see a therapist.


4) Have you had other relationships besides her? have some.


5) Do not, as mine did, try and pick your real girlfriends based on their physical resemblance to your LO (Limerent Object). Find women you enjoy spending time with on their own merits, even if that's purely personality-based to begin with.


6) Every time you think about her, consciously remind yourself that you don't actually know her intimately and that she will inevitably be very different to how you perceive her to be. 


7) I can tell you that if she ever develops feelings for you in the future, doing 4 is going to make her feel like you were doing 'trial runs' and that her own awareness of how fundamentally human and therefore flawed she is compared to your idealised perception of her means that she probably won't even be able to match up to one of your trial run girlfriends, as they got cut the slack of not being Her and just looking like Her. It's overwhelming, and sabotages your chances before you even get into actual dating.


8) as a lurker in /r/limerence, two things frequently crop up:
- you are projecting qualities you wish you had on to your LO, and should try and self-improve in these areas
- you are turning all interactions with her into a gamble for reciprocated attention, which is channelling your human need for excitement into places it shouldn't be going. Every time you feel the need to do this, go do some risk-taking in a positive and productive way somewhere else. 

**TL;DR:** take a step back from spending time with her, and work on yourself. Please get a therapist, try and become the best version of yourself, and develop connections to other people.

I know you've said you came here to talk to people, but I don't think focusing on her is a good thing - you should try and re-direct your thoughts every time. I think when you do something like this, find new audiences to share about her with, you are trying to get a new rush to sustain the emotional investment you've already made. "
754,"This is actually a wonderful ""filter"" for people you're dating. Not the fact that they're calling you pet names - but their reaction when you tell them you don't like it.

If someone calls you honey (or whatever), don't cross their name off the list. Confront them. If they call you up-tight, stupid or ridiculous, **then** cross them off the list. If they understand your preference and adjust accordingly - congratulations! You just found someone who actually gives a shit about what you like and don't like and appreciates constructive criticism.

Will the majority not get past this filter because people are stubborn? Possibly. But then again, the world isn't littered with perfect partners. Treat this as an opportunity to find the ones who actually care."

I obviously don't know him as well as you, but from the outside looking in, he seems like a very petty, angry, and inconsiderate person. I just hope you think about that and consider if this person actually cares about your well-being. Because, if he doesn't, why are you with him? "

767,"The difference here is that you've been to the doctor and *ruled out* all of these other things. With the extremely limited information that we have as readers, it's impossible to state what she has or doesn't have, and going to a doctor would at least let her rule out what it isn't. What if she does have sleep apnea (for example), and this could have been settled last year?

Or like you, unfortunately there's no real diagnosis but she could be doing DBT/CBT or meditation. I'm definitely not saying that doctors are the be-all and end-all for sleep issues - like you said it's still an extremely hard thing to deal with medically - but until she goes to a doctor she can't rule out any of the treatable conditions."

I'm in my late 30s and even recently I've had both butterfly-type experiences and stable/secure/happy/easy experiences with partners, and I haven't found one to be ""better"" or proof that it will be longer lasting (and sometimes butterflies are actually just the anxiety of not being certain of how someone you like feels about you, not evidence of some cosmic chemical connection). It's just proof that different people connect and relate to each other in different ways. I'd just be looking for good communication/sex/compatibility and go from there. "
769,"It's not sad to want to be liked, almost everyone wants to be liked. I think listening more is spot on; when you're the newcomer in an established group, sometimes a boisterous personality can be a drawback because you disrupt the dynamic.

Pregnancy was mostly fine for me--i was just a bit weepier than usual, but I'm emotional to begin with--but the first two weeks after the baby was born I felt INSANE. Couldn't stop crying over everything and freaking out all the time. And I knew what it was, I knew it was coming and I was prepared for it, and it didn't make a bit of difference.

And that only lasted a few weeks. It's frightening to realize how easily your own personality can be changed out from under you."
773,"You can't ""fix"" him, and you can't make him happy. 

I have MDD (major depressive disorder). I've only just started medication and am waiting for therapy. Your BF's outlook on life sounds exactly, word for word, like mine. My outlook of everything being worthless and miserable has, in the past 8 months, cost me two jobs, my wife, my marriage, access to my son, 4 friends, and a new girlfriend. 

Please recognize the difference between nihilism, a belief that existence has no intrinsic meaning, and so it is up to each individual to wrest their own meaning from life, and depression, which is an inability to perceive any meaning or point or benefit to ANYTHING. Your BF will not change until he is forced to, but something truly horrible will have to happen to him to get him to admit that he needs help. He (and you) are not helped by the modern expectation that men should not really have feelings, and to feel sad and pointless all the time MUST thus equate to being weak. 

If he's open to discussing it, try broaching the subject of depression, and medication and therapy. If he refuses to listen or even entertain the idea, there's nothing you can for him. Decide now if you can live with a man who is chronically depressed. If the answer is ""No,"" (and it probably is, 'cause you're human), then you need to leave. You can tell him why too; maybe it'll be the good swift kick in the pants he needs to go get help. But he needs professional help, and he needs to want it, or he won't stick to it. 

Good luck. "

If I was talking to my SO about up and moving to another country and I was getting it all ready and he was sitting on the sidelines preoccupied with other things, I would be like, hey, are you actually into this or are you just playing along?

Even now, 5 years later, I still think about how wonderful it is that we can spend every day together.

Now of course I'm not saying it will work out that way for you, depends on your personalities I suppose, plus we did see each other every month. But just thought I'd throw my experience into the mix."
783,"You're going to get the same responses as the first time you posted this.  That this is your issue, and that if you want a relationship without this issue, you'll have to date another virgin or someone with the same amount of experience as you.

I think this just means that you aren't ready for a relationship with such a huge age gap.  My fiance is 9 years younger than I am.  He had far less experience than me, but it doesn't bother either of us.  I think you may just need to live your life and gain some more experience to be comfortable with this.  Or get into some individual counselling to understand that you aren't worthless because he didn't wait for you...he didn't even know you, so how could he wait?!"
784,"Did you even read the OP? Homeboy refused to let her hand go after she shook it, forcing them to walk holding hands for 20 seconds. That's not the behavior of someone who respects boundaries."
785,"I think what's happening here is that you're *not* fine about what happened before to you. You're not weak, you're not stupid (internet hug), you've been through something and the feelings you've not addressed are being pointed out by someone who's trying to help. 

Whilst I haven't been through what you've been through, I do know what it's like to push someone away because they make you realise that something else in your life has affected you negatively. I have trouble dealing with feeling sad/angry when I see my extended family who are well-adjusted and good to one another, because all it does is remind me of how absolutely the opposite my immediate family is. I've felt horrible jealousy and pain when they've extended love to me, because of my past. 

I think that's what's happening here. Someone is actually showing you kindness and love and thoughtfulness, and it's making you question yourself. He's not judging you, I don't think; he's telling you ""I love you, and I want YOU to be the one to decide what happens to you. Make yourself and your needs your first priority, because you deserve it."" I get that him putting a name of abuse on your past seems overwhelming, but you are not addressing your past, so he's trying to because he cares. 

You are *not* broken. You are *not* ""making"" him think about these things during sex. I would stop thinking about him and the effect of this on him for a minute and start considering your own feelings. What do *you* want? What do *you* feel?

I think you have to be incredibly brave and address what's going on with a therapist. It'll be hard and horrible at first, but you're holding on to pushing all of this under the carpet, and believe me, I know that that does not work in the long run. You owe yourself happiness and you really, really don't have to live with feeling dirty or disgusting. You're none of those things, OP. 

You have all my internet hugs and best wishes!"

Versus travelling, where he has no control, isn't entirely comfortable, and unaware of what exactly they're able to do.


I mean I'm not saying what he's said and done is correct, right, or even compassionate in any sense. I guess I'm saying is that some people enjoy alone time more than others. If I had the choice, I'd sleep 12 hours a day every day for 2 years straight like I used to. Not that it's healthy, but I liked doing it."
792,"Hey, I am going to come out of my long time lurking for this one-  I am married to a combat vet with PTSD.  If you are going to be in a long term relationship with someone who has combat PTSD, you will have to deal with stuff like this, regardless if they are in therapy or not.  I do recommend therapy, for the record.  It can help a lot.  

When they are having bad ones like this, DO NOT try and wake them up.  I learned that lesson early when we first started dating in a situation like yours when I tried to wake him and he went for my throat.  They are trained to do this.  He still feels terrible about it and it was years ago.  One thing you can do is get out of bed and grab their big toe and shake it to try and wake them up.  Otherwise I just get the heck out of the way and let it play out.    We have been together for so long that I now wake up when he starts making any kind of noise, and I will roll back and forth and kind of shake the bed to try and bring him out of it a bit.  Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't.

You said he is a heavy sleeper, so none of this may work for you.  He does have a therapy dog though, and they can be trained to wake them when they are having nightmares, and even turn on the lights.  Has his dog been trained to do this?  It might help.

We also have a very low bed that can be rolled out of, if need be.  If he is really thrashing around, that might make you feel safer if you can just roll out of bed and get away.  

My advice for what you can do for him is just be there when he is ready to discuss things.  Do your research on combat PTSD and what it entails.  You will feel more prepared to deal with this stuff if you can recognize what is happening.  He may not want to talk about things right now, depending on how recent the trauma was.  It sometimes takes quite a while to get to the point where they recognize they really need to seek outside help.  It is up to you to decide whether or not you can deal with this day and night for the long haul.  If you have only been together 4 months, he may not be ready to open up yet.  You sound like you do care for him, and he sounds like a good guy.  Nightmares are part of the package with combat PTSD.  PM me if you need to talk!!"
793,"&gt; Is her boyfriend compromising with her at all when he tells her what to do?

----

&gt;He said he didn't want me to stop wearing it completely, just to tone it down a bit.

That sounds like a compromise to me. You can't get into a relationship and then just say, in your words, ""Go fuck yourself"" anytime they bring any issues up. 

OP says that her bf is complaining cause his ex never wore makeup. In reality he's complaining cause it takes her forever to do her makeup and it's ruining his clothes. That sounds completely unrelated to controlling how she looks to me.

But we also both make sure that we have plenty of ""us"" time.  That might be going out on a date, but it might just be sitting on the couch together and chit chatting.

They shoot each other over insults -- someone talking shit online, someone hitting on your girl. 

OP's story actually does not sound made up at all, and could easily be the beginning of a murder in my city. It's dumb as fuck but kids are shooting each other over this stuff.

OP, forget about this girl. Don't provoke people with weapons and a history of violence. Focus on school, stay safe, get out of there.  Nothing is worth your life.

As a woman, I have had to fight hard to be taken seriously simply because most dudes only care what I look like and if they can fuck me or not. This gets fed into by that. Women's bodies are seen as commodities, and that view of women's bodies translates out in a lot of different ways. 

But let me tell you this - I used to think this wasn't a big deal. But when I was in law school, I wrote a fifty page research paper comparing the decriminalization/legalization/status quo of prostitution. It was an eye opener on all fronts, and the way that women are taken advantage of by the requirements of legalization isn't a walk in the park like people think. It changed how I feel about escorts and prostitution, and I firmly believe it is not a good thing. "

817,"Former insurance adjuster (still in insurance) here: in most states, liability for anything involving a vehicle follows the titled owner of the vehicle before the driver of said vehicle. Being an attorney, your boyfriend knows this. He had classes that explained this. I think he's doing this intentionally to keep financial liability on you in case he really fucks up.

For example, let's say boyfriend is paying no attention and slams into a car full of kids (pretty much always get taken to the ER), and they want more money than the insurance limits; *you* are actually more responsible for their damages/injuries as the titled owner than *he* is as the asshole who slammed into them.

Laziness may be a part of it, but 2 years is more than laziness. 2 years is intentional. 2 years is him banking on the fact that you'll give up eventually and he *hopefully* won't maim or kill anyone. 

Don't give up. Sell the car. Get it gone. You can use the excuse that you couldn't look at it anymore if you really want to. If he doesn't buy another car, that's on him, not you. Frankly, if it was me, I'd dump him too for putting me in that position, but of course that is your choice to make."

My sister is marrying a white guy. It took my parents a long time to get over. The fact is, you either accept it or admit to the community you don't talk to your daughter. And for a lot of South Asians, the latter is incredibly worse.

871,"Yeah this has huge misunderstanding written all over it. Frankly it sounds totally insane to me to gift someone you work with and see everyday a charity food basket. Marianne sounds, from the way she's been described, too on the ball to have done this intentionally."
872,"Why did you call feel the need to leap in and defend men there? Nobody believed it was always the man, you just saw the chance to be pedantic and distract from the real problem and haaaad to because mmmmeeeeeennnn. 
"
873,"&gt;He said he was glad it happened because now he was forced to confront that part of himself

Ah yes, the part of himself that forced him to cheat. This is good that he can finally have closure and heal.

His excuses are so lazy that it leads me to believe he doesn't particularly care about you."
874,"when i read that i wanted to lose my shit, all over this page thankfully others have already spoken up so ill take the calm route. Not ok ever. I would have screamed in her face that if she ever did something like that again she would not only not be aloud to see my son, but also i would kick her out of my house. WTF."
875,"I was Anna.

It took my fiance sitting me down, and telling me bluntly, that HE LOVED ME, for me. That if I was so uncomfortable with myself he would help me in any way he could. 86lbs down in a year couldn't be happier.

It started with doing tandum excersies at home, and him makeing keto food and encouraging me to eat keto with him (and not judging me when i binged and hated myself for it) and then him getting me into lifting.

He was super supportive through the entire thing. 

People like Anna and I, cannot be overweight simply because we WILL hate ourselves and be constantly insecure. "
876,"This! He is consistently violent, this is just the first time towards her. The only people I know who consistently get in fights are violent people (shocking I know). His social life was enough to leave 100% of the time BEFORE he ruined his kitchen and hit his SO. "
877,"Even if the pregnancy itself didn't throw her life off track, doctor's fees for prenatal care would likely be much more expensive (depending on insurance) than abortion."
878,"Okay, so you cheated on your girlfriend twice with the same girl both times, lied about the extent of it and she's just now figured that out?

I hate to break this to you, but I think you might be single now. At the very least, I wouldn't count on going on that after Christmas trip with her.

Going forward with your next relationship and emotional affair, the time to come clean about having met and hung out with your former mistress in person was the second time she caught you cheating on her. You say you lied to preserve her feelings, but let's be completely honest here: You lied to preserve your relationship. You lied because you knew that she might consider this to be a dealbreaker, and you were very probably right. You say you were strictly platonic when you met in person, and I have no reason to doubt you. Your girlfriend, however, has absolutely no reason to trust you because you've proven yourself untrustworthy. Just let her go quietly. Do her that favor. Tell her that you're sorry, you understand that you've betrayed her for basically the last four years of her life and you totally get why she doesn't want to talk to you, you're here if she does want to communicate, and you hope she has a nice life. Then -- and this part is important -- **stop contacting her**. If she wants to talk to you, she knows your phone number, bro.

Going forward, maybe seek some sort of therapy to figure out why you did this."
879,"Or fiance is cheating and is trying to create a conflict that could make him look as bad as she does to try and justify her own fuck ups because she feels bad and still wants to be with OP but doesn't feel internally like they would be on the same levels of trust in their relationship without having atleast that little bit of leverage even if it is manufactured. How did this affair accuser get his fiancés phone number? Sounds made up to me, probably as a grasping attempt to gain sympathy for her."
880,"I'd say give it a chance. Some great advice here....meet with him first, get his stance. It sounds like you want to salvage the friendship.

And look, as shitty as it was, mental health is no joke. People literally don't *function* right. You like him, he loves her, be amicable within reason. 

And he was your buddy...he hasn't changed too much, hear him out first if you're concerned. Then let her extend the olive branch if you're still comfortable after talking to him. This is completely salvageable."
881,"The military is like 85% POGs who will never see a battlefield.  It takes a titanic amount of material, logistics, research, and other support jobs to put those boots on the ground in such a way that they can actually accomplish something.  Being directly in harm's way is comparatively rare."

883,"Honestly that's an awful thing to say and I hope it scares you enough you don't ever say shit like that again.


That said, I might send one very professional email with a sincere apology and nothing more. If you're going to get fired anyway it can't hurt. 


""Ms. CEO Daughter, please excuse my breach of professional behavior and courtesy at our holiday party. I am deeply embrassed about what I said in my intoxicated state and it will not happen ever again. Best, Kanazzee""


And then know you did all you can. Don't tell her in person, don't over apologize, and just drop it after you say sorry. Don't drag it out or put her in a position where she might feel unsafe or where you can put your foot in your mouth again by doing it in her office.


Then touch up your LinkedIn and resume and start feelers for new gigs."
884,"My husband intentionally mispronounces things. 


He calls moscato ""mosquito"" and chalupas ""chupacabras""




Drives me batty!"
885,"If the business will pay for your initial Landmark courses, you're working for a ""front."" Well, not a front exactly because they likely conduct the actual business they claim to conduct.  However the profits are at least partially going to this cult &amp; the upper management is all members.  The side-hustle business here is converting new members."
886,"&gt;It's waaay easier to enter from a country that has better relations with the European Union.

Which is almost any country really. Maybe the political situation is getting her mom riled up. "
887,"&gt; It's mostly a lighthearted thing we do. 

Oke but is it going to stay lighthearted? Have you talked about this?

After marriage does he expect you to do everything around the house? Listen to him? "
888,"I agree that if he places all his value and actually inherently believes you need to be a ""good woman"" who is at his beck and call, it's time to dump his ass. I just think that yeah, to some extent I can understand why he reacted like he did, and we all have bad days where we get a little peeved and freak out. Things happen. "
889,"
lol are you her boyfriend??? She buys him weed, beer, and pays for everything... She's fuckin amazing!!"

891,+1.  It could easily be an example of yet another family giving in to the sibling that throws the tantrums.  
892,"OP, you also better talk to a lawyer about the immediate custody issues and arrangements. Your husband could grab them from school just to get back at you once he realizes you aren't rolling over and doing what he wants. "
893,"If he tries to kick you out of that house, you call the police. "
894,this statement reeks of someone who doesnt know inner cities like Detroit
895,"I get it - I'm from a super conservative asian family too. Just be petty and have a bridesmaid spill something on her ;) But in all seriousness, I would leave it to your fiance and then go all kill em with kindness (within reason.) Anything untoward will just give them ammunition - ""see?? i was totally justified in not inviting her! she just (insert whatever)!"""
