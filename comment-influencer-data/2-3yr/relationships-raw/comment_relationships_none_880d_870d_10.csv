0,"Huh, people get upset about hypothetical scenarios all the time. That's what most conversations about the future are about. 

In this hypothetical, he said he would abandon everyone he loves to live as a recluse in Scandinavia in the event of disaster. I would raise an eyebrow if I heard my hypothetical daughters boyfriend say that. Doesn't he care about his family? 

I wouldn't  react like them obviously but it is inappropriate. "
1,"That is bizarre. Especially after he pushed her, he should have under close surveillance. It shouldn't be up to you to protect your child from being physically assaulted at a family party. Has this happened before?"
2,"Go without him. He fucked up, horribly. But that doesn't have to affect you?"
3,"16 year olds are literally psychologically less developed than 21 year olds, especially 16 year old boys. He can put off an air of maturity and make it seem like he is super ahead of the game, but his brain is still that of an adolescent. "
4,"&gt; He told me he was sorry it happened, but also told me I could have just stayed with him and it was my choice to leave, and everything could have been avoided if I had just slept with him. He told me he doesn't always feel like it either, but still has sex with me because he wants me to feel good, and it would have been fair for me to do the same. 

This is sexual coercion and it's an element of sexual assault. Not OK, OP.

I hope you will stop seeing him and reconsider your other school options. It sounds like you have a lot going for you and you might do better at whatever school is best for you. You might find it easier to build your social skills out from under his needs and wishes. 

Good luck, OP. Your instincts are very good. "
5,37m reporting in - also agree that this is not okay.
6,"Have you talked to your doctors about other options outside of opiods to help with the pain?  Perhaps you can use some painkillers, but then couple it with some other sort of treatment.  If you're concerned about getting flagged as a drug addict, just let them know you are uncomfortable with how many painkillers you have to take and want to explore other avenues if possible."
7,"&gt;Should I lay it all out and tell him exactly why I'm leaving

He is abusive, there is no reasoning with an abusive person. You don't owe him an explanation, you don't owe him time to argue his side, you don't owe him another chance or more time to change. He will tell you your reasons aren't valid, he will tear you down. Do not give him the opportunity to mess with your head and doubt yourself again. 

It only takes one person to end a relationship, you don't have to get him to agree that you are better off without him. You already know your life will improve dramatically without him dragging you down, and what he thinks about that is irrelevant. 

I agree with everyone who thinks you should contact a domestic violence shelter asap to ask for advice on getting him out of your home."
8,"""I feel dread just thinking about going back.""

You have your answer. I can't tell you what you should do -- and frankly, your BIL shouldn't either -- but listen to your gut. You don't have to file for divorce immediately, but I would look long and hard at a trial separation. Don't go back and pretend to forgive and forget. He hurt you, he tried to keep you in the house against your will... he is not good for you right now. "
9,"You should not be sleeping in the same bed as him now that you know this. I would also not talk to him about this, as it will likely crush his introverted self with shame and embarrassment, and cut him off from you - who has been a vital support system for him.

Set barriers for yourself without telling him explicitely, but you shouldn't be in bed together like you're pre-teen kids. He sees your body as sexy, and probably has confused feelings about you deep down or otherwise due to you basically being a superhero swooping in and being amazing for him."

13,Staying with this asshole is teaching a horrible lesson to your kids. 
14,dump him. he could have beat your face in tonight
15,"It sounds like she does love you, and that she does want you to be happy, and that she wanted to make you happy by giving you the things she knows you wanted.  And it's entirely possible that she wanted them too, or wanted to want them very badly.  But at the end of the day, if her orientation is where it is, then being with someone of the opposite sex isn't going to be right for her- even if she loves you.  That's the hell of it: you're both good people, you love each other, but there are a few things that love can't conquer.

It's okay to feel sad and confused and like this isn't real and angry and in denial.  You've just been handed a big ball of confusing feelings by the person who would normally help you work through them.  Please think about talking to someone about this.  It's a lot to navigate and there's no need to go it alone."
16,"I am not condoning your husbands actions, but I do understand them. Sorry but I have no real advice to give, except time."
17,"I don't know what label to apply to your mom (and I don't think I should). Suffice to say, she's going through something complicated with her sexuality right now.

Either way, it's suuuper fucked up that she would involve you in keeping her infidelity secret and expect you to lie to your father. That's an unreasonable burden to put on a 16-year-old. You can't preemptively force your child to pick sides in what looks like it will be a very messy separation process.

Don't be the one to break it to your father. Tell your mom to be an adult and talk to him and not involve you in this ridiculous sexual drama."
18,"No, that's not what we're implying.

It's one thing if you two were BOTH undecided. 

But if she wants kids and you're still unsure (which at 28, you should really have some idea where you landed on that especially if you're actively dating/in a relationship), it becomes a problem. 

Wanting kids is not something people can compromise on.

Either you want them or you don't. At 28, you sound like you're kind of ambivalent, but why? You really need to decide whether having kids would enrich your life and be an endeavor you want to pursue. 

Why aren't you comfortable with the idea of her having your kids as it is? It's been almost a year. You don't have to start trying, but you should have some clue whether or not you want to be a parent to her children, if she would be a good parent, if you guys are compatible in the long-term. 

What happens when you decide you don't want kids a year or two from now and you are both 30, have wasted nearly 3 years on a relationship, and now need to break up because your lifestyle goals are incompatible? Both are you will end up hurt and that's something you need to account for and consider."
19,"Right, I like how he's so confident it pays better but he doesn't even know where to apply. This is a disaster waiting to happen."
20,"They could get by, sure. But 90k isn't some ludicrous sum like a lot of people are saying.

Also, what seems to be missed is that 90k is where the salary for his field tops out. I don't think he's said anywhere that that's actually what he's making, just that in his field he could never make more than that."
21,"I think I'm partway between you and u/ThingsUndone.  Good for her for being comfortable with her body and expressing herself online, absolutely.  However it seems a bit inconsiderate to have posted something that was a gift to him without his consent, especially if she had any inkling that nudity in general wasn't something he'd be comfortable with.  

It sounds like they didn't have a conversation before this about their comfort levels on different acts, so both of their feelings are understandable.  They may be acceptable compromise possible, or they may discover an incompatibility - either way a conversation about this needs to happen."
22,"&gt; In this case it is action she didn't cede and he (wrongly) assumed.

Where's the evidence of this?

You're presuming that they have decided to be exclusive physically and that there wasn't ever any communication about not sharing nude pictures of themselves on social media.  That's a lot of assumptions just to fit your view of the situation, isn't it?

Frankly, even if this is the case, then your statement that

&gt; you need to embrace and support that.

is dangerous.  OP does not need to embrace and support that.  He needs to decide how much of a problem it is for him, if it is one, and communicate that with her to see how they go forward."
23,"So why are you putting up with this? 

"
24,"It's the timing I believe, more than the content. I think there might be a tone we aren't getting as well. "
25,"Yes. All of this!!! Leave him. You deserve so much more. Your dad would never want you to be stuck with this asshole.

You deserve time to grieve - and you deserve to be treated so much better. This man is toxic and will just continue to hurt you. I am horrified by the way he is treating you.

I am so sorry for your loss."
26,"I agree with you. Overall I have to say it's even quite nice she calls and says that it's not okay to be disrespectful to her mother. She just basically said her mom needs to be treated better, also by her brother. I do appreciate that though she should have then listened to what OP said that this is how they interact. 
My theory is as follows; she and her friend observed the behavior and talked and got all dramatic about it and how they should do something and then they talked the sis into being the hero and standing up for OPs mom and she called and had a plan already layed out and was all hyped up and the rest was a mix of adrenaline, emotions and verbal diarrhea. 

Maybe OP should try to sit back down with her. But compassionately. Explain to her what it is she said and assure her again that her mother is not getting abused. 
Oh my. "
27,Sorry I didn't read the whole thing but finished the first two paragraphs. You are too far apart in maturity levels. She's obviously in a different place in life than you are. Good luck.
28,"My mother in law used to page (pagers, god I'm old!)  my husband repeatedly, for hours at a time when we were on a date. Then it was the suicide threats ""I guess since you have a girl friend you don't love me"" then she moved on the fake emergencies (flat tire, ran out of gas). It kept going for a good 5 years until we had our first baby. Finally one day he just realized she was doing everything she could to steal his life and happiness from him and he stopped caring about her feelings. They have almost now relationship now because she wanted to be his whole life and wasn't willing to just be part of it. It was really screwed up. 23 years later she's missing out on our two amazing kids and being part of our family. "
29,Find someone that likes to give oral. Stop trying to make this guy the right person for you. You can stay in a relationship that is unfulfilling or you can do something about it. You are getting neurotic because of the person you are with and this is no way to live. Guys that truly like giving oral don't care if you have shaved or showered. We are humans- your puss isn't going to smell awesome twenty four seven. 
30,"Again, your trust issues don't project themselves onto every relationship. You didn't even SEE the pictures, and he said nothing that indicated she was all over other people in ANY of the photos. 

People can have a good time without fucking each other, it doesn't mean what she did was right or responsible, but you can't just start wildly accusing her of things you've seen no evidence of. It's ridiculous and, honestly, it takes away from the real issue that DOES exist, which is the neglect of her familial relationships. That's the true focus here, not whether some insecure dipshit on the internet thinks someone is a cheater from a vague description of photos they were in. Get a grip."
31,"I mean it's likely that things would be different now. You weren't teenagers back then, but still young. People change and maybe your ex regrets what he did (of course, it's not an excuse for what he did)."
32,"&gt;My GF is not usually this weird or jealous. 

I think you're just getting to know how she really is, and she's not a pretty person."
33,"You told her to get a hobby, then you demand she changes it as soon as your schedule changes? She's getting attention she probably didnt get from you when you were  workaholic and now she's having a hard time letting it go.  Plus there's the fact she probably has gym friends now.

I dont know what to do here honestly.  Your actions changed her.  You can ask her to tone it down, but dont be surprised if she says no.  It can be addicting, especially if she's using Instagram or whatnot.  Those people have a cult following."
34,"I'd go with 'giant flaming hypocrite', myself."
35,"""My point will become clear shortly."""
36,"I'd wager he thinks it's ""fixable"" (like) ""she just needs to try the right candy!"""
37,"Had this exact same thing happen to me. Told my ex over and over again I don't eat chocolate often, especially the case for sweet chocolate. Just not my thing. Once in a blue moon I'll get an urge but rarely. My taste for chocolate was displayed whenever she offered me some the whole time we dated.


Yet when Valentine's came around, her sole gift to me was homemade chocolate, and a very very sweet version too. Obviously I looked at it like ""wtf?"" but told her I appreciated the thought and would try a piece, and she was already emotional over me not being overjoyed with it. When she saw the 99% full bag still there a couple weeks later she got pissed and emotional again.


In my case... My ex had literal mental illnesses and disorders that weren't confirmed until the end of the relationship. It's been described to me that these issues led to her wanting to prove some sort of value to me, as in, ""He doesn't like chocolate, *but*, I bet *I* can make chocolate he'd like! Then he'd like me for that!"" kind of thing... but when that didn't happen her emotional regulation broke down and she perceives herself as failing and like an attack on her worth as a girlfriend and person. 


NOT saying your ex is the same. Just giving my similar story. In either case what you can take from my story is: This is really crazy behavior from your boyfriend, on par with someone like my ex. It isn't normal. You shouldn't deal with it. Please don't.


Edit: Why people are trying to find justifications for this by saying stuff like ""maybe he forgot""? That isn't even close to the issue, his behavior is. OP didn't berate him for buying her candy. She told him, ""Hey I told you I don't like candy but I do appreciate the thought"". Then he got upset and has been making OP feel bad over it for the last few *days*. Justify it however you want - ""maybe he's ashamed he forgot"", ""maybe he's ashamed for messing up""...it doesn't matter. If he forgot, what would a good person do? Apologize and ask how to make up for it. Not do what he has been doing. 


OP, you're walking a dangerous line right now. Not only are you unsure whether this guy's behavior is fine (hence why you posted here), but you've also already been trying to appease him, and not holding him completely accountable for acting so crazy. You shouldn't be doing that stuff. You did nothing wrong. "
38,"A good rule of thumb (IMO) for minimum dating age is half your age + 7. That'd be 23.5 and this girl is older than that. 

Age gaps aren't an issue in relationships. It's life experience gaps that are. If you see this woman as an equal, then there's no reason why you can't be happy dating you. 8 years is a huge age gap when you're 17. Not so much when you move past college. "
39,Then continue dating her if you like her. A 33 year old dating a 25 year old isn't a big deal. Both of you have enough life experience to be past the immaturity of the teenage years/college life.
40,"I don't think you're going to win this in conversation with your parents if they've ignored you this long .Honestly, when it comes up I'd probably start telling people, ""I'm not gay, my parents just tell people that so they can seem open-minded. I've told them to stop, but they don't care,"" as casually as possible. The more you get upset over it the more people will think you're in denial. And maybe it'll get back to them and they'll cool it."
41,"The spouse also needs to realize that this worries are his/her issue, instead of using those worries to enforce that his/her spouse not do something. 

&gt;At the same time, partners have a responsibility to help their spouse overcome those insecurities, to work with them and exhibit patience on their side as well. 

To a point. The partner has to want to work through their insecurities and recognize that they have to change. Just keeping her from going camping with her fellow cadets isn't acknowledging a problem He has to come face to face with his personal issues and his personal trust issues. His insecurities are not her burden to bear. They are his. He needs to realize that, and then work towards a resolution with her. 

"
42,"A relationship isn't built on telling your spouse what they can and cannot do.

These are her fellow cadets. A lot of them. Male and female. A group event like this is potentially the least threatening scenario possible and doesn't require that much trust even.

If he can't trust her in a group, how is she supposed to believe that he will trust her on patrol? 

"
43,"Love that second sentence.

You definitely deserve to be someone's all-star starter, not a backup. "
44,"Is this the boyfriend that literally everyone in both of your lives wanted you to get away from the last time you posted here?  The one dependent on his family as he's too mentally ill to care for himself?  The one you've caused fights with his family over?  You deleted the post but your comments are all still there.

That boyfriend?

You left a *metric fuckton* of context out of this post, my guess in  a ploy to get us on your side.

You're still trying to argue with his family.  You're going to lose."
45,"&gt; Well I like sex and my wife said she would just go to the bathroom afterwards and it would be fine (yes I know...). 

There are times when the double facepalm just doesn't seem enough.


&gt;  I am trying to get input from folks who have dealt with a similar situation and moved forward.

I think your first step is to stop blaming her and accept your responsibility."
46,"I have a three month old daughter, if someone were repeatedly holding her up and letting her fall face first while she cries I'd be calling the fucking police."
47,"I think an abusive marriage is more of a broken family than anything. Plenty of children grow up with separate but happy divorced parents. I don't remember my parents being together but if they had stayed all I'd remember is them fighting and calling each other horrible names. Not healthy. 

If you don't get out your son will grow up to be three things 
1) He will learn from his father that women are inferior and don't deserve respect and good treatment. He'll likely become abusive to his future partner and will otherwise be manipulative and terrible. Like his father.

Or

2) He will hate, hate, hate his father for the way he treated you. And he will start to notice sooner than you realize that Dad doesn't treat Mom the way other dad's do and Mom is always sad. This is the situation with a guy I know whose dad is an abusive ass and his mom stayed. He hates his dad and doesn't really even care that he's dying.

Or

3) How long until the kid pisses your husband off? What are you going to do if he calls him stupid? If he talks to him he way he talks to you? Even if he's never directly abused it will be normalized to a large amount by you just taking it and continuing to stay. People with abusive parents are far more likely to end up in abusive relationships themselves. 


All three options are very possible if you stay. A big part of growing up is seeing healthy adult relationships so you can have similar ones as an adult. If all of your models are unhealthy as a kid then the ones you form as an adult will be unhealthy. Put this broken home stuff back in the 1950s and get out of your broken marriage where you are deeply unhappy. A deeply unhappy marriage is already broken. It's your job to ensure your kid has healthy relationships modeled for him even if this means cutting your abusive husband out completely. 

Please please make a plan where it will be safe for you to leave. Do it for yourself and your son. "
48,"He's right.  You need to let him make his own decisions.

What you need to do is make the right decisions for yourself and your son.  And he isn't it.  It doesn't matter if he cries, it doesn't matter if you love him.  What matters is that when you need him, he isn't there.  

I think both of you have valid points, but what tips it towards you is that he's unemployed.  When I've been in unemployed and supported by my SO my absolute priority is our relationship.  I cook, clean, do the taxes, plan outings- all that shit.  Because he's the one supporting me and I need to contribute to 'us' in any way I can to pull my weight.  In your relationship, your bf isn't pulling his weight.  You and son aren't the focus of his time, he doesnt contribute money and he spends (some of) what you earn on his family.  

Love isn't enough.  He's never going to be what you want and need in a partner.  You know that, you're just in denial.  I'm sorry.

Break up with him, and put the money you're spending on him and his family towards paying for a replacement 'responsible adult in the room'. 

Good luck, and I hope that the surgery works.

  "
49,"&gt; What kind of person does he take me for? 

Human? 

I mean, most people don't plan to cheat, initially at least. The kind of serial cheater who actually gets off on cheating is rare. More people slide into cheating or an affair, as small mostly innocent choices pave the way for larger ones. A connection builds that seems innocent and friendly at first, and then it gets away from you and turns into something else.  ""The kind of person who doesn't cheat"" doesn't simply say no to cheating, they take into account human nature and stay aware of their relationships with others while prioritizing and building boundaries around their relationship with their significant other. I wouldn't be able to trust someone who insisted ""I'm not that type of person"" because I wouldn't trust them to be careful about making earlier choices to protect the relationship. 

Which is not to say she shouldn't go, but honestly professions with intense bonding with co-workers are a risk factor for affairs. Acknowledging that is an important step to mitigating it."
50,"There's different types of broken. 

You drop a glass, it may break into pieces. Or just develop a crack in it. But either way, it can't hold water properly any more. 

You could try to hold it together to use it still. You could also try to fix it, but you would always have to be on the lookout for those cracks that could get worse. And you aren't the only one that could be hurt-your child could get wet or even cut.

You have to decide if the glass is really worth it. But you also have to consider that even if you put in the effort to fix it, is the glass even strong enough if you do?

"
51,She works for a nonprofit. How would their salaries even begin to be comparable?
52,"That wasn't a date, it was a prosyletisation session. Flee."
53,"I am in an almost identical situation. Except my abusive dad drained all of the joint accounts and the retirement account, remortgaged the paid off house and let it go into foreclosure, got my mom fired from her job, and ""fled"" to another state. Now my life is on hold because I have to financially prop up the rest of my family, and I have no spare rooms to try to put a baby in because they have to live with me for a few years. 

Do yourself a favor. Call the police, show them the bruises, show them any evidence you can of the abuse. Get that asshole out of all of your lives. He will not stop until he destroys your lives."

55,"I'm a former Catholic turned atheist dating a Catholic, but we aren't young and we've discussed a lot of things, and he's...not particularly religious.  Still, there are stumbling areas.   

What happens if she gets pregnant?  As an atheist, are you aware of her position on abortion? Are you using birth control? 

Would you have kids with her? Do you want to ensure they're raised in the church? How do your parents feel about you dating someone who isn't religious? 

Are you hoping to convert her? Is she trying to convince you? 

If you want this for anything other than something casual, you need to really think about it.  "
56,"This has nothing to do with the 1950's. Different couples have different setups - I stay at home with the baby and my husband works, we have friends who are both writers who split everything from childcare to cooking pretty much 50/50, some other friends with stay-at-home dad who does some part-time work from home and mom works full time out of the house. In all of those situations, the couples (who are all in happy marriages, as far as I can tell) strive to meet the needs of the family and the spouse as a whole, not to see what they can get as they do the bare minimum. 

 There is no equality in your situation; you're doing all the work and your girlfriend is having all of the fun. Have you sat her down and said something along the lines of:""I feel like the bulk of responsibilities in maintaining this relationship and our lifestyle fall on me."""
57,"&gt;If I just said that he's going to ask why. 

""Oh it's just not possible. Gotta go, sorry, the cat's on fire.""

58,That's really selfish of you. Learn to put the boot on your son. 
59,I've thought about it but honestly the constant moving is just an inconvenience rather than a big part of it. I think I'm getting down because I don't just have a place to live. Sounds petty because I know I'm still lucky to have both of them

63,"OP, I could barely believe the content of your post after reading the title - there is NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU AND YOU ARE NOT A BAD PERSON. You are struggling with your mental health and your new medication, but the problem here is that your partner is emotionally abusive. PLEASE leave. He is the reason you think you are ""crazy"" because he is gaslighting you and tearing you down. A loving partner will support you through mental health or any other struggles. "
64,"Yeah, this would worry me too. It's good that OP is excited about trying new experiences and discovering different facets to her sexuality, but this is really sort of sketchy, especially if the relationship goes south. It could be disastrous to her professionally."
65,"Just want to point out, the brother is 18 years old. He should know and be able to communicate what's medically necessary for himself by now."
66,"I am graduating this summer, so I'm done taking out loans for this year.  But, I am interested in doing a rural scholars program that allows you to go to medical school with a tuition waiver. Hopefully, I will get into one because it allow me to go to med school for free and I want to become an OB/GYN or do ER.

But you are right it will be a while.

I would never expect him to pay this. It is solely my responsibility.

It is actually the most relevant of my worries right now. I have a financial plan to pay off my loans and I have decided how to finance school. It's not the money that matters in this situation, more so his reaction and how resistant he seems to help me. Even if we moved to a different state, I would be making more money than him, and I would have helped him out if he asked. 

I'm not sure what you mean long-term and getting on the same page. I've already talked to him about doing this program. What kind of questions/subjects do you think I should discuss?"
67,"No, people do not stick around if they want a relationship and you tell them you just want to be friends.  Those are very different wants and they will take you at your word.  No one wants to feel rejected constantly by someone they like, and it is often hard for people to switch their brain from ""I want a relationship with this person"" to ""I want friendship with this person."""
68,"You don't need to be friends. It isn't mandatory. Relax and give her space to do whatever. If she values your friendship, she might come around. But it doesn't sound like it's all that worth it.

70,"I know it was a weird (and dumb) thing to do. For a little more context, when we first started talking we were on an out-of-town trip for our club, and I kinda figured we would have a little fling and then go back to our regular lives after the trip, so I didn't see any particular harm in fudging the age a little if it meant getting to hang out with a boy way out of my league for a couple days. No one was more surprised than me when he asked me out for real after we got back. I should have immediately set the record straight then, but....I guess my morals took a backseat to my heart, and then I just felt ""too deep"" and was too nervous to come clean. 

Extremely stupid, I know. Thank you for the good thoughts, though."
71,"This is close to what my husband and I do. For example, if my husband has an event, he will rate the importance of me going there from 1 to 10. If it's a 2 or 3, I know he won't be upset if I skip it. An 8 or 9 means I usually choose to go since I know it's important. It saves the feelings of guilt if you want to skip an event and works out really well for us!"
72,"When stuff goes wrong in the relationship, you turn to your partner who's in it with you. You don't bring thirds in and add another level of shit that's wrong with the relationship.. It really doesn't matter what's going on, he could break up with Tina before sleeping with someone else. "
73,"Just because that's what you and your parents did, doesn't mean everyone feels that way. It's unfair for you to tell OP that she's ""cheapening"" marriage just because she wants a certain ring. Realize that people are different. That's nice you and your fiancée want simple bands, but obviously OP feels differently. "
74,"I think you're not sharing the full story here. You like her, and it's either 

A) You're too scared to tell her or make a move. 

B) She friend-zoned you.

Either way, no one spends a ""bit of money"" on a party for just a regular ""friend."" 

To answer your question, you will look like a fool. No one will think you're being nice, they will see it for what it is. At best they see that you're timid and have no courage to make a move and at worse they see that you're someone who can be easily taken advantage of.

Final word of advice: Never ever invest in anyone the time, emotion, or money that they would not invest in you in return. The only exception are your kids. You will lose their respect and the respect of so many others. Do not think that doing so will make you look ""nice"" and ""genuine."" Instead, it makes you look foolish, desperate, and conniving. "
75,"Like I said, not condoning stealing, but again there are systemic problems that lead to that lifestyle beyond ""being a piece of shit""."
76,"You sound like a nanny that he gets to sleep with. This is not a relationship. You'll need a serious discussion about him changing his priorities. He has a lot of room for compromise. I have a bunch of gamer friends with kids, and they play game regularly, but a few hours at a time, not the whole day. "
77,"Ok, so she's insufferable, immature, and your relationship is toxic.  Let her avoid you if she wants.   Forcing someone to interact with you when they want to get away from you only makes things worse.  If you believe like she's overreacting and immature, break up with her.   "
78,"This wasn't access to someone's phone or house or anything. This was direct access to Snapchat, granted by her boyfriend in a mutual agreement.  "
79,Yeah I agree that's why I also said when the kids go to bed. Not sure why my comment is getting down voted. 
80,Newsflash. A **lot** of girls are going to be uncomfortable with their boyfriends grinding on another girl. That's not emotional blackmail. That's life.
81,"there's a way around that too. What you do is send a nice gift and card and all that before the wedding. On the day before, have bouquets delivered to both the bride and to your step-mother's hotel rooms, with notes saying that you two are so sorry to not be there with them and you're thinking of them as they go through the happy day tomorrow. Write something cheesy about step mom being mother of the bride/ 'especially important day for her'.  Shouldn't cost much money and will go pretty far to assuaging any snarkiness. (I also have tricky in-laws, and it's just more pleasant to do these little nonsense manipulative suck-ups than deal with the craziness) "
82,"But the drive was completely unnecessary, and also not a great idea on an evening he'd been drinking.  "
83,Sounds like your idiot husband needs to get a second job.  
84,"I don't think these things happen suddenly or overnight.  Call it death by a thousand cuts if you like.  You can't point to any one particular thing.  Something brought both of you to this point, what that is, I'm not sure if you will ever know.  Just know that this is just another point in your life where you can make a choice to move on and change or stay stuck where you are, confused and in pain.  I know this seems like the end of the world, and it is in a sense, but it is also the beginning of new world that you can choose to embrace or ignore.  Twenty five isn't Forty, this is a great chance for you to become who you want to be.

I'm sure that this moment is very difficult for you, and you are feeling left hung out to dry in a lonely place. "
85,"Things she has not noted - how old is the dog? what breed? why did he adopt it?

A puppy or older dog will need to pee more often and crating it that long is more cruel. An active breed or hunter dog will also need to get out of the crate more often. 

I am genuinely curious why he has a dog. I have a career that requires me to be away for long hours. I have two cats, and an automatic feeder that I can program remotely, and a water fountain with capacity for multiple days, and they are never confined, and I have a security camera that lets me check in on them, and I still worry sometimes if they are okay while I am at work. I can't fathom why this guy thought it was okay to get a dog that he's going to crate all day long. "
86,"Ooooo boy. This is tough. It sounds like she might be depressed? 

If I were in your shoes, I would frame it as concern for her and her well-being. 

""Honey, I've noticed that you stopped doing xyz, and I'm concerned because it seemed to be something that you really loved doing. Is everything ok?"" 

She might be feeling lost or unfulfilled and not quite know why. Keep in mind that it's not your job to ""fix""
her, and she might resent the implication that she needs fixing. Get yourself to a place where you can approach this non-judgmentally. 

As far as the whole complimenting her looks deal - I've had a similar experience with my SO, where I would get uncomfortable with his compliments because they didn't seem to be for me, they seemed to be for him (i.e., he was telling me these things because he wanted something from me). It seemed...transactional. 

At the end of the day, you want her to feel loved, and seen and heard, yes? If so, ask her what makes her feel those things. And if she doesn't know the answer, then suggest exploring that together. "
87,"Understandable, but would you never wash your partner's dishes if you're already at the sink or pick up their favourite cookies while you're at the bakery or pick them up a treat because work has been stressful lately? Everyone has gestures they appreciate and don't appreciate, but it's completely foreign to me to have no desire for a partner voluntarily doing something nice for you for no reason"
88,"Are you sure stealing is her intention?  Did she think that she was going to replenish what she took?  Where did you expect she was going to pay tuition from?


It is not ok that she gave you no heads up about the draining the account, but I think you should calm down and talk to her.  Afterall, you merged accounts, you can expect her to put money back into this account from her 80hr//wk job."
89,"&gt; most people will have no idea how awful you feel

As OP says, he wasn't very close to his brother until more recently. If Sharron was aware of the long-standing grievance between the brothers, perhaps she couldn't comprehend the magnitude of OP's loss and how much he needed her support at the funeral

91,"I guess I don't fully understand how having sex too early in a relationship and then continuing to have it would kill your sex drive. I mean, it's 8 months down the road now. Unless he pressured you or raped you.. did he? 

In any event, if you really think that's the problem, maybe you should just go your separate ways. You can't go back in time and change what happened. Maybe therapy would help. "
92,True but OP could have also given the bride more than 24 hours before calling her out. They both could have done better.

94,"Usually I go into these posts prepared to be on OP'S side, but uh, you got nothing, dude. Seems like a tight friendship. Sounds to me like you're insecure because your coworkers think Dani and Connor should be together, which is fucked on their part but it's not your girlfriend's fault. Do they tell her she should be with Connor? Does she shut them down if they do? If so, then you just need to get all of these other people out of your head. What they think has no bearing on your relationship unless you let it. "
95,"Take it from an older engineer, not everything in life is logical.  I used to be like you and felt the need to ""correct"" everyone.  You don't make friends, create a career network, or find an SO if you're like that.

Instead, how about keeping your opinions to yourself?  Your personality isn't going to change, so put a filter on your pie-hole.  Sure, if someone asks your opinion you can open up, but you need to start making strategic decisions about when to say what to whom."
96,"She doesn't really seem like she's blaming you. She just seems upset in general, which is understandable. Being rejected is hard, and harder when it's your friend that was picked. 

It's normal to be upset over something you rationally know you shouldn't be. Give her some space, tell her you understand and it should be fine "
97,lol. He doesn't want to divorce you because then your finances will finally be as mixed as it can get. 
98,Because dealing with bullshit like this is literally Penny's manager's job.
99,"what the fuuuuuuuuuck. I can't believe people like this exist. They've been together FIVE YEARS and she cares so little about him that she'd immediately leave him if something that's (almost) completely out of his control happened to him? 

edit: more info from OP's posts below.

he has never been fired from a job. she doesn't work or go to school. she's ""working on herself"" 

........i...can't...even...  

she must be really fucking hot or something. "
100,"Yeah =/ it's unfortunate timing, but I think you dodged a bullet there. Karen seems to be severely lacking in empathy. As odd as it sounds, I think for funerals, the more the merrier, meaning that it makes sense to want the entire world to come if it could. My pastor always says that you can miss a wedding, but you should never miss a funeral. It's not only about paying your respects to the deceased, but also to show your support to the family members who now have their entire world turned upside down. Every last piece of encouragement helps. "

Does he know you are happy to give him bjs whenever and that you want sex everyday at least? Initiate sex in the mornings if thats when he's using porn. Be open and let him know how much you want him. 

"
103,"exactly.

he just expects its your job to clean it and says it's not him, knowing it is. Quite honestly I would have refused cleaning straight away. 

It is not only childish it is extremely baffling that he pee's all over not owning up to it.

It would be one thing if he had been embarassed the first time and then made sure it doesn't happen again but he just thinks: her job to clean after me.

I would be a lot more angry than you seem to be."
104,"Dude, your wife needs to know why you're saying no. Specifically the cheating and the heartbreak. She needs to know it would hurt you more for her to say ""yes"" to this than it would hurt them for her to say ""no.""

Also... in many instances it's fucked up to tell somebody who they can or can't have contact with; but in this case I think the ex-wife is somebody you can ask your wife to cut ties with. Honestly. Seriously. "
105,"Serious anxiety disorder here too - I feel as if this book actually calmed my anxiety in some ways. If I was alone in the house, I used to get overwhelmingly anxious to the point where I would need to search the house to ensure it was empty, and barricade my door at night to protect myself. Not exactly a healthy approach. The book is essentially about trusting your gut - not your mind - and it focuses on the difference between the way our mind processes and sorts stimuli and how our instincts do. Understanding this, and how it applied in real life situations, made it easier for me to identify what was anxiety and what was a genuinely risky situation. Obviously tho, I just wanna say that we aren't the same person so I can't guarantee that it wouldn't make your anxiety worse. But I found it to be amazingly helpful in quelling my anxious thoughts, which was not something I expected when I read it. "
106,"OP is 18.  Her sister is 26.  

That said, I don't believe her one bit.  Sounds like shes talking crap so she can look cool and not entitled, but when the rubber hits the road, I seriously doubt she'd move back to a third world country to raise her kids."
107,"Question off topic but to think about if you stay together are you going to have kids? Will her family accept your kids? 

Edit to add: in a mixed marriage, it would be a no go to hide we were engaged. That's not cool"

She was having signs and symptoms. So less likely to be a faulty test.

"
109,"If he's as shy and intelligent as you say he is, I'm sure a short + simple ""There are pictures of me on your phone. Cropped ones of my body. Delete them."" will be sufficient to point out that he has fucked up without further discussion. 

Might want to throw in a second line of ""Taking photos of women's bodies like that without their permission is wrong and objectifying, by the way.""  He can guide the conversation from there if he wants to. "
110,IDK what's up with the responses to this one... It's pretty weird. I would probably just distance myself from him to limit any growth of these feelings. 
111,"&gt;  I don't want to come across to him as being ""aggressive"" to other group members

Unfortunately if he's the kind of guy who has a certain mindset, you'll come across as aggressive just for existing in the workplace. It's sad but it's a lose lose for women in science (lose if you speak up/ lose if you don't). 

He may also just be the kind of boss who is ignoring this disrespect because he doesn't care about the interactions unless it's HR worthy. "
112,We are. He's going to be going to school in a new city where we have family. I just meant like right now. 
113,"Why are you even with this train wreck? 

At the very, very least he's a controlling hypocrite. I very much doubt that there aren't other substantial issues with him because people like this are generally riddled with problems. 

"
114,"The guy claims he was so drunk he had no clue what he was doing, yet was sober enough to download tinder, find a girl, talk to her, download an additional app, talk to her there and send selfies? No, he knowingly did this. To some people, this would be cheating. To almost anyone, this would be a gigantic breach of trust. 

He has demonstrated that when he feels ""lonely"" he will seek comfort in other women instead of working with you to find a solution. How can you be sure that he won't do the same thing in the future when he isn't feeling comforted by you? The guy is a freeloader who does not work while you work 2 jobs, and while you are working to survive, he's whining that your employment and his lack thereof is tempting him to look outside of your relationship. What else do you need to leave this guy?

His depression or loneliness is not an excuse to betray your trust. His inability to control his alcohol is not an excuse, and we still need to take accountability for what we do when drunk. This guy made the decision to look for other women. You can either stay with an unemployed drunk who cannot handle being alone for any period of time, or you can move on and find an adult."

116,"You tell him he's coming to couple's counseling with an open mind or you're packing a bag. When he flips out and refuses, you pack said bag and leave until he's willing to work on this shit. If that day doesn't come, you don't come back."

119,That's not for your benefit. It's so the kid who desperately wants family and a male figure in his life doesn't get crushed if they fizzle out after a couple of months of dating.
120,"This was always a rebound relationship.  Do yourselves BOTH a favor, and end the relationship.  You deserve someone you love and have passion for.  That's not this girl.  And she deserves someone who is CRAZY about her and wants to marry her.  That's not you.  Maybe in some ways she was good for you (and hopefully vice versa) but this relationship lasted way longer than it should have.  

She doesn't sound like a bad person.  Set her free so she can hopefully meet someone who does want marriage and kids with HER."
121,"This is a tough one.  I can see both your points of view.

Law enforcement can be a very clique-oriented job, so from her perspective, this camping trip is a way of bonding with her classmates.  She's also probably really excited to have met some new friends.

How long have you guys been together?  Has she ever given you reason to distrust her, either outright distrust in her interactions with other guys, or distrust in her choices about alcohol and drugs (e.g. getting suuuuper drunk without intending to)?

I'm surprised you guys haven't talked about having you come along.  The fact that she didn't try to include you is a bit eyebrow raising (I don't mean she's going to cheat on you, just that she either didn't respect you enough to push for your inclusion, or something)

Either way, if she's going to be a LEO, you're going to have to learn to deal with her spending a lot of time in groups of 'macho' guys.  So figure out what you need to do to be okay with that.

Lastly, you guys should talk more about this.  You need to learn more about what this group of guys means to her, how she feels about their friendship, if she feels like she's part of the core group or is struggling to be included, etc."
122,"Your girlfriend's text with her friend goes beyond objectively acknowledging your friend's attractiveness. She *admits* to being jealous of the other woman, and it's heavily implied she'd drop you for him if she had the chance. Not cool."

126,"You've been dating for a few months and she's annoyed that after all that time your first kiss wasn't ""ideal""?  Is she waiting for an orchestra to be playing and fireworks to be going off while the two of you kiss in a light rainstorm under a full moon?  

The first kiss I had with my wife was a half-drunk goodnight kiss on a NYC sidewalk after 3 cocktails on our first date.  The ideal time to kiss is whenever you want to kiss.  

If this relationship is ""messed up"" by this kiss situation, I don't think it's your fault.  "

146,"True that everyone, including myself when I was dating, usually tells potential dates upfront, like before the first date.  I hadn't thought of this when I typed my response, as I was focused on OP trying to maneuver a new relationship with 4 kids in the middle of it, but yes, I've been there and I agree.  As a single parent, all the guys I dated had their own children, so it was never an issue (except for one guy whose ex-wife had a drug problem so he got ""emergency"" full custody and that threw his life into complete chaos.  The kids had NO discipline with their mother, so our relationship did not end well. I believe his life was pretty hellish for at least a few years after that, but we didn't stay in touch)."

153,"You didn't hire him. You're not his boss and he's not your employee. You chose to continue dating someone with no job instead of hiring someone who is actually a caretaker and not just your boyfriend who you project dependency issues onto. If you have problems with him ""calling out of work,"" then ""fire him"" by breaking up and getting a better employee. You describe your boyfriend as your employee and expect people to treat you like your relationship is healthy...? It's toxic and you expect him to be at your beck and call because you're ""paying"" him to live with you. "
154,"What's weird to me is that the story starts out with OP's girlfriend pushing OP to get a better job, and ends with her making snarky insults once he does, rather than being happy for him.

&gt; And, you got lucky because you had her pushing you to do more.

This seems like quite the leap to me.  This sub has many posts by people who can't get their significant others to pursue more lucrative careers, despite repeatedly pushing them to do so.  I'm sure that his girlfriend's encouragement was helpful, and luck played a part, too, but OP's drive and hard work seem to have had the largest role in landing this job.  ([OP's comment below](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/66krrm/my_girlfriend_26f_is_upset_about_our_salary/dgj9dq5/).)"
155,"Yes it sounds like she did ""neuter"" herself for you, that's a real thing that can happen when a person decides they'd rather be loved than have more sex and believe that the low libido partner is the only one who will love them the way they want to be loved. 

I believe that she has low self esteem to the point where she thinks that she's not going to find a mate who will have sex with her as often as she'd like anyway, so she's going to make it work with you. 

I'm also guessing you did a good bit of rejecting early in the relationship, possibly even in an unknowingly hurtful way, and that kicked her own libido down out of a desire not to suffer rejection. You should do what you can to make sure you don't do that again but give her options for satisfying her desires. 

You ought to work through her feelings on this in sex positive therapy and determine if there's a way for her to feel satisfied rather than just shut down. That may not be something you can give her, but see if you have a hormone issue first before you start considering an open relationship, etc. 

Eventually she will probably develop some self esteem and then her sex drive may kick back up. If that happens then you should both be ready to discuss it and figure out options rather than just reject her until her self esteem tanks again. "

It's kind of a tricky one since you've only been dating for two months, if the guy you're dating would tell you he doesn't want you to go out with his roommate, would you listen to him?"

162,"HOLD UP.  You are describing red flags for depression and serious mental health problems.

Get him to a therapist. If moving gives you more time to actually parent him, then move. That is serious enough to consider asking for family medical leave. Get him to therapy first and discuss an action plan with the therapist so if you do take time off, 

Unless you are incredibly abusive, this did not just manifest when he moved in with you. Stop looking for excuses to get out of parenting.

Your child is in pain- abandoning him will only hurt him more. If he moved in and you discovered he had undiagnosed diabetes, would you say ""living with me isn't good for him"" and ship him off? This is the same damn thing.

Take a parenting class. Get him to therapy. *Be a parent*."

I'm not sure if some of them can ever be resolved to be honest. You and your fiancée aren't on the same page at all. However, even if you see a counselor you don't know how long that will take and if it'll resolve something, so yeah, postpone the wedding indefinitely. Be prepared though, to not have a fiancée anymore."
167,She is probably asexual and will never reciprocate the physical side of love you have.   This is not how to live your life.  The rejection will eventually pick away at your self worth and cause you to resent her.  You just need to end it and find someone who is acutally compatible with you.
168,Definitely not super rich.  I may try this as education is important to our family as a whole. 
169,"Voting no on the 'open relationship' idea for a few reasons:

1. He's obviously not okay with it. Starting an open relationship would just be putting him in the same situation you currently find yourself in. If you really do love him I'm sure you don't want that.

2. Open relationships are VERY risky. You should never share something you aren't willing to lose, and if you are willing to lose what you  currently have why not just start something new?

3. I feel like there is something major being left out of this story. For most men, sex is a big part of the relationship. I can't help but think that there is a big reason why he would be acting this way..."

172,"A toxic person can destroy a small business. She'll run off good workers, and if she's throwing tantrums then customers have likely noticed. If she won't shape up, Jack needs to consider firing her or else she'll sink the ship.

And if she's this miserable, do you really think this is the right job? A lot of people stay in a bad job out of fear, and getting laid off can change their life for the better. If she has skills, she'll be able to find a job where she's happier and isn't making everyone miserable."
173,"This. If she wasn't a mother, then even two full weekends away getting drunk isn't as big a deal - the broken promise is uncool, but equally the rest is kind of her problem. We all like to go out with our friends and sometimes these things end up meaning a busy few weeks/month.

But her child makes this different. OP isn't just chilling at home wondering where she'll be - he's doing all the childcare Friday-Monday (assuming also Thursdays when she goes out with home friends from another post). She's giving up on limited alone time with OP rather than just another weekend. 

And agree that once and an apology is one thing, routinely and breaking promises is another."
174,And has those in spades already.
175,"Yeah, people are missing the forest for the trees. This is a woman who ""enjoyed the shit"" out of her 20s, then spent the last 2ish years pregnant and with a baby. She leapt at the first opportunity to relive her 20-something party days because she hasn't adjusted to the new lifestyle she and her husband have. A brain tumor is really not necessary to explain any of this."
176,"For most people, that would be a totally different story again.

&gt; He doesn't even love the family he has now enough to stay, so why should he have more kids? The only reason he wants to leave his family is because they're a family of 3 instead of 4. That's selfish and cold hearted and makes me wonder if he ever even loved his wife at all. 

Again, this could also be turned around. If OP was always on the fence, why did she agree on marrying a guy who wanted two kids? Why didn't she just break it off and choose someone else? This isn't just about only having one child, it's also about his wife suddenly changing their future plans. This is something he doesn't really have a say in. So he should just deal with it? What if it was OP who wanted more kids? Browse a bit through reddit. Divorce is really the best solution in most of those cases.

You can love your kid and your family, but something like this is extremely hurtful and hard to deal with. OP's husband's feelings are just as valid as OP's. 

"
177,"&gt;Do I let her have the experience so that she can say she tried it? 

No, that's not how monogamous relationships work. Besides, it sounds like she wants to do it just to get back at you because she's jealous. A loving partner wouldn't (and shouldn't) try to weaponize sex.

&gt;I'm a jealous person also and the thought of her being with others makes me uncomfortable. Especially since we both talked about being monogamous in the past. I want her to be happy, but I feel like I should be able to make her happy on my own?

What you did: Had consensual sexual contact with others before your relationship.

What she is proposing to do: Have revenge sex with others during your relationship. 

What she wants to do is vastly different than what you did. She's asking to change the dynamic of your relationship (and possibly damage it beyond repair) to get back at you for something you did prior to your relationship. These are probably the worst circumstances under which to open an existing relationship. "

I thought you said you didn't have any tattoos or marks? Giving him a 50/50 chance to guess right makes it quite unlikely that he'll say ""you don't have any,"" under pressure. 

Given that he's proven he will fabricate shit for maximum impact, asking more specifically makes it more likely he'll deflect and spew more lies that will just make your SO's mind spin out. (Btw, he sucks for not believing you, but he walked in and saw the kiss so everything is skewed by his visceral reaction to that. Which makes it more understandable)

Picking a more hidden body part than your ankle means he can't just look at facebook photos or whatever to find out. Even if you're in a bikini, it's likely at least part of your butt/boobs are hidden..."
183,"The problem I see is that you vent a lot in this post and comments. However, when asked ""Why do you put up with this?"" you don't reply. 
 
It seems like what you REALLY want is validation, but not for the sake of making useful decisions. You want validation to bring it back to your bf, and say ""Everyone agrees with me that I'm right and you're wrong, so there, now you have to change."" It seems to me as if you are holding out hope that if you get enough validation, then he'll HAVE to change. 

But that's not how this works. That's why everyone is asking you why you are still with him. He is never going to change. You can show him this whole thread, an say ""See, you're WRONG!"" You can get a judge to tell him how wrong he is. You could put him on TV and have 500 million people vote that he's wrong, and he won't change. 
 
I know that if he just changed, it would solve your problems. You  care about him and you're thinking of the good times you've had. But that's not who he is. You are hoping for a fantasy that will never happen. 

So people are asking ""Why are you still with this guy?"" because YOU are the one who has to make the change. Not him. You have to decide if you will put up with him or not. He will not change."

188,"No that's not TMI, we're all adults here. 
Listen, that's not a side issue. That's huge. That shows selfishness. Disrespect. And a whole lot of other things. The way it sounds is that you're not asexual, you just hate having sex with HIM. He's looking to get it in, and isn't taking the time to make it an act of mutual passion/pleasure. I have been in a similar scenario (though not married we were together for 5 years). He would never take the time to make me orgasm, or listen to me. He wouldn't pay attention to my desires or body, and would basically just try to rub my clit off aggressively. The worst part was he didn't even know where the clit was so he was just rubbing some random area above it lol. Anyways, he wouldn't listen. He wouldn't give, only take. And it really made me HATE sex. I wanted it over with, and skipped foreplay altogether. It was awful and I thought something was wrong with me too. He also tried to repeatedly do things I wasn't into.

I ended up breaking up with him because of his refusal to hear me. But that doesn't have to be your fate. Maybe there's a way you can talk to your husband and be honest, and say that you just aren't fully enjoying it. Maybe he will listen, and make a genuine effort to please you both sexually and emotionally:) 
"
189,"As a new therapist, I would also be unsurprised if your husband's lack of self-starting/ inability to start his new career was a subconscious wish to keep himself from rooting his life and yours next to his mother. It could also be residual subconscious feelings about not being independent -- but also all of these feelings would be best explored in therapy as he has a REALLY unhealthy relationship with his mom. 

Truly we all need to learn to grow up and away from our parents at some point, and his mom is making it much harder for him to do so. Do you have any insight as to why he is getting this from his mom and not the other kids? Is he the only son? The youngest? "

195,"For one I'd stop the excessive drinking if it makes you more likely to grind and kiss strangers. And yeah- for a lot of ppl kissing others is a deal breaker- though every couple is different re what they consider cheating.

You need to stop bandaiding problems with excessive drinking and partying. Arguments are not excuses for hooking up with others- that's something more permissible if you go on a break/break up but not right after an argument. 'Whoops I cheated, sorry it was cause we had a fight' - isn't valid logic. Also- are none of your friends caring about your behaviour/relationship?!

No it doesn't sound like mature behaviour to bandaid arguments with drinking and playing up. Yeah- I'd probably talk to your partner about it and let whatever be be- if she dumps you for it it sounds like it's for the best cause you don't really seem happy handling ldr's or compromises, or maturely responding to fights.

In relationships there will be ups and downs- if your response to the downs is to find hook ups then you're probably not ready for anything serious. Maybe if the right girl came along you'd tone it down- but I kind of feel in this case you don't care enough to do so or are not ready. It's not overly sexy but relationships take compromise and maturity- even more wo when long distance. Either way you don't seem happy, and she probably won't be either: but yeah you kind of sound like you need to have 'the talk.'"
196,"It's important that she does go to the doctor's appointment if an iud is in play.  That's a risky situation (not always, but there's higher chances of complications), so a doctor does need to take a look at the situation."
197,"&gt;  I think it is me overacting tho

Yeah, not really. You need to take a long, hard look at things and get your house in order. Your boyfriend should not be your sole support. It's an exhausting task that's a breeding ground for resentment and eventual infidelity. This is probably why he's escaping with a fantasy relationship with a co-worker. I'm not trying to excuse his behavior, mind you, I'm just trying to explain it."
198,"Exactly this. I'm on the chubby side myself, and am more comfortable in one piece suits. Personally, I'd be *furious* if anyone was told not to wear a bikini around me, because that's putting shame on me that I don't feel.  I wonder if any of this request is coming from his sister? Because it sounds like the boyfriend is just assuming the sister will be unhappy (or, like others have mentioned, is using it as an excuse to stop OP from wearing something he doesn't want her to)."
199,"I don't think anything backfired at all. If you hadn't brought all this up, you would still be suffering and never getting what you want. Its not like if you'd stayed and ""behaved"" more to his liking, you would have gotten what you want. You would have just gotten more of the same, and maybe even less as time went on. And it would have been completely reasonable for him to never meet those needs, because he's just trying to be with someone who can live life the way he wants. If you went along with that it would have been your fault."
200,"Can you explain why it's important to you? I personally want to keep my last name because there are only daughters in our family, and our family's been through a lot of drama over the last few years, so I want to keep my maiden name as a sign of respect to my dad, who will be living alone probably within a few years. It's important to me to keep my last name, and it's also important that I talk to my fiancé about it, so if it's that important to you, then you need to talk to her more deeply about it. Maybe then you guys will see a little more eye to eye on this issue. Overall, though, is it really worth losing the person you love over the last name? I feel like you're seeing only the trees and missing the forest."
201,"Have you considered asking her why keeping her name is important to her?

She's a human being and your equal, not a possession. It's HER NAME and if she wants to change it, fine. If she doesn't, fine. 

I also don't get what duration of residence has to do with it. Would you take her name if her family had been in the country longer? 

I assume the kids will have your last name regardless, so it's not like she's preventing your family name from surviving. 

You're coming off as controlling and rigid. "

203,"This might be slightly impacted by cultural considerations.  In UK dating culture, there is no such thing as ""multi-dating"", or ""defining the relationship"".  There is an **implicit expectation of exclusivity from the very beginning of dating someone**.  

From October to November (when you last slept with your FWB), your online GF would have had the expectation of complete and utter fidelity.  As far as she is concerned, you have cheated on her, at the very start of a relationship where you are supposed to be interested in her.

I echo the other commenters that suggest relationship counselling because you two seem to have very different expectations of life, love, and relationships.  Also if you've just got married it would be good to have a third party to guide you through typical relationship issues (kids, finances, career, elder care etc)

"
204,"This is abuse. You are entitled to do whatever the fuck you want with your life whether or not he approves. He's probably been slowly tightening his hold for years. I have seen friends in the same situation desperately snapping pictures of themselves everywhere they go to prove their whereabouts to suspicious jealous boyfriends. Its never ok, and a major red flag. Get out before he traps you in your house for fear of being accused again."
205,"He knew you would be upset about him receiving a lap dance and yet he STILL did it and he hid it from you. Like seriously? 

If he really thought there would be no problem with a lap dance he wouldn't have been secretive about it. 

There are many people who would agree that their boyfriend receiving a lap dance is a deal breaker and something you do not do. You are not the only one that thinks this was wrong.

I would reconsider the relationship because he lied to you, and because he did something he knew you wouldn't be okay with. "
206,"Did you ask him why he specifically wants a celebrity though? That sounds unrealistic and even immature for someone his age. I'm sure he'd be happy with meeting anyone he has a connection with though, but dating sites can be bad, even Tinder is a little iffy. Does he ever go out on days off where he might be able to meet someone that's single?"
207,"I've seen you ask this question a couple times OP so I thought I'd answer too. 

On the weekends, In most families with young children everyone just hangs out until the kids go to bed. Chores, yard work, shopping, and trips to the park are all pretty common activities. Parents talk, cook, clean, and play with the kids together. 

It would be exhausting for every weekend to be an exciting production and whirlwind of activities. 

Weeknights, parents make dinner, talk, hang out with the kiddo and play as a family until bedtime. Bedtime is usually around 7-8:30 and after that the adults hang out together or have alone time until bed. 

I don't have my own kids but in every family with kids that I've spent time with that's how it goes 90% of the time.

210,"Agree completely that the only-child thing sounds like a bad excuse. It's like when I read on this sub that ""Im depressed and have anxiety issues and I'm working on it but in the meantime I treat my partner like crap."" Being depressed does not mean you have to be a terrible person. Being an only child certainly gave OP a different upbringing than other people but he is fully in control of his behavior. If he isn't happy with the situation he's in, he should end the relationship, or work to improve on things if he chooses to stay. Two unhappy partners is not going to work out, if she isn't getting what she needs, and he just wants to be left alone. "

I'm fine with my girlfriend's exes or whatever, but I wouldnt feel comfortable meeting any one night stands if she has had them. As I'm sure she wouldn't feel comfortable meeting my one night stands. Relationships are a two way road, consider how you would feel if you were exposed to your boyfriend's hookups on a daily basis. You should try to limit contact with some of your past hookups, that said, he should do his part too and not react like a child in these situations. It just makes him look petty and insecure"
213,"How about you tell him ""stop asking me if I've slept with someone after you meet a guy."" That is creepy and weird and he's being incredibly immature. "
214,"It is not illogical or irrational to keep in mind that the individual members of your workforce are actually human beings when you speak about them, or to acknowledge your SO has feelings and opinions which may be different than your own.

You're using 'rationality' as an excuse for not doing the basic work of being respectful of the human beings around you. It's a common tacit, and it's not okay. It's emotionally and intellectually lazy.

You are lacking some basic empathy skills here. It's possible to both make sound business decisions, and recognize that people aren't horses or show dogs, and that your girlfriend has legitimate reasons to not appreciate hearing women spoken about as though they are livestock. "

218,"We have a lot in common. My situation is very similar to yours. Although my ""baby daddy"" and I weren't married, we did live together. I was overwhelmed, not supported and had festering resentment. I had a small mental break due to years of too much on my plate, loneliness and feeling trapped. He refused to leave. Long story short. We are now apart, I am a single mom doing 99% of the parenting while he is more of the ""fun uncle"". But I am much happier now. I want to give you a hug too because you sound like an amazing person. You husband has it too good. No wonder he wants to stay married to you. Forget your family/ friends opinion. Being a single mom can be a nice life. Better than feeling lonely, overwhelmed and unsupported. You deserve better. "
219,The lack of current employment dings any applicant's chances by 40% or so. Months and months of a job search kill your financial situation and psyche.
220,"That's awesome. If you're showing her how much you can do for the kids the next step is showing her what you can do for her. 

Ask her about her career ambitions. Suggest she sign up for classes. Even if she's worn out, I'm assuming she loves the mom thing in general since she planned four. So maybe look up and suggest degrees that she can get mainly online and are shorter duration. 

If her goal is to be out of the house only part time, spending money on a four year degree might not make sense. There are a lot of two year degrees that make good money, especially if she has any interest in computers/tech/anything medical. 

Finally, a separation doesn't mean no contact. Maybe don't press for date nights, but a weekly dinner sounds reasonable. "
221,"More than that. My mom's boss has one. She spends close to $300 a month for him, because he has skin conditions on top of eating $150 worth of food. He is close to 130 pounds and still has some more growing to do."

224,"It's quite reasonable that he would be annoyed about you giving away something of his without asking him. You had no right to decide whether he didn't need something anymore. Imagine if someone went through your things and gave away something they felt you didn't need anymore because you hadn't used it for a while or had bought a newer version? You're going to have to realise what you did wrong here, but it doesn't seem like you feel you've done anything wrong and are surprised he's reacted like this. Maybe he's more annoyed about that than the actual giving away?"
225,"If it were just a matter of conflict resolution skills, I'd say go to couples therapy and learn how to communicate better, and then I'd recommend some books.

But it's not.  You're dating someone who you cannot trust to stop doing what he's doing to your body when you say ""no.""  He violated you repeatedly.  He not only doesn't care about your feelings, but he doesn't respect your agency to control what happens to your body.

This guy does not respect you, he does not respect your boundaries, and he treats you like an object that doesn't get to make choices about its own body. He is not going to magically start treating you like a human being deserving of respect once he learns how to communicate.  So let him go.  Find someone who respects you and who you can trust to respect your agency."

I have a friend who did the same with her brother's ex and she was a bridesmaid in her wedding recently. All I mean is, it might be unlikely. It seems more often than not, the friendship between OP and Ana will also come to an end. However, I hope it does not. Best of luck!"

230,"I think the main thing is to express consistently how much you appreciate everything she does.  That would be really huge.  Feeling appreciated goes a long way.  

Since you can't put in equal time and effort into chores, can you commit to doing one or two chores she hates the most?  For example, I don't mind doing laundry and dishes, but I absolutely hate cleaning the bathroom and putting gas in the car.  Ask her what her most hated chores are.  

Is there any way you could afford for a cleaning service to come in once a week or once every two weeks to do the deep cleaning, like vacuum, clean the bathroom, etc?  It might not cost as much as you think.  

Also, don't forget to make quality time for each other.  The dishes can wait.  Put on a movie, surprise her with her favorite snack, and cuddle on the couch.  Go for a walk.  Play a board game.  Make dinner together.  Whatever you enjoy.  In really busy times, it's easy to fall into roommate-mode.

If you aren't happy with the frequency and quality of your sex life then treat that as its own issue and advocate for what you need there.

If you are dating, you cheated on him in front of his face...not cool. The assumption should always be that something is NOT ok before talking about it. If you're not dating, you technically didn't do anything wrong but it's still kind of a shitty thing to do knowing he has feelings for you. 

Use this as a learning experience about communication and alcohol. Go out of your way to be amazing to him, give him extra blowjob, shower him with compliments and such. He said he forgives you but showing your appreciation of him would probably help him feel better and work to restore trust."
249,"&gt;Reddit, can you give me some opinions? What the hell is going on, am I being paranoid or is my GF being really fucking sketchy? I'm not going to assume she cheated on me exactly without real proof but I think she likes the kid and isn't telling me the whole truth.

Honestly, it's hard to say without hard evidence, but if you made me bet on it, i'd give it better than 50/50 odds that she cheated.

We don't know how much OP and bf have talked about the future, but they are clearly on different pages (she talk about adjusting her plans after college for him) and so it's understandable she would feel hurt. If bf is *aware* she feels that way, then it sounds like he might be taking advantage her by not just breaking it off right there. On the other hand, if OP was planning her future around him without ever discussing it with him then yeah, she shouldn't have gotten carried away before knowing what his intentions were."

254,"For this weekend, the first time she brings it up, I think you should pull over the car and come to a complete stop.  Then tell her that you can either have that conversation or drive her to her thing, but you will not be doing both.  It is a power play, but it is also a safety measure - driving while arguing isn't particularly safe.  

Going forward, I think you should just start leaving when she opens that subject.  Tell her that it sounds like she needs to talk to her son, and then get up and leave.  Make it your boyfriend's problem when she starts that line of questioning by aborting the plans for the day.  

Another tactic might be to start asking her if she has memory loss or other dementia symptoms every time she brings it up.  ""Naya, we talked about this last week.  Are you having trouble rememembering other things?  We should really get you checked out - could be dementia!""  "

Also, *technically* this is your money if he isn't working. That is a kind of very weird view to take about being jealous of his own child getting this future money. It is totally a selfish line of thought. I would not compromise outside of maybe a situation where you pay off your son's loans if he does well in school. However, personally,  I'd tell him that you're starting the 529 plan for him today.

You now know that she has a problem with the size and nature of the collection; continuing to add new items to your collection without her express approval wouldn't be a good idea. 

Were I you, I would discuss alternative/additional safety measures with your wife. Every item needs to be protected by more than just the fact that it's in a locked room (not so much the bows, though; they're harmless without arrows). Some cool cases and lighting could even enhance the collection! 

I would also stop just ""stopping into"" the LGS (local gun store?); at this point, you know that the owner ""always seems"" to have something for you, so you must have noticed a pattern by now--you buy something when you go there. **Don't add anything else to the collection until you and your wife are both 100% comfortable with this.**"

273,"You guys are young and this is an important thing for people to learn in their early relationships. If this remains a problem throughout adulthood, your partner is going to have a bad time.

She was probably raised or is used to relationship dynamics that had a lot of withholding and little verbal or physical affection. In those environments, fighting and disagreements are all about who gives in first, you become too prideful or just plain don't understand that in a romantic relationship you CHOOSE to be in, it benefits no one to hold grudges. You have to cater to their needs just as much as they cater to yours, it's give and take. It sounds like she doesn't yet understand that you show love by showing compassion to your partner, and it can't always be about how your feelings were hurt.

I was the same way when I was younger, it took a lot of introspection to grow out of it. Then again, I also did not have any partners that pointed this out to me, they just assumed (like you are probably doing) that I should know and it was something I was choosing to do just because I was mean or crazy.

You were in town for Christmas, but refused to come into their home to open presents they bought for you because you just got out of an abusive relationship?

It's not a matter of hiding masculinity. The root of the issue is the misconception that being friends first is the best/only way to get to know someone because the end goal is to be in a relationship with someone who you consider your best friend.  

What the ""friends first"" people don't realize is that dating *is* a way to get to know someone, but with dating you've also made your romantic intentions and physical attraction known from the beginning. Neither way is ""wrong,"" but with the dating approach you are being honest and upfront with your intentions and less likely to fall into the same situation as OP."

My boyfriend didn't try in high school and got by with. 3.6 while I busted my ass and got a 4.2. I guess I thought I was smarter but then we went into the same major and I realized things were just easier for him. He'd study less and do well while I struggled. But instead of getting bitter about it, I encouraged him to apply to a doctoral program (which I wanted to do also) and he got in easily while I've been told by my advisors that I'm no where near good enough. It's a blow to my self-esteem because I work hard but suffer through depression and financial problems so I feel like I'm underachieving and like I'm failing. But he's in a good place without the level of worry and stress I've experienced and that just makes me happy. Happy that one of us has our life together and will be successful. I'm sure I'll make it somehow but this whole time I thought I would become a doctor and make more than him when it's now the other way around.

I definitely get annoyed because I feel like I deserve something too but I'm not upset at him. I just don't see how you can be mad that the person you love the most is doing well. Would you be mad at your kid for growing up with more opportunities and finding more success than you did? 

Try to frame it in a different way. My bf says that he wouldn't be where he is without the push I gave him, making his class schedules, keeping deadlines and encouraging him to apply. Maybe that's true but either way, I know he would have succeeded. But it does make me feel better that all of my efforts and planning has helped one of us.

I think it's great for the OP to start laying groundwork for more independence now, and I also suggest some very frank discussions about establishing boundaries for your mother's behavior when you go off to college, because a lot of controlling helicopter parents try to use paying for college as a way to continue to make all your decisions for you, and in your own self-interest as a person trying to develop into an adult, you cannot let that happen."
319,"You've said that you've tried this, and she ignores you. Therefore it is his issue. His mother is being aggressively, antagonisingly anti-social here (imagine how awful she'd be as a mother-in-law... best to set boundaries early). He is letting it happen so that he can avoid the awkwardness of telling off his mother, and is making you suffer instead.

He needs to step up and take responsibility. A relationship is a team, and he's not on your team. He's on his mother's team.

Everything you've said to us needs to be said to him, and if he refuses to take your problem seriously then he's seriously lacking in respect for you. 

Will he continue to take her side through the marriage? Putting a ring on won't change his behaviour, marriage is a not a 'fix' for a broken relationship dynamic. You may find yourself married to *her* rather than him, for the way that whatever she says becomes whatever he says."
320,"No. Just no.

I had NO sex drive for a year after having my son. Sure, being exhausted, having leaky boobs, and still having baby weight didn't help. But all of that could have been fixed and I still wouldn't have wanted to sleep with my sons dad.

At 1 year I stopped breast feeding and that helped, a lot. By 18 months I was back to normal. If OP's baby turns 2 and this is an issue still then sure you're probably right. But right now she's completely normal."

324,"When you talk to him tonight, find a way to highlight the difference between running away from a problem (""I don't want to talk about this EVER"") and taking space to cool down (""I don't want to talk about this RIGHT NOW""). Point out that the reason you're trying to take space is BECAUSE you know it will go badly if you are pushed into a conversation right away--and lo and behold, it does! You end up shouting and arguing instead of discussing! Exactly what you're trying to avoid!

That ""I'm sorry I let you bait me"" comment, holy SHIT that's some next level manipulative blame-placing shit. If this is abnormal for him, then it might be worth discussing--things like ""in what way is saying I DON'T want an argument right now while you follow me around the house trying to have an argument, me baiting you into an argument?"" and ""The words ""I'm sorry"" do not an apology make if they're followed up by making it clear that you don't think you did anything wrong."" But if this kind of manipulation and refusal to take responsibility is normal for him, you need more than a conversation about it, counseling is a best case scenario.

Finally, after tonight's discussion, in the moment when he wants to argue and you want to cool down, try giving him a time when you'll discuss the thing. ""I need [ten minutes, an hour, a day] to be ready for this conversation. Please give me some space and we can discuss it [time]."" Or ""Before I can have this conversation I need to do X. After I've done X, let' talk about it."" X should be either something you're doing/willing to start doing right now, or something at a fixed time, so it's clear X is not an excuse to put the discussion off indefinitely."

Also, this part

&gt;We had a discussion about it and I told her I don't mind the occasional time going out with friends and doing it but I am not okay with her using it as a general boredom or tiredness cure. She claims that ""so its okay when its on my terms but not on hers"".

is exactly true.

It would be one thing if you said you were concerned about the frequency of her usage, and wanted her to cut back. But you're not saying that. You're saying *this* and *this* are ok because you say so, and *that* and *that* aren't, because you say so. That's not cool. That's not cool, no matter what particular activity you're talking about.

Ultimately, though, I don't think you have a leg to stand on in asking her to change. You knew who she was and what she did when you two started dating. You can, and probably should, give her an ultimatum that unless she cuts down on her illegal drug use the relationship can't continue, but be prepared to pound sand when she chooses her preexisting habits over you."

332,"Yeah, act like his request was no big deal, and your no was also a simple matter. The only reason this becomes an issue is if one of you makes it into one and it doesn't sound like he is doing that.

Think of it like he asked you if he could eat the last piece of cake and you said no. Sure, he wanted a different answer, but it's probably not keeping him awake at night. And I could be wrong, but I've been in similar situation before and let me tell you, there is a pretty high chance he asked you out just so he could stop thinking about whether or not he should. So even though you told him no, in his mind, a solid no was better than not asking the question."

334,No she didn't. The person above is implying that no decent man will be ok with this. That's incorrect.
335,Seriously it sounds like she is the only person with the problem. She sounds like a freaking pain in the arse to share an office with. 
336,This sub is generally pretty anti cigarettes so I highly doubt it. I would wager most people commenting don't smoke. Dismissing everyone as salty 15 year olds is a cheap cop out. We just understand that there's not much she can do. She chose to live in a building that allows smoking.

339,"It kinda sounds like you were stringing her along.  You didn't want to commit, she did and you still hung out with her anyways.  You both weren't exclusive and you had your freedom.  The flip side of that is she's a free agent as well.  If she wants an exclusive relationship, she'll probably look eslewhere.  Sorry, bud."
340,"Oh bullshit. His kink involves washing her undies in secret without her consent. That's creepy as fuck. Even if it's not a kink, it's fucking creepy. She didn't agree to it so what he is doing is WRONG AND CREEPY.

342,So? Just because she has the money doesn't mean she's obligated to spend it on you.
343,Sex problems a year in at 23? Personally I don't think life should be a death march to finding the first person to be miserable with. It's a lot easier and more fulfilling to work through issues with someone who can actually treat you with respect and is more or less on the same page as you to begin with. Sex is supposed to be fun.
344,"FFS, a surfboard is not a toy, it's sporting equipment. When did you become so negative? "
345,"Yes, please seek therapy, OP!! You can go for free with your college stuff, so take advantage of that. You are at high risk for abusive relationships. Take this opportunity to get yourself sorted out and figure out how to respect yourself!!"
346,"&gt; But I've noticed that they have a weird family independently of whether I was already in love with them or not, and I don't think it's forbidden to notice stuff about people.

 In the gentlest possible way, OP, have you ever taken a college-level psychology course? If you have, your prof did you a great disservice, and if you haven't, I'd highly recommend one. 

For one thing, you're using scientifically-invalid classifications for people. The MBTI is called a ""horoscope for intellectuals"" because it has about as much analytical worth as astrology. Which is to say zero. (Short summary: it dichotomizes traits which actually exist on a spectrum.) Plenty of people have weird families; you-- a layperson--can't say anything definitive about their attachment styles based on what they tell you re: their parents. 

Likewise, you don't really have the tools to assess emotional shallowness or depth. Nobody does! So much of a person's emotional life happens beneath the surface that you really have no comparative insight here. And, for what it's worth, modern psychology concerns itself with inappropriate expressions of feeling, not capacity for feeling. 

As for your own suspected narcissism, get thyself to therapy. I know that you're already going, but have you directly asked your psychologist/psychiatrist (and for this, it really should be a person with the legal authority to diagnose mental illnesses in your country) to give you the barrage of tests? Speculating about yourself using bad science is likely to scare, not help you. 

&gt;I don't ""target"" anyone.

I was unclear here. I don't mean ""target"" like some sort of love-seeking missile. I mean that you don't disengage. As soon as you find yourself falling into the thought-patterns that cause you so much grief, you should back out of the relationship. Like you did with Person #2, but earlier. 

Good luck out there, OP! You seem to have a lot of stuff going on, and most of it is up to you to solve.

349,It seems like a non issue now if they don't want to hang out anymore
350,Two weeks ago I was sleeping next to my bf and woke up to the pain of him biting my neck SUPER hard. He then rolled over and went right to sleep like nothing happened. The next morning I woke up and I too thought it was a dream until I saw my neck. My bf has absolutely no recollection of doing this and we both got kind of a good laugh from it. I asked him if he's ever slept walked and he said he had but not in a long time. I think that these are both related to sleep walking as it's just too weird in my opinion to be anything else. 
351,I think there's no way to avoid feeling the feelings unless you take unhealthy measures. I am in the midst of the dissolution of my 17 year marriage and I can tell you that the feelings fucking suck but the only way out is through. Resolve to be kind to yourself and do what you have to do to get through this in a healthy way. I'm trying to figure that out myself so I feel for you.
352,"I'd say no. Which your gut is already telling you. 

She already has a payment plan to pay the lawyers (A), but she wants you to help out so she owes you (B) instead. A or B she owes someone, unless she is hoping to fluff off or not prioritize the loan you would be giving her. 

Half the small claim disputes are loans between exes or friends/family and one side is usually pulling the ""but it was my bf/gf it was a gift"" card. 

Your grandfather was right, it sucks but the rule I use lending out money is I only do it with the hope of seeing it again but low expectation I ever will. Otherwise I just say no, because if someone is having money troubles how are they ever going to catch up?"
353,"In general i would say that she shouldn't be watching your kid if she isn't comfortable with this-even though if she has such a big problem with kids I don't get why she wanted to be a godmother. However, she gets to live with you for long periods,rent-free and without contributing in any way. The least she could do is stay with your sleeping child when you get to grab groceries-which she will enjoy for free. But anyway, those are two different problems. She should be contributing more and you must ask her or you will end up resenting her."
354,"&gt; WHERE is his money going if he doesn't contribute and he makes more than you? Is he on drugs? Drinking?

Yep. My thoughts exactly."
355,"You can say more, but it's not going to do anything. She was abusive. She still is. She's using him and she won't stop until she either drains him dry or she drops dead. Meanwhile, he's an enabler, and while he's not as responsible as her, he's still a bad father.

If he wouldn't stand up to her to protect his children when they were young and vulnerable and in desperate need of help from their father, he isn't going to be any better now that you're all independent adults."
356,[deleted]
357,"I agree with all your points except pulling the ""I'm the bread winner"" card. I mean, he's taking care of their child for free -- they'd have to pay for that if not for him. She's not paying him a salary for it, nor should she, but in this situation when two partners choose to have one work and the other care for the kids, the money earned by the worker is seen as both of theirs.  And in communal property states like California, it is legally both of theirs. It just is a dick move to bring that up and goes against their previous agreement about one spouse working and the other caring for the kids. "
358,"It would help to know what state you're in, but nevertheless try the cities Reddit page. After blindly moving to Austin the group really helped me learn about the culture and widely accepted norms of the city.

360,"For me, it was when I went to bed and realized I had an entire bed to myself. I no longer had to share it with that asshole. It still feels luxurious. Please, OP, leaving will hurt like absolute fire, but it will be so worth it. "
361,"Wow.  Yeah, see...these are definitely things he should have expressed earlier on.  Perhaps he didn't see your relationship growing too serious until one day it hit him that he was in too deep.

I totally understand being upset that he doesn't want to get married, but will do it for you.  That makes the institution of marriage feel less special.  This can be worked through.  However, what really concerns me is that he basically said you guys should break up 3 times.  WTF is that about?  Why is that his go-to response here?  

Do you feel he is wholly committed to you and your relationship? Do you see you two having the same life goals and being able to accomplish them together?  Have you discussed children?  These are the things that really matter.  If you are't on the same page with these things then the marriage talk is moot."
362,"Nah, end it. He's still in love with this girl. He went behind your back twice about it. Then had the nerve to ask his brother to lie to you. "

365,"What I don't quite ""get"" : were OP to have found out that it would be physically impossible for her to have more children, and her husband were 're-evaluating' the relationship because of that, *even already having one child*, I imagine she'd be getting nothing but sympathy here.

What she's stated isn't actually too far from that. The impacts on her mentally and physically were just too much for her, affecting her life negatively to this day, and she *can't* do it again, for her physical and mental health. And he's considering leaving her, the woman whom he supposedly loves, and splitting up *their child's* family because he just has to have another. 

Replace ""I'm physically and mentally exhausted and I can't do it"" with ""I'm having fertility issues"" and he sounds like a downright arse. Why is this so different?

I promise I'm not trying to be a troll or a jerk. I honestly don't understand."

369,"Yep, a lot of guys brag about how they just looove going down on girls because they think it makes them sound good in bed or whatever. It's either a line or they're unwittingly lying to themselves because they don't yet have enough experience to know how they really feel about it. 

It's like how some people brag about how much they love sex but when they actually get into a relationship they barely have a libido. "
370,"You might want to try a 15-30 minute of ""electronics free"" activities, including moving the phones to other areas so you wont be tempted to respond to messages or things like that.

It's not about what YOU can keep up. *She* doesn't think she can keep this up.

 You don't change that by insisting that you're happy so she needs to be. You change that by figuring out *why* she is unhappy and *fixing it*.

You get her to be okay with you needing downtime by figuring out *why isn't she okay with it now*. 

If she needs more quality time with you- how do you get it?

If she's burnt out- how does *she* get down time?

If she feels it's worth making sacrifices so you can stay home more often- how do you make those sacrifices?

If there's a different problem- what is the solution?"

373,"I had to double check your age.  You make it sound like you were young and vibrant and interested in your first kids, but now you're old, old, old and run down, and not into it with the new one.

My dad had 3 grown kids, a couple of grandkids, and was in his 50s when I came along.  When I came along,  my dad was all about me.  He made me things, he took me places, he spent time with me.  

Your wife is hurt by your behavior.  I guarantee this poor kid will feel like you don't love them if you keep up with this ""I'm old and tired, plus busy with my other kids"" bullshit.  It'll cause a rift between this child and their older half siblings.  Your wife will resent you and her step-kids too.  

You need to reasses your priorities. If your kids take up so much of your focus and energy, you should have spared your poor wife and let her find someone who actually was interested in her and her needs, and in being a decent father to her child."

376,"His behavior is all about what he wants.

He's not making the bench.

He's not going to the parenting class.

He's not fussing over the baby on the way."
377,"That ten years makes a huge difference too. I didn't think I needed the birth classes the second time around, and boy was I wrong! "
378,"So in your post history you mention trying to find a hook up in somebody's house or car. But they gotta be cool with you bringing your baby.

For the love of your children, seriously consider abortion for this one and adoption for the oldest because you frankly sound too selfish and immature to parent effectively. You know nothing about these hookups, yet you take your child that is unable to defend him/herself with you so that you can have 27 minutes of fun time. 

You are gambling with the lives of other people. Your partners, you, your children, all because you are so pathetically guided by some misguided idea that screwing a rando will somehow fix whatever issues and loneliness you have. 

Parenting is about more than providing the bare minimum. Children need food, shelter, and healthcare. But they also need stability, love, and safety. And currently you are apparently broke, and you aren't providing any sort of stability. Hopping from one guy to the next isn't going to create a family. It's just going to create more kids you can completely mess up and that's not fair to the kids. 

Tl;dr: sort your mental issues out and stop dragging innocent children into your shit decisions. Go to Planned Parenthood and actually use your head for once to have sex like a responsible adult. "

384,"It wouldn't allow me to see his messages but it would allow me to vote on issues he couldn't vote on. Your message really hit home with me and is encouraging me to stand my ground. I've asked him to concede because I always am the one to concede. He threatened to leave me. I said take some time to think about it and let me know if you'll concede this one. He left the house, not sure where he went. I'm shaking but I'm standing my ground. This does not harm him in any way. "
385,"I have a friend just like you,  list of requirements for men she'll date.  She's 45, single,  never married,  never had a relationship last past six months. She is desperately lonely and cries on Facebook all the time about how there are ""no nice guys"", but when she finally meets a great guy, she drives him away with her insane demands, saying ""but I DESERVE the best!"" 

She has a hard,  hard life.  You will too,  I'm sorry to say.  I hope you mature a little and learn to bend. "
386,"Her family has also been carrying that name since it came into existence.

I would also say that since your issue is about that heritage and you two intend to have children, you need to talk about names for the kids. Maybe she would be agreeable to keeping her name and giving yours to the kids or maybe you could all hyphenate.

What is your personality like? What are your personal flaws? What do you present on the first date? Not just the good things or what a person can't argue against. Enjoying movies isn't the reason you aren't getting a second date.

Aside from your personality, you should rework your approach to dating. It sounds like all your dates center around drinks and conversation, and that isn't working out for you. So try something different. Go do something with your date. Go to an art show, take a cooking class, go skydiving. Something. You can always have coffee/drinks/food after. Try to do something interesting you can bond with your date over."
392,"Plus the funeral for mother, should be about mother and her friends. It just so happens some of mother's friends are also OPS exs"
393,"It is definitely creepy, disrespectful to you, and perhaps to them.  Not to defend him in anyway, but I did have a similar phase in my mid-teens (16ish), although that was 10+ years ago and before the advent of streaming, all-access internet porn so might be inapplicable.  Regardless, its likely rooted in fantasy, akin to using your imagination.  I would ask him to stop and see what he says.  If you are already sexually incompatible and he is unwilling to drop a habit that makes you uncomfortable, then you may want to consider ending it.  However, remember that he most likely finds this sexually exciting/erotic because he its somewhat ""taboo"" and he isn't supposed to be doing it, so you barring him from doing it may make it even more taboo to him."
394,"This relationship was a mess.  I feel like it started out of convenience, you offered him a place to live, and he took it.  He has been living with you because he does not have the ability to live on his own.  Has he ever held a stable job?  Why is he not able to find decent work and contribute?  The fact that he took money out of your account regularly is a huge breach of trust.  You are already providing him with everything, and he would take more from you, instead of working more?  Do you really want a partner like this?

I also don't blame him for walking away.  It did get physical, and that is inexcusable.  Being drunk is not an excuse for your erratic behavior.  

You both need to work on yourselves and are better off alone.  There's nothing to salvage here."

396,"&gt;never when she is on her period

You're writing like you think her period is when she is fertile. You mention it in the main post too. She's actually *less* likely to get pregnant from period sex than other times. "
397,"&gt; That's also not the first time I've said no/expressed discomfort and he's continued.

Your boyfriend is raping you, repeatedly.  There is zero reason to stay and every reason to leave.  HE KNOWS he hurts you and he does NOT CARE.

Please find a way out IMMEDIATELY.  And please consider filing charges.  He has been repeatedly raping you and he may do it to someone else.  Find counselling as well, it would be really helpful.

I'm so sorry you're going through all this.  I've been there.  Once you leave and get help, things will improve.  Hugs."
398,"Just run. The fall out from the end of her relationship is going to be ugly, she's attaching herself to SO - after all she's older now, he's her son, he'll take care of her. I almost feel sorry for the guy. If you want to keep having sex with him, just make sure it's on your terms. That's the only thing mommy can't provide for him. Seriously this is textbook MIL behavior. It's like there's a template. I wish you the best of luck and you probably should check out r/justnoMIL if only to see what you're missing. "
399,"Source:  I've coached / mentored hundreds of startups &amp; teams.  I'm also a female executive who thinks that women can ""have everything"".

Your boss is right here.  A company at your stage is a completely different game than an established corporation.  If you worked at Google, your relationship would be a reasonable thing to make your boss deal with.

However, for early stage companies, the company _is_ the leadership.  Furthermore, early stage companies experience an incredible amount of external stress-- the ups and downs of business can be sudden and brutal.  

To succeed, it's absolutely vital to have a robust team.  When you introduce the relationship factor in, it creates not only a source of potential instability, but potentially a source of future non-resilience.  If I were your boss, even if I loved the two of you to death, I also would not want you to date if I was very serious about putting you both on executive-track.  At least, not until the company has 200+ people.

Ultimately, the limit to your view on this comes precisely because you are not an executive _yet_-- your ""grey solution"" works for the _present moment_, but it doesn't manage future business risk, which is what executives have to do.  What happens when tensions are high?  Your boss may have a lot of ways to explain his reasoning, but the fact is that a typically startup doesn't have the buffer to absorb something as complicated as two senior people in a serious relationship.  Even C/D-stage startups of hundreds of people will typically put two people in a relationship in separate divisions.

I also advise you to choose the career opportunity.  Of course, the most important thing is for you to do right by your life priorities.  However, the majority of female professionals do not end up with the person they are dating at 23 (even if it does feel like the love of their life), and also the majority of female professionals do not get a chance like this one.  

Furthermore, as you pursue this, don't put your boss in the position of giving you an ultimatum.  It will be awkward and potentially harmful to the relationship (not because of anything on your side, but because most people have a hard time doing that sort of thing, so something inside has to change).  Instead, give him space and make your decision :-)  (Knowing that it is, in fact, discrimination if he chooses not to promote you because of who you are dating, but taking that adversarial position is of course pretty counterproductive.)

Lastly, as a minor note, it always throws up a yellow flag for me when someone says, ""and there's discussion that they might give me equity"".  If a company is professional, conversations about equity should be very clear and crisp, and should not be introduced before leadership is prepared to move on it.  Don't ever let someone lead you on with insinuations about equity, pin them down and say, ""can we identify exactly what has to happen for me to earn it?"" and get it in writing.  

Depending on the country and industry you're in, it can also be unusual that he wants to tap an employee for the board of directors.  Usually, these are very different roles-- senior leadership runs the company, and the board brings in external resources and provides high-level strategic guidance.  If your board is making most of the strategic decisions for the company, this could just be a cultural difference.  But if you're anything like a standard tech company, this could also be a yellow flag.


You've got this!!  Good luck!"
400,"To be fair, none of this is about sexuality. It's about gender identity.

But the basic feel is right. It's none of her damn business and she needs to F right off."
401,"Ug, no.  He doesn't seem to consider your needs at all."
402,"I mean, there's a lot missing here, like context. You're upset about her lying, but it's important to know *why* she was lying. If she's just a liar who lies about everything, then that's a red flag. But the things you've listed that she's lied about... well, they're things that are technically none of your business and they are intimate details about her private sex life. Maybe she's lying about those things because she isn't comfortable talking about them and she (rightly) does not feel it's any of your business.

I'm wondering how exactly all this came up. I'm much older than you and have been in a lot of relationships - and never *once* has the ""scope"" of any of my past relationships come up in conversation with my new partners. Nobody has asked me, nor have I volunteered to talk, about what sex acts I have participated in in the past, and with whom. It's because those things are nobody's business but mine and are completely irrelevant to my present relationship. So what I want to ask you is how these things came up in conversation. Did you grill her about her previous sex life? I kind of get the idea that you might have, given your obvious sexual insecurity (being insecure about a vibrator is pretty extreme insecurity). 

If is the case that she lied because you won't lay off with the questioning about her past, then it's justifiable, because dude, it's none of your business, and she's not required to talk about it with you or answer your questions.

Honestly the red flags here are coming from *you*, not from her. I don't know if I personally could date someone who got all bent out of shape because I like to masturbate. Everyone is entitled to their dealbreakers, but being insecure about a vibrator tells me someone has some pretty deep-seated issues they haven't dealt with.

My advice is, get your own issues sorted out before you try and make a relationship with someone. This one is headed for disaster if you keep blaming her for your own insecurities."
403,"She almost certainly can't. He has parental rights, his child can't just be adopted away from them without his input."
404,"Yes this case is too late to be saved with good communication. It sounds like you have tried and he just blames you for his shortcomings.

406,"She sees us living in a house in the near future and getting married and being a stay at home mom. She also expects to have endless amounts of money to shop and eat out. It's like she had this vision that as soon as I graduated and got a job then we'd be set and she could stay at home and we'd still be rich. She was poor growing up so i guess she thinks that someone with a college degree and a career would be able to support her and our family without her working. That's just not the reality for us. Yes my job sounds good on paper but it's still an entry level job and I really don't make enough to live a life that she wants. She's more ready than me to get a house but we simply just can't afford it right now. Both of my parents went to college and have careers so that's always what I expected. In my opinion, it takes 2 incomes to live a financially secure life, especially with kids and the house with the white picket fence. "
407,"You're underage and that means your guardian do get a say so in some of your life. That's just a fact. Social media can be used to expression yoursself and that would be wrong to try to control, but using a social media with your face and name to contact someone you know irl is not that. This is your guardian stating that this is an inappropiate person for you to be in contact with. That this contact is via social media is not a argument you can use to get around that.

This adult women was sexual with a child, so you'll have difficulty finding someone that thinks her having further access to that child is a good idea. Most anyone would think this is a reasonable restriction for a guardian to set.

I get that you liked seeing boobs and think that your social media should be only yours to control, but there is a larger context here. So be sad that you won't get more suprise boobs from this girl, but let it go. Your guardian havn't wronged you and they will certainly never back down on this, so trying to fight it will only cause more issues for you anyway.

And so single moms are very careful to minimize the impact of the kid on their bf &amp; not ask anything ""extra"" until the relationship is aged and serious.  
   
But when a guy becomes a single dad it can be like a slap in the face because ""women love kids"" and the rejections are totally unexpected.  Or he starts dating someone and they balk when he involves the kid, he can't understand why it's an issue.  
   
Just another example of how ""men are shallow in dating, women are caring and understanding"" stereotypes hurt all parties.  "
411,"Maybe he asked her to do it and it wasn't something she found to be amazing. A handful of times isn't that many, so she probably isn't into it that much. Also how is she automatically going to assume you would want to do that? Not every couple does, hence why communication is a thing."
412,"&gt; She already has two kids and some people think guys won't datewomen with kids.

Yes, and in all honesty a woman who had two kids with two different men will have an even harder time finding a new partner :/"
413,"He's paying for her tuition, I really doubt she can just up and buy what could be more than 1k in figurines lol. Yeah OP really needs to get them back and stop feeling entitled to her boyfriends wallet. "
414,"See, there you go.  She has little to no say in the raising of this child. Any level of input she has has to be done in private with your full review. And the then you wonder why she has checked out.  This explains the animosity with your ex. 

Adult/child relationships are a two way streets. You've set up a shitload of detours and tolls in her direction and wonder why she elects to not even attempt the trip. 

Being in a relationship with a single parent is not easy in the best of circumstances. I think you're making it even harder.  "
415,"I don't know her, but I will tell you that if someone kissed another person, you can fess up to that. You cut an entire group out of your life when there is something else that happened. Reading this just screams that something else happened.

Show up in person to the other guy, and tell him your GF told you everything. And you mean *everything*. But he deserves the chance to explain it himself. Don't give him a chance to text or call your GF. If he says they kissed, then double down. ""No, she told me EVERYTHING, and I want to hear your side as to how you could do that to me, to [his GF]."" (this will be especially effective if they are still together). ""I want to hear it from you, right now.""

At this point he will either tell you they slept together or he will stick to his guns. You can either double down or accept his story, but it should go for at least a few rounds unless you get more info. Regardless, when you go back to your GF, regardless of what he said, you tell her that he told you they had sex. Tell her you went and met up with him, and he told you everything. She has one chance to tell you the entire truth; if hers and dude's don't match then you should leave."
416,"Well he doesnt have to live alone, just not with this shithead"
417,What about the *entire human lives you are creating recklessly and under-providing for*
418,"I wouldn't go. You don't talk and you will have to close your business for the weekend. You could just send a gift and say unfortunately we are not able to come, congratulations"
419,"Hey man I've been sober 5.5 years and dated a ton my first 2 years off sobriety and not in the rooms (stopped because I got into a relationship here). I used online dating and told them up front I was sober. It was super fun. 

Two other pieces of advice. One, if you go into any situation on the hunt you will come off as someone with an ulterior motive and that's a turnoff. Don't go to salsa or cooking class to hook up with someone, go because you honestly want to dance or cook and if you meet someone, fine. Let go and let God.

Second, remember that one of our major malfunctions is that we really don't know what id's good for us. This continues into sobriety. Some of these judgements and dismissals sound a lot like trying to manage an unmanageable situation. Turn this one over too. Try things that you normally wouldn't and take it all one day at a time.

Good luck and have fun!"
420,"The thing is that now she has had the opportunity to delete said location data. As far as I can tell however you are only able to delete all of it - not single instances. So It will be very clear if she has done so.

Sadly, I can't imagine there is anything realistic that can confirm that she wasn't doing anything wrong. The conversation is deleted and that is the issue. I could ask Tim about it, but that is kind of ridicoulus, and if he says no then of course he might be lying - the only thing I could get from him that worth anything is if he says yes. If cheating was actually happening I imagine she has already spoken with Tim about my confrontation yesterday.

Edit to add:
And even if I get to see location data, emotional cheating might still have been happening, or physical cheating might have been happening at the gym or something. It's really just how she handled the whole thing that makes this so suspicious."
421,This is hilarious. Your girlfriend sucks and you can do way better. 
422,"I know it sounds counterintuitive, but you would have more energy if you made time to exercise. Start with 30 minutes every other day. Just some yoga, even. Bodyweight exercises. No equipment, no need to leave your home, just get yourself moving. It will do wonders. Researchers at the University of Georgia found that sedentary, otherwise healthy adults who engaged in as little as 20 minutes of low-to-moderate aerobic exercise, three days a week for six consecutive weeks, reported feeling less fatigued and more energized."
423,"You are not some grand prize to be had. You ditched the person who you call your only friend in high school. You felt that your new friends were better than him. You crushed him first, why would he want to date you, hell why would he even want a friendship with you after that? "
424,Waaaaaay too soon. You've been back together for 3 months? You need to slow down girly 
425,"As far as finding one, I don't know. I can't tell you which is easier, trying to get over your dislike, or finding a man that *genuinely* is content with living without blow jobs until he dies. They best thing you can do is keep being up front and hoping.  "
426,Probably get downvoted to hell again. But have you ever actually tried doing it? When I was a teen I had the blow jobs are icky mentality. Then I did it and realized I didn't hate it. 
427,"OP really needs to be careful if he does this. It's one thing to have those sorts of ideals, it's another thing to carry them into their professional life. If it comes out down the line that OP's gf can't really handle the workload and he's been helping her, that could put them both in trouble. What if he gets sick or she's asked on the spot for her rationalization for a decision, etc? "
428,He wasn't at all like that when we got married...he says he was on his best behavior when we met and got engaged and then his true personality came out after we got married :/
429,"He's not pretending to be gay lol. 


He is gay. "
430," Nothing. Say thank you for the thoughtful gift. 

There's no need to speak your ""truth"" all the time. Sometimes it is appropriate to shut up and be gracious. "
431,"*""OMG I totes didn't know I was hurting someone when I deliberately planned and executed a scenario with a built in excuse all so I could hurt them physically.""*

Said no bully ever. "
432,yeahhhh this is brutal and so cringey!!
433,"Sometimes i try to tell my friends how mean he is, without getting too much into detail, and they are sympathetic but usually say I'm so lucky who my brother is. So its a mute point with friends. Everyone is just sure he will be famous someday.

I do work on my grades a lot though. I hope I can go to a college out of state and get scholarships."
434,Lemme guess - are you male? This sounds woefully ignorant 
435,"Yeah I agree that if your partner is expecting you home then going out and not coming home without a decent reason is irresponsible. I mean, I get that plans change, sometimes my partner will call me while he is out for dinner with his mates and tell me that all the guys are going out to some new bar, I'm not going to say ""no, you must come home"" unless it really impacts other important plans. 
If she wants to go out and get drunk on a weekend away then that's fine but she should plan accordingly, so that OP can plan around that. 
Calling your partner last minute to say you're drunk and you're not coming home generally is pretty selfish."
436,"She's being insanely irresponsible. Getting drunk with friends at a bar on occasion is one thing, but going to frat parties and doing keg stands is totally into irresponsible and actually sort of dangerous territory. 

Not to mention, even if she did only miss taking their daughter to their mom's, getting plastered to the point where it compromises plans w hubby is, at the minimum, pretty backwards prioritization."
437,Figure out what to do with the apartment and then break up. There's nothing to salvage here. She has frozen you out and doesn't appear to feel any guilt.
438,"Holy crap. My ex is the same! He just dumped me two days ago by blocking me and not saying anything because he's experiencing a crisis with him hating his job. But these type of people always seem to have an existential crisis right? My ex at least every other week. Things would be fine then bam! A joke hurt his feelings or kicked up issues and awkward tense silence for a car ride or during a movie. I know exactly how you feel. Has is been this way for 12 years? My ex in lack of a better term was emotional vampire and it took all of my energy to keep him sane, and mildly happy. It drained my sunny disposition (I have loads of trouble myself as a single income single parent) so our mentalities are just different. If he doesn't get counseling how do you think your happiness will pan out? I wish you luck, 12 years is a long time to deal with someone so emotionally volatile. "
439,"Oh, god...if only they knew that's the last thing we do LOL at least in my case. More along the lines of sitting around in overly-big t-shirts and shorts, stuffing our faces."
440,"It sounds like she needs some serious therapy.  Her illness is not an excuse to be emotionally abusive to anyone.  Treatment for chronic illnesses isn't limited to physical options; the pain is just as much psychological as it is physical.  She needs to learn some internal coping mechanisms.  No one is going to deny how painful and terrible her disease is, but she isn't using all the tools available or recommended. "
441,"&gt;I were OP I would trust her brother to know his own medical information and to communicate it to his sister's fiancé as necessary, you know?

A lot of people don't really know much about CP, so they make the assumption (probably without realizing it in many cases) that because it has ""cerebral"" in it it's a brain disorder, which means impaired brain functions, which mean impaired *cognitive* functions, and the next thing you know they're basically picturing someone with Down syndrome.

Or, alternatively, they actually interact with someone with CP and the physical difficulties with speech make people assume the issue is cognitive impairment.  I think it's unfortunately pretty common for people to treat someone with CP as though they're mentally impaired: talking slowly and loudly, dumbing down their words, talking about them with another adult instead of talking to them, etc.  "
442,"You're not even dating. He's not going to change the arrangement for his dog because a girl he likes and isn't even dating let alone in a serious committed relationship with, is uncomfortable. 
Look, I get it, I dated a guy who ""shared custody"" of his dog with his ex. I was not a fan. But if you ask him to choose between you and the happiness of his dog, he's going to choose his dog. It actually sounds like a nice arrangement she drops off the dog without meeting up with him; dog gets plenty of love/attention, etc. Much better than them meeting up to exchange the dog or take the dog for walks together or something! If you REALLY like the guy, date him and see where it goes. Once you're established in his life, he might be more willing to make other arrangements with her over the dog. But you can't start off expecting change. "
443,"So is it the fun weekend or the friend situation that you are jealous of? 

On a side note I noticed with friends lately getting married it's like a new thing of bachelor/bachelorette weekends being a multi-day and rent a house blow out. "
444,"OP if you're reading this comment, please read it over again 10x... You are over analyzing this and the top commenter is giving some perspective that I think could be of really great value to you."
445,"Sure. Instead of $45, you might get $50. Nice investment, huh?"
446,"So you don't want to bring your wife to the funeral of a man she never met but you're okay bringing a co-worker who also has never met this man? Gotcha.


You don't need to bring anyone else if you decide to not ask your wife. There will probably be old friends at the funeral and you all can catch up and remember the good times with your passed buddy.



Do not open the can of worms that is bringing another woman to an emotional event. Talk to your wife first."
447,"It is pretty terrible. The thing is, as my Mother is so strong willed, I need others to highlight how genuinely terrible this is! I feel like I'm blinded because she is my Mother and I feel bad for criticising her, but wow, sometimes I need to!"
448,"You're not going crazy, your Mum is the crazy one.


I'm all for you giving her a few weeks notice and bouncing. Tell her you will salvage the relationship but it's difficult to have your Mum as the landlord. Landlords are contractually obligated to fix the properties. If your partner had gotten more than a shock and ended up in the hospital, would your Mom have paid for the bills? "
449,"If she doesn't feel comfortable babysitting your child that's fine, but she needs to start contributing to your household in other ways in that case. It's unfair to you and your husband for her to freeload off you and take advantage of your generosity.
"
450,"Yeahhhhh. The initial disagreement: pay for college, not pay for college. I think there are merits to both sides. There isn't a *right* answer there, and it's something they both need to think and compromise on....

BUT this!! ""He thinks it's unfair and he should have this money"" What in the actual fuck? "
451,"I've been considering this since she was only 3yo when our dad and Emma's mom were in a custody war. Every so often our dad would refuse to drop off or allow Emma to be picked up by her mom, and the cops would be involved. She amazed me when, after an hour of my dad trying to charm the police and let Emma stay with him, she dropped her toys, picked up her backpack, walked up to the policeman and said, ""I'm ready now.""

I tell her all the time, once she turns 18 and wants to go to college, she is welcome to live with me. I'm very wary of fighting for legal guardianship because it would 1) invite my dad and all his drama into my family's life and I think it's unfair to them, 2) open emotional wounds, and 3) piss my dad off and cause him to go bat shit crazy on everyone else in the family even if they aren't involved.

I'm hoping that in 5 years she will either take my offer, or gain scholarship at a university far, far away from my dad's reach."
452,"It's like no one wants to answer you lol.

But honestly, do what's best for you mental health and the health of your baby. 

I'm not sure why your step sis got so pissed off because as a mom, she should understand where you were coming from. 

I think you should ignore that side and let her cool down. Then maybe have a talk with her about seeing the family when you can. It's very hard when even your own family members aren't supporting you in this situation. 

But really the choice is yours if you even want to mend this relationship or let it go. I know ""family is family"" but toxic people shouldn't stay in your life if they become such a problem for you."
453,"Honestly, I could forgive a guy who didn't tell me he was fired for a couple of days while he ran around desperately trying to find a job before admitting it.  

This?  Hell no!  Get out now before you end up working two jobs to support his lazy ass."
454,"I believe you misread. She was with him for 12 months before they got engaged, not 6. Though it doesn't change much, I know."
455,"OP, get your potential car checked by a mechanic before you purchase.  If you don't know much about cars, it's really easy to get swayed by something that looks good but is really a lemon.  Best of luck."
456,"Wow, you are a nutcase.  

1. Your behavior is super insecure and controlling. 

2. Your view of male friendships and homosexuality is immature and insulting.

3. You actually want your bf's friend to move away?  Now we are getting into the social isolation aspect of the emotionally abusive relationship you are in/working up to. 

4. Is he your boyfriend or your husband?  Make up your mind."
457,Someone's weird here but it definitely ain't her. 😊
458,"Why didn't you fight for more custody?

Do you know what his life was truly life at his dad's? Was he genuinely a full member of tje family, or did his dad emotionally abandon him for the step mother?  

I recently read someone write about how her father remarried and she always felt ""other"" to her half siblings. They'd go on vacations while she was at her mother's, not include her, etc. Now as an adult she was talking to a half sibling who made a comment about how she wasn't part of the family- offhand, this is just how things are. 

His dad presumably remarried by the time he was 7. If he then became a second class citizen to his half siblings, watching them grow up with two loving parents while both parents treated him coldly- that does a number on a kid. And it is NOT uncommon, it's very possible. You can provide for a kid financially and neglect them emotionally.

If that's what happened, you're dealing with a very hurt child. He wants you to make up for a decade of neglect"
459,[removed]
460,"You get flak for that at 20, the heck? Do you live in a really rural area? That seems crazy. How many people from your high school already have children?"
461,Yup. Lot of people won't date a single parent. Especially when they are younger and have lots of options. 
462,He literally thinks you're inferior to him as a woman and is offended that somehow your skills still translate to more money than his!
463,"&gt; they've stopped putting money in our college funds, and they've started taking money out of my brother's car savings. They told us that maybe we should consider a gap year. For what? So they can save money?

you do realize that most teenagers live without college and car funds, right? its their money. its their house. the bedrooms you live in aren't yours, they belong to your parents and they're letting you live in them. with some kids its the other way around. i remember when i was in high school i'd regularly chip in for bills and household expenses.

&gt;We'll just take what we want and all the money we can and just go. We refuse to sacrifice our future and well-being for three babies.

This is really disturbing. Why do you're entitled to take money from your parents and abandon them? 
Most disturbing of all to me is that you mention that your mom is at risk for a high risk pregnancy maybe once. The rest of this post is about how you and your brother won't getting as much money from your parents anymore. "
464,"Man are you selfish. You're an adult, act like one. If you don't like your living situation, move. If your brother wants a car he should get a job and buy one. Most people don't have parents who can buy them cars and put them through college. So congrats on joining the real world. These babies aren't taking your parents, but your shitty attitudes will push them away.

Also, I don't thing bashful means what you think it means."
465,"I agree. When you date someone with a child, you are dating the person and the child. 

That child is going to become your responsibility and OP made a good decision in knowing whether or not she was ready to become a surrogate mother. "
466,"I would contact him to see if he would like to keep them, seeing as this was his well-loved aunt. Since she's passed away, they may have sentimental value to him, and he may be grateful to have them."
467,"This is a tough situation. Grinding while dancing can still just be dancing these days. A little inappropriate but still not cheating. I've dating guys who've danced sexy with other girls and I was OK with it. I was there, it wasn't a secret and his intentions were clear (being that he was just dancing and having fun).  We had respect for each other and our relationship. 

But, there is definitely the grinding that involves a lot of contact and hey I'd like to fuck you later and my goal here is to give you a hard on.  And hey my guys not around so whatever.

Could go either way, but I will say, she really wanted you there so I am less inclined to think she was trying to be shitty with someone else while dancing. I wonder if when she saw you she might have liked to get all up on you!  

It's hard to say without knowing her or you. But the point is, you were uncomfortable so at the end of the day you have to decide if her intentions were ultimately innocent and forgivable. If you really like her, I'd say you move on and just ask she not dance with other dudes."
468,It's emotional manipulation. 
469,I'm going to be 37 this year and both my beagles sleep with me every night. OP's dad can do fuck himself. 
470,"Do that! Drive him there, as much as she decided by herself to get him, you can decide by yourself to give him to your friends. After that go buy a chihuahua! Then tell her, if she is upset, that its too late :) Balls you need balls in this situation, do the best for the puppy and your relationship!"
471,"It'll pass! It might take a while but it will. Get him a nightlight, make a show about checking for monsters in the closet. My mom mixed glitter and water into a spray bottle and called it ""fairy protection"" when i was young. He's so young, but this won't permanently scar him."
472,You got out of your car on a busy road to go chasing down pieces of lettuce and tomato to put back together?
473,"I'm sorry but why the heck should he call his parents every day? OP is 19 and in college, he needs to be laying out much stricter boundaries all around. He needs to distance himself from his sister, stop letting her hang around. If she asks, he should tell her that he doesn't appreciate being tattled on and she doesn't deserve his time anymore. He needs to stop answering the phone every time his parents call, that's ridiculous. Let them leave an angry voicemail and call back the next day. If they scold him, he can hang up. He's an adult. 

Edit: Most parents are neither petty nor callous enough to cut their child off just for asserting himself. It's normal to expect a 19-year-old to push back when his parents are overbearing. If his parents *are* actually that petty, then yes, of course he should play by their rules. Avoid the sister, tell the parents whatever he needs to say to keep them happy, then limit contact with the lot of them after college, in my opinion. "
474,"What?? What reaction? The stuff he said to you was beyond unacceptable to say to anyone, much less your own child. Inexcusable! He asked a question and instead of getting self-criticism from you he got an actual answer that obviously hit the nail a little too on the head. You blocked him, good for you. Like you would anyone who sent you abusive texts. 

Then when he realized he'd lost control he turned to  manipulation and guilt (""it's your fault I called you a cow, you *made* me!"" ""I guess you just hate me and wish I was dead like everyone else does, poor me!""). If you stick with it you might even get a fake apology (""I'm sorry *you feel that way* and *took it the wrong way.*"") When/if that doesn't work he'll smear you to everyone you know, you're a terrible daughter (people know the truth, but it still hurts.) If you talk to him again, expect him to act like it never happened in the first place, and if it ever comes up again in conversation he'll assert with complete confidence that you were the one who started it / it was all your fault /you're ""too sensitive."" I've seen this play out a lot. 

Going no contact is hard, but when you do you will find it is a great relief and your mental health will be better than ever."
475,"How much time is your wife getting with you, then? It sounds like there's 2-3 days a week it's you and her and the youngest for the 6-8 hours the kids are in school and a few evenings after the kids are in bed. That should be enough for you to get some down time and still spend quality time with her, especially if you're able to get a sitter for date night at least once a week (good idea in general)

I'm not hugely familiar with firefighters, in a regular job 75+ hours a week basically means never seeing your family, so I thought that was the case. But 75+ hours in 24 hour shifts isn't nearly so bad.

It can be very lonely to go whole days at a time without seeing your partner, though. That I would struggle with. 
Is there any way you can connect with her while you're at work? Order flowers to the house, leave notes for her to find during the day, etc might help.

A few people who've been there have suggested couples counselling. It could help you two figure out what you both really need here. "
476,"Ok, but how fluent does he need to be to get a cashier gig?"
477,I'm confused. It sounds an awful lot like you're trying to imply that if a woman was in OPs boyfriend's position the advice would be different. Are you saying if a man were physically touching a woman's body the advice wouldn't be for her to tell him to stop and physically move his hands away if he continued? u/wanderingdev is saying that OPs boyfriend should not have to put up with another person inappropriately touching him without his consent. That is pretty standard advice given to women on this sub all the time.  
478,"My wife and I alternate making plans each week. Usually I like to find a new restaurant on Yelp (any food, any price range) and find an activity to do before or after dinner. This could be a free museum, drinks at a new place, mini golf, literally whatever. The key is new experiences, which makes it feel more like a date than eating at your favorite restaurant.

Next week it's her turn to plan something for you, that way you aren't stressed each week trying to plan something, and instead get to be excited about her planning a date.

It's easy, often times cheap, fun, and it will make a big improvement in the relationship. You don't have to do each week, but make it a routine so both of you expect it and are prepared for it."
479,"You need to be honest with him. ""Dad, I'm happy you're happy, but I cannot reconcile your relationship with a girl who's barely older than your daughter, especially when you yourself told me that the only reason men date much younger women is to control them and because they can't get women their own age. I wish you every happiness, but I don't feel comfortable seeing you right now.""

It will not be a fun conversation. Your dad might be upset or even angry. But he can't force you to be okay with this, and there is no reason why you need to force yourself to be okay with this. He is a grown adult and he can do whatever (and frankly, whoever) he wants, but he can't expect his actions to be consequence-free. 

My dad has picked a horrible woman to be his wife. In our last phone conversation, I told him that it's his relationship and he can do what he wants, but I want nothing to do with her. If he and I can have a relationship that doesn't involve her at all (no seeing her, limited conversation about her), then I think we'll do that. If he tries to force me to accept/forgive/welcome her (which he's already starting to do), then I think I'll have to cut contact with him as well. 

It's up to you whether you want a relationship with your dad where you do not discuss his love-life at all, or whether you don't feel comfortable having a relationship with him at all. But he can't force you to be okay with his relationship just because that's what *he* wants.



"
480,"&gt; Verbal abuse does not mean it's okay to physically harm someone.
&gt; In every situation, *excluding when he corners you,* you have the ability to walk away

Did you miss the part where the only time she lashes out physically *is when he corners her?* 

I get that you don't think you are, but you are really victim-blaming here. "
481,"He's a 20 year old adult.  He is fully aware a diet of Cheezits isn't good for him, and he does not care.  You mentioning it isn't going to accomplish anything. This is like telling smokers ""Don't you know those are bad for you?!"""
482,"Or they all made the choice to not tell her the plans changed. If her own mother didn't tell her, they may have all been concerned about her reaction, and waited to fill her in. If she has severe control issues with her brother and is prone to overreactions (like basically accusing her fiance of taking him on a trip to hurt him), waiting til they could address her together as group makes absolute logic sense to me. 

Edit: 

&gt;She advised them to tell me last

Her mother did indeed tell them to wait to tell her. So, yes, OP has severe issues surrounding her brother that need to be addressed. 
"
483,I'm sorry but this made me laugh out loud. Loudly. Whilst in a silent office full of coworkers!
484,I agree with the people who are saying the real issue isn't that he forgot (I understand why it is so important to you and I too find it annoying that he forgot) but the way that he reacted when he brought it up. He really should have been more apologetic. Take some time to think about what is really keeping you in this relationship because that reaction will certainly rear it's head next time he does something that upsets you.
485,"He didn't tell you because he's been dumped for having kids before. He should've been really honest about that.  It's a lot more deceptive then lying about weight or height.  That's up there with the, ""Oh, I've been tested and I'm STD free"" and then later, ""Oh, I guess my test must've been out of date. Sorry!"""
486,"I think she probably is just used to wearing it and likes it as a piece of jewelry. I wouldn't oveethink it. Ultimately, she broke up with you, so I don't​ see that it matters."
487,No one fucks a girl then gets upset because she blocks him not to mention he considers her a little sister? Creepy or lying and I think it's the latter. Also it was incredibly immature of him to bring up her breasts. I think he did it to spite you. He's obviously still so hung up about the ex. I'd cut your losses now. Good luck to you girly! You can do better. 
488,"And block her, OP.  You don't need the anxiety of wondering when she'll contact you next and rip the stiches on your heart."

490,"No ""please"" or ""appreciate"". Be direct. 

Don't put yourself in the position of supplicant asking a favor of her, asking her not to send unattractive photos of you to your BF. She will delight in sending them. 

You need to be strategic.

1) Have BF block her asap on Snapchat and any/all other social media. This is crucial.

2) Do this next step by text or email. (I don't think you can handle an in-person confrontation.) Make it short and sweet. Let her know you know what she's been up to, you don't appreciate it and it's not working. You want to talk to her like a peer with whom you're disgusted. Call her on her BS, then ice her out.

493,"&gt; Boyfriend likes the silent treatment. How do I get him to stop?!


It's a very immature, childish thing to do, and your boyfriend is closer to 30 than 20.... don't expect him to ever change that.


You've been long distance your whole relationship? Be careful... you're about to uproot your life and risk following this guy you've never been around for extended periods of time, and at best he's still very immature and rude in some aspects..... in a LDR, communication is all you have, so for him to shut it down for a whole week at a time... multiple times.... that takes disrespect and immaturity, plain and simple.


Ask yourself how well you really know him, and make sure you have a backup plan for when you move and it eventually breaks down."

495,"Is she using ""I give you sex"" as a bargaining chip? It's something both party should enjoy and not a tool for passive aggressive berating.

500,"Some potential things you can try:

- The honest approach. Tell her her insistence on this subject affects your self esteem more than any amount of acne does. That her behavior suggests that she wants you to be ""fixed,"" versus just being happy that she has a smart, capable daughter. Ask her to please keep your skin out of further conversations.

- Indirect (recommended if she's not reasonable, but still supports you financially): ""return to sender"" this and all future packages. Act as frustrated as she is as to why the darn post office isn't delivering your mail and you have no idea why.

- Direct (recommended if you don't rely on her): return the package and tell her you did it. Tell her to get her money back and expect the same response with all future products. Don't engage in any conversation about it past that.   "
501,"Oh, i agree that it's self defense, self care, and 100% justified. 

That isn't what I'm commenting on. Sometimes, children of monsters are terrified to use skills of the monster against them because they're afraid it will imply that they (the child) are just like the monster. 

So, if this method will only serve to hurt him more, mentally... then it's safe to say it isn't recommended. 

He needs to get out of there, he needs to cut contact, he needs to begin the healing process. 

If he's strong enough to use her tactics to do so - without fracturing his own mental state, then YES! he should do this. 

Otherwise, he's going to have to find another way. "

504,"Oh, I absolutely agree.

He is absolutely entitled to having different values about sex and intimacy. That's perfectly fine. 

If he doesn't like her past or values then he can either NOT date her or not shame her about it. He's being completely unfair in shaming and judging her. Nobody is FORCING him to ask her about her past and nobody is forcing him to date her if he doesn't like it. "

507,"Whether it's intentional or not doesn't change the result: You are being manipulated and bullied. The fact he doesn't know he does it doesn't really change the situation for you. You still need to get yourself away from this. 

I understand the desire to help him, but I'd strongly advise you to resist it and just break up because you're not happy. Whether he knows or not, he wont react well to being told his behavior is a problem. You don't get a win here. You don't get to save him from his own choices. You have to just get out."
508,"This school thing was the only time I actually heard the reason as to why he was yelling, the other times it's just been screaming and swearing, something like ""FUCKING HELL, YOU STUPID LITTLE SHIT"" doesn't really give much context to the situation.

I know my limits and i would have declined to be a bride's mais from the get go. Sure, it sounds fun but i am supposed to be supporting and doing things for the bride. If my anxiety  keeps me from doing whatever else the bridesmaids are doing; I would not complain or say yes to being one.

Also your friend got pissed after your second approach. She sucks but damn you were wrong in the first place."
514,"Cats are hella weird, and that's coming from someone who has three of them. One of them in particular loooves everyone, he is the most overly social cat I have ever met. It's insane. 9 times out of 10 though, he'll bug my SO for pets even though I am the one who shows interest in him. My SO doesn't really care for cats, he doesn't mind them but never pays them any attention and shooes them away if they try to cuddle. This intrigues social kitty and as soon as my SO falls asleep at night you can bet that cat curls up on top of him and purrs like there's no tomorrow.

Maybe don't advice your roommate to ignore kitty, but just giving the cat space does a ton for their comfort levels. The more you ignore it, the more at ease they'll feel because you're not trying to invade their space and stressing them out. One of my cats I didn't even see for three months after I adopted him and overly social cat because he was so scared of everything. I never pushed him and left him to hide under the sofa all day if that's what he wanted. Slowly he started coming out during the day time when he realised I didn't show him much interest and shortly after that he started to come to me for pets now and again. Now, 7 years later, he's a total mommas boy and is up in my face 24/7 but still doesn't really like anyone else. I lived alone with them though so that didn't really give him much option in who to bond with when he felt ready.

As the other posters suggested, stop letting the cat jump on your lap, stop petting it and feeding it. When it realises it has to go to roommate for its wants and needs it should get easier for all of you. :) I understand your roommate and how stressful it is to not bond with a pet you really wanted, but with time and patience even the most stubborn ones tend to come around!"

The gifts don't make you happy, and you would prefer he show his love in other ways like (fill in the blank, and be prepared to give specific examples).

This is one of those situations where I feel like the 5 Love Languages should be required reading. He is trying to show affection by sending you gifts, but you probably feel loved by physical affection or time spent together."

525,"Putting your issues aside, he really sucks at being a Dad. Basically at this point, he appears to be a live-in sperm and money donor. You didn't mention once how he spends time with your child, or that he even really cares for her presence. She is obviously a burden since he can't even take her to run errands. How disgusting. 

As for you, you aren't a slave to him because he works. That is ridiculous. You're living your life basically taking care of everything and he thinks he is off the hook because he works full time? I would be livid if my partner took vacations multiple times and excluded the family. How is he even ok with being gone doing hobbies so much? Doesn't he value you or your child? 

I'm sorry, even if he isn't a ""bad guy"" he is a horrible partner and a horrible father. Sounds like it's time to have a come to Jesus."

As useless as your complaint is frivolous."
527,"I had a LEEP done a few years ago, and literally had it done on my lunch break. Went back to work afterwards and everything. You'll have a little soreness afterwards but you really don't need two people driving hours to come take care of you. If you have a cavity filled, would they come take care of you after that too? Because that's what I'd compare it to. 

It's pretty scary going into it, but trust me when I say it's easy as pie. The worst part was when they do the numbing agent injection because it has some adrenaline added to it, so it made my body freak out for a minute but after that I was good. I asked them not to show me the needles or the wire loop for the procedure. It only takes like 15 minutes and you'll just need to take it easy afterwards. If you're going home after, you can just lay on the couch and watch Netflix or something. You don't need a bunch of people to take care of you, you'll be fine I promise. "
528,"&gt; I suggest a job for you, work opposite shifts if need be to save on child care, I think once you're on equal footing with contributions you'll see some positive changes.

So in addition to taking care of 100% of the housework and child care, she should just get a job with all her free time, and *then* maybe he'll pitch in? She's already working, and he's doing jack shit to help. And he lies to her. There's a fundamental lack of respect going on here. Why would that suddenly change if the OP takes on even more responsibility?

OP's husband isn't complaining about the situation. Blaming her and assuming he wants things to change is a big leap on your part."
529,Yeah that's kind of a big deal. I would feel bad for Cindy too if I didn't know better.
530,"&gt; I don't have guy friends either so I think it's reasonable for me to not want him to have female friends

I assure you, it's not reasonable. Not allowing your SO to have friends JUST because they're the opposite sex is controlling. I can understand not wanting them to associate with specific people who are of the opposite sex, but writing off the entire other gender is unreasonable and a generally seen as controlling. "
531,"Because if he is as abusive as the letter makes him out to be, it would be putting OP and the ex in huge danger. "
532,"I mean, when it's ""My boyfriend [39M] won't let me go to my [21F] grandma's funeral because he thinks my family's a bad influence and withdrew all the cash from our shared banking account and he hid my SS card so I can't take out a credit card"", yah, the sub's pretty hard on the guy.

I haven't really seen much hate on the guys other than ""well she's a 19yo girl and immature, what did you expect?"""
533,"You don't know that she's no good. You are not giving her a chance and really... It's your brothers life. 

You feel abandoned by your brother. That's what you need to focus on and focus on dealing with. The question becomes... Why are you so angry that he is happy? Why are you putting energy into being angry instead of trying to make yourself happy as well. "
534,"Out of curiosity, how often do you have ""really big fights""?  You've only been dating a year.  For most people in relationships they actually enjoy (especially the early stages) there aren't a whole ton of reasons to have multiple huge blow-up fights.  But for you it's so common, just in the first year, that you seem to be treating it like a given.  That is, your post isn't ""My BF and I keep having really big fights,"" it's ""this is a thing my BF does when we have really big fights.""

While everyone's different, I just wanted to mention that it sounds like you've had (at minimum) three more really big fights with your BF in the last year than I've had with my wife in the 4.5 years I've known her.

So, in addition to the fact that ""shut the fuck up"" is an incredibly awful thing to say to someone you allegedly care about, have you given any thought to why you guys have ""really big fights"" so frequently?  

I dunno, I'd say cut bait.  A year is a fair bit of time to spend in a relationship, but if it's a year of big fights and being told to shut the fuck up I personally would skip the normal recommendation to try to work on it first.  Doesn't really sound like you guys work very well together at the very least, and on top of that he's an asshole.  My vote is to cut your losses."
535,"I was going to say it's time to have the ""how do you see your life"" talk but I see you had it - and she sees her life as a stay at home mother. Now it's up to you to decide how you see your life, long-term. Do you want to have a house you don't have to worry about, your kids in trusted hands all the time, someone whose whole job is to ensure your household is running smoothly? Or would you rather have the financial security of a second income, the stability of having a solid nest egg, and a wife with career ambitions outside of family life? How willing are you to compromise - would you be okay with her staying home for a more extended period of time and then easing back into the workforce, would you be okay if she worked on selling things from home like on Etsy?

The next step is to figure out what you want, present it to her, and find the compromise in between. Maybe when you list out what you want, she might realize she also wants a house soon. Or she won't and you two find a common time line you can live with.

And if you can't...you might not be compatible."
536,"I agree with your friends. Do t bring it up yourself and refuse to elaborate if they do.

I'm surprised actually, it's always rude to discuss one's income but you all seem to know a surprising amount about each others financial status and budgets. The only person I discuss that with is the one person who's taxes i do!"
537,"Do you live with him? Are you afraid that if you break up, he won't leave you alone?

However difficult it is, it's better than being murdered. Less than a month ago, you ""resolved"" his jealousy issues. Now, he's experimenting with a new way to control you-- fear. Don't let him. Don't let him pretend that his words only have meaning when he tells you they do. He *said* he would kill you. He used those words, because that's what he felt. Take him at his word."
538,"Despite some other posts, I think you're a great friend of his. There's nothing wrong with you telling him your opinions.

Now, the situation you presented is almost exactly like how my situation went. My ex and I were together for two years and I knew very early on that she was too dependent on other people for love and affection. When we started dating eventually she became VERY dependent on me for her happiness. If I didn't keep in constant contact with her she would get upset at me. If I didn't send her sweet little ""I love you"" poems when we're not together she would get upset.

I was very busy as well and dedicated almost all my free time to her, outside of studying. She didn't like it if I spent time meeting new people, had study groups or did something without her. You can see in her face her frustration.

After about 5 months I tried to tell her about these issues and she said she'll work on them but never followed through. I tried playing those games like your friend, but it ultimately backfired on me. I gave her so many chances to change that my friends started to notice how weak I was becoming. She was draining the life out of me, and I started to think the toxic relationship was okay. My friends all said I should have broken up with her months ago but I didn't; it was too late and I have felt and invested too much with the girl.

When the day came and it ended between us, it hurt like hell that I invested so much, too much, into a relationship for it to just end.

Sometimes, it's better if people in relationships like this learn the hard way. If it fails, then he'll learn a lot about himself and what he expects and wants out of a relationship. It'll hurt a lot but you sound like a great friend and I'm sure you'll help him through it.

By the way, I was my ex's first boyfriend so the dependability was understandable but too extreme."

561,"&gt; This is something he should have figured out how to deal with a long time ago.

I'm sure she has legitimate fears but her not wanting to work on them is ridiculous. She's giving lip service saying she'll do this or that or go to a therapist but she hasn't yet. 

I would start with marriage counseling and then if that doesn't work start the paperwork for divorce. That's no way to live. She may be a wonderful person but she'll never have any kind of relationship with a man if she can't get help for her mental issues about sex. "
566,"Stop involving parents in this process.  It sounds like you've gotten some good ideas from yours, but hers are racist and shitty, and ultimately, none of your parents need to approve of the house you buy.  You're adults and are buying it with your own money.   Stop talking about the house with her parents at all.  If they ask how the house hunt is going, just say, ""Good"" and change the subject.  Don't go to that viewing.  I agree with the other commenter that this will probably be hard and uncomfortable and your in-laws won't take it well, but it's something you need to do.  Boundary-pushers won't stop with one thing; you guys will be dealing with this your whole marriage if you don't nip it in the bud.

The main issue here, though, is you don't really have a parents-in-law problem as much as you have a fiancée problem.  You and your fiancée need to be on the same page here - she needs to stop valuing her parents' (shitty, racist) opinions over yours.  Have you asked her why she's suddenly changed her mind and why she thinks y'all need to spend so much more?  What exactly does she want now?"

There are people dying in the ER, if you're lucky enough not to be you're not a priority yet and you need to wait all day if you have to

Additionally, when accompanying me or one of my siblings to the doctor/ER my mom never announces she's a nurse everrrr, she'll ask necessary medical questions or look st our test results then explain in private what they mean and what's going on to us. She's made it seem like a big faux pas to throw around the word nurse when other people are doing their job to care for your loved one.... so it prob is a faux pas and you should prob avoiding doing this Esp since you're not even actually one yet. "
573,"Well, looks like I'm never suggesting a threesome to my girlfriend! If you love your boyfriend, make the tough choice to cut mark out by ending the threesomes. Tell your boyfriend you just aren't feeling it anymore. "
574," It doesn't matter.  All a girl sees when you go in hard and *don't* call,  is that you're full of shit. 

Your dating technique is pretty douchey. You want them to be your ""muse""? Gag. "
575,"What do you feel hurts you the most ? If we ""figure that out"" than maybe we can go further but lets start with that. "
576,"&gt; The three of us went out for my wife's birthday earlier this month

Don't do this? Why would you invite her to hang out lol

&gt; My sister in law is also the kind to treat her child like an object. She has threatened to not let us (and others) see him in the past if she doesn't like what we do.

Not your problem. 

&gt; She is sick of every family interaction turning into a lecture from her sister.

Ignore her. Only meet your family when she is not there. It might take some extra planning but it's obviously stressing you guys out to see her. Just don't. "
577,"You should respect his wish, and be patient. But also talk to him and tell him how you feel. Tell him you dont' want to ruin his career, but it's difficult for you to keep a relationship secret.

Also, try to figure out if the two of you are just having fun, or it's actually leading to something more serious.

In the end - no matter what happens, you'll have a hell of a story for your friends!"
578,"Good.  Get away, stay away, and put him far behind you."
579,"Maybe you could explain it to him this way: right now he is acting as if it's not a big deal and he wants you both to forget about it. Unfortunately, it was frightening for you. If he keeps telling you that it just happened and wasn't a big deal, you don't know why it happened or what he's doing to prevent it from happening again. Therefore, you will continue to be afraid of it happening again and of him hurting you that time. ""I just won't do it again,"" isn't really a very effective strategy for prevention. To truly feel that it won't happen again, you need him to describe what was the thought process and emotions that led him to do this and what, specifically, he will do to prevent it. If the two of you have been arguing a lot, prevention could involve talking out and taking steps to resolve the underlying issues, whatever they are. Picking on you about one glass of wine really feels like he was mad about something else and misdirected his anger at the wine - so he needs to come out and verbalize the real issue, whatever it is. "
580,"I assume that. In particular I'm from a largely impoverished region, also largely impacted by fundamentalist religion, so I have a lot of experience with people who don't consider it because kids just happen. Child free isn't for everyone, but once you're casually working 75+ hour weeks I assume you've taken on too much financial burden.

I don't mean to sound snooty, I think anyone that wants kids and plans to parent them well should have them. I just don't think very many people can actually afford the kids they want, in the late stage capitalism world we're living in."
581,"You remind me of a friend of mine. She is a lovely women who is married to a man I find to be creepy in many ways, including having emotions that can turn on and off like a tap and that he has made inappropriate comments to me. 

Anyway I was once talking about this online and wondering why such a lovely women could have ended up with such a horrible man. Someone very wisely pointed out to me that it is nearly always very nice people who get taken in by men like him, because less pleasant more selfish people wouldn't tolerate his terrible behaviour. They have boundaries and don't let others impose upon them. 

You've sort of admitted to something similar in your recent reply to u/memecitydreams . You shouldn't let yourself be taken advantage of. "
582,"He has no place to get annoyed when he's not paying rent. Groceries usually don't come anywhere close! I'd tell him that he's welcome to buy his own furniture when he has his own place to put it in, and tell him to start saving his money towards rent rather than new furniture. 

I would allow him to keep what he has already, though."
583,"When looking through rose colored glasses,  it just looks like a sea of flags "
584,"It sounds like there's no saving the relationship. If that's the case, then the sooner you break up and disentangle your lives the better. You two aren't going to get married, and you're both unhappy with how things are. It would be better for both of you to break up and move on.

You might consider starting to go to therapy for yourself, if you aren't already. A breakup like this will be emotionally difficult, so it will help to have someone to talk to about it.

I assume you still fully own the house, and she isn't on the title or anything like that. When you tell her to move out (which should be ASAP), check the landlord-tenant laws where you live to see how much notice you need to give her. Do this in writing in case she tries to stay past the eviction date."
585,"Wow, wtf? Your husband sounds like a child. It sounds like your relationship has deteriorated and the only thing you have in common is your child. You two sound like you would be better off apart than together. He can still bond with his child if you divorce him."
586,"You should totally start hiking the AT from the other direction and meet her halfway!!  Would be a huge gesture and you can also clear your own head on the way.  Maybe YOU will come to some conclusions that you don't know if she's the one to marry.  

Crazy ideas aside, I know it's not plausible to drop everything and do this, it takes months of planning and possibly some training.  plus with a job, rent, etc etc it's not feasible for a hundred reasons.  I would say wait it out and see what she says.  If you're willing to commit and love her for who she is, depression and all, this could just be something she really needs right now"
587,This is turning into a really bad sitcom.
588,He started on Fri to try and pick a fight. He was ramping himself up all weekend. This is most definitely abuser patterns. Just looking for a fight and doesn't need much of an excuse.  
589,"I got up at night to wander the house and eat spoonfuls of sugar and steal small objects and other weird shit.

They tried locking my door, tying rope to the knob, all kinds of very-not-fire-code-compliant ways to keep me from getting out. I could not tell you why I was so fixated on this behavior, especially since my father - a former drill sergeant - terrified me by the light of day.

Children are clever, unpredictable little idiots. There's really no telling what they'll get up to, no matter how obedient they usually are. But you're a parent - I'm sure you know that! Kids can be just utterly befuddling in their reasoning and behavior."
590,"I think you're in the right. He couldn't have waited 30mins or an hour? Telling kids to wait until he gets home is pretty unfair for the kids who would be scratching to get the presents

&gt; I said if we are going to not bother with today then we may as well not do Christmas anymore.

^ that's a bit over the top, two completely different holidays and occasions"
591,"Don't even bother telling her you don't want her to go, just block her on all forms of social media and move on. 

She didn't invite you to this thing, clearly doesn't want you do to go, and is grabbing one hotel room with a guy she wants to ""kiss"". Even if she didn't plan on acting on that, this is some kind of bullshit test to see how you react.

 Let her know she's made a huge mistake by never speaking to her again."
592,"Agreed. My brother in laws kids are in their late teens now, and if anything they are more violent and destructive now than they were when they were little brats. I won't be surprised when one of them goes to jail."
593,"Would he consider going to therapy with you, to navigate these waters? Though, honestly, I'm not sure this can be fixed. He may be open to adopting a toddler/older child, but I'm thinking that while OP loves her daughter, she is basically counting down ""11 more years until she is off to college and I get my life back! I can do 11 years!"" and adding another child will add to that counter and would probably result in depression or resentment.

Conversely, if husband stays, after OP agreed to 2 kids and then changed her mind (absolutely not saying to have another child if you don't want one!) husband may...will probably...feel anger and resentment.

Personally, my Sig Other led me on about marriage and children for years. (He didn't want either, but knew I would leave if he told me that, so kept stringing me along with excuses). I'm 45 years old now, in a relationship for 20 years. Never got to get married or have kids. The anger and resentment destroyed our relationship. We are in the process of splitting, largely because I still want to have/adopt/foster children, and he wants no part of it. 

If OP and her husband split, it may ultimately be healthier for both of them, unless husband can truly give up his life goal and accept only having one child, letting go of the resentment. I couldn't, despite multiple therapists. Maybe he can. 

I'm sorry you both are in this position. Best wishes, and good luck."
594,"How do you give someone respect for doing a job they're supposed to do? It probably very difficult to be on his own raising a kid on the weekends yes, but the respect he deserves isn't regarding the expected job of being a parent. What else is he going to do in this situation -also go out and party while his wife if gone? Of course not. "
595,"That's everything and more I had to say.

Also you wouldn't act wrong if you told him out on how he fails in nurturing his children. They probably won't be the most sympathetic people in later lives as well.

Edit: 'later lives' sounds awkwardly Buddhistic right now. Guess you get what I mean anyway."
596,"It's foolish to move closer and most likely uproot your life to some degree for someone who doesn't respect you. Plenty of people out there who don't cheat in LDRs, they're the ones you can move for."
597,"&gt; OP, as for your place of employment, I must say they do not seem to be trying very hard (or at all) to get you good experience or listen to your concerns. Consider searching elsewhere for a company that will see and utilize your value. I will say, that's only furthered by the fact that their idea was to send you to a Middle Eastern country. First thing I thought was ""I bet she doesn't get to go."" The Middle East is not exactly accepting of women holding important roles.... I wouldn't be surprised if your management knew the whole time.
&gt; 

You're spot on.
I've told my manager time and time again that technical experience is far more valuable to me than salary at this point in my career.  But they really don't seem to get that...

And yeah I was a little surprised when they suggested middle east, I wouldn't be surprised if that was why..."
598,"Yeah it's always weird how different people react to things differently.

Nobody is the gold standard for how to respond to this situation. If OP doesn't want to be with someone that responds this way, then she's free to leave. Doesn't make bf wrong, doesn't make OP oversensitive. Just means OP has a picture in her head of what she wants and is willing to look for it.

OP have you discussed your concerns with bf?"
599,"Oh forgot to sign it.

Love,

Your friendly neighborhood nosleep writer"
600,"Our business is ONLY open on Weekends.

Sure and $10,000 isn't that much to go to Hawaii. But I don't get to go to Hawaii, I'm being asked to take a vacation to Chicago in winter."
601,The business only being open on the weekends is reason enough to say no. You literally can't get away from work. 
602,"I'm 30F and dating a 22 year old man. Same situation as you. Got out of a five year relationship, both of us are not looking for marriage or children and we get along great. When my friends give me crap, I remind them that plenty of our 30-something male friends are dating girls the same age as my SO without getting flack so why can't I? "
603,"Tread lightly OP, people don't generally cut their parents and extended family out of their lives without good cause. 

&gt;I was also able to fact check the ""horrible things"" my mom had said about them long ago, and found them all to be lies.

Fact check how exactly? Did you ask them and they said ""nah man we never abused her""? How do you know they're not the ones who are lying to you?

&gt;In fact, my dad before meeting my mom had a really fun and close relationship with his family and such.

Did your father say that? Or did your newfound relatives tell you that? 

&gt;Is it appropriate to try and talk to my dad about it?

Yes I'd say you are old enough to know the truth by now. Talk to your father. Ask him what happened. Tell him that you've been in contact with these people and you'd like to hear his side of things. 

&gt;I'd love for my dad to be able to be part of his family again.

Uhhh....does your dad even want to be a part of his family again?"
604,Hey what did I ever do to you :c 
605,"Honestly I think a lot of the initial differences come from hormones, and carrying/caring for this baby inside your body for 9 months. Dad doesn't have to eat differently, drink differently, have crying fits when an ASPCA commercial that used to bug you comes on tv. He can feel, say, the baby kick...but mom has that baby moving around all the time. And if you're breastfeeding that hormonal bonding kicks in too. 

I'm a woman who never babysat...always felt awkward around kids. If someone handed me a baby I didn't know what to do. But after having my own I just went for it without hesitation. In any situation where there are two people where one hesitates more than the other, even if it's just a couple seconds, the one not hesitating is just going to go for it first. And then, know how to do this things first. It's easy to see how an unintended pattern can emerge in just the first few days that doesn't have anything to do with not trusting your partner to do it. "
606,"I'm not saying you said it, but do you think wishing your partner were more physically active to take care of their health and have a better physique is a bad thing per se?

"
607,"Honestly?  I think you're better off not online dating (or hire a profile consultant if you want to stick with it).  Ask your friends to set you up.  Try meeting people in singles groups or hobby groups.  You'll probably sit in the background the first few times, but eventually you'll open up and expand your social network and maybe meet someone.   


There's a book called Marry Him: The Case for Settling for Mr. Good Enough.  The general premise is that you should identify a handful of traits (five or less) that you absolutely should not compromise on.  If you compromise too much, you're not going to end up with a a happy relationship, and the relationship may fail down the road.  The traits need to be picked carefully (e.g. career-driven vs. goal-driven, higher-educated vs. well-read).  


Maybe consider some therapy (do your research on what kind) if you think you need help on the social anxiety front.  It may be a good idea anyway, to work through self-esteem and dating issues--I'm worried you may be willing to settle for a bad relationship. "
608,Blocking a person from leaving/manhandling them like he did to you are big red flags too. As well as the crazy shit about making you cook with no heads up and ignoring all your offered alternatives even down to making it himself. I'm glad you're set on getting away from him. Don't let your family talk you out of it.
609,"Does it matter if it's abusive or not? It is completely disrespectful. There are rules to arguing, and if he's going to call you names/tell you to shut up/swear, then he's breaking those rules."
610,"That doesn't really matter now because you are blaming failing school your previous year apart because you were ""depressed."" Like, does that kind of thing seem normal to you? This kind of dependence? It's unhealthy.

I know you love this girl, sure, but wake up you gotta make money, you know what I mean? How are you going to be the husband, the partner, the parent (maybe) one day that she deserves if you can't get your shit together to finish your degree?"
611,"Pretty sure ""Meeting for kisses"" is a reference to the huge viral reddit threads where a guy live updates/tracks down his cheating wife ""Jenny"" and she trickle-truthed him with the phrase ""just meeting for kisses"""
612,"Yeah, my wife and I are going to have to have a conversation about the boundaries we want to set. She's never babysitting, that's for sure. "
613,"""Hey neighbor! I see you have a pretty new baby and I know that can be tiring.  If you need a babysitter or a friendly ear, I'm right next door."""
614,"If OP is doing any research st all on it, which he just said he is, then that's about the first thing listed. All articles on it state the massive life risk in order to make sure any woman reading who might be experienceing an ectopic pregnancy gets medical attention immediately. So perhaps OP is just a little caught up in his own motives, but it seems unlikely that he's totally unaware that there is a health risk to his ex. "
615,"Just to clarify, hypochondriasis is *anxiety* over having a serious illness, not necessarily insisting you do have one (though it can be), and likely as not crops up on its own. It's a bit different than insisting a paper cut is a terrible wound. It also tends to present as focusing on a specific symptom, e.g. get the shits frequently from anxiety and constantly obsess that it might be Crohn's disease or whatever. This might just be the learned-helplessness codependence between overly-attached mommy and son.

Dude needs a therapist more than anything else, tbh.

Source: am an actual hypochrondriac "
616,"&gt;Separately, how do these conversations come up? I've never discussed reduced rent, textbook costs, etc.... If you give more details, we can help you figure out more of what's going on

These really feel like unusual conversations, and OP's the common thread.  People don't really talk like that in my experience.  It's also strange how OP seems to be cataloging everybody else's expenses.  Like, why does he care how much people spend on lunch?  Either he knows a lot of shitty people, or he's projecting some serious income based insecurity.

I don't even really know how much most of my long-term friends make.  It's kind of a third rail conversation for most people,  you just don't mention your income because it can cause issues.  
"
617,"I don't even know that you necessarily owe him an apology. I would probably say ""I'm pretty upset about what happened the other day. I told you not to mess with me and you did anyway. The only way I could get you to listen to me was an elbow to the side, I'm not ok with that being my last resort to get you to stop doing things to me that I don't like. How do we fix this?"""
618,That's unusual after two years. 
619,"Well it was tongue in cheek but honestly, don't marry this girl because you've been with her for 4 years or because some stranger on the internet told you to. 

If you're honestly having this much difficulty popping the question because of your unwavering filial duties, just let her go. As much as you're hurting from this dose of reality, think of how much it hurts your girlfriend every time you defer to your father's wishes or his POV even if it's not reasonable or rational at all. "
620,"See, this isn't the first time something like this has happened. First time I ever met cousin, two summers ago, he pushed daughter off of a slide tower... Thing.

No one warned me that he was on the spectrum, or that he had violent tendencies, and he was just up there so I assumed it'd be okay to let her climb on up while I ran to the front to catch her off the slide.

I have to be a hovercopter mom when his family is around because they just let him do what he wants, which isn't safe."
621,"First of all, it sounds really stressful to have a partner who is that negative about what (for the vast majority of people) is a routine part of life.

I see a few possibilities.  Do you think she could be depressed?  

What is her family of origin like?  Do you think she might have an unconscious expectation to be a housewife, work part time, something like that?

Unlikely, but is it possible she has had really negative experiences at work?  When I was first starting out, I had a string of awful jobs because I felt like if I was hired, I had to take it.  I paid no attention to the work culture or anything but the promise of a paycheck.

Have you talked to her about it?  Maybe be a little more diplomatic, but you are right: Nearly everyone works, and the vast majority of jobs have unpleasant aspects.  Do you think her expectations are off?"
622,"In my humble opinion you should:

1- Stop dating Mr Dummy

2- Go on the vacation

3- Invite your mother/father/both/a friend to the vacation




"
623,Depends on the dog. Crate training is advised by vets to help with separation anxiety. I've known dogs that destroy stuff or hurt themselves if left out without an owner present. 
624,"Some dogs get into stuff even if they're potty trained. 

We've got a short fatty puggle and still have 3 baby gates and various doors closed when we're not home. And really, even if we are home. 

Otherwise he gets into anything that is slightly edible. 

We'd probably crate him if he  didn't freak out.

That said 7am-11pm is a ridiculously long time. "
625,[removed]
626,You can set up your existing profile so that anyone whose​ profile doesn't identify them as female can't message you.
627,"Yeah, this thread is just silly. OP's anger and exasperation at his partner's awful behavior is apparently just bad as his partner's awful behavior as a whole. OP shouldn't be yelling and getting visibly angry, but at the same time he did absolutely nothing wrong in the dumb Cinderella ""argument"" before the girlfriend intentionally escalated it in a public way purely to pick a fight. This relationship is super unhealthy, but it doesn't look to me like OP is even close to being equally at fault like people in this thread are insisting. I get the feeling that sentiments here would be a lot different if genders were reversed."
628,"Change of medications? Recent personal life issues? Higher stress at work? Are you sleeping ok?

Generally there's a cause for this. I think the real question is are you feeling ok? Are you down more often? Is something in this relationship bothering you at all? It can be a smell, an attitude, some missing conversation.  Is anything bothering you?"
629,"People, not just females, can be rude.  
This is not your bf's fault.  
It is not your fault.  
People can be rude.  

What you do have control over is how you respond to it and how you let it affect you and your relationship.  

If your bf is putting you on ignore at times, that is a problem to address immediately when it happens.   

A simple ""You do not treat me like that"" will suffice.  
Either he will modify his behavior, or he will not.  
And you will do what you need to do in response.    

Set your boundaries, lady. If you allow people to treat you poorly, they will."
630,"This is such a bad response. Using cocaine as a study aide is a valid concern. To anyone. To write this off as a matter of differing opinions or preferences is disingenuous at best. She is moving towards what could very easily become addiction, and even if he isn't in this for the long haul, I think it's fair of him to feel a sense of duty to say something about it even if she doesn't listen. That being said I agree with you, if she won't listen there isn't much to be done "
631,"i think she planned it.  all of a sudden, right before she needed to pay tuition she suddenly wants joint accounts.  and immediately after his transfer in she takes it all out and says she's not repaying because her tuition is their bill since they're living together."
632,"This by a thousand!

OP, this woman has manipulated and used you.  The worst part is that you are completely dependent on her generosity to keep a roof over your head.  Edit:  I also see you're dependent on her parent's good graces for your job.  If you had some money to fall back on it wouldn't be so dire but right now?  

Smile and make nice.

Grit your teeth and let her think you're disappointed but she's forgiven.  Meanwhile untangle your finances, wait for your next paycheck and privately look for accommodation.  Once you have somewhere to go, then let go of the emotions and go through the breakup process.  And perhaps start trying to find anew job.

I really hope a friend or your family can provide interim support.  This girl has done everything to keep her under her thumb.  The emotional manipulation and betrayal of your trust is unforgivable."
633,"Yeah, that's just a unnecesarry comment.
I don't know how you stayed with him, seeing that he has that trait."
634,"All reasons for not wanting to date someone, including the most abhorrent ones imaginable, are equally valid. As a separate matter, some are more hurtful to make explicit than others, like (in general), personal properties that are both widely stigmatized and not easily altered."
635,"I'm not sure it's helpful to treat this as your wife not trying hard enough: when she tries, it's seriously painful for her. It sounds like the only time she'd be able to have sex would be either by going through daily pain (dilators are not exactly a walk in the park), or by applying numbing creams so that she feels nothing. It also makes sense, not wanting to begin to develop a bond with one therapist over something so intimate, only having to walk away. You're not the expert in her condition, no matter how much research you do: she is. 

&gt;She's doing this for me, not herself.

This is probably exactly why she doesn't want to commit to daily pain and/or sex that she cannot feel. 

There are no magical fixes, and you trying to ""motivate"" her probably feels more like pressure to her. She's going to undergo therapy at some point, to help her deal with the other issues around her body. So, it may be a point that you two accept your incompatibilities or end the relationship.

It sounds like you and your wife just aren't compatible. She's made a choice that she prefers not having penetrative sex to the painful rigmaroles which would allow her to. For you, having penetrative sex is the important thing. 

It's up to both of you where next, but my suggestion would be perhaps to see a sex therapist *together*. This will likely address whether it can ever sexually work between you two. "

637,"I'm aware.  And I'm saying it's really, really dumb.

Religion makes people believe and follow through with some seriously stupid shit."
638,"Honestly, what I've gleaned from this post is you're planning to run away because you're sharing a room with your brother and you don't want to share your car, too. "
639,"I'm really proud of your girlfriend for handling that the way she did. She sounds like a badass. 

You on the other hand....you are immature and lack foresight and empathy. You need to leave her alone. Accept that your own stupid actions got you deservedly dumped and work on your own shortcomings to be a better person in the future. "
640,"It's not about stuff, it's about respect and happiness.  If you've made it clear that you feel unappreciated, and she didn't respond in a way that made you feel better, then... sorry, things aren't likely to get better.

There's no way to force your girlfriend to be gracious, or to stop being a mooch.  She is who she is.  Put the conflict in front of her in these terms: you aren't happy.  And if you guys can't resolve it in a way that makes you happy, there is no future.  Sorry."
641,Yeah I wouldn't be talking to you either. Why did you think it was okay to give his things away without even asking him first? That's disgustingly rude. You're completely in the wrong here and he's 100% justified in breaking up with you for this. 
642,"Number 2 is exactly right. She got to experience the warm and fuzzies that are a nice perk of donating something super cool to someone less fortunate without any of the actual sacrifice and selflessness that act normally requires. 

It's even shittier when you think about it like this. "

Look I'm all for taking proactive steps in your mental health, but she didn't even bother thinking about what you wanted and just did what she wants, and expects you to foot the bill for her. If you go back to her, she will realize that she can do anything she wants to you and it'll be okay because you'll always take her back and forgive her. Don't be used, and don't sacrifice your well being to help her."
646,"You're 27. You've literally spent 1/3 of your life to date obsessing over this. It's impacting on your ability to form new relationships. This isn't healthy or normal.

Therapy is probably a good idea. And maybe hold off on being in relationships until you have things figured out. It's really unfair on whoever you're dating if you can't commit to the present because you're stuck in the past.    "
647,Then why did you post here? People give you advice to help you out of this situation that clearly makes you terribly unhappy. Your boyfriend was the only one who supported your mental health and your independence and probably that's why your father didn't like him. Your father wants to see you a wreck of a person. You chose to be that when you separated from your bf. Without help and support for your mental health issues your life will keep getting harder and harder. What advice do you want now?
648,Your friends will tell someone else eventually even if you think that they can keep secrets

It's not going to be much consolation now, but you will be able to repay any costs once his life insurance is heir'd to you.   Most likely.

Avoid payday loans.  You have options.  Sign up for a credit card if you need to but a better option would be to ask your uncle for the money, also call the airport and tell them the situation.  I've heard they can help out in these situations if you can get a copy of the death certificate.  I could be wrong, but call and check.  I'd make it a one-way ticket personally.  Sounds like your boyfriend was just waiting for this to put it on you to break up with him."

If you aren't comfortable approaching her directly I would absolutely go to HR."

If it's her problem, why won't she hear me out or talk to me about it? Why would she go so far as to delete me from her life when I'm asking her to work things out? I know she cared for me so why is she acting like I'm a backstabber and our entire friendship has been a lie?"

That's why she's resentful, her easy and cheap late-life meal ticket realized this is bullshit and wants her own life.

Now she's trying to do everything she can to make you come crawling back to her, sabatoging your car, your dates, your moving out and cutting contact with you to make you feel isolated.

I only have one question for you:

Why do you let yourself be treated this way?"
668,[deleted]
669,"I think that it's time for you to seriously reconsider this relationship. The lack of a sex life coupled with her unwllingness to communicate with you about it is already causing resentment from you. It's only going to get worse the longer that this plays out. The thing is, if she has something that is so personal that's affecting her desire to have sex with you and she cannot trust you enough to talk with you about it after a year and a half, then it sounds like this is something that she should be seeking professional help for. From your last post, she doesn't see that as an option. So this is possibly a red flag.

Whatever the issue is, she's not being very fair about it with you. She's just expecting you to maintain this holding pattern for the foreseeable future and even then she may never tell you and just keep stringing you along. You'll be more and more miserable and resentful as each day passes. Don't do that to yourself, OP. Even though she may be great otherwise, this one thing is no small issue and it's causing problems. If she doesn't even try to talk with you about this issue in the next week or so, I would break things off with her citing sexual incompatibility. Just don't be a dick and use the break up as a means of pressuring her into telling whatever it is that bothering her and if she suddenly decides to want to tell you, refuse to listen because it's too little too late.

Edit: wording"

He chose to end the relationship rather than force you to convert to his religion - that was a wise and mature choice.  Religion (or the lack thereof) is important in a relationship.  It will hurt for now, but it will get better and you will move on.  Someday you'll be ready to look for someone who shares your values."

Edit: and according to your post history, you're also cheating on your boyfriend? Classy. "
691,"There are red flags and this appears to be escalating. 

Most relationships don't start out abusive, it's a gradual process and one day you're sitting in the hospital with a broken arm trying to figure out how the loving, exciting person you met could have done this.

It is not abusive *right now*. 
This is, at minimum, unhealthy. 

He moved you away from your friends and is angry you had close friends where you moved.

He discourages you from seeing your own friends and stops you from bonding with his.

He bad talks your family. As your relationship goes on, I guarantee this will turn into him trying to stop you from visiting them and not letting them stay with you, possibly reaching the point of trying to get you to stop talking to them entirely.

All of that is isolating. That is a *major* tactic to groom someone for abuse. He wants to cut off your outside support so you're dependent on him.

Now he's trying to make you do all the chores around the house and holding a higher income over your head. That isn't a respectful, equal partnership. It hints of potential financial abuse in the future.

He may start pushing you to be a housewife, he's laying the groundwork. Now, lots of people are housespouses/stay at home parents in healthy, loving relationships- but it makes you vulnerable to financial abuse. It's another step of isolation (no coworkers, no HR, no support), and being dependent on him."

Maybe you get a pass year 1, if you haven't been together for a long time but after that? Reminder on your phone and a ""hey how do you want to celebrate"" is basically the bare minimum one can do.

709,Congrats! You married a typical young military man! I saw other comments where you said you were with him less than a year before eloping. He's a child. You're a child. Military culture encourages this. He took leave and ditched you for a whole day without ever bringing it up for Star Wars? Girl you should be leaving this fool because it's going to be a ton of work to reprogram him. He's acting just like young dudes in his position do. Pro tip: don't marry someone that fast especially when the military is a factor. Always a mistake. 
710,I think he already did. 
711,"&gt; He might want a wife, but at 42, he doesn't want to start a family; if you had a kid this year, he would be 60 when that kid graduated high school. When you're 47, high in your career, he'll be retiring from work.

I agree with everything apart from that bit. He may well want a family if he doesn't have one. Whether that suits what the 24 year old sees her life as being is a different matter."
712,"Time for a serious talk. This should be the only time this happens (It shouldn't have happened at all), he's not a toy and his comfort should always trump her and her friend's fun. Saying that, I fail to see how it is fun to play dress up with a baby that is crying, trying to get away and probably has a sore face from falling over (and they filmed it? Like seriously WTF). 

If she fails to back down, I would seriously consider escalating to a doctor/lawyer/therapist/CPS because this is not the behaviour I would expect from anyone, let alone a mother. Also you might want to not let her friends anywhere near your son.  

"
713,"Seconding this advice. Please do not respond to the man who repeatedly assaulted and threatened a minor with no remorse. Block his email address, block his number if he starts harassing you via phone, and block him on social media if you're able to find him.

720,"I think the main issue here is that you lack self confidence. Yes, some women would think it difficult to date someone in a chair, but that's mainly due to thinking you wouldn't be able to do 'normal' things together. I don't hold this wiewpoint personally but that's because I have spent a lot of my life around someone in a chair and that's all it is a chair/physical disability....I and a lot of others look past that and so don't feel like all women are tainted in their views.
Anyway, what I think is that you need to work on your confidence as girls like confidence in a man. Whether you do this by asking your Doctor to put you in touch with someone you can speak to, have some CBT, or whatever. 
Also, put yourself out there. Join a group, class, something you are interested in, for example gaming or cooking or Art or writing, anything you like to do so you can meet new people and just build your confidence. Don't go anywhere with the intention to meet someone, just focus on getting that confidence to let others see who you are and what you're about.

723,"I see three viable solutions here...
1.  Break up and find someone with a similar libido.
2.  Try having sex more.  It sounds crazy but there are a lot of challenges (sex every day for a month is one) that can actually stimulate your libido and get you going.  Also, it forces you to talk more and have more alone time with your partner which is great for a relationship.
3.  Let him sleep around and become comfortable with it.

I think what this comes down to is picking the lesser of evils.  With that being said, if you're feeling uncomfortable at the idea of him being with someone else imagine when he actually has sex with someone or continues to for years.  Can you handle this for that period of time?  Open relationships are very tricky and you don't sound like you would be comfortable with one.  By the way, how has he managed his libido for the past four years?  This sort of thing normally surfaces a little earlier in the relationship. "

I mean, my sister had to come and watch me work.  On a PC. In my Office. Without a window.  And she watched me for a half hour. And was still really confused that this was my job.


Unfortunately, her behavior is reinforced by her friends and her society.  


You have a few options to handle this:

- Set up strict times - for multiple times in a day- of when you'll call her and how long you can chat.  

- You can try sending her pics of what you're doing or what you see when you travel, but that might spur more questions and concern.

- Brainstorm some topics that you two can talk about that she can also relate, ie Bollywood movies, or the latest outfits, cooking, fitness..

- Do you have an activity that just you and your mom do?  And one day/night set aside to do it?  If you can set this up, then she should feel happier and calmer. My mom likes to do a spa day with me, not restaurants, not movies.

748,"1. This is more than just ""I should have asked first"". I think you fundamentally misunderstand how hobbies and such work, and why he does what he does. You need to focus on not just the fact that you gave away something without asking, but the fact that you thought that just because he has a new toy that he wouldn't want his old ones (which BTW, he probably was planning on trading for his new army if he wasn't going to use them).

Then again, my parents raised my brother + I quite the same way and that we got things taken away when we acted out. Yes, it sucks when your a child and in those moments but its by no means traumatic. I appreciate my mum and dad having the sense to discipline us.

753,How can you say you're on the same page? 
754,"There are three things I can think of that no one has mentioned yet:

1. The idea that you pay for a bicycle once then never pay for anything again is ludicrous. I know nothing about bicycles, so I can't tell you frequency &amp; cost of maintenance, but I can tell you that there will absolutely be costs along the way to replace parts as they wear out. Is your boyfriend going to tell you that you shouldn't replace things because it costs more money? Or had he just not thought that far ahead?

2. It's unreasonable to think that's you will commute on the bicycle every single day. Sometimes, you may feel ill, or there may be a weather condition that makes it unsafe. You may at some point e injured &amp; unable to use the bicycle. Again, I don't cycle, but I assume that people that do also still take other forms of transportation when conditions are unsafe or they aren't feeling well. So would your boyfriend try to tell you it's a waste of money to pay for the metro when it's snowing out, since you already have a bike?

3. I don't see a backup plan in place here. Does your boyfriend have a car? Is he able to pick you up if you get a flat miles from home or get edged off the road by a car? Or are you completely on your own to figure out any emergency scenarios?

Riding a bicycle can be a wonderful form of exercise. But the idea that you have to purchase &amp; ride a bike because someone else tells you to is kind of ridiculous. There are a lot of factors to consider, like whether you're a confident rider, how safe your commute is on a bicycle, etc. I don't see any of that being considered here. "

758,"You're 17, and have been in this relationship for a year. Let me be blunt: this relationship is not going to last. that has nothing to do with whether or not he kicked you; it's just statistics.

I will occasionally counsel people that an incident of physical abuse can, under the right circumstances, with appropriate measures, if both parties really work for it, be allowed to pass. The situation you are in does not meet a single one of my criteria, except for his remorse.

Even if you decided to try it, you and he would go through a long, painful process of trying to make it work, taxing yourselves terribly, and then, in two or three years, you would break up because you are not yet the person you're going to grow into. Neither is he. 

He, unless he is *incredibly* lucky, is going to grow into the kind of guy that hits his wife or girlfriend. The single best thing you can do to help him avoid that is to dump him, immediately, and make sure he knows why.

You can choose to invest three years that you should spend growing into your adult self trying to help your BF grow into an adult self that is not a domestic abuser, or you can invest those three years into someone that will grow into a good person, and who will help you grow as well. (of course, you'll probably break up with that person, too, but for better reasons)

I hope you make the right choice."
759,"In addition to involving the school, make a point of inviting the other kids to your house for get togethers. Maybe start with a movie night. 

Be the cool parent who has snacks. Encourage the kids to come to yours after school. Do not let the Johnson kid in, maybe let the little sister in as long as she behaves herself. 

It's a pity to have to helicopter their play like this, but this is a case where your daughter is either traumatized or isolated. "
760,Well take it out first
761,"Oh nope, was just waiting at one near my house cause I didn't want my cat to see me leave again (shes young and meows when I leave for now). After he told me he would be another hour I just said I was going home and went grocery shopping."
762,"&gt;After all this time, they've gotten to know each other, and became friends. 

&gt;I suppose what my question is, would it be unfair to ask him to stop hanging out with her? He doesn't even need her anymore, why do they still need to workout together? I don't want him to end up cheating.

I don't understand.

He has a female friend, completely platonic, what is the issue?  They are workout buddies for godsake..."
763,"Yeah I don't see any issue here. They clearly are friends because they have working out in common, nothing wrong with having a support person. "
764,"OP's boyfriend is higher up in the company. I think he gets seniority here. Or, we can make it a sexist issue for funsies.  

Edit: he's not only higher up, he's a cofounder. This is not about OP being a woman. "
765,"Totally agree with that. I'm a trans-woman, and when I was a kid there's no way I'd have been allowed to experiment with gender roles. I'd completely disagree with pushing it either way."
766,"Regarding false positives, these can still happen if there was a sample swap or contamination. Precautions are taken, but... accidents can still happen. "
767,"IT IS NOT YOUR PROBLEM TO HELP FIX HIM

Honestly he's a grown man and if he hasn't figured out how to not beat on women in front of their children, he never will. 

By the way, beating her in front of her kid also counts as child abuse, did you know that? Yeah. He could be convicted of child abuse. Because it IS abusive to psychologically damage a kid like that."
768,"First of all, this is 2017. A girl can use a vibrator/dildo all she wants and without your permission.

Secondly, if you two weren't exclusive she doesn't need to give you details about other people she is sleeping with. If you are exclusive, then you aren't entitled to details about her past other than what she's comfortable sharing. 

"
769,Maybe don't put things off?
770,"The OP says she was experiencing ""pains."" Given the symptoms, along with past history of infection, the OB/GYN would certainly want to test, regardless of routine (symptom-free) exam protocols."
771,"If it's obviously inappropriate and makes OP uncomfortable, he NEEDS to know about that. His discomfort is secondary to her unwillingly sharing a bed with a kid who thinks it's ok to mastubate while he thinks she's sleeping. You're replying like teens just cannot be taught about consent and have no control over their dicks. "
772,"The thing is the group is pretty junior (other than Michael and I), so I think they are used to Michael being ""in charge"" (though I haven't observed any dynamics similar to what happened between us). I hope people didn't notice to be honest, because ironically it doesn't leave a good impression of me if people see that he ""dominates"" me in meetings."
773,"&gt;The true kicker is he just doesn't care what I'm having to go through, he's not even pretending to look for a job, he said he would divorce me if I even mention taking his computer back and I'm tempted to oblige him




Do it.



Hell, print off the divorce papers and leave them in the emply space where his gaming system once sat.



He is punishing you for being happy and finding a job you are about."
774,That's such a great idea. Thank you so much. I'll do that asap. 
775,"I'm so sorry. I'm sure you know this, but it wasn't easy. And honestly if it wasn't for my baby I don't know if I would have been strong enough. 

Bless you xx"
776,"I've experienced that hard core. I've been interested in guys who will actually insult me for not being what their idea of a dream girl is. One dude actually got pissed at me because I don't love zelda, and he wanted a girl that would play all the same games as him and fan girl over zelda. Okay bud, there's more the life than fucking video games. 

I don't lead with the angle, but I do have a rather large fan base, which has extended locally. Most of the people in my age group that belong to the ""nerd"" demographic know of me. I went to a gas station 2 hours away from my hometown when I was on a road trip and the guy inside asked me if I was *insert name here*. 

"
777,"Are you able to at least do it over the phone or Facetime? Tone of voice counts for a lot in emotional conversations like this. I think it's probably a good idea to do it sooner rather than later, but also agree that email isn't the right medium for it."
778,"Regardless of who's vagina it's molded after, it's a fleshlight - there's no comparison between a toy and a throbbing, reactive human. And the molding is expensive and unnecessary. 

I'm sure he didn't mean to hurt your feelings. But whether the mold is based off you, some porn star or a generic vagina, the fleshlight is going to feel like an impersonal fake vagina. So don't take it too seriously. "
779,"I'd straight up send her &amp; him a text message if  you can telling them their behaviour has made you uncomfortable and that you don't want anything to do with them. You've already told her you've no interest in her husband yet she keeps setting you up to be groped, great mate there.  Block them and keep the text message as evidence if they harass you any further. If you see them in the street either ignore or be a grey rock. "
780,"You are placing entirely too much stock in the magical power of a wedding to correct abusive habits.

She screams and yells as a response to disagreement of any magnitude, and she thinks this is normal.  What mental gymnastics are you doing to believe that there is even a tiny chance that this will get better after you're married?

The (VERY accurate) rule of thumb is that bad relationships are at their best on the wedding day.  It's all down hill from there, so if you're on the fence about leaving now in a year or so you'll be willing to cut your fucking arm off to get away from her.  By that stage, you're paying for a divorce lawyer.

You should not be getting married.  No way in hell."
781,"I did the same thing, but only for six years. We spent the last year in therapy because once I announced I was ready to leave he decided he was ready to work. By then I think we were already too far apart. 

I'm now less than six months into our separation and happier (alone) than I've been in years. I actually have positive forward momentum in my life, which is something I'd either forgotten or never felt to begin with, but it's amazing. 

Do the work, op. Get therapy. Be honest with your husband about your needs and feelings. Brutally honest. It's hard but it's crucial. If you need to go then go. 

You don't owe anyone an explanation for whatever decision you make. 

Best wishes. "
782,"&gt;I feel sorry for her but on the other hand I find totally hypocritical that all these years she was giving me moral lessons about my diet giving speeches and now it is clear that she ate behind my back all kinds of junk food.

Do you know this to be true or are you just assuming that because she had a heart attack?  Because at 27 it's WAY more likely to be genetic factors than poor eating."
783,"You donated, she thanked you. That is a good conclusion to the conversation, nothing more from your side is required."
784,"There is a great support group at Chumplady.com.  

You will get the best settlement and the least resistance if you file right away and get him while (1) he feels guilty and (2) he thinks he has his girlfriend for a soft landing point.  Take advantage of this.  DO NOT LEAVE YOUR HOME.  Try to kick him out, if possible.  If you agree to ""counseling"" he'll have better opportunity to run up bills, hide money, assassinate your character to family and friends, etc.  Hit fast and hard, then walk away.  

Take notes about the things you do for the kids, the ways you are there for them, the way you show up for school functions and such.  It will help you get the best custody arrangement.  If you can document ways that he lets them down or doesn't show up, even better.  Be very careful about venting to your kids, though.  It can be considered alienation and look poorly on you.

Keep a journal of the bad things he says and does to you, ways he has let you down, ways he had betrayed your trust, ways he tries to blame you for his poor morals.  At some point he will realize how inconvenient and expensive a divorce is compared to having a mistress and may try to make amends.  He will be charming and make promises, but your life will be much better without a cheater in it.  Difficult?  Maybe, but no worse than being the marriage police for the rest of your life.  Wondering if that itch is an STD, wondering where the money is going, wondering why he is so aloof and distant, wondering if he is really at the gym or work...

"
785,"I was in your situation but I was the ex. My ex got himself a new girlfriend before we were even broken up... and we found out about each other about eight months later, after I had dumped him for entirely unrelated reasons. Meaning, he cheated on us both, with each other.

And honestly? I feel sorry for her, because her entire relationship with him is based on a lie. I don't know what he told her, but if she knew what had really gone on behind her back, she would have kicked him to the kerb if she had any backbone. But, they are still together, either because he is lying to her or because she is lying to herself.

Your husband has been feeding you the same kinds of lies. If I were in your position I would try to get all the facts. Maybe even ask his family or his ex to tell you what they know. It may taste sweeter to swallow a comforting lie, but I think you know it will gnaw at you forever unless you try to find the truth.

There is a small chance that your husband had a good reason for his bad behaviour – to me it looks like cowardice, fear of moving on from his wife until he knew he had somewhere to go. How does that sit with you?

"
786,I wish it was as easy as telling him to move out but unfortunately he isn't going to do that just because you told him to. He is way too far in denial to do that any time soon. I would try to at least stay in touch with him to stop his boyfriend from isolating him further. Take him to the doctor if necessary and try to call the police if you know that something is happening. Finally keep telling him that his boyfriend is an ass. He needs a sane perspective. 
787,"I agree your boyfriend should have told you as soon as he knew that was the plan, and I'm very concerned by the fact that he went out to a bar on a night when he was supposed to be driving. Not making it to dinner because you were so upset over what seems a fairly minor derailment of your plans is a bit of an over the top reaction.

I'm wondering if you've felt like he's prioritised his family over you before? Is this just another example of a trend you've noticed? If my boyfriend did something like that, I wouldn't care, because I know that our family is his number one priority. If I didn't feel like that, it might be the straw that broke the camel's back. "
788,"It's your body, you have the final say about what happens to it. Frankly it seems like you're fundamentally disconnecting on some really big issues and your fiance isn't mature enough to push back against his parents/get on your side.

&gt; I have a history of abuse with other relationships, so saying no is not an easy thing for me.

Please, before you get married or have kids, or lock yourself into a life with people that don't care about your feelings, work on this issue. Saying no is a skill that you can practice and get better at - advocated for yourself and your needs and don't just passively accept everyone else's desires because you think you have to."
789,"&gt; what's so appealing about gaming and encouraging OP to game with her husband.

ah, I got you. Interesting people are suggesting that as a solution when they have a baby to take care of. I can't imagine there'd be much time for partner gaming until the baby falls asleep"
790,"Yikes, I don't know if I've ever read a better ""told you do"" story.  I wouldn't go out of my way to coddle his feelings, instead reserve your sympathy and emotional energy for his parents.  Your husband behaved like a dumbass and hopefully this event will cause him to take his politics and choices more seriously.  And while you are right to feel frustrated and disappointed in him, do try to keep perspective - he didn't personally elect Trump.  Given our electoral college system, his voting in a red state likely meant nothing.

I would expect your husband to grow and mature from this experience, and would be seriously be concerned if he did not."
791,"As a fellow brown person, I know where you are coming from. We are more or less ingrained by our culture that white is seen as beautiful. (we have a product called fair and lovely for godsake haha). You have kinda just taken it to a more extreme level. Just be happy with what you have. "
792,"i thought she did a terrible terrible faux pas in a social setting and then wondered why the rest of the post did not mention it
"
793,"Thanks so much. That thought has passed through my mind numerous times about him staying to avoid paying me anything. Although the odd thing is- I really do think he wants this marriage, and I do think he really loves me. He really can never verbalized any coherent reason he thinks I'm at fault too. Bc to be honest there isn't any! The issue is he is incapable of appropriately being in a relationship. He doesn't seem to have any normal amount of compassion or sympathy for others and doesn't see the error of his ways. I just got tired of being the one to point this out. I can't make him suddenly have the skills needed to be in a healthy relationship. "
794,"I received a similar message from a woman who actually used her real name.  I checked out her page and took notes before she blocked me. 
 My husband denied knowing her over and over, getting angry when I brought it up.  He was having an affair with her.  Not saying your boyfriend is, but don't dismiss her too quickly."
795,"Then why block your bf from stuff? I can see both sides. If you are going to have guy friends you can't be blocking your bf from stuff then crying when he doesn't trust you. You can't have it both ways. 

Your lies dominoed, all because you tried to avoid possible jealousy. Than you knew there may be a possible problem which may have been there before because you blocked your bf from snap chat?? 

"
796,"&gt; I just want him to go back to the person he used to be. I know it's in there.

You can't make him do that. He has to choose to do it himself. "
797,"If it disgusts her/makes her uncomfortable/creeps her out, that's just spiraling them a breakup. He can be an understanding partner and not engage in a kink that makes her uncomfortable. :)"
798,[deleted]
799,"Okay that's good. As for reporting her, strongly consider if it will actually do her any good. You know your sister, we don't. Will reporting her force her to recognize she can't keep living her life this way and make changes? Or will reporting her just make her resent and blame you for getting her in trouble?


I know morally you don't agree with what she's doing, but that doesn't mean you have to be the one to pull the trigger. Consider if the emotional fall out will be worth the good it will do. 


I would tell your sister that your parents told you what she's done and in good conscious you cannot support her actions by housing her. Encourage her to do the right thing and turn herself in (or at least pay back the pissed off client). If she's serious about starting over and making a change the first step is to accept responsibility and the consequences that follow. 


Until she can do that, you cannot support her or enable her actions. "
800,"You're not an introvert. You are immature and afraid of intimacy. News flash, girls want intimacy with their boyfriends. If she needs verbal affirmation, stop making excuses and give it to her. "

806,"That date jar idea sounds great! Will look into FB events--thank you for your suggestions, it's very helpful."
807,"Your partner isn't responsible for your childhood trauma.  He's responsible for listening to you and respecting the things that trigger you.  Joking about abandoning you isn't funny when you've previously been abused with those same jokes.  Although it is a normal joke, it's cruel to knowingly use that joke on someone who has a fear of abandonment.  He isn't responsible for your trauma, but he should be respectful of you.

You need to talk to your partner about things that trigger you.  The idea of being left stranded is clearly one of those things.  Your partner may not understand that although he isn't the one who abused you, the fears and triggers are ingrained.  A good partner will respect you and avoid doing those things whether or not he truly understands how trauma works.  Be open with your partner so he doesn't accidentally hurt you or feel the need to walk on eggshells for fear of triggering you."
808,"I grew up in a time before the internet so I am always a little confused when people say that they don't know what to do or how to plan dates or anything. I can literally speak into my phone - ""Hi Google. Search for low-cost ideas for going on dates,"" and my phone will give me a list. 30 years ago this was something we didn't even see in movies, it was that far-fetched.  You have the entire internet to search for fun and interesting date ideas. Use it! 
 
You keep saying you're an ""introvert"" and she's an ""extrovert"". I understand an introvert is someone who does just fine with others, but for limited amounts of time. I have never seen ""introvert"" defined as someone who just wants to stay home and never do anything. I know a zillion introverts who go to parties, take vacations, enjoy tons of activities - it's just that if a lot of people are around, they might leave a little earlier than others. That's all. ""Introverted"" does not in any way mean ""wants to stay at home all the time"". 

Relationships take energy and effort. I had a friend who wanted a dog REALLY BADLY, so she adopted a dog. Unfortunately, dogs need love, and care, and potty breaks, and my friend worked 12+ hours per day and enjoyed going out with friends, so her dog was stuck in a crate all day and night, and was miserable. Even though she loved the dog, she realized she did not have the time and energy to devote to it, and she had to give it up, even though it broke her heart. It was the right thing to do, because the dog deserved better. If you can't devote time and energy into your relationship, you may have to consider that a relationship does not fit in with your life right now. Or at least a relationship with a woman who wants some attention and dates and time with you.

813,"&gt; I'm amazed that apparently reddit thinks having someone pay for ALL of your expenses in exchange for some help is somehow ME taking advantage of THEM.

I mean, if your going to cover someone's expenses so they can take care of you, then why not just hire a care-giver? Otherwise you're just mixing personal relationships with money and the expectation that they'll care for you."
814,"If my significant other suggested that I might cheat on him if left alone with a bunch of dudes, I'd consider ending the relationship right there. Why does she have to be considerate of his feelings when he's just insulted and hurt her, *and* seems to think he was justified? 

Anger seems more than appropriate to me. He's overstepped."
815,Leave. Waiting to 35 to start having kids already risky. Finding out he won't want kids at 35 and being singles a good way to end up on fertility treatments and/or adopting. 
816,"&gt; Unless, of course, he forgets to lock the door and/or leaves it open. 

That's it right there. I grew up in a house with weapons too, but they were double locked in a secret location. There's no way in *hell* I'd be comfortable with having an enormous weapons collection in my home guarded only by one locked door. As I said in my comment, it only takes one mistake.

No. He turned what should have been a fun, sibling bonding moment into an unfairly, abusive, grudge match.

818,"Your post gives off that impression... I think a lot of people thought the same thing. 

Edit: I went back and read your post- you've only been dating for a year and he's had multiple chances to pick you up from the airport. Flying multiple times in the span of a year typically implies flying a lot for work. Do you just go on a lot of vacations? "
819,"This is incredibly shitty. Incredibly. I mean, the fact that he took a day of leave to spend time with his friends and didn't even tell you is bad enough, but it was on your *birthday*. Following it up with sex (the kind that you're not even really into!) does not constitute an apology. He sounds like an exceptionally selfish and shitty person, to be honest. I would have a very hard time forgiving this even with an apology. 

Assuming you don't want to leave him (although this pattern of behaviour does not bode well), you definitely need to sit down and tell him that what he did was awful and unacceptable. He needs to make it up to you properly and, more importantly, he needs to put you first."
820,"It is a red flag, to me, that he brought it up without prompting. I think, as others have said,  that he lied about how much he loves it and figured you'd get over it, and rhe instead of being honest threw you under the bus. 
My bf actually really likes to give oral, and he doesn't talk about how much he likes it or talk about how much he did it in the past with other partners. If someone has to talk about how into something they are all the time, that's kind of a orange/red flag ro me, ESPECIALLY if he talks about it but doesn't do it. 

I would confront him about this, and also work on your confidence. This comes down to confidence and communication. Please don't think you're disgusting, because you're not. This isn't a you problem, it's a him problem"
821,"Very fair question to ask. It's been another tense subject in our relationship. He's a wrestler and says he's on contract with a company and can't work for anyone else right now. However, the company he's on contract with hasn't paid him and hasn't brought him out to do any work. At least that's what he says. So yes, I am supporting him. And he refuses to get professional help. He's very stubborn about it and says therapy has never helped him in the past."
822,"I'm not allowed to dislike someone for doing something I don't agree with? And while I directly said I despise her, I didn't say I didn't despise him. Like I said I have 0 desire to talk to them, either of them.

823,"Okay, this is not your boyfriend's fault. There are a lot of double standards here in the comments. Can you imagine if the genders were flipped? If it was a girl getting groped by her sister's boyfriend? I feel sorry for the poor guy. He doesn't want to be sexually harassed. He's told her to cut it out several times. He's made it clear that he doesn't like the way she's treating him. He asked his brother to intervene, and he hasn't. I don't think there's much either of you can do about it. His brother could, but he refuses to.

The only other thing I could think of is to leave whenever she pulls that shit. His brother knows it's inappropriate. He's just trying to pretend he doesn't. It makes his relationship a lot easier if he has his head burried in the sand.  Maybe if there's a constant negative consequence to her actions, he'll be less forgiving and more aware of them. That, or he might distance himself even more from his brother. Either way, your boyfriend shouldn't have to put up with this shit. "
824,"Possible he was just yesing you and just going opposite to alleviate your concerns? You say these high powered women intimidate me, he says high powered women suck, I'm not into them. Pretty cut and dry guy response here. 

Find out if it's real in the way he treats you, does he treat you like you are stupid? Just ask him if he'd have an issue if you ever started a career.

You can start by calling the police. They can help you in this. This is not  a number you just call only when you're already really in trouble.

Good, that'll land him in prison if you just record it and relay your worries to the police first. "
831,Your dad is grossly unprioritizing you. What happens if there's not someone in the house to help you in the bathroom or with the steps? Does he just expect you to be trapped because your older and don't need as much help anymore? That's a horrible thing to say to a disabled person. 
832,He used her account and didn't switch the card to his. He spent her money and then didn't pay her back until she read the statement and asked him for the money. Also he could have asked.

If he works with a low morale, he will soon become one of the shitty team!"
834,"I dated a guy in a wheelchair for a while (it ended due to other things - not the chair). 

One of my favorite memories is of a time I visited him in his apartment just to chill. I was reading and he was playing a video game when he asked me to grab something from the kitchen that was just out of his reach. Without thinking, I said, ""Get off your ass and get it yourself.""
Pause. We look at each other. There's that ""oh god I made a horrible mistake"" pause. I'm about to apologize until I'm blue in the face when he just starts cracking up. Nearly falls out of the chair. 

To this day we're friends. And I still call him ""hot wheels"" or ""lazy legs"". 

Yes some girls are going to be turned off by the chair. But to be honest? You don't want them. My ex acts as if he doesn't see the chair, or he becomes ""that guy"" about it and uses it as humor (tho don't do this all the time - it'll get old fast). If you act in ease with it, it'll help whoever you're interested in. A chair is not a death sentence if it's not electrocuting you. "

836,He's vain for wanting to be sexually attracted to the person he loves?
837,"Thanks for the response, im about to head to bed so I won't be able to reply to anyone for the night but will get back in the morning.

She is an *incredibly* spiteful person, always has been, and I've seen it directed toward others since day 1. You are correct that I cannot prove it was her who texted me, but I have no idea who else would (I don't have any enemies or stalkers I am aware of) and my gut is really telling me it was her.

Hopefully I can pull moving on off, that's been my plan since this started, but it really does wear me down to see her all the time, and every day it's impacting my focus on school more and more, and I take that very seriously"
838,"I've read many similar stories of boundaries being crossed at bachelor/bachelorette parties and it's always made me paranoid! Some people see it as their ""last night of being single"" or some other bullshit, when that title was lost as soon as they decided to be exclusive with their SO. People like that shouldn't be in monogamous relationships if they can't remain faithful when their SO's aren't watching (and when they know their friends would never rat them out)."
