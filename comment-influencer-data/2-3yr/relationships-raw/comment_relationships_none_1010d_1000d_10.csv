1,"I dunno, join a Christian group or something?"
2,"Wait, are you making a joke right now? I can't tell, there's too much estrogen in my system."
3,Where did you get your wife is a narc? I mean it makes no sense what you are talking about.
4,"I think most penile fractures happen with the woman (well, receiver) on top. Are you concerned about appearances, or about snapping your dick, again? From what you say, I don't think appearance is going to be an issue. If it's fear of further dick damage, I think the cure is to just let the horse get back on you. Maybe make sure you're on top the first few times.
"
5,"I think age rank is one of the issues here. The oldest tends to get the harshest punishment and judgement (I know my oldest sister certainly did. I'm the youngest of 5 and there is an 8 year difference between myself and the oldest).
Parents usually have a trend of loosening their hold the older they get. My sisters had to be home by 10pm and were waiting up, while they would let me stay out late and I'd even come home and they'd be sleeping already with a dark house!

As far as your resentment and hurt is concerned, it's a matter of do you work through it and forgive on your own, do you want to make a big stink about it (bring it up in conversation which will most definitely lead to an argument and ""you're an adult now get over it"" conversation) ad come back to fight another day, or go out with a bang and walk away from your family because of it.

I recommend the first option. It's hard, but eventually you have to choose to value the relationship with your family, or value the anger you have toward them for not letting you date as a teen and hold you hostage for having a boyfriend.
It's a matter of priority. You can talk it out, but there is no guarantee that anything will come out of it but more anger and resentment."
6,"I went back at 30 after many, many years of not having a clue what I wanted to do when I grew up. Almost done this leg of the journey and will be continuing on for more certs and and another degree.

Being at school with youngins is definitely an adventure!

OP's boyfriend is a tool. She should dump him for being such a downer."
7,"The way this is phrased made me wonder, maybe the two of them got in a fight and this was the best friend's way of getting back at the girlfriend, by telling him about something she did years ago. And subtly implying it's still going on because the accounts still exist, even if they're abandoned."
8,OMG. I didn't read it until now. What a mess. 
9,"Except you're the best man and the person they want to officiate the wedding is your dad, so ""staying out of it"" isn't a realistic option. If you don't say anything it will just blow up bigger later. "
10,"Use your words!

Ask her what dating in Kenya is like, how it usually works, her personal preferences, etc. Then tell her how dating in the US usually works, for you at least, your preferences, etc. If I were you, I'd be asking partly out of genuine curiosity and interest in her culture, and partly to avoid major misunderstandings.

Stuff like exclusivity is very important. I mean, enough misunderstandings about that happen between two westerners, so it's good to be very up front about whether you're dating anyone else and whether you're officially exclusive with each other.

I have zero clue about any other specific aspects to ask about.. Hopefully you bringing it up will lead to an interesting discussion that gives you both a good understanding of expectations and such."
11,"If I've learned something is that people who fuck you over cannot and will not take responsibility for their actions. He cheated on you and left for a younger woman but it's ""all your fault"" in his eyes. Him losing his family... Same. He cannot accept the fact that his actions alienated his children and it wasn't your doing. As far as his family goes well sometimes families can be sensible and realize that their precious son fucked up but in my experience that's not the case and however messed up the situation is they stick together and are in denial of any wrong doing. So much so that any negative consequences can't be the fault of the member of their family and it has to be the other person's fault. 

Your husband is an ass I am sorry he hurt you. Be proud of yourself for putting your children first and have the best life you can have. You are a single mom doing it all, get rid of any people who will not support you. While they don't have to ""denounce their son"" putting the blame on you is ridiculous. "
12,"Talk to your parents and show them the texts.  Monday is going to be hard but if you don't go...you don't get to control the story.  You need to go in there and be a little sad but firm on the fact that this had nothing to do with you.  Practice what to say and make sure your parents get the school to support you.  ""I'm sorry he had such mental health issues but he was actually my stalker"".  Somehow put it out there calmly again that this is just part of a pattern of abuse.  Careful Googling this but some abusers actually commit suicide as the ultimate abuse.

Be brave, and be aware that this may affect you in strange ways.  Be kind to yourself and don't hang out with people who aren't on your team.  You can do this."
13,"The person that he is when he is drunk is the same person that he is when he's sober, he's just better at hiding it from you. "
14,"Sexting is absolutely cheating. You did cheat. She deserves someone better, so let her move on. "
15,"Don't skip the photos, even if you only show half your face or less. You're still family!
"
16,This is so completely inappropriate. Please tell your prof. I would really want to know if my TA was trying to coerce students into sex.
17,"&gt; we wanted our approach to be to take things easy during the pregnancy and ""recharge"" before the baby comes.

That isn't how pregnancy works. This is (understandably, to a point, since it's the first kid) naive on your part.

Let's get one thing straight here: pregnancy is fucking awful. Society tries to tell people it's a gorgeous, wonderful thing and pregnant women prance around, glowing and happy. That is bullshit. 

Pregnancy is work. Preparing for the baby is work. It's *hard.* 

Her body is changing. Her moods are changing. She's puking, ill, tired, sore, uncomfortable, and likely sleeping like shit. *She is literally physically incapable of doing normal and ""easy"" right now.*

The fact that you aren't willing to do a *tiny* bit more work than normal because ""It's not the unrealistic and completely naive plan we set!"" is...well..kinda pathetic, honestly. 

She's not asking for even *real work from you.* Hell, *what she is asking barely even requires effort.* Fold the laundry. Pay a tiny bit more on a bill. That's it. That's nothing. That is literally fucking nothing- especially when you factor in that she is **literally growing a human inside of her right now.**

It's time for you to man the fuck up. "
18,"You can't see single a single one of my tattoos, and I have eight. 

My husband has sleeves and it's never been a problem at any job. "
19,"I am not down with the tracking, but I just wanted to second or third the RoadID idea. I have no idea about the app, but I love the actual physical bracelet. I love having one, I wear it even if I'm just rolling out to grab a 6 pack or whatever. It makes me feel safer and it makes my boyfriend feel better about me being a bike nut. 

"
20,"I'd wager she does realize but she's still struggling for their approval. And she is, on some level, willing to sacrifice her kids to her parents for it. I think the wife needs some individual therapy to toughen up and see how that will never happen (their approval). "
21,"I was thinking that, or that she hasn't even booked her ticket yet."
22,[deleted]
23,"You're right, and it's a disgusting, backward, harmful thought process. "
24,"Preferences are fine. I prefer blue eyes, but I find brown eyes attractive too. I prefer straight hair, but I've fallen in love with curls before. I find white people attractive, but that doesn't take away from other ethnicities who are also attractive. 

That's why you're controversial and that's why I told you to phrase it better. Having a preference shouldn't involve putting down everybody who doesn't fit your preference, and you're implying that non-white women are disproportionately unattractive to you. 

And that's fine, you're a free man in the U.S. Just don't expect your family to feel warmly about you if you go around saying and implying this stuff in front of them.

"
25,"Her dad mistakenly thinks that this will help her, but it won't. He is enabling her, which is sadly not uncommon for people trying to help loved ones. She needs professional help and calling the police was absolutely the right thing for you to do.

By calling only her dad, you and he would both be doing her a disservice. It may not seem like it in the moment, but she is not well and needs more help than you or her dad could ever provide. You are not ruining her life by calling the police. Her dangerous behavior and refusal to get treatment are the only things ruining her life. Getting the authorities involved gives her a better chance of getting proper treatment, and it keeps you and others safe from her destructive actions.

"
26,Definitely not your fault. Asking people out is normal and fine. His behaviour is the problem here. 
27,"So you would be totally fine if your husband went on holiday with a single woman for 2 weeks? You wouldn't feel the least bit put out?

I think even the most reasonable person would have a 'what the fuck' moment about that, especially if this person was attractive. "
28,"Seems to me like you have a pattern of twice a week sex, OP, and that when she feels loved, she wants sex more, but when she doesn't feel as loved, she doesn't want sex as much. 

Is it worth talking about? Absolutely. I think a sex therapist might be a great idea. But the only problem that you can directly control here is that *you* are *secretly testing her and mentally accusing her of intentionally manipulating you sexually.* That just is not ok. I just cringed when you said you acted extra nice one week. Like, you faked being a good partner and then when your girlfriend responded positively to your affection, you saw that as a *confirmation* that she's doing something wrong. WTF, man.

My big question: why aren't you talking about your sex life? When you had gone four or five days without sex while you were helping your friend grieve, why didn't you say, ""Hey babe, it's been longer than usual. Any reason you're not in the mood? Anything I can do to help? I want our sex life to be great.""? Why aren't you sitting down with her and saying, ""Hey, I've noticed this pattern. When things are going well, we have a lot more sex. But if XYZ happens, you don't want to have sex. I've made a connection with ABC, but I realize that might not be true for your experience. Can you see any pattern to our dry spells?"" Say that! And then listen to her.

You are making accusations based on questionable evidence, while excluding her own testimony from your condemnation of her. Don't make up your mind about what she's doing until you actually have some productive discussions about this subject. And do what it takes to have those discussions, even if it means counseling, because she is just as much a part of your relationship as you are, and deserves to be included in decisions that are made about it."
29,"If you're in the US with most carriers, she doesn't need to temporarily add you to insurance unless you are staying long term (like weeks/months) or live with her. Using her car for a few days when visiting with her permission is considered permissive use and you guys would be covered because insurance typically follows the vehicle."

31,There's some good advice in this thread but something I haven't yet seen here is *do not have unprotected sex with him.* He is at a high risk to pass you any number of diseases. Even if he says he always uses clean needles you have no way to verify that.
32,"It wasn't completely behind my back. As I said in my post she mentioned it, but we hadn't discussed it. She also called me right when she was done to tell me how excited she was about it and how fun it was. It may be a red flag, but I don't think it's a 'gigantic' red flag but maybe something we need to address. Maybe I'm getting defensive."
33,So... she didn't actually answer the question? Sounds super sketchy
34,"He wants this child so what if he refuses to sign away his rights? Than OP has to raise a baby, and pay a lot of money."
35,"If she's going to eventually break up with you, why not do it now?  

Pull the bandaid off quick vs the slow painful way. This will give you more time to find someone who really cares for you. "
36,"I find that a lot of people believe the right wing's propaganda about your care being substandard, long waits for treatment and the government choosing your doctor for you. It's a shame. Also, a lot of people feel our government is largely incompetent and don't want them ""messing with"" their healthcare by taking control of it. They'll happily use Medicare, though, so go figure."
37,"I disagree. If you're using your Spanish skills to talk about someone in terms you wouldn't want them to hear, which requires your relying on stereotypical assumptions about what a ""Spanish speaker"" looks like, and get caught out, it serves you right."
38,Oh wow.... sounds surprisingly familiar eh? Did you have to work with him for much longer after everything blew up?
39,"I went to a very well regarded public university, so a little bit different, but something that was hard to adjust to was not being the top of the class anymore. I graduated top 10 from my HS class, and then I show up on campus and everyone is the same way.

I had a friend in college who would make up stories.... Not necessarily ones that could easily been proven wrong, but to me it seemed like she tried to make herself stand out or was trying to impress people. That's who I was thinking of when reading this. I always figured she just had a hard time adjusting to an environment where everyone is a super overachiever and youre not special anymore. She seemed to stop doing it by senior year when she didn't care about impressing people anymore.

However, lying about serious illness is a lot different than trying to impress friends. To me that's unforgivable.  "
40,I really don't understand why cheaters care so much when their partner breaks up with them.
41,"Lol talk about petty, meaningless drama and mental baggage. FFS how is this drivel upvoted?

They're sleeping somewhere else. They didn't flat out refuse to go to Christmas. There's no need for all this ""when your parents are gone"" hullabaloo, telling her her parents are dying. Chill out. Grow up. Can the guilt trips.          "
42,"Um, it's exactly what happens in the champagne rooms of high-end full nude strip clubs.  It's practically their purpose"
43,"&gt; They said they grew up in a house like that and, so they wouldn't bother everyone else in the house, they figured out how to walk quietly. Just by walking on the balls of their feet.

This is exactly it. I grew up in a two-story home and my father worked shift work, so was often sleeping (below my room) during the day. I can run up a set of stairs and make zero noise. My calves also look awesome ;)

But yeah, the email OP posted doesn't look rude and I completely understand where they were coming from. I was not allowed to have friends spend the night when my dad was not off because my friends stomped around like cavemen without realizing it. Most people would be surprised how heavy they actually walk."
44,"&gt;I am just dragging her along

Are you sure you aren't?

What does ""get settled"" even more? If you propose tomorrow ,the ceremony will be 6mo to a year from now"
45,"Okay, I disagree with most of the other comments and I think you sound kind of obnoxious. Bringing food for OTHER people to eat, while you don't eat it yourself, because you're ""such a petite li'l thing"" is an obnoxious thing to do. 

If you bring food then you should also eat the food.

You should only bring enough that you are eating the same amount that the others are eating.

If you can only eat 1 macaroon in a sitting then only bring enough that everyone will also have one macaroon.

It's great that you love to experiment but you can experiment exactly the same by making smaller quantities. There's no reason for you to be making bulk quantities. "
46,"This doesn't sound at all like ""some crazy broad trying to rationalize her shitty decision"" to me. It sounds like life happened, you made decisions and found honest-to-goodness happiness. 
  
Thanks, this made me laugh and gave me a perspective I didn't really consider. Good luck with those miniature humans, lady.

Also your prose style is amazing. "

48,"If you don't want to be seen as rapey, *maybe you should stop trying to pressure her into doing sexual things she obviously isn't ready for and comfortable with.* If she sleeps with you just out of a pressure from you, are you really dense and arrogant enough to think she wont regret the choice?

She's not on her deathbed, you ridiculous child. She's 18. You don't want to prevent regret for her. You are going to end up **being** a regret.

Grow up and stop being horrible person. "

50,"It's really shitty to read a person's private thoughts. Of course you're hurt, but you had absolutely no business snooping. As someone who was snooped on (but hadn't written anything bad or mean), it's a huge betrayal of trust that is completely inexcusable. "
51,Steal her stuff. Blame it on the door being left open. People like that never learn until it affects them.

53,"This is what I was coming in to say. While the main person in the post may be lying, OP's other friend is wrong, too -there are so many different chemotherapy treatments, there is no be all, end all of side effects that is a blanket."
54,"Bonus points for admitting he could've reacted better (to be fair to OP'S dad, I can see how someone could be shocked into not reacting, especially if this was wholly out of character for the grandpa). 

Edit: my spelling get worse as my insomnia does..."
55,"It sucks that your schedule doesn't coincide with most people's days off, but I completely understand your family not wanting to have their parties on weeknights just because one person works odd hours. It sounds like you have a bit of a chip on your shoulder by saying they're purposely excluding you ""because you work a job they don't like"" when in reality, no one really wants to go out drinking at a lake bonfire on a Tuesday.

As for them tagging you in all the photos on Facebook, you could ask them to stop because it makes you sad that you missed out. "
56,"I feel like he's trying to create some sort of paper trail...all of his responses are super squeaky clean, and the post is only 4 hours old. He came to reddit instead of going straight to HR? Cmon, man."
57,"LoveIsRespect.org -- they have people standing by on phone and chat hotlines who can help you out as well as a lot of good resources to read through.

He's abusive. Abuse always escalates. You can't fix him and you *won't* fix him. He can fix himself when and if he realizes his behavior is a big fucking problem but he won't do it while he still has his victims around to abuse, like an alcoholic isn't going to recover if they're living in a house with other alcoholics. 

You have to get out. And you have to take the dogs with you. Wait for him to be gone at work, get your shit and get out."
58,it helps HIM stroke his male ego and boast about him being right all along.
59,It's not a contest. People can love lots of different kinds of family members.
60,"He didn't have a good reason when I asked him. He knows that what he did was wrong and that I could have left him.

I laid into him for days about this, but I don't think I ever got closer to understanding why he did it. It was such a stupid way of jeopardizing our relationship. I will never understand why he needed virtual high-fives from strangers to know that I'm attractive."
61,"I've been there. I'm 5'7"" and hourglass shaped. Pretty busty. But for some reason guys that I go out with tend to like petite, flat chested skinny girls (why the fuck they don't leave me alone since I'm not their type physically and just save me the guilt and anguish is beyond me.)

So I did the dieting thing, which turned into being diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. But even though I was underweight, ribs protruding, almost having heart attacks getting off the couch, I was still busty and my hips were still wide. Can't change my biology and no amount of weightloss would ever make me the shape they want.

Put it from your mind. If he wants to go find a model, he can damn well try. But if he stays with you, he loves and accepts you, so try to leave this insecurity behind. It's hard and I'm still trying, but you just keep doing you."
62,"I know the phrase ""work spouse"" is often used jokingly, but it's extremely inappropriate and disrespectful to the actual spouse or significant other. Being ""touchy and flirty"" while at work is crossing boundaries, and unless you want to get a reputation at work as someone who is unprofessional and untrustworthy, you should cut that shit out.

As for the guy, there is no legitimate reason to hide the existence of a spouse unless you have shady intentions or the type of egotistical personality that needs a constant supply of adoration."
63,"So after 2 years of no contact, you family still hasn't learned how to behave properly.

You should be happy you have a fiance who stands up for you."
64,That's okay. We all need that sometimes.
65,"I mean, he finally did the right thing and apologized and he was so uncomfortable with that *he took it back*.

WHO DOES THAT????

"
66,"&gt; You do like kids, and it hurts that they assume that you don't.

I Don't even think this matters at all. The core problem is they think being childless and single is a bad thing. But I agree with the rest. "
67,Stop dating someone who tells you to stop learning.
68,Eh no smooth juice is the only juice worth drinking. If I wanted pulp I'd eat a damn orange. 
69,"Wow, that is so embarrassing on her part. I couldn't even imagine being that obsessed with....*stuff*"
70,this... took me a long time to learn.  Thank you for saying it succinctly. 
71,"I absolutely agree!!! He's behaving badly. 

That's why I suggested they both read about it."
72,"Yeah that's not cool, he's showing you that he's willing to say whatever just because he THINKS it's what you want to hear, not even bc you've expressed what you'd like the answer to be.  I would really struggle trusting anything he said after this especially relating to proposal/marriage/future in general.  You're right to feel jerked around and I think this warrants a bigger conversation.  But then, how will you know he's being truthful in that conversation if he's continually lied before?? It's a shit situation and you gotta decide if you want to work through it. "
73,Twice a week isn't exactly a dead bedroom.

75,HOLY. SHIT. I didn't realize! Thank you for this.
76,"Or she falls on hard times, applies for government assistance, and the government goes after op for child support. "
77,"no-you are not doing anything wrong.  Cats sleep almost 90% of the day.  Your cat is a cat-your mom is your mom. If your husband cares that much h can hit a cat sitter to come in.

My guess is your husband doesnt want you to go for some completely different reason."
78,"I guess you haven't been around here too long, then... "
79,"Seriously, this confuses the hell outta me too. For me the confusion is over the fact that this is *her birthday*! Considering that most couples (especially married) have joint finances meaning that by expecting the husband to pay, you are literally expecting the birthday girl to pay for you to come celebrate her birthday with her....how does that make sense at all? IMO, someone should be offering to pay for her meal. Not the other way around. 

And it seems to me that OP was pretty clear about the type of event this was meant to be. "
80,"Genuinely, I remember having some wine and then changing to whiskey. The exact number - no clue. "
81,"You WERE supportive of him. He decided to take advantage of that. 

You didn't bring it on yourself. He's just a shitty boyfriend.

He should feel terrible. You told him ""yea sure explore your sexuality. But report everything to me."" He decided, ""fuck that. I'm not gonna respect her enough to follow the ONE rule she placed."""
82,This is possible for sure. Thank you. Sometimes I need to hear that I will be okay from someone on the outside. 
83,I would say the first step would be to go your manager. I think this will help your first worry of seeming like a troublemaker. Then go to HR and discuss your options. They do keep things confidential and will make sure in a good mindset before they move forward.
84,"Yeah but why on earth would he side with her if he's your friend? I'm sorry but that really isn't normal. Either he isn't really your friend as much as you think he is, or they're sleeping together. Nothing else makes sense. "
85,"&gt; And considering your married to him with children I'm guessing leaving him isn't an option.

I didn't realise we were in the 1930s."
86,I'm not religious but I admire your steadfastness to your faith. I hope it all works out for you. 
87,"Woah slow down there. Security cameras would be a huge red flag. I'd personally say that investing trust in each other and taking it slow would be more beneficial. Maybe once she moves in, everything is a-okay. Just let things be for few weeks or a month or so and then revisit the topic together. Keep in mind that this girl would probably be opposed to security cameras or anything like that too. Not because she does or doesn't wanna fuck BF, but because she wants her privacy too and maybe will wanna bring home a guy or her own BF to spend the night sometime, and security cameras will cause tension. Find ways to mutually encourage trust between you two. If BF doesn't want to cheat, then he won't. If she makes a move on him, it is his obligation to say no and to inform you of the situation. If he does have hidden intentions to do something, then that's his mistake and he will have to suffer those consequences. The latter seems HIGHLY unlikely since you both are using this account together. So I think your safest route is simply to let things be and keep honest communication WITHOUT breaching trust and privacy of yourselves or the girl. Don't be over zealous with ""security""; that ironically can make people insecure."
88,"Blake needs solid support, even if he doesn't tell you. He's probably very scared and unhappy because of all of the changes.  Do what you can to be a good role model for him, and it will pay dividends later in life.

89,Why would I do a different tattoo? I want this tattoo. 
90,How can you insult a labradoodle?!
91,"Why are you being so rude to him? I don't see him saying he wants his gf to change her plans for him. He's in a tough situation looking for advice, there's no need to be condescending and rude."
92,"A ten year age difference doesn't matter once people have been established adults.  Your gf is fresh out of high school, not an established adult.  Just because she reached the age of consent doesn't mean you should take advantage of that at your age.  Not just for her, but for you.  

Before, your friends thought you were just shy and awkward.  Now they know you're willing to stoop almost to the level of pedophilia with the difference being only 1 year of age.  No wonder they feel uncomfortable.  It makes you look like you have poor judgement and an outcast to people your own age, even if they're polite to your face.  Think of it this way, what if she were only a couple years younger and had a crush on you?  Would you take advantage of the opportunity just because you really liked her?  Or would you keep things strictly platonic, treating her more like a friend or kid sister?

You are too close to the edge here IMO."
93,"Yes, they are harming the girl. They're treating her as less of a person because she has two X chromosomes. That alone is bad enough, but what happens if op and his wife do have a son later? Cue the golden child/scapegoat dynamic. The poor kid could end up spending years in therapy undoing the damage that her grandparents did. And op's wife has been a horrible excuse for a mother. It's a parent's job to shield their child from this kind of abuse, not serve their vulnerable offspring up to their abusive clusterfuck of a family on a silver platter."
94,"While I'd usually say that your wife should be the one to speak up, it doesn't seem like she is entirely willing.  I think a big part of keeping your daughter protected is how you respond to their statements, especially when they are made within earshot of her.  If they suggest rituals to father a boy, make sure that your daughter hears that you love having a girl and wouldn't want to use a remedy like that.  If they make fun of you for taking care of her, make sure she hears that it's because you love spending time with her.  

Unfortunately, there are a lot of people like this out there - it's idiotically ingrained in our society.  I'm a woman with two sons and get the reverse - people pity me that I don't get to ""dress up"" a little girl, even though I think my two boys are great fun and wouldn't change them for anything.  All you can control is how you react to statements like that in the moment and ensure that your kids feel valued by you for the people that they are."
95,"Tell your 32 year old girlfriend to put on some big girl panties cause it's time to leave the nest.

I'd bet my bank account that she's likely still very dependent on her mother."
96,"I understand your cultural issues, and that you don't want to bring up the fact that you are dating until you are ready to be married.  My traditional Italian family used to be like that, so I get it.  I think that your compromise of doing Christmas with them and New Years with your BF is a good one.  

At some point, you are going to have to form a new family with your BF, and that means your family will have to adjust.  That is what happens when you pledge marriage to someone.  You can't have it both ways; all your family things *and* your BF and couple things.  You just can't, so now is a good time to learn to straighten your spine and set boundaries with your family.

When you get married, you both have to form your primary alliance with each other.  Your families, both, will have to accept and adjust.    If you put your family above your husband, you will not have a happy marriage.  Now is a good time to start practicing for that scenario by keeping the status quo from the last two years.  Acknowledge their feelings, and simply tell them that it makes you happy to spend NYE with friends, and that you hope they can be happy for you.  If they care about your feelings more than they care about controlling you, they will understand.  Good luck."
97,"&gt;So far the positives of our relationship have been enough to outweigh the drawbacks for me

To recap your OP and all your comments, your husband is very selfish, immature, emotionally stunted, and manipulative. To keep up with the Joneses, he is now withholding sex until you remove your IUD, so he can have his mini-me. You formerly desperately wanted children and spent a long time and a lot of emotional energy coming to terms that he didn't want children (which he concealed until day 2 of your honeymoon). Now that you realize you can't trust him to be an equal parent/partner due to all his bad qualities, you don't want a kid *with him* and are okay with him leaving you over this issue. 

What are his good qualities, again? Do you love him because of him or because it's been 10 years, and you're comfortable with him (Not bad enough to leave, but not good enough to be happy)?

I understand that your husband is all you've ever known (it sounds like you were pretty sheltered up until your wedding). I could be wrong, but it sounds like you want him to pull the plug on the relationship so it can be his fault that the marriage went south. I was once in a similar situation (9 years with my first boyfriend from age 18-27). I didn't want to leave him unless something truly bad happened (like physical abuse or cheating). He ended up cheating on me, and I left. You know what I felt? There was a lot of sadness, but underneath all that was a huge swell of relief. In hindsight, he was a very selfish asshole, and pretty much every man I dated since him has been at least 100X better. I am now engaged to a wonderful man, and I cringe when I think I could have just stuck to my ex and never known anything better. If I get sick, I trust my future husband to take care of me. When I get old, I know that he will stick by me and my wrinkly ass. He'll always have my back. Trust me, if your relationship is like my former one, whether you file or he does, it's not going to be your fault. Don't wait until you're old or sick for your husband to let you down."
98,"Lol yes, you are clearly so mature. Writing a post on Reddit whining about how a guy you started dating 2 months ago was on Tinder even though you two never had a conversation about being exclusive.

Then, to defend yourself, you start throwing out your academic credentials. I never called you stupid or uneducated. Your education has literally *nothing* to do with your common sense in a relationship. I give zero shits about your education because your post and my responses have nothing to do with academia. You're naive as hell in a romantic relationship. You could be Einstein levels of smart and still naive AF romantically.

You are proving how incredibly immature you are in every single one of your responses to anyone who hasn't agreed with you or validated you. To be honest, you sound like a brat. Grow up and get over yourself. Good luck."

If I don't cook, she'd insist on chinese takeout, chinese w/ broccoli 10 out of 10 times. She doesn't know how to cook or have the will to learn either

OP says this in a comment, so no, that's not true. While they currently don't live together, if the relationship progresses he's going to be affected by it for every meal at home and anytime out with her. He has to deal with a lot, and its only going to grow."

I dunno, it would bug me that it's either on or off, that he hasn't shown a balance between all that. And gis lie by omission is *really* working against giving him the benefit of the doubt. "

No, you cannot withhold rent. Even if your roommate was your landlord--it's unclear whether you're sub-letting from her or not--and you were in an area that allows rent withholding, her dog's actions don't constitute a breach of habitability. 

You can, however, take her to small claims court over the damage. You would not be able to sue for the entire value of the mattress, only the depreciated value--which, granted, would be very close to the entire value, given how new it is. And the fact that you've been sleeping on it would count as evidence that it's not as bad as you say it is.

I think the fact that her having sex with another man, sharing that level of intimacy with another person is damn right shameful. Also look at the lengths she went thru just to be with this other guy... driving drunk, lying to you and her friends, then hits the garage door. Once the trust is gone it could take even longer to get it back, if that ever happens, is it worth it to you? I'd say no and take that time to move on. "

He should have tried to help you feel young again together. He should have told you sooner if things were not the way he wanted. Why, just why, do people ruin their families when you two just as easily could have, I don't know, gone bowling or gotten a babysitter and then spent the night on the town, doing all that ""young people"" crap people romanticize so often?

Here if the deal: your ex is a fool and I have seen this situation play out and have even lived it to some degree. Actually, I was in a two year relationship with a guy 16 years older than me. It starts out exciting at first, and it's nice to be with someone who seems more mature than all the other guys. But then you realize it... it could take years but it will hit you like a ton of bricks: clearly if he WAS mature, he would not have risked ruining his marriage, torturing his children and disregarding all of his responsibilities to be be with you. And it shows in other ways too. And your friends are all uncomfortable because he is old enough to be everyone's dad...

Just, trust me... people will downvote me for saying this, but I completely believe that he will end up single again AND he will have lost his children to this pretty much doomed relationship. Having dated a man 16 years older than me for two years, I know personally how little hope there is that this new, exciting relationship will actually work out. 

So, downvotes be damned, I'd like to let you know that his day or reckoning will come eventually. And no, your children do **not** have to be nice to him when he comes crawling back. Your ex made his choice now. Your children are old enough to make their own choices too. Personally, I'd let the kids decide if they want to see his side of the family. They seem to be pretty good at making their own decisions. Have an honest talk with them about it and see how they feel. 

For the record, you seem like an incredibly strong woman. I admire you. Moving to a new country is hard--I lived in Korea for a year, actually, and it was so difficult. Life in a new country is tough enough, but you are also staying strong and raising your children in a new state? You are an AWESOME mother and totally admirable in my eyes. The ex's family is just jealous that they don't get to see the kids. **But that is NOT your fault.** If they like the kids so much, they should direct their anger instead at the man that ruined everything and put is lusts before his family. How about that?"
125,"Did you feel non-committal? No. You never wanted kids and never intended to have them. So, acting 'non-committal' was a lie. You were already committed to a course of action, staying child-free, yet you didn't tell him that. That's a lie."
126,"How about you imagine what you'd feel like, and imagine what you'd need if you were that miserable, and then do that for her.

Btw, you totally should get a kettle bell or medicine ball and strap it to your front for a few hours. Just to see what it's like. "
127,"He kind of shuts down with anything that has to do with her. So I know he won't exactly be calm, which is understandable. I decided that if I get them before I hear from him, I won't read them or do anything with them. I would like to talk with him first before doing anything damaging. "
128,"Exactly. Not wanting to spend money on a wedding, I get. Not being interested or placing value in a religious commitment, or the social construct of marriage, I also get. 

Treating your partner like they might try to rob you and take advantage of you... That I don't get. I'd simply dump someone I thought was capable of that. I really would."
129,"There is no way I would be okay with this, especially if it becomes A Rule. 

As for doing it for *his* safety... eh, I'm not buying it. It's for OP's peace of mind, which is very different.

130,you guys aren't going to make it without separate spaces unless she figures this out.  do you at least have a couch so on nights when she feels the need to bicycle her legs in bed (WTF?!) or is restless and getting up a lot she can at least go there so she has less chance of waking you up?  but she needs to do something because what's happening now isn't acceptable.  can you wear ear plugs to drown out the coughing if she's in a different area?
131,"The problem is that it's so difficult to talk to him. He often takes anything I say as an attack on him or an insult (i.e something like ""you look upset"" or ""you're acting cold towards me""). 

Me getting up and moving to the living room, I assume, showed him that I didn't like what he said and I think he just wants me to be this happy robot all of the time and/or it pointed out that he was being rude

145,"Piggybacking off of this...

I got the same vibe. I can't help but feel that these reasonable requests weren't exactly made in the nicest of tones. Personally I wouldn't be too enthused if someone asked me to do something in an irritated tone, even if they meant for it to be in that tone or not.

Now, I don't think the husband's response was in any way appropriate when I say that, but it's not unreasonable to expect a negative response to requests made in negative/irritable tones.

This is overall an issue of communication though. And I think one of the things to bring up when attempting to fix this situation is his tendency to blame her emotional state or hormonal imbalances. Instead, he should be saying something like the following:

""Sure, I don't mind doing 'X' for you, but you asked me in a tone I do not appreciate. Could you please frame your requests in a more neutral tone? I'm not asking you to be super happy about everything when asking me, just to be mindful of what tone you use."""

I'm really sorry.

To be frank, it sounds like the age disparity between you two is reflective of his immaturity. Now that you're in your mid/later 20's, you're more focused on taking the appropriate steps to reach goals like owning property, getting married, and having kids. Now things that weren't an issue for you when you were younger are becoming more of an issue. You're growing and developing as an adult woman while he's largely stagnating, so the maturity gap between you two is widening more and more with each passing year."

From the sound of it, you never really had a conversation with him about this stuff other than making little passive comments. The prenuptial agreement was even your idea (when you thought you had more than him). 

I feel like this is going to make you look greedy, because your whole ""trust"" argument is pretty invalid. Look at it from his shoes. You wanted a prenup when you thought you had more, and then suddenly storm off when you find out that now he's the one being protected from it."

If mom and dad do say yes which i highly doubt they will without knowing the family any better than this post, the logistics could be a nightmare. OP wouldnt be legal guardian of her brother so putting him into school without the parents being involved would/could be a pain.

I think laying it out like it seems like you guys need help because W is suck a hassle or Z is always a turd would be the best bet. Make it seem like your offering them help and bro a opportunity to have a better bedroom and be able to play basketball and get help with homework, then follow through on those things. Im not sure what the legal age is to be emancipated or if it even varies by state but that is a option for T later down the line as well and with your support could be a potential future problem solver if mom and dad dont like their kid being away.

Personally id avoid legal advice 100% and talk to a actual lawyer if your going to do anything involving legal processes. With the parents okay this is perfectly fine arrangement. Though like i said already (and depending on location) it seems theres some distance between you and your parents and the logistics of getting him into school without some kind of legal permission to do so could be a huge set back in all of your plans.

My first step would be talk to your parents OP. If they are on board awesome, go from there first by making sure bro goes with you and then once hes there then work on the getting him into school and all that. If they are no on board then talk to a lawyer, consultations are usually free for so long. I dont think youll have much luck with a lawyer unless bro is old enough for emancipation which is possibly a large can of worms youd be getting your brother and yourself into depending on how well your parents took him legally separating himself from them.

FYI im not a lawyer, but i do have experience with emancipation in my state as well as living on your own at a young age."

182,"I read in one of your other comments that he makes 3x as much as you and ""mostly supports you"".  How did that dynamic come about?  When you two decided to move in together, did he want to live in a certain place that was above your means (to pay half) or was it always the understanding that you would pay commensurate with your respective salaries based on %, rather than 50-50?

I'm just guessing, but it sounds like there is some latent resentment (which is becoming not-so-latent) where he is devaluing you as an equal partner in the relationship based on the lesser value you contribute to shared expense.  He needs to learn how to separate the two.

If the above is correct, it would explain why you're working yourself to the bone to try and keep up.  Ultimately, the better plan is to discuss this issue and find out if he can learn to treat you as an equal, regardless of what you bring in or if he will always behave this way.

Some people equate a *person's* value with their income.  They also think if you don't earn as much you didn't work as hard.  My Dad had a saying that there's two kinds of people in this word:  Those that work hard and make a lot of money and those that work hard and don't.  Obviously, that's not entirely true, but as it relates to this discussion your boyfriend has to allow for the possibility that someone can work hard at a job they love but that particular profession does not earn as much.  He needs to expand his thinking.

For your part, you need to consider whether you're living above your means or if there is a better way of going about this than working two jobs and your entire summer and then feeling this overwhelmed or negative.  That sort of negativity DOES bleed out and can wear our a partner, even if everything else was fixed in your relationship."

The first might be to discuss splitting the bills with her as a percentage of your salaries, instead of 50-50. Since she makes 30% of what you make, she can pay 30% of the bills. Maybe that could work. 

Another thing to try might be to explain it this way. That you have worked very hard for the salary you have, and that part of that hard work is that you really want to be able to ENJOY it with the person you love. The reason you work so hard is to be able to afford fun trips. And you don't want to go alone, that's no fun. You WANT to go with her. And you know that it's not in her budget, and you're fine with that, you are willing to pay for both of you, because it's not a hardship for you, and because YOU want to travel with the person you love, and enjoy these experiences. 

She thinks it's some magnanimous gift to her, but it's not. It's you, asking for a gift FROM her. You work hard for your money so you can enjoy it in the company of the person you love. You would like the gift of her company, so you can enjoy your vacations. She is doing you a FAVOR by joining you. 

That is how I would approach it. "
186,"Then why not just invite them? If they aren't going to show up or cause drama, then I don't see the harm in sending them an invite to make his parents happy.

*NOTE: I am not suggesting at all that you bend to the whim of his parents on everything wedding related. This just seems like something you can go along with that will have fairly low impact on your wedding. Voicing your dissent, but then acquiescing to their request can give you grounds later to say no to some other more impact-heavy requests. "
187,"I've lied before to people trying to push me into spending money that I can't afford. Example, ""I literally spent my very last 5 dollars on lunch today. So even 'just' 10 dollars is too high."" Who's going to be the jerk that tries to call you on that? "

Why would he question what his wife told him the expense was? Up until this reveal he had no reason to question her."
192,"Even factoring in the taxes you have to save every week you're making $2800 a month which leaves you about $1000 a month for groceries, utilities, clothes and necessities, savings etc. I'm not sure why you think you can't afford this. "
193,"What do you base that on? We haven't seen every moment of OP's life unfold to know that he's been 100% honest with his wife from the start of meeting her. This is a total stranger who is telling us the bare minimum details on an issue we never saw firsthand. 

If his wife is hiding money from him then all we know is that something in his marriage is wrong. 

We have no real clue what that is based on this small amount of information. She could be a total skeeze who uses the money to buy hookers and blow. He could be an abusive butt who doesn't like it when she's out of the house for any reason. 

Or they could both just be average people who have a problem caused by her guilt at staying home combined with her natural need to feel some control over finances that has then turned into lies and deception. Who knows! We don't.

-
On the general topic of lies, the lie could be as simple as saying you like someone's sweater vest when you actually hate it. 

People are filled with lies, it's how we navigate society without having or causing emotional breakdowns every other hour. 

""Honest"" people will lie less often, tell lies that are meant to spare feelings more than get away with something, and will feel guilty for lying when they do it. They'll strive not to lie, but it's actually very hard to do without also going mute. 

Try living a full day without saying one lie, you may find that you don't even get to use the normal hallway greetings at work because you probably aren't actually having a great day. 

How odd would it be if you started saying, ""Hello, yes, I am having a mediocre day due to intense gas pains and the lingering sense of my own fleeting mortality. And you?"""

196,"And being a parent also means setting limits for your kids and dealing with their frustration/anger/outbursts so they can later live their life better (i.e. learn to limit oneself, deal with limits in relationships, the workplace, etc). I would as such add that the husband should examine why he is uncomfortable setting this limit, if it is something recurrent in his parenting and if so, how he is negatively impacting the development of his kid."
197,"&gt; because he goes into a daze when trying to finish.

He needs to figure out a better way to finish with a partner. You're not a masturbation sleeve-you're a person. If he needs hard, rough, fast sensations to finish, he may be employing the death grip when he masturbates. If so, he needs to just go without orgasm until he can come from softer, gentler sensations. If he retrains his dick to come from the softer sensations of sex with you that *you* can enjoy, all the better."
198,"I think your boss meant that you pay for it yourself when you get fingerprinted (at the place with your money) then you get reimbursed later by the business.

They have a very strong attachment to the idea that you have a uniquely permanent bond with your genetic family, and that you can't create a relationship of equal value by choice. It seems like they think it would somehow be a waste or a bad ROI to put the work of parenting into a child who didn't have that special biological tie to them. It's weird to me because I'm not close to my biological relatives at all, and there are several people I'd take a bullet for that aren't related to me. "

And dogs get stressed easily and can be territorial.  I'm shocked that there hasn't been a dog fight or one of the kids hasn't been bitten yet.

211,"Well, step one is taking your child to a doctor to make sure she's physically okay. 

Step two is reporting the molestation to the police; if he has a computer or laptop, there is probably child porn on it.

I know it seems overwhelming and terrible, and it is, but this isn't something that will stop or go away if you wait. You need to protect your daughter right now. "
212,"Yeah, she was picking fights because she doesn't know how to just.. let someone love her without drama. The drama of an abusive relationship can be addicting and it's tough to stop that cycle, you get used to the toxic environment and freak out in a healthy one. "

221,"&gt; It sounds like stripping wasn't all she did.

And? It doesn't change what I said at all.

&gt; Aside from that, she's literally lied to OP for years (and had no intention of talking about it) and then tried to steamroll all of his attempts to talk about it.

""Literally"" lied? It's not like OP asked and his wife said no. Not everyone has the strength to talk about especially embarrassing or traumatic events of their past, and she's not doing it right now behind his back. It wasn't hidden out of malice, which is completely different than hiding, say, an affair.

She also just got jumped by this, I think it's understandable that they both reacted poorly under sudden stress. 

&gt; She's also not being threatened at all? The documentary crew has made no attempts to do anything to her besides ask if she'd like to be in the film and then leave her alone when she said no.

Former strippers, prostitutes, and porn stars who move on to new jobs often lose their new jobs once their new employers find out, not to mention losing friends and family, and clearly OP's wife's history is not as buried as she thought it was. The documentary crew doesn't seem like they're being very cautious if they're knocking on strangers' doors and giving out info in front of others."

230,"&gt;so I can see where I present as single.

You are openly flirting and showing interest in him without mentioning you have a boyfriend. So, yeah, I can see why he assumes you are single. Time to tell him you aren't."
231,"Best advice I can give you as someone who as been through a 'trial break' or two (both of which were breakups btw), is to take some of her words to heart.  Not all of them.  Some of what she said hit your insecurities because she knew how to drive the nail in, some hit your insecurities because they are things that are worth working on.  It is up to you in the future to take how she broke up with you as a gift and make yourself better for the next girl.  

As to this one, you arn't going to change in two weeks while morning the loss of your relationship at the same time.  It is just not going to happen.  Structural changes take weeks to decide to take on a habit, and months or years to set it in stone.  

Here is the thing.  The partner you want is one who loves you and will stand by your side through thick and thin.  She isn't that, thats what she told you when she asked for a break.  Maybe your faults in her eye are reasonable, maybe she is asking for what she will never find.  It doesn't matter, for how you approach.  If you come back together she has to earn your trust back as a loving partner as much as you have to fix your faults.  That is important, **do not** beg borrow and steal to get back into this relationship.  If it is something you both want you will both fight for it, if its something only you want, only you will fight for it and it will be a shit show.

If you find value in her requests don't pretend you have changed in 2 weeks.  You haven't.  Make a list; these are the issues you brought up that resonated with me, these are the ways I am working on them.  Discrete ways, not 'I'll change baby, I promise':

&gt;  ""You spend too much time at work"":""I have told my boss that I will work under 50 hours a week in the next month, I have started to look for a new job assuming that will not happen.""  

&gt;""You don't communicate with me, then blow up out of nowhere"": ""I have bought books A and B.  I have also found therapist C who says they will talk to me about the issue.

Whatever it is, if you believe that she is right that you have a failing fix it.  Even if she doesn't come back.  Fix it.  You will find a better women in the end."
232,"A 6-hour phone call??? This is not normal at all, and on top they text each other everyday as well?

Plus you have no idea what she is up to during the day as she doesn't work. And how convenient that video editing is so time consuming.


I'd be very, very wary of what's going on. You have plenty of reasons to be suspicious, but now you either talk to her about it or you break up, things can't just continue like this.


So yes, your feelings of distrust are perfectly valid.
"
233,"From Captain Awkward the ultimate guide to breaking up. Unfortunately, there’s no way to break up with this person that won’t make him sad or hurt his feelings. What he wants (you) and what you want (not to be with him) are incompatible, and you can’t really control how he’ll feel about it or how he’ll react or whether he’ll sort himself out in the end. All you can control is your own behavior.

So, how can you be as kind as you can possibly be when initiating a breakup, especially of a pretty short relationship like this one?

Own the decision completely: “My feelings have changed…” “I have decided to end this…”
Reasons are overrated. If they ask you to tell them the reasons or start suggesting reasons, proceed with caution! The least awkward way to deal with stuff like“Tell me what I did wrong so I can improve,” “You don’t love me because (of thing I hate about myself)!” “You’re really in love with Mystery Other Person, I knew it!” might be to disengage from the specifics of what they say in favor of something like “I’m so sorry, I know this was all really upsetting for you to hear, and I really don’t know what else to say except that I know that ending this is the right decision for me.“
Be clear and direct about what is happening: “I want to end our relationship” not a vague “I need some space” or “I’m thinking about breaking up” that keeps the person hanging on thinking that there’s still a chance.
You don’t have to be friends. You don’t have to be friends even if you kinda got pressured into reassuring the really sad person you just dumped that of course you would be friends in order to end the conversation, or if you thought you wanted to be friends but you changed your mind later.”I’d love to be friendly someday, but right now it’s too hard/it doesn’t feel right and I need a clean break.“
Don’t say “You’ll find someone” or “I don’t deserve you.” In the first case, you don’t know that. In the second case, it’s shitty to turn the moment when you’re dumping someone into a thing where now they have to reassure you that you DO in fact deserve them!
Plan how you’re going to actually leave the conversation. Are you going to go to a friend’s house right after, or break up in a quiet but semi-public place that’s easy for everyone to leave? If you’re able, I encourage you to do some planning so you’re not in the position of having to urge or kick someone out of your living space after you break their heart.
Other logistics can (often) wait. If the person tries to immediately and clumsily initiate The Returning Of The Stuff during the breakup conversation, in many cases it’s okay to say, “Hey, don’t worry about it right now. Tomorrow I can drop off (stuff of theirs that you have) and pick up (stuff of yours that they have).” Or make arrangements to use the Postal Service or Mutual Friend Courier Service Or Whatever. There are always exceptions to this, of course, like if you really are trying to never see this person again and need to take self- or expensive stuff-protective action, but if you generally trust everyone to behave themselves in my experience this might be best handled separately."

235,I'm not knocking anyone's personal choice but I've always thought the same. I can't imagine anyone having a normal sexual relationship after marriage when they've literally never done it before. The whole point of sex before marriage is to find out what you like and whom you're compatible with... I don't see why people think a piece of paper or a wedding will make anyone suddenly be OK with sexual feelings after denying them for so long. 
236,No way. I feel like he would have to be bathing in it for you to smell it as strongly. Especially if his room smells of it strongly enough to rub off on you. Unless he is dealing coke out of his room I highly doubt you would smell it as strongly as you describe.

238,"she wouldn't be. There's a whole TEAM of nurses and doctors, with MUCH more experience than you.  She did not want, or need you.  Your time to negotiate for space in the delivery room was the preceding 9 months.  You failed to make this happen. showing up during labor was dumb, and rude."

244,"Hi OP, I'm half Thai (born in America) and went through something very similar with my gramps before he passed. Gramps was always kind of a weird dude, drank vodka like water, smoked constantly, was just kind of a 'take no shit' hard ass. Everyone just let him do his own thing when he was healthy, but when he got older and in ill health we all took turns visiting him.

Welp, mom and I go over (I'm about 22) and gramps and I are sitting at the table, mom gets up to help the caregiver with drinks. I look over at gramps, ready to start a convo and dude is literally drooling, staring right at my chest, hand out about 6"" from my chest. I WTF'D so hard. Immediately stood up, walked outside. Didn't know what to do.

I talked with my mom about it when we left. I didn't bring it up while we were still visiting as gramps was in Thailand and we see him about every other year, I didn't want to be rude. I was made to awkwardly hug and kiss him, in which I had to nearly snap my own neck off to avoid a full lip lock kiss (NOT how my family rolls, this is NOT typical).

Mom confirmed other female cousins had been told by my aunts and uncles to not go alone, gramps was turning into some senile perv, which apparently he was pretty decent covering up prior to old age eating at his willpower to not grab females.

OP, please tell your parents. It doesn't need to be a scary thought, it's simply ""hey guys, this happened. It makes me feel uncomfortable and I don't want it to happen again"", they're your parents and love you. You never know, they might already know of 'grandpas preclusion' and you're experiencing something they're aware of.

253,"As someone with Aspergers: this, OP! 

Autistic people typically get on better with those both above and below their own age groups - just rarely their age peers. Aside from which, whilst Aspies and Auties might not pick up social clues all that easily, one of the easiest ones you start to notice is when someone doesn't like you or finds you annoying or wishes you would Just Shut Up, because it's one of the most regular signs you see. In other words, being forced into friendships hurts all parties. 

A better route to getting him to socialise might be looking at clubs or activities where he can be part of a group, and interact with others, without the sole focus of the interaction being 'friendship'. 

A good option is amateur dramatics - I joined a local theatrical group when I was younger, and discovered that being on stage was like home to me; whilst everyone else had to put on a character, I felt more like I was taking one off. Real life is an awful lot of improvising to me, and to learn to interact better in real life through studying a script is an immensely useful life skill.  "

I became a mini-him, sort of, and thought I was above everybody and better than everybody for some imaginary reason that I never really bothered to look into too much. In school I ended up a recluse, I didn't understand social norms because to me norms were mean jokes and snide remarks but I didn't understand that that would just get me alienated so I ended up naturally quiet as years went on. Then for my junior and senior year in high school, I went to a technical school and actually started to make friends. 

I watched and listened and by the time I was finished with high school it was all flipped. I could see why my dad was alone, why he never had anyone that stuck around longer than a few years in his relationships, and why he was avoided by people who really knew him. He was and still is toxic, plain and simple, and is a generally awful person. He is a chore to deal with and a headache to be around. Example: He doesn't believe anything about what happened with Bill Cosby because people like him 'just don't do that'. He makes horrible comments about things like that, supports the 'grab her by the pussy' stuff because he himself says similar things, and just overall is an ass. He has a complete god complex where he thinks he has all of the answers to anything everywhere, no matter how little he understands the actual problem. He is adamant that the woman who all came forward with the Cosby stuff are lying because those sort of things 'just don't happen'. He is just illogical and out of touch with reality, and he will disregard any factual evidence he doesn't agree with no matter how obvious it is that he's wrong.

He attempted to raise me to be just like him, and to copy all of the arrogance, entitlement and asshattery that he dispenses on a daily basis. What he tried to make me think was reality was really just his warped version where everyone is out to get you and you have to do whatever it takes to come out on top and be better than everyone else. It's taken a long time, but I've come a long way and am now stopping my self on a regular basis to take a step back and evaluate everything that's going on. More often than not I find that I am in fact doing good nowadays where as when I was a child and young teen I was indeed a generally awful person. He taught me to be one, and at that age I didn't know any better but I grew up and learned. 

To answer that last question, what was my childhood like as a golden child? Well, it actually wasn't that bad, at least not at the time. I didn't understand what was happening, even if I thought I did, and I never understood what my mom was talking about when she would get mad about 'you coming home from your dads and acting like that'. I was my dads spoiled princess until I grew up and because my own person, and then I was someone he didn't like. Nowadays I honestly have tried to forget a lot of my childhood because some of the things he did, in retrospect, are horrible and were nothing more than him trying to show me who was in control. 

If he had his way I would be 'ladylike', in which I would sit quietly in a corner and go silent until spoken to unless I have something to say that puts him in a good light. I would still be living with him, walking all the way across the house to get him a pop from his mini-fridge five feet away because it is too far out of reach from his recliner and he doesn't want to get up.  I would still be going into the grocery store with his money as I've done since I was a little kid to get groceries all by myself while he sits in his truck because he can't be bothered to walk around. I would still be sitting in my room, surrounded by four prison walls and all of the material bullshit I could want while waiting for him to yell for me so that it's showtime and he gets to show off his perfect daughter who is completely under his thumb. I would still be crying myself to sleep, not understanding why I felt so depressed and useless all the time and why I feel so unloved and unwanted and not understanding that he would just never be the parent I wanted him to be no matter how much I jumped when he says jump. He is incapable, because it's the behavior that he learned from his father and to him it is behavior that is normal and it is expected that I also see it as normal or I am in the wrong. My childhood was great, it was my early teen years when everything took a turn and if it wasn't for my boyfriend encouraging me to move out at 19 I'm not even sure if I would be alive today because there were many times that I fantasized how much easier it would be for it all to end than to go on being a puppet in his play. 

This got a bit more rambly and jumbled than I intended, any questions?

269,"This isn't something every family can do.  My mom's family reunion involves people coming in from Florida, Texas, northern Indiana and Kentucky.  The reunion is literally the only day of the year where everyone can get together and see each other."
270,"&gt; However, what it does mean is that she will not be sitting watching TV and think ""I should probably do [chore]"". It will not occur to her to tidy up mess when she sees it the way it does for you. She will likely not notice the mess until it's relevant to something

Holy shit... years of trying to explain this to my family and my ex and you worded it perfectly.  

I also want to add, when you do realize it and realize it is now a huge undertaking to clean, you are filled with an incredible amount of anxiety because of 2 reasons... 1 you are convinced you will never get the mess under control and 2 no matter how much effort you put into it all it takes is a week for things to go back to the way they were and they are unmanageable again.

Its a vicious cycle.

274,"You've stated that this man antagonizes you and makes you feel like he expects you to reflect his moods to his satisfaction. If you don't expect to have to act like a robot and he has already gotten you into this corner, I'm afraid it's hard to see a way out or a way to improve the situation. You're essentially asking that he treat you like a real human being, which he can only choose to do himself. He already has a crazy amount of power over you and he's not going to all the sudden realize that acting that way is wrong and just stop doing it.... he gets so much out of acting this way that he's not going to change without major disruptions to your relationship. He's already got you babysitting/parenting his daughter and working two jobs while he sits on his ass, and you don't even have a marriage certificate!"
275,"They both have equal control over whether or not the relationship will continue. Either can break up with the other. She has control over her education and career and future life plans, sure, but that's as it should be, just as he has control of his. If he feels her life plans are incompatible with his, the way to ""control"" that is for him to break up with her, not to try and coerce or pressure her to fit into his plans."
276,"There probably is some sort of pattern, but as I've stated, there's nothing that says she's doing this on purpose. And having a headache may be her way of stating that she's just not in the mood that day. And if you come home late, she's probably tired and wants to go to sleep. And geez, are you supposed to have sex every day like rabbits or something?  

Anyways, keeping score is really bad for relationships, so I suggest you stop doing it."
277,"If your partners says, ""I'm not comfortable with so-and-so being in your wedding party"", that should be respected, not merely reconsidered. A wedding is for two people, so yes, both people absolutely have a say in who will be in the wedding parties and have the right to ""veto"" a person.

There's no reason to jump from not wanting a certain person in the wedding parties to cancelling the whole wedding, unless you're prone to dramatics."
278,"You be an adult, and tell her that she can't come. It's not that hard."
279,It's indicative of a very possible bigger problem.

282,"I am pretty sure that was his source, (which from my understanding probably isn't the full truth), and he misunderstood what he read or heard from someone who did.

Sex ed is a travesty. I'm not saying squirting needs to be a topic, (although I do think it should be taught), but thinking that when a woman ""gets wet"" that it's pee, is like what you'd expect from a 9 year old. Not a young, educated, sexually active, man from a first world country."
283,"I think your reaction was expected when being in such a tense situation. 

However, your number one priority should be your fiancee. Check on her and see how she is. Whatever she wants, take care of her and make sure she gets it. Once the situation has calmed down, talk to her and see what action she wants to take. Ultimately, this is her father and she can decide what she wants to do. Be there to support her no matter what it is."
284,"How well do you know Lisa? Are you and she close friends? How much time has she spent in your home? Are you, perhaps, uncomfortable with her hanging out there? Are you uncomfortable with the fact that you would would have to engage more with her than you have in the past? These are legitimate objections. 

I don't know why other posters are acting like you're insane for objecting to this woman as babysitter. Just because you're okay with her having a friendship with your husband, it doesn't mean you want her spending time with you, with your children, in your home, touching your things, etc."

289,"It seems like his issue is less what she eats and more that he has to always do the same thing. In a comment, he says 

&gt; We don't live together yet so I don't always have an issue with this as I can enjoy myself when we're apart. We go out twice a week and I do all the cooking if we stay in. When I do cook, its always simple boring things per her liking: Rice, chicken or salmon with a vegetable side.
If I don't cook, she'd insist on chinese takeout, chinese w/ broccoli 10 out of 10 times. She doesn't know how to cook or have the will to learn either

While OP focuses on the eating out aspect in his post, I think the bigger issue here is that they don't seem very compatible to live together. He doesn't seem to have any issues with her allergies, but rather how picky she is about everything else.  Having to cook her one of a few meals or eat chinese takeout every time is understandably not fun, and will only get worse if their relationship progresses and they move in together. Your situation is different. 

"
290,"Good for you. It takes a strong, dedicated person to have fleeting moments of polite behavior. "
291,"Jesus dude. I'm a lady and she has been abusively neglecting and taking you for granted. 

I feel like after all I read, I doubt bringing this all up with her will even register... she generally seems entitled and consciously spoiled. She's a brat.

Since I can't question her, I'll question you.

Why would you let this behavior become normal and accepted? You essentially showed her that it's okay for her to treat you like her slave. 

Where to start... I don't know, point out her hypocrisy in a gentle way where you use ""I"" statements.

""I feel like I'm not appreciated, and it hurts my feelings."" 

""I feel exhausted, I feel like I have no Me time, I feel sexually unfulfilled when I don't get what I give.""

Then say you are unhappy in this agreement and you want to reevaluate it with her. If she refuses.... if she doesn't refuse, therapy. Couples counseling. 

I can't imagine you are happy."
292,"Get a lock for your room if you have one or get a safe place to store your things if not. Keep an online (private) diary describing your day and include any interactions you have with your sister, positive or negative. This helps you have a record for anything that she might say and goes a little further than just your memory. 
For example, if your sister says she was throwing up on Tuesday, you can look back and read that you had actually taken her to the library and she spent the rest of day appearing healthy. 
It can also help you keep your peace of mind if she starts trying to make you doubt your own memory. All of this is premature but I think these are important steps. Secure your belongings and keep an account of your time. "
293,"This is making me think it's way more common in your SOs family than he's aware of, could this be how they do big dinners?"

295,"Automatic inheritance of each other's property without tax or probate.

The right to make next of kin medical decisions in the event of the incapacitation of your spouse.

The right to receive your spouse's body for burial/cremation.

Being able to adopt children together.

The opportunity to be on your spouses health, dental, vision insurance plans.

Getting married is also a *qualifying life event* that permits initiating insurance coverage outside of open enrollment periods. 

Spouses can apply for credit jointly.

The right to visit an incarcerated spouse. This may include conjugal visit.

Members of the military receive additional benefits for dependants. A spouse is a dependant in the eyes of the government, a  life partner is not. Some of these benefits

-  The right to be moved at government cost to your spouses new duty station.

- The right to be considered for base housing.

-  military dependant medical insurance  (Champus)

-  the right to interact with your spouses command via the comand ombudsman (the ombudsman knew our ship's schedule before any of the sailors aboard knew)

I could keep going.

But you get the idea.

Marriage is embedded in everything. It is the assumed path for initiating a whole host of other life events. The reverse assumption is that if you can't bother to marry, then the 1000 or so benefits that accrue to married people must not matter much to you.

And if you truly believe you cannot make friends, therapy will help."
299,Yes that probably would be inappropriate seeing as a 6 year old doesn't understand boundaries and most of their bad behaviors are the result of the boyfriend's poor parenting. 
300,Then your experience with it is biased and you're associating it with other crazy behaviors of hers. Personally it wouldn't bother me if my BF looked my Ex and all.

Also, if she enjoys math there are a few math fields besides pure math that she could consider. There's engineering, which was touched on by previous commenters, but there's also the financial fields - actuarial, accounting, financial analysis etc. Those fields may really interest her. "
304,"Uh, congrats, I guess?  Your post is really all over the place.  You apologized to her (for what?), you acknowledge she never feels sorry for her behavior, go on for a bit about her mental disorders, and you think telling someone to stop guilting you is unhealthy?  It's like a different person is writing this update compared to the original from yesterday.  If you're happy with the outcome, though, then that's great."
305,"""I'm hurt that you immediately told me to change it back. This is a change I've wanted for a while, and while I can understand you don't like it, it's just hair. It will grow out and get cut eventually. Your behavior and comments and threats to break up are hurtful because I thought I meant more to you than just hair.""

I'd go with something like this if you don't want to just go straight to breakup. Don't apologize, because you've got nothing to apologize for."
306,Then maybe they are all better off without them anyway.
307,"The post is about her mother body shaming her, and like it or not, boobs are a part of her body.  Her mother refusing to let her get fitted for a bra growing up is also all kinds of not cool. If it provides insight to the relationship, it's relevant. "

...Okay, I don't know why more than half of this story is about T.  This is not about T.  T is a jerk.  He'd be a jerk even if your sister hadn't died, or they'd never broken up.  But you seem to have *major* difficulty dealing with grief or other unwelcome emotions in a constructive way even without that loss, and you really, *really* need to find a grief counselor or some other therapist to talk that out with.  That's what they're there for."
310,mmm-If he is not wearing the my guess is he doesn't really want to.  Try not giving him clothes and then see if he asks for them.
311,"So, you left your department without informing your superior and she held you to the rules that were set. And then you broke another rule, because you were upset that your wife is treating you like an employee at work...where you are her employee. 

And to make it sound better, you've decided to go with the ""I won't respect anyone in management"" teenage sounding angst route rather than admitting you messed up.

Sound about right? Or is this because you thought you deserved to get promoted more than she did? Obviously, she deserves respect at the job, because *she was the one chosen to be promoted over everyone else.* Because I can see no other reason to be as childishly passive aggressive as you are being. 

If you can't handle it, transfer departments. It is weird for a company to have a husband and wife working together in the same department. 

(Note: I am not a fan of the public shaming rule, but being bent out of shape that you can't smoke whenever you want *at your job* is pretty much a you problem). "
312,"You don't want to marry her because you see her as a financial ""risk"". That seems to be your only reason.

I'm not in Canada, so I don't know the legality, but you should look into it. Are there no pre-nups that you can sign? Especially if you have the job before marrying her (which you should)? You say that common law exists...are there provisions for alimony if you live with a partner for a certain number of years? You should be talking about finances and what ifs.


There are benefits to marriage. She's right about the socially. Not at 24 after dating for 2 years, but at 34, after dating for 12, at 54 after dating for 32, it's hard to say ""boyfriend"". It does seem like it's lacking something. Also the emotional...I'd be upset if my partner didn't want to make a binding commitment.  Especially when your reasoning is that she's a financial risk.


Have you looked into the difference in taxes, filing joint vs separate  (I know nothing about Canada). What about legal rights after death. Medical decisions. Being able to visit each other in the hospital? 


It's okay to not want to get married, but the fact that you see her as a financial risk makes you seem like an ass."
313,"&gt;one justified it as saying it was meaningless to him yet she would get worked up about it so not worth the drama.

This logic tho. 
I guess I could say the same about grinding on someone at a club or making out at a bar. "
314,"There's a big risk to buying a place together when you aren't married.

If you're married, you own a house together, and then separate or divorce, the courts help determine how the split of the house and other marital assets will be handled.

If you aren't married, you own a house together, and the relationship ends, you are on your own in figuring out how to handle the house.  If one person wants to sell the house and the other refuses to sell AND can't afford to buy their former partner's share, what can be done?  Not much, and it's likely to get expensive.  Or what if one partner just leaves and the other can't afford the house on their own?

I saw this happen with a coworker who had bought a house with a friend of his.  Both guys were single and wanted the benefits of home ownership.  They co-owned happily for years.  Then, the friend fell in love and wanted to sell his interest in the house so he could get married and move away.  My coworker had to really scrape to get approved for a mortgage he could just barely afford just to keep his house.  Otherwise, he would have needed to sell the whole house and start looking for new housing.

If your BF wants to buy a house, and he can afford to do so, he csn buy the house.  You could live with him and pay him rent in sn amount the two of you agree upon.  You would not be responsible for maintenance costs but you also wouldn't earn equity.  And there would be no question of who would move out if the relationship ended."
315,"It's your body, he doesn't get a say in what you put on it. "
316,Ether is the smell you all are trying to put your finger on. Cocaine is made with ether. 
317,He told her to either have an abortion or he would leave her and have nothing to do with the child. I'm sure she felt a lot of pain and resentment too. 
318,Show her this post op. She needs a come-to-jesus moment from a good friend. 
319,That's a very shitty and selfish thing for him to threaten you with. 
320,"But what is the difference betw. ""permanently ill"" and ""childish and petulant""? Is he really ill? I think maybe he's just selfish and immature. Hopefully he isn't a full-blown narcissist. And if he is, that is a disorder that I don't think current psychiatry can fix. If he's just selfish and childish, her dumping him might teach him a valuable lesson. 

Even having a mental illness doesn't get you off the hook from supporting your spouse. I was dangerously depressed and mourning the death of my toxic mother when my husband's brother died. I had to suck it up in the depths of my distress and look after his needs to the extent I could. "
321,"As this behaviour is very different to how he was when you were first together, my first thought is depression and anxiety. He's so anxious you'll try to make him do stuff he's not comfortable with, that he's almost willing to risk ruining your relationship rather than try to change anything.

Are you close to his family? If so, maybe seek out the advice of one or two people (sisters, brothers?) to see if there's anything you're not aware of that might be behind this. 

What did he say when you implied this might be a permanent dealbreaker for you?"
322,"Nah, I think when you're close to someone you get to know their mannerisms well enough that you can at least subconciously tell when that person is lying to you. I've never snopped but I caught my ex lying a few times, and each time I had a strong gut feeling that something was off with him. Unless she makes a habit of snooping in relationships I wouldn't see any reason for her to feel guilty or like there's something wrong with her, she was just going on instinct, and it's a good thing she did because if she hadn't he would have continued to lie and take advantage of her trust. When you lie to a person's face about something that serious you really can't complain if they can tell that it's a lie and decide to check up on you. Now if he hadn't been lying, totally different story, I could see broken trust and insecurity issues as a problem. But if catching her boyfriend in one obvious lie is the worst thing she's done, I think she's safe to skip the therapy session. "
323,"How is he going to reinforce it though? Genuine question here. He's of same or similar age to the stepbrothers. 

I would recommend getting dashcam and get it recording the inside of the car, in case they sat bs to the parents. "
324,"If she's a close enough friend to turn to you for emotional support, how is it that she doesn't know you have a girlfriend?  To your girlfriend it probably sounds like you have hidden your relationship to get closer to Amanda.  At the point you are lying about something like this, it's a problem.  "
325,"So much of this. You are not taking this opportunity from this woman by applying for the job, because she is not entitled to the job (nor are you) - it's up to the hiring manager to pick the best candidate."
326,"My dad once told me I was funny, and I said thanks thinking he was actually being nice. Then he goes, ""yeah but looks aren't everything"" 😒😒😒"
327,"Apparently it's not.

And I would never assume exclusivity if it was only implied. If it appears so, I straight up ask and make sure we're on the same page. I would never assume something like that and I would expect the same from guys I'm seeing."
328,"You really shouldn't have made Draven admin. Deleting the channels (and whatever else he did) did absolutely nothing to protect anyone and just made a mess of things.

329,Maybe it's actually you're fault that you're accepting gifts from people that give you them under the impression that you are single? Who does that?
330,So you got her number and went out to lunch and text all the time.  No shit she's upset.
331,"Girl, you're 21. You've probably had very little experience yourself, so quit with the obnoxious comments. 


The poster didn't call you naive and trashy. They're saying the job is trashy and to jump at it is naive, both of which are true. Go for it if you want because it's your body and your decision and more power to anyone who can make money from their body. But there's no need to insult people. "
332,It reduces women to their sex organs and doesn't distinguish them from animals. All the other nouns you used as examples wouldn't be used to describe a dog. It's been considered dehumanizing since at least the early 1900s.

334,"&gt; Many people will probably tell you this in the next days - ""You're lucky you weren't married or with kids"". It was really pissing me off during my breakup. But it is true.

Hahah this made me laugh, cheers for that. I'm sure you're right and it'll come... as you say, it is true though!"

337,Who cleaned up the mess?
338,"This.  I started dating someone that I had a five year age difference with when I was 16 (he was 21, but a shy/inexperienced and I must say very sweet and kind 21).  We broke up by the time I was 20 because I changed so much and was finding my footing in life, becoming more outspoken and independent, whereas the person I was when we fell in love was much more reserved and quiet and in step with the kind of partner he needed as someone who was more of a homebody.  I wanted to travel a lot, for example, and did a semester in Europe.  The relationship couldn't survive that."
339,"&gt; It does seem like a bullshit excuse, but it's not just an easy out, it's honestly how I feel. When I'm alone, I try to fantasize about him, or even men in general, and it's just not enough for me. 

Replying this way proves you missed the entire point of that post. Top notch."
340,"You gave your ultimatum at the right time.

If she still refuses to contribute more cleaning around the house then I would lawyer up."
341,"I never said you hadn't. But with this comment you seem to be implying that Indian girls would be more attractive to you if they put in the same effort you do, and also implying that they don't currently. I'm now not sure your family doesn't have a point about you turning your nose up at non-white women for suspicious reasons. "
342,It's not your fault that you and your sister don't get along.  And it's not right for your Mom to expect you to put up with Sis just for the sake of appearances.
343,"I can't agree with you. He's been shit on for so long, it's totally normal for him to want to snap back. Most people would. It's not his job to provide expensive gifts only to be told 2 seconds later he's a disappointment.

Love is absolutly conditional. You are never required to love someone just because they're related to you, especially if they treat you and your lifestyle/choices badly. Especially parents. 

Sometimes people don't understand or what you say won't get through unless you do something like that, because 1. They don't think it's a big deal or 2. They think he'll just wuss out and not actually stand up for himself. 

I mean, yeah, we are only getting his side, but he seems like he's tried to not only explain and talk with them, but he also takes care of them. They expect him to do all these things but think it's ok to bite the hand that feeds them constantly because they can. 

They don't appreciate what he does, and if he got them shitty gifts or no gifts at all maybe they'd reevaluate."
344,"You should not give her two. She made her choice to give it to your sister and she should live with that. Shame your dad is paying part of the cost. 

What strikes me in the OP is how angry that it went to your sister. While rude to give a gift away, I wonder if your relationship with that sister isn't great and that is fueling part of the anger. 

The situation sucks and you should explain to your dad you are unable to help and be supportive of him. I would not want to draw myself further into this situation."
345,"Ah okay this makes sense now. Willing to bet she is younger and her parents lied about her age so they could send her to school sooner. My grandmothers family did this because they didn't have day time child care and it was the 30s and so she graduated at 16 but thought she was 18 at the time. She only found out her real age when she needed to apply to college. 

It's hard to get away with things like that in the US any more but in Mexico the record keeping may not be as good and it might be easier to fake someone's age. "
346,"There are so many terrifying behaviors here I don't even know where to start. I'm very glad you'll be contacting CPS. Please make sure you tell them about the ""scissoring"" incidents, in addition to the serious attempts to hurt/kill smaller and weaker creatures. Imitating sexual behavior like that is a major warning sign that the boy himself has been sexually abused at some point. "
347,"yeah...these all sound like warning signs. to play devil's advocate, though, do you think there could be something environmental going on? like maybe there is carbon monoxide or gas leaking in the house, but it's at such low levels it would only be affecting the animals? it could have made the cat disoriented.

edit to bring clarification higher: I don't really think that he didn't do it. I honestly think this sounds like the backstory of a *Criminal Minds* episode. but I also think there's a *possible* explanation that's very easy to verify and could also cause harm to her sister."
348,"You don't owe her anything just because she's related to you. 

Ask yourself this question - if there were no blood relation, would you even talk to her? I don't think so. 

She seems to be insufferable and entitled, and you need to realise fully that no matter what you do and how much you try, you will always be the 'bad guy' in her narrative. 

Get away from her and live your life. "
349,"As a gay dude who's done this song and dance (showtunes yassss *pukes*) so many times, your friend will probably never understand. Us gay guys are some sort of weird holy grail of fucked up friendship for these types of people. She's upset because you've basically called her out for being a creep. It's the same as straight guys begging their lesbian friend to watch girl on girl porn or help them get a girlfriend, but because it's ""just shopping"" and ""just talking about boys"" they think they're not being as creepy as those straight dudes. But they are. Even worse is when they know another gay person and decide that you two must become best friends (and possibly fuck).

Just stick it out for your friend Adam in this situation. Treat it like you would that you found out your friend has a weird dehumanizing fetish and stop trying to make her feel less shame over it. She should feel shame, it's probably the only way she'll stop being so fucking weird about this eventually."
350,"The blame for the initial break up is on your door step. It is OK you don't want to continue things now that your priorities are incompatible, but he's not blaming you for that, is he?"
351,"Hey. I actually think as a white person talking to another white person, it is TOTALLY your place to bring this up. It is absolutely casual racism. It clearly wasn't intended badly, and I think the word ""racism"" throws people off bc they think it has to be overt and malicious. And I would completely have the same problem re thinking about kids. What I would do is look up some stuff -- not on reddit -- about cultural appropriation and why it is damaging. Find things written by non-white people. Then sit your bf down and tell him you know his/his family's intentions were 100% good/innocent, but there are a lot of people who'd be genuinely hurt by this. "
352,I'm in IL. Can I help?
353,"You need to go get a lawyer, and you need to start looking into things like women/family shelters, welfare, food stamps, etc. You need to get away from him, get a lawyer to go after child support, and leave him."

Perhaps it would be in both your and your son's best interest if you saw someone to talk through these feelings. "
355,"You're probably getting downvoted on that comment because it comes across as a bit self-serving. Like ""look how awful she always is, so it's okay that I did this kind of shitty thing too, right?"" 

When I read that comment, coupled with other comments you've made, I wonder why you're still friends with her. You don't speak very kindly of her, and your avoidance has put her in a sad spot. 

Whether she's a terrible person or not, you don't come across as looking all that great either. 

Don't get me wrong - it sounds like this friendship isn't good for you, and we all make mistakes because we would rather avoid unpleasant situations and people. But that might be a part of what's going on with the downvotes. "
356,"She *is* listening to him. OP said he wants to get married in his late 20's. His wife wants an engagement this spring, and a wedding next year. That *does* make OP in his late 20's when he gets married. She's going off of *exactly* what he told her from the beginning of their relationship.

OP is just going back on his word now."
357,"&gt;We want to help him...

NOPE! Help your friend, help yourself. There's no need to help this guy who seems like he wants your friend to be as miserable as he is.
"
358,"Just fyi, he's paying his portion while all three of us share the house but he can't afford the increased rent if anybody moves out. That is sound advice though, I'll discuss with the gf and we'll see what happens. "
359,Tacky on his family's part.
360,"I'm gonna be fucking straight with you. You're a pedophile, and you cannot rebuild this relationship. It doesn't matter if you never met up with these young girls, you considered it, and tried to meet up with them. That's just as good as if you'd done it, cause it's obvious you were willing to.

In all honesty, I really hope somebody that knows what you did turns you in. While you didn't have sex with any of these girls, you did sext with them, and you asked them to meet up with you. That's incredibly dangerous behavior, and based on what you said, I don't think it'll stop. 


I'm begging you, because you seem like you have some sort of morals if you understand that what you did was wrong. Turn yourself into the police. Confess to the sexting, and get yourself some help. They'll be able to stop you before you do something that you'll never be able to go back from. "
361,"&gt; Any time a man says ""I'm not romantic"", all it really means is you're too fucking lazy and selfish to do something that would make your S/O feel special.

So much this! This was my ex husbands excuse for never doing anything even remotely nice for me. "
362,"If it's interfering with your relationship, it is becoming a problem."
363,"Sounds like you're single now, buddy. Poor girl's probably been waiting on tenterhooks since October, most likely beforehand, hoping you wouldn't run it down to the last possible moment...but then you did. You strung her along for too long, and now you've lost her."
364,"Bring a psych major is generally a bad idea.  Unless you plan on getting a masters, you won't have any trademark skills by the time you graduate.

365,Why are we all talking about when our parents banged each other?
366,"You are very right about the boundary setting, and unfortunately that's the part that makes me the most nervous (basically: discussing something like this in the cold light of day). I definitely concur that it could change our relationship with them, but I've carefully considered what that could look like and I'm *fairly* sure it wouldn't be a negative change. They also live 2,000 miles away from us, so it's not like they are on top of us all the time (heh). 

Oh, and this was actually my wife's idea, and she suggested it to me, so I'm certain that she's on board. If it had been my idea I'm pretty sure I'd never have had the gumption to voice it to my wife. "
367,"Try to find a way to talk to her just the two of you. Tell her about your experience with AN and that you know she is going through a lot right now and you've seen the signs. Being honest with her is best. Stress that you are only saying something because you are concerned for her health and that you are there for her if she needs you to be. 

Don't try to force it if she won't talk to you. "
368,Why would SHE have paid for HIS filing for citizenship?
369,"I live on the third floor, and have for years at different apartments.  I did modify the way I walk because the normal heel to toe movement I used to make when I moved into the top floor for the first time sounded like an elephant to the downstairs neighbors (floor was tile).  They asked me to tone it down.  I was mortified, but they were right, and I modified my walk.  I now walk on my whole foot or the balls of my feet without thought and all my downstairs neighbors since have commented on how quiet I am.  Walking that way took about a week to get used to.  Not a big deal to learn, but a huge deal to your downstairs neighbors quality of life.

To me they've made a reasonable request given the nature of the apartment.  If you don't believe how loud it is, take turns standing in the downstairs apartment while one of you walks upstairs, and think how you would like to be in your downstairs neighbors shoes.

Of course you could stick to your guns, but this typically starts a noise war or other problems.  Not worth it for an easy fix, IMO."
370,"My mom resisted Secret Santa until she finally lost her job and couldn't afford to do a full Christmas. She still won't participate, but she lets all the ""kids"" (five, the youngest two of whom are in college, plus our partners) do it. It cuts so much of the stress down, but she's just really emotionally attached to the whole Christmas experience with a pile of packages for everybody under the tree.

The idea of buying presents for fourteen adults just gives me hives, I don't know how OP manages."
371,"&gt;  It will be the most important day of my life. 

I very sincerely hope that is not the case.

Weddings are marvelous, weddings can be beautiful, emotional events. But it's just a wedding, OP. It's three hours of makeup for half an hour of ceremony and an hour of photographs.  It's a glorious bit of frippery, but it is frippery."
372,"Honestly, why are you still with him?  He said that the reason he was fooling around with Mandy is because he forgot about you.  Who forgets about their girlfriend?  Douches, that's who.  And the only reason why things didn't progress further is because of his alcohol intake.

This is your first relationship, so this might seem harsh.  Your b/f should be your ex.  You deserve better than this.  "
373,"Then it's time for a stronger message, that this is a dealbreaker and a relationship-ender if she doesn't start being a true partner and work with you as a team.  She may put in a token effort, but then go back to her lazy, selfish ways a week or couple of months later, and in which case, you have your answer.

Never marry someone that you expect to change.  It won't work, and resentment will build until you blow up.  If she's not willing to put in the effort, then cut your losses and go, and find someone who respects you as an equal.  You deserve no less than that, ok ?"
374,Definitely sounds like she could potentially have ADD. 
375,Sleep on the way back. Live life who cares if you go to work sleepy or miss a day.
376,"If the date corresponded to the first time they hooked up, wouldn't the date next to his name be an earlier date, unless they had sex the first time they hooked up? She either 1) had sex with OP the first time they hooked up, 2) had sex with 29 people, or 3) she doesn't add a name to the list until after she was through with them, then wrote the date that they went the furthest on. Only way for OP to know is to ask about her rubber list directly, but only if it's super important to him to have an accurate count."
377,"Are your siblings forgetting that they also drank breast milk before? 

No reason at all for you to be sick. It's just milk. You drank it as a kid. It was a silly mistake and it will blow over. "
378,"Shit. How did I get myself into this mess. He responded to my text by saying he ""didn't realize he hurt me and tends to ""lock himself in his shell"" which is just... a non-explanation. "
379,"Sure, but the point of this is to help improve OP's life, not judge her parents.  In this particular case, deciding they're assholes can only improve her life inasmuch as it gives her (them?) support about the validity of her internal experiences, which doesn't seem to be a huge problem since they already have each other as a support network.  (In all those 'should I break up with my abusive bf' / 'how do I impress my narcissist parents' cases, however...)"

382,I'm really sorry to hear that. 
383,"Why does he think they are right? 

To be fair, if they're paying for college, they have somewhat of a say over what you study. If you want to defy them, you do not need them to get loans for your own schooling. Art &amp; Dance are great majors, but sorry to be harsh, unless you already have a portfolio it's unlikely you'd be accepted into a tough program. Same goes for Dancing. My friend was like you, she initially went to college for Dance. She found out that it was a lot more work than she ever signed up for, transferred and is now an RN. I'd be wary of going for this unless you really understand the implications once you get out. "

They've been married for 6 years..even if they didn't move in together until they were married, she's had 6 years of ""guidance"". She needs to grow up and take care of her responsibilities. That's ridiculous and disgusting."
387,"You don't even have to give her any kind of ""deep"" reason you're discontinuing therapy through her: just the details of her tardiness with sessions is *plenty* enough reason to do so. 
 
Tell her ""I need a therapist who can be on time; you've shown over and over that you don't know how to do that.""  

Imagine she was an employee of yours that was *constantly* late.  
Firing that employee would be totally normal.   
Now, realize that your therapist actually *is* someone you employ.  
She's *supposed to work for you*, but can't be on time.   

Fire away, and that's all you really need to tell her. (I'd tell her more, but that's me. You're asking for an easy out; *you've already got a perfect one*.)        "

395,"&gt; I was going to respond to the group Facebook msg to say I had fun and to reference the comment somehow, but not sure how to do it

Don't do it. You will make it worse by turning it into a thing. You will look a little unhinged. 

Nobody is going to remember that comment. The other girls aren't going to start another group chat without you in it like ""OMG can you believe Jennifer threw popcorn? How tacky!"" You care about this a million times more than everyone else. I think your friend was just trying to outline some shenanigans you guys got into, and a big part of that to people is often laughing about shit you did drunk. If you were throwing popcorn in church, people would think that you're a little whacko, but you were at a bar, the assumption is that you're drunk, it's really no big deal.

On a deeper level, I feel like you're embarassed about your own actions. Your post and comments come across as you want to see yourself as a classy lady who only goes to classy places and is above going to a bar with lesser people throwing popcorn and dancing on bars and you don't want to be reminded of even going to a place like that. It's okay to unwind and have some fun. If your friends would judge you for going somewhere a little more low brow than your usual spots, then they are kinda shitty. "

400,"I haven't experienced directly this, but I have certainly felt pressured into trying sweets when I didn't want them because others were trying them, goading me into it, and putting on the guilt-trip because they were homemade. A lot of people see rejection of homemade food as a rejection of the person, so they eat it even if they really don't feel like it. Depending on how often OP bakes (given that she just moved to her location 6 months ago and only recently has Alex been giving her the stink eye, I am guessing it is pretty frequently), I could see OP's constant baking becoming grating instead of generous. "
401,"Jesus.  They were not ""put between a rock and a hard place.""

Not because I'm an alcoholic but because it's just obviously a difference in opinions and lifestyle that would lead to some serious resentment. 

Also, a shot of liquor has the same alcohol content as a standard beer. So he's not drinking significantly more than he usually does by having one drink with liquor in it. "

I think I'd assume that this woman doesn't want to date you and move on.  I never condone calling someone a ""bitch""; that's not okay.

After reading your original post, to be honest he probably feels bad for you because YOU have no respect for yourself.  This dude cheats on you for two fucking years and you just give him another chance for nothing?  Then he does it again and you think counseling might save it?  Whoever was giving you advice both of those times failed you horribly - or you just didn't take their very obvious advice to leave the cheater.  You should really get some counseling of some sort.  And good luck in the divorce, if your business is as successful as you imply, you're going to need the luck if you don't have a prenup.

From the prior post:

&gt;but I'm still reeling at being cheated on for nearly 90% of my relationship.

Most people would have long since bailed.  Giving a second/third chance is not virtuous.  Only when you literally have no other option, as you did here, do you finally take real action to stand up for yourself.

&gt;But he started back up, and I discovered it 6 months ago, saying it was a mistake, he was trying to get some belongings back. I agreed to counseling and monitoring his phone and social media. He is unemployed so he could support mine and Jeff's dreams by moving and would have to move back to our small town where he has no opportunity. I moved him here, so I feel responsible for him.

It was the same woman?"

Your dick is not going to change her life for the better, so get this notion of your penis being magical out of here. Forcing her into sexual acts before she's ready is one of those things people tend to regret, maybe even some still while on their deathbeds.

Try to save the bloodletting for your husband and consider blocking her on all forms of social media. It isn't going to do you any good to keep anger shopping by watching her live a young carefree life.

430,"You're right on point. It's a symbiotic relationship.

The dad sounds like a guy I knew. Successful with a penchant for younger women after his wife left him. Turns out, he was a bit of an emotional masochist and wanted to be dominated emotionally &amp; financially, but would never go to see a ""findomme''. It's a very low possibility, but maybe pops likes that sort of thing. Or maybe self confidence issues. 


Hopefully, OP can gently talk to his dad. I don't condone with her behavior in front of the kids. It's kind of ridiculous. "
431,"That's *exactly* what happens in these sorts of places. She wasn't being flown to Dubai and Indonesia to dance coyly in a bikini. She was being flown there to fuck wealthy businessmen and Saudi princes.

No wonder she is exhausted if she's doing absolutely everything, which is what it sounds like. Also, how is he ""clearly a family man"" if he's more interested in playing sports then looking after his new baby with OP? Oh and not to mention he wants to pay his other child to do it for him?

In the mean time, it sounds like you're not ready to be in a relationship right now and that it's not really good for you or your partner. I'd recommend you take time (months or years) to be single. To get to know yourself as an adult person who is not with your ex, to see a therapist, to grow as a person. Over time, your feelings will fade. But great job on the no contact! That's definitely going to pay off."

437,"&gt;How can I not worry about him, knowing how unhappy he is? How can I not blame myself? I'm desperately needing advice on how to cope and move forward.

I normally wouldn't do this like this, but you just don't. You need to be firm with yourself and recognize that those thoughts are unreasonable and dangerous. They are just thoughts, they can be ignored. Part of making good decisions is recognizing which of our thoughts are sensible and which are not and acting on the sensible ones. He is abusive. He abused you to the point that his roommates refuse to tolerate him. That's his fault. You have broken up with him, that was a great move and you're going to keep it that way. 

And it wasn't the xanax. Xanax is a sedative, it puts you on your ass. He was abusive with and without xanax because he is abusive. 

You are free. Stay that way. Make yourself busy, block him on every possible form of contact and do things you like to do. Tell the people you live with that he's not welcome and you are no contact because he hit you. Avoid him and be kind to you."
438,"Adding to what everyone has said so far, I find it a but odd she's online meeting guys when she is pregnant and the ex is not involved. I'd be very careful and try to be sure she is not looking just for a dad to her baby, but that she is looking for a partner as well. 

Just keep in mind she may be looking for a warm body to play dad and pay the bills. Yes, she has a support network, but she might feel socially pressured to get a man by her side.

I am not saying that's the case; just consider this scenario before taking any decision."
439,This is essential information. Even parents completely ok with their daughter having a bf would try to break this up. 
440,[deleted]
441,I'm really curious as to what this bozo commenter thinks you should have done instead. Sat silently and hoped she magically divined that you wanted to move to CA and brought it up herself??
442,Did you miss the part where I said I've already lost more than a stone in the space of three weeks?
443,"A good way to slow down might be to schedule your time with a little more structure. You say you slept with each other every night for a month? Maybe consider making Sat/Sun + Wednesday ""sleepover"" days, but you have to separate for the other nights. 

It might also be a good idea to structure actual dates. If you've been accustomed to just Netflix And Chill with each other, it's easy to let the sexual chemistry take over and not notice if you two are compatible in interests, politics, conversation, etc. Going out and doing activities with clothes on might be good for establishing whether you two have chemistry outside the bedroom. 

Good luck!"
444,"I mean, it could also be read as they weren't ready before due to age or money issues and now they are ready. Really, trying to read into a few lines of text is probably a bad idea.

My situation is different from OP's, but I met my father at 20 and while everything was awkward at first, I'm so glad that I chose to connect with him and the other side of my family. OP has a loving family and has little to nothing to lose by learning more about his birth family. That was my reasoning for meeting my father and I'm glad I didn't shut him out."
445,Embarrassment and humiliation can exist outside of others.
446,"Oh my god DO NOT talk about this with your parents. I get that it's hard to see your baby brother in a different light but he's becoming an adult and sexuality and the discovery of is completely healthy. I would maybe frame it in a way like ""hey bro, so I know you're getting older and maybe noticing new things. If there's anything you wanna talk about? Any girls or boys that might interest you, no judgement. I love you and just want you to be safe."" 

This is what's most important. If you embarrass him by talking about it with all these other people first, he may retreat and keep everything to himself. He's growing up. Have a grown up conversation with him without judgement. Real talk, really helps.

And for the love of God... DO NOT TALK ABOUT DICK PICS WITH YOUR PARENTS. "
447,"Yes,  being in love can feel like addiction. But obsession is a step further because the other person is being objectified. "
448,Wow...you are not compatible with this person.  You are compatible with what you wish he was.  That person is a fantasy.  
449,"I'm confused how this kind of desi American even exists still. Like she's 24 she's not a ""fresh"" adult and she isn't in control of her own marriage? I'm Pakistani and this just boggles my mind. I've heard of threats or disapproval. I've even seen people who [rightfully] cut from their  families because of these kinds of threats. But I've never witnessed a forced marriage actually take place. It sounds like OPs girlfriend is just spineless. "
450,"Well-being and feeling safe is more important though. He married a hairy girl, he got a hairy girl. If he expected her to keep grooming forever, he was naive. 

Also, why should she change and not him? Women have always been hairy, so why not learn to be attracted to it like men have in our entire history as human beings. "
451,"I really hope so. OP sounds insufferable, childish, and not ready for the responsibility coming his way. "
452,"Basically you're saying you guys have the same maturity level, right? So at 26 he has the maturity level of an 18-year-old? 

...And you're FINE with this???

Edit: It's awesome that you're more mature for your age, in fact, that's encouraged! But, why would you then want to date someone who is immature for theirs? "
453,"OP, pay attention to this! I've been on NuvaRing for over a decade, but my good friend got extremely depressed and it took far too long to figure out what it was. My friend was fine, but still watch for signals."
454,"Saving it for a nicer guest, what if the president happens by and needs soap??"
455,"&gt; well he also told that when he sees me he wants to marry me

This is not good.  This is a classic red flag.  You are old enough to know this.

Also?  **ACTIONS ALWAYS TRUMP WORDS.**

Also also?  You are projecting a fantasy of love onto this relationship.  This is...not good.

"
456,"It looks like I'm tricking her because of her crazy delusions. I BUSTED my ass to run my business. What the fuck do I get out of scamming her? Some loan money that I will have to pay back? Like in my OP, were I a scammer, I would've scammed bigger things from her family, and be out sooner. This is fucking ridiculous."
457,"My boyfriend of almost 3 years is a slow pace relationship kinda guy. He is very meticulous and very private. This year, not only did I get to spend Thanksgiving with his amazing family, but we are moving in together in a few months! I'm so happy and I feel like our relationship is stronger than ever."
458,"They have different versions of Jesus, that's one of the problems. "
459,"Thank you so much for posting this. This was the kind of insight I was looking for. You are so right about the way he acts when people bring up his service. I used to do it too until he told me how uncomfortable it makes him. I worry a little about his drinking also but I've only seen him visibly drunk a handful of times but it seems like he goes through his rum pretty fast but it doesn't seem to affect his life so I don't bother him about it. I'm looking into No Barriers, it looks like something he may like and I'll bring it up to him when he gets home."
460,"These are absolutely justified actions and I think you're handling this in a very mature way.  Your mom may not see it that way, but that doesn't mean you're wrong. You've set your boundaries and are sticking to them.  If anything, this is admirable."
461,"&gt;I feel like he is not being supportive of my dream after we talked about it.

He likely- and rightly- isn't supportive of you wanting to move in with him just so you can save up for bikes and not listening to realistic concerns. Your relationship should be more important than cycling. 

You are basically turning your relationship into hobby funding and shoving aside the basics like ""Are we actually ready for this"" and ""Is this a good idea?"". "
462,"Come to think of it, she initiated it but I turned her down multiple times, told her I was seeing Hannah so I said we could remain friends and keep talking. We start reminiscing about the relationship and why it ended, and why we kept fighting. Couldn't figure out why we were fighting, so we believe that the time apart was enough for us to grow and that time has changed everything. "
463,"Woah. I'm polyamorous and in an open marriage. And if my SO pulled the crap you pulled I'd be furious. This is about CONSENT and you took that choice from your husband. You ask him BEFORE you travel with a ""friend"", male or female. How on earth could he trust you when you've clearly shown him you're not trustworthy? "
464,"Maybe this is just master level trolling? She's fairly articulate and has a career, can she be this dense? I mean the issue isn't that she wants to sometimes travel separately from her husband, or even that she wants to have male friends and travel with them, I have a boyfriend and do this -- it's the lying. 

What kind of a person goes on vacation without telling their spouse? The husband found out afterwards what she was really up to despite them keeping in contact while she was gone which means not once did she mention she was on vacation with another man. She knows she fucked up, like divorce level fucked up. She knows she disgraced her marriage and vows. She knows her husband will never be able to trust her or believe her again but she's so desperate to find a way to paint this poor man as the villain. It's sad really. Or a troll. Idk."
465,"Either he gets help forhis depression or you walk, that's all there is to it."
466,"&gt;I am frightened of calling his bluff because I'm afraid he'll use it to say 'aha! you don't care about me after all, fine we are breaking up. you're so manipulative'

Don't let him bait you into arguing like that. If he starts pulling out accusations that you don't care about him, tell him, ""You're free to think what you want. I'm not going to try to stop you."" And then show him the door."
467,"OH MY GOD, thank you. FINALLY a person on the internet who isn't breaking out the fucking pitchforks because someone is religious.

Fucking HELL people, I'M RELIGIOUS AND SEXUAL AND DON'T CONDONE SEXUAL ASSAULT. Religion isn't the problem here, its this girls interpretation of it and her serious inability to respect boundaries. 
 

"
468,"That is so utterly horrible. He intended to use you as an incubator/meal ticket and was ready to bring a child into the world so that he could avoid having to get a job and support himself. 

I wish you the best of luck over the next couple of months, OP.
"
469,You have a 4 year old kindergardner who cooks three meals and does laundry??? My kid couldn't even reach the stove top at that age.
470,"I've explained to her twice exactly how I feel, so I believe I need to take this a step further this time around. I am going to suggest she at the very least take a break to focus on us, and stop communicating with this stranger. 

I certainly don't want her to have zero amount of alone time, but I give her my attention when I am not at work 90% of the time and expect the same in return."
471,"IKR? I thought this was an issue of feeling physically lonely and wanting to be surrounded by people... Nope, OP is a product of her own self-centerness. "
472,"I think you know this is not about the table.

Honestly there just has to be so much you haven't told us, that I dont think we can give meaningful advice. His resentment has clearly been building a looooong time, but buying the house, and the imminent baby has made him panic - ""this is my life now"" and start to feel claustrophobic. 


Anyway, start by seeing your lawyer and finding out your options for child support etc.

*Edited due to good point by u/Springheeled_Jill"
473,"Did you confirm with her that you were still on for Saturday?  It is possible that they had to cancel and she might have felt bad for you that you had to leave early.  So yea, comminicate a lot BEFORE the date to make sure you are still on.

Second of all, she isnt really 'your girlfriend'. You are just some person she is dating until you talk about being exclusive. But yes, I think you are being a little too clingy here.   First message was fine, but the messages and calls after just smack of deseperation.  Just chill out a bit.

Also, you are ok to be upset.  She should have been more considerate of you, but you did not handle either the communication before or after effectively.

Its ok though, just take it as a lesson learned.  I did many things in my younger days that I still super cringe over.  You'll get there bro!"
474,"So he's deeply remorseful and ashamed for sexting with her, but made plans to see her yesterday? What do you think would have happened if you didn't push him on this? He isn't sorry, cut your losses before he tries to see what else you're willing to put up with."
475,"I am going to tell you exactly what I would tell a female friend if she were to describe this scenario/ progression of events to me:

He is a predator. This is not your fault. You did not consent. He is a predator. 

1. Because you are male, he waited until it was the two of you, alone--until no one else was in the house to question his behavior, or why he was steadily getting you drunker while pressuring for sex

2. You were sober enough, at first, to reject his advances, **saying no when he tried to kiss you**

3. After you rejected his attempt to kiss you, he esclated straight to offering a blowjob (reasoning, no doubt, that who on MDMA says no to orgasms, right?) and **you said no to that, too**

4. So he gave you more MDMA and shots of alcohol

See what happened? At this point, you were drunkish and high on MDMA, but clearly in control enough to recognize unwanted sexual advances, draw firm boundaries, and refuse said sexual advances. 

What you DIDN'T have your guard up against was friendly behaviour, or the ability to differentiate between a friend and sexual predator. He offered you more drugs and alcohol in the guise of friendship to intentionally to lower your boundaries, leading to step:

5. Suggesting wrestling, an activity you mentioned having done earlier with your other friends, so was coded by drunk you as ""friendship,"" but was his way of gaining physical access to:

6. Feel you up and kiss your neck--He's acclimating you to his touch. 

7. You push him away, **still aware enough to signal you do not consent**

8. You say ""we were both out of it,"" but it sounds like he knew what he was doing. You were out of it; he was pressuring you for sex. 

9. After hours of being plied with MDMA, alcohol, acclimated to his touch, and subjected to repeated requests for sex, you agree to a massage. 

**NOTE** This is not consenting to sex, or sexual activity. This is the equivalent of throwing a crumb, or a bone, and is a common reaction in situations like this, when the victim knows the predator and was relying on them for a safe sleeping space after drinking/drug use. The victim offers something like this--a massage, a foot rub, cuddling--because they feel trapped and unable to escape, but are hoping in their drunken state that by conceding this, the predator will stop badgering them and the situation will end. Drunk/drugged reasoning is not sober reasoning. 

**Second note**: Not really inherently gay. In this instance, predatory with sexual intent, but I'm pretty sure male-on-male platonic massage is a thing

10. He uses the massage as an excuse to kiss up on you again

11. **You push him away,** ie reject him/ clearly signal non consent again

12. Finally, after several drunk hours using MDMA, where he's intentionally been constantly touching, stroking, and kissing you to induce sexual arousal despite you repeatingly saying no and clearly signaling non-consent, you agree to masturbate for him. 

**Note** Like the massage, this is still not consenting to sex--he plied you with drugs and alcohol, took advantage of your apparent reliance on his hospitality, and continually badgered you for sexual fulfilment until you agreed to provide, essentially, a live cam show to shut him up. Even at the point where events are getting foggy and difficult to recollect for you, your still not consenting; you're being verbally coerced.

13. While you're jerking off, he takes control and gives you a hand, and you can't remember if you invited him, he asked, or he just grabbed. **Doesn't matter.** At this point in the story, you're clearly so out of it you cannot consent.

You were sexually assaulted by a sexual predator. His actions throughout the evening were calculated steps to strip your defenses so he could perform said assault. Jesse's boyfriend may be gay or bisexual or sexually fluid, who knows? What is clear is that he is a predator and sexual assailant.

You need to talk to Jesse, and you for damn sure need to get that video. I bet you will be shocked at how out of it you actually are once you get ahold of it. I'm willing to bet you're barely coherent."
476,"&gt;getting into the wrong crowd

Says the dude who has been grooming this girl since she was 14.

&gt;i have matured a huge amount from the dumb 18 year old horny guy who made some very stupid decisions by messing with this girl at her age

I mean the age gap is *still* a bit weird dude.


&gt; I'm older and a virgin 

No shit, one would hardly notice.

How do you even know she slept around? How do you know she didn't know those people?

And even if she slept with 100s of people the minute of meeting them, that doesn't mean she has to do the same with you. 

Maybe she doesn't want to do that anymore. Maybe she doesn't want to do that with you (that needn't mean bad things, maybe she wants to try something different with you). Maybe all those people gave off less of a creep vibe than you do. 

&gt;Should I just chill and go with it

If you're able to stop pressuring this girl for sex then yes. "
477,"Today I was wearing a torn and bleach stained tshirt, old jeans, and had my nasty ass hair (I let it get dirty when I'm about to dye it) in a shitty little bun. I was working with art stuff that tends to stain and tends to smell. When I brought my husband a sandwich (I was already going to make myself one, I asked who else in the house wanted one while I was at it), he kissed me on the cheek and said, ""Thanks cutie!""

My husband is 33. He is older than your boyfriend. He's also nicer and more respectful. Because you see, he does not value his preferences on my appearance more than he values my comfort. He has never once told me I look homely. Not in fifteen years has he ever tried to guilt me into changing my appearance for him. Because that would be disgustingly unreasonable.

I am your boyfriend's age. He sounds like a petulant child. Nobody your boyfriend's age would put up with that garbage. Neither should anyone your age. Relationship bare minimum is someone who's nice to you, RESPECTS YOU, and cares for your comfort. In this, your boyfriend has shown none of these traits.

Your instincts are telling you something is very wrong here. Else, you wouldn't be here asking strangers on the internet if it's normal for your romantic partner to insult you, degrade you, and blatantly ignore your comfort. Well, here is your answer. No. It's not normal. It's not healthy. It's not okay for him to treat you like a thing. 

This is not what love looks like and you know it. And I bet if your best friend told you her boyfriend called her homely and withheld affection because she wore a sweater, you'd tell her to kick his disrespectful ass to the curb. You are not a thing. You are not obligated to be pretty all of the time. Anyone who insists that you must...they certainly do not love you. "
478,You should work on it. Maybe individual therapy isn't a bad idea on top of the couples counseling. It sounds like you have some stuff to tackle on top of your reaction to the situation. I hope everything works out for you guys.
479,"&gt;  I suggested we add cheese, she responded back that that was the dumbest idea ever and started yelling at me and causing a scene

That's abusive.  

&gt;  I would prefer if the dog didn't lay in OUR bed, but she's told me that's too bad it's just the way it's going to be. She also told me that if we move in together she wants to get a second dog, and that I should get used to the idea of both dogs being on the beds, the couch, etc.

That is super disrespectful and controlling.

I don't even think you should date her, let alone move in with her.  Don't accept abuse as just ""part of her personality"".  Abuse is deliberate.  She treats you this way because she doesn't respect you, and by yelling at you she gets her way.  Sh knows what she's doing and she doesn't care that it hurts you.

Please reconsider if this is how you want to be treated for the rest of your life."
480,"A threesome isn't the time or place to deal with personal insecurities about your partner. A threesome will force you to see your partner having sex with someone else, kissing someone else, being intimate with someone else while you look on. This kind of thing can completely destroy how you view your partner if your conscious allows it. So, you have 2 potential results from this threesome: 1. You face your insecurities and move past them in an instant and enjoy yourself for 30 minutes, 2. You're completely horrified by what you see and possibly never recover. I'd say that a version of result *2* is most likely, and result *1* isn't even comparably worth the risk. Weighing between those two options is like pressing a mystery button: pressing the button with either burn your house down, *or* Youll win 1000$. You don't want to press the button unless you're *1,000,000% sure* it will give you 1k."
481,"For those frustrated...she posted this in a cross-post in a legal sub:

&gt;update2
He came back. He lied. I was upset and looked it. we gave him enough rope to make excuse after changing excuse. First he was shocked sticksy was gone, and would help look for him. Then he was shocked someone took him to a vet to be put down. Then when confronted with proof it was him, he claimed sticksy was hit by a car and he had to end his suffering. When confronted with a live happy sticksy he turned it around and it ended with him telling me he should have had me put down.
My coworker and her partner and I told him he was not welcome in the house any more and that they were moving in with me, and everyone in the house (and the neighbour we both get on well with who saw him return on Friday to take sticksy) now knows what kind of person he was. He left of his own accord and took some of his stuff. I'm no closer to knowing for sure why he tried what he did. Sorry for jamming up legaladvice with this one, it wasn't much of a legal ending."
482,"Then this was her polite way of telling you that, but giving you the benefit of the doubt in case you weren't actually asking her out/without outright rejecting you. Neither rude nor clueless imo."
483,"How long have you been together? Have you met his mom?

Most people talk to their friends differently from how they talk to their parents. Plus not everyone has the same relationship with their parents. I feel like many people here are going to go straight to saying something's ""not right"", but talk to him about it and try and understand his perspective. Not everyone is as open or communicative as the next person."

486,"My mom would never stop paying for school. She wants me to be successful over everything and she would not cut me off like that. And if she did I'd just become a stripper so jokes on her (stop guys that was a joke). 

I don't think this will be permanently damaging to our relationship and honestly I appreciate all the stories people have about their families coming to terms with their tattoos. I think I'm going to go ahead with it. "
487,You have kids and you moved in with a dude you've only been dating for 6 months!? Why!? You're moving *way* too fast. That in itself is a red flag but bringing kids along into it? No no no no no no no. 
488,"No.

This isn't him ""asking"" her for anything.

He should file a paternity case in court. If he doesn't do this, then he's not really interested in fatherhood and all his words are just noise."
489,"You've got a wife problem, not a SIL problem.

How does your SIL know in the first place? Did your wife tell her? If she did, THAT'S NOT OK.

The fact that your wife is pumping you for the gruesome details instead of supporting you at your own pace is NOT OK.

The fact that your wife has not had a very serious discussion with her sister about how inappropriate and vile it is to interrogate and insinuatingly dismiss your claims is NOT OK.

You've got a wife problem. She's not safe. Don't tell her one tiny detail until she's proven she can keep her big mouth shut about your private business. She should not under any circumstances be gossiping about this to her sister. That is vile behavior. Vile.

Unfortunately male victims of molestation and sexual abuse often face this kind of reaction. I suggest you outline your wife's inapproriate behavior to her and explain that because she has basically created and encouraged this toxic, awful, anathema-to-recovery situation, you will not be going to her family's for the holidays. You would be entitled to cut SIL out entirely for her unforgivable behavior. I suggest you go to therapy together, but make it crystal clear that you are not comfortable getting into the nitty gritty until your wife proves herself trustworthy. Which will take a long time."
490,"One, she's already rejected you. That's your answer, whether or not you like it.
 
Two, she's still a minor. Even if she DIDN'T reject you, which she did, you have no business dating her anyway.

You need to leave her alone. Seriously."
491,"Haha I'm just vividly recalling the very pretty snow globe I smashed around that age because I wanted to play with the figurine inside it. I realized what I'd done a split second after I did it and was quite upset.

I may have just been an exceptionally stupid 7 year old. "
492,"She's 7, she is not just some kid that does not know better.  And obviously your sister knows better.  This was clearly planned just to be spiteful.  There is no way in hell I would ever apologize.  And she clearly would not be invited to the wedding, no matter what.  Stand your ground here OP."
493,"If they want her to stay over, OP has given the conditions that would make her willing. It's up to them what they value more highly."
494,"Shit has a noticeable impact on daily battery life if you leave it on all the time 

At least it does for me "

496,"How is this helpful? If you believe OP is lying, then ignore this, or down-vote; stop feeding into what you think might be attention-seeking behavior. "
497,"He'll be here for another two weeks, then he will be in AZ with my aunt and uncle for a month, and then back here for another month I think. I'm not worried about him coming into my room or anything, me and my parents rooms are upstairs and across the hall from each other.

I do not think he is lying at all. The fact that he did it in front of my dad, plus this being a one-time unusual issue makes me think he really did not remember it. Also, he has a very aggressive personality and usually comments on me not hanging out with him and my grandma, me being in my room all the time, or makes fun of the very american things that I do. Since the incident, which was 3 days ago, he hasn't said a single word to me. I think he is very embarrassed and is avoiding contact with me as well."
498,"Because I'm kind of an ass, when he gets back afterwards I'd just say something like ""so how was shopping with 'The Hippo' [air quotes] [pointed stare]?"" Even if your mum has been rude or disrespectful to him without you knowing, the constructive way to have dealt with it would have been to tell you immediately, not just bully her."
499,Omg this made me laugh. Weak pull out game bro! 
500,"How is it a ""mistake"" for him to have written *his own* private thoughts in *his* journal?  
There's no mistake there, whatsoever.  
Like, zero percent mistake.  
The *only* ""mistake"" that was made was OP's, when she decided she had the right to go snooping in someone else's private journal.   
(Period.) "
501,"No one is entitled to your friendship...in fact, it's quite normal for relationships to wax and wane as people grown up and find their own paths in life. One day your friend may be able to get clean and stay clean but for now, I think it's in your own best interest if you distance yourself for awhile as drug addiction is some serious shit and most people aren't able to recover until they've hit rock bottom. You don't want her taking you with her on her way to the bottom. Be frank with her, ""what I saw the other day makes me extremely uncomfortable. It's up to you to take the reins and get clean and sober and until you can do that, I think it's best if I don't come around for awhile."""
502,"You should for sure tell your parents, what your siblings did was fucked up (how old are they?). And then you get that poor kid's back because you're not a garbage monster in a human suit."
503,"I hear you refer to it as an 'open' relationship but A) You never saw other people and B) You moved in together. 

You were pretty much dating whether you want to admit it to yourself or not. Now it has been determined that the two of you are incompatible so you are pretty much an ex-boyfriend. Give her time to heal before re-entering her life as a friend. "
504,"She doesn't have to have a degree to be something other than a nanny!  There are so many options, please encourage her to apply to positions she would find interesting even if she doesn't feel 100% qualified while she's looking. There are employers out there who are willing to train people and she can grow from a lower position. "
505,"Black bear. 

Fact. Bears eat beets. Bears. Beets. Battle Star Galactica. "
506,"Therapy. 

She put the lifelong commitment of raising a child on you without your knowledge at all. She took that from you and it was wholly disgusting. 

Condoms, every single time. If you can ever feel okay enough to have sex with her again. Frankly I'd really consider this magnitude of deception to be a deal breaker. "
507,"It'll end up being worse for her if you take the high road. She'll see she cheated on a great guy.

509,"Yes typo, definitely not living with my ex"
510,"Unfortunately, this is one of those red flags that the results of only become clear once it's too late. He just threatened your friend over the phone with a very real gun. Do you really want to stick around to find out if there is more trouble down this rabbit hole?"
511,No no no no no no no no no. This is a ridiculous and awful request and you should seriously reconsider marriage/moving in together plans.
512,To me it sounds like she cheated.
513,"You have deluded yourself about Jane. She isn't into you, she doesn't love you, and she's using you. She sounds tiresome and impossible to please and is OBVIOUSLY cheating on you with Peter. Have some self respect."
514,"You made a mistake and pretty much threw away any chance to have your opinion heard by your sister and brother-in-law. I'm sure it hurt, but it's a 3-year-old. You should have grabbed him sternly, by both arms, and yelled NO. YOU DON'T DO THAT!

I think you do need to apologize for slapping him. That said, your sister and bil definitely have some parenting issues. They won't listen to you now, but hopefully they will eventually see they are raising a brat."
515,"Hang on a second--'[almost 16 f]' minus '6 years ago'... were you following some Tumblr porn blogs at the age of ten? Nine? I just Googled it to check and they don't let you use Tumblr unless you're 13. And your mom found out and... she didn't ask you any questions about this? She told your siblings and gave you an embarrassing nickname to your extended family? 

I am slightly more concerned about your mom and her reaction now. "
516,"You can't afford to be optimistic... but let's be real here, you can't afford to be pessimistic. What's your pessimism gotten you so far? A job at Target and afraid to move because it might mean a chance that you get out of your rut.

I hate to act like an armchair psych here, but ... lack of motivation, etc... have you talked with someone to see if you're suffering from depression?"
517,Agree with this. The thought of running into someone's dirty hand print on the wall makes me gag a little (wash your hands OP!)
518,"&gt;the only time our parents would ever meet

Then maybe you should have put it off another year."
519,"My fiancé runs a game store, unfortunately it's pretty common."
520,"Oh, gosh. It is incredibly common for parents to have favorite children and for them to treat their own biological children unequally. Sometimes they don't even realize they're doing it. My parents still warp reality in their minds to try to account for the differences in how my brother and I were treated--they've even created entire fake memories to explain why he received something (things, attention, whatever) and I didn't. They just decide that of course I received that thing too, and this allows them to go on their merry way believing that they are great parents. 

And I didn't even have a scapegoat vs. golden child situation, either. I think my family was actually pretty normal. "
521,"I think you're conflating two separate issues: 

1. Your friend's boyfriend limited your activities (only being able to go to 2 restaurants), because he presumably wouldn't eat anything that other restaurants served. This comes down to effort, I think, and if OP's girlfriend is making an effort to find stuff on the menu when they go to new and different restaurants, this is easy to overcome. Perhaps she got the Thai fried rice every time they went to that restaurant because she thought, hey, my boyfriend really wants to try this new Thai place, so I'll find something on the menu that I can eat, while he tries other dishes. If she's making that effort with every restaurant he wants to try (or at least most), then she's not inconveniencing anyone. ETA: It's hard to tell where OP's GF falls on this. On one hand, he has to skin and debone her chicken at his parents' house, but on the other hand, he doesn't want to bring her along with his friends because it's...""embarrassing"" that she doesn't like chicken wings? That rubs me the wrong way and makes it sound like they're judging her for just wanting to eat something she prefers at a restaurant they like. I could be reading that wrong, though.

2. Then there's the issue of your friend not being able to share the *experience* of being a foodie with her boyfriend. That comes down to a matter of preference. We all get to have preferences, and at the end of the day, only OP can decide whether he prefers to date someone who is an adventurous eater."
522,"So he can't take no for an answer. That's really gross. If I say no to my husband for whatever reason, the discussion drops there. What else does he throw tantrums about when he doesn't get his way? "
523,Quite probable it's a ring that wouldn't cover an hour of lawyer time 
524,"It's perfectly fine to break up due to incompatibility. She should probably start looking for partners based on the fetish, because this is the kind of kink that just weirds most people who aren't into it out, nor it is something you can really compromise on."
525,The fact that she's covering her tracks doesn't bode well for her trustworthiness.
526,"For real, when I first read this I felt like I had lost my mind whilst everyone else was all ""good job OP"". No"
527,"Your story will sound better if you and other F partner up and corroborate each other's versions of events, plus add the groping, garbage smearing and nudity.

Try to go in this as a united front."
528,Was that directed at Tim? Because that's the only way your comment would make any sense. How could being sober have prevented a guy from unexpectedly kissing her? 
529,"&gt;my previous girlfriend never did either but she said she'd never had an orgasm before.

Why would you judge your girlfriend based on your prior girlfriend? When you two fooled around did you make it clear that you cared about her pleasure? Did you ever *ask* her how to turn her on, how to please her, or how to make her come?

She's right that she shouldn't have to ask you to go down on her. Oral sex should be standard-giving and receiving.

You say your confidence is ""shattered."" What does this have to do with your sexual prowess? It sounds to me like it has a lot more to do with your sexual connection with partners, and the level of effort you put into getting partners off. Don't make this about you-it's not about your dick or your body. It's about what you *do*. Do more to communicate with partners and to help your partners get off."
530,"Where did I say she shouldn't shower?

My response is directly to the incredulity that she's sensitive about this issue, because that commenter personally is not sensitive about the same issue."
531,"The problem probably wasn't the questions you were asking, but their tone and presentation. I mean, you asked other people about how to handle your girlfriend's normal but private bodily functions - that's got to be pretty embarrassing. 

Your girlfriend is 21 years old, she's had a period for about a third of her life now. She knows how to handle it. If she's wearing a tampon, that *is* used to block the blood; it's a wad of cotton designed to soak it all up.

You've made having a period seem like a scary and gross thing, which it isn't. You can ask your girlfriend if she'll wear pads to bed as a back-up if you buy them for her. If she refuses, buy a bottle of hydrogen peroxide for accidental stains, apologize to your girlfriend and trust that she'll handle her own body. You're not this concerned about cum stains on your sheets, are you?"
532,"Calendar idea:

If you want to take pictures and make a calendar, that's fine, but it costs money. You'll have to do a production run of at least 1000 to get a good discount from printers. It might cost you $2 per calendar. Then you've gotta turn around and sell 1000 calendars at $10 each. How are you going to do this? Posting an ad on craigslist? listing on ebay? This takes time and sometimes money. Sell to friends? go door to door?

Making calendars isn't the hard part. Selling calendars is the hard part."
533,"Just because she is bi doesn't mean she wants group sex. So approach that carefully.

I think your priority now is to help reassure her and work on helping her deal with her current issues. Just be loving and understanding and find ways to express it that aren't hindered by her period."
534,"There's a point where the more you try, the more the other person tunes you out. If it hasn't been explicit - tell her that you love her and want to give her space but that you're there at any point, 24/7. 

It's not like the movies where you can show up with a boom box blasting Peter Gabriel and suddenly everything is wonderful. 

Also, recommend that she get some counseling for this. It's quite a trauma that she's been through. "
535,"Yeah, he doesn't. We had this conversation a few months ago where I basically said, ""I like you and I think we can be good together so why don't we give it a try"". He turned me down and gave me the usual: I like you a lot, but I don't want to be in a  relationship right now and I don't want to lose what we have, you're so important to me etc etc.

So, I dropped it and we're just friends now. I mean, I know I'm attracted to him of course, but that doesn't mean i enjoy his behavior. If anything it makes me feel bad because here is a guy who made it clear he doesn't want to date me, or be my boyfriend, but he kids around about having his penis in my mouth. I find it disrespectful the more i think about it."
536,"Kids that age do want to help as much as they can. I used to be a nanny for a preschooler, and he always wanted to help cook and help with the laundry."
537,He invited me for dinner which ended up consisting solely of boiled carrots...
538,"&gt;And he keeps asking if I can just be his friend and be human to him for right now

I'd reply that you are going to be as much his friend as he was to you when he was lying to you about the other chick."
539,"&gt; maybe I should have written this differently, it's not like she flat out refused to help w the directions.

Doesn't matter, doesn't change the fact that she was ignoring you and then blamed you for not communicating well."

541,"You don't need the reassurance, but I'd like to provide it: there is absolutely nothing wrong with you and honestly, there are 7 + billion people in this world, most of them living in substandard conditions. I don't think bringing more humans into this world is what is important.


I wouldn't take this situation personally. You seem fulfilled in career and your personal life. You have freedom to travel, buy fancy things, or retire early (if you save appropriately, of course). Also, you don't have to do anything for your niece of nephew if you don't want to ie changing diapers, feeding playing, etc. Although, the best part is, you get to interact with the baby then return him/her to the parents when you've had your fill :) 


I also don't know where your family got the idea that you don't like kids just because you are single and don't have any.... There is more to life than wanting/not wanting kids!!"
542,Why not? If he's hiding her from his wife he should feel guilty whether or not anything has happened 
543,"To the ""you don't accidentally"" that isn't necessarily true - At my college there's 2 different maths courses - 127 for life sciences and 131 for math/engineering/physics, and so on. He could have very easily taken the harder course for physicists vs the ones for life sciences"
544,"My first boyfriend hated when I painted my nails red. It turned into hating how I wore my hair or what clothes I wore. It turned into me becoming an anxious mess around him (and having been diagnosed with depression) for him to then decide that he didn't like how ""depressed"" I was. 

It seems small and petty now, but the little threats that change who you are and what you want to do will grow and you'll become someone you won't recognize."
545,"She was paid $10,000 by the family.  I'm assuming she had to be married for so many years?  Who the hell knows.  "
546,"I'm going to be honest with you: going through with a threesome you are anxious about is not going to do much for your self esteem.

Threesomes are great experiences when you go into them with excitement and interest and a very firm sense of your own self-worth and a lot of security in your relationship (if you are a couple adding a partner for purposes of the threesome). If you don't have that stuff they are unlikely to be a great experience for you, and there's literally no reason to push yourself to do it. It's not like you have a fear of public speaking and a job that requires public speaking and you need to push yourself through it to advance in your career or something. These things work best when you do them because you want to, from a feeling of security."
547,I find this less hurting than having no spark :'-)
548,"They're being ridiculous. If they don't like this they shouldn't be living in an apartment because it happens. You shouldn't have to ""modify they way you walk"" they need to just get used to it. I'd personally tell them they need to stop contacting me and bothering me about this, and get the landlord involved here."
549,"And you've only known him 6 months.  AND you moved him in with your kids?

I think him waving his willy about might be the least of your problems."
550,So she gets to tell him what he can or can not do to his body and reproductive rights? 
551,"Someone who can't be happy for you when you've found a great new job, and yet moans non-stop about his own work before and during your birthday dinner... is someone who sounds too immature and self-absorbed to be in a relationship."
552,"I can see why you would think that, but I think you're misreading it. I think she wants a do-over for when she's emotionally ready but not specifically expecting it. "
553,"&gt; . I can't see any reason why someone would yell at child they don't know in the initial stages of getting to know him.

16, small child messing with his phone. Especially if he hasn't been around little kids a lot. It's not that inexplicable."
554,"How have you suffered this asshole for two and a half years and why are you even considering moving in with him?    
    
&gt;I tried to come up with multiple compromises, all of which he shot down. I tried to explain how it made me feel, and how I felt like it would be unfair to me and he claimed that I was trying to manipulate him into stifling his expression, but it wasn't going to work.    
    
Gaslighting, google it. Sound familiar?    
    
**TL;DR Leave him**"
555,"Guests, pets? idk. Maybe he just had a posh wank and isn't keen to admit it."
556,"Why is it fair to make her feel unattractive and insecure? And, basically, feel pressured to start shaving again? Doesn't sound fair at all to me. 

What you like doesn't outweigh your partner's well being, and he should tread very carefully. In the end, he might just have to learn to like her body the way it is. "
557,"I agree with this.  OP, please get yourself some therapy, and soon, before the wedding.  Your fiance, and everyone on this thread, are right.  You are a victim of your family's narcissism and abuse, and your way of rolling over and taking it is not working.  You will destroy your relationship with your fiance if you continue to allow your family to abuse you.  

Do you plan on having kids ?  Do you want your family to shit on your kids the way they shit on you ?  Do you want to teach them to roll over and take the abuse to keep the peace, and let them suffer the way you have ?  If not, then make a change. 

You are starting a new life with your soon-to-be husband.  Now is a great time to learn to leave negative patterns behind, and build your family with him and your support network.  Read the books ""Boundaries"" and ""Emotional Manipulation"", because that is exactly what your family is doing to you.  Therapy will help you through this, please don't delay.  You need this so badly in order to be free of your family's abuse and move forward with your life with self-esteem and empowerment.  You deserve nothing less than this."
558,"&gt;  ""whatever you imagine happens, happened."" That could just be lap dances, etc.

Is this a joke.  You think by ""whatever you imagine happens, happened"", she meant ""private dances""?  I.e. something expressly and literally advertised as happening, legitimately?

You have to be being willfully obtuse here.  There's no way that's what you think the most likely implication of this statement is.  Perhaps she meant ""dancers taking their clothes off""?  Rofl..."
559,"He won't be looking for someone but he is moving along with his life and if you just stay put and have exactly zero ambition, he will leave you behind. "
560,"This may get downvoted, but has your fiance-to-be expressed a desire in those traditional values and the fact that she'd want you to ask her parents? It's a very polarizing issue because it can be seen as the daughter being ""owned"" by her parents, specifically her father.

If this is something you've discussed and I'm just way overthinking this... you've already gotten to know them and I'm sure they're well aware that you're on track to propose to her. You don't have to splatter your feelings all over their living room, but just approach them with something like ""As you two know, I am very much in love with your daughter and would be honored if I could have her hand in marriage."""
561,She wants to appear single on social media.
562,"&gt; He said he liked me so much at that time that he felt like I cheated on him.

&gt; the whole one night stand thing still bothers him to this day which absolutely crushed me

It is so gross that he has this mindset of 'a girl I'm crushing on slept with someone else and it's like she cheated on me'. Like huge red flag, the sort of thing they put in movies about crazy stalkers.

I wonder if you'd still feel so much anxiety about the one night stand if, after you told Joseph, instead of him screaming ""WHORE!"" at you he had put his arm around your shoulder and told you it wasn't a big deal and that you shouldn't cry and that plenty of people your age do things like that for maybe not the best reasons but you're still a good and worthwhile person. Just imagine if he'd done that. Then remember that he didn't, and he still isn't, and he probably never will.  "

564,"&gt; but her son gets married one time.

That is a huge maybe. 

&gt;Is she going to miss the mother son dance for this? 

So...a dance is now more important than a grandchild? Is that what you are going for here? Because that is hilariously untrue. 

&gt;Do you have any senior family members that could help talk some sense into her?

No one is going to claim that she should miss the birth of her grandchild. 

&gt;Ask her if she's willing to permanently damage her relationship with her future grandchildren over this.

Wow. ""Do what I want or I'll punish you! Tell me I'm more important than both my sister or my future niece/nephew or I'll damage your relationships!""

565,"Yeah, I'm '96 and turned 20 this year so there's no way someone born in 98' would be turning 19 this year. "
566,"For the record, I think his position is very relatable - just also really destructive and misogynistic. We have a cultural misogyny when it comes to female sexuality, and it's shitty, and most of us have to some work to transcend it. 

So I don't think the boyfriend is a horrible person for having these feelings. I think most 19 year olds would have at least a minor bout of them.

That being said, though, he needs to stop bringing them up. If he can't get over them, he needs to either break up with her, or just realize that, in this area, his feelings are his problem, and it is not okay for him to bring them up in ways that make her feel bad about her totally reasonable and normal and healthy behavior that had nothing to do with him.

Is the mortgage in his name or yours?? If yours, or even jointly, you should stay there. Have a police officer come help him get his things and leave tomorrow. If it is in his name, you need to leave ASAP. Go home and let your relatives help you. 

But regardless of where you live...make sure he is not there. This is life and death. Pregnant women are at increased risk of harm and death...and your baby is super vulnerable, too.

580,"Being frightened of aggressive behavior is a completely reasonable response. You are not overreacting; you asked him to leave your space and he did not.

586,"IA. If she is insecure, it'll probably put her at ease to meet you with your husband and kids first. It'll reinforce the idea that you are her fiance's happily married with kids friend. "
587,"Proposals should never be something unexpected or a surprise. The surprise of the proposal should be a when/how will it be question rather than an if it will happen question. Your position on marriage can't be a ""maybe"", it can only happen or not happen. It seems like from your post the issue isn't that you're having ""intrusive thoughts"", its that you've actually thought about it and you're sure now that you do want to be married. You said yourself, you would be disappointed if he didn't propose. The friend didn't ""plant a seed"" and that's why you'd be disappointed, it's because you have now started imaging it and really hoping for it. 

I think you need to admit to yourself and your husband that actually you aren't open to the idea of marriage, you really want it to happen. You also need to have an actual conversation about it and he should be able to tell you ""yes, I see us getting married"" or ""no, that is never happening"". The fact that you are in a limbo right now about a proposal shows a lack of communication. You wouldn't ruin any exciting plans if you talked about it, it should absolutely not be a surprise whether you will or won't get married."
588,"OP, this is important-- you need to stop doing this.  Not just because rude or boring, but because it's _bad for your health_.

At age 21, you still have _a lot of cognitive development_ you need to do.  Although your brain had a developmental spurt up to around age 20ish, there's another important spurt from 20-28ish, as you try to make higher-level social connections and make sense of complex systems in the world.

You are craving guinea pigs for a reason-- interacting with animals is nice and complex.

If you are spending 3-6 hours a day sitting around being understimulated, _this will impact your cognitive health for the rest of your life_.  Imagine making a 10 year old not move for that long while their body is physically developing.

Stop doing that, ditch this guy if you have to, and go out and have your own life. 40-year-old-you will thank you.  Also right-now-you, because you'll be less bored :-)"
589,I think it would be a problem for enough reasonable people that he should have the right to decide whether that's ok in his relationship before she does it.  If it is a problem she can freely decide between stripping and being with him.
590,"&gt; Should I tell her about the list? She's a person prone to feeling ashamed, and I don't want to shame her and stuff, but I have no damn idea how to approach this with her. She lied, and she keeps lying now, and I WOULDN'T leave her because of this number, but it's stressing me now, it feels like I've learned a dirty secret that can't leave my mind.

As you said, the problem here is the lying. Yeah, bring it up, since she won't tell the truth otherwise. And then, look at what she say from there on.

The number of previous partners may not be important, but honesty and trust is. If you can't trust her to tell you the truth when she feels that she shouldn't... Then you can't trust her. It's that simple. She may lie again in the future because of other things, she may even be lying right now, who knows?"
591,"To be fair, when you're surrounded by people acting like horny bunnies and you're not it it can get to you."

You've seemed to put forth a good faith effort to figure out a way to address this together but she seems unwilling to do anything about it.  I don't know anything else about your relationship but even if this is the only thing wrong with it, that would be a deal breaker for most people.  

Sorry man, 10 years is a long time, so naturally it will be hard to do if you go this route.  But really you're super young.  You both have plenty of time to find someone you're compatible with."
596,"You're a very possessive man for someone who didn't want to get married. You can't have her so nobody can, right? She broke up with you, you harassed her and abused her as if any opinion you have on her love life matters. She is not yours. You have no claim to her, or to who she can have in her house and when. She could have called the cops on you- you stalked her at night and called her to intimidate her.

Your Dad should have taken you for a mental evaluation, you don't sound emotionally stable or safe. Stay the hell away from her and stop trying to extend your ownership- it's over. Leave her alone before this escalates and you end up in jail."

598,You are one lucky fellow that you can go 8 hours without pooping every single day. 
599,"&gt; To me, this is a non-issue. ""Was tempted, chose marriage."" Will happen in every marriage. 

Yes, but something happened to the point where the girl felt comfortable inviting him to her house to shower. That's past was tempted. That is seriously leading on someone else/gauging their interest &amp; only backing out when it got too ""real"" &amp;/or an emotional affair. 

Op sounds like he is downplaying the seriousness of the situation and only putting the fact it proceeded to this point &amp; coincided with the aftermath of a miscarriage down in the comments.

He wants us to agree it wasn't so bad.... but it was bad, and if he wants to save his marriage he should probably recognize and accept that fact. "
600,"I think what you're asking is selfish. You are looking for the standard ""Your girlfriend is being unreasonable"" response, and she isn't. Her concerns are 100% valid and I think you need to level with yourself on this one. You can't gripe about having to change plans you should have made in a completely different way, and then have the nerve to ask whether you should try to tell her your side and make her feel bad for feeling uncomfortable. You're in the wrong here, dude. Let it go. "
601,"Your brought a stripper into her house with any thought to if she would like that, without letting her know, or asking if it violates her boundaries with her husband-to-be...?

I would have kicked the stripper out too. 

Yes, she overreacted with the screaming, but you also messed up. What you did was likely highly disrespectful in her eyes. 


"
602,"No, you would've been pushed out of the room because all of you and your family would just be in the way PHYSICALLY of the medical professionals who's job it is save your wife and baby's life, you being there wouldn't have done anything.

Again, doesn't matter. If by some miracle she DOES forgive you and has another baby down the road, for heavens' sake LISTEN TO HER."
603,"You're allowed to feel however you feel.  Feelings are never not allowed.  So if you're upset, allow yourself to feel that.  

Now as to whether your feelings are reasonable, yes, in my opinion it is reasonable to feel like you and the kids have been last minute abandoned.  

Btw, huge mistake to tell your wife you were okay with her going, when you didn't really want her to.  If you feel caught off guard by a request like this in the future, just ask for some time to think it through."
604,"Voluntary individual therapy still won't work if he's not going to own up to his behaviour. For therapy to work, there needs to be some kind of cooperation between the person receiving therapy and the therapist and he would need to be willing to change. He doesn't sound like he even sees an issue with his behaviour."
605,"&gt;You never need the other person's 'permission' to break up with them. 

Right? At that point it becomes a hostage situation. "
606,He honestly sounds depressed combo-ed with some social anxiety. A therapist would help greatly.
607,Would you be ok if he just fucks other girls without emotionally involved ?
608,You have to tell Ryan the whole truth. Whether to tell his sister is a trickier question.
609,"&gt;I'm looking at my empty ring finger

Getting engaged/married doesn't change the amount of say a partner gets to have on what you do with your body. It's a commitment, not a receipt.

Personally it's been three months and he didn't express his concerns in an even slightly reasonable way, *and* he sounds possessive even outwith this. I'd take the job but keep an eye out for something better. Or move, if you can - I know you moved to live with your sister but if a town's best options are bikini barista or $10 a day cleaner... It doesn't sound great."
610,"Bro… don't get played son. 

She is waiving red flags left, right and center. "
611,He'll never be successful as a doctor if he's that negative with his patients 
612,"You're not engaged if nobody knows about it and you aren't getting married in 5-7 years

Like seriously this is super high school

Scrap the engagement and just enjoy being together. This is embarrassing to read."
613,"My friend had a similar problem. She was a succesful dancer, she was winning all the drama competitions in the country and she wanted to be an actress. But her parents told her that she has to find a better major. Finally they agreed to see her in action (they never saw her shows before) and they realised that she's really talented so they made a deal. She would apply to 3 best art schools in the country (smaller than the US so I'm not saying it's right for you) and if she's not accepted then she'll be a speech therapist (kind of connected to being an actress, let's say). And guess what, she got accepted into the most prestigeous one and now she makes a living out of being an actress in theatres and doing some other stuff in the meantime. Don't give up. And work hard to be the best in what you love. "
614,"Hold up, are you supporting this ""professional musician"" while he is in a ""dark place"" because he can't find ""satisfying work""?

If so wether you think this his explanation is justifiable or not (and a lot of the thread is voting not) you sure as heck should not be supporting his lazy self. It's called a job, he should get one while he is pursuing something more fulfilling. Barring that he should be so busy working towards what does fulfill him that he doesn't have time to make craigslist ads.

Serious question, is he sad he did it, or is he sad that you caught him and he might lose his mealticket while not working?"
615,and OP is a full *ten years older* than his teenaged girlfriend :/
616,It's thoroughly questionable she won't just tell them to fuck off rather than going out to at best waste a bunch of her time and theirs. At worst...
617,When did you become exclusive?
618,"After you're married, yes, why do you expect her to move into the house that you bought?  It is _your_ house.  She does not want to live in a house that was specifically yours, no matter that you want her to have input on decorating it once you're married.  She wants to have picked out a house with you."
619,You don't want to deal with disability/SSI in Arizona. I saw friends do it and it was hell. AZ is not kind to people who fall behind and do not have savings/family to be their safety net.
620,"Well, apparently he is not too old to get stupid crushes. No doubt he is trying to play it down, but so far there is nothing that says cheating - and if this is the only time he has done something like that, I would let it go for now but keep an eye on it."
621,"Wow dude. Your a Reddit legend. I'm honored. Your Neo in the Matrix in terms of dodging bullets. 

But my advice would be to get a restraining order. There's no reason you should even talk to her. I'm glad your stepping away. 

It sounds like she still regrets what she did after the action but when it was happening she was fine. Now she wants to send a baby pic of another Kid thinking it'll be fine. I'm glad your not thinking of going back. 

Go to the police man. "
622,I'd call that a drinking problem. 
623,"So, when your girlfriend is unhappy, she doesn't want to have sex, when she's generally kind of happy, she has average sex, and when you make her especially happy, she has great sex.

These things are not weapons, this is your girlfriend's bodily autonomy. You aren't owed sex of any quality. These are just normal human moods, normally affecting her normal human sexuality. "
624,"What confuses me about the ""meta message"" is: what's deemed 'allowed' for a fling? One can't be infatuated with someone on a short fling? Only stoic sexual relations allowed? You can like them but if you make them feel *too* good it's your fault they want to continue the relationship? Calling some things ok to do and others not because you might 'lead them on' is nonsensical. All she can do is tell them *with her words* what she wants. If they don't listen that's on them, and it's the risk they knowingly engage in when starting a fling with some who outright tells them they don't want a relationship. 

Hurt is inevitable. In all relationships that end. Flings, long term, monogamous, poly... being hurt doesn't mean someone did something wrong. It doesn't mean OP was lying to them or acting wrong. It's a natural part of relationships. You feel it and you cherish the good times and you move on. "
625,"So she doesn't aspire to be anything in her life or accomplish anything, it makes sense to spend that energy on something tangible: being ""someone"" in a fantasy world. I wonder if she would play less online games if she focused on *doing something* in the real world, like a job or a creative pursuit? Something that she could be good at and feel like she accomplished something? "
626,"I mean if she can't use her legs, then she can't really do much else now can she?

But I can also see it the way you took it ... and you know ... being her age, that's kinda normal I'd say. Takes gals a a bit to realise they can move in the bed too :)"
627,"Hey OP,

Just putting out there that exercise is great for getting healthy in general, but losing weight is 80% diet. And if you're eating healthy, i'm more wondering if this is a metabolism issue for her, or if she should see a doctor?

But she says: this is how she looks, and she's okay with it. Its okay for you not to be. Attraction is really important."
628,"i mean, i think there's a difference between being a picky eater and forcing your choices on others. it doesn't really sound like OP's girlfriend is forcing him to eat what she's eating, or preventing him from going to restaurants he wants to try (if she is, then it makes more sense that he feels the way that he does). it sounds like she herself is not adventurous, but like she's willing to go to a restaurant and order the same thing while he orders whatever adventurous thing he wants to from the menu. 

idk. i mean, i've seen it from both sides. i'm married to a guy who's a pretty picky eater (in the grand scheme of things), but we go to restaurants and he'll just order what he wants or sometimes he won't order at all. if i make food and he wants some, fine, if he wants to make his own food, fine. we still eat together, we just eat different things. what he eats doesn't affect me at all, and, sure, while he may never know what this one dish that i really like tastes like...that's okay? i'm okay with that? there are many, many other hills to die on. 

that said, i do know a couple where one partner is extremely picky and gets ""offended"" if the other partner eats foods that she doesn't like in front of her. seriously. so, obviously, in that case, one person's food choices ARE affecting the other.

i just don't think this has to be the kind of thing that affects you unless you want it to. if it does, that's fine, it's just not something that's inherently a problem in most relationships."
629,maybe the Fiance didn't get his sister a present so she screwed another guy?  
630,"He was in the house and had originally lead housemates to believe we had invited him. There definitely was an element of panic and paranoia though, you're right."
631,"Yeah.. I mean, I understand she's choosing to do this, but it isn't fair. She sounds responsible and prideful to a fault, to the point where it's seriously undermining her responsibility to herself. If she wasn't living with you, she almost certainly wouldn't be living beyond her means to this degree. 

I wish I had a book or article to recommend that might help convince her that she's actually doing the opposite of what she intends.. idunno. There has to be a good book on finances in relationships, I'm just not aware of it.

*ETA: Maybe try assuring her that she'll have an equal say in decisions if you split things proportionate to income. You're partners, and you don't begrudge her this, as you consider her an equal in every way, and appreciate her desire to contribute equally. But you feel it's unfair for her to extend herself to this degree keeping up with your lifestyle together. Follow through on the equal decisions thing.*

My SO and I have an income disparity. Early on, I always insisted on dates/vacations that were free or affordable to me. He would suggest restaurants, events with tickets, or trips I couldn't really afford, especially not regularly. He won me over by insisting (repeatedly) that he wanted to have that experience with me and was more than happy to pay. He very much enjoys doing the free/cheap stuff I suggest, but didn't want to be limited by it. We do both now."
632,"&gt;1: Is it alright for me to be upset that she hooked up with this guy the day after telling me she didn't want to date me anymore?


Did you guys actually break up? even if yes, No, you can't break up with someone, have sex the next day and the nexter day ""work out things""


&gt;2: Even though I am upset about that, and nervous that she will decide in another year that she wants to leave me again, I still want to at least try to work things out with her, I do still love her, and I don't want to have my daughter see her dad and mom split up again.


It's not possible with her



&gt;3: After finding out that her friend set her up with this guy, and was the main force convincing her that I wasn't right for her, I told her I no longer like her friend, this obviously upsets her a lot, is it right for me to not like her friend?


She decided for herself, her friend had nothing to do.


&gt;4: Am I crazy for still wanting to try to make this work...


**FUCK YES**"

634,"I always try to look good when I see exes and people from my past. It's not that I want to be attractive to them, it's more that I want to show that I still look good after all that time. It's point of pride I guess. I'm not going to see someone after several years and look like a schlub, I'm going to knock their socks off. I even have visions of showing up to my high school reunion looking like a rock star. That's never happened but you get my meaning."
635,"Maybe I do. But I really don't think the place for a nervous and aggressive dog is in a house with strangers. I initially tried to be friendly with him and sometimes when the owner was around, he'd let me pet him. I think it's bad judgment for her to bring him there in the first place and then refusing to admit that his behavior isn't normal. He tried to bite a cat once too for moving too quickly."
636,I think a lot of people go to events or concerts on NYE which may be sold out. I know a few years ago I went to a local bar and had to buy my tickets in advance.
637,"Children are family too.

You are trying to host a family dinner without inviting the whole family.  On christmas eve no less.  

Honestly, you just shouldn't ever host if that is the way you feel.  "
638,"You're getting a lot of flak for this. I feel like it's kind of offbase and unwarranted to be honest. You're totally allowed to feel how you feel and want what you want without people telling you how stupid your reasoning is. I think it's not a good idea to get married before *you* are ready (and not when people say you *should* be ready or your reasons for not being ready are stupid). 

But here's the thing: your gf has the right to feel how *she* feels and want what *she* wants too, and she has the right to change her mind about what those things are whenever she wants. That's how people work a lot of times--most of us change in ways we couldn't have anticipated or expected. 

The way your post comes across is that you think she reneged on the deal and you want her to get off your back about it. But aren't you kind of doing to her the same thing these fine people are doing to you? They're saying ""What you want and why you want it don't make sense to me; therefore, you should change your mind about what you want"". How is that not exactly what you're doing? 

I'm not saying you should necessarily propose on her timeline. But nowhere in your post do I see you trying to understand her point of view or motivations, or trying to reach any sort of compromise. What I do see is a lot of ""not what we discussed"" and just shutting it down.

I'll be honest and say that if I were her, and you didn't somehow leave out the part of the story where you actually talked to her about how she felt, I might be having some serious second thoughts about marrying you. The way you sound in the OP--and this is your story, that you wrote, and most people tend to skew the story in their favor at least a little bit--is that you're inflexible and more interested in The Contract then how she feels about getting married. "
639,"What are you comfortable with doing? In other words, where do you draw the line at what constitutes ""sex"" that you wouldn't do.

I dated a Catholic woman for a long time and a big part of the reason we broke up was she had incredibly unrealistic ideals of the role sexual activity plays in relationships, and, quite frankly, I couldn't deal with her whispering in my ear ""We're practicing before god for the union on our wedding night"" while holding my junk...repeatedly...and her pulling out a bible and quoting it whenever she wanted to avoid intimacy. Do you do things like this? "
640,"So here's the basic truth about the whole no sex before marriage crowd, there's a definite ""window"" of opportunity there. People either get married before they're 25, or they end up having sex before they're married but there's very few who end up drifting into virginity into their late 30's who are going to be able to find partners willing to wait til marriage.  You ask if you should give up on dating.  No one can answer that for you.  The chances are, the man you are looking for isn't out there.  The wait for marriage willingness is a mindset that most people abandon in their 20s and you will be hard pressed to find a man willing to entertain it in his 40s.  It's probably not going to happen.  So you don't have to give up dating, but you should recognize the reality is that the odds don't favor you.  If you date, maybe just date to meet nice people, have a nice time, without the expectation of ""forever"" and kids, and relax.  Who knows, maybe you'll have a more enjoyable time on dates if you aren't viewing each one with an eye towards marriage. "

645,"You have moved from ""friend"" to ""stalker"". Let her go."
646,"&gt;that doesn't mean that there's necessarily anything deliberately abusive in what he's doing

Doesn't have to be deliberate to be abuse or to harbor the effects of abuse."
647,You need to read his previous saga. He needs a restraining order. 
648,"That's complete bullshit. He doesn't get to set the terms for how to resolve a massive breach of trust like that. You are the victim, and you have been generous already in giving him another chance. Couples counseling should be mandatory and he better throw his heart into it. If he won't go, or agrees to attend but just marks time without taking it seriously, that will tell you exactly how serious he is about repairing your relationship."
649,"That's a pretty uncommon scenario, though. Like, until this thread I'd never heard of it before. "
650,Wtf this is hella toxic. Just move on. From both of them. She broke up with you for the hundredth time and is free to see whoever she wants. But the fact that they probably had the least an emotional affair prior to you guys breaking up makes it hurt so much more. Sprinkled with a close friends being that other guy just intensifies the pain of losing someone you loved. But... Cut your losses. Don't stalk. Don't call or text her. Don't call her any names. Don't be bitter or resentful. But it sounds like you already burned all bridges when you went back there and called her a liar. Just move on.
651,"She doesn't need your support.  She needs the support of therapists and family counseling.  She NEEDS to get her house in order.  It's too far outside your paygrade to try to help her.  If things are escalating to the point of abuse allegations, then they need professional assistance.

If you support A, you're going to end up alienating B because you'll be seen as supporting A in her allegations.  If you do keep in contact with A, keep it superficial until she gets the help she needs.  "
652,Stop the car. Tell them you're not driving if they don't have belts on so they can buckle up or they can walk.
653,"Look up the term ""gaslighting."" that is what he is doing to you. he is abusing you. If the way you described last night was truthful, he has no right to be mad at you. he is trying to convince you that you are a bad girlfriend in order to change your behaviors. You are being abused."
654,This. You don't need to tell them the whole story. Just say this guy from school has been acting really weird around you and to please tell you if he shows up at the house or anything seems amiss. I've known people who have arrived at their parents house to find them serving tea to their stalker who said they were expecting him. Don't leave this stuff to chance. 
655,"What a terrible and selfish thing to do, OP. Take ownership here. You very likely DID cost this girl the job opportunity. You messed with her life because you were too inconsiderate to reply to a damn email.
If you were too busy to give a reference, it's up to you to tell her immediately so she can find someone else in a timely manner. She was probably desperate, and you were horrible. How dare you come here looking for sympathy- you owe that girl a genuine apology and dinner (on you). "
656,"No, he doesn't have a college degree and he has a very good reputation in his industry and is well known.  He really loves what he does and is good at it. He's not the type to be in an office, and he wouldn't be nearly as good at any other trade. He's been doing this since he was 15. He could potentially go into similar trades, but there's still risk there."
657,"A man who makes misogynist jokes does not respect women. You're a woman. Don't put up with this bullshit and don't let it slide. If he's not  a decent human being by the time he's 34 he won't ever miraculously turn into one. Take a stand, go and never look back. "
658,"The point is he is not compromising either and is trying to hassle her about her not wanting to see his mom and dismissing her very valid concerns as silly. I did suggest a compromise in my main comment, that being ""live and let live"". They come to an agreement, he can see her a total of x times a month/year and can spend on her/give her y amount of money maximum. She doesn't guilt or hassle him or shout at him or threaten divorce if he stays in those agreed boundaries, in return he respects that she does not want to see the woman herself or have her in her home and stops pressuring her to do so. That's the only way this is going to work. Why should the wife sit through lunch with a smelly dirty person that physically repulses her? "
659,"I hear you. In the grand scheme of things kissing seems minor. But it's not really about kissing, is it? It's bothered you enough to write here so it must be something that weighs more heavily on you than you might be willing to admit.

You know why? Because his actions (or lack thereof) show disregard for you. He might not mean it to, but then it's because he doesn't know how much it's hurting you. 

Kissing might not seem like a big deal but making you feel loved and happy is and should be a priority to him.

You know how you can talk about things without *really* talking about them? Talk to him again. Explain just how sad this makes you. If he really doesn't want to kiss maybe there are other ways he can show you affection and love that will make up for it for you. Think about those things and talk to him. Look him deep in the eyes and explain it.

I believe in you!"
660,"Nope. He's a nice dependable guy with a solid job who will make a great husband...for someone else, who actually wants to be with him.


You gave it the good ol' college try, OP, and it didn't work out. This is actually what dating is for, to find out who is and isn't a compatible partner for you, so congratulations on a successful dating experience! Now dump him kindly but firmly and stay out of his life for the rest of time. He will sad but will move on and find someone else, as will you."

662,"You need to immediately tell your mother all of this, and I would never again be alone with this man, and anything but distant from him is too much.

Your gf is other extremely manipulative or has some serious mental health issues or both (probably both).  She is not a healthy person and you are not a dr.

As you are starting to see this is not a healthy relationship for you. At 18 your relationships should b fun and pretty carefree with only minor conflict and drama.  This is off the charts."
674,"In the grip of depression, you may be aware of what you're doing, but you'll misinterpret the emotional intention behind your own and others' actions. It creates a sort of dissonance and unawareness of your own motivations in the moment.

So I think both sides of this argument are correct, with the distinction in the middle being that your actions while depressed aren't necessarily your fault, but handling the consequences is entirely your responsibility. And if you fail to handle them properly then yes, you are at fault."

It's another to share a home with someone and lie about paying the rent on time, while also being sent to collections for various items.  Especially if this other person is in the dark and you're planning the rest of your lives together. 

You guys need a serious talk about finances, take home pay, where money is being spent, and how he's going to fix this. Build a budget together.  Look at what can get cut and what is necessary.  My boyfriend and I did this and it's helped us save a ton.

Also, maybe take over paying the rent so he has to give you his portion and you know it's paid on time."

That's not even remotely what's happening here. 
He doesn't have to *feel* respect for her traditions or things that are important to her, but if he doesn't *show* respect she doesn't have to be his girlfriend. That's how that works.

&gt;What? Where has he tried to stop her? He's told her he doesn't like it. He wants to change her mind, not restrict her right to her own body. Jesus.

lmao stop reacting as though I suggested he kidnapped her and tied her to a radiator to preserve her pristine skin.

He told her he doesn't want her to do it, that counts as trying to stop her doing it. He didn't just say ""I don't like it but it's your choice""."
680,"I'd assume she's just making a fun suggestion and might not be entirely aware of your intentions. I would say maybe something like, ""I was hoping maybe we could get to know each other a little better and figured coffee before the concert would be an easy no pressure way to do that"", or something along those lines. I wouldn't assume anything about her text however. I doubt she would say ""coffee still works for me tho"" if coffee didn't work for her.

You're attracted to Brad, and he's clearly hot for you, no problem, break up with your boyfriend and move out, once you've done both things then start banging Brad.

You've been test driving Brad and that's not cool, it's obvious he wants you and he's been manipulating you to get what he wants.  You've handled this so badly that I think you should break us with the BF and move out, even if you don't want to date Brad, now that you understand that he's pretty scummy, by trying to snake you.  You've been pretty scummy to your BF so maybe you deserve someone like Brad.

685,"I'm getting a lot of mixed-messages from this post.

Having a mature, equal relationship isn't actually something really special and out there. *Lots* of girls do this. It is *not* rare that a girl is caring in a relationship and that a girl helps financially.

And yeah, even women who are less attractive than you can have relationships where someone treats them well. Why wouldn't they be able to? This has never been about looks. ""Better"" looks do not make someone a better person or a person who inherently deserves more than anyone else.

I'm saying this because I think this attitude is part of the problem. Because you believe this is something special and rare you don't bat an eye when your partners also believe this too. But that fact that your partners don't just take this as a given and a normal thing is part of your problem. This kind of man is not likely to act how you would like.

You want men who *don't* think this is totally mind-blowing. You want men who *expect* an equal relationship: because that's fair if you expect it from them. And, yeah, that's going to make you feel less rare and special, but it's going to mean that the expectations in the relationship are more realistic and your partner will be working with you from day one.

Can you give up that feeling of novelty to have a relationship where you have expectations upon you, too? A lot of people thrive on a feeling of novelty and get ""addicted"" to it and keep seeking it out even if it keeps hurting them. You are not alone.

You need to find partners who *expect* things from you. You need to be less willing to give until you bleed for nothing. You need to hold each other to the standard of being decent people.

And... yeah... the age gap? It's not a total dealbreaker. I have a relationship with an age gap like that! But if you're having this problem... it sounds like he can't put in effort to a relationship and all the women his own age are probably sick of that. He's with you because you are putting up with it because you think this is normal. Because you have a bunch of unhealthy relationships that you're looking to as examples and counter-examples that have lead you to believe that a healthy relationship isn't common.

Look for examples of healthy relationships and expect *that* instead of looking at people who create drama get shopping sprees. Like you said, that's not what you want. Surround yourself with people who have the lives you want to have. If you do, it will probably become easier for you to figure out how to get there too."
686,"Reread the post. He didn't say he got an instagram ""this morning"" . This morning was when he responded to the question. "
687,I had to work a full year for a weeks vacation..
688,"Oh hon. Don't confront him immediately if that doesn't feel safe. Make a plan of action. Would you like to move back? Do you need enough money for a security deposit on a room in a shared place in your current state? Ask your friends and family for help, whether financial, logistical, or just emotional. "
689,"Ok guys, its not called mass. Which I should probably know since I went to that church when I was a child. Mostly I just remember the icing-less loaf cakes the old ladies made for the breakfast before service. They were the bomb. "
690,"I mean what you did was pretty irresponsible. And there is no way for your bf to have proof the truth. 

As far as who's right, there is no way to tell. If you're not lying about being unfaithful, then it's either your ex or your current bf putting the deed on you. 

And honestly there is no way to know that. Find out which std it was? If chlamydia, it could stay in the system for a long time without symptoms. Other stds usually present with symptoms. That would make the situation a bit clearer I guess. "
691,"I asked that he talk to me before he do anything and I wanted to know if he was talking to guys before he did it. 

He wanted to meet up with them they were all attempts to meet up. I have no idea if they did or exchanged phone numbers ... I know people leave them up there on craigslist. The parts I saw were just chatting but they all had the intent of meeting up. "
692,"Still don't get it. If people overheard you, how come the story only surfaced years after the fact ?
You're totally within your rights to just forget about it. If Mark's story is true, you were the victim of an assault. You don't have to do anything but protect yourself. 
"
693,"This is silly. She's not going to keep herself from dating because of a pact she made when she was a tween. Things change, people grow up."
694,"Someone who *really* wanted to insure a future with you wouldn't be all wishy-washy about marriage talk, or take a job so far away without consulting you.

Sounds like you two will drift apart painlessly.  No need to spend money on airfare, right?

When you say goodbye, really mean it!  Then go on and live your life. "
695,[deleted]
696,"yeah no there are streamers like dyrus who even incorporate their SOs into their streams. it seems like he's embarrassed?? which is fucked up. that's shitty. if he thinks he'll get flak from his chat for having you on stream, he needs to grow up. anyone who does give him shit for it is probably a dumbass kid anyway.

talk some sense into him. you could show him the example i mentioned, dyrus, to explain that he's being a weirdo about it."
697,So how much does Kate know about Jane? When you two discuss dating do you talk about Jane? Does Kate know you're in a committed relationship?
698,"This is really insightful. If she didn't have the guts/didn't want to seem like the bad guy, this is the perfect plan to make it seem not her fault at all but him finding out about it ruins that. "
699,And that must be why you were still single at 29. 
700,"Then start getting a bit more serious about it. Explain to him that not only did you lose weight but kept it off. He has gained it. Ask him that if he can't show that simple of a commitment he asked of you that you did keep, what kind of other things could happen that effect the future? 

How can your relationship remain stable and healthy if he cannot bother to put in the same effort you do.


As another note, maybe try and ask if something is killing his motivation to go to the gym. There could just be some emotional event that happened he is not sharing with you for some form of fear at you finding it silly or something.

Communicate that you want him to show the same commitment to being in decent shape he asked of you, but thay you also wanna help him with finding that motivation to do so and wanna provide support. Things like that can really help people open up about why they won't actually go through with something."
701,"Depends on the state, the age of the teenager, the nature of the custody arrangement etc etc 

If it's written into the arrangement - most states won't allow a minor (of any age) to refuse visitation if it's court ordered and will hold the parent in contempt. Others require a formal amendment to the custody arrangement. If's a recent divorce and NCP decides they want contact, they can sue for it and courts sometimes extend visitation rights and refusals to extended family members so they can sue as well. Some states take in a kids feelings on visitation but some states don't. The list goes on.

It would cost OP not a lot to talk to her lawyer. Pay for a bit of advice and OP could avoid a massive headache. And even if it's fine - if the NCP decides to sue for any reason, this is relevant information her lawyer should know. There's no harm in informing her lawyer. "
702,"Yes, I know what can help you...re-read the 5 Love Languages.

Seriously...your story reads so much like a case study from the book I almost feel like you're just joking with this post. 

Your love language is Words of Affirmation. His is Acts of Service. 

When he doesn't give you words of affirmation, you question his love for you, which he is showing you through acts of service, because that's how he expresses love (and probably receives it, too). "
703,"Honestly, I understand your husband's love languages way better than I understand yours. He's showing you that he thinks about you and prioritized time with you (coming home right away after work) and your preferences (e.g. letting you have the better slice of pizza).

If asked to say why I love my husband, I'd struggle. There are tons of things I like about him, but even if those things went away, I'd still love him, so I wouldn't say I love him *because* of those things. I love him because I love him. For example, if I say I love him because he's strong, then does that mean I love him less when he's sick? I certainly hope not! But if I say I love that he's strong, I feel like I'm also saying that I don't love him as much when he's not feeling well.

It sounds like you need to learn each other's love languages. Teach him specific phrases you would want him to say, rather than getting him to come up with them on his own. Maybe brainstorm with him things that would feel authentic.  You may have to do some role-playing with positive encouragement, to get him used to saying the words."
704,"&gt;And then when he said he didn't have feelings for me, he didn't even apologize or anything. He knew I was in my room alone feeling completely heartbroken but he didn't even knock on my door to talk, he just left me home alone in our big house while he went out to the bar with his friends.

Oh boy. You are infatuated with him and it is unrequited. He is trying to establish boundary. You shouldn't expect him to apologize for something he didn't do. 

&gt; I feel like no one is ever going to like me.

So this is another issue. I used to be like that too. I would recommend you take a good night sleep and then talk to a therapist. You can't handle being a friend with him. You need to cut contact and even move out.  "
705,"Yep. Also, sometimes guys can get all butt hurt and act like jerks if you push them away in a bar or something. It can be safer to play along until you can get away in a situation like that.  "
706,"Can you think about this from the perspective of the woman? Some guy she has interacted with a few times at work asks if she wants to bone, no strings attached. Sounds like a recipe for a sexual harassment lawsuit, or a very stern talking to from HR. "
707,"So every parent should be respected by everyone, just because they're parents?

Not sure where you're getting this ""if she dislikes his mom she dislikes him""... is OP also an obese, unclean hoarder who is taking advantage of their kids? 
"
708,"I mean that first thing isn't really his choice, and there's plenty of people who don't party and do fine.  Not participating in an alcohol-fueled hookup culture doesn't mean that OP is living under a rock."
709,"Since he only does this doing competitive, I can't get up and walk away since I'll punish myself and the team (it's an auto loss if someone leaves), but I think I'll just complete the game and calmly explain that I don't want to play anymore until he can play nicely, and go do something else for a while.  lol "
710,"It's one thing if they just treated her differently, but the fact that they're trying to pressure their daughter, basically this girl's adoptive mother, to do the same is absurd.

If it was just the different treatment on their side, maybe it'd be reasonable to suck it up. But the fact that they want her to be treated ""less than"" her siblings is horrific. And their behavior only seems to be getting worse. Sounds like it's time to pull the plug on the relationship until they can either learn, or at least pretend, to be decent people."
711,"I agree. If he didn't tell her and she finds out, she'll think that the OP is okay with cheating and then she might think he'll eventually cheat. 
"
712,"If your cousin is coming to live with you, there is probably a very good reason for it, that is a grown up reason that you aren't being told about. He probably doesn't have anywhere else to live. Something really really bad may have happened to him or his family.

I understand that you don't want any change in your life, but sometimes you have to make sacrifices to help out other people. 

This guy has probably been through some terrible things. Try to check your attitude and welcome him and get to know him. He won't be a stranger for long, so instead of making him the enemy, try to make him a friend. 

You don't want to pile on top of whatever horrible thing has already happened to him. "
713,"When I was about 10 years old, my favorite friend to play with was 4. She was my neighbor across the street and everyday I would come home from school, run across the street, and ask her mom if we could play outside. And that is all we did for two years until her family moved away. 

The girls down the street from me who were my age were boss and bullied me - I had no interest hanging out with them. But my friend 6 years younger than me liked to run and pretend and dress up just like me, so age wasn't a factor. Also, communication levels didn't bother me. I might have done more of the talking, but we always had fun! 

I just wanted to let you know this so that you could see it from the other side. Kids, even girls, sometimes don't care so much about communication either if they are having fun. And I'm sure my friend's mom appreciated that her daughter had someone to play with - there were only a couple of other children on our street that were that young.

"
714,Take his door off it's hinges.  And apologize to your wife for laughing.  And make your asshole of a brother apologize.
715,None of that seems to be considering her opinion on this house.  You seem to weigh that because you did those you get to just buy a house. That's really not how it works.
716,"I hope he listens to you, I had to do this to an overly critical family member. Once the criticisms start I hang up the phone. You have to learn to stick up for yourself and not in a passive way. Tell your parents they should be glad you are dating at all, you are probably their only shot at grandkids.

Also is there anyone you can fix your sister up with? Is she still living at home at 30? I guess I kind of feel sorry for her, she probably always compares herself to you and feels like a failure. "
717,That's unnecessarily rude. 
718,that was a good thing to say. i wish happiness on everyone but sometimes i think it doesn't get through
719,"I hope you look back at these comments in the future and find them embarrassing. I really pity you - only able to find self worth in being a guys side piece - is that really how you want to live? You don't need a boyfriend or friends to love yourself and be happy. People gravitate towards confidence, maybe you should try developing yourself as a person. "
720,"How about you don't. You are 27, and it is Facebook. Who even cares. "
721,"I don't know one person who thinks a wedding is more important that a birth. I got married last year, I'm having a baby in a few months. The baby is 100% more important than my wedding day. You did have choices and you made them. You can't be angry at your mom for making her choice. Don't let this put a damper on your wedding day. Move on and enjoy your day. "
722,"Someone else mentioned this already and this is a new perspective I haven't thought of...

Trying to impress other people by lying is one thing, but sacrificing our relationship by going long-term, with a risk of breaking up, is definitely a big aspect of the whole story...."
723,"I was specifically thinking of when Megan wanted him to move to California with her and he stayed back in NYC ostensibly for work, even though he'd lost his job. Same kind of scenario: flying back and forth, lies about where they are, who they're with, making up clients/professors. After Megan finds out, she says (I'm paraphrasing), ""So you just woke up every morning and chose not to be with me?""

Lying aside, that's the thing that would personally stick in my craw the most about this whole situation. LDR is *hard*, and OP and his fiancee did it for four years! And it was a lie! "
724,"As a general rule, no. If someone needs to be told that, they're not going to be receptive to hearing it, and it's just going to give her ammunition.  "
725,"If that's how it works for you guys, then great (don't want to sound sarcastic there, I don't know how else to say it)! I don't know why he wouldn't just say ""I'm going for a few drinks"". As long as your assumptions are not taken advantage of."
726,"I disagree entirely, playing with your daughter for (I guess combined would be about) 3 hours is plenty for one day. Thats 3 more hours than a father that doesn't give two fucks. Don't be so quick to judge.

Secondly, this kid could be one that simply loves attention. This is more likely to be from being a child with split parents than a father who doesn't spend enough time with his daughter. (which, judging from just the one Sunday here, he does)"
727,"Others have said it, but I'll repeat it. 

Separate your financials as soon as humanly possible. Speak to your landlord about breaking the lease as soon as possible. 

Cut off all ties from him as soon as possible. The moment you can do so, block him on all social media, block his phone number, and filter his emails. 

This man is a very convincing liar. He is very, very good at evoking feelings in you, in telling you what you want to hear and believe. Every minute you spend in contact with him, every conversation, puts you at risk for more manipulation and lying. Treat him as if he is radioactive; stay away and do not handle without a heavy lead blanket and safety personnel standing by. 

&gt;*Why the fuck do I still love him so much?*

Because part of what he did was make you fall in love with an *idea*, with a *future*. He led you into visualizing a future, creating a dream that would someday come true, and that's **powerful** stuff. The thing you're still in love with, the thing that still calls to you are those castles in the sky he helped you build, that shining promise of tomorrow and beyond. That's the thing you're not giving up, that's the thing you're going to feel grief over. He sold you a 'happily ever after' that won't ever materialize. 

You're numb right now, because the enormity of what's happened is still being processed. His behavior is so far beyond anything you've ever seen a human being do that it's simply boggling. You will feel sadness, and grief, along with rage and embarrassment. 

But right now, **right now**, your #1 priority is getting to a place where you can safely and completely cut off all contact with this man. You **cannot** heal or become whole until that happens. "
728,"Ignore that person. They are taking the piss out of you.

I don't think they understand that you had reasonable trust in your wife. Why would you nickel and dime her if you trust her? Answer, you wouldn't. 

However, knowing as you do now that she's received and hidden god-knows-how-much money from you for years, that trust clearly was misplaced.

And that is where the pain and the shock for you lies.

The first step now is to find out how extensive the lies are. You can't heal anything until you know the size of the wound."
729,"You can't get him to forgive you.  He has to want to forgive you.  At this point, it doesn't seem like he wants to.  Don't be surprised if he moves out and breaks the lease.  

Frankly, you violated his trust.  At the first hint of an improper text, you should have shut it down immediately.  If you aren't getting the attention from your boyfriend that you want, then you need to communicate with him or break up.  Take these lessons into your next relationship, because this one is likely done."
730,Match.com you only get set up with people who match your ideals. And it has a huuuge database of people. And is well known for having people that are seriously considering marriage. And You can do a month free trial. I don't think it would hurt to try.
731,"Of course you aren't in the wrong.  He knows he behaved like an asshole and is more than likely upset that you were a nice human and made him look even worse, that and the fact that he was ""exposed"" to all your friend group as being a shit boyfriend and person.  Just give him space and ignore it. "

733,"He has been with heroin longer than he's been with you. He cares about heroin more than he cares about you. He is not going to keep any promises not to use when he's around you, because he is an addict. You can pretty much take it or leave it, you know?"
734,"Ooh, if you have any female friends that use OkC, ask to see their inbox. You'll get a better idea of what it's like to be on the other side. It's just a constant barrage of sexual propositions (like, so many) and it can mean that good messages get lost in the creepy. Don't take it too personally if you don't get a response."

736,"When there is mutual respect a partner will never shame/coerce/manipulate/berate or be rude to the other partner for saying no to sex. You don't owe him anything because you are married. His behaviour is completely out of line. 

You should talk to a therapist together about this issue. He clearly isn't listening to you, maybe he will listen to a professional who is 100% going to tell him he is wrong in this instance. "

739,"It's totally alright not to like these people because they're assholes. 

And it's great that you're open to changing your views a bit. 

However, the reality is that a poly relationship is just like a regular one, except with an extra person. And especially to your friend, it's perfectly normal. 

So, while you may be uncomfortable with her girlfriends, your friend is likely interpreting this as you being uncomfortable with her. She's not asking you to join in, and she's not asking you to approve. Just to accept that it is what it is.

To be honest, ""what am I supposed to tell them? That I'm hanging out with you but they can't come?"" is a damn good argument. What *is* she supposed to say to them? ""My friend is uncomfortable with the number three?"" Frankly, if she had been in a normal relationship--even a lesbian one, just with two people--it would be considered incredibly rude for you to deliberately avoid meeting her SO."
740,"Reality is, you're dating their daughter, I'm pretty sure they know that. Four years is a long time. Asking this question is actually going to be a relief to them so don't make more of it than it is. Also, remember, you're asking for their blessing, not their permission. You're an adult, their adults, approach it as such."

743,"People are so stuck on ""I'm not actively harming lgbt people therefore i am not homophobic!"" when you can absolutely have ""casual"" homophobic thoughts. 

OP, this does not mean you're a terrible person. It means you have some illogical fears to work through. I think you'll realize a lot of your fears are based on harmful stereotypes that you've been exposed to all your life. There is still a huge stigma that being bisexual is wrong or dirty or that they can't help but cheat. These things are just not true.

You know your girlfriend, she's the same person.  YOU are the one she's chosen to be with. Just because she is attracted to multiple genders does not mean she's going to ""need"" that experience! It simply means she can look at a hot girl &amp; be like ""nice"" the same as a hot guy. That's it. Attraction is not something you are compelled to act upon.

You CAN break past this issue if you try. You need to do a lot of introspection and perhaps some research to get the fear out of you, but it can be done. Figure out why it bothers you and realize what false beliefs you're holding onto.

If you simply accept this as a ""dating preference/dealbreaker"" like so many recommend here, and leave it at that, your homophobia will remain and it will continue to bother you unnecessarily. If you explore your fears &amp; conquer them by learning the facts, I guarantee you'll feel a lot less conflicted!

Good luck."
744,"I do not think the fertility company is going to talk to this woman's daughter about her private health information without permission, or let her talk them out of providing services to this woman as if she has no agency of her own.

They worked hard the majority of their lives to save money, then their adult daughter who has no intention of ever working or earning money expects them to hand it over to fund her dream wedding. Fucking LOL. And your siblings are right, if you and your fiance can't pay for the wedding yourselves then you aren't ready to get married. By all means, do whatever you want to do with your life, but don't go around saying you don't want to work and then ask people for handouts. "

Find a new job and switch as soon as possible. Technically you could sue her for the work you have done (since you're not getting equity you're an employee) but I doubt you want to do that.

I'm always angry at her too which what few sessions I could afford they stressed to me that I shouldn't hold it against them.

But let's not clear the op of all wrongdoings - he did Stop flirting, but many people are able to go through a rough patch in their marriage without turning to another romantic interest. He shouldn't have flirted, and he knew he was doing wrong by his wife. He even hid it, to avoid facing the consequences of his actions. This isn't what I'd consider 'doing the right thing'. "

761,Giving head to my really hot fwb is sexually exciting but involves no emotions. I just really like looking at his abs and giving head. I'm sure any boyfriend I have would happily accept that explanation when he finds out I'm still giving him head after we agreed not to sleep with other people. 
762,"Yeah I was thinking about this. This isn't any different than talking poorly about your girlfriend behind her back. What you say when no one is looking is the truth is what I believe in and well, you found out the hard way it seems. "

764,"3 months ago a drunk 22 year old crashed his car into my house. The wall he crashed into fell about a foot away from where my puppy was sleeping. He missed a load bearing internal wall by about a foot. When he got out of his car, he tried to light a cigarette and I stopped him and he called me a bitch and stomped off to smoke while I called 911. 

Drunk driving is not victimless. We are about $3k out of pocket right now on our deductible and other incidentals that we are waiting for insurance to cover. We had to live in a hotel for 2 weeks. I developed pneumonia from the dust created by the drywall and insulation. 

We saw the kid in court last week. We overheard him tell his lawyer that he didn't see what the big deal was because he only cracked a couple bricks. We know where he was coming from and we know how many houses he passed before he crashed into ours. Hundreds of people were at risk from this guy on a 4 minute drive. Every other car on the road was at risk of being hit by him. Your boyfriend PURPOSEFULLY put however many lives at risk because he was drunk and because he DID NOT CARE if other people died because of it. It was a willful disregard for the lives of every single person he drove past. Everyone is very lucky that he didn't cause an accident or kill someone else. 

This is not something light. This is not something that can be brushed off with an apology. If he does not acknowledge the severity of his actions, then he will almost definitely repeat them. And keep in mind that depending on where you live, YOU could be held criminally or civilly liable for the damage done with your car. "

767,Why does it have to be about credit and ulterior motives? Why can't he just do something with the goal of making people happy? 
768,"Agreed. 

I have had relationships where some girls did not like ANY other girls being seen as attractive. Some who did not care, and others who would banter about it. 

The ones that were jealous and had to pretend no other women even existed didn't last long. 

The ones that would joke about it, or you could openly talk were much better experiences. 

My wife will often point out an attractive girl to me ""OMG her legs"" as we are walking through a shopping centre, I turn, look and sometimes say something corny. 

Vice Versa, if I see a guy thats attractive I might say ""Mr Flex at 3 o'clock"" she will glance and say something. 

Just because you are with someone and ""in love"" doesn't mean you suddenly have to find everyone else unattractive. It isn't some biological switch that flips when you change your relationship status on facebook. 

Much more fun to just be comfortable with each other. 

edit. Downvotes because me and my wife are comfortable with each other, and easily trust each other and can have a joke without getting jealous. /r/relationships. Where a healthy relationship should be downvoted if you yourself feel jealous. Because better advice would have been ""OMG that is the worst, I never let me man look at another human being"""

770,"&gt; Was it really right for me to expect them to set aside a whole special day for making me feel special about it? 

I'm not talking about expecting people to deliberately *set aside a whole special day* for you. But it's not *wrong* to want to shine a little bit. 

This is precisely why it's generally considered uncouth and an example of poor social etiquette to propose at someone else's wedding or why people get bummed out by having Christmas birthdays. Everyone wants a day or a special occasion of their own. 


&gt;Or to actually get upset because other people have good news too? That seems...downright unhealthy to me. 


I don't think anyone mentioned  getting upset, but I still don't think it would be unhealthy to be *disappointed*. "
771,"Totally agree with all of this. I lived with some inconsiderately noisey roommates and I have work early, so it was constantly an issue. What they really couldn't comprehend was simply changing their behavior to be quiet: That if they simply picked a different room to talk in, I wouldn't have to come out and yell at them. Just making small changes add up a LOT."
772,"It is hard to single someone out. However, if one of her friends would cancel this year, and he would be able to go. What is the status quo then? Would that friend lose the opportunity to go in the following years? Miss once, and your out? Or would OP be uninvited again for year after?
It seems that the event is like a yearly trip taken together. In that case if you want to, you can discuss getting a bigger rental for future or something. Honestly life isn't something stable. Things change, people change, relationships change. Can't ignore that, even if you want to."

777,"OP, you work in a specific field and it's given you the one lens to view old age with. My great-uncle (who died early this year in his 80's) was riding motorbikes into his 60's, and took up mountain climbing when his wife died. He had a full, rich, independent life right up until the end. 

Also, I suffered from depression for a long, long time. I did not see myself getting to 25, I did not see myself getting to 30. I did not see myself getting to 35. And I hit all those and am nearly at the last one. You can hide from life, but it will come for you. Time isn't a tap you can will off.

Which makes it difficult to address certain issues."
782,"You seem quite unstable. I'm someone who definitely would be similar to your husband. I give my wife the best of everything.

I value your preferences and it makes me feel unique that I can act on them. I am willing to lessen my happiness in the moment to make you happy because that in turn makes me happy."" I also trust my wife to return this love in her own way. I have my love language but I still enjoy hearing hers. You're missing the point about many of the ways he is showing his love. You're only seeing silly Italian food. It's not about the pizza. "

789,"**Make it definitive**

Honest to god, this is what i did. So if it doesn't work for you, so be it, but it worked for me. 

I walked into his office and asked are we getting married? Yes or no. I'm fine with either, but let's decide. Got the yes. Okay, I am going to make a folder with rings I like to give you some ideas. Okay, he said. Not before the end of the year, he added, because Christmas and whatever. Fine by me, makes sense. Here are some rings, let's talk about what I like in jewelry. Awesome. I knew it was coming eventually, not at the end of the year, and then I waited while he found a ring and then on the most random-ass day, with a cocktail in one hand and wearing pajamas, he proposed. 

Fucking. Awesome. It was super sweet, I was totally surprised, the ring was beautiful, the whole thing was perfect. 

YOU CAN DO THIS TOO! Just ask. Are we getting married? Are plans in the works? Could you please not make it a big Christmas surprise if you have plans in the works? Can we talk jewelry before the big reveal? If your answer is, ""I don't know, I'm still mulling"" that's totally okay! I respect that. I can live with ""I need more time"". But when you come to a place where you do know that we're either going that way or not, please clue me in. Don't just shove a ring at me and yell ""SURPRISE!"" It's stressing me out and I just want to have a vague glimpse at the game plan. 

**True story** before this, when I knew we were getting engaged but not the when or when-ish, we went out for an anniversary dinner. I SWORE it was coming. Nope. So I just sat there a jittery mess the whole night, he's wondering when I decided to down a pot of coffee since I am vibrating off my chair, and then it becomes clear it's not happening. The awful sinking feeling was...well...not fun. And it wasn't his fault because it was all in my head. And it wasn't my fault because it made sense in a given context that I won't explain, and it just ended up being a not-so-fun night and I had to explain to him why I was in such a weird mood. That's when we nailed down some time-frame boundaries. That helped a lot. 

So...you don't have to undercut the surprise or the romance by etch-a-sketching an approximate timeline. You'll still be surprised, it'll still be romantic, but you can save yourself a lot of unneeded anxiety if you just level with him.

791,"I would never apologize for something that I'm not sorry for, just to placate my wife."
792,"Well, the point of dating is get to know someone well enough that you can be reasonable assured she's not just going to up and divorce you.  If you both are honest with each other while dating, put effort into maintaining the relationship, and establish healthy boundaries and trust, the chances of you winding up divorced are slim.

And no, most relationships do not end in divorce.  For a wealthy man in business, I would hope that you are better at understanding statistics than that.  It makes me wonder how competent you are in other areas of your life.

You cannot ensure that the future happens perfectly.  It's literally impossible.  Your marriage might end in divorce even if you do everything right.  The stock market might crash and you lose your job.  Your house might burn to the ground taking all your posessions with it.  The next airplane you take might fall out of the sky.  The next meal you eat might be tainted and you wind up deathly ill.

You still run a business, own a home, go on airplanes, and eat food.  Marriage seems to be the only place you're hung up on ""Well, but it might not be PERFECT.  Something might go WRONG.  I don't want it if I can't ensure ABSOLUTE PERFECTION.""

795,"If it's not affecting your life in a negative way then you don't need medication.

ADD is something that many people have but don't take medication for because it's not needed. By the sounds of it, you weren't aware that you may have ADD which leads me to believe that it's not negatively affecting your life or learning so much that you need to resort to medication.

Also, not many people refer to ADD as a mental illness. It's a mental condition yes, a disorder is another term used with it and in some cases can need medication to overcome but it is not widely considered an illness per say.

Him:  Nah, I thought you could come over, I was going to play games.
 
You:  Oh, no, that's okay, if you're going to play games, I'll make other plans. I'm not interested in just sitting there, watching you play games. We'll make plans another time. 
 
Him:  What? No! Come over, I really want you to come over.

You:  Great! What can we do together that doesn't involve games? Would you like to go for a walk, or maybe we could play a board game?

Him:  Well I still want to play games, but I just love having you there. Please? Come on. 

You:  Well I won't be coming over just to watch you play games anymore, that's very boring, and I have better things to do. I'd love to do something together as a couple. But if you want to play games, that's fine too, I can make other plans, no problem.

Him:  Look, how about I just play for an hour or two?

You:  I appreciate it, but unless I make the choice, I won't be coming over unless we're doing something together, or unless I have a Netflix show to watch while you play. Other than that, I won't be at your place while you're playing video games, as it's hurting our relationship and it's incredibly boring and frustrating to me. I just won't be doing it any longer, and it's not up for discussion or debate.  

Him:  *pouting*  No! What's your deal? Just come over! Stop being such a weirdo!

However, you still live with your parents and they are spending their time/gas driving you around. They also have some parental responsibility about teaching you good financial behavior.

Was there some kind of agreement about how you were going to spend your money? Were they okay with driving you to/from work if you were saving that money for college, for a car, or to move out? Was there an expectation that you were going to talk with them before you made any major purchases? 

As an example, it sounds like this was an expensive tablet. Was it enough to buy a cheap used car? For your mom, this may have been a better use for your savings. She still probably would like to be consulted before you dropped a substantial amount of money.

He is manipulative, selfish, dishonest and lacking in empathy. He doesn't trust you based on his own guilty conscience. With that said, I think /r/LearnedFoolInGold hit the nail on the head that this is familial pressure changing his mind again. They want him to have a kid and he may be desperate to please them. 

If you don't go forward with his plans, that offers the potential for him to further manipulate the situation in his favor. He will likely speak poorly of you behind your back and tell everyone how cold and unloving you are for not giving him babies while carefully neglecting to tell people about his decision not to have kids in the beginning. Your husband may have wonderful qualities but I don't see how anything good about him can outweigh the negatives you've presented here. You've said yourself that you will likely end up taking on the task of raising the kids (at the expense of your time, career and sanity) by yourself while his routine remains the same, and if that's true then you'll spend the rest of your life resenting him because you could have found someone else who genuinely wanted to do that TOGETHER. 

No matter what the religious or cultural repercussions are, it's not worth it. "
825,"I'm slightly confused here, so your nephew says he got a medical card to use marijuana (which I 100% am in support of). 


So if he has his medical card and you're in a legal state how can he be punished for having thc in his system when showing up for jail time? I get being caught obviously driving under the influence of the drug but even that is pretty iffy. Thc can stay in the blood stream and you can test positive for it anywhere from 30-60 days depending on how regular a person uses it and what concentrations. So if he had a med card and is in a state he's licensed to purchase and use medical marijuana as treatment for his condition one could expect him to test positive for it when he'd show up at the prison. And even when he'd be pulled over initially. 


I'm thinking either we're not getting the full story or maybe you aren't... and I'm kind of leaning towards the second because what reason would you have to lie to a bunch of internet strangers. I'm confused on the circumstances of his dui's and how he got them. Was there no booze involved at all? If so how and why was he pulled over? How did they test him? Did he have his card when he was pulled over and tested? If so how did they prove that he was under the influence while driving and that the thc in his system wasn't just from proper use of his medication? And why if he is prescribed and has his card is he in trouble for showing up with the thc in his system to check into jail? We're missing some information here and I think you are too. "

839,"Just in case we lose the post:

&gt;Jack and I have been married for a year, together for 6 total. I really do love him, and we get along great for the most part. One way we don't exactly mesh well is our preferences for travel. He's not a big traveler, I am. While we were dating, we went on several trips together, and every single one ended up horribly. He'd want to sleep in late, go back to hotels early. He never wanted to do anything too ""touristy"", but never did any research of what he did want to see. He'd suddenly become a very picky eater and not want to try local cuisine, he wouldn't want to go out at night, he never wanted to do any sort of sight-seeing that wasn't guided by a tour. On top of it all he would just be in a sour mood the entire time. It was awful.

&gt;So this year I took matters into my own hands and booked a trip for myself with a friend. It was places that I've always wanted to go that I knew he had no interest in, and it was only for two weeks. I told him I was going out of town for a while, he agreed, and I was off.

&gt;Well, shortly after I got back he found out the trip was for leisure and got incredibly upset. He accused me of lying to him (I really didn't) and that I had stepped ""outside the bounds of our marriage"" by not including him.

&gt;I really don't think I did anything wrong. He hates traveling, so I traveled without him. I don't demand to go along to bar nights with his guy friends, or tag along to any other sort of activity he doesn't want me a part of.

&gt;What do I? Did I really screw up that badly? I don't see how us spending a little bit of time apart is really that horrible.
