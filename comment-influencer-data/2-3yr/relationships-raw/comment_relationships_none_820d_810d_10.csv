0,"There's taking the high road and there's being passive. High road: ""that's not a kind thing to say, aunt. She will be in the picture because she's family and that's that"" what you did was sweep it all under the rug. 

Your husband should not be fucking up your aunt but Jesus. This is a fucked up family you've got and I feel pained for your daughter"
1,"They should also install more in areas off the kitchen of this is how they're deciding to live. 

God, they're going to kill someone. "
2,"Now, i'm 24 and have horrible anxiety when it comes to driving, this is why i do not have my DL. 

However i'm at least trying to work towards it, i at least offer gas money even for a five minute drive, I at least feel like the burden i am for letting my anxiety hold me back.

Steve doesn't have his priorities straight, and steve cannot rely on his friends forever to be a free ride whenever and wherever he wants. Just say no or ask for gas money. Don't go out of your way to take him to places just because he is bored. Only offer if you wanna chill with the guy, if he needs a ride to the DMV, doctor, or job interview. (Still press for gas money though.) "
3,"Therapy. Seriously. It's no uncommon for people (usually women) who wait until marriage for sex have an unhealthy relationship with it before hand - and then end up like you, feeling badly after sex.

I doubt those couples you see actually have a perfect sex life. 

Have you tried talking to your husband about this? He can't change his behavior to make you more comfortable if you don't tell him. "
4,"Having spent the entire last week in the car with my daughter watching daniel tiger, I both CANNOT and am yet thrilled with you right now."
5,"I had an ex who actually sent me an article supporting a view point that women should be soft, meek and mild. So when we get aggressive, male minds see us as male and act accordingly. With force. So don't be surprised ladies, when you yell at your man he sees you as an equal man and will hit you. So keep that in check so they won't have to! ^/s

W.T.F."
6,"It could very well be a generational difference... many older people do not fully understand nor appreciate the very close relationships younger people have with their phones. Lots of older people only use their phones to make calls, or text a few times a day. These people wouldn't mind if their phone was out of sight for a few hours, or even days sometimes, and this genuinely would be a harmless prank to someone with that mindset.   
That being said, the father in law knew that he was on thin ice with the family. Whether this was his idea of a light-hearted joke or not, it sounds like its time for a formal all-family sit down discussion with you and your husband, his mom and her husband, regarding what is bothering your husband, and what type of relationship/behavior is expected from the parents if they hope to maintain a relationship with your family and baby going forward."
7,Which is a fucking _feat._
8,"Is it unreasonable for you to ask? No, absolutely not. She is majorly invading your privacy. 

However, coming from a girl whose mom was just like yours, it's highly unlikely that she will change her ways. If she believes it's her right to be in your business, there's little you can do to convince her. When I was 16, my parents were insufferable about invasions of my space. However, I can say that things changed radically when I was around 18 and now that I'm 20, our relationship is great. 

As for now? All I can suggest is to buy a lock box for your important personal items (such as birth control) and try to remind yourself that freedom is not far off. "
9,"People are being too nice to you, sorry. But are you fucking serious? You make 50 grand and live with your parents at the age of 32? No one is playing the long con of gold digging, lmao. 

You've got serious maturity and life perspective issues to think this is an appropriate question not to get ridiculed for. You've been so sheltered you're desensitized too craziness. 

We've all got your our issues, including myself. But I feel like you don't have friends who'll be honest with you...you need on get a grip. "
10,"When she is able to spend time with your daughter is she loving and engaged, or is it just a grudging thing? Because it sounds like her mother might be struggling with some heavy stuff (or just unable to pull her life together) and that's taking a real toll, but there's not all that much you can do about that.

Is there a way you could set up like virtual time for them to be together? Even if it's just a nightly phone call or whatever, just to maintain presence and contact?"
11,"At least he's stepping up.

Can you elaborate on the ""asshole"" bit?

I'd hate for you to leave one abusive relationship to pack up and move right into another."
12,"Well, for a start, no more showing baby pictures. That would be a trigger for anyone in your mother's position. 

She needs to see a grief therapist. She has gone through a significant trauma. I would have your father bring it up to her- he knows her the best and should have a better idea of how to frame it. "
13,"The actual weight isn't the real issue though... if it was a real problem it would be fine for her bf to say ""hey, I'm kind of concerned about your health, I think we should make some healthier choices together."" No, he puts her on an emotional rollercoaster always changing his mind and makes her feel horrible about her body. The real issue here is that her boyfriend is abusive, and that won't be fixed by losing some weight."
14,I'd leave him. But I have zero tolerance for idiots haha. 
15,"Have you considered he's apprehensive about it as he's never lived with you? You're in your late 20s and live by your parents rules, it's not really surprising he hasn't asked you yet.

Do you work? If you're interested in marrying him maybe talk to him about potentially living together. Yeah your parents would probably be upset, but if they cut you out for something like that in this day and age they're shit people.

I really dont think he's to blame for this situation."
16,"Not a comment on the interpersonal situation, but I have some things to maybe try to help your mom eat...

- Meal replacement shakes. Ensure is the best known brand, I like the Glucerna kind bc it screws with blood sugar less. Regular chocolate is usually the only flavor that's decent, and off brands usually have a weird texture. These are good because there's no prep, so she can take advantage of it if she suddenly feels like she could eat something. 

- Smoothies! When I'm trying to get calories and nutrients into someone that isn't eating enough, I load up a smoothie with avocado and peanut butter powder (bulk section). If I want more fat or protein, some coconut oil and regular protein powder. Then throw in a bunch of spinach and frozen berries, maybe a banana. I like almond milk as a base, but ref milk, coconut water, apple juice, etc all work as well. "
17,"I don't think you're being unreasonable considering you two have been planning to go for three years now, and you both decided this summer would not work.  Is there a meaning to the guys trip, like a bachelors thing? If there's special meaning, maybe you can make both work. Is there any way you both go go two weeks before his friends, then he can stay for two weeks with the boys?"
18,[removed]
19,"I don't have all that much self-confidence. What I do have is the ability to live my own life outside of the shadow of my parents. OP has that too.

The rest is actually a very good point, thanks. You're right, she'd need to make that decision for herself and not only for this particular relationship."
20,Don't give your emotionally unstable husband a firearm. He needs a good chunk of therapy. He's just being an asshole to you and using his mental illnesses to justify it. 
21,I'll never understand the point of these fraternities and sororities. The only things I've ever heard about them involve people doing seriously stupid shit. Why on earth does anyone get involved with these shit shows in the first place?
22,"Repeating from another comment - they actually know everything she does. They either think he's wrong for kicking her out, not answering her calls, not seeing her everyday, or they blame her truly crazy moments on PMS. They're clearly manipulated by her too. When my boyfriend first learned they'd been pushing her to move to his city and that she wanted to stay with him a couple weeks while she job hunted, my boyfriend called his dad to discuss it, and his dad actually said, ""Please, just take her for two weeks. We need a break and can't deal with her anymore."" yet they still give him shit for being ""rude"" to her."
23,"When someone shows you who they are, you believe them. An apology doesn't change who he is. It doesn't make him a responsible adult all of a sudden. It just makes you get off his back.

Dump his ass, and try to find someone you'd *like* to have children with. Have high standards when it comes to marrying someone."
24,"I think she's just subconsciously responding to pressure.

It may be partly that a lot of the language she uses is copied from others in her social circle and they all have babies. Is she quite socially conformist?

But the pressure is coming from within as well - it seems like some part of her wants to be pregnant or at least wants to talk about it on some level."
25,Is your mother Catherine Debourgh
26,"My daughter tried latching on my collarbone, her dad's nose, and yeah, she's an optimist but it's very common for babies to do so."
27,"Yeah, this is like serial killer behavior..."
28,"It's petty. Look, I only have half-siblings (a whopping 6 of them) but I call my mom's kids my brother and sister because that's what they are to me. I've never specified that with anyone except my therapist because it matters there. I've grown up with them. The rest stay half because they're not in my life. 

You may be right, but you're mean. And you're clearly doing it to hurt and punish your mother. "
29,"You say you're​ not socially inept in the slightest, but your story says otherwise. You need to apologize to your friend and their acquaintance for being a jerk. I'm sure the podiatrist worked hard to get where she is and the first thing you do is shit on her career choice? Jesus Christ. Check your ego, suck it up, and apologize."
30,If the parents honestly *need* the $1600/month that OP is contributing- then they basically need a full extra income. Not many people are able to just give away $1600/month. 
31,"It's the weirdest thing if you try to describe it someone who's never had this done to them. You got a ""gift"" but the gift itself never mattered, it the meaning behind it, which was totally taken away from you, and then you feel shitty about not being excited about the gift... but whatever YOU were supposed to get out of it, was taken away so that the giver could be a big hero. If your sister tried to tell that story to her friends, it would be like ""he said we wouldn't go but then we did."" ""So what's the problem? Spoiled much?"""
32,"""Hey mom, remember when i was 2 months old and you didn't take me to see the fireworks? yeah, what's up with that?"" "
33,"Are there other instances of this whole 50-50 split thing? This seems pretty messed up and unrealistic. He says you're a bad wife and he is reconsidering having kids now because you dont do three chores as often as he wants? 

Look, there are a lot of issues here and a counselor would be great even if he doesn't want to go. You're not a terrible wife, his expectations and actions are ridiculous. His temper tantrum indicates some real problems in his expectations in a partner. The fact that he even went so far as to criticize you as a wife (and indirectly as a future mother) for really minor stuff is a huge problem. 

First of all, stop calling yourself a terrible wife because you are not. Don't do it as a joke or bring it up at all. You're not a bad wife but you're inadvertently giving him permission to agree. Second, tell him to knock it off with the passive agressive bs until he's actually ready to talk about things in a constructive manner. The kid and house talk goes on the back burner until this is resolved. By resolved I mean you both communicate your problems, effective change has been made, and expectations are realigned. Stand your ground."
34,"This is wrong. They caused him to be abused in the worst ways possible. This is harsh, but they are evil. If they could not see the evil of their actions then, they never will be able to because they are too indoctrinated to ever question their beliefs. 

There will be no closure, only further abuse. While it is normal to want to have your family love you, that is not the situation here. OP is asking a family that abused him to love him. That is not possible. OP, do not do it. No contact them. For your own safety, please."
35,"You're right, I have a lot of trouble being direct when I'm upset. I've got to work on that. However I do think he knows I'm upset and just avoids me and doesn't text me at all, sometimes for over a day  (usually he will text me, sit next to me etc). 

If I were to talk to him about it, how would I do it in a way that won't lead to awkwardness or making him feel like I'm accusing him? "
36,You went on a date while having a gf of 6 months- that's a big issue
37,"I agree. Sometimes you need to be a realist about certain things. Seems like she would be much better off with her child's father and with an insurance plan than alone halfway across the country. 

She would have had to leave school either way. Seems like a no-brainer. "
38,"Do not block his number on her phone. How controlling are you???

Use your words. Talk to her, tell her you are uncomfortable with how friendly she is getting with this guy. 

Are you a jealous guy at home though? If she went out with guy friends (even guy friends who may like her) would you be as paranoid? Or is it the holiday? Many people on holiday like to be social though, and you would be having breakfast anyway. What does some company hurt if you have rest of day together? 

Are you wanting everyday just the two of and no one else? Maybe you need to consider what she wants too...? 

Also, not to feed  your fears, but your view that he is less good looking than you is just that. Your view. If you stand side by side then it is likely some people will prefer him to you, worth remembering that. Maybe girlfriend finds him attractive (maybe not as much as she finds you) but is liking the attention as you two have been together a while. 

Talking in circles with random ideas, but basically just talk to her."
39,There are zero good reasons to be an anti-vaxxer
40,"If anything being on Reddit has showed me that there are a huge number of enormously insecure people out there who expect their SO to run every tiny little social situation like them lest they assume cheating is going on. In a healthy relationship there is trust, not automatic assumptions that alcohol plus the opposite sex = bad news. OP was asleep when her bf came home, she probably didn't immediately think to go 'oh hey, I had so and so over, we had a few drinks', and his reaction is incredibly over the top, controlling and paranoid. "
41,"From the gym standpoint, talk to r/bjj or r/mma - this isn't an uncommon concern for us older people who take a first amateur fight or competition. 

The real gap though is that your wife is listening to this friend more than she's listening to you. "
42,As someone with anxiety...this is exactly how OP should deal with it. 
43,"I left my first husband because I woke up one day and realized I didn't like him very much thanks to about two years of emotional abuse that was moving towards physical. Didn't give a single thought to trying to fix things or begging him to be nicer to me or promising to do better as a wife so he wouldn't be mad at me all the time, just called my mum, set up an apartment, and bounced a week later."
44,"&gt;I don't want to tell anyone the truth about the verbal mindfucks or the girls, or the messages because in all honesty, he is a great person to know otherwise. He's their family, he's their son. He's a great friend, a great uncle, a great guy. He's just a terrible partner. He doesn’t know how to love and respect his partner. I'm also embarrassed to admit I was so weak and so stupid. My parents raised me better than that.

OP, I don't want to assume what you're feeling, but I wonder if there isn't some pride at work here.  You don't want to admit to your parents how bad it got, because it's kind of humiliating.  

I don't think you deserve to feel humiliated, by the way. I think you are a loving person who tried beyond what a lot of people would do. But being treated like that makes you feel so low sometime that you assume everyone else will see you that way. I have been in that place with my parents, and they actually really surprised me by being completely supportive.  

If your parents are decent people, let them in. You don't have to let them all the way in, you don't have to give every last detail. But they might surprise you.  

And for god's sake, you have given your ex enough. You do NOT owe your ex your family and friends too. He is a grown man who chose (underline that word: *chose*) to be an unfaithful, verbally abusive dickhead to his wife. He's a big boy who can live with those consequences."
45,It sounds like they leave those kids at home by themselves on the regular. Letting a dog's toenails grow like that can cause damage and infection in their paws. They probably don't have money because of drugs. Please don't second guess yourself until something horrible and irreversible happens. Go call. You can do so anonymously.
46,"I think you might have to be a little condescending, or as I prefer to call it in this situation - realistic. You were perfectly fine living on your own before him. In fact, based on the price of housing there it sounds like you could pretty easily afford to live on your own with the other roommates without him. I think you need to let him know he either needs to be proactive in this search, or get with the program, because you are not going to let his hang ups stop you from moving to a place that works for you and your budget.

Maybe if he starts looking and seeing that 1br places would be more expensive than paying $550 - which is less than 14% of his income - he might get with the program.

Has he offered *any* solutions or is he just being negative"
47,"Yeah, I saw the hair today and it finally made me think really hard."
48,"So much clarity...this needs to be higher. It's not about the money at all. It sounds like he wants to grow your relationship, which after two years at 25 and 27, it's normal to want to live with your SO on your own. "
49,"&gt; he doesn't feel as close to me and doesn't feel the want to be intimate in ways such as hugging or kissing. He pretty much just ignores me most of the day because he is pissed at me. 

In your situation I would not feel like having sex either. Your relationship is currently devoid of intimacy, emotional and physical. For him to want you to have sex with him after ignoring you all day? Come on. That would make me feel like a sex doll. 

The situation that you've explained sounds untenable. You need to sit down with him, outline what you think is necessary to get things back on track and hear what he has to say. "
50,"So, to answer your question about what you can do differently: you could do a better job communicating your plans and timeline.  Instead of figuring it all out on your own and expecting your wife to just be able to go along with it, you need to tell her ""I want to go to X, to do that we'll need to leave the house at 5:15 to make the show.  Can you do that?""

It sounds like your wife is busy dealing with kids and her job, and isn't making your relationship a priority.  If she asked about this I'd give her a lot of the same advice, but you're the one asking so you get the advice.

1) Relationship counseling is great if you can find the time and a regular babysitter for it.

2) Read up on emotional labor and see if your wife is doing most of the planning, scheduling, communicating, and household management.  In my experience, if you each think you're doing 75% of the work, you might actually be splitting it evenly.  You planning a date night is great, but if she's busy planning everything else then she won't have time or energy to plan date nights.

3) Try to get a regular date night (or date afternoon on the weekend, or coffee and walk through the park) set up.  Even if you don't manage it every week, having the default be to get some time alone together.

4) Does your wife get kid-free time to herself to relax?  If she's mentally / emotionally exhausted from dealing with work and kids all the time, she might not have any energy left for her relationship with you."
51,"Yessss. You are too old for urban dictionary. Also she moved across the country and back with you, she prob would have already divorced. Get a therapist ensure you have a weekly date night. He can't break up your marriage if it is a good one. Put passion into stuff outside work and spend 1 night a week looking for a different job."
52,I agree with you about them being able to afford a housekeeper but I think the root of the problem does not stem in that.
53,"I wouldn't say it's just for the kids. The kids play a large factor and we probably wouldn't be together if we didn't have them, but we are also very compatible in a lot of ways. I'm focusing on a lot of bad in the post obviously, but there's been good a lot of good too. Besides this horrible thing she did she has been a great mom. "
54,I have 0 idea how Steph found out. She just came clean to me this morning and told me what happened. I never asked how she found out.
55,"&gt; . I highly doubt you can gleam any sense of my behavioral patterns from one sentence. That one especially. 

Don't make presumptions on what I can and cannot perceive based on what you think you are safely hiding or are not aware of about yourself. It didn't ""have"" to be someone's idea to open the marriage, most marriages are never opened, you know that right? It was your idea to open the marriage yet you were the one who got insecure about it, as I already perceived was the case.

I think my read on you was right on the money, but maybe it would help if I were explicit. You appear to be a selfish man concerned only with his own desires, you minimize your flaws and dismiss the idea that they have contributed to your wife's dissatisfaction, and blame her for the marriage failing as if you did not contribute. You are continuing to ignore her feelings - she says spend the money on bills, did you even ask her if she wants to go to marriage counseling? Did she tell you she didn't, and you are planning on it anyway? Maybe a good place to start is why you don't believe your wife should get a say in what she wants to happen in her own life. "
56,"If he's been traumatized by a previous relationship, it's on him to get therapy or whatever to deal with his feelings. It's not fair of him to project his insecurities onto you, a perfectly innocent person who hasn't harmed him in any way."
57,"I'd show him this post.

Like someone else said, it sounds like you're dating a 15 year old. I'd be embarrassed with all those things too."
58,Asking the real questions. 
59,"&gt; It's a dagger to the heart, and saying such a thing that way is another way of saying, ""You'll never be attractive"". Fuck that.

I disagree entirely. In my opinion what you've said makes as much sense as telling someone ""You're poor"" implying ""You'll never be rich"" which makes little sense (but is more obvious that it doesn't make sense). Someone can be poor, just as someone can be ugly. However, there are things in both scenarios you can do to improve your situation. We're not all dealt the same hand in life and have to make the best of what we have to work with."
60,"Your mom needs to get angry.  M is now using the school to bully your sister and that has to stop immediately.  There's nothing to be done about M's false accusations but I recommend your mom hire an attorney to send a cease and desist letter to the school.

In the letter, I'd insist that all events and organizations be open to her and suggest that the school do a better job at investigating accusations before parroting them.  Add some language about how inequitable treatment could lead to further action against the school.  The lawyer should be able to craft a suitable letter for a reasonably low price."
61,"Right???? He has no room to talk, he pursued a 14-year-old!"
62,"You were in your early 20's then. You probably have a much better understanding of yourself now, as well as a better understanding of what you need in a long-term partner. Most early twenty-somethings are looking for someone to have fun with. Most mid-late twenty-somethings are looking for someone to build a life with. "
63,"First off, congratulations on cleaning yourself up and changing your life around. 

With that said, it's obvious what she is doing. She wants to reach out and talk to you. I do not know the history, but I can assume it was toxic and chaotic. I think the ultimate decision must come from you. I see nothing wrong with a friendly chat and catching up, especially if she has gotten her act together as well. "
64,"I had a mini fridge when I was in college dorms (as do most people), and I don't remember it being particularly loud."
65,"So you're pressuring her to ride her bike to work even though you're not even going to work yourself? Yeah, I see why she's aggravated now."
66,[removed]
67,Literally had the exact same thought as I was writing this out. My coworker said it's like something straight out of a Jane Austen novel.
68,"Normally I would think they would sway her, because she sticks to her morals pretty intently. But in this situation, yes she does know about him pursuing us and the women he's been with, and it doesn't seem to bother her. I know it's because she's romanticizing him and this situation - believing that this is God's will (eye roll). I believe in God, and in signs, but they doesn't come in the form of an Instagram follow like Richard has successfully sold to her."
69,"I'm usually against using financial support as a tool to control someone's behavior, but I think you should seriously consider playing that card. You've moved into her home, so she could keep her home, and you don't have any obligation to continue doing that if she is going to continually harass you.

Of course, I think it's fair start by just calling out her behavior. No more tongue biting, it's time to call a spade a spade. Don't spend any time trying to justify why you and your husband are happy spending a lot of time together, just focus on your mom's behavior. I'd have a sit down conversation with her about it. Tell her what she is doing. Tell her how it makes you feel (again, don't justify your relationship, just tell her how her words make you feel). And then tell her what she needs to do. ""Mom, we need to talk about your recent behavior. You are constantly criticizing hubs and I about how much time we spend together, something that is none of your business. We've both told you that we are happy like this, but you don't seems to understand or believe us. And that is infuriating, frustrating and sad. How would you like it if I went on and on about how dad not having a job is going to lead you two to getting a divorce? Or that you banging dishes, yelling and slamming doors is going to convince dad to leave you? Wouldn't you be upset? Here's is what is going to happen from now on. No more comments, nasty looks, or a single peep about how much time we spend together. Not one more word about divorce. And the childish behavior has to stop. If you think you can't control yourself, leave the house and go for a walk or something, I just don't want to hear it. Go to your room and scream into a pillow if you have to. Hubs and I are doing you and dad a huge favor by living here and paying most of the household expenses. It's something we didn't even think twice about, and we plan on helping you for as long as you need it. That said, I'm going to remind you that we are not obligated to do this, we're doing this because we love you and honestly want to help you. But, that help is contingent upon you treating us like adults and respecting our relationship."""
70,"Break up with him for attempting to emotionally manipulate you into getting rid of an important tribute to a late friend. And yeah, he should feel as if you're not ""his,"" you're not a piece of property.

One of my professors had an abusive ex-husband who forced her to get a small tattoo of a snake removed from her leg. After the divorce, she got an absolutely massive, badass, snake tattoo where it had been. "
71,"He's 25 and can't keep his dick in his pants in public? I think he and your friends are too blasé about it, I would be incredibly upset if this happened to me. Dump the boyfriend and have a talk with your friends"
72,"This is abusive behavior. Has she ever destroyed your things before?
"
73,So phd in math is excuse for leading people on .....seems legit right.
74,I think you are wayyy overthinking this. You are being overly dramatic.
75,"I **strongly** disagree that a shitty five month relationship with a controlling, tantruming bully is worth working on. Op you cannot change him. There was a post recently from a guy who knew he had jealous tendencies and was looking for advice how to not stress his gf out when she's texting a male friend very innocently - that guy has hope. Your bf? No.

You cannot change him and just five months in and he's already bullying you this much? He will be full blown emotionally abusive long before the end of the year. Just respect yourself, leave him and find someone who can manage and communicate about their emotions. ""First gf'"" is NOT AN EXCUSE to be this absurd.

I get that he has good traits. So did my emotionally abusive ex I dated for five years. She isolated me from friends, sucked out all the parts of my personality that made her insecure because she felt I was ""above"" her socially, and 2 years after finally dumping her I still have nightmares and trust issues (that people will get upset about every little thing)."
76,"I would assume that, as the OP mentioned security clearances are involved, she has to escort the intern due to the sensitive nature of the position she is in.

Edit: grammar"
77,"Call your doctor, get back on your meds.

If someone were posting a story like

&gt; I broke my arm a week ago.  I took the pain medicine (let's say it's Ibuprofen since it's not addictive so it doesn't have a bunch of implications tied up with it) as directed at first and cut the dose in half yesterday because I was feeling better.  Now, I'm in pain all the time.  I haven't called my doctor though because I feel like she would just tell me to use more pain medicine and I don't want to take it.  I felt better with it, but I'm thinking that was like a fake me created by these engineered pills and in-pain me is the real me.  I can't deny who I am right?

You'd think they were being ridiculous right?  This is the same thing.

You are sick.  Literally, physically sick.  The you on the meds is the real you.  As I heard from another post, ""if you can't make your own neurotransmitters, store-bought is fine."" "
78,"He's physically abusing you and using the ""cuteness"" as plausible deniability when you end up being bruised. He's not going to stop because he enjoys hurting you."
79,"Thank you for saying this. As an asexual, reading this post made me feel very uncomfortable. People have so many misconceptions about us already, a post like this just gives us a bad name, further enforces the misconceptions, and gives us less credibility. It gives us less credibility because it enforces the concept that one cannot be asexual unless there is something wrong with them like a psychological disorder or hormone imbalance. 

We are born asexual, just like any orientation. We have nothing wrong with us. There is scientific proof of our orientation, just like homosexuality and heterosexuality.

I really hope people don't take away from posts like this that we are like this in any way. For those of us who seek relationships, it's hard enough with the obstacles our orientation already entails, misconceptions like this post about us makes things next to impossible."
80,"Yes, OP is literally Hitler. Great insight."
81,"She already has a lawyer who she's presumably talking to before agreeing to these concessions. She doesn't need you playing the role of backseat driver in the case as well. 

You aren't a lawyer and you don't know the whole situation with her marriage. It may be that the truth is that your girlfriend isn't really entitled to that much and was making unreasonable demands, whereas her ex is taking a principled stand that he has reason to believe the court will agree with. 

My advice would be to mind your own business.  "
82,It sounds like you have some pretty big incompatibilities. Just staying together isn't going to work with these differences. You both deserve relationships that meet your needs and goals.
83,Well it was initially 100k split four ways basically between me him and our parents. Ever since I've complained about the increasing budget he's agreed to pay for whatever it goes up to while I still pay my initial share. Our parents are cool with spitting the final price still.

And it likely hasn't done anything to interfere in your working relationship. Why the focus on your wife chastising a man and not the fact your man was a sexist douche so she called him on it. And on top of that you have imagined that this has doomed your career when no evidence points to this at all, along with still being enraged at your wife days after. Even after she did email and apologise. Honestly, you are really overreacting. "

90,"It sounds like they are doing this on purpose, and it's manipulative, disrespectful and frankly disgusting. This is basically bullying. You can call them out on it, but if they already gang up on you and don't respect you to the point where they prefer you starving over you not being the type of person they want you to be (a meateater) I'm not sure how they will react. You are definitely allowed and should be very angry about this.

This makes me angry so I'm feeling quite spiteful, and I can imagine that personally I would 1. learn to eat spicy food 2. spike my food with chili so they have a terrible experience trying to eat it 3. put food dye in it so it looks horrid. 4. spike their meat so they can't eat it anymore 5. throw out their meat and tell them since they ate all my food I didn't think they'd want it anymore. 

 
However, this immature and also they might just start throwing your food out in the future. Best thing to do would be to try to find a way to move out and limit contact with them, and in the meantime find a way to secure your food by getting a personal locked fridge. "

And I'm not even saying it like it's a really bad thing either because she brought the most part she's a great girl and I really really like her it's just a different perspective of coming where my parents are lucky we had such a great landlord who is willing to let them slip on rent from time to time so we were at homeless"

This is not a sister situation at all. This is a how are you? fine, you? good. Work? busy etc and the brothers fill most of the 40 minutes on skype. We were bound to have a skype at some point, it was the usual ""delay"".

99,"&gt; Am I wrong to feel betrayed by this?

""Betrayed"" is over-dramatic.  ""Disappointed"" perhaps.

102,"You are in another abusive relationship.  You should break up with him, go to your dream college, and stop dating people in the same social group because they might have influenced each other to be pathetic jerks.  

I had an extremely jealous boyfriend too.  He cared about losing me, so it seemed like he cared a lot about me as a person too.  He may have a little bit, but not enough.  He broke up with me after I was sexually assaulted because it made him jealous.  You can find someone who cares about you and wants to see you excel in life (like going to a good college, having freedom to talk to your friends and be happy, etc.).  "
103,"You are not a shitty human being. He is. You are younger and he is in a position of power.

107,"I'm sorry hon but this is the way life works.  You make your choices and live with the consequences, good or bad.

And there's no reason to tell your friends or family or future partners if you don't want to.  Seriously, when did this idea start that everyone you know needs to know everything about you?

109,"The trick to online dating is to not take it seriously until you find someone who is worth taking serious.  Tinder is essentially a digital bar.  You aren't going to take every dude that hits on you seriously, so why take every tinder match seriously.  You match, feel each other out, and if one person moves on...they just weren't feeling it.  And thats ok.  Its a weird way to meet people, but if someone isn't interested, for whatever reason, then it wasn't going to work so why bother stressing over it?  


And you are going to get ghosted.  It literally happens to everyone.  And yeah, it sucks.  But it's called fishing, not catching.  You have to have a hook in the water to catch a fish.

As to your friend who got ghosted after 3 months, that sounds like a classic example of one person only looking for casual and the other looking for serious...and neither having the balls to communicate that to each other.

That's not usually the norm.  Usually if you are going to get ghosted it will be after chit chatting for a couple of weeks and maybe having gone out once or twice.  After 3 months?  I feel like thats an extreme case and she just found herself a turd or he was clearly only looking for casual booty and bailed when he realized she wanted more.

At any rate, you sound awesome and I wouldn't sweat this shit.

Keep looking for people who are interested in the same things as you, or are open to trying the things that you are interested in.  Anyone who thinks you have to act or be a certain way because of the color of your skin or theirs...isn't someone you should waste your time with.


If you do make a move, try finding a mid sized city.  You say you love travel, so visit some of these cities.  Find the areas of town that tend to attract people into the same things as you.

My city has a massive suburban area.  Its full of outdoorsy people.  And then in the middle of the city you have a lot of people in to old cars and motorcycles, hiking, traveling.  Smaller cities tend to be closer to rural areas...and that usually means there are more people who like some of the same things as you.

So look at this as an adventure.  Take weekend trips to different cities.  Find a subreddit for that city and ask for tips and advice on things to do and places to go.

As for the ""you are too pretty to be single crowd"" these aren't people who you should be giving any mind to.  So many people in this world think that finding the best available option is more important than finding the option that fits you best.  

You sound like someone who wants to find a compatible partner instead of finding the best available option you can find.  That's a rare thing in this world...trust me.  It can limit your options, but that is just something you'll have to come to terms with.  

I'm about 10 years older than you and my dating pool is filled with people who want what they want and don't care if they aren't compatible.  

And as I have gotten older, every single person I know with a good relationship or a happy marriage is someone who put compatibility over everything else.  

So Be yourself.  Do what makes you happy.  Everything else will work itself out."
110,"Then provide motivation all you like. 

That level of betrayal would be a deal-breaker for me. One partner says they are private and have private issues and talk to the other partner as a confidante. Then other partner puts it online in venues whether people in other partner's life can see it, and likely knows how to find it. THEN other partner didn't think twice about it until OP found it and his solution was to delete it all and then act super guilty?! He sure wasn't guilty before he was caught. He's made no amends besides pouting to show that he feels badly. 

Maybe it is a gosh darn tremendous relationship other than these 5 glaring instances of betrayal and bad judgement. But that's probably 5 times too many."
111,"""I can understand how marriage doesn't mean that he can no longer be attracted to other guys and I don't know how to feel.""

You sound really compassionate, OP.  
The fact is, your husband is attempting to completely change the foundation of your relationship.  It is not surprising that you feel a bit lost and confused - this is not the agreement you two made when you got married. 

You need to really give yourself time to feel this out, see what you think, understand what you want out of your primary relationship.  Are you ok sharing him and introducing other people into your dynamic, or are you not really looking to have an open marriage?  Would an open marriage bring you any joy, or only meet his needs?  YOU are allowed a preference here too.

""he told me that he wouldn't be comfortable with me sleeping with other men, but other women are okay.""
I don't like that he is trying to pre-emptively decide what would / wouldn't be ok for you if the relationship were to be opened.  This strikes me as very controlling, especially since he has come to you with this very big ask. It's also not at all fair if you aren't into girls.

I'm also not sure he is giving you much of a real choice here.  Is saying ""no, I am not comfortable opening the relationship"" even an option, or is it a deal breaker for him?  You may want to ask him this to assess what is really going on here.  I worry that even if you say no, and he agrees, he may cheat.  Do you think this could happen?

This is an issue less to do with ""opening the relationship"", more with him being controlling and selfish - prioritizing his needs over the relationship you both agreed to, and potentially your needs.  You need to think things through and discuss with him further.  Is he really giving you a say in how he is changing your relationship?  Are you going to be able to get what you want out of the ""new"" open relationship, or will he be the only one to benefit?"
112,Exactly. I know he was blindsided by this but he had to understand that an 11 year old girl needs her daddy and that is him!
113,"Awesome!  Yes, even the women on my colleague's team dressed up like him, making it all the more entertaining. :)"

115,"I used to feel like you about boobs and butts but especially vaginas. Then I got to play with someone else's. Turns out I just had some sex/my own anatomy/bodily autonomy/trying hard to believe being gay was wrong issues that needed working out.

Now? I am dating a man currently and think we're life partners, but if we broke up I just don't see myself attracted to a man again. Turns out I just needed to get comfortable with the fact that I'm predominantly attracted to women in order to, well, be successfully intimate with women. 

That's just me and not you. When I was 18 I was still calling myself bi without making weird ""ugh it doesn't fit"" noises around it. Things change and sexuality is fluid. Just know, you aren't wrong, haven't done anything wrong, and if you don't feel comfortable sharing that part of you with your boyfriend- then don't for now. Your sexuality is yours, especially when you're still figuring stuff out."
116,"encourage your girlfriend to keep text/messages as evidence of her telling him to backoff and stop, as well as a logbook of such interactions inc. in person (time, date, what was said, anything else like was he standing over her) 

This logbook will help your girlfriend track his behaviour, whether it's escalating or lessening, and will be able to serve as evidence for if she needs to file a report with police for harassment. 

As far as dealing with drama from a total cut off goes, there are ways of minimising drama. Whenever it's brought up try and get it to another topic. If you must say something ""He has repeatedly crossed boundaries, despite being asked to stop multiple times. I am limiting contact with him. You can still invite him and me to the same stuff, I can deal with his existence. I'm not going to put up with his disrespect.""   
If people ask what boundaries (just saying boundaries avoids accusations about his faithfulness) ""he's sent me inappropriate pictures, asked me out, etc (but don't say flirting- people always jump on ""you just interpreted it as flirting it wasn't really""go with the strong stuff). I've told him I'm not interested and to stop multiple times.""  should be said to close friends only. Anyone else gets shut down. ""I'm sure you can work it out."" ""I don't want more drama from this than necessary. He's been disrespectful of my boundaries I've stopped talking to him. That's all.""  
If people justify or minimise his behaviour she should say ""I've asked him to stop, and that should be respected.""   
If people say she's accusing him of cheating on his wife or causing drama there ""The only thing I'm saying he did is disrespect my boundaries.""   
Evidence should only be shown to close friends, if anyone, and inappropriate pictures should be shown only to the police. She needs to take the high ground as far as respect goes. He certainly won't.     
If his wife asks about it, she can send things to her. To minimise drama, only if she ask. If your girlfriend wants to do the anti-std thing (which would be nice) she can send the texts to the wife, but this option is likely to cause drama. 

The only thing you should say OP, is that you respect and support her choice. If they ask if you believe her you should say you do. You've seen this behaviour, you've seen your girlfriend tell him to cut it out, you've seen him do it again.   
If they ask why you din't do anything about it ""She can handle it herself, if she wants me to step in she'll say. We do talk about these things."" If they ask for clarity on ""things"" ""how to help each other with problems""

Neither of you should mention keeping evidence for a harassment report. Mention it only to police."
117,"Yeah... So, if you don't have the super hard conversation where you tell her, in very clear terms, ""I don't want to get married, have kids, share finances, or support you while you don't work"", this will be the rest of your life. She'll continue to bring it up every now and then (because these are things she wants out of life, and she's not wrong for wanting them), you will disagree, argue, and then sweep it under the rug to keep the peace. 

It sucks. My ex and I were together for 5 years, it's *so* hard to end a relationship like this. But you need to think of the bigger picture. If you guys don't want the same things, eventually it'll crash and burn. "
118,"Ignore it?  I can guarantee he farts in his sleep too.  If he wakes up enough to say something at the moment, apologize, but otherwise, as long as it's not a shart, I'd just leave it alone.

Your BF is a guy and may need to be schooled on cat-calling, how often women experience it and how not fucking decent or respectful it is.

151,"What are you on about? I never told her she's forbidden from having kids. I told her that **I** will not be a part of bringing such a child into this world, *if* I can help it. Hence ""WE'll be adopting"", as in when we, as a unit, have children together. We're lesbians (and I'm infertile), so it's not like having any manner of kids won't be expensive. I have an adopted disabled brother, so believe me I know all about adoptions not being 100% safe on this either, but there's a lot of mental illness in her family (mostly bipolar but also undiagnosed people who are legit more insane than her, and she will go running down the highway naked if she's off her meds so that's saying something), but I can at least play the numbers in my child's mental/physical health's favor by picking parents with no such problems, so why wouldn't I?? And there is definitely a difference between bringing a child into existence who suffers from a disability vs alleviating the suffering of a child that already exists and has to go through that suffering. One of those types of suffering is caused by you and one is only lessened by you.

I'm honestly surprised by your 10% statistic because her brother, 4 aunts (2 each side), and 2 grandmas all have it. If anything, that just makes me think I want her genetics out of any kids I have even *more* because apparently she's got some super heritable version of bipolar! (It's rapid-cycling &amp; bipolar II if that matters, it's less studied than non-rapid cycling/bipolar I so maybe those rates are different)."

I think your suspicions are valid. She may be doing nothing of the sort. But I've seen a very similar situation play out with a close friend, that led to near total estrangement from his son. 

Play hardball. Get custody sorted out. Do you want to try for 50/50 custody? If so, do it. You might not get it, but you very well might. You're clearly providing a lot of the financial stability that she and her mother benefit from. IF you are ready to be a full time parent in her life, half of the time, you should be. If you aren't looking for shared custody, at least get VERY CLEAR visitation expectations IN WRITING and include WHO is picking up/dropping off your daughter.

If you didn't, of course she's being distant. You're supposed to be her partner and you put her in a horrible position where she had to hear bigoted, openly hostile cruelty. You need to call out your brother, and you need to apologize to her, and you need to make sure it doesn't happen again. "

I mean, yes, but let's be real about the fact that there's a nonzero amount of economic coercion in the picture. If they could make the same money working in retail or food service, would they still choose to work in a strip club? Some of them might, but I don't think it's a stretch to say that a lot of them wouldn't. I don't want to erase their agency, but I think it's also overly simplistic to say that anything less than ""100% trafficking"" (whatever you mean by that, since most trafficking involves some level of cooperation from the victim) means there's no exploitation happening."

I was concerned when you said in your OP that his daughters were cutting up her stuffed toys and using her toothbrush to clean up spillages, but this has confirmed to me that their behaviour goes beyond ""kids being kids"". It seems they are doing things that deliberately target your daughter out of malice, knowing that their father will minimise their actions and that she will have to help clean up the mess they leave in her bedroom. This is not acceptable.

You need to get yourself and (more importantly) your daughter out of this environment. Your boyfriend and his daughters are bullies who are making both your lives miserable - and neither of you deserve it."

Like they are true family members it's really amazing. I think it's one of the reasons that he actually likes me is that I'm so different than her other boyfriends And that I am willing to do things like change lightbulbs in fact if he would've known he probably would've told me to go ahead. She has told me that my parents are the only people he's actually ever had out to their house in the Pacific Palisades that she was dating so that must be saying something about how he feels about me and my me up bringing.   Also the fact that he did make my girlfriend work when she was in high school at a minimum wage job also shows that he does appreciate that work is necessary. So I think if I'm correct what I'm taking from this is Maybe I just need to chill out a little bit too and I understand that I'm bringing my own baggage to the relationship as close to it being all silliness that I see from spending $400 on an electrician to change a lightbulb.

She is already committing abuse even if she  hasn't touched them. Taking and distributing photos of naked children in her care isn't funny or a joke, it is abuse. You need to report her to the police. Take the photo and her details to them and explain the situation. You have no idea what else she is capable of and who else she might be a sending pictures to. You also need to do this in case it ever comes to light by someone else reporting it, you'll have no proof that you didn't ask for that picture if it's on your phone. I feel physically sick at this.

182,"going to jump in front of rosegoldlife on this one

It could be a connective tissue disorder, but more commonly a shoulder dislocation can create a groove in the cartilage of the ball/socket joint. This along with stretching out the capsule and ligaments (not to mention possible rotator cuff damage) increase the chance to dislocate subsequently in the future which sounds like it is what you are encountering.

The best decision here is to see an orthopedic specialist AND physical therapist to work on the surrounding musculature and determine if any surgical intervention is needed as chronic dislocation is a risk factor for earlier onset osteoarthritis.

This is actually a fairly common problem that can be addressed in multiple ways since it sounds like you are still undergoing the effects of it. "

You are putting waaaay to much importance on titles and full blood/half- end of the day he is your brother and part of your family. Being full blooded doesn't make anyone more or less your family.

I've cut my own mom out of my life. She is my biological mother but to me she is nothing more than the egg donor that birthed me.

188,"You make your ex tell his son he won't be keeping his word. Your son will eventually realize what you did - dad isn't reliable. It's going to suck, but there isn't much you can do to help, besides being there for your son. 

In terms of your ex - remind him that promises need to be kept and if he can't (or won't) keep them, he needs to put on his big-boy pants and face those consequences. And in the future, think before he makes promises he can't keep. 

Let your ex see your son when he gets back - it sucks that he won't be there when your son really needs him, but keeping him away will hurt your son more than punish your ex.  "

She doesn't get to decide if that's something you tell or don't tell your partner. She needs to come clean and the fact she didn't do it before they moved in, yeah, I think that's pathetic.

I feel like this could easily become a situation where he starts knocking on your door all the time (we see that on here regularly).

As for what to say, try something like, ""Thanks! We're not looking for new players."" or ""We aren't able to expand the guest list, but again please text if we ever get too loud.""

Maybe after you live there for a little while, you will get a feel for whether you can have the occasional neighborly chat without him trying to intrude all the time. Until then, you can strike a polite but distant tone.

I switched providers because my first rheumatologist said he didn't prescribe them at all (and also because he refused to do xrays / MRI - which meant the pain reached a level where I literally couldn't walk, and then my orthopedic doctor finally diagnosed my rheumatology issue, at which point he started to take things seriously).  I see other people with AS who receive lots of pain meds and get treatment for fatigue, but I don't know how they do it.  I've talked to multiple doctors and can't seem to find anyone willing to treat the fatigue at all.  And get 30 tramadol a month for the pain - which I know isn't enough.   But I honestly don't know what more I can tell my doctors in order to get things more under control.  I'm doing all the physical therapy they recommend.  I'm doing the non-PT physical activities they recommend (yoga / pilates).  And I'm taking the anti-inflammatories and pain meds they will give me.  And I'm self medicating with edibles when all that isn't enough.  And you are right - I'm still in a lot of pain.  It is a crummy world right now for chronic pain patients.  "

When he goes out with these friend you are afraid because you love him. He doesn't seem to care about his health and safety but you do. When he hurts himself it hurts and scares you.

You feeling inferior about your dog is not her fault. Like I said, if it was that important you could retrain your dog. It takes longer than training a dog from nothing because you have to change their bad habits but you should be able to do it by the end of summer if you practice it consistently. 

You can ask her to tone down the comments or walk the dogs separately because it hurts your feelings but if I were her I would think that you are the petty one in this scenario. "

You are over reacting COMPLETELY. Her making you feel stupid about the mail wasn't very nice of her, i'll give you that. But for the most part - it was a funny, harmless prank. You seem to be taking it way harder than you should be. You are using words like 'sadistic' to explain her behaviour like.. there really is nothing sadistic here.

Your fiancee is blowing off your concern but here are the issues I see:

1. He doesn't care about your wishes. You've explained multiple times why this bothers you &amp; he frankly doesn't care. Great husbands listen to their partner's concerns.

2. He's inconsiderate. He doesn't even bother to check in with you. This isn't how loving, respectful partners behave towards each other.

3. Alcohol is a carcinogen. Check the CDC's list of known carcinogens if you don't believe me. He isn't doing his body any favors and you're both going to have to deal with all the health implications as he ages. He says he uses it to decompress but alcohol isn't a healthy way to deal with stress.

4. He must be wasting a crap ton of money every month drinking out.

5. Why doesn't he ever invite you to join? Sounds a bit shady.

This issue is certainly something to consider if you want to spend the rest of your life dealing with. "

224,"There are always going to be people who want to put your baby girl down just for the fact that she is a girl. Good for you for being so fiercely protective from the get go.

Your husband, however, needs to get the fuck on board. He needs to protect his baby girl from those who would speak down to her just because of her gender, and yes, it should start now, with his ""friends."" They need to know what they are saying is not okay, and will not be tolerated. He doesn't even have to get mean. A deadpan face and voice while saying ""Why should you apologize because it's a girl? I'm thrilled to have a daughter, that's not funny."" should be enough to make them feel awkward and stop. 

And by all means, please feel free to tell the next person that tries this to fuck right off, whether or not your husband steps in.

With my current SO,I am infinitely more confident and know what I want. I knew I wanted to take it slow because intimacy was special to me and I only wanted to move forward when I was 100% comfortable. He understood and felt similarly so it worked out.

Hurting someone you care about isn't ""slipping up"", it's not like forgetting to take out the trash or leaving a couple of dirty dishes in the sink. Not hitting your partner shouldn't be a habit you have to unlearn, especially in a new relationship.

245,"I would say so, it's definitely very rare here for people to be married so young. 

Building it means learning to be comfortable with eachother. How to figure out how to be around someone for not just dates and fun activities, but when they're sick or tired or stressed or whatever. I know you've been together for a bit but living together is a truly different test, because you can't shy away from a text or say you don't want the other person coming over for XX reason. 

Also, at 22, you still need to be selfish and focus on setting up the rest of your life. So now's the time to figure out how to manage the fact you'll need to devote a significant amount of time to that endeavor and also figure out how to handle what living together brings. "

This is manipulative behavior, he thinks by going overboard reactionarily, you will back off.

I wouldn't stay with a person like this. Get outta there. Based on everything else he is at the very least emotionally cheating, but it's obvious he is being emotionally manipulative and unwilling to talk out problems in a relationship. Not worth the effort."

248,"This is all incredibly one-sided. You think the marriage was good because you weren't abusive &amp; because your friends were jealous. (Was your wife happy at this point in your marriage, or did you assume she was happy because you felt things were going well?)

After you stopped exploring, you write about how your wife did &amp; didn't feel at that point. (Is this based on what she has actually told you, or is this how you think she felt?)

You write that ""we"" thought she was depressed. (Did you assume that because based on your criteria of not abusive &amp; friends are jealous, your relationship was going great, so there must be something wrong with her?)

Lastly, you write that she didn't give you any warning &amp; didn't give you a chance to fix things. (Everything leading up to this was a warning - all of the problems you were having previously. It jus wasn't an ultimatum yet.)

Point being, if you want to work on the relationship, I think the first thing to do is to admit to your wife that you ignored a lot of signs along the way that the relationship was not going well. You felt things were fine on your end, &amp; you weren't checking in on her feelings. This isn't a bombshell - your relationship wasn't perfect if until the day she told you it wasn't. You just weren't dealing with what was actually happening because it wasn't at an ultimatum state yet. "

He doesn't get to decide when to move on, and saying sorry means less than nothing if he never does anything to change it. If a person killed someone, would you think it'd be reasonable for them to say to the family, ""Can we just move on from this? I know you're upset that I killed your family member, but *I'm* over it, I said I was sorry, so why can't you just move on?"" Same reasoning here. He's the one that wronged you; he doesn't get to decide whether things are okay or not. ""Saying sorry"" without doing anything to actually make up for the issue or try and change things is just empty words."

He's either stupid, unfair or just likes having a reason to put you down.  Perhaps all 3.

Our dog is an uncommon breed and sits for her picture with strangers a couple of times a year. She's a little celeb at Cheshire oaks.

269,"The ""kid"" is 22, why is she tolerating having her parents on her bank account?  Outside of the parents shoving money in there to pay for school, the adult child should have an autonomous account.  And adults should speak to each other respectfully regardless of relationship.

Sounds bloody awful."
270,"Find a specialist. If you're near or in a major city, there should be programs specifically for domestic abusers that you can look into. Do some research and get on the phones. 

And most importantly, *give her space* while you're doing this. Every instinct you have is going to tell you to cling even tighter to her, because you have to keep her close to ""prove"" you're changing. Fight that instinct. That is the opposite of what will show her you really intend to change. Let *her* decide how much contact to have with you right now - that's step 1 in learning to respect her as an autonomous equal. You've done some serious damage and she needs time to clear her head if she's going to recover from it. 

Keep up the effort. Do not stop trying to improve, no matter what happens to your relationship. If you're only seeking help because you're panicking that she's going to leave, nothing is actually going to stick and you'll slide right back into your old habits. "

Go get a coffee together or something, explain that sibling shared this information, that you know that situation X is occurring, and that you're sorry for getting in his business but the same thing happened to you and you wanted to know if you could help. don't get defensive if he gets upset with you - if this kind of thing had happened to me at that age it would have been a *big* shock to have an acquaintance approach me like that. or - maybe it would be better to give him a note? that would give him the privacy to react to the info in his own way. I'm honestly not sure. "
275,Glad to hear it. Anyone who outright tells you that they want you to be totally dependent on them is someone you should walk away from.
276,"Here's the thing: the only person who can keep her from harming herself, is her.

She is using the threat of that possibility to control you and keep you from breaking up with her. That's abuse. The only way to handle threats of self-harm is to literally turn it over to the professionals and walk away. You aren't going to be able to paper over the cracks; the cracks will always be bigger and deeper than you can cover.

You will find yourself instead sacrificing more and more of yourself in an effort to cover her damage, but no matter what you do, it will never be enough. Her hunger for 'proof' that you 'really love her' will always be greater than your ability to provide - not because you are in any way lacking, but *because she is mentally unwell and it is coming out as abuse*.

When she threatens self-harm, call emergency services. If she is serious about it, they will get her the help she needs. If she is NOT serious about it and is using it as a means of control, that is abuse, and she needs to recognize how fucking wrong it is to do that, so calling emergency services is STILL the way to go. Don't mess around with that kind of threat - it's automatically above your paygrade.

And in any case, get out. Put on your own life vest. She is abusive (loveisrespect.org has great resources for recognizing and escaping abuse) and you need to get clear of it."
277,Honestly she's prob awkward because you are acting awkward and have for a long time. Maybe she think you don't like her or something? Honestly I would text or send her a fb message basically acknowledging it and saying it's haunted / made you feel awk for years and wanted to clear the air. I wouldn't think it would be weird if someone brought this situation up to me in that context

I'm sorry but in my eyes this is NO different. Some people would accept you with open arms, some people would feel lied and betrayed too. This is not something she gets to withhold from her partner."

285,"""Fair vs. Equal"" refers to a sociological/philosophical debate on the best way opportunities should be available to a diverse population. 

If you want to get pedantic with the words involved you would be better off bringing your disagreement with the person who originated the theory, rather than someone quoting from it. 

You are basically yelling at a cashier for the prices of food at a grocery store.

286,"No. You have standards. Not everyone has to share them, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with not wanting drugs in your life."
287,"i read the whole post. and my opinion stands.

is it messed up that she got physical? yes. both of you clearly were not at your best in this relationship, and i think it's good that it's over.

but just because you both agreed on expectations (and frankly, i am skeptical) doesn't mean that agreement is set in stone. the level of dysfunction in your relationship shows that clearly you were not on the same page. and i'm a firm believer that expecting such a minute level of detail is not sustainable or healthy, particularly when it's picked apart and viewed with suspicion. in my opinion, this kind of expectation is indeed controlling. 

but bottom line: WALK AWAY. you ended the relationship. it was toxic. it got physical. you fought and your trust was damaged. and i repeat, *you ended the relationship.* you don't get to break up with her and *also* demand an apology or explanation. and reality check: even if you got one, you would probably be unsatisfied with it. so walk away. and then think a little about *why* you expect that much ""transparency"" in a relationship and why you react the way you do. "
288,"In fact it's really important to fight in the beginning, because otherwise lines get drawn and bad habits form and it's very difficult to change. By fight I mean make the conversation about your needs happen, and fearlessly defend your needs while keeping your ears open. Not fighting indicates fear and doormat behavior, and guys don't even like that behavior much-- just some of the worse ones will take advantage of it. No evidence the bf is a bad guy at all. I mean who can be offended by ""Hey, you know how you said you wanted to get married before 30? What happened to that?"""
289,"he said he doesnt want to and that we are compatible - he disagrees with me about us being incompatible.

290,This is exactly my thought! I even had an extra toothbrush in my purse because I went to the dentist on Wednesday 
291,"Wow. So she told you she did not want a relationship. You completely disregarded her feelings and pressed for one. Now you have the guts to make her feel guilty for disrespecting a relationship you manipulated her into. Cool. 

So to be clear, her feelings don't matter and only yours do. 

Break up with her. You clearly don't respect her. If you did, you'd be telling her to not feel bad because at the time she was clearly conflicted about being in a relationship with you, made that clear to you, and there is nothing to be sorry for. "
292,"This is pretty relevant information, OP. You'd get better advice if you edits your post to include his cultural background.

295,"She's off limits. 

You don't even love her. You even stated that's infatuation. You have a strong crush. Like, her interests aren't unique to her. A LOT OF WOMEN enjoy video games, comic books, and are laid-back. Like. You literally described nothing particularly unique or special or that anybody that hasn't had at least one conversation with the girl wouldn't know. 

She's your girlfriend's roommate. Do you want to fuck up their living situation? THIS IS HOW YOU FUCK UP THEIR LIVING SITUATION. Not to mention their friendship. Don't be that guy. 

You are seeing someone else. Don't be a scumbag and two-time. Nobody likes a cheater.

You're clearly young and are obviously in the 'get my dick wet' phase so how about you just be single and date around or have multiple non-exclusive relationships where you are clear and honest with all of your partners that they are one of few/many. That's how adults have relationships. 

Like come on.

Unless its true love (which I doubt), walk away. 

Trifling. "
296,"You need to get out. This behavior is only escalating and this is a dangerous situation for you and your dog.

304,"Seems like now you have a dynamic where he just hears ""take a shower"" as unnecessarily critical. You've got to reframe this somehow, to make a shower not something he has to ""give in"" to and do because you have decided it's ""right."" A shower needs to be his idea. 


So apologize for nagging about the shower. Say you only meant well, but you are sorry that it put such a damper on things. Say you appreciate him trying to be cleaner and using a washcloth. Say you will stop bugging him about a shower, with a few requests- that he not use your pillow, and that if he wants to have sex, he will shower first because you cannot be in the mood when he is dirty and smelly. If he can agree to this, you can probably deal with the rest. Oh, and buy a couch cover that he washes once a week, lol. 


And then, you either deal with this, or you don't. Not going lie it's a strange battle to be having. But it's clear you are not going to win, and even if you do, he'll probably just be bitter that he has to do something he doesn't want to do. So try to make the shower less of an issue and more just focus on a compromise?"
305,"We signed on for another year not too long before this stuff started so we're already locked in, unfortunately. Plus we love the house and it's perfectly in our budget so we don't want to leave :/"
306,"Well, its possibly he had a similar position at a different company previously. I don't think he would be getting the extra responsibilities if he wasn't actually good at it"
307,"I don't know why no one has explained what this word means, even if it does seem obvious, since you did ask and it's clearly all new to you. ""Our third"" is basically a three-way-relationship equivalent term for ""my partner."" 

There are a couple of extra things implied in ""our third."" The most important one for your purpose is that it implies the friend is your mother and father's partner (not just your father's). The extent to which each party is directly sexual with one another isn't something you need to know, but at a minimum they understand themselves as all being in a relationship together (not, say, your dad having a side chick that your mother tolerates).

This probably doesn't matter so much for your purposes, but ""our third"" would often also imply that the ""couple"" is the primary relationship and the ""third"" is the secondary relationship. That delineation may not matter in any practical sense if the relationship is going well, but if some sort of jealousy or conflict or even just a scheduling problem arose, it's expected that the primary relationship comes first.

I'm not actively poly myself, although I have interacted with that world, so I'm sure some poly folks can correct or clarify if there's anything I haven't expressed well."
308,"&gt; I'd probably be happier being alone, to be truthful. 

This relationship is only benefitting your BF and his kids. They get a clean house to play in, things to wreck, and your BF gets someone to clean up after him. I don't see any way how this makes your or your daughter's life better. "
309,"In one specific comment thread your responses were pretty dismissive of the severity of the situation. You made it sound like you don't think it's a big deal to emotionally cheat on your wife and that it's okay because she had a ""crush on someone at the grocery store"" which isn't the same as someone you work with constantly and can build a relationship with. That's more akin to finding a hollywood actor or musician attractive. "
310,"Can't you just see your father next weekend and not ruin this trip for your girlfriend? Yeah, I'd be pissed if you cancelled on seriously long-held plans with me too. It's not like being father's day was some crazy unpredictable thing. I'm sure the death of the family friend is rough but surely your father will appreciate your presence just as much on a different weekend.

Is this the first time you've put your family before your girl? Something tells me this isn't the first time you've been blasé about cancelling plans with her for an arbitrary last-minute reason."
311,did you even read the thread?  op is getting abused by SOs family and so does nothing...
312,"Are you suggesting people fake friendship with him?

Or do you not realize that feelings of friendship can die when someone does something shitty?"
313,"It is interesting to hear other folks in this thread try to explain away attraction to other women as something society programs into you or something. I can tell you that as a gay person this sort of reasoning is sooo dangerous because it sends the message that your attractions aren't valid if they fall outside heterosexuality. Here's the thing if you're attracted to women you're attracted to women there's nothing wrong with that. Just like being attracted to men, there is nothing wrong with that either.  You can be straight, gay, bisexual, etc and finding out how you feel is a journey. 

If you love your boyfriend and see a future with him then stick with it. If exploring your sexuality is a priority then pursue that. Unfortunately no one here can tell you what's right for you. "
314,Nothing I hate more than music snobbery. 
315,"Sounds to me like maybe she lost custody of her kids because of the drugs/legal problems.  Her husband was/is probably able to keep his parental rights as long as she's not living there.  If that's the case she will be able to return once she completes a rehab program and shows she has recovered.  In my experience though, only about 1 in 50 actually turn their life around enough to keep their kids long term.  Don't mean to be a downer.  Kudos to OP for showing kindness to someone in a hard situation.  OP:  just because you trust your husband around another woman doesn't mean you need to give him a long leash.  Be supportive of him and nearby.  Don't withdraw and watch from afar testing him to do the right thing."
316,"Do you see yourself with her five years from now, even if nothing in the relationship changed/improved? Do you feel like you need *her* and not just *anyone* for companionship, since you are a self-described introvert?"
317,"In my opinion there's really nothing you could/should have done differently. Your BF loves you. His parents (maybe just Dad, idk) are the ones putting the distance and being racist assholes. In an ideal world everyone has perfect relationships with their parents and in-laws... but sometimes parents and in-laws are bigoted, prejudiced people and its better not to have those people in your life. Talk to your BF later and see how it made him feel and how to move forward. Its a shitty situation no doubt, and it sucks to be rejected based on something you can't control (My GF's parents don't like me either just because we're 2 women in a relationship). But it is what it is and at least you have a strong partner willing to see through his parents' bullshit and make you the priority."

322,"Uh, from the perspective of a woman trying to conceive, that will surely fuel the fire. Sister ""steals"" babies name, husband then tells her that ""baby making"" is off until she gets her attitude straight is like punishing a kid. Definitely won't end in a constructive evaluation of her behavior. He needs to sit her down and communicate with her. Baby fever makes people feel all sorts of irrational feelings. If they have a conversation and get to the root of the issue, it would be better effective. ""She gets everything"", I'm going to go out on a limb and assume she may be feeling some jealousy as far as her sister in law already having a baby, AND using the name she wanted so badly. "

333,"This is why those stupid jokes matter. Your girlfriend made a racist feel like she agreed with him and it was a safe space to spew racist bullshit. 

When you make racist jokes, you make racists feel good and people of color feel unsafe.

When you make rape jokes, you make rapists feel supported and rape survivors feel unsafe. 

They aren't just jokes. When you two make them between yourself, you know the context and it's okay. You have to know someone REALLY well to know this is the case. You didnt know Bill that well. 

And even if you two are outspoken about racial equality, guess what?  That just reinforces Bill's worldview that everyone thinks like him and you two just talk about racial equality for PC brownie points and don't really believe it. 

Those jokes matter. Be more careful.

You will not have to do anything extra for them to learn it. Your wife and her family will be in charge of that. That's priceless.

Honestly, I can't imagine being so late on my BC - in fact, when I was on the shot, I'd book my next appointment whenever I got my update (though I appreciate not everywhere offers bookings so far in advance). Her being so careless about it makes me wonder if there's not something more going on here...

Not to disparage your girlfriend, but how strong is this maternal instinct of hers? Enough to 'accidentally' slip on her BC to get around the fact you don't want to deliberately have a baby together yet?"
356,"I would be getting in touch with a divorce attorney asap.
&gt; Question: Is there something wrong with me, or is this the process a spouse adultery.

Its natural to feel betrayed and have some trust issues after being cheated on by your partner like that. Keep in mind though that just because your wife lied, doesnt mean everyone is a liar."
357,Get out before you realize it's a strait-jacket and you're trapped.
358,"That first paragraph- spot on. OP, stop worrying so much about your spouse and speak up for your child. You know how people of color talk about allyship- well, you need to start living it. "
359,"I'm over 10 years older than you and have been through my share of adult relationships.

You won't change him. You will never get him to ""understand."" He ""understands"" just fine but he lashes out on you because that is what make him feel good. You have noticed that it's always all about his feelings and emotional manipulation, and yours never seem to matter. That's true. But it seems like you still think somehow you can figure out the right words to change that. You can't. 

You'll see. You can't change him. The only thing you can really do is decide how many of your prime years you want to waste being treated this way. No matter how long it takes, whether it takes you until you're 25, 30, or 40, you will eventually realize in the end that you could not change him. "
360,"I am not, although that is primarily because it is an out of state wedding that's happening on a weekday and I simply can't afford to take off work or spend any extra money right now. 

Also I don't want to go alone and I can't find a date. I tried to get that mutual friend to attend with me (this was WAY before the Tinder stuff), but she refused.

Mostly it's the money that's stopping me."
361,"&gt;I've been interested in the same girl (""Barb"" - 23F, single) since forever (8 years, to be exact)

Step one. Stop putting Barb (or ANY woman for that matter) on a pedestal. Pining after a girl for 8 years is excessive. Lingering crushes are one thing but you've got to get her out of your head.

Go out and meet new people. Lots of people. Without the goal of dating.

The main difference between a ""NiceGuy"" and a normal guy is an overall obsession with being in a relationship and a heaping helping of entitlement. "
362,The parents probably don't see it because they've spent their daughter's lifetime making excuses for her terrible behaviour. It happened in my family until it got to the point similar to OP's (though not at a wedding) for them to finally back down a little and not lose two of their children from their lives for the sake of one. 
363,Keep the son away while he's still there. In fact do you have a male relative you can move in as security?
364,"&gt;He has stopped talking and looking at my son even.
The stuff he is doing to my son is recently. Basically he has decided I am not raising him manly enough and has tried to step in and teach him how to be a man. Whatever that means. 

Get him out of the house before he really fucks your son up. Seriously, this is already abuse. My bil's dad tried to man him up, and broke every bone in his hand on purpose. "
365,Lol wouldn't be a happy Reddit ending without one of these.
366,"You've done nothing wrong, so you absolutely should ""do you"" both literally and figuratively.

It would be cheating if you were chatting up some girl and getting her to send nudes for you to jerk off to. Watching porn or looking at random images on the internet is not cheating. It is incredibly controlling to tell someone they cannot masturbate, that is not healthy and is not normal in a relationship.

That alone would be a big enough red flag to have me running for the hills. Couple that with the fact you have incompatible sex drives and you're asking to run into problems in the future with this girl. I'd strongly consider whether or not she's someone you need in your life."

Much bigger issue - get back on your meds. You were doing better when you were on your meds....*because* you were on your meds. Your mental health needs to be your top priority.

375,"They both have location trackers on their phones. Her boyfriend of two years, who she had plans with the same night, suddenly disappeared on her without an explanation. That's not crazy.

376,"I think you missed the part where OP said that her father often drives drunk and that both of her parents are verbally and physically abusive towards her.

How can he respect her parents if they horribly abuse the woman he loves? How can you expect anyway feel respect in this situation? Would you respect a horrible person who beats up somoen you love?"
377,"&gt; to say it's mostly lower class and urban is racist and completely untrue.

PREACH.

I live in a white middle-class suburb. I had a middle-aged white guy follow me into the grocery store and wait for me by the self-checkout just to tell me to smile. I flashed my two-week-old abdominal surgery scar at him and he fucking RAN.

Asshole behavior has no racial or financial boundary.

378,"If he wasn't okay with it, he wouldn't continue to go with them and keep the secrets from their wives. "

381,"Why would you propose to a woman who doesn't like children?

382,"Sometimes you need both kindness and sternness. The child did nothing wrong and indirectly she's being punished for her mother's mistakes by the only man she's known as a father, a man she will likely consider her father for the rest of her life. She is also the sister of his two biological sons and that will never change either, they are family. I understand the hurt he feels, but at the same time, his choices are going to compound the pain for him and for her and for his sons as well. It's not shitting on him to be clear on those facts. 

He needs counseling as soon as possible. He needs to not make any rash decisions until he's not in the swamp of hormones and emotions that he is in right now. Honestly, that's the worst part about all of this is that when people fly away like this and disappear it just makes it harder to come back, that flight response sometimes says ""keep flying, keep avoiding the pain"". Like I said, I get the hurt he feels, but two wrongs don't make a right. 
"
383,"No it's not. 

My personal definition of ""fight"" isn't the same as yours. 

That's ok. Neither of us is wrong. 

By your definition of ""fight"" my husband and I **do not** fight. 

By my definition of ""fight"" you and your partner **do** fight.

395,"You know things were rushed. You proceeded anyways.

This is why you don't rush things. Please learn your lesson.

As a mother with a child *you owe it to your child to never introduce her to someone who she will engender affection for as a step-parent figure who isn't going to stick around in her life*. When you have a child that child shouldn't be meeting the new guy in your life for at least half a year to a year. *They definitely should not be in a living situation with them before a year.*

OP, please do what is best by your child. Next time you meet someone please take it slow. Let them know up front you have a kid and if thats a dealbreaker they need to GTFO. Also slowly but surely introduce your kid to this person. Not just drop them in their lap one day. 

If rushing things with someone when you have a kid was supposed to work then this would have."
396,"This is not ok.

This girl is a predator. I don't care how nice she is and how long you have been friends. 

She raped you.

Go down to the police station and report this. Don't let her think this is ok. She will do it again. 

Think of it this way. If your female friend told
you this same story, reversed with a male penetrating her while she was unconscious, what would you tell her to do?

Also your parents sound like complete idiots."
397,Right dude. She's known this guy before you started dating and she still chose to date you not him. Nothing to worry about. 
398,"This. Grow yourself in ways that make YOU happy, not for others."
399,"&gt; Also, all my friends just hook up with girls by dancing with them and them starting to kiss them, there's little to no talking happening at all, so I don't see how the girls would possibly think they're looking for a relationship

Gonna be blunt, your friends are probably more attractive than you. Sorry, but that's the game when you ""want to sleep with a lot of women"". Women who ARE looking for a hookup have limitless options, they're going to always pick the cream of the crop."
400,He physically assaulted you and then manipulated YOU into apologizing to HIM. The best way for you to convince him not to touch you anymore is to never see him again. You can do better.
401,I too want to know lol what was he eating? How was he eating it? AHHHH the suspense is killing me!
402,He was pretty clean at first but started slacking off maybe two months in. He was easier to confront about stuff before she moved in. 
403,"So, you are just shallow? 

She's proud of her body. If you can't handle that, date someone else and she can find someone who is also proud of her. "
404,This. Morning glories are also the same and would probably choke out the other plants growing around there. I have sweet pea vines germinating in the flower box that I'm going to use for a trellis but I may just transplant some around that area too. 
405,"He was in one long term relationship in highschool, so nearly ten years ago. 

He is with you. 

If you really can't get over this, you need to seek professional help, because there's literally nothing here to cause you this kind of worry. "
406,This is the best answer IMO. You give a good script to convey what the op is about without backing down. OP did nothing wrong since saying you dated someone implies a sexual history. Even being a beard can imply some sexual experimentation depending on the couple.

Yeah that's a set up for an abusive relationship if I ever heard one. Which this is, and it's escalating. 

He doesn't apologize because he doesn't believe he is wrong. Whereas you know what he's doing is wrong. You aren't going to fix this. You need to get out to protect yourself. You hit the breaking up point before this even started. 2 years? Can you imagine living the rest of your life like this? NO. GTFO"

421,"Well, maybe if she weren't abusive, she'd have a stable relationship and children now.

You're making way too much of a big deal out of this and letting your anxiety make you feel waaaaay too guilty.    Yes, it would be sad if someone who wanted kids didn't get to have any, but *she's physically abusive!*.  Can you imagine what she'd do to a child the second the kid disagreed with her?

You really sounds like you're dangerously close to doing something MONUMENTALLY stupid, which is getting her pregnant out of guilt, thus condemning you AND a child to life with this horrible woman.

&gt;doesn't absolve me of the impact to her. 

What fucking impact?  You talk like she's *owed* something from you.

You do NOT have a responsibility to ""Do Right"" by her.  That's ridiculous, stupid nonsense.  Engage your *brain* for half a second here and realize what a *fucking idiotic* idea giving this woman a BABY would be.

Every time you feel guilty I want you to picture her kicking her own child in the groin, or slapping them across the face, or picking themselves up off the ground where she's knocked them.  Maybe that image will convince you that this is a terrible idea."

Severe nut allergies are no joke. If his allergy is really serious, all it takes is a speck of a nut to trigger it. He can breath in peanut dust and that can trigger a reaction. 

&gt;It's like he wants the entire world to revolve around him, even though it's HIS problem.

He's not asking the entire world to change. He's asking you, as someone he's in close proximity with, to not handle things that are toxic to him so he can continue to breath. "

The job I have is enjoyable and I will always try to have a job that I love, but it's only to make my life with him happier.  I am not engaged to my employer and wouldn't freaking sacrifice everything for them--no freaking way. A job is a job, but my life is more than just a job. "

""Oh, I don't think you'll need that big a size, how about I bring you a 12?"" No... how about you bring me the size I asked for, because I am a grown ass woman who can probably be trusted to know which clothes will fit my own body, k?

She admits that she is being irrational by putting the blame on you.  She knows it's not right, but she's having a hard time accepting that she is 100% responsible for her own actions and the shit that happened from them.  

Personally, I would just completely leave her alone until she has time to come to terms with this and work through accepting her own life choices.  Maybe you two can be friends again someday, but that day isn't today."

I used to be a total flake -- we would make plans, they'd show up at my doorstep, and I'd still be sleeping. After I graduated high school and left home, I became much better. But the point is they stuck by me through that so maybe I should afford her some leeway too. 

Alright well I asked Emma why she didn't ask Ann to chip in for the tow fee as well. Her answer was that she has been driving me around a lot more since Ann hasn't been hanging out with us as often. Emma's only example is she has a sorority sister who threw 3 parties over the course of 6 months and Emma invited me along as emotional support since she's shy. Emma's friend Iives 45 min away from us, and each time Emma drove us there and I didn't offer to drive. I admitted that I did just allow her to drive each time and didn't offer. I guess I was operating under the impression that if you do the inviting, especially to an event that's 50 mins away, you do the driving. Also, I viewed them as ""Emma's friends"" and not my friends. I wouldn't even go to these parties if not for Emma. I said sorry, I was just assuming she would drive without offering any reparation. I said I completely understand if she doesn't want to drive us anywhere for the time being, and I offered to pick her up and drive if we want to hang out. 

Ironically, it seems like this whole time Emma thinks I have been the penny pincher whereas I think she's being the penny pincher (in this specific case, she's usually good with paying her share. Ann is a different case). 

Emma said okay, but that it's going to take a while to get over the hurt she felt from this ordeal. "
445,oh!  oh!  And give her a great big smile and a wave after you point at your headphones showing that you can't hear a thing!  Guaranteed to drive her even more nuts.!
446,"Oh, honey. Can you stay with another family member or something? I think you need to get out of there if you can.

This is not your fault. I'm sorry your dad is a creep."
447,"For someone like her (as you describe her) planning a way to celebrate you is not a burden, it is a way she expresses love.  You are refusing to allow her to express love at a HUGE milestone in your family life.  She wants to show you how glad she is that You are the father of her child... and you want to ignore it.  To her, that would feel like you don't value being the father of her child and would rather pretend you aren't on that day."
448,"His father has gotten the chance to celebrate 33 fathers days and OP has been there for 30 of them. Wife should've made it clearer but OP has his own family now and will need to start doing things like starting his own Christmas traditions with his kid, being there for Father's Day because he's a father now (do Father's Day lunch with grandpa and dinner with the wife and child or something) and other celebrations they might observe. "
449,"If all he wanted was a day off to go to the titty bar and stare at boobs, I assume he could do that in your current location.

There is a reason he went really far away, and its because he didn't want to be seen with whomever he was with.

Have a conversation when not having sex or about to, about your sexual needs. If you are okay with not getting oral sex, propose alternatives that'll work for you. If he's not willing to do anything that's not penetration or just for your pleasure, you have a selfish lover and partner. "

I don't know how he'd feel about that or even whether it's possible to find a decent therapist at short notice in OP's area, but this is definitely the kind of thing that can really mess with your worldview."
455,Seconding this. In early high school I babysat some kids weekly while their mom was upstairs working. 14 year olds are responsible enough to watch kids (especially if you're home at the time) and don't need to be paid much.
456,"&gt;How is it this never came up?

There are still individual times that are good. Whatever wall I had up that prevented me from seeing the pattern finally fell down and I've been able to take it in as a whole. For some years we did have sex more how I preffered, because we were busy and had work and school so he didn't have the energy for the theatrics as often as he does now. 

The past year or so he's been being very persistent about not wanting lazy sex as he calls it. I know its sad that it took me this long to realize what he wanted wasn't what I wanted, but I guess he has become more persistent and that pressure is what it took for me to realize I wasn't into it, not because I was tired but because I just wasn't into it period.

&gt;With a guy you haven't had a good sex life with for 6 out of 7 years. Why did you marry him? Why is he not just a friend?

We got married right out of college, and we assumed that we still wanted the same thing in bed and that we'd have more time after school was done to do those things. I figured my kinkyness was just dampened by school stress and that it would come back. The self realization that I didn't want it period took me a lot longer because of denial.

We are incredible compatible on every other level. We find each other very attractive, have the same hobbies, beliefs, humor, and in general communicate quite well. So those are the reasons I married him.

&gt;My guess is you have no problem finding other partners.

Its true that it is easier for me, but overall neither of us have had that many.

&gt;How much do you work? If it is close to how much he does then he is wrong. If he works a lot more than you then you should be doing more.

We both work full time."

461,"Talk to them, but not at a time when they're annoyed. Ask them what you can do to help out more, and make sure they know how much you're working. They may not realize how many hours you're at work. If you approach it from a place of ""I want to help more!"", I don't see why they'd get upset. "
462,"I second this. These people helped you and your family out in times of need, and it would be very hurtful to turn it around to sell it to the man's ex-wife, knowing that she has bad intentions.

I hope you are using condoms
"
464,"You're not wrong for feelings like that. Almost everyone has them especially when something like this has happened. 

I'd sit her down and tell her about your concerns about her health. Tell her you love her and all the rest, but that you want to have a full life and you're seriously worried about her. If you'd like to have children, bring up that you'd like her to be able to have the energy to play with them too. Tell her that you'll be there to help her lose the weight, you'll diet with her and that you think she can do it. Do not mention the way she looks, do not mention the sex, and don't put anything in a negative way except that she could get sick and you worry. You pretty much have to paint the weight loss like the best thing ever even if it's slightly lies. And then you have to give her the support she'll need to lose it. Ultimately losing the weight is up to her, but if you can at least provide motivation for her to start it would be helpful. 

If none of the above motivates her honestly I'd question a little what would. Surely she doesn't think her life is so bad as to slowly kill herself by eating. "
465,"Do you know for sure that all she does is ""live off him"" and that she's ""crazy""? I'm going to tell you right now that cheating and lying have a perfect 1-to-1 correlation, and she's probably neither as sponging nor as unstable as he is representing her to be.

Ask your supervisor to switch offices or projects or whatever it takes to get away from him. Start jobhunting seriously. Tell him that your little fling is over and you expect him to behave professionally toward you at work. Unfollow and block all his social media and stop texting him.

You're acting like a jerk. Stop it."

Makes sure she's taking care of herself, especially after finding out the gender, and of course herself and the baby after it's born. Has she ever helped with like baby chores before? Like changing, feeding, putting down for naps, whatever else goes into babies, toddlers, and kids? Could she start learning with you maybe? I know you have a lot on your plate but gauging your sister's ability to care for a baby while under your supervision would probably give you some idea on where her readiness and capability is at. "

A paramedic's role is to transport to a higher level of care and provide immediate life saving interventions if necessary.  A paramedic is not a doctor.  A paramedic does not have the knowledge or scope of practice to diagnose.  That belongs to doctors alone.  You transport and dump your patient off on the doc, that's the life, that's what you do.

With regards to actively managed funds vs passive funds, I'd agree with you that generally speaking passive is much easier and nets you great returns. 
The reason why is that fundamentally markets are driven by an aggregate of opinion of institutional investors (IE actively managed funds). Thus as a whole a passive fund that tracks that will on average par or out-perform the average actively managed fund"

Hell, before that it was taken for granted that girls would be married off around menarche. Adolescent sexuality isn't a recent invention. "

487,"Let me tell you this, you sound very balanced and mature even with the insecurities and trust issues that you have. That's admirable.
Now... When it comes to him being a different person with his friends, commenting on girls, going out and lying about it, I don't think he is being someone else. He is being himself. When he is with you, that is when he becomes someone else and shows you what you want to see, the qualities you want in a man. That is a big problem. A little bit of banter is fine, we all do it. But being a completely different person isn't.
Now let's talk about Thailand. He went to Thailand with a friend. Thailand is known for sex tourism and i can't being to tell you how many men i know or have heard of that go to that country for sex. Surely before he left he knew exactly what he was going to do in Thailand. You don't just go on holiday and hook up with someone by mistake or whatever because if you are on holiday somewhere with friends and you want to chill, that is exactly what you will do. If you are on holiday to pull, that is what you will do. Even if it someone hit on him, incited him, whatever... He owes you respect and he could have controlled himself. He didn't. Big mistake.
Surely he knew about your trust issues and that did not stop him from messing up. Is that really what you want for yourself? "
488,"So he doesn't respond back to you and he doesn't want a break and you are okay with all of this... right? 

Can you see why he is able to do all of this and not care about changing.

Because he is unwilling to change I would have broken up with him. Your needs are not being met purposefully and he seems to think that this is some sort of game.

My advise is to find someone mature that doesn't play with your emotions and some emotionally mature who understands that emotions are not to be played with.

But I reckon you want a magic solution to how to change him, but I wouldn't even bother. To change one must want to change.

Good luck!"

494,"Does she see a therapist? Sounds like she could have some generalized anxiety and/or mood issues. Bad periods could also be a sign of a hormonal imbalance which is usually easily fixed with a birth control pill. If she's already on one, switching might help.

Re:allergies: as someone with terrible seasonal allergies and slight asthma, these things actually really can cut down on quality of life. I've personally found an antihistamine that works pretty well for me, and if she doesn't have one that makes these things tolerable, then she can see an ear-nose-and-throat doctor for a prescription.

As far as the moaning and groaning go, it sounds like it's something she grew up doing (based on her mother's similar behavior). The good news is that learned behaviors can be unlearned! Exercise and mindfulness work can improve mood and self-awareness. Taking a yoga class together or starting a couple's morning meditation habit could be good for her.

You really should be open with her about how it all makes you feel. The more loving communication there is in a relationship, the better it will function. Approach your talk from the perspective of how the negativity affects you, instead of how it shifts your perception of her. Good luck!"
495,"A) your husband has been ""bad"" for almost his entire adult life.

B) a bad day, bad week or bad year can be written off as just a fluke. Sometimes a lot of rough things happen in a reasonably short period of time. A bad *decade* isn't a ""bad decade"", it's a pattern, a lifestyle.

C) your oldest child is 8. This ""bad decade"" father, this angry and emotionally unstable man, is the only one your kids known. IF his bad decade somehow turns into a good rest-of-his-life, its too late. You can't undo those formative years of relationship building. 

I know you're seeing how serious the issue is, and I'm really glad for it. But you need to realise that your way of looking at the situation (ie, it's only a bad decade and it will get better, you and your kids just need to wait it out) is very flawed. "

If she can see this and still not want to make a change or go to counselling then you have a huge problem on your hands.
"
498,"Yes. Her priorities have changed.

That recommendation's not a reflection on how strong or weak your relationship is, just a reality that you'll both be a lot more prepared to make a gigantic life decision after having been in a relationship (and having been an adult) for a longer time.

Basically, there's nothing to lose by waiting, even if you don't think there's much to gain, either."

I know friends who hated the person they were and decided to change that by joining crossfit and various other gyms to better themselves. Sure, they became physically better but as a result their personalities and friends group changed dramatically. Old friends got cut out while new fit friends who worked out with them, took their place. I suspect a similar thing is going on with your wife. Since you're not on board with her fitness lifestyle she takes offence to it and limits her exposure to you. This is a bad sign. ultimately if she can't talk to you or won't listen to your concerns then your marriage is dead. Before jumping on the divorce bandwagon I'd suggest asking her on a ""workout date"". Mention that you found a cool rock climbing gym or hiking trail and you'd like to do it with her this Saturday. See how she responds. She may respond positively because it's related to her new life style AND because it's showing that you are willing to work out. If she blows it off though...then try again the next week. If she continues to blow you off then you need to have a talk with her to try and get on the same page. If none of that works then you can start exploring your options for divorce."

She might be honestly lovely and seeking treatment and doing really well, but you *just don't know*. And you have no way of knowing.

If you went on a date with someone who told you there was a small but significant chance at some point they might punch you hard in the face with no warning, would you really want to keep seeing them? This is worse. The tastiest cupcake doesn't need much shit on it to make it entirely inedible. "

Yup. These are ALL tactics, they have been used by every addict and alcoholic and manipulator since the dawn of time. And they are effective, because they punch you right in that big, shiny, red ""GUILT"" button you have in your forehead.  
 
My cousin and ex-friend (who I no longer talk to) did the same thing to me when I cut her out of my life for good. She used the same tactics. At the time, it gutted me. Like you, I felt like a monster. How could I be so cruel? How could I be so heartless and hurt this person I loved so much? This family member I grew up with, who relied on me for a job, and money, and help, and socializing, and navigating through life? 

Yeah. She's fine. Oh, she left me 1000 sobbing, desperate voice mails about how her life was an absolute disaster, and so on. We saw each other at the grocery store, and she immediately transformed into a shivering, hunched-over, round-eyed wretch, like an orphan who had never known kindness in her life.

Silly Melissa. 

Your ex is manipulating you. Even you know it now, and you're starting to get to that point that I got to with Melissa, like ""Oh, Bra-VO, that was a GREAT performance, can you do it again, but this time, can you blame me for your awful childhood, too?""

Reason being, pretty much every person I've ever met in my life that leads off with ""I'm a blunt person"" or ""I just tell it like it is""...is, for lack of a better word...difficult to be around.

555,I would argue however that not sharing the horrible things you've SEEN is different than not sharing the horrible things you DID.
556,Yep. Paralegals (in situations I know of) learn on the job and are trained by the law firm.  Paralegals with a certificate and the ones without are pretty equal in starting salary and how they are treated on day one.  Law firms want people with good research and writing skills plus organizational skills and strong work ethic.

559,"No offense, but very few cheaters start out thinking ""I'm going to cheat on my spouse today!"" They start out with innocent crushes that they choose to pursue, months go by, eventually a compromising situation comes up. 

It's easy to say you'd never let anything escalate to that level, but you've already escalated from ""crush on a coworker from a distance"" to ""crush on a friend that I talk to regularly and get a rush from seeing"". "
560,"&gt;I forgot my license had expired about a month prior, and also I had no idea that I had a brake light and my license plate light out.

I'd argue about whether you should be keeping on top of at least your license renewal but what's done is done, you dropped the ball here.

&gt; He flat out refused when I asked if he wanted me to borrow money on his behalf, and he didn't want me to tell my dad that he was involved at all, because he wants to be in my life for the long haul and doesn't want to risk potential judgment from in-laws down the road

It was your fault this happened so I don't know why your dad would be negative towards him if you've already told him the first half of the story.

You're already doing what I would have suggested, just by being there as a positive influence on him.

&gt;Every lawyer and friend I've spoken to about this has reassured me that we likely won't get any jail time, we more likely will get fined (up to $1k), probation/some kind of conditional release program, and there's a chance I'll get my license suspended.

If those fines and conditional releases happen, is your boyfriend in a position where he can pay that fine and carry out the program? If so, finding a lawyer may not be on the forefront of his mind, but fighting for his existing job would be.

I'd just keep doing what you're doing, once the court date has passed you'll have more information to re-examine your options with how severe/light your charges are."
561,I feel like OP is just trolling. This can't be real.

563,"It sounds like he conned you. He got stuff out of the relationship with you monetarily (laptop, dentures, medication, etc.) and he did attack you, which caused 700 dollars worth of damage. That may be enough to get a restraining order. Hell if you just feel unsafe in general, you could get a restraining order. He has threatened you before and now that he's been exposed, he may be unpredictable.

I'm sorry you're going through this. Therapy would be a great option amd they can help your daughter too. Maybe ask her if any of her classmates lie for fun, use that as a stepping stone to explain what happened."

I would not be able to be in a relationship with someone who had such a vastly different schedule to me. And I personally refuse to work any job that requires weekend work because I would never see my partner.

The best thing you can do is encourage your mom to get into therapy. She needs to rebuild her identity and self-esteem after 35 years of abuse and break the cycle of co-dependency. And you're not going to be able to do that for her. She needs to do it for herself with the help of a professional."

579,"You can end it by sending the letter.
 
You can end it by sending a text.

You can end it by calling him.

You can end it in person. 

There is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" way to break up with him as far as how you do it. There are *safe* and *unsafe* ways to do this, though, and you're the best judge of what feels safe to you.

Remember: break-ups are not negotiations. This is not something you need to explain to him, or justify to him, or defend against accusations, or argue about. You are breaking up with him, and he doesn't need to agree with it or understand it, he just has to accept it. 

When you break up with him, tell him that it's not up for discussion, and that you don't want any contact with him for a while afterwards; he shouldn't call or text or email you unless you contact him first. If there are any logistics (your stuff at his place, or vice-versa) then find a friend you trust, and ask if they would be comfortable picking up boxes of your stuff and/or delivering boxes of his stuff. You go no-contact: block his number if need be, unfollow/unfriend/block on all social media, and filter his emails so you never see them and they're automatically forwarded to your friend-that-handles-logistics. (she doesn't need to respond to the emails either, just read them and make sure there's nothing dangerous going on. Threats are bad, ""hey, I have a check for the money I owe you"" is good, but neither of those things you should have to deal with right now) "
580,Based on what you said in this post. Yes
581,But did you have a date that was a SO at the sister's wedding? That is something that could drastically change the dynamic of the situation.
582,"How about your first happy marriage?

How about your first partner that you grow old with?

Your first partner that you visit Thailand with? Or Rome? Or hell, Boston?


Don't get fixated on the firsts. Milestones come in every relationship but in different ways, and you have to appreciate the memories and feelings that come with each day with each person (sorry if that sounds like a greeting card).

Stop focusing on his past and focus on your future together. There are a million things that a person could never hope to do in a hundred lifetimes, don't tell me there's no novelty left for you two. Get out there and make your own novelty, and again, focus on the present and future, stop drawing comparisons to the past.

EDIT: And remember, he picked you. He *chose* not to be with his ex-wife, and there's good reason for that, it sounds like. He *chose* to date you, and to be with you now. He's picking you every day and not picking her every day. Focus on that to rid yourself of jealousy."
583,"First off, you can literally break up with someone for any reason you want. 

Second, your BF handles these women hitting on him in a way that is VERY disrespectful. You don't stay friends with random women who hit on you unless your SO is okay with it, because the foundation for any ""friendship"" *with these women* is sexual interest. 

He really doesn't sound ready to be in a relationship. "
584,"&gt; Am I wrong? 

No. Don't change for a woman. Change for yourself, or not at all."
585,"Dude. No one thinks it's necessarily too early to bring him to a wedding, Everyone thinks your expectations of mindreading and the situation itself are going to cause trouble.

588,"I think OP is interested in having family time, not couple time - but I could be wrong. "
589,"Your title's a bit misleading there.

I understand that stuff loses a lot of context when written down, but it does genuinely sound like something that might be misinterpreted. Most couples in their 30s have to work hard to maintain a healthy weight, and I have commiserated with my girlfriend using similar words on more than one occasion.

Your weight is obviously a hot-button issue, and in that context a boyfriend of 1 year should know better than to make a comment like that. But are you sure he was being malicious?

If it was a one-off comment I'd probably put it down to foot-in-mouth syndrome."
590,"&gt; Imagine two nights a week at the gym, or the library, or reading at a cafe, no kids, no husband. Doesn't that sound awesome? You'll have to hire a housekeeper bc he won't tidy up while he's home with the kids.

This comment sounds like an individual, who is single, NOT married (w/kids), or is in an unhappy relationship. "

594,"I somewhat agree with you but in public, you have no expectation or privacy. 

When I'm taking pictures of my kids at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C., I'm not going to ask everybody who could possibly be in the view if I can take a picture or not. 

I don't think what they're doing is rude, I think it's harmless &amp; it's an inside joke but without any malice or ill-intent. 

I guess my point is if you don't want your picture taken, don't go out in public. A picture of my self is taken a lot by strangers, who like my tattoos, or perhaps I resembled somebody a person knew so they snapped a pic. I don't see the big deal in that. Also, when I was 17 I looked exactly like Britney Spears (she &amp; I are the same age) &amp; I went backpacking across Europe &amp; even a little bit in Africa, my picture was taken soooooo many times without my permission. It's not a big deal. 

It's not like they're taking pictures &amp; making fun of people. They're all just taking pictures that resemble their friends husband. "
595,"counterpoint here, while your husband is now crossing a line the reason your aunt keeps pulling stunts like this is *becasue* no one calls her out on her bullshit.

For 70 years she gets to act this way, no one says anything and she *still* gets invited to family functions. When the next birthday party or wedding rolls around will auntie awful still get invited? If yes then *she's won*.

**no one in your family stood up for your daughter**, you are all enablers. Have you ever heard about the broken stair? One step is broken, so the family starts stepping over it, hopping over it. Years go by and stepping over the broken stair is second nature, everyone knows it's there and knows to step around it. A broken stair has been normalized, people stop thinking about fixing it. But when someone outside the family climbs the stairs, a broken step is really obvious problem. It needs to be fixed, someone could get hurt. It seems absurd that an entire family has been hopping over this broken step for the past 30 years."
596,"And for good measure: go to HR to report J's inappropriate behavior. Despite your efforts to downplay what he's doing, he's being EXTREMELY unprofessional and obviously your decision to ignore him hasn't made the situation go away. This needs to END.

I know it may seem easier to let this ""blow over"" but clearly he's not getting the message and frankly the earlier in his life he learns the lesson that this behavior is unprofessional, the sooner he can fix it."
597,"Would you have been so passive if she said"" Ok, family picture time!  The gays can't be in it"".?

You should have done more in the moment.  Now, I'm curious as to why your husband that is 16 years younger than you is doing coke and fighting with an old woman when he has a young child to take care of.  You too should be worried about this.

I'm a big gay rights guy, but you are help to a certain expectation.  Any person against gay marriage would see this post as rationale to their beliefs."

600,"I actually think you need to inform the police right now about this guy, either in person at the station or via the non-emergency line. He's approached you three times already, and is making you feel trapped and unsafe in your own neighbourhood. That's not something you should have to put up with, OP.

As others have already said, if he follows you again loudly tell him that you're uncomfortable and that he needs to leave you alone. Make it loud enough so that people around you can hear, but keep it succinct; you don't want to engage with this guy for any longer than is necessary. If he protests go straight to a nearby place where there is security present and inform them what's going on.

I'm so sorry you're in this situation. I had a very brief incident myself with a guy a few years ago, which wasn't even in the same ballpark as your situation, but I remember the wave of nausea whenever I saw him all too well and can definitely sympathise. Stay safe."
601,"My college roommate was a stripper. She earned a lot of money because she had an excellent memory - she remembered guys' names, jobs, relationship statuses and everything if they tipped well. She had a regular whose pregnant wife thought he was at ""business dinners"" while the guy was buying private dances. She knew all of the baby names that this regular and his wife were considering. A stripper remembering that you told her you were single and giving you a kiss means about as much as a Starbucks barista telling you to have a nice day.

&gt;I'm scared all the emotion I'm feeling will pass and I'll just bottle this up and not tell her again like always. 

Don't you dare. You lied to this woman about wanting kids and cheated on her. You know perfectly well that you'll keep going to strip clubs. If you want to pretend that this stripper sees you as anything more than a particularly pathetic ATM then you're free to lie yourself. But don't keep deceiving an honest human being who has trusted you.

You should tell your girlfriend the truth and break up with her. You've done horrible things but you have a chance to at least do the right thing now. So do the decent thing and let her go find someone who will love her the way that she loves you.

602,It is a rare person who is mature enough to know their limit with alcohol on their 22nd birthday. Give the poor girl a break. Christ. 
603,I honestly reacted the way I did (telling him to gtfo) because he was towering over me and screaming while I had our kid in my arms. He was too close and it felt uncomfortable and tbh scary. My dad was abusive to my mom and my siblings and I and it reminded me of his shit. 
604,"&gt; Even if your wife wants to control when Alice hears about LGBT issues, she will most likely hear about it sooner from her friends when she asks questions.

Exactly. When Alice goes to school, she's probably going to have kids in her class who have same sex parents. Or is OP's wife going to homeschool her? Is she going to monitor her access to media so she doesn't see anything with gay characters? Even kids' shows have characters with two moms or two dads. The idea that she can prevent her daughter from learning about homosexuality until she's in middle school is very impractical; I think learning about it in an age-appropriate way from a family member isn't the worst outcome."
605,"I ended a 7yr relationship this January for the very same reasons, so I understand your frustrations. Exbf has the pace of a snail, and no matter what I said or did (even my friends had brought up the topic of marriage), he still wouldn't budge. e.g. Whenever I talked about getting engaged and buying a house, he'd respond with 'I don't have any money' but had bought his mother the latest iPad and upgraded his computer rig (which cost him thousands). So many more examples that I rage whenever I think about them. Bottomline, he just wouldn't grow up with me, even though he said we would eventually marry and have kids. But eventually never came. I felt stuck and miserable being with him. In the end, I left him and the country and I don't regret a thing. Also, it was probably for the best as the relationship has ran its course. I felt relief when I broke up with him. I could breathe again and I've never felt better in my life."
606,"Beat me too it. MA is still pretty racist. Mostly the type that would not do physical harm (i.e. aren't going to commit a hate crime or go on a rant on the subway although of course we have that too) but still say and think racist stuff. And I'm not trying to say thats not extremely harmful- just that I think that's how mass residents try to convince themselves that they are not racist- because the KKK isn't riding around up here they pat themselves on the back. Bills rant is textbook MA racist- probably you thought he was a stand up guy because there were no POC in your friend group, and he is probably perfectly pleasant to the ""right"" POC. "
607,"That part caught my eye too. He's not just an asshole, he's an incredibly ignorant and untrustworthy asshole. "
608,"My buddy is Hindu and his family doesn't eat meat, but he does when he's with his friends and stuff. Idk if that's just their own personal thing though. "
609,"This morning, I accidentally poured salt into my coffee. They're in the same type of dispenser so it's a mistake I occasionally make. You could say I just need to label them better, or put them in different places, but at the end of the day, I'm lazy and it's one cup of coffee every now and then. 

Nevertheless, I didn't realize my mistake until I got in the car and was driving to work. Salty coffee is TERRIBLE. The taste doesn't leave your mouth for like an hour. If I had to be waterboarded, I'd request salty coffee so I'd just die instead of enduring torture. I spit it out of the window and cursed my poor decisions.

The terrible salty coffee flavor lingered for miles. As I got closer to work, I thought about getting more coffee and ridding my mouth of the terrible taint of salty accident coffee.....and then reached instinctually for my cup of coffee and drank more of the salty coffee because I'm a fucking idiot like that.

Me drinking salty coffee twice in a row wasn't as stupid as what she just proposed, and not even half as dumb as you'll be if you believe any bit of what she says.

BREAK. UP. WITH. THIS. LYING. LIAR."
610,"&gt;My wife has a history of being physically and emotionally abusive

&gt;went in-patient in a psychiatric hospital last year, and came out largely the same. She drinks, lies, and manipulates, does not work, and creates a very hostile environment at home directed towards me.

&gt;Divorce would be a mistake, financially for both of us, developmentally for our kids, and emotionally for our whole family.

Actually, remaining married to this woman would be a mistake on all counts, but especially for your kids. If you think they're not being fucked up by witnessing this abusive relationship, you're deluding yourself.

I can't in good conscience advise you on how to work things out with your wife because that would be terrible for you and for your kids. 

Divorce is difficult. I know. I've been there. There are also times when it's the best possible outcome for everyone. This is one of those times.

611,"You acknowledge that your relationship with Vanessa is entirely inappropriate, you seem way too emotionally attached to her, and you want to know how to see her behind your girlfriends back? Yikes dude "
612,"I'm not so sure, her fiancee putting his hands on the baby might possibly qualify for one, since he isn't a parent.  I was thinking really more along the lines of if he makes any kind of threat when she dumps him.  I'm not advocating her lying about it, but if she told him he was out and threatened her and dad happened to be nearby she'd have a witness which would probably make it pretty easy."
613,"You need to learn to be polite in saying an absolute no because being both is not mutually exclusive. You're mistaking listening to her as your job. It's not. You're just coworkers and you don't have to do anything that annoys you. Keep sentences short without any explanations. ""Sorry, we're busy on Wednesday."" ""Hey, I'm really busy right now, can we chat later."" No need to add on anything which can misconstrued as an invitation. No need to listen to her chatter at all. Get a pair of headphones if you must to discourage her. Smile politely and look away to end the conversation."
614,Honestly it seems like you think very highly of yourself and expect perfection in return. Ya that's not going to happen cause no one is perfect.  I've met plenty of women who are crass and quick witted. And it almost comes across as you see yourself as above dating.  What kind of dates are you going on?  Are you bailing after 1-3 dates?  People don't really open up in a short time frame. 
615,"I'd advise you to stop calling it ""Gamer Rage"". Normal, understandable ""Gamer Rage"" is task-based frustration that tells a player they need to take a break, and get some chips, maybe try a different task for a while... Your brother isn't do that. Your brother is an aggressive bully who is engaging in verbal abuse and leaving the people near him fearful of physical violence.

Calling it ""Gamer Rage"" excuses it and makes it about his legitimate hobby. It's not about the hobby, the hobby is fine. Most people could spend their free time gaming—but maybe be can't because he is the problem, not the game.

You can't really help your brother until he acknowledges the problem, and as a sibling, you don't even have the power your parents do to create rules or boundaries. The best thing you can do right now is to stop excusing it and start labelling the behaviour more accurately. He's not 'being frustrated' or 'having gamer rage', he's insulting his girlfriend. He is engaging in verbal abuse. He is behaving irrationally. He is damaging relationships. He's failing to regulate his behaviour *towards other people* in his life. People he supposedly cares for. You are fearful he may become violent. This is not healthy or normal.  This is bullying and a totally irrational, unhealthy level of aggression.

Good grades don't mean you get to drive drunk or punch people. They don't excuse what he's doing either."
616,Depends. Did OP hear it from the bf or the friend? Maria might have said he's on board without even have telling him.
617,"They both let you know, I think that's about as good as it gets man. You need to get over the insecurity of it or risk losing her. "
618,"Can he claim ignorance as an employee of the store though? Think there's some ""oh shit I'm crappy at my job"" compounding this also? "
619,"Thanks, but I am pretty confident this is a mental health issue. It's been recurring throughout his whole life, and his sisters have told me he had similar issues as a child."
620,I know it's a final sale and they can't be returned.  But I would still call the store anyway and see if they'd let you exchange them for identical items in the correct size. 
621,"It is really sad. And I had NO IDEA. We were kids. When she told me later (just a few years ago, we reconnected on Facebook) I was stunned and saddened and I felt terrible. She had no idea how to tell anyone (or even that she could, he was emotionally abusive as well, and threatened her). 

She had severe allergies and I had cats and dogs. If she spent even an hour in my house (and she tried, so many times) her eyes would water and run, her nose would run, her face would puff up, and she couldn't breathe. She tried every allergy pill on the market (not many back then) but nothing really helped. 
 
I wish I had known. "
622,"&gt; I agree about weddings being a relationship crucible. Planning a wedding is extremely stressful and brought out sides of myself and my parents that I had never seen before.

I'd like to chime in here and say I felt the wedding planning was extremely easy - at least compated to the rest of the relationship 13 years down the road, after kids, financial concerns, sudden deaths in the family, etc.

One of our best decisions was following a model of ""You pick your top three choices and then get the other person to comment on just those three"".  Sets things up so that I didn't have to review 1.2^e6 wedding invitations (etc) but I still was contributing my opinion and we felt on the same page."
623,"I don't see why Luke and you need to be there at all.

I would brief Sarah thoroughly on HOW bad she is and then both of you stay away from bad mom.



Honestly, there just are people like Sarah who never read the news and assume all families could become like the waltons with just a smile and a kind word. And they are tiresomely naive. Don't get sucked in

I would strongly advise Luke not to attend, and if he DOES, keep someone outside in a car with the engine running. I'm not exaggerating. Luke should not be expected to do this, and IMHO Jack is being foolish and naive and selfish to ask him to

And about the wedding: brief everyone that it is secret and hire security.

But really, the best way is for Sarah to wake the fuck up to the truth, and abandon her waltons fantasy - because thats all it is, a fantasy"
624,"I have to second the whole possible-MIL as landlord thing is something that would be weird and might end badly for everyone.

If you don't mind renting to the GF I would tell your son that you would prefer to talk to the GF directly. He's not the possible tenant and you would have to do all of the normal things you do when you rent out the condo and that you were planning on renting out the condo -full price - when he moved back to London. 

As something to consider depending on where the GF is on the income spectrum of 100k+, 4k for a one bedroom one bath might actually not be in her budget. If she's more towards 100k than 200k you have to think about what is being taken as taxes, groceries, rent, and utilities. Of course I don't live in NYC, I've had a friend live there, so NYC dwellers will have a better take."

626,"Whatever your actual emotional needs are, you aren't wrong for having them.  I think it's pretty clear, though, that this man isn't capable of fulfilling them.  So it's not really a question of if you should be mad or how do you make him understand you, that's all kind of besides the point.  He has made clear what he is offering, and the ball is really in your court to decide if that's enough for you, or if it isn't.  If it isn't, then it is likely time for a breakup so you can both find people better suited to your needs."
627,"How are you able to still be married to him?  He sounds awful and DOES NOT CARE THAT HE HURTS YOU.

There are many things a couple can compromise on, but this unassuming incompatibility may sow resentment like any other. It's like having different sleep schedules, or wanting to live rurally instead of in the city. How much time do you spend organizing, shopping, prepping, &amp; cooking meals? That is a lot of missed bonding time. How many important life events revolve around a meal?  This is why vegetarians have an easier time dating other vegetarians. This is why people with celiac disease date each other. She may be happier with someone who isn't always pushing to eat things that take her outside her comfort/health.

Which I would be rushing home to get date night started, but that's date night for me. I also plan in detail, including times, places, everything, with my SO involved in the conversation. Including ""so think you can be home by X and out the door by Y?""

Which sounds like a lot. But we got into that habit because of a situation where a weekly date night was needed. Where we needed time just us 2, away from the house and our normal lives, to look each other in the eye and actually have a conversation. It takes work and that extra planning is that work needed. Even if it's just one side doing it at first. 

Before that, OP NEEEDS to talk to his wife about why a date night is important and why she needs to care and work at it before thier marriage is dead. It seems she either doesn't know or doesn't care. "

I am the eldest of that last bunch. We never specifically point out that we are only half siblings. At the end of the day we are siblings. By just referring to your baby brother as ""brother"" you are not lying in any way.

If someone asks about the age difference between you both, ""Well my mom remarried then had him."" Any one can infer that you biologically only share your moms DNA. 

By going out of your way in pointing out he is ""only a half brother"" you make him seem less important. Quit trying to argue semantics about the titles assigned to this baby. He is your brother. End of story. "
658,"&gt; It was all less forced and scheduled, which can put a lot of pressure on performing and make it feel more exhausting than it should be. This leads to one or the other of you not being satisfied.

I think that's true for you, but for other people, having that time set aside for sex takes away the pressure to figure out when to ask and then deal with being turned down if you're the one with the higher libido.

It appears that the first sex they have in the week is where he gets off and she doesn't.  That's super unsatisfying and demoralizing, like her needs literally don't matter, when she is the one with the higher libido.  Having a plan for the week's sexual encounters might not be as much of a problem if she was actually getting satisfied."

I got married at 22 and separated/started divorce proceedings at 25. I dated around for a bit and while I'll admit the novelty was fun at first, it really wore off after a short time. Then I met my ""one"" and I would never ever trade the novelty of dating around for what I have with him. And yeah, seriously, everyone I dated had baggage, and I have it too.

I certainly hope it's not the inevitable worst cases we can envision, but be aware of such possibilities. Him being quite ready to fuck with a child there on the bed... well, be suspicious.

If even their being with him to begin with is dodgy, then you need to look at this with open eyes.

Just because the kids have hobbies and grades does not mean they aren't also slowly building anxiety and resentment over time on the inside. Growing up like this fucking sucks. My father left when I was young, all I wanted was to have an adult in my life that could shield me. These kids should have that but instead their mother is so enabling and delusional that she honestly thinks that ""this works for them"" and that her kids are somehow developed enough to deal with this. I'm sorry if I'm being extremely harsh but fuck my life what I would have given for someone to just take me away from that shit situation when I was a kid and to allow me to be a child instead of someone who had to take care of my mother's emotions and my younger siblings all the time.

694,"Honesty  I think your views on how a marriage should work are perfectly healthy and normal. I'm completely baffled that your husband doesn't feel the need to be there to support you during this trying time for your family. I wouldn't be able to go off on a vacation with friends while knowing that my spouse is dealing with a pretty difficult situation back home all by herself without being able to rely on me. And I'm not even talking about the fact that you had plans to go there next year on a very special trip together which makes it a lot worse.

OP is it the first time that your husband has behaved that way? Because I find him pretty selfish and I'm wondering if he's ever shown that character trait before."

696,"There's more than one issue here.

Your partner seems like he's all sorts of problems when it comes to financial matters. Did you get these sorted after breaking up? If not, then you should not be back with him.

As for keeping track of money, the only way to be crystal clear is to keep a budget, set up a spreadsheet to track all income and expenditure. If you are doing this already and things aren't adding up, as you thought before... end this. You can't be with someone you can't trust. There seem issues enough with him."
697,"I would be wary of this ^

698,Wow you're really out to get me aren't you. I just realized you keep commenting the same thing over and over.
699,"&gt; Lina has been in therapy for 2+ years but it hasn't made a bit of difference.

This concerns me. Assuming your assessment is accurate, a lack of progress after two years is a huge red flag. 

How many therapists did Lina meet with before she chose to become a client of this therapist? How frequently does Lina go to therapy? Does Lina tell you anything about what is discussed in therapy? Has Lina expressed to you how she feels about therapy? Do you know if the therapist has expressed concern that Lina isn't making progress?

Therapy can be very beneficial but it requires a good therapist and a good therapist-client relationship. There are not-so-effective therapists out there, and not every therapist is right for every person.

The fact that you haven't seen any progress in two years suggests that there is an issue with Lina's therapist and/or therapy.

&gt; When Lina went to the bathroom, she pulled me aside and very casually told me that I need to get her to go NC with her father. There was no other way. She said to find a way to do it and she'll manage the therapy side. She walked off and that was that.

The therapist might very well be correct that the healthiest thing for Lina to do is to cut off contact with her father but do you have any idea why she told you to ""find a way to do it""? Helping Lina see the wisdom in distancing herself from her unhealthy relationship with her father *is* ""the therapy side.""

Frankly, the therapist's behavior is very concerning for a number of reasons. Most importantly, ethical concerns aside, it suggests to me that the therapist is not effective and instead of recognizing that and addressing it, she is essentially asking you to do her job for her.

I would strongly advise that you and Lina reconsider whether this therapist is a good fit."

Good first step. 

&gt; it would be very difficult for me to breakup with her over this

Then don't. 

&gt; but the thought that she chose this other more exciting guy over me before settling for me is kind of eating away at me.

She didn't. She chose you. You were in competition with someone else and you ultimate won-out. You aren't the last man on earth and she wasn't compelled to date either you or A; she could have selected anyone else. But she didn't. She selected you.

714,"Some tiny acknowledgement which shows you read the message, but don't care to communicate, would be the best way to keep her from trying other ways to contact you.

But the reverse is also true, and for me, it hits me like a bag of bricks. As soon as I see someone behave meanly or be condescending (as a trend, not just a one-off bad day) I will, almost instantly, start to notice all the lines in their face. Their lumps and bumps, their grey hairs, their slightly off-color teeth will all be so prominent, and they could be super models but to me, they'll look like a witch. Just... ugly. As ugly as they are on the inside. 

The concept of beauty is just so complex. I have found that it's a lot less about looking good and more about being good. You might not turn heads, but you'll have a network of people just as lovely as you that are loyal and true. "
718,"I've been exactly there. You can't convince her to respect you, you can only force her to treat you properly.  

You need to move out. I'd recommend as soon as possible. Find some roommates this summer and get out and start building independence.  

If that's truly impossible, at least work hard to plan for next fall when you can.  When you move out, you need to stop telling them where you're going and what you're doing and who you're seeing.  Don't let them drive down every weekend. By which I mean, don't see them. Tell them you'd be happy to see them, say, once a month, but the rest of the time you need to be busy studying. Then if they drive down anyway, you tell them you're busy studying, as you said, and you have no time to spend with them. Yes, shut the door in their face.  
Don't take calls more than you want to. Once every few days or whatever amount you think acceptable. any other than that, you ignore until the designated time.  Have your own separate phone plan, and don't enable any location-sharing.  

The only way to deal with someone like your mother is simply leaving, living your adult life, and forcing her to deal with it. But you need to be out of the house to start doing that.  "
719,"He didn't listen to her though. He listened as far as ""OP wants a dog"". He didn't listen to all her talks about being ready for the dog, getting her work schedule lined up, wanting to meet the dog, or getting training laid out. OP was clearly very prepared for how she wanted to acquire and raise this dog. 

Agreed that OP has extra emotions playing into this situation. Really seems like a last straw. I just feel bad for her because now that the bf has adopted this dog out from under her, she has no legal right to the dog she wanted when/if she leaves. "

I'd say that's more than enough time to prove she's turned over a new leaf.  She also was suffering from depression, which it sounds like she's moved past, thereby removing a major factor in her self-damaging behavior.

If/when she starts showing signs of changing, then OP can worry about it.  But there is nothing at all to indicate any red flags on that front."
721,"I was in a similar situation to you, with my ex-husband.  I know exactly what you are saying here, but try and remember you might actually be doing him a favor.  Sometimes divorce makes you consider what you did to screw it up (it should make you think that, everyone contributes) so that you don't repeat it with the next person.

Some people never get it, like my ex.  He still doesn't know what he did wrong, but hey.  He had the opportunity to learn and he wasn't going to learn it by me dying an emotional death continuing to pick up his goddamn socks."

725,"If you guys signed a lease then she can't just be kicked out regardless of the fact that you/your parents are the landlord(s).

It sounds like you're placing a lot of unfair expectations on Zoe. No one person is going to be your end all be all for anything and it's important to remember that Zoe signed up to be a roommate, not a friend, and she's fufilled that requirement.

Why don't you focus on making some new friends outside of Zoe? Join a club or try something new, it can be hard being shy but it's not impossible."

729,"It's real funny to me when people make posts in this sub and get all hurt when no one agrees with them, or more pathetically, grasps at the few who do agree despite how obviously wrong they are. I'd say more but it's clear you won't listen and will keep your head buried in the sand. You are acting incredibly creepy and it's funny you talk about people replying not having empathy when you're on the cusp of fucking up someone's living situation, which you also clearly don't understand because you're so spoiled, which is enormously unsympathetic."
730,"So you were 17 and he was 21 when you first got together? He was finding his feet as an adult and you were just leaving your teens...

My dad buys my mum clothes she doesn't like. She wears them otherwise they cause an argument. This is one of many unhealthy traits in my parents relationship, but my mum figures they've been married 30+ years she'll stick with it. Sunk cost fallacy.

I guess the question is, are there any other controlling behaviours? Small ones that didn't seem a big deal at the time. If so, this may be a sign of an unhappy future.

If not, he was just excited to see you in a dress he thought you liked, and was disappointed when you didn't wear it. He communicated his problem to you the next day so that's a good thing. Only you'll know if this is a one off or an evolving pattern."
731,"That's incredibly unfair. If the parents stayed together, regardless of how unhappy they were in the marriage, it would have more negative affects than positive on both them and their child."

734,"It really does depend on the context. The skinhead movement was very popular for a time - and originally wasn't a racist movement (hell, punk originates from ska and dancehall music). 

My advice would be to just acknowledge it. It was a different time, and they were different people. From what OP is saying, the family is not racist and completely supportive of the relationship so I think it would be a real shame to hang their past over them like this - especially considering it's no longer relevant.

737,"&gt;He is a very complicated man.

He's not complicated.  There's nothing complicated about being an abusive sack of garbage.  

You need to cut him off completely, or this will never stop.  Even if you *do* cut him off, it may never stop - people like this don't like it when you get free of their claws.  You need to start thinking in terms of protecting yourself.  Take some self-defense courses, etc.  Forget about any kind of relationship with him - your **safety** is what's important.  Make it a priority.  "
738,"People have difficulty accepting that they are the bad guy in the story. Cheating is a shitty thing to do, so they have to convince themselves that their partner deserved it somehow - that they drove them to cheat and made them into this terrible person. Combine that with the fact that they see how easy it is to cheat and get away with it, it's easy for them to believe that their partner must also be cheating. "
739,"I'm not going to deny the importance of physical intimacy in a romantic relationship, but entering into this marriage, it wasn't as important as all of the other good stuff you do with your husband.  You have to find your way back to the priorities and values you had entering the marriage, which means spending more of your time planning and acting on those things, rather than sinking into your fantasies.

It is also helpful to not couch this feeling in the moralistic thinking of him not wanting to improve himself.  By saying that, you are trying to feed yourself justification and rationalization for the hurt you know that infidelity would cause him.  You are, whether you realize it or not, trying to make it seem like you have no agency here, like it is your moral obligation to dole out punishment by way of infidelity for him not getting into shape.  But, that's not true.  You aren't a victim. You aren't trapped.  You have the ability to make choices.  I get it.  You want to enjoy a kind of experience that may not have been previously available to you before you made changes to your appearance, and you're frustrated that your marriage is an obstacle to letting you have that experience.  However, that's not a reason to cheat; that's a reason to either work harder on your marriage or get a divorce."

742,"But besides that mrs lincoln, how was the play?"
743,"I think it's a bit more than reckless. You need to not be married and grow up a little more. All these things you just *loved* about him you now hate. You loved he was talkative, now he just drones on. You loved how he'd do anything for the woman he loves, now you call it a lack of self-respect. He cooks for you, you don't appreciate it. You don't like his friends.

He hasn't changed here, you have. And all those judgments? That's what people who love their spouse do. I'm grateful when my wife cooks, and she is when I do. If she was unappreciative, I'd quit. And I'd do anything for her. Anything. Because she's my wife. That isn't a lack of self-respect, that's putting her wants/needs ahead of my own. And there's a LOT of that in a long term marriage.

I'm seriously trying to come off not too judgmental here, but how you talk about his ""man-boy"" friends then follow up to go hang out and smoke weed with your gal pals really speaks volumes. End this for his sake, and take a little time working on yourself."
744,"This is what's know as a ""dominant/submissive"" dynamic. I would talk to her and see if she's just looking for this to spice up your sex life, or if it goes beyond that. Some couples do participate in this type of dynamic 24/7, but that's an extreme end of the spectrum.

747,"DO NOT GHOST ON HIM. 

My best friend's wife did that to him. The only good to come out of it is that he got to file an annulment (based on 'fraud' on her end) instead of an at-fault divorce (with her at fault) which probably would have caused her to lose custody of her (not his) kids. 


Have an adult conversation with him. You **owe it to him** because he is your husband and he legally can't leave this situation easily. It's not like breaking up with a boyfriend where it's shitty of you to just coast away from it. You are in a *legal* contract with this guy and it will hugely impact his life. 


If it's that bad, get a lawyer and ask about starting an annulment on your side or taking the blame for something so he can file for one. 


I'm guessing the whole time leading up to this your friends and family (and his) thought the quick marriage was a bad idea and you refused to listen? Because they were right he was just a rebound?"
748,The room rescue is such a cute idea!!
749,"Is he doing chores, too?  It's not clear from your post and comments so far that he's doing the same amount.  

If the rule is ""clean it when it needs it,"" then he should be cleaning it when he thinks it needs it.  Not waiting for you to clean it when he thinks it needs it."
750,"I wouldn't take her back. I'd send her a message that stated after everything she did, said, and called me these past few days, I want nothing to do with her again. She's shown that she has zero sympathy or empathy for someone that's physically ill, and is willing to berate you repeatedly for an honest to god accident. She can find someone else to hurl abuse at because you're not coming back. She can pay for her own hotel, find her own way home, and never speak to you again."
751,"You have been with two men in your life, but think you are qualified to determine there are only three types of men in bed and what they are? LOL. 

Tell you husband you are unhappy with your sex life with him and that you want more foreplay. Better foreplay. Explain to him exactly what you want. Hire a babysitter and take him out for dinner. Get him in the mood. 

Try r/sex."
752,"It's a little weird to have a preference of sex for other people's babies, though. I mean, if it's not your kid, why would it matter to you at all? "
753,"It could be, but the most important part is whether he's willing to get help or not (and he's not). You're not responsible for your illness, but you ARE responsible for your treatment. He doesn't want to get help - getting him into therapy is a noble idea but if he doesn't *really want* to get better, he won't. Period. 

**Please do not even consider bringing another child into this situation.** Don't put him or yourself above an innocent life."
754,"Oh honey, you don't know what love is. I don't mean that in a rude or condescending way. I mean it honestly as in this boy is terrible and using you and what you have for him is not love, I promise. Love is a million times better than this and you will have it someday. Not with him. You deserve so much better. "
755,"This is gonna sound a bit blunt but if you even need to ask if all this stuff is normal relationship behavior then you are not remotely ready to have relationships.

756,It feels a lot like you're really trying to poke holes in his allergy so you don't have to take it seriously. Either abstain from nuts or break up. 
757,"Its kind of ironic that your boyfriend, who is trying to get you to enforce boundaries, is the absolute perfect example of someone you need to enforce boundaries against. There are 2 issues here.

1) You don't enforce boundaries. You let people steal from you and treat you poorly because you say its easier than standing up for yourself. And this likely means that people don't worry about stealing from you and treating you poorly because they've never had any sort of repercussion from doing so. Without a doubt you need to work on this or you will always be in a cycle where someone is taking advantage of you and you just let them because its easier than stopping them.

2) Your boyfriend is doing exactly the thing that he sees other people do to you. He is overstepping boundaries by a lot. He puts you in situations you explicitly told him you didn't want to be in. And then he does it over and over again because you refuse to enforce boundaries. And now it just came to a boiling point because he put you in a specifically tough spot.

Solutions:

Don't let your friends steal your clothes. Tell them they return them or get the police called on them.

If someone creates a hostile work environment, try to end that hostile work environment.

If your step dad is attempting to steal, yes steal, the money you put into a car don't let him.

if your boyfriend won't respect your boundaries, fucking dump him.

Please learn to stand up for yourself when you need to. Life will be a lot easier when you feel comfortable confronting people who are trying to hurt you."
758,"I completely agree.

Absolutely horrible ultimatum.  She needs to understand that it is completely and utterly unacceptable.

I have to imagine that his trust in his wife is very shaken right now."
759,"Totally fine to have standards, rules, conditions, etc. It's your life. I would add though that you should be pretty upfront about it so it doesn't become a problem two months in. "
760,"No, sending him money was not okay. But he doesn't have the right to threaten to cut her off from the family finances for speaking to someone he forbid her to. That is the controlling and abusive part."
761,"Yes this relationship is unhealthy, so far I agree 100% with the consensus here. Even ignoring the temper problem, verbal abuse (which often turns into physical abuse), and the manipulation/control issues  all his behavior points to one clear fact. You do not matter, he and his happiness are all that he cares about. If you leave, which you should strongly consider, I would bet he will fight hard to keep you aka his hapiness (provided you are obeying). That's my take and advice."
762,"Your brothers are being mean as hell and there's nothing that really sets young jerky folks in line better than an ass kicking from Mom.

766,"I don't understand why any of you entertained this skeevy guy! Even before he set eyes on your sister he sounds gross. 

This is all a big game to him and your sister is legal and immature enough to fall for it and there's nothing you can do about it. I would however encourage your brother in law to cut off this friendship. This guy is enjoying being puppet master and doesn't card the fall out he is creating. Which your family could blame BIL for introducing this sleaze to your family to begin with. 

She not only sounds immature but religious with a rosey outlook, aka fictional view of life because she lacks experience even a lot of 18 year olds today do. You need to tread carefully because if you push to much she will react like a sullen child and cut you out because ""they are in love"", uck. 

"
767,"You were definitely in the wrong. Though you try to defend yourself using technicalities like ""they weren't dating,"" or ""why does she have dibs?"" you forget the moral clause.

As a sister (you) who has a sister (blood relative) who is also one of your best friends, there is an unspoken yet, legitimate rule that you cannot hurt this person. Maybe you haven't been in the same situation as her so there's a lack of understanding, but one can't just throw their feelings away. There was definitely a line that was crossed and betrayal on your part as a sister and a friend. If she were a stranger, it really would be a different story, but that is not the case.

What you can do to fix it, stay away from the guy other than to tell him that you (both) made a mistake and fucked up royally. Otherwise, you can never talk to him again. As for your sister, I advise you to give her space after giving a very VERY sincere apology taking responsibility. It could take days, months, years... but when it's over, you should never talk about it again."
768,"&gt;Is this unreasonable?

I believe this is unreasonable, yes. I'm not the type of person to be chained to my phone, and if I want to go on a hike somewhere cell service is dice, or if I'm at work, or if I'm out with friends, I am not going to be checking my phone every five seconds to see whether somebody is texting me. I check out from digital life and go live real life.

You're not his mother. He doesn't have to tell you his every move over the course of the day. That's crazy.

He's only disappearing for hours at a time. You need to get over whatever insecurity is driving this and be okay with that. It's not like he doesn't resurface. He's just living his life untethered to a device."
769,"Men are actually more likely to get blown up in situations like this.  But that's because they usually don't experience the constant feeling of being vulnerable to most of the people around them.

So a woman sees a strange unexpected package and thinks that it could be a ruse to get her to open the door, it could be poison, it could be a bomb.  She leaves it alone until she feels safe getting/opening it.

A man sees a strange unexpected package and probably doesn't think much of it, because he's not used to constantly assessing the likelihood of danger.  He goes out to get it.  If it's a ruse to get the door open, he has a chance of fending off the intruders.  If it's poison or a bomb, he's likely to get hurt by it."
770,"Yep, this is something that needs to be made clear to him is not acceptable. It sounds like from OP's post she's made it pretty clear to him. If that's the case, the relationship is already over. "

773,That's a really good idea!! ❤  Then I don't have to say the words out loud.  That's the hard part.  It's like I am afraid to admit that I am a lesbian.  
774,"She sounds exhausting. A partner should lift you up, not drag you down. "
775,"Holy fuck honey, you need to leave him and stop letting him guilt trip you. You're not running away from YOUR problems--you're running away from HIS problems. HIS problems are not YOUR problems. He's a nasty piece of work, dump him already."
776,"This seriously needs to be higher up. Forming romantic interests is a perfectly normal part of being 11. She has done nothing to indicate that she is involved in anything unhealthy. However, if she grows up thinking that this is just the way men treat women - invading their privacy, telling them who they can and cannot talk to, controlling the way they present themselves, and shaming them for exploring their sexuality - then that could very easily change.  

He's her brother, not her dad, and his obsession with her pubescent crushes would frankly be crossing a line even for a father. As an older sibling, you have a level of influence that parents don't possess: your younger siblings look up to you and want your approval, and they model the behaviors you display. You can be a friend to your younger siblings while still offering guidance in a way your parents can't. They can come to talk to you about the things they are uncomfortable bringing up with mom and dad. That changes when you destroy the trust by snooping. They don't confide anymore when they know that you're going to punish them for it.  

Look, OP, I don't think your brothers intentions are bad. I get the way that he's been shaped by your home life. Your sister is at a complicated age, however, and she'd benefit much more from a brother than a pseudo father figure. She's transforming into an actual person with her own ideas of who she wants to be, and if I were your brother I'd think about how cool that is and celebrate the fact that their bond has the potential to grow even stronger in a new way. Maybe try to explain that to him?"

But I would never settle down/move in with someone who hadn't lived on his own/with roommates for awhile. I need to know he can take care of his own space, pay bills, etc, and that we can share space. It's a different environment when you live with your parents. 

Does he have any plans to move out? Can his mom afford for him to move out?

Also, before you ever move in with anyone, make sure you feel the same way about cleaning. I'm a functional adult and I definitely dont clean my bathroom more than every other week. "

785,"I'm more concerned with the fact that you're going on overseas trip with an alcoholic than his response to ruining a birthday dinner. He is an alcoholic spouting off abuse only because you questioned his beer intake. 

The reality here is that unless he is committed to stopping his drinking problem through the help of therapy  and treatment then you are destined to repeat the situation over and over.

Any conversation that occurs when he's been drinking 8 to 12 beers really isn't a true relationship conversation anyway. It's fake when he's drunk.  Drunk people are notorious manipulators. It's impossible to reconstruct/work-through a conversation that you had with a drunk person, because it's not based in reality. 

You are upset because you are married to an active alcoholic, not because of the mean things said while drunk again. "
786,"Lol no. I know a few girls who make bank modelling freelance on Instagram and Tumblr and making YouTube videos. Instagram is a platform like any other and being pretty is a job like any other.

Bad mental wellness? Lol. What about a fast food job? Is that great for wellness?
 
This is a great opportunity for her and my advice would be to take it and develop a career/business. 

She gets to work on her own terms, flexible schedule, relatively low effort.

She needs a manager/agent to deal with her dms and emails.


BTW my friend made 5k for one Instagram post for example, how is that not of value??? 
Plus models with a lot of followers get favored over models with no social media."
787,"&gt;  Does she take me for a fool?

No. She's using drugs and will do whatever it takes to carry on using drugs. Source: used drugs.

&gt; but she said she would NEVER use her body in that way.

So did I... while I was using my body that way to pay for the drugs.

&gt;  She works full time and still cant afford this habit. I am recently out of work, and totalled my car, so she helps me a lot with my habit too.

DUDE. She works full time - you don't work, or have a car, and you both are shooting up multiple times a day. You admit she's 'helping' you with your habit - which means she's paying for it... I'm having a hard time with your aggression towards her basically doing everything, including buying your drugs.

You both need to get the hell away from each other, ASAP."

790,That is NOT being a bigot.  People part of the trans community face this at times and will not get offended when this happens once.

792,"People can't just join the seminary, there is a lengthy discernment process. He'd first of all need to be absolutely sure that this is his calling, as he's pledging himself to a lifetime of celibacy and service if he becomes a priest. The vocation has to be his, not something your sister thinks would be good for him. Your brother might well be called to marriage and fatherhood, but he won't know if he hasn't had a chance to really think about it and listen to what God's telling him.

I can't comment on your bishop's remarks (I don't understand what he means), but the first port of call is your parish priest, who can tell you how to contact the vocations director.  David has to be the instigator of this, it's his life, his (possible) vocation and his faith that we're talking about here.

Good luck!"
793,"More detail is needed here:

- **Why** do you only see each other once a month on average? I get that during the weeks can be hard because of work schedules, but what do you guys do on weekends? Are you just not seeing each other? Is he not prioritizing you over friends/hobbies/etc? I work two jobs one FT one PT, one of which is an hour commute each way, and still have more than enough time to manage a relationship.

- If he's working so much and living at home why on earth is he not financially able to move out? Where does his money go?

- You skirted around the ""we both live with our parents for reasons"" thing, and something tells me there's more here you're not saying: are one or both of you living with really controlling/religious parents? Why are you both living at home if you're working?

- Why not get a place together? It's been ~~two~~ almost three years and everything else is supposedly great?

- What has happened in the past when you've tried to make a schedule/date plans more regularly? Does he flake? Refuse? Have you even tried?

EDIT: years dated almost three, not two."

800,"Let's talk about the benefit of the doubt.  Neither of you are extending it to each other.  I'm going to focus on you here mostly - not because you are solely to blame, but because you're the one asking for advice and you're the one reading this.  

Let's look at the things that she's said/done that have pissed you off:  

&gt;""It's important she eats, Yell at her, guilt her, whatever you have to do to make her eat"". 

Come on. You know what she meant. You zoned in on ""yell"" because you're in a bad place emotionally right now.  And when you snapped back, your wife should have given you some grace, realizing you're sensitive.  She should have known why you reacted that way.  But I think you know you may have overreacted a tad.

&gt;I just said, you're the one I trust, go to for support and can open up to. I guess that's why somethings you see me more upset and it seems like I take it out on you"". Inside I was pretty hurt that somehow this came to be focused on her. 

Come on, man. She's sharing her feelings. She's telling you, please watch how you talk to me because I feel like you're treating me poorly.  Your response was a bit defensive and also weak.  You could have apologized and said you'll do your best but that you're in a bad place right now.  You could have shared your feelings.  And you're right: it shouldn't be all about her.  But it shouldn't be all about you either, right? Even if you're doing the heavy lifting, her life is affected too, especially if you've been in this mood for a while now.

&gt;""So when was the last time your brother helped your mom?"". I was pretty bothered by this as it made me feel like she was upset I went to help mom, it seemed like she wanted to get me upset about my brother.

Maybe. Or maybe she was trying to make conversation.  Perhaps you do feel upset with your brother for not doing more and letting that upset spill over on your wife.  Perhaps you'd feel better if you shared your feelings about that?  Or perhaps you should just have straight-up said that you don't want to talk about it. But give her the benefit of doubt, man. You're starting to expect her to walk on eggshells when making small talk.

Now on to the sleep thing, both the covers-stealing and her walking in to do her exercises.  No doubt, it was insensitive of your wife to turn on the music while you were trying to sleep after she knew you had a rough night.  But why didn't you go to the spare bedroom when you couldn't sleep because she was stealing your blankets?  And does she generally do exercises in the bedroom in the morning?  In other words, did you anticipate that she would walk in, turn on the music, and exercise, but instead of asking her not to disturb you, just assumed she'd be supportive and give it up that day?

&gt;When she asked me I said the inside ones and she got upset and starting telling me why I can't do that (I know, I don't need a lecture). 

It would have been excellent of your wife to just give you that benefit of doubt and let it go because obviously your mind is someplace else.  That being said, no one needs a lecture when they mess up, but unless she's completely harping on you, surely you don't expect her to let go of everything you do wrong - inadvertently or on purpose - simply because you didn't mean to mess up or are hurting right now.  

&gt;She never asked why i was upset.

Dude.  She knows why you're upset.  And you know why you're upset too, and it's not because she stole your covers, asked about your brother, mentioned yelling, etc.  You're upset because your mom is sick and you're feeling understandably miserable about it.  And she was busy telling you why she's upset, which is not a time when you ask someone else why they're upset.  Think about it: during that talk, did you ask her why she was upset.  Probably not, after all, she didn't need the prompting to share her feelings.  You should do the same!

&gt;In the end instead of getting helped with how I'm feeling I am now having to put in extra energy I don't have to try and make things right with my wife.

And this goes to the heart of the dilemma: what sort of support were you looking for from your wife? Aside from her allowing you to take your feelings out on her, I'm not really seeing you asking her for anything and her refusing.  I know you're hurting, OP, but if you hurt someone's feelings, you need to make things right.  Just because you're hurting doesn't mean you can say or do stuff without considering the consequences.  You can still hurt other people's feelings and you when you do you still need to recognize it and apologize. 


It seems like, perhaps subconsciously, you want to be upset at your wife, and your wife wants to be upset at you.  Even though you are hurting, you need to give your wife the benefit of doubt and watch how you talk to her.  And she needs to be more supportive of you.  The best way for you to achieve that - her being more supportive - is to share your feelings in a non-accusing way.

TL;dr: Look, dude, it's a paradox. When someone hurts us, we get angry and want them to apologize and make it up to us.  To get that they are in the wrong, to be there to show how much they care. When we hurt someone, we want understanding - for them to give us the benefit of doubt without needing to apologize.  To get that we didn't mean it, that we wouldn't do that, etc.  Give more of that support to your wife and ask her to share it back.

801,"Dude.  That's so beyond ridiculous.  Stop it.  Honestly, I work in a pretty laid-back office, and I could see an incident like that being grounds for disciplinary action at least.

Even if you're Amanda's manager, that request is out of line.  If you're merely her coworker, it's even worse.  You shouldn't be giving direction to equal coworkers unless it's on a subject that you specialize in or a project you are running, you know?  I mean, you can definitely give advice or even gentle coaching if she does something you know is against the office culture, because that's just kind behavior, but to direct her to do something like this is not okay."

820,"I lost my dad when I was 11 years old. I miss him everyday. A lot of the words and advice I'm about to give you are what helped me the most. I hope they can help you too. I'm so sorry for you loss.

When you lose someone, especially a parent, I think a part of you dies with them. You slowly learn how to deal without this part of you but it takes time/tears to get there. As hard as it is, my advice is to let the sadness in as much as you can without falling apart. I distinctly remember going to a restaurant with my mom 1 year after I lost him and being sat at a table where he had comforted me about a failed test and I just broke down into tears and after I explained to her the significance so did my mom. Let it happen. Cry as long as you need to. Remember him and eventually one day you'll wake up and the hole won't feel as big. The memories that brought you to tears will soon cause you to smile. You will get through this. I promise :)

Next, you need to explain to your mom that you cannot afford to help her. As long as she has all of her faculties I think it should be easy for her to find a minimum wage job. I think there are government programs that exist to help the elderly find employment (Maybe not anymore if you are in the US).  Please remember that she made her bed a long time ago by not saving for retirement or having life insurance in place. You are not responsible for your mom (financially or otherwise) and to have that expectation from her as well as your family is absurd. I know this is an already difficult time but I think the best thing to do is for you to make a statement to your family saying you cannot financially support your mother and go low contact until you are emotionally ready. 

Hang in there OP! You can do this. You can get through this.  "

If your partner really wants to be with you, he'd be happy to live in a more modest house, the kind you've described you'd like to buy outright. I understand that he wants a house in an expensive area, near his kids, presumably with extra bedrooms for them to use when they're with him. However, that's his ideal lifestyle, not yours. He's not even free to marry you.

He wants something he can't afford, and he can't believe you're not going to cave in and make it happen for him. This is probably unknown territory for him, hence his reaction. Please keep your inheritance safe, see how things go with your relationship and commit to nothing right now. 

I'm very sorry for your loss, my parents were also kind, loving and giving people. They died within a couple of years of each other, and it took me a long time to feel normal afterwards.

There's no compromise here; he's obviously not interested in you or your feelings enough to try.

She's having her cake and eating it too. Time for you to put an end to the situation at present.

908,"&gt;Is it just me overreacting to something that happened in the past?

This is not even remotely in the past. It's still ongoing. They were planning on rewatching their tape in the *future*. He wasn't betraying your private life in the past either. 

And what's more disturbing he was including you in his sex life with her without your consent. You were just an accessory being used to spice up their sex life. I hope you haven't exchanged any pictures or videos with him because he's probably supplying her and her husband with those as well.

He doesn't respect you as proven by his actions or your intelligence with the dumbest excuses he's provide. I know you're shaken up but take your time and really think about this. This guy should not be trusted. "
909,Exactly this. CPS doesn't take kids out of the home unless they have to. But they do have access to services that can be extended to the mother for free that she otherwise wouldn't be able to get/might not be able to afford. 
910,"Thank you. Betrayed doesn't quite fit here. Wasn't dishonest of her. Not sure how to really feel yet other than hurt/confused what to do next. I don't fault her though, she's lost too... Whatever she's going through is hard to relate to, and must be lonely. Hopefully she'll find peace soon, but my gut tells me this'll end without us staying together. 

To answer your question: Nah, I'm not worried about no one else loving or accepting me. What I meant, without going into too much personal detail, is the life we built came at the expense of one that took years of hardship, and now it looks like I'll be returning to square one. Again, I won't share specifics, but quality of life is about to be really shitty regardless of heartache. "
911,"The reply to the OP about labeling substance abuse as just ""partying hard"" looks pretty spot on to me in light of this.

Your other comment mentioning how other people do harder drugs but you don't like to keep them around also implies two problems to me: 1. the people doing harder drugs are around at least some of the time (nothing you said even makes it clear you try to keep them away; it sounds to me more like they're present because they know they can get away with it and it wouldn't ""be cool"" to kick them out for harder drugs, so you ""don't like it"" but also don't do anything about it. Feel free to correct me.) and 2. you are doing everything up to those hard drugs yourself, which is definitely... ""severe"" partying.

I think a lot of the other comments have pretty much nailed that she's doing the best thing for both of you and this is more than an insignificant incompatibility. If she was looking to settle down, your lifestyle (which I do again believe is essentially denial of substance abuse if we are being honest) is just not a stable lifestyle to settle down with. There isn't really a happy ending to be had there without one of you doing a 180, and it looks to me like you are the one who will one day be better off for having tried to. 

Not that your lifestyle is outright wrong or bad - and it does sound like you were pretty good partner too - but there are not going to be many responsible, mature adults who think you have the makings of a good long term serious partner, which is what someone looking to ""settle down"" wants."
912,5k? $400 a month? That doesn't even pay for a crappy room in a crappy house before food or books or anything else. That's crazy on the other side of the scale...
913,"She lived there too, but you didn't ever ask if it was OK for people to come over. It sounds like she was never treated like an equal inhabitant of your house. Pile that on to things to avoid with your future relationships. 

This was the first year of your relationship, during the honeymoon stage where you both are trying your hardest (with less effort because hormones). Despite that, your bedroom life died down and she was sad and distant for months. These are things you should have noticed, why didn't you think they were more important? "
914,"Woah, hang on. You are projecting your history onto a totally different situation.

&gt;
watching things that were very specific like Asian girls, etc. things that I'm not and will never be. 

Not OPs problem.

&gt;To make things worse he was watching porn while I was at work and then not having sex with me.

Very not OPs problem, and not something anyone would defend.

&gt;I think your boyfriend has an addiction. I think you deserve to be with a man who will fantasize about you and get off to you. 

This is irresponsible. Don't diagnose people with addictions based on this limited information.

&gt;
&gt;All the people that are saying it's no big deal and act like porn is so normal and fine, 

You can disagree with that, but please don't make things up and project on others. Most people can watch porn without addictions or lying. I'm sorry you had a bad experience.

915,"He's the one who chose to mistreat you. This is not your doing. You didn't know who he really was until it was difficult and scary to untangle your life from his. That was intentional on his part, I guarantee. 

If you're not willing to go into the gory details yet, just tell your parents:

""Listen, there were a lot of very deep, very serious problems in our relationship, and particularly with the way he treated me behind closed doors. I'm not ready to talk about it yet, but I need you to trust me and back me up, because I am hurting right now and I need to know you still love and support me."" "
916,"1. It took both of them. You don't have to forgive your brother just because he is family. It's pretty shitty what he did, BUT if you feel you rather still have a relationship that is your choice. 
2. No matter how you react to this you're not crazy. Unless you begin murdering and what not. 
3. Don't blame one more than the other. It's equal. They became sneaky and got caught. There's no point in saying well _________ initiated it. They both did their fair share. 
4. I would assume there is a trust issue now and the foundation of a relationship is trust so I would suggest breaking up with her. 
5. Your first love or not, she cheated on you --- She can do it again. I believe in second chances, BUT some things you just cannot live on with knowing. 
6. Your decision on how to handle all of this is up to you but EVERYONE deserves better than being with someone who is a cheater. 

hope this helps xxxx "

923,People here like to nitpick.
924,"This is a great analogy, honestly. /u/AwkwardOddball I'm diabetic, if I don't take my insulin I feel like crap, and continue to feel crappier until I end up in the hospital or dead. Do I want to be on insulin for the rest of my life, not really no, needles suck and insulin is expensive but guess who's stuck on insulin (it's me). I've been on insulin for 11 years, and will be until I'm dead. Sometimes life happens and we have to do/take things we really don't want, things that the vast majority of people don't have to but by the grace of god you weren't/aren't that lucky.

Same with antidepressants, you have a medical issue, antidepressants and therapy are your treatment. Take your meds (unless your doctor says not too)."
925,Target them how. Make fun of them because their grandmother was abused? Do you live among monsters?
926,That's why a nice (able to record crisply in the dark) camera is needed.
927,"You do not need to consider another family member's timeline... At least, not much.  Yes, it would be rude to schedule your wedding the weekend before your brother's.  It wouldn't be rude to schedule your wedding a month or two before or after your brother's wedding.

Your bigger problem is that your BF doesn't want to commit to being married to you.  At 33 years old and after having been with you for 8 years, he should know whether or not he wants to marry you.  The fact that he continues to delay any real discussion of marriage is a sign that he doesn't want to get married.  I don't know why he can't come out a tell you but he doesn't want to get married.

Is marriage important to you?  Is it important enough to break up over?

I think you've got a couple choices:  You could propose to him.  Ask him to marry you and PAY ATTENTION TO HIS REACTION.  If he equivocates in any way, the answer is ""No, he doesn't want to marry you"".  If that's the case, do you want to stay with him or go your own way? 

Your other option to consider would be to consider whether or not marriage is as important as you thought it was and possibly drop the idea of getting married.  From a legal/civil standpoint, marriage is the joining of two people for the purpose of owning assets, building wealth, and raising children.  Strictly speaking, you don't really need to be married to do any of those things.  Being married won't change your feelings for each other at all.  So, how important is it that you get married?

Another, possibly deeper issue to consider... If he can't commit to being married as you've always planned, what other future plans have the two of you discussed that he isn't really able to go through with?  The traditional path is to get married and then have kids.  If he isn't able to go through with marrying you, does he really want kids with you?  Or does he ""not make enough money"" for that as well?

I could be wrong, but I suspect your BF hasn't proposed because he is perfectly happy with how things are now.  If he does consider marriage, he think of it as something far in the future.  If you want marriage and kids, it's time to tell BF to put up or shut up. "

931,"You're young, so it's understandable that you don't realize just how awfully this is being handled.

You do not want to work at a shitshow like this. Seriously - you're better off making minimum wage at McDonald's.

&gt;At the same time it's my first job, and I can't help but feel that to throw away a position like this would be an asshole move on my part, let alone a damning bit of evidence against me in future employment scenarios.

There's no official record of all the jobs you've worked. Don't put it on your resume and no one will ever know."

933,"This was my ex husband. When we decided to fix the relationship after years of hatefulness, I specifically told him the things he said were very hurtful and made me hate him and if could stop saying awful things that I would forgive, forget and make it work. He just continued and I left him. Example, my bio dad, who I was not raised with,
 is schizophrenic. Anytime we would get into a heated argument he would tell me I'm crazy like my dad. Mind you, I have never been diagnosed with a mental issue. He just didn't like that he couldn't walk all over me without me standing up for myself. And that's just one example among many. No faster way to destroy a relationship than to use trusted information against your loved one. "
934,"&gt;You just leave anyway. 

What was she supposed to do, cancel a months-long trip to appease a temper tantrum? If the problem was long distance, then that's legitimate and he should have put forth his boundaries beforehand. But it's not clear that that's the issue."
