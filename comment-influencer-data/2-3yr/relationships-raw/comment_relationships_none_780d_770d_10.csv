0,"&gt; it gives me this powerless feeling that if I want to have sex with my boyfriend I have to wait until he decides to.

Nobody can force someone to have sex. So yes, the person in the relationship with the lower libido is likely going to be making the decision more often. 

Unfortunately, there's a stigma that the guy should always want it.


It doesn't sound like you are clearly communicating what you want. Just making him feel bad for not wanting sex all the time. My partner and I are perfectly healthy, and in our early 30s, and perfectly happy having sex 3-4x per month. 

You say there's no foreplay, but have you ever spoken about what you particularly enjoy in the bedroom? Not just frequency. Have you ever asked him what he enjoys in the bedroom and what would make him happy physically?


Neither of you know how to communicate. You push each other, slam glasses, being immature, etc. You both need anger management. 

He is almost 2x your age, you aren't sexuality compatible, you don't know how to communicate with each other, you don't seem to like each other, why are you in this relationship?"
1,"It sounds to me like you already have a child. 
Who needs to be spoiled, entertained, doted on, and cared for every second of your day. 

Doesn't seem fun, eh? 
Divorce, please. You can't expect anything good to come out of a relationship where one wants a life changing crotch spawn and the other doesn't. 

If my boyfriend told me tomorrow that he couldn't accept my decision to be child free, we would be over. Simple as that. A child is a lifelong commitment. And it's not something to do just to please someone else. 

Spend your hard earned money on your toys and go find someone who is like minded. Believe it or not, a good number of women are beginning to realize they don't have to breed. You'll find one.

2,"What's the difference between urgent care and an emergency room? Is it like a walk in clinic? We don't have urgent care where I'm from, we don't even have enough doctors for our hospitals let alone another form of emerg"
3,"&gt; My partner is the higher earner and better saver. He paid the entire downpayment for our first house but we split the mortgage equally, and we owned the house jointly. We had it written up that if we were to split, the house would be sold and the profit would be split equally AFTER my partner receives his original investment back. 

My husband and I have a similar agreement. My parents gifted me a large sum to buy my first home. I bought at the right time and built up some significant equity on top of their gift. I sold the house and bought a new house with my husband. I used part of the proceeds from the sale to pay off his student loan, and line of credit, and put the rest towards a hefty down payment on our current place.

We have an agreement that states: if we split and sell the house I get back every penny of my initial investment (including what I paid on his debt) and then we split the remaining amount 50/50. 

Currently, my husband isn't on the mortgage or the house title. When we bought the house he was unemployed and because of his debt it would have negatively effected our interest rate. Despite that legality, it is OUR house. He has as much say in it as I do. The decision to keep him of the mortgage was purely a financial one as our rate would have gone form 2.19% to 3.12%. We both agreed it was a dumb financial move to put him on the title. But we worked behind the scenes to ensure he views it as his home and that he's legally protected should anything happen to me. 

"
4,"I really hate it when people don't put responsibility on the shoulders of the correct person. Debbie didn't fuck up your marriage, your wife did. Debbie didn't force her at gunpoint to fuck another guy, your wife did that on her own. Poor wife was young and easily influenced. Bullshit. She was an adult. She decided to not only break her vows of fidelity, but she purposefully hid it from you for years. You don't trust your wife because she is untrustworthy. Period. 

This friend will never bring you peace of mind because your wife already tore it to shreds. This friend cannot piece it back together for you. It is not her fault. This all lies squarely on your wife's shoulders. You are trying to place the burden on the friend because you refuse to face the fact that your wife hurt you consciously of her own free will.

Do you need permission to be pissed as hell with your wife? To find her untrustworthy? I give you permission to to doubt her every word and action. This will not make you a bad husband. It makes you human.

Go back to counseling. Your resentment is festering.  The affair may be long over for your wife, but it's brand new to you since she's been lying about it for years. Treat it as if it happened yesterday. The healing process must start from scratch.

*ETA:

&gt;This was the first time I had heard this. She was genuinely shocked and thought that she had told me this back in 2014.

You're wife was not shocked, genuinely or otherwise; she's just a fantastic actress. It comes with the territory of being a lying liar who lies, I'm afraid. The mental gymnastics you are doing in order to give you wife the benefit of the doubt, while understandable, are hindering your ability to process your pain."
5,Your boyfriend's behaviour is disgusting
6,"I have a big extended family of ""aunts"" and ""uncles"" who aren't technically blood but they have been there like my mom's siblings since forever. I even talk to some of them outside my mom and we hang out sometimes, they used to babysit when I was little. I don't have grandparents or cousins or anything like that. "
7,Came down here to say this. It's a slight to others living with illness if THAT's the excuse he has for cheating. Also really? he was a 18 year old who went for a 15 year old? That's just creepy.
8,Hahah this killed me.  It's got cooties!
9,"OP, at 14 you are not an adult and you are not his parent. You should not be obliged to supervise your brother for long periods of time, particularly if he is out of control and is harming you. It sounds like he has some behavioral issues that will require adult help to sort out. It is NOT your responsibility to solve it. It is your parents'. 

If you have to watch him, then locking your door and locking him out leaves him without supervision, correct? That is also not OK. Your parents need to get better supervision for both of you in the home and they need to do it ASAP. 

If your brother hits you, DO NOT HIT HIM BACK UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. Shame on the adults who are giving you that advice. But do remove yourself from the situation immediately and/or restrain him (safely). Do not allow him to hurt you. 

Talk to his grandmother and your aunt as soon as possible if your parents will not listen to you. Tell them that his behavior is not your responsibility and that you will NOT take care of him when there is not an adult around. 

If your extended family cannot help you, then google ""Child Protective Services"" for your area and call them the next time you are left alone with him and he is out of control. Explain the situation and that you feel unable to supervise him safely. 

If your parents will not listen to you, they will have to listen to the social worker sent out by CPS. It won't be easy or fun to get them involved, but it sounds like your little brother needs an adult to help get him on the right track with his behavior and YOU ARE NOT THE ADULT. You are a teenager and this is NOT your responsibility (or your fault). "
10,"That, and the insurance company has a vested interest in going after the liable party. Even if the authorities don't get involved, the dog owner could see a claim on their homeowners liability policy. (I'm assuming this is the U.S. but insurance laws differ state to state). "

12,"&gt; what if it's a child the next time?

I'm a huge dog lover despite having had a good portion of my face mangled by a dog when I was 5 years old which required reconstructive surgery. But having been in that position, I do think you should do as much as you can to make sure some kind of steps are taken to ensure this doesn't happen again. It's not a fun experience. "
13,"Losing some baby stuff isn't the worst thing in the world. It happens. But I just Googled 'Melbourne Central baby store' and three in-complex results came up immediately. Why didn't you go and buy another blanket or some clothes? Or even a non-baby blanket? Why didn't you check lost and found at the mall if you didn't want to buy anything? Why didn't you give the baby your jacket? Why did you think it was a good idea to WALK 10 minutes and interrupt your wife's work day to get her to bring you a blanket than DRIVE in a warm car 20 minutes back home? Why didn't you respond to your baby whimpering from the cold? Have you got literally no sense or initiative? I'm a childless woman in my early 20s on the other side of the planet and I figured this shit out. 

You say you've fucked up with the baby before - I'm not surprised your wife is kicking you out. If you are regularly this useless and irresponsible caring for an infant then you are not a safe person for the baby to be around. "
14,On that note OP doesn't even have to meet the lady face to face to give her the medical bills. Just mail it to her or have OP's mom personally deliver the bills to the owner. 
15,"I don't know why everyone here so far keeps saying ""no offense, but maybe..""  Fuck that.  

YOU are an ungrateful ass.  He has listened to your input all this time, did the work for you so you can relax, plan specifics other than the itinerary, and have your perfect EPIC getaway.  And you throw it back in his face immediately?  

What he did is amazing!  You need to wake the fuck up, go to him and, frankly, beg for his forgiveness.  You'll be lucky if he hasn't canceled it all already.  

Personally, if I were him, I'd have already exchanged your ticket for one for another woman... one that will be grateful for this amazing gift."
16,She already left on vacation (said op in the previous post)
17,"2 months later you're thinking about this? Unless there has been a lot of other red flags you're not telling us about then the problem isn't your boyfriend. 

You say you've worked on your trust issues- have you got therapy? If not, I would consider it. 

If you are actively looking for reasons to distrust your partner you will ALWAYS find one. You need to figure this out or it will ruin every relationship you have. 

Honestly, I think this relationship is over. Not because he cheated, but because if you're still obsessing about this months later, then you're probably never going to actually trust him. "
18,"Your mom created a really screwed up situation.

A 28 year old needs to start their own life and live on their own. So do you. Asking your child to pay for your home because of your own financial troubles isn't being a good parent. You are both way too old to be in a situation where you are depending on while supporting your mother like this. 

Letting your kids save money by living with you is normal. Asking them to then pay for your home isn't. Your mom could have been demanding rent from both of you all this time if she thought that was the right thing.

I don't blame your sister for getting out on her own. If she put her life savings down into your moms home, she is just that much further away from ever moving out on her own and has to depend on your mom for longer. 

She could have been more open with her intentions all along, but she might have just seen an opportunity now and realized she was making a mistake. 

You should look to get out, too, OP. "
19,"Of course you can't trust him again, he's having an affair and you caught him (heck you caught him before but he pulled the wool over your eyes). Dump him.

&gt; But I don't want to leave him to deal with his illness alone.

He's got family. He's got friends. He's got his other girlfriend. H ewon't be alone."
20,"He refers to his mother and other people as peasants? Is he Scott Disick??

In all seriousness, he has already hurt you. Don't give him another chance. We already know he's physically abusive, and with that description you just wrote, it sounds like he's already emotionally destroyed a few people..."
21,"yeah - I guess you're right. He is tall and gorgeous, so I wonder if a lot of women just go along with his behavior? Like he is oblivious bc it's worked for him in the past? "
22,"Nah I'm just not a good looking guy. 

For an example of what I look like, people have said I look like the footballer Wayne Rooney or like a young John C Reilly. "
23,"Absolutely, dude. All kinds of women have stopped feeling attracted to me ;)"
24,thanks - looks like I do have my answer...
25,"I hold hands and cuddle with my little sister and my younger cousins, and kissing someone's cheek is the norm in our country. None of this sounds weird to me. "
26,"Yeah I don't know why this isn't at the top. Something similar happened to my mother when she had my sister (they tried to force her into a new contract and position), and she was even well liked! Totally illegal and there was a lawsuit, honestly I would delete this post. "
27,"Including the hand holding, the cuddling, and the kissing? "
28,"This is really, really, really, the best advice and should be further up.

Also, I wanted to point out that in your post you mentioned a couple times that it seemed this only happened because of drugs.  And that may be true, there's a lot of people who act a certain way on drugs that would never do that if they were in their right mind.

HOWEVER, one month clean does not a reformed man make - especially if he's only clean because the cops are sniffing around since you filed that report.  Even if you did want to pursue something with him because you loved him, the best course of action would be to let him be clean for a year or two at least."
29,"Cleaning lady is fine for the deep cleaning, but the day to day stuff like dishes, sweeping the floor, counters, laundry and decluttering is another matter.  I am not a clean freak, but I would say it took me a few hours a day to keep up with the house when I have kids (kids are living entropy) and now that my kids are older, it is about 20-30 minutes in the morning and another 20-30 minutes in the afternoon.  "
30,"Your title is misleading. Peeked? Sounds like you regularly read her diary if you're finding ""good stuff"" 

Break up. You no longer trust her and she shouldn't trust you since you keep invading her privacy. "
31,"That's actually the best thing you can do, love yourself!!"
32,I think you should assume it's over.
33,"Exactly what I was going to suggest. FYI - You are not technically using a fake name, just a name that avoids privacy issues and one that can be in one way or another attributed to you (in this case by birth).

You may even suggest that they continue calling you by your birth name, and that for legal reasons only, you need to be listed as ""Mary""."
34,"Well yeah, but reading their texts? That's only justified if the child is in danger. Maybe if you've caught them doing cocain or something."
35,"If you already have your anniversary date planned and didn't make explicit plans, I don't see what's so wrong about him inviting his parents to dinner. (Unless you have an issue with his parents?) it kind of seems like pure expecting him to read your mind about things instead of being straightforward - ""I want to spend Sunday and Monday with you"", instead of ""I want more romance"", because that second one is met by the anniversary plans already in place. "
36,"Well, you can assume whatever you want, but that's not in line with what the OP says.  They intentionally gave her a role that was not ""in her wheelhouse"" in order to create a situation where she would fail and then quit.  Simply not making things easy would imply that didn't have intent, whereas OP seems to think they did.  Although why in the world they would have ever told OP about this intentional plan is something I really don't understand.  "
37,"I love that this is his only comment. He has about 4-5 hours of free time in the evening but he thinks he needs to quit his job because he doesn't have enough time to pickup after himself or spend 20-30 minutes helping out.

I wonder if his wife gets 4-5 hours a day to just wind down and enjoy care-free time playing with their son. It struck me that he didn't say he spent time at night taking care of the kid just that he plays with him. He could do the bedtime routine or bath or straighten up the kids toys as they play but no. That's too much. 

Does he ever cook dinner? Clean up after dinner? How do weekends go? Does he do an equal share of childcare? Is it even harder for his wife to have him home on weekends because he never picks up after himself so she's stuck cleaning up after three people instead of two?




"
38,"So your ""girlfriend"" went on a couple's trip with her ""ex"" and another couple.

I am speechless. 

You need to end this ""relationship"" and learn how to respect yourself. "
39,"It's called student loans, and she can apply for them like every other adult who goes to school. You don't owe her anything, she ultimately knew when she decided to go to this program that breaking up and paying her own way was a possibility. Aaaaaannnddd then she cheated on you. So not your problem anymore IMO. Save your money and invest in your own future. "
40,"&gt; I am flattered by your interest

Absolutely do not say that. 

This creep found her phone number somehow and is following her around. Anything suggesting flattery is going to be met with further enthusiasm."
41,"I think you should just text the parent to have more information about the baby and how to act around him, and slowly build a relationship with the baby."
42,"+ he also control what OP can talk about with her family and friend.

OP you wil find better, he played in your brain to put a fear that you might not. This fear will dissolve as time psas by."
43,But why does he want to be close to such a nasty dude?
44,"What you said wasn't mildly offensive. You shouldn't have to apologize for this. 

If Shaun's bf wants this much of a safe space then he shouldn't leave the house. The overly-ridiculous PC police really give some groups a bad name and cause regression for tolerance. Jokes will always be jokes and if someone can't understand that then it is their job to suffer through life with a poor sense of humor, not your job to cater to their oversensitive needs. "

48,"I'm sorry, why are you having this disccussion with your boyfriend AT ALL? Either he cuts off the friend entirely for assaulting you, or you dump him. Don't let him do this do you, OP. Your problem isn't the friend making trouble in your relationship, but rather your boyfriend not having your back. If he won't take your side against someone who did something so horrible to you, he's not a keeper."
49,"&gt;And now they keep calling me asking what's going on, why I'm upset with them. It's like they have no memory of what happened

Tell them. Keep your party line strong and consistent, do not deviate from this. Let them know that you and your sister have tolerated rudeness and disrespect from Rachel for years, but put up with it for the sake of the family. But you will not tolerate racism and physical violence from her, and you are disgusted that your parents will take the side of the racist and the attacker in this case over the victim. Their stance in this matter means they are no longer welcome. No discussion."
50,"I love what a great boyfriend you are, and I cannot BELIEVE this awful Rachel is 30!! Dear god.  I would stick to your guns, and be as dignified about it as your lovely Neha has been.  And if you were thinking of proposing....do it now, and your family might see a little more of Rachel's dark side.  Best of luck to both of you."
51,[deleted]
52,You should give her the option- hiding this from her really isn't fair. 
53,"I call shenanigans. As someone who was married to a perpetually fired person who always found a way to describe it as not solely his fault (despite the fact that he insulted coworkers or supervisors within a week all the time), this reeks of the same thing.


He singles out a child in class and that's somehow not solely his fault?


She's pregnant and not being communicated with and rightfully panicking - sorry, he bears the onus of making communication, and living, bearable for *her* right now "
54,"If he had, more than likely, sent the photo earlier in the day then why did the alert happen when you had arrived later? Photos usually send right away so I'm just a bit confused here from your story. "
55,Were you only with her because she had breasts or for other reasons? 
56,"First off, very nice formatting! 

I think it's important to let him know when you're going to break up. This information may change things, but it's better than him being blindsided and you having guilt for not telling him.

If he decides to ride it out, just enjoy each other like you normally would. Eat at your favorite place and do your favorite things. Make good memories together and just let the time go by. 

You're not breaking up out of spite but out of mutual respect for each other's feelings. A lot of people on this sub aren't so lucky. Take comfort in that."
57,"What the actual hell. That is ridiculous for two people. I lived in San Diego and spent $100/month for just myself. When I lived in Hamilton ON it was about the same. I now live in the slightly cheaper South Carolina and husband and I spend $160-$200/month on groceries. Please, check out r/eatcheapandhealthy

If you buy processed, frozen food, this will easy eat up your money. We only buy fresh produce and veggies and meat, with the occasional frozen dinners."
58,"Honestly op, finding a place with someone you've never lived with, actually scratch that, someone you've never even kissed, is a really fucking stupid idea. You know what makes it more stupid? The fact that she has 2 young children and you're still contemplating it. 

There are support networks for abused, single mothers. Find them and direct her to these resources. Do not try and be her knight in shining armour, it will not work out well for you. 

Once she graduated? So she is guaranteed to have a job within a month of graduating? 

How do you go about making this work? You let the people who are trained to deal with these types of things do it. You don't move into a new apartment with someone you haven't even kissed. You also don't lie to your parents, one of whom is responsible for your paycheck "
59,"Hey so did my sister. She had her son with a piece of shit loser that tried to beat her and told me at the age  of 15 that he had incessant thoughts of killing himself. He's a piece of shit objectively.  
  
Granted my sister has come a LONG way since then and I'm extremely proud of the maturation she has made into an amazing mother, but it wasn't always that way. It's very easy to if you have a child at the ripe age of way too young to stagnate in develop (example a this post) *Obviously* not everyone is like that, you I'm sure and my sister being prime examples, but I don't think either of you are outting dog shit in your children's beds now are you?  
  
Edit: also, how old are you if you don't mind my asking. It's great that your child's father is ""still in the picture"". But let's not act like that's the common occurrence in these situations. "
60,"Yeah, definitely not a friend. I've been in that situation, and it hurts, but like, if you're truly friends with two people, you'd want them to be happy, even if you're not part of that happiness.  

&gt;You know it's love when all you want is that person to be happy, even if you're not part of their happiness"
61,"My ex and I had separate duvets because I couldn't fall asleep when cuddling cause he was like a human-sized heater. He also fell asleep really fast and his arm weighed half a tonne if it was around me, resulting in it taking even longer for me. Come morning though and my duvet was cold and abandoned cause I'm apparently a cuddler once I've fallen asleep. I also sleep like I'm dead, whereas he was a light sleeper, so on nights he had to get proper-proper sleep we put a noodle-pillow between us to keep me at bay. When not drawn to his body-heat, I woke up in the same position I fell asleep in. It was a bit sad using a pillow for distance, but at the same time there's loads of awake-time in which to be a couple, and sleep is serious business."
62,"people cheat for a variety of reasons, arrogance, not knowing what they've got, self destructive urges, stupidity, the brain between his legs.  however he lied most likely, because he knew he was in the wrong and wanted to assuage his own guilt by appearing as the wounded party, and hoping that his then gf wouldn't find out, focus on the cancer scare, and then move back on with the relationship. Unfortunately, life doesn't work like that.

As for not sending her stuff back - this is pretty simple.  He sees this as a link to her, in a forlorn attempt to get her back.  He is hoping she will call, ask for it back, go round and see, him, talk, accept his apologies, get back together......

But in reality, one of you guys should call him.  tell him you/other friend and her are coming around on a set day to pick up the stuff.  go there, be polite and business-like, pick up the stuff and leave. (check it is all there too)  Don't accept a coffee, have a chat, sit down and talk about old times.  Make it transactional.

And as a parting word to him, get her to tell him that it is over, and you would appreciate him not ever contacting her again.  Tell him that to his face, with a witness present.  make it clear, and blunt. Then take her home, out for a drink, and get her back running on all cylinders.

63,Even after 2 years the spark of my relationship hasnt gone away. We love each other more than ever and i couldnt think of anyone id be happier with :)
64,"Yeah I've seen tons of gaming groups kick out the person complaining even though their complaints are 100% valid. ""What, this guy is harassing you, and has been for a while now? Really vile stuff? Yeah okay but...we think his jokes are really funny so we're not getting rid of him. You do what you want."""
65,Ok so the ending is kinda happy but there is some stuff buried here that should be making you uneasy. Your boyfriend says that he was upset at you doing something on your own because he was worried you'd leave him. This is a huge flag to be aware of.
66,"&gt;My girlfriend also finds it annoying that I wait to speak up

Not gonna lie, this would annoy the fuck out of me too. It's one thing if someone suggests a thing and I need a day or two to decide if I like it. I'll say, ""Let me decide by X."" It's another to say yes because you don't know how to or want to say no off the bat and let the person take your answer to mean yes.

I realize my point doesn't help a whole lot in the current situation, but maybe take it under advisement for future improvement?

As for right now, it sounds like you both had reasons to be pissed, neither of you handled it well, and either she's willing to come back from being very very pissed off at you or not. There isn't a whole lot you can do about it."
67,"&gt;  Honestly, this is something your parents should be doing but it seems they have checked out. So his ""training"" falls to you

No it doesn't. You are not responsible for parenting your younger brother. You are only 14 years old, and you are not equipped to be his mentor and guardian. You should feel no obligation to be this child's parent. This kid needs attention from an adult.

You are too young to be a baby sitter. If you live in the US (I don't know the laws outside of the US), your parents leaving you alone with your brother for extended periods of time could be considered neglect. Calling child protective services on your parents might be the best option. They need to be there for you.

One more thing... See if you switch to public school. It sounds like your parents are making you homeschool so you can babysit your brother. You shouldn't be spending all day with that boy. School might be the perfect escape."
68,"Who treats you and your property better *and* has personally been with you longer? 

That's who you want to keep."
69,"In my experience, the kind of bars that are not appropriate for under-aged kids to eat food in will card at the door and won't let them in.  Whether or not drinking out around a kid is appropriate will depend on who you ask, but I'd think that the majority of people here wouldn't be bothered by someone having a beer or two in front of a teenager.  It's not like they were binge-drinking."
70,At that age you find a pretty confusing mix of maturity and immaturity. It seems like everything's OK and then something ridiculous pops up.
71,"It's a good idea, but your mother may be concerned that a ""trial break"" means you won't ever put it back on, and stray further from the faith instead. 

There are Muslim women who take off the hijab and don't put it back on. Likewise, there are those that return to it.

I would imagine if you mention any kind of trial break your mother is going to ask how long this break is going to be, and may expect (perhaps unconsciously) that you'll resume taking up the hijab after it ends, or at the least that you'll revisit this conversation with her. If you do not intend on putting the hijab back on, I wouldn't say this. However, from your OP it sounds like you are still personally connected to Islam. So if you see yourself becoming more religious or returning back to the hijab sometime in the future, you might want to say that you know your mom's there for you and you would turn for her for that support. But I would even be a little hesitant saying this, and I would not suggest an immediate trial period, because either one could give your mom false hope."
72,This dude is trolling hard
73,She shouldn't have to tell him? He doesn't have a right to know?
74,"You're  taking this too personally. 

They are talking about people who are there daily or nearly so. 

I had friends adopt a 2 year old and I didn't get to meet her for 6 months. 

No one was allowed to even touch her except her mom and dad for a year.

Parental bonding is a very real thing.  It effects a person's entire life. 

Physical touching during the first few years of life actually effects physical brain growth and the number synaptic connections. 

Experts are very clear on these things and that's why adoption has changed a lot in recent decades. "
75,"All normal means is that most people do it. Most people do not do this. Ergo it's not normal.

That doesn't mean there's anything *wrong* with it per se."
76,"I do get the way you feel, I have allergies and have had to make the decision to leave overnight/weekend getaways due to them and it's always a shitty situation when you've gotta leave the group. But you'll feel much better when you're home in warm clothes with a whole day to yourself before going back to work. And your friend will be fine. It'll be her decision to stay. "
77,"I wouldn't ever lie about something to a partner. Literally, about nothing.

But well, I'd prefer not to answer that question if my current SO wasn't the best."
78,"The thing is, you say you're not putting blame on women, but when you say that you can't trust women because of this, it's exactly what you're doing. 

You can not want to be in a relationship, and there's nothing wrong with that. But saying you don't want to be in a relationship because you can't trust women based on **one relationship** is assuming all women will cheat based on one woman's actions. 

Seriously, I suggest talking to a therapist - they might have another view/opinion on this ""female psychology"" stuff, or at least might help you navigate dealing with other peoples' reactions. "
79,"You are responsible for your child's health and well-being. A baby getting cold can really harm them and possibly even be fatal. It sounds like this isn't the first time something like this has happened. On e is an accident. Multiple times is neglect. 

Neglect doesn't have to be intentional. But you need to think about the impact on the child. "
80,"I was dumb enough to tell an ex of mine once that her boobs were the largest I'd ever like. Never underestimate the stupidity of boys. 

If he sees your height as a flaw, that's a red flag. I don't know, if it's a self confidence issue that you infer he sees it as a flaw or if he actually does. 

I'd trust your gut though. Be open to other meanings and make sure you're not reaching the wrong conclusion, but if you're the one getting the impression so you're probably right :) "
81,"Laugh at him.  

""You're hilarious!   Anyways, I'm heading over to moms, (or bffs or mutual friends ) this weekend.  Let me know how it goes camping with the dogs.""

Just laugh it off because its hilarious.  Dont let him get to you.  Or leave the dogs with you.    If he gets mad just say,

""Its called responsibility.   Grow the fuck up.  WondermentParty OUT!!!""  And take off ."
82,"My husband's nephew (he's our age/the son of husband's much-older brother) got married a few years back. Later told us he knew he didn't want to do it the second he proposed. Said he sat on the front lawn the whole night before the wedding thinking, ""What the hell am I doing?"" but too scared to back out. A hellish year followed before they finally split. DO NOT GET MARRIED if you do not want to. It will be so much harder and more expensive to get out if you go through with this.

And holy fuck she BLINDED YOUR DOG?! I would have had her arrested (hell, I'd probably be in prison for what I'd do to someone who hurt my dog). Get the fuck out, OP. My God. Why would you propose to a violent animal abuser? Nevermind, it doesn't matter. You have to dump her. Jesus."
83,"You checked your phone messages while driving for 15 hours on winding mountainous roads?

Your GF was 1000% in the right here and if I was here I'd be just as angry.  

Also in what sense did this ""get physical""?  squeezing your unwanted-groping-hand and pushing it back at you?  Really?"
84,Please stop using bipolar to describe feeling indecisive.
85,"The unfriendly tone of my comment is perfectly reasonable under the circumstances. I did provide OP with help - he needs parenting classes. There's the help. That might go a little way to show his wife that he's not a completely incapable moron.

Edit: I just realised your account isn't the same as the OP so I've changed the comment... is this all you do? Go around making basically the same comment on different posts?"
86,"You've been dating for 3 months. You should still be thinking the sun shines out of her ass and she can do no wrong; you *definitely* shouldn't be ""beyond frustrated"" with her.

For the record though, I would find it super condescending to have a boyfriend I basically just started dating decide the way I live my life isn't good enough for him and he has to try once a week to mold me into the person he wants. You think you're helping, but relaxing for a few months after graduation is just as justifiable a position as getting a shitty job just so you can say you're working. You're gonna have to either accept that she can run her own life and stop playing ""daddy knows best"" with her, or end it because you're not interested in someone who doesn't value work like you do."
87,"No, in retrospect I didn't as I knew it's piss my fiancée off. I texted the woman, explained the situation and apologized, and blocked her number. "
88,[removed]
89,"If she really does this often, you shouldn't be caught off guard too much. But despite this, you could just say that you miss/want her, or about the shower comment, you could say something like ""can't wait for you to get back so we can do this"" (if you don't mind doing it of course).
She is just trying to be playful, possibly missing the intimacy, therefore seeking intimacy over text, which is fine.

Shrugging it off with a joke is pretty much like if she starts trying to be sexy in person, caressing you, but you awkwardly smile, stand up, and go to another room."
90,Makes you wonder where the anxiety came from....
91,"Seriously! I vote GF break up with OP. His friend is shit and his defense of his friend makes me think less of him.

"
92,"OP is asking about his 34 year old wife, not his 4 year old daughter. 

She obviously has major issues but OP has no right to just ""take her iPhone away"" like a parent taking a toy off a child. That won't fix anything."
93,"Unless it's to just quickly drop something off people in my life know better than to just show up on my door step. 

I don't even have a doorbell anymore. 

There's zero excuse to not just send a quick text these days. "
94,"&gt;politely tell the other girl that you have a fiancee and can't be her pal, if you haven't already.

I would phrase it something like ""I didn't realise it at the time but have since learned that the other night was my uncles' shitty way of trying to get me to cheat on my fiancee with you. I'm really sorry, but having learned this I don't think we should hang out. I hope you have a nice time settling in town besides this weirdness!"" Put the blame where it belongs, let her know that it wasn't anything either of you did that ruined it."
95,"If I can be honest, you sound really overbearing. 

Some people just go through this in their lives for any number of reasons. A point in their life when it's hard to find motivation, hard to find what it is that makes them tick, and hard to get excited about something. Some people never snap out of it, but most do. The thing is, you can't do it for her, she has to do it on her own. You might not think you're putting pressure on her, but I'm willing to bet she's picking up on your vibes, and it's only making the situation worse. 

You've only been together for 3 months! Just focus on yourself and stop telling her what point she should be at in HER life. "
96,"You did nothing wrong. You respected her boundaries, sought her consent, stopped when she asked, let her lead the entire situation. You played everything by the book and did absolutely nothing wrong. She gaslighted you.

Truth be told, she sounds like an extremely emotionally manipulative person. She clearly has some serious issues, perhaps related to her past trauma, but her behaviour was manipulative and toxic. (Gaslighting you, making you feel guilty for obeying her own wishes, twisting your words, accusing you of things you didnt do) This is very toxic behaviour, maybe its not intentional (like I said, could be related to her psychological problems) but it doesn't change the fact that its very manipulative behaviour. 

Either way, this was classic gaslighting. You did nothing wrong and have nothing to feel guilty for. 
I know it will be hard but you need to move on and dont even consider getting back with her- she has serious issues that she needs to get help for."
97,"Your husband immediately going to his mother is absolutely absurd. If I were you, I would make it clear to him that your private conversations are just that - private - and until he is willing to keep them that way you won't discuss the issue again. 

I literally can't imagine my mother calling my SO about our relationship. Insanity. "
98,"She might be saying that stuff to convince herself that the move is good and that she is fine, but she might, deep down, be having a harder time with it than she expected. 

Make sure you're super appreciative of positive things she does and anything she does for you. 

Emotional constipation = vagina shut down. 

Whatever she's afraid to talk to you about is affecting her libido. And if you've started to add further pressure to that stress by saying your sexual needs aren't being met, it's only going to get worse.

Master saying things like, ""Thank you for telling me! I love you so much and it makes me feel so good knowing we can talk about stuff."" (In your own words so it's not so cheesy)."

100,"&gt; My bff is a lawyer, and her husband is a SAHD, and they are constantly fighting because he's always sticking the baby in the playpen and playing WoW. For hours every day. Babies need stimulation, and speech, and constant care, IMO. So then my BFF comes home at 6:30, cleans up the house, does the dishes, makes dinner for both of them, bathes and feeds the baby, puts the baby to bed, etc. She's burnt out.

Man. Legally separating* and hiring a nanny and a maid would probably be cheaper and improve her life.

*If they divorce, she would probably have to pay alimony."

104,"Seriously, her list can apply to just about anyone in terms of what they think about themselves. I sound perfect for her too, nevermind the fact that I'm a woman and she might not be into that and she's never met me and we've never had a conversation, I hit her checklist so we're perfect right???? Better hook me up with her number because we're soulmates as far as I'm concerned."
105,"I hope not as well, the cynic in me just reacted to that. Sounds like you and bf have cleared things up nicely anyway so focus on building and enjoying your new level of trust and communication, the rest will shake out in time :)"
106,"Trust your instincts. Her story of not wanting to upset you for hanging out with someone you've never stopped her from hanging out with makes no sense. She told you half the truth as a cover for the rest of it coming out. She cheated on you.

Regardless, the trust it gone."
107,"Just end it. Why even confront her? You asked her to stop speaking with him bc it made you uncomfortable and she didn't stop. Tell her you know they've been in contact again and that you're done. Don't drag this out and make it any more dramatic. She made her choice, and it wasn't you. Why choose to be with someone that doesn't want to be with you? You deserve better. Break up and move on. "
108,"That's the thing... it doesn't sound like he wants to pick up after himself during the week, either. 15-30 minutes a day keeping the messes at bay and an hour on the weekend would probably be fine, but he is upset she picks up his empty soda cans when he leaves them behind. Is he planning on leaving all the daily detritus until that special hour on Saturday?"
109,"You can't ""disable"" because it's not an app. It's just a website that you put someone's phone number and they track it via GPS. Nothing needs to be downloaded on the stalked phone.


The only way to not be tracked by this website is to turn off the phone or disable the GPS entirelly, but then you'll lose other funcionalities like Google Maps.


The only way you know you are being tracket it's because they are forced by law to send a monthly text essage saying that they are tracking you. So maybe you can try to have some attorney involded in removig your number forever, but it won't be as simple as uninstalling an app from the phone."

112,"Yeah seriously. And I have a small home, a wild-child toddler, and two dogs, and I spend a lot more than one hour a DAY cleaning. And I'm absolutely not a neat freak whatsoever; my only concerns with cleaning are health and sanitation. But even just based on that, I still spend what amounts to at least a couple of hours daily on cleaning-related tasks. If I cleaned for an hour a week (even if you take a narrow view of ""cleaning"" and put tasks like laundry, giving your child a bath, etc. into a different category and solely talk about things like garbage, dishes, mopping, sweeping) we'd be living in such filth that it would be a health hazard."
113,"I think an hour is what you think it takes when you have zero clue what cleaning actually involves. 

If you've never considered that besides picking stuff up and vacuuming a bit and clearing a table and running a dishwasher you might also have to do other things like mop and wipe counters and sanitize bathroom fixtures and clean windows, furniture and appliances and doors and baseboards and you name it.

I have three kids and five cats, I can legit spend my entire day cleaning in between other chores and errands. "

117,"Badly. There's a small possibility they'll accept it and move on, buy I have seen families who loved someone's ex and never got over it. To the point of trying to sabotage it, bringing up the ex in the wedding toasts. Thirty years from now, they could be watching op's kid graduate and turn to op and say ""That should be Paul's child"".

It sucks. It's really hurtful for both the person and the significant other.

122,"Shit, I'm shocked you even visited them yearly. Seriously, they don't deserve you, especially seeing as after everything they did and continue to do you, you still treat them kindly. My advice is to cut them out of your life asap.  You've already done more than you ever should have done for them, so don't feel guilty about leaving them for good now."
123,"Also, a 23yo dating an 18yo is a pretty big red flag. Those five years make a lot of difference at that age. Like, he sounds sweet, but that's a big thing to look out for. 

Just don't plan your life for this guy yet, OP. It sounds lovely but you may find some problems down the line. "
124,"This, OP – even when I was as old as 7/8 I wasn't allowed to attend a close relative's funeral. Retrospectively, it would have been much harder to see the mass sadness / devastation than simply join the party after. I'm so sorry for such a horrific loss :("
125,"You sound 14, not 19. "
126,"So here is the problem - your wife being a 'public figure', your in-laws being the primary child care, and you doing as your wife wishes for years now - a ""family court"" will lean pretty far in your wife's favor for custody and so on.

Also - you lost your son - it's very likely that NONE of you have fully healed from that yet - and it's very likely that a LOT of the current ""family dynamic"" is based on an overly cautious idea that every precious moment needs to be spent with family because 'what if' another tragedy happens.

So you really do need to make a decision - put your foot down and demand family counseling.. Or get yourself a couple books on divorce and family law - and start preparing for the inevitable divorce in a way that protects you, your daughter, etc.

And stop dismissing and minimizing the words and actions of your wife and her family - if you continue thinking 'oh she is bluffing' - she will be the one walking away from divorce court with EVERYTHING SHE WANTS."
127,"If she told him she's been wanting to get a face tat, then yes.

128,"I believe the emotional abuse and physical abuse will definitely escalate. He has made no effort to change and his actions make it perfectly clear he has no intention to and why would he? You're still there, everything is working perfectly fine for him. 

So please breakup with your boyfriend. You're still very young and have years ahead of you. I know 8 years feels like a lot, you probably think you have invested too much time for it not to work, but think about it like this, if you invest another 8 years and things have not changed, that's 16 years. You're digging yourself into a deeper hole every minute you're still with him. Better to break up now that you're 25 than when you're 33. I mean it's never too late to leave an abusive relationship, but it's also never too early. 

This is coming from someone who has been with her boyfriend for almost 11 years. We met in high school, I love him deeply, but if he slapped me, swore at me or emotionally abused me I wouldn't have doubts about leaving him for a second. I know for a fact that if I was the emotionally and physically abusive one he would leave me too, because despite how long we have been together and how much we love one another, we love and respects ourselves as well.

Don't be afraid of change or the unknown. Don't let fear and the love you have for him keep you from loving and respecting yourself. That should be the most important thing."
129,"I don't have the solution, but I don't blame you for being nervous. Everyone is comfortable with different things, and to me I'm not comfortable with my SO blatantly flirting with other girls. It's not wrong for you to feel worried based on his behavior. "
130,"Like the other posters already said, it sounds like this type of situation wasn't an isolated incident. 

No sane person is going to leave their child with someone if they don't feel like they're safe with them – parent or otherwise. Try SHOWING her that you understand the gravity of what could have happened by taking steps to make sure this (or something else like this) doesn't happen again.

Examples: Get a better lock for the back door, remove distractions from your life, take a parenting class, contribute to household tasks, childproof the house, etc.

132,Hey I just wanted to let you know what happened this afternoon after I purchased this book on my iPad. I was at home by myself while my partner was out with a friend and I started reading the book and it led me to get a mirror and actually look at my clitoris which I've never done before. I got really turned on for some reason and got out my vibrator which I haven't done in a long time and I had the most intense orgasm I've ever had. Quickly followed by another. My partner came home a few minutes later and I initiated sex and had 3 more orgasms. I told him what happened and he was like wow and he wants to read the book with me.  Anyway sorry for going into detail but it was pretty mind blowing and it was thanks to your advice!! Can't wait to read the rest of the book :) 
133,"This dude sounds very codependant. Definitely a huge red flag. It doesn't mean he's a bad person, just that he is not in the position to be in a healthy relationship. If I were his friend, I would tell him that he needs to be happy with himself before he could be happy with another woman.

That being said, you should definitely not move in together at this quick a pace."
134,"You know what's so funny? He's usually awesome under stress. It's just very specific events that trigger his anxiety. I think with a little bit of help, he could get it under control.

I asked for the name of the oral surgeon that our dentist recommended, but he wouldn't give it to me. 

I'm going to talk to him again tonight when he's not in the midst of panicking about it and say pretty much what you said. I'm going to try to avoid an ultimadum. That will be my last resort. Thank you for replying! "
135,"Yeah, and they don't stop to think ""Hey, why do I expect my wife to do more than her fair share just because she has a vagina? *That's very shitty and unfair. I better fix this."" It's not that they don't know, most of them do know that the woman does more (they still underestimate the work their partner does because they never had to do it themselves, and they completely disregard emotional labour/the mental load, but they still do know that they aren't doing 50%). Some men think that's right because they are male and housework is female work, and they deserve more free time because they are men. That are the people that haven't figured out what everyone else figured out in the last 30 years, and that's likely because they are dumb and ignorant. Then there are men who know they  are doing less, and that they don't get flak for it because they are male, but they are just so lazy and try to gaslight their partner or act like they are convinced they do their fair share/act like they are absolutely unable to do housework as to get out of having to do it. Both kinds are assholes and I wouldn't touch them with a million mile pole. 
* ""They"" are men who don't do their fair share. "

137,"Judges don't care about cheating. It's all formulas nowadays. He has enough ""proof"" - she's a known cheater, she's been staying out way later than normal, she bought Plan B. Digging around more is just wasting time and delaying the inevitable."

"
140,[removed]
141,"Screenshot it, send it to her, and tell her ""I saw BFsName on here, hope everything is ok, not making judgements, just want you to have the info. Love you sis""

Let her decide what to do with the info. It could be completely innocent or it could be a cheating situation. He could be inactive, they could be in an open/different relationship than you realize, or he could be a cheating douchecanoe. Either way, send her the proof, and let her do with it what she will."

TL;DR - If you want to know what happens when you detonate a nuclear bomb, go ahead and push the big red button. "
145,"Yeah she's using you as a free babysitter and has no intention of getting back with you. She has an epiphany that means she wants to be with you but rather than you know..spending time with you, she dumps the kid on you and bails?  She's massively using you.  "
146,"Uh yes, certain situations have certain standards of dress. "
147,"That's fair then. She wants something from you and in return, you'd like something from her. If she refuses to budge but still insists you please her, she's being unfair. So again:

Then it sounds like you want to be single. Being in a relationship, even if you're refusing to put the ""girlfriend"" label on something that clearly is that, means that you do have to consider the feelings of your partner, because you're meant to be a team. You broke a promise because you found something that was more fun and didn't care if it would upset her - these are not the actions of a partner, or someone on her team, they are the actions of a single person without anyone else's feelings to consider but their own.

From the sounds of your moving out due to incompatibilities, you're just dragging out the death of this relationship due to both of you not wanting to be the 'bad guy' who breaks up."

152,"Yeah, your sister needs to clarify exactly what happened and kick her husband arse. It seems line she accepted your reason for not going out then the husband didn't. She needs to give him an emotional slap "
153,"Something I've noticed just from your posts here is that you often go straight for negative responses when you're addressed.  I used to have a friend who did exactly this.  It's kind of depressing and exhausting to talk to someone who is constantly a downer.  It's the reason he is no longer my friend.

You say your depressed.  I think this might be driving your attitude.  Unfortunately, depression has a nasty habit of being self-reinforcing.  It makes you feel hopeless, irritable and withdrawn, which are all things that make you depressed!

My advice is to start being happy for other people.  Remember what people have going on in their lives and remember to ask them about it!  I keep a journal/notebook where I jot down notes about what's going on with my friends and it's super helpful.  Things like, ""Matt's looking at getting a boat, Sarah went camping with her boyfriend for the first time,"" etc.

This will do two things: 1. it will demonstrate that you care about these people, 2. keep the conversation away from you (where you're likely to turn it negative) and focus it on the other person (who you're trying to be happy for).  You'll start forming real relationships with these people, and perhaps they will help build back your self-esteem.

 Odds are, if you start becoming more friendly and engaged with these people, they are going to appreciate you remembering their cat's birthday and will be like, ""oh /u/shyandignored, you are so nice to have remembered.""  If they ever compliment you, say **thank you**.  Not, ""oh, no I'm not"", or anything that diminishes what they are saying.  It's pretty annoying to say something about someone and have it thrown back in your face. "

161,"By staying You are showing your daughter that it is ok to be in a marriage where one person refuses to compromise and makes unilateral threats like "" I will take her away and you will never see us"".

163,"His attitude is all wrong for reasons others have gone into.

But I don't think your method of ""helping him help himself"" is working. If he has a craving for pad thai, tell him to make pad thai. HE looks up the recipe, HE reads it, HE does the prep work and the cooking.

If you found the recipes for him and told him what to chop, it's already your project. You're the director. So it's not surprising that he looks to you for guidance the whole way.

Maybe he's the type that likes cooking without a recipe, and he might get it ""wrong"" but hey, at least you have a meal. Maybe he wants to read just one authoritative recipe, and follow it precisely. Maybe he likes to do as you suggested, and consult a few different recipes for ideas, then modify it based on his experience and what ingredients he has. But the last one is probably the most difficult because it assumes a certain level of confidence.

Honestly it doesn't sound like he has the skills to do any of those approaches. He might not even know what ""type"" of cook he is. I think you're trying to help him learn, but assuming he is really motivated to cook, it might be better to get him to do the entire process, instead of picking up partway where you left off. That way he will be invested in the meal as his own project.

As I type this I'm realizing how sad it is that you have to strategically coach him into basic adult skills. But I think you should just say, ""YOU'RE making dinner. I don't care what or how or if it's perfect. Just do it."""

My parents didn't divorce until after I finished college (and wouldn't have divorced at all if he hadn't cheated and insisted that God was totally fine with him having two wives at one time... they're Protestants, that's not a thing). My brother and I were miserable growing up and both wish they would have divorced much earlier so we didn't have to grow up listening to them fight."
171,"&gt; Something keeps telling me they're meant to be, and that I should break up with him so they can find each other.

That is insane. They don't even know each other. The profile people put online is not even what they're like irl.

172,"How are the churches near you? The volunteer clubs? Those are good places to start, where you get under people, feel useful and get the 'wholesome' side. The positive interactions.

173,"This is good advice! I have been married for 26 years. We've had arguments and many, many discussions. I have never been slapped or called names. I have never slapped and called names. This is abuse. 

OP and her partner are at an age where they are fully cooked so to speak. His language is violent. Move forward and move on. The pain in that now is nothing compared to the pain after children etc. "
174,"This. This, so much. She could accidentally be giving them information and they could think she owes them real life reparations for their money. As someone who's had cyber stalkers from online dating websites (accidentally gave one guy my first name, and when I didn't want to go on a date wth him he reverse-searched some database of emails at the local universities to get my email and send me notes that he knew where I lived) this stuff isn't safe. She's 16. She's a kid. She doesn't know what she's doing.  "
175,Yeah I mean the amount is definitely adjustable based on whatever insider info you have. I just think it's a nice idea to contribute some money to her future also.
176,"No... but it may make her mom understand the enormity of the betrayal and perhaps forestall her having to cut off family relations, which might be even more painful. No... she shouldn't have to. But it may save heartache in the long run. Just my 2 cents. "

179,"So she slept with you when you were intoxicated? Unless she was equally wasted, that's incredibly fucked up for her to do. Even from her reaction, this girl sounds incredibly immature and poor at communication.

Send her a text. ""I have no clue what happened. I was drunk. Whether you believe that or not is up to you. I have a lot of questions myself so if you feel ready to talk about this at any point let me know."" And then leave it be and pray to whatever God you believe in that she isn't pregnant.

Watch your drinking from now on dude, nothing good ever comes from getting blackout wasted."
180,"Of course he does. Well if he avoids it, just tell him he's choosing between his brothers and his child. Not picking a side is still choosing against you. People like this, they always think they're doing the right thing not picking a side, like that's somehow commendable to not defend a victim."
181,"&gt;Why is it so hard for him to just do it if he really has these feelings for me?

What you're expecting is kind of a child's fantasy how marriage and proposals work. This is not how it works in real, adult relationships. 

He can't read your mind. For all he knows you don't want to get married. Engagements are not a surprise. Adults discuss things, look and buy rings together. How the ring gets on the lady's finger is the surprise part, not whether you're getting a proposal or not."

186,"This is both rude and terrible advice. OP, just ignore this. Your father showed his true colors, and it's probably best to continue no-contact for a while. Support your mom and the rest of your family as y'all continue to deal with the fallout from this. I'm sure he's upset and reeling from all the changes, but he made his own bed. Now he gets to lay in it. Both he and that woman sound like pieces of work, perhaps they deserve each other."
187,"and potentially far more dangerous. someone who can barely cook shouldn't be using one. they'll just shrug if they see a puffed up bag, smell it, and use it anyway."
188,or you could just sell both places and divide the profits. you could maybe move into a cheaper place. i know you hate the idea of dislodging them but she apparently didn't think anything about you or them when she decided to kamikaze your marriage. she can take responsibility for finding another place for them to live.

Its not enforcing any stereotypes. Its not causing violence or harm to anyone. His pronounss are male pronouns, and he has a right to male labels. Boyfriend is a male label. He has a right to his labels and pronouns. You do not get to dictate peoples labels and pronouns, no matter if they are trans or cis. People have a right to feel how they feel, and choose their pronouns and labels that match them.

- You are casually racist/sexist/some other ""ist"". 

- You dress badly 

- You have poor hygiene 

- You have some sort of unattractive physical quality that is not obvious in your photos (I know this is a minefield to mention, but if you are bald or overweight or something and they can't tell from the photo some women might not be attracted to you).

The good news is these are mostly very easy fixes, so do a thorough inventory (maybe with a trusted friend) to see if any of these could be a problem.  I'm sure this must be very frustrating, I hope you can figure it out. 

Good luck!"

200,"It's kind of gross how you're reading your sisters account without her knowing. For a lot of people Reddit is an anonymous place where they feel like they can express themselves, sometimes the ONLY place they feel like they can do it. 

This is like reading her personal journal. You need to stop doing this. I'd highly advice you not to tell her you know her account and have snooped through it. Her reaction would probably be severe. "

Like, go into it knowing that you are not giving them any new information, you aren't going to change their minds, that you are doing this so you can feel like you at least gave them the opportunity, and that you acknowledge it is probably a wasted effort on your part. 

You know if they haven't addressed this by now they are not going to any time soon. You can't save him or them. You can't make any changes or improvements to their lives BUT you can improve your life by moving forward. You are NOT responsible for him or any of them. "
203,"Talk to someone other than your bf about your feelings and choices.

There is a *very good chance* that this pregnancy, whether you keep the baby or give her up for adoption, will be the end of your personal relationship with this man.  Do you think he will stay with you all through pregnancy and childbirth, and maintain your relationship afterwards?

&gt;I actually want to keep the baby

You have the absolute final say in this.  Please do not do something because you feel pressured.

&gt;other reasons my boyfriend pointed out is that i'm nowhere near ready to raise a child &gt;.&lt; unfortunately, i have a learning disorder and other delays.. i'm slow and have trouble keeping a job. so in combination with all these reasons, it's not a good idea.

I think your bf is telling you that *he* is not ready to raise a child.

These other issues he mentions of a learning disorder, delays, slowness -- does anyone other than him think these things will keep you from being a good parent to a baby?  Do you doubt your own ability to learn how to raise a child?

Adoption can be a very good thing, but it is not the best choice for everyone.  

There are social programs for single mothers that will help you through your pregnancy, teach you how to care for yourself and an infant, sometimes even provide housing and food assistance, and education or job training.

On Monday, call the nearest social services office and ask to talk to someone about enrolling in a prenatal program and getting signed up for Medicare.  Whatever your final choice is (and you don't have to make that choice right away) you must get proper medical care so you have a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby.

Do you have family or friends who you can talk to, or who might help you? 

Your bf has given his opinion, and you have listened to his reasons.  I think it would be a really good idea for you to talk to someone who will listen to *your* reasons for wanting to keep your baby."

Those are a lot of flaws she mentioned though. Some of them could be corrected with enough care about fixing it.

205,"My boyfriend was picky-er. I shut that down hard at the start. The same my grandmother and father did with us kids. 


I think his adult pickiness was perpetuated by 

1. Never having to leave his comfort zone as an adult 

2. Zero frame of reference for flavors or textures. He didn't even know how to start the adventure. It's easy to fear the unknown. 

An easy method I found was just cooking for my own work lunches and giving him tasting amounts right when I finish. At the age of 32 my boyfriend discovered he likes pesto. PESTO!

208,"As someone who had their brother find their blog when I was in college (the blog helped me process our childhood and my own issues), I think it's unfair that you keep reading her posts. You can, but ultimately it's not helpful. 

She has feelings, she is allowed to process those how she sees fit. She isn't your friend, she is your sister. She doesn't owe you a friendship, or a closeness that you desire. And her issues are her own. Maybe a better way to handle this is to ask her how you can improve your relationship, as it is something you would like to help facilitate if she was willing.

My brother attacked me about what I said, saying that I was wrong, and listing the reasons why. I told him that it doesn't matter if I was wrong, it was how I saw and felt that situation and that's what mattered when it came to what is a diary entry, essentially. He still hasn't forgiven me for the things I said, and it was even more proof that he is the person I thought he was. Sure didn't make us any closer.

You can't force relationships, and reading someone's diary/ventings is only making you seem creepy and sneaky. "
209,I think you're making way too much out of this.  So you're attracted to guys with a good build on them.  So what?  Are you ynattracted to your boyfriend?

213,"&gt; I think it would be unfair to punish Fred for having relatives who just won't listen to him, no matter what he says. He could shout and scream till he is blue in the face and still not make an impact upon them.

This part is important. Fred most likely can not and will not change or even get through to his family. No matter what he says/does. That will not be a failure on his part, he just can't. They already don't respect him, and argueing yourself out of a position of disrespect is hard, because they can disregard everything you say right away. 

He will probably fail in standing up for OP. That is OK, as long as he, eventually, starts distancing himself from them. That's the only thing that's likely to help."
214,"I'd like to add, depending on where OP lives it's not wildly uncommon in my experience for a child to move in with a non parent or stay with a family friend for a little while if there are problems at home (and ""I want to go back to school or work on getting a better job but don't have the support system in place to take care of him so I can work on getting us a better life"" counts as a problem in my eyes). Both my dad and my aunt and uncle took in friends of their children in high school and I was partially raised with the children of a family my mom was close to. Even just telling her you're overwhelmed and trying to make positive changes and asking if she could be his guardian on a temporary basis could seriously help. A medical assistant degree, for example, in my state takes about a year, and OP should still spend weekends and holidays with him in the meantime. "
215,"I don't think any daycare worker or adoptive parent worth their salt would agree to take a child on a 'trial period' off the books. How is that going to look to anyone who knows this woman? What if OP flakes and never comes back, and Tonya has a kid who she doesn't have any legal rights to but can't find mom? What if she wants to formally adopt again and she's got to explain this mystery 6 year old to the social worker or adoption agency? This a terrible idea, and anybody with any common sense would see it as a terrible idea. If OP presents it as Tonya taking Charlie for some longer periods of time purely to give her a break, sure. But as a trial period for an adoption? No way."

If you can make another bed somewhere in the house that is dark and quiet then that is another option. Anywhere has to be better than the van.

Also, why is he the one always sleeping in the camper van? Just because he is the light sleeper, shouldn't mean that he is punished. You seem less concerned by his inability to sleep, and more about how you don't get to cuddle with him!

Maybe you should 50/50 the time spent in the van so at least he gets some sleep too. As the heavier sleeper you might well sleep better there than him! You could even take the dog. 

His move to the van sounds like an act of desperation, and you don't sound very compassionate or concerned about his needs."

At night it varies, but usually I'm working from about the time I get home to the time I go to sleep. Sometimes it's just revisions based on the previous day's comments. Sometimes it's hours. I also usually work weekends on the design stuff which I forgot to mention. I try to do normal stuff with him like go grocery shopping or go with him to buy something we need from Home Depot, but when I'm home I need to design, then email, then wait for response, then revise or design more. So in a way I think I do prefer something less consistent because if I had to go from the spa to Walmart or something else where I needed to be there for hours for my shift, I really would not get ANY house work done at all and I think it would hurt my sanity even more probably! Despite that I do keep applying to jobs like receptionist at an office as well as apply to better paying jobs, I just never hear back. "

231,"I highly recommend r/loseit for problems like this. Not only is it a great source for weight loss tips, it also has a lot of good info about how to deal with people who are on your case about it. 
I had similar problems when I was your age. I gained a lot of weight my senior year of high school and first year of college, and I got a lot of criticism about it from my family. What hurt the most was hearing it from my Mom, who was herself morbidly obese. It was so hurtful because I felt like she was asking me to do something she was incapable of herself. 
For a while, my response to all the criticism was finding excuses for why I was so big, insisting that I carried it well, and trying to get comfortable with my new body. Simultaneously, I just blocked out the possibility that I might be able to look and feel different. I thought this was just how I was and I had to accept it. My weight fluctuated a lot in the next few years. Sometimes I would try diets and drop the weight, then regain it. 
My Dad eventually became ill with cancer, and I became his main caretaker. He had been kind of chubby before the diagnosis, and I watched him waste away and die. Taking care of him also took a toll on me physically. I gained weight again due to the stress, my skin got really bad, I was just a mess. 
After he died I took a hard look at myself. His cancer, while in some ways just unlucky, had risk factors such as being overweight, drinking too much and, eating rich foods. I'd always known that excess weight had real health effects, but I took the 'You only live once, eat the damn pizza"" kind of approach. Having that experience changed all of that for me and I got serious. Reddit was a great resource, not only r/loseit but also r/progresspics and r/fatlogic. R/progresspics is great because you can really see what's possible if you put in the effort. 

So I turned my life around. I realized that as important as it was to be comfortable with my body and to care for myself, it was equally important to try to take the best care of my body that I could, and if there was something I didn't like to take every possible step to improve it. I'm still not fitness model thin, and I'm not running marathons, but I've made goals and I work towards them and I really enjoy the fact that I've been able to change my life positively.

I'm sorry if that sounded like a really self absorbed rant. But what I'm getting at is that just like you, hearing those comments from my family made me want to shut down and ignore them, or just try to be happy in my own skin. Now that I've lost the weight I realized that the motivation always had to come internally, not from wanting to please anyone but from a genuine desire live a whole different lifestyle. Maybe tell them that if they really want to help, they'll help you find your own way. "
232,"&gt;. I told him once that he didn't need to use a condom anymore (I thought most guys would prefer this) if he didn't want to but he insists on using one.

Are you going sans-condom to please men? You don't have to put yourself at risk to try and get someone to like you more..... It's best to use condoms until you know you're in a long term, safe relationship. Under a couple years is a bit early to know if you can trust someone completely, it's also best to test multiple times before going sans condoms. Some stds can be undetectable for months. "

249,"&gt; But what I don't agree with is, why would she still talk to him or listen if he was so repulsive? 

Honestly? Because it's really easy to listen when somebody presents you with ""evidence"" of your deepest fears coming true. That's not to say that what she did is great, but it seems like from her point of view she was cheated on before, you knew that she was pretty sensitive about the subject, you started to act withdrawn (for perfectly good reasons, but I don't know how well you communicated to her *why* you kept ditching her), you started cancelling dates, she started to feel insecure and paranoid because she knows this pattern, and then, she's presented with proof! At that point, she's not thinking about who offered her this proof - she panics and dumps you because she was always afraid that this would happen and now it has!

I can't tell you whether you should get back together with her or not, or even if my scenario is still plausible after you factor in her personality. I just know how easy it is for anxiety and paranoia to run away from you and overwhelm you."

She probably could have handled you confronting her a bit better but I probably would have been put off by it as well. "

Personally, I don't see why she needs to be on full-time either.  If you need her for a few hours each week so you can work out or run errands or just see friends, then that's understandable.  However, it's kind of your job to raise your kids now, so a full-time nanny is excessive."

You weren't looking for anything serious, it's over now, you're upset with him, you're moving soon...  Let it go.  

&gt; Am I justified in thinking that he was trying to use me for sex when this other person wasn't ready to sleep with him yet?

Does it matter?  (Also, what do you mean ""trying""?  Seems like he succeeded?)

&gt; It seems to me like he treats some girls like sex objects and other girls like girlfriend material.

Sure, maybe?  Some people *are* sex objects (like, I dunno, the ones who are only looking for casual sex because they're about to move across the country).  Other people *are* partner material (for example, if they're looking for a serious relationship).  Those are both perfectly good things to be; there's nothing wrong with being either one, and most people are both and different points in their life.

He treated you different than his new girlfriend, yes, because you're *different people*.  And he seems to have treated you the way you wanted to be treated (casually, as a sex partner), so why are you upset?  Do you think he should have pestered his girlfriend for sex?  Or should he have pestered you for a relationship?  How would that have helped anyone?  Weren't you treating him as a ""sex object""?

&gt; Am I wrong to feel used for sex

No, you were being used for sex and/or casual companionship, and you absolutely should feel like it.  And?  That's not a bad thing.  (Now, it'd be interesting to know if his new girlfriend knows about you like you know about her.  If not, then he *is* doing something wrong.  But having a casual relationship until he's ready to have a serious one with someone else isn't obviously scummy; just efficient.)

284,"&gt;It's about commitment. OP has committed to his mother, then got this very large commitment forced onto him by his father. 

I would personally err more towards honoring the commitment to the person who has been most committed to me, and to be honest, it sounds like OP's mom hasn't been very committed to that role for at least 1/3 of his life while his dad and step-mom have been there.  Going off to teach English as a second language is something you do for an adventure in your early 20's, not when you have a teenage son who needs you. 


Yeah, his dad made some assumptions, but they're also at that awkward transition in their relationship from parenting a child to being the parent of an adult.  If OP was still 15, Dad would've assumed that of course he knows where his son will be without having to ask!  I think we can forgive him for not being fully adjusted yet.  It took my mom until I was almost 30 to finally accept that I was a grown person with my own plans and agenda.

If you and your husband are living off of one income, and don't have a ridiculous amount of play money, I do have to agree with him that having a nanny is really an unnecessary expense.

I don't say this to be rude, but moms have been caring for multiple children without the help of nannies since the beginning of time. It's gonna be okay :). Shit, if I had all the money in the world, I'd have someone come do my laundry for me every. fucking. day. Unfortunately, down here in the real world, that's merely a fantasy, lol. "
290,"So he's incapable of seeing this from your point of view, meaning he has no empathy. And he makes it about his feelings rather than addressing how his behavior makes you feel. Which could mean he's stupid and selfish, or gaslighting.

And, she has PPD, on top of coming down from having a newborn in NICU for *three goddamn months*. My son was there for nine days and I thought I was going to kill *everyone* with a flamethrower and then a baseball bat. And then go to work on them.

You guys went through *three months* of that. 

Look, your wife isn't healthy and her behavior isn't healthy and you need to talk about that. But if she had two broken legs, woul you be pressuring her for sex? No. Well, she's got the mental equivalent. Honestly, in her shoes it's a bloody miracle if she gets out of bed and goes to work without screaming, crying, or both. You need to give her a lot more time to come back to normal. She needs to be honest and open about doing what is necessary to get better, but she needs a lot of time to get better. 

Three months in NICU is anything but ordinary. It will take an extraordinary effort to get over this, for both of you."

295,"It might not be traditional hours. I know plenty of families with doctors or lawyers as one parent who do this. A lot of them have the nanny come from say, 12-8, to help with entertainment, errands, cleaning, etc. Is it a privilege? Absolutely. But for many of these parents, they are close to being a single parent. Can you imagine going from 7 in the morning to 9 at night with small children, who can barely talk, reason, and spend so much time crying? It's impossible to get anything done. In a lot of these situations, the working parent basically have no responsibilities in terms of chores and errands, because they just work too much. I even know couples where both work high power jobs, and often times they have two nannies with overlapping schedules (like nanny 1 from 8-5 and nanny 2 from 12-8). "
296,Well I think that your boyfriend is a pedantic ass who should mind his own business. Has there been anything going on in his life or in the relationship in general to cause this sort of behavior?

I would give it a timeline in your head, like, I'll commit to communicating with him very clearly each time it happens and if there is no decrease in the behaviour over the next 2 months, I'll move on. I'm not suggesting you set this limit with him directly since he doesn't seem to have any clue that he is dragging you down. When he does it, ask him why he has so little faith in you? or if he thinks you're so incapable, why be with you? Or say, wow! That makes me feel so incompetent, I'm pretty sure I've got this under control. I wish you believed in me. Etc. 

He needs to hear this type of response every single time he says something remotely degrading/condescending for this to work. If it's not changing, start laying the ground work and change your phrasing to, ""I can't be with someone who doesn't believe in me and celebrate my successes."" ""You're making me feel terrible about myself and this isn't a healthy way to live."" ""I won't be spoken to that way, I'm completely capable of completing this task without your input."" ""That comment was uncalled for and is hurtful and demeaning.""

If he only gets defensive and won't work with you to change, you'll have an idea of what marriage will be like. If he listens and changes how he talks to you, you might have a chance.

People with anxiety disorders (who are self-medicating or are untreated/unaware) are tough to stick with because their way of showing love is to minimize worry about the person they love. This leads to them wanting to limit their partner's activities, associations, and anything really that could be a risk in their mind. Generally speaking, relationships are much healthier when both partners are encouraging the other to get out and enjoy life to the fullest.

This could just be the tip of the iceberg. When anxiety disorders go untreated they have a way of intensifying and rearing their ugly heads as people age. Are you up for this if it gets worse? Or even if it doesn't and he just stays the same, how are you going to manage your growing resentment of this type of treatment?"

306,"You're choosing to do a job. There is no incentive on you beyond ""I like my parents"" and ""I need some extra cash"". You have made this choice. 

That's not comparable. 

The way things are right now, OP's parents refusing to pay for her college means three options:

* Take out exorbitant debt that will cripple OP for years, if not decades, to come
* Quit college 
* Figure out how to prove that she's been disowned to help qualify for aid

Technically, those are options. But it's not a fair one. It's very difficult to succeed without a 4 year degree, in some careers it's literally impossible. College is simply not affordable right now. It's even harder for people with rich parents that cut them off, because they don't qualify for aid. I know someone whose parents are rich. she's working for minimum wage, basically on a ramen diet, pays for everything- but she doesn't qualify for financial aid because her parents, who don't support her, are rich. 

OP could choose to do that, but it's a very hard road and potentially a lot of suffering. 

Her parents saying ""You either live like this, do this work for us, or we cut your funding"" is telling her that she has to choose between a reasonable living circumstance or her financial stability.

If a husband *EVER* treated his wife like this? Reddit would be up at arms, furious at the financial abuse. If an employer treated a live-in nanny/maid like this? Reddit would be pissed. But parents are allowed to treat their child this way? Fuck off. 

Money isn't everything. Agreeing to support someone doesn't justify mistreating them.

And, yeah, OP has no other options. So she has to suck it up and bully on. She has to either decide the mistreatment is worth the hardship and bail, or she has to hang on until she graduates. But this is not a FAIR choice and your post is condescending bullshit."

You brought up all the other relationship stuff between you because you thought it might be relevant, and you are right. He doesn't reciprocate towards you either sexually or otherwise. For some reason, it sounds like you haven't asked for a level of reciprocity in this relationship, but you might be hitting your limit here.

The fact that he doesn't want to have sex with you and deliberately pretends you are someone else - either a) he can't get the people he wants to have sex with so you will do and/or b) he likes the convenience, you act like a servant to him i.e a ""bangmaid"". 

The sex life you described doesn't sound very fun to me and I don't think you can actually change his level of attraction towards you. Or his level of empathy towards you (sleeping when you are upset etc).

But if you are really wanting to fix it I guess you could try talking to him to see if he wants to change, and explain your needs. It's not a big ask."

Love isn't enough. There has to be respect and trust, and that won't happen here. I am worried for you and I think that if you don't leave this man he will seriously harm or even kill you.

It's really great that you have reason to stay away in SoCal sometimes. I think you should secretly talk to some people who can help you make a plan for how to leave safely and to divorce in a way that will not work against you.

She had been hanging around and doing typical groupie shit, but it was so soon after they had split there was no way there wasnt some inappropriate stuff going on before. The babies were born very close. 2 beautiful babies. They are innocent in all this. The advice i gave my sister when she confided in me, was to just focus on herself. Be the best parent and person she could be. She was utterly defeated and ive never seen her so upset, but SHE GOT THROUGH IT. And you will too.

So he straight-up admitted that the only reason he doesn't want you to go is because he's bitter that he can't go, too. That's pretty shitty. I can understand feeling disappointed about having to miss out, but you'd think a supportive partner would still want you to go and enjoy yourself.

Hell, if you want my opinion, going into credit card debt for any reason other than an absolute necessity, including going on a vacation, is a horrible idea.

No? He can want as much sex as he wants. The person who wants it most often cannot expect the person who wants it least often to just have sex they don't actually want as appeasement. You need to respect it if he's not really consenting.

1) Masturbate.

2) Ask him *why* he doesn't want sex. Work on that. Communicate.

3) Spice it up, if the answer to #2 seems like boredom. Try new things.

4) Acknowledge that the two of you have incompatible sex drives and find someone who actually also wants to have sex 3x/week.

5) Consider an open relationship if both of you are comfortable with it.

Does he behave as though you're a child he needs to manage in other areas of your relationship?

It might be that now you're getting older and more independent (as happens when you move from early twenties to mid-twenties), he feels threatened and feels like he needs to assert himself over you.

But telling OP to ""wait and see"" on something that may be a deal breaker on both sides is just irresponsible.  If that's her life plan, they should have an honest discussion about it.

365,"They are actually, but they've been warped or misunderstood (except the gay marriage thing which is regrettably a fairly common belief though to various degrees of severity). Fasting an hour before mass is not enforced in the church anymore since before air conditioning was a thing people would actually faint during mass. But it did used to be a thing and catholics who consider themselves ""old school"" still do it. It's gotten easier to maintain since indoor climate control came on the scene. 

The ""back in time"" thing seems like a corruption of the largely philosophical idea that christ's sacrifice on the cross exists outside of time, so every communion is technically the same communion. It's weird and metaphysical so it's a concept usually only explored by hardcore religious nerds. It sounds like OPs parents either explained it poorly (easy to do) or misunderstood it entirely (also easy to do).

Missing church is a mortal sin I think according to the catechism but the important thing is that ""mortal"" doesn't mean ""unforgiveable"" or ""forever doomed to hell because you did a bad thing that one time."" It refers to a sin that has the potential to severe your connection from God. You can always reestablish that connection, but it would be harder than if you hadn't committed the sin in the first place so you know they try and discourage it. 

And yes unfortunately on the last one not having kids is grounds for an annulment. As is not consummating the marriage. Which is not to say catholics struggling with infertility automatically have their union rendered void, just that if one partner wanted to leave for more fertile pastures they would have grounds for annulment.

I want to hug you right now.  I'm so sorry your mother, the one person you thought you could count on, is rejecting you right now.  How awful. 😢

I would suggest going back to therapy to help you process this, because it's yet another loss of someone in your life that was supposed to love you unconditionally.  For your mother to reject you so cruelly is just unfathomable, and I think going back to therapy might help you.

You didn't deserve this.  This is not your fault.  Do you have friends and other family members to support you ?  It helps to have a support network.  Best of luck to you."

She's lying to you and you know she's doing it. She clearly thinks she can get away with it and has zero reason to be honest with you since there's no way for you to know the truth. 

I might give her one more chance to come clean. I would tell her very gravely that she has one chance to be honest about the extent and content of her communications with her coworker, and if she lied - again - the relationship is over. When she lied again, I would then get her to promise to cut back on communications with the guy as a danger to our relationship and see what she says. 

If she agreed, I'd document her continued texting, print out the record and mail it to her with a simple note:  

""We're done.""

Then I'd ghost her and let her drive herself crazy wondering how it was so easy for me to immediately go no contact as if she never mattered to me at all. 

I know, I know. All that sounds great but actually having the fortitude to do it is pretty rare and I doubt I'd be able to do it myself. But at least I can pretend to be a tough guy on the Internet!

In all seriousness, her pulling this would be the end of the relationship for me. Maybe I wouldn't be able to break it off right away, but I would not be able to trust her going forward and no trust = no relationship. It would only be a matter of time before I noped out with extreme prejudice. 

Good luck, man. She's pulling some crappy stuff and I hope you steer your way out of it. "

383,"We were originally supposed to go there just the two of us. She turned it into a massive dinner with friends and family (including my father whom I've avoided because when he's not happily forgetting that he used to beat my sister and I mercilessly growing up, he's asking me for money or trying to spread lies about my mother) without telling me until a few days after the calls were made. She clearly knew that I didn't want that prior to making the calls. I had told her as much when we made the plans to go just us. 

My girlfriend knows my family history. She also knows that I don't like doing things for my birthday. But she's also very family oriented and she always tells me that I should try to at least talk to my father and maybe move on from what he did ""because he's family"" and ""he's older now"". 

The resentments from her side are that I don't have the same views on family as she does. When it comes to a history like mine, I don't think family means shit. That said, I have a good relationship with my sister and our mother. I just don't like making excuses for family members who don't deserve it. 

My girlfriend also finds it annoying that I wait to speak up, and that I can't just go along with small things that would make her happy, like the birthday dinner. 

That's just a hard limit for me. If she had any hard limits, I would respect them. In fact she does. She's vegan. I respect that. I don't make her eat non vegan things or take her to places that aren't vegan friendly. I've never teased her about her being vegan either, which some people do. In fact I've slowly shifted my diet towards vegan since we started dating. "
384,"That's rough. But, you have to understand the gravity of what you considered ""edgy"" and a ""horrible phase"" has a lot more significance to her than it was to you, like ""people that look like me should be killed"" gravity, even if she does buy that you were just a stupid misguided kid and you aren't like that at all.

If there's any chance with her, I think you need to stop trying to make excuses for what you did (unless she asks you directly), and for god's sake, you have to know ""but some of friends are black"" doesn't prove anything, and just focus on expressing your feelings for her. Show her that you love her. That's going to be hard to do if she isn't talking to you, so maybe write her a letter."

Either way, don't mess up an innocent kid due to your emotional ineptitude. "

387,"She lives in the UK with the rest of my family so that's a no go. I can stay here on my own without him - I can even keep the flat if my landlord gives me a short grace period, which he likely would because he is a very cool guy and extremely laid back about formalities like that. I do not have bruising but in the recording he acknowledged repeatedly that it happened so there's that. 

My aunt is at least helpful to have, she used to be a teacher in prisons and is a lot tougher and stronger than him. She's only here for the weekend but it will give me time to work more out.

Our company does not have an HR department. I'm going to need to contact our CEO directly (he hired us both and knows us) to talk about how this will impact work for both of us. I sponsor him with my UK citizenship to live and work here in the Netherlands. I can withdraw this at any time. It usually gives the person being sponsored 3 months to figure shit out. However, I did read that ""was the foreign national aware of the reason to withdraw the recognition [sponsorship] or was he or she involved? In that case, the IND can instantly withdraw the residence permit."" So I need to talk to some officials about it. I already sent them an email so I'm waiting to hear back.

I think at this point I'll keep the lease and remove him. I have a good setup there and I'd have at least until December to find something new if necessary. But we'll see because I might need to just cut and run which would be shitty, but is on the table because of how this played out."
388,"You're just a walking bundle of red flags. You're in love with the girl you've been dating for two weeks? But you're freaked out that she has one more past sexual partner than she's previously mentioned? 

&gt;I thought sex actually meant more to her than this. That it wasn't rewarded to any guy that gives her attention.

Ugh. You have some weird attitudes about sex. But at any rate, you clearly aren't happy in this relationship anymore. For both of your sakes you should end it and find someone who's sexual history you feel you can live with. Which, from what I gather, would be no sexual history at all. "

If the two of you, after ten damn years, cannot have a conversation and compromise with each other about something as simple as dog sitting, you need to leave each other. You have no hope in the future - how are you going to deal with kids, your parents getting sick, a house, finances, etc, etc.

I would suggest telling your wife what you've told us.  That you think she's amazing, as you've said here.  That you feel like she can't really let go of hurt and forgive because she instead blames herself for being hurt.  And that you see her doing that now and that it hurts YOU to see that.  It does hurt you and you do care, or else you surely wouldn't be asking us here.  Make yourself vulnerable to her (as you have in some small way here.)

No relationship is perfect, but I can't imagine being married to someone that you're so miserable with you feel the need to shit talk them when they aren't around.  Why marry someone you hate?  Why stay married to someone you hate?  I don't get it."
406,"It is unreasonable for you to think that he can't go places just because you don't want to.  Why was it such a big deal that he wanted to go hang out with his friends?

He said, ""okay, no problem - I still want to go"".  And you...freaked out.  Like, crying, lost it, freaked out.  Who cares if you need to sleep alone one night?  As someone who has lived with my SO for almost 4 years now, I LOVE the random night I have the bed to myself.  Learn to love that stuff!

If he can't have your back on this he has no morals and his love is absolutely worthless. 

&gt;That's okay, I am vocal and can stand up for myself,

No, it's *not* okay. Having someone stand up for you isn't something needed only by people who are quiet and shy and can't stand up for themselves.  Wanting, *needing* a partner to be prepared to prioritise you is not a *weakness*. Like, you know the standard scene in the lady superhero genre when the male love interest is all ""oh no, fair maiden, I will protect you from these misreants!"" and she's all ""Haha, I already knocked them out all by myself!!"" That's fine, but she should still expect his response ""wow, and you looked amazing doing it, and those guys sucked for attacking you!"" not ""Huh,  anyway, I'm going to go for beers with your would-be murderers now.""

They will be a bit bummed but they will get over it. Don't worry so much about what other people think. What would you feel if it was the other way around? Probably be a bit annoyed (partly cause you wanted your mate to be there having an awesome time with you) but understand why. It will be fine."
443,"If someone had a pet tarantula they loved, and I said ""don't bring that around me please, I find it disgusting and I'm scared of it"", and they brought it out towards me, I would freak the fuck out.  I am cripplingly terrified of large spiders.

Sounds like she has a phobia, too.  I would just drop it and not bring the mouse around her again.  People can't really help their phobias and you should not, at all, be taking this personally."
444,"Exactly. They're trying to protect her, because they know how serious this is, and rightfully so. This guy is dangerous."
445,"&gt;. I didn't feel scared by this guy, just...annoyed? Like he seemed a bit immature and oblivious.

So let's say he truly is a bit immature and oblivious. He totally ignored you saying ""no"". That's pretty darned immature and oblivious. 

So what else is he going to be oblivious about? Do you want him to be telling off-colour jokes at a family funeral? Insulting your 16 year old niece's looks? Getting into a fight with a gang member? Or the tax collector? Perpetually falling for scammers and thus always being broke? Driving through red lights because he's that oblivious? 

There's a point where it doesn't matter whether he deliberately meant it or not. And he's crossed that point. A guy who is genuinely that oblivious is a walking disaster zone you should stay well away from. "
446,Apparently he cheated on her lol
447,"This is going to be really tough.  Keeping a secret this long would be a deal breaker for many.  It doesn't even matter what the secret is...just that for a year you've been not just keeping it from him, but outright lying (by saying you're on your period, lying about friends and family)...it's a massive betrayal. It would be hard to trust someone after you find out that they've been lying about something this big.  

I know it must feel like it's not a lie...that you've just been living your truth as you have felt your whole life...but it won't feel like that to him.  He'll be sad that you weren't able to tell him.  He might wonder what the future will look like since you won't be able to have biological children together.  A lot of things are going to go through his mind when you tell him.  It won't be a pretty conversation...and I think a big part of the difficulty will be because of the length of time he's known you...to find out something he thought was a given isn't...will be hard for him to accept.  

But you have to do this...to do this later will mean divorce.  At this point, he might be able to get over it.  Just give him time once you tell him for him to find acceptance.  

Good luck.  Update us...I hope it goes well :)"

456,"I would not tolerate such disrespectful behavior and I think your mom is deeply invested in an abusive relationship that you can do nothing to stop. His behavior is over the line and absurd. He's not ""trying hard to interact with you"" at all. He's a jerk. Full stop. "
457,"He has an incredibly toxic way of looking at finances, where he doesn't view you as an equal. This is how you treat your girlfriend of 2 months regarding expenses, keeping her off of the mortgage, having her pay rent, etc. This is not a good outlook for long term happiness with your SPOUSE. 

It's incredibly disrespectful of him to throw his wealth in your face. It's horrible either way, but it makes it funnier that it was gifted to him, but he touts it as if he has made some great accomplishment in life by amassing money, instead of it being fed to him. Imagine how he would react if you did something like this, ejaculating him for how much he makes. You don't, because you understand how toxic saying things like, ""Can you get approved  for that credit card or mortgage with how little you make?""

If he wants to buy a house himself, without his wife, then you need to understand why that is. Let him know that if wants to go buy a house himself, then he is free to do so. If you're going to pay rent, you might as go pay rent somewhere that you want to live, that you are not belittled in your own home. He can advertise and get all of the roommates that he wants, but if he thinks that his wife is going to pay him rent, then he can go jump off a cliff.

Their is no HIS money. You're married. If he wants to separate finances, then do it correctly by divorcing and then you can at least go find someone that values you and doesn't make you feel inferior because of your upbringing. Recommend counseling to him before he runs off to buy a house, because you two need counseling together."

I was sitting on a bench, feeling like complete shit, and he decides in that shitty moment to caress my back and tell me he likes me. The worst thing wasn't the friendship completely ending, it was the fact that it brought 5 years into question. Was he just my friend to get in my pants? Was that shit even real? It's awful.

Regardless, that doesn't mean that they don't love you as much, or that they aren't loyal.

474,"**NO!** You do NOT have to have repeat c-sections if you've had one previously. This is a gross and sweeping misconception that forces thousands of women back under the knife when it just isn't necessary. As long as you are relatively healthy, wait at least 18 months  between births, and haven't had previous uterine rupture, your body is (usually) more than capable of vaginal birth. Vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) is much safer than repeat cesareans, you also heal faster. C-sections are a **major** surgery and shouldn't be repeated unless absolutely necessary. Many older OBs will try to force repeat cesareans, but **if that's not what you want find another OB** ASAP. 

*Also, adding... For many women, a VBAC can be extremely healing after the trauma of an emergency c-section. "
475,"&gt;Divorce isn't really an option so she doesn't have to worry about that.

So... she DOES have to worry about you being miserable or incompatible in ways that would ordinarily lead a couple to divorce and salvage their happiness, but you won't do that because you're too religious so you'll just stay in a sad loveless marriage til you die?

And you don't think she should be worried?"
476,"I think his step father is right. I've always thought of marriage as uniting two halves of a whole. If you're at 50%, but he is still at 20%, it's not yet time to unite. It's not your job to help him get to 50%, that's his parent's job when he was kid and his job now. Once you start trying to improve him, you become less of a partner and more like his mom. You replace his own responsibility to change, the ""drive"" you're talking about. He only stops drinking after you ask him to, right? Like a mom asking her son to clean his room, and he pouts and puts it off. He needs to be the one managing himself.

If this is him trying, you're going to be blown away by the other men who already have their act together."
477,"One of the most frustrating and paradoxical parts of watching a loved one stuck in an abusive relationship is that friends and family members pointing out how fucked up and unacceptable their partner is makes them cling to their partner even more.

They feel judged that they have gotten into this situation and intend to stay there. Instead of accepting an offer of much-needed help from someone who actually cares about them, they see it as a criticism of them and they treat that offer with hostility.

If you can stay in some form of contact with your sister, try not to touch on her relationship. Just boost her self-esteem as much as possible if you can. Hope that she can come to the realisation on her own that this guy is seriously fucking dangerous. "
478,Sorry this happened. Please don't feel the need to apologize for finding out. Reddit's weird fixation with privacy trumps common sense sometimes. 
479,"I think you should just quietly get your own phone when you are able to. Then take your paid-for-by-parents-phone and either leave it in your dorm room or take it with you to class sometimes. Because if you tell your mom that you're getting your own phone, she will probably find some other way to try to control you. 

I assume your parents will be helping you pay for college? If so then just continue to keep your head down and limit the information your mother has access to. Get that education and become financially independent. "

481,"Can you be close friends with someone if they imply that their GF is  ""back-stabbing bitch"" and haven't apologized for this shitty behavior though? Is it possible to agree to disagree on this point? Also I missed the part about the group not backing you up and siding with R.  They all voted to kick you out.  Do they think all women are back stabbing bitches?  And so your BF instead kicked R out and now both of you are out of the gaming group and your BF is still gaming with all people who have stated to him that they actively dislike you.

I'm glad you found a new gaming group and that your BF are getting along, but this situation just seems weird to me."

2 of my cousins have adopted and in each case no-one that was not living in the house was allowed to meet their kids until 1-2 months...  (1 week seems far too soon for a big group).

I would call your friends and ask how he's doing...

484,"By the way, even after surgery, he'll notice you're not self lubricating at all. There will still be surprises."

486,"Ehh, everyone has something abnormal about them.

"
487,"Is this the first time he's done this? Because it seems like an overreaction.

I've never asked a SO permission to do anything. When it comes to going out I simply say, ""I'm going out after work with X, I expect to be home by Y; I'll text you if I think I will be later; I'll text you when I'm on my way home."" It makes no difference if I'm going for drinks or to a museum. That's how he behaves with me as well and it's worked for about 17 years. If I'm going out with friends he knows, I'll invite him and mostly he declines. We might text each other periodically, if it's a very long night, but we're not having drawn out conversations with each other either.

It doesn't matter what other men do, it ultimately comes down to whether or not he trusts you. If you've never had a problem with this, he shouldn't start one now."
488,"Personally I wouldn't do anything.   

Don't call, don't return the earrings at his work, just ignore it.   Carry one as normal the next time you see him but don't avoid him or act weird.

It's possible he's just being nice in a disabled way.  

And if not, anything he's got going on is all him, and no reasonable person would think there is anything about a relationship there.  Therefore he won't be a reasonable person, and talking to him further will just reinforce whatever strangeness may be happening.

Just carry on as normal.  "

490,It was a Pervocracy post.
491,"First off from an internet stranger and a woman your age, hey, I'm really sorry you're going through this, it must be so hard, and I hope you'll find someone wonderful soon. There is really just a chance that you haven't met that right person yet, and when you do, you won't regret any of this because it all will have led you to her. At least, that's the typical romantic bullshitty train of thought I used to cope when I was having trouble while online dating as well. 

Check out r/OkCupid/ and see if the people there will give you any advice or check out your profile. There's often a lot of helpful advice on that sub. 

Don't psych yourself out. If the woman is getting a ""desperate"" vibe from you, even if it's you second guessing feelings or feeling reluctant to be hurt again, she'll pick up on that and it will get in the way of your real chemistry. To avoid this, try to go into dates with no expectations. I know that's really hard, so maybe take a break for a little while like was mentioned in another comment, until you're not upset about how the process is going. I think this is probably the most likely thing. When I was online dating I felt very strongly if the guy was either too eager/into me prematurely or was desperate to have something work out and it put me off. Similarly for pessimism, or the feeling of exhaustion with the dating process. You can definitely give off the wrong vibes if you're in the wrong headspace. 

Definitely ask for feedback from the women you date. But, be prepared for it to not be too specific sometimes -- it genuinely could be a chemistry or compatibility thing, and not a you doing something wrong thing. They also won't really be able to sum up the ""desperate"" vibe if it wasn't too strong. But regardless, asking them for genuine feedback can really only help. 

Best of luck! "

518,"No problem man. Just to clarify on the loaded questions, sometimes you have to ask something outlandish to see what sticks. With my situation it was 

""So how come and how long you have you been fucking an amputee"" 

This sets her up to defend or reveal three points: 

Duration - confirming that it's happening and with a specific person

Action - confirming that there is a time line with a specific person

Or the Person - confirming she's had a timeline of her specific actions

Let it happen organically, but know that if you call out the suspicious act in question form you may catch her off guard. Also realize she will lie through her teeth during the confession. The actions, amount of time, and amount of partners will always be bullshit and  more than she's telling you. What you're confirming here is broken trust, not details. "
519,"But you're making it clear here that you would have argued, pleaded, not accepted her decision, and even now you don't. I think she made the right choice in not giving you that ability if her mind is made up. It's just more pain, possibly followed by her halfheartedly ""giving it a try"" for a few more weeks before breaking up with you a second time.

It'll take time to get to the point of living for yourself. You don't have to give up the dream of living in that country if you don't want. But I would start with working towards finding fulfillment in what you do; you have to be there 8 hours a day anyway, might as well be doing something you can be proud of at the end of the day.

Dollars to donuts, if he found you texting some other guy the same shit, you'd probably be subject to that temper he has a reputation for. Your SO is trying to play you. Don't be the fool."
521,"So, I have a good friend who recently got divorced and has a 7 year old daughter I babysit fairly often. She is sweet and funny but recently started doing similar things to what you described, but only when we were alone. Like she would ask me to do something unreasonable (drive her to Target so she can buy toys when it's past her bedtime and I don't have a child seat or child-friendly vehicle, let her eat candy, whatever) and when I said no she would punch me in the butt, which was kind of funny the first time but quickly became annoying/painful. She also hit me on the arms and choked me and elbowed me sharply in the ribs once when I was trying to leave the room and she wanted me to stay. After a couple incidents I sat down with her dad and told him what was happening, and said while I love her and she's a good kid, I'm not comfortable babysitting her anymore. I also told the child very firmly ""You are not allowed to hit me or anyone, ever."" 

The situation in this case turned out to be that she is coping very badly with her parents' divorce, going back and forth between two homes, and her parents starting to date. She just has all this pent-up frustration and fear and loss of control and it has been coming out in physical aggression. Seeing it in those terms helped me have much more empathy for her instead of just getting mad that this formerly sweet kid was suddenly awful to be around. She is now seeing a child therapist and her parents are both making a big effort to talk through her feelings with her and make life as stable and consistent as possible. These two things have made a huge difference. I babysat her the other night for the first time in months and she was a delight. Very sweet and just wanted to play quietly or snuggle on the couch and watch a movie.

The thing is though, dealing with this child's aggression in a healthy way is his parents' job. You can't make your girlfriend or her ex become responsible parents. Ignoring this issue and downplaying your worries is super irresponsible of your girlfriend. You can make suggestions, but if she doesn't listen be prepared to walk away."

523,"Her being a girl makes it so she doesn't deserve a father?

Ask him, bluntly, what about being a girl makes it so he can not bond with her. If he wants someone to do ""boy"" things with, fishing, playing games, hiking, etc - he can introduce all that to a girl too! Girls are also able to fish and play video games or whatever it is your husband might enjoy.

Ask your husband to spend some time introducing your daughter to his passions. Then maybe he will feel more emotional connection with her, once he realizes that a personality is not dictated by gender but rather by influence. Or does he think her entire life should just be limited to becoming someone else's maid, like you? (sorry)."
524,"Well, think of it this way- Do you want your daughter growing up with this as an example of how she deserves to be treated, and then become an adult and enter into a relationship just like this one? Because I would do anything to keep my daughter from reliving my mistakes. I'd much rather teach by example that this sort of behaviour is not acceptable than stick around being miserable with a husband who doesn't respect me or love his own child. The cycle continues unless you break it."
525,As someone else said - stay away from those two. I don't think it will be an issue then. 
526,"Yes, you should talk to your parents, because what your sister is doing threatens to rip your family in half.  In order to protect yourself, if she doesn't stop, you are going to have to stop being around her, and stop sharing any information about yourself with her, which means that you can only share information about yourself with your family if you trust that it won't reach her.

It starts by you insisting that you can't both be at the cottage.  Either she leaves or you do, and if you have to leave you will not forget how your parents let you down.  

And you should also go to the police.  It's time to get the ball rolling on a restraining order against your ex.  "
527,"Yeah I think it's time to just cut and move on. You're both still quite young, why try to force something if you're both not feeling it? "
528,"...did she ask you to make an effort? Because maybe she likes you in holey jeans, baggy sweaters, and beaten up sneakers. She wouldn't be the first women to prefer that to the clean-cut collared shirt look. Maybe she doesn't want to go to a five-star hotel in Prague, maybe she wants to stay in a hostel where no one cares what she wears and eat in tiny little restaurants that do carryout. Either she doesn't know she dresses inappropriately for situations or she knows and doesn't care. Try to find out if you are trying to fundamentally change who this girl is. "
529,"&gt; He doesn't know any trans people, and says he doesn't want anything to do with them. We talked and it seems he has much prejudice about trans people

If you dont want to be with someone transphobic, then break up with him. If you want future kids one day and dont want them raised around transphobia, break up with him. If you can accept that he is transphobic and dont mind your kids being raised around someone transphobic, then stay with him. "

Of course it's frustrating your chocolate didn't melt on the first try, but things like that happen every single day. If you respond to the little stuff like that with yelling and cursing regularly, you shouldn't dismiss your boyfriend's concerns. You definitely shouldn't dismiss the impact it's having on him regardless of whether you think your outbursts are healthy.

You may want to look into some therapy to brush up on your general coping skills. You'll be healthier if you're in a place where baking mishaps are just things that happen, rather than events that elicit an angry outburst.

552,"A narcissist is completely incapable of empathy.  If your therapist say that he is narcissistic, what that means is that he is not capable of thinking of anyone but himself and his own needs, and cannot and will not ever validate anyone else's, or be able to handle anyone else's emotions.

Trying to talk to a narcissist to convince them to care about your feelings is like trying to teach a fish how to climb a tree.  You can talk, talk, talk, give examples, role-play, make lists, do everything you possibly can, but *it will never work*, because he's just not capable of doing it.  He doesn't care about anyone but himself, and that will *never* change.  This is who he is.

You've settled for someone who doesn't care about how you feel and will never meet your emotional needs.  Sweetie, there is so much more to life than this !  You deserve someone who cares about your feelings and has empathy for your needs.  You deserve someone who is your emotional equal, and who can support you during the tough times (and vice versa).  You shouldn't have to settle for less.

I suggest you go to individual therapy to figure out why you chose someone who doesn't care about your feelings.  Was your father like this as well ?  I did the same thing, I married someone who was just like my mother, completely emotionally closed off and immature.  He's now an ex.  It's no good to feel alone in your marriage.  There's so much more to life than this.

Please go to individual counseling to strengthen your self-esteem.  Your husband will never change, and I know you're not ready to leave him yet, but you'll never get your emotional needs met if you stay with him.  Counseling will help you.  Good luck."
553,"I was once an animal crazy 16 year old girl. It was my dream to work with animals and I loved caring for our family pets. If I was running my own mini sanctuary at her age I would have been ecstatic.

She has over a dozen animals, including exotics and you are encouraging her to have more. Don't let your idealized perception of what you think her life should be shackle her before she's able to mature and develop.

She's 16 and she has a big heart, of course she wants to take in all the poor animals. However, the adults in the room have to be responsible enough to curtail this before it gets excessive. Wouldn't it be better if she went to school and went into veterinary science, where she could help animals for the rest of her life? How is she going to do that dragging around two dozen animals every time she moves?

555,"You both sound like lovely people. I would imagine that even though she loves what she's doing she's probably secretly at least a little stressed about the financial obligation and responsibility and would love the help. Cash sounds like a great idea, especially since you know she'd be responsible with it. Some other ideas in case she's not comfortable with that: You could get her large gift cards to Amazon, PetSmart, or wherever she gets most of the food and supplies. Maybe call her vet and ask if you could add a monthly ""credit"" to her account there.

A non-financial way to help out would be to research how to create a non-profit so that she could receive grant money. Funding everything herself isn't sustainable long-term and it's probably a good idea to communicate that to her and help her brainstorm funding ideas."

558,"So, you kind of have two distinct problems here. One is the emotional disconnect you're feeling because you don't really have any hobbies in common with your partner; the other is the sense of ""immaturity"" you're feeling because you feel like your partner is more forward-thinking than you are. You probably want to address those things separately, because they're not really the same - you *should* be thinking more about the future, but that doesn't mean there's anything wrong with your hobbies! 

Regarding the social part: It sounds like you're a classic extrovert and he's a classic introvert. (Remember, there's nothing wrong with either one - people sometimes say very rude things about how extroverts are immature and stupid and us introverts are the superior subspecies or whatever but those people are assholes.) The thing to do here is probably to find a middle ground. Not all the time, of course, most of the time you should feel free to do your own things, but finding some things you can do together would probably help you feel less disconnected in your partnership. Perhaps you could talk to him about inviting a few of your friends over for board games or something like that, that's more sedate/introverted but not quite as boring as grocery shopping. 

Regaring the looking-at-the-future part: you've been together for six years and you live together. Maybe it's time to start talking about what your future plans together are, and what kind of financial resources you have to attain them, and what you each plan to contribute towards mutual goals. Do you plan to get married (what sort of wedding, how soon)? Do you plan to buy a house (where, how expensive, under what constraints)? Do you plan to have kids (how many, when, how are you planning to divide childcare duties)? It makes sense that he's saving more than you are because he makes more money, but I'm sure he'd be happy to talk with you about his savings goals and how you might be able to contribute, even if only a little, which I think you should. "
559,"absolutely support this suggestion. PLEASE do this. Don't care that it's destroying his property; tollcross is correct, the deleted files can definitely be recovered.

It would probably make her happy if you acknowledged her specific efforts. For example, if she runs then talk about how her legs are so strong and beautiful from it. If her lipstick makes her lips look irresistible, let her know! "
563,"Don't drop any hints that you're moving out. Just be business as usual.

You need to secure all of your documents (birth certificate, social security card, state IDs or passports, etc.).

Make sure you have your own bank account they don't know about and are not on with you. Preferably one that is in your current location and the other location. Get e-statements so nothing is coming in the mail. You can also rent a Safe Deposit Box from the bank/credit union to put all your important stuff in, so only you have access to it.

You could get a PO Box for all your mail so they don't accidentally get something. 

Sort out your school funding so you're 100% financially independent.

Solidify your move out and make your plan of ""escape"". Then, tell them you're moving out day of (have bf and other friends there for backup). Or, better yet, move yourself out while they're out of the house.

574,"

I've had a fairly restrictive diet in the past when I was trying to lose weight/change my eating habits, and it resulted in me going through little food kicks where only one or two things sounded good to me.  Raw veggies were a safe bet because if I had an upset stomach they weren't going to make me feel gross like dairy or something heavy would, and they'd help me have a healthy poop.  Hummus was good because I knew how much a reasonable portion was calorie-wise and it was high in protein.  So, lots of times I'd go through a lot of veggies and maybe a small tub of Aldi-brand hummus in a week.  While it wasn't the absolute worst of what I could be eating, it also wasn't balanced or sustainable to eat JUST that.  So, even if I wasn't feeling it, I tried to make sure I was including other things in my diet, like healthy homemade smoothies, supplement shakes, etc.  I also took a multivitamin.

She doesn't have to have an ""eating disorder"" like anorexia or bulimia to have what is known as ""disordered eating"".  ""Disordered eating"" is an abnormal eating behavior, which may not fall into the narrowly defined boxes of a specific eating disorder like anorexia or bulimia.  Her behavior IS disordered, because it's abnormal.

Seeing a nutritionist could be really good for her regardless of what her motivation is.  If she's genuinely trying to lose weight or get healthier, a nutritionist can help her realize her behavior isn't a good way to do either of those things.  If she's eating this way because she feels like it's the only ""safe"" option for digestive reasons, then the nutritionist can point her to other things that will work in a more balanced way.  If it's a psychological issue, the nutritionist could provide a referral to mental health professionals in addition to a dietary plan.  In order to get a good nutritionist, she might need to see her general practitioner to get a referral (if she needs insurance to cover it).

Also, just because it's not impacting her physical health right now, doesn't mean it won't in the future.  You also may not be aware of health changes she's having because she may not have told you.  She obviously hasn't confided in you what the motivation is for her only veggies and hummus diet."

581,"I thought about this for a few more hours.
A thing I have personally seen more than one man do is actively flirting with a woman, only to deny doing it afterwards. And I'm not talking about him saying ""your hair looks nice today"" once, I talk about all-out touching and talking about sex, as in, his desire to have sex with you.
And after that, they got weird and defensive, claiming to never have had any interest.

I do not believe that those men are stupid in the slightest, they do it because they get away with it. It happens so often, it's become a clichee. And it's safe. If the woman flirts back: win. If she does not, then they can shift the awkwardness back to her; it's all in her head!

So, please reconsider why you believe him when he says he's only joking. There are other men out there to be friends with, men who don't get jealous about you while having a girlfriend."
582,Like I said - get a hobby. 
583,"The thing is with b), whilst it feasibly could happen, the ex has already said she has no intention of 'paying for a house she no longer lives in'. Which means I would have to pay for the new place on my own. Whilst I could do this without paying the debt off at the same time, to do it whilst paying it off at the same time would clear me out. 

This house, all bills included is £1100 a month which would leave me with c£450 after my car payment. But whilst paying a proportion of the credit card debt it would only leave me with £300 ish of which I need to get food and fuel. 

Not started seeing a divorce lawyer yet no. We do have c£30k of equity in the other house and when the appropriate time comes I intended to do an equity release of some sort so one of us (preferably me) could put a deposit down on a house which I could sustain easier. 

Whilst I can 'afford' this place, it wouldn't leave me with much disposable income "

588,"You're very sexually incompatible so why even bother with this relationship. If you have reasons to be with him besides sexuality and if those reasons are stronger than his faults, then go on. But if you're asking what you can do to make him want you more in a sexual way and respect and be excited by your sexual openness, the answer is not much. Many other men would just love your attitude. Not him.       
So what can you do, try wearing sexy clothes around the house as if just for your own enjoyment. Distance yourself from him a little. Tell him about your fantasies without sounding demanding or like you expect him to make it happen. Try this for a while and if he doesn't become more interested, consider breaking up. There is nothing more wonderful than a mutual, reciprocal relationship in which both partners love and desire each other equally. "
589,There's no real easy answer here. Your desire to want to have a social life is valid. Your boy friends feelings are valid.

Hadn't heard of this but it makes some sense. She'll try, though. Her best friend has a son who is alcoholic as well and the friend went no-contact years ago and explained alcoholism and codependency to Grandma. She really took it all into consideration for about a month before falling back into a situation with him. Sometimes she really seems to get it and will make an effort for herself and other times she falls down a drama codependency hole and takes us all with her. I guess we're all doing that naturally though. "
603,What did you do? Story time!
604,"Trying to split custody with a dog seems like a terrible idea imo. It makes the situation so awkward for new relationships. It's only been three months, it's probably better for your mental health for you to bow out now than to try to force yourself to be ok with this really awkward situation. 

My now-boyfriend and his ex had a dog. They tried to share custody for a bit, both realized it was a bad idea especially because he was having a harder time with the breakup, she eventually took the dog. If I had met him and he was trying to split custody of the dog with her, we would not be together now. That would indicate at least one of them wasn't over the breakup and was using the dog to hold onto each other.  

The way your bf responds to your concerns by telling you to get over it is concerning too. When my bf comes to me with a problem, even if I think it's a really stupid problem, I hear him out. Then we talk about it, compromise, and it's resolved. I don't just say get over it."

612,"I don't mean to sound harsh because I am sure you need support more than anything right now... but.

It's been fewer than 10 days since your last post. It is going to take a lot of time to win back trust when you have been lying to your partner for 3 years. You are barely out of detox, who knows what the long road of recovery will bring. 

As much as you wish that you didn't tell her, somewhere you know that is wrong. That is a relationship she did not consent to and it would be terrible to do that to your loved ones."
613,"Yes. Even if no charges come of it, having an official record of it will be helpful in getting a restraining order against her."
614,"&gt; I haven't told him that i'm dating someone new since he was the dumper and i didn't want him to think that i'm lying or bragging or trying to make him jealous.

Come on OP. The flipside of this is ""I haven't told him I'm dating someone new since he was the dumpee and I didn't want to kick him while he was down."" They're both wrong. Anyone you've been talking to weekly for 6mo should know you have a bf, *especially* exes. Do you regularly text anyone else who doesn't know?

Occasional texts with an ex can be fine with full disclosure and boundaries, but you haven't really had that, so yeah probs best to NC and tell him why. Say it just ""doesn't feel appropriate."" Seconding ppl who said don't be surprised if he's suddenly no longer interested in talking (because he's still into you (which means all your texting really has been inappropriate (which is the reason you *always tell your exes you have a bf*))).

That being said, there's always the hope that they have insurance, or that there's local provisions for people who can't afford that ride but need it. And if they aren't comfortable filing a report now but choose to do so later, it can be proof that this happened as they said it did.

 I am certainly not discounting her feelings.. just considering that as she has come from an upbringing where she hasn't got a proper notion of what 'love' is....and needs to be aware that wanting time for herself and grieving for the things she missed out on because she was caring for a child she didn't want is actually healthy and normal.    She needs to show philautia also. "

You boyfriend might say ""but why"" or ""how could you"" or ""what can I do to make you stay"". The response to all of this is ""this was a hard decision to make but it is the best decision. I wish you the best"". Repeat this sentence as necessary.

I firmly believe that your boyfriend is dangerous (he beats up his dog that ran away from him. Seriously what do you think he'll do to you when you break up with him). Do NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BE ALONE WITH HIM. Break up with him over the phone or in a public place. Never in his home alone just the two of you. He might want for you too meet up afterwards to discuss things. Do not meet up. The relationship is over and there's nothing to discuss. If you have things at his place that you need have a friend or even call the none emergency line for police escort. Again Do Not Be With Him Alone. The most dangerous time for people in abusive relationship is when they leave. Spend the next few nights at your friends/parents. Make sure that your place has a secure lock and let your neighbors landlord know that under no circumstances is he allowed over. Finally block him on your phone/social media/email. And scale back on social media. Turn off location and don't post your location for him. "

630,I can't say I've ever had a doctors office provide me with a pee stick instead of a blood test. Especially if I've asked for a blood test.
631,Do you not have family/friends who could help carting the kids/watching the baby?
632,"Good post, my only issue is 10. (And 3 since OP already said he stays with his parents and gives her space. In general 3 would be good as well). 

I don't think OP should contact him directly. His response would be to OP directly, which would contradict the (good) advice that he needs to go  through family/friends first. "
633,"Ugh, I've had the exact same thing happen to me except it was with my brother's group rather than my partner's group. I am a female PC gamer as well and have a great group right now. Don't know what you play but lately we've mostly been playing Overwatch and PUBG among others. Shoot me a PM if you're interested! "
634,"&gt;The masturbating made me feel very inadequate and made me a little disgusted of him.

At-least 95% of men masturbate, and a great majority of that is to porn.  You can be disgusted all you want, but most everyone does it.

&gt;For me porn is unacceptable. 

Get over it.  "
635,"I really don't have much advice to give, but I'd like to make something clear.

As per example one, your wife raped you. I'm sorry."
636,"Lmao that username is a gem. I wish I could pick mine again, I just grabbed my usual online handle! I could've been fuckymcslutstick. Hindsight 20/20."
637,It's not dude. Not in this context. It doesn't matter what type of flag you wanted to hang you can't. Those are the rules of the lease you signed. You can choose to move or accept that.
638,"Yup, OP, this ^^. 

It's not about explaining. I'm sure you have explained things well enough and that she understands what you're trying to say. 

But have you explained to her that you understand what your actions look like from HER perspective? I think the biggest mistake you made (after waiting until she got pregnant to want to do something about your feelings) was to try to downplay the results as 'meh, just what I expected.' That may have seemed respectful to you at the time, like you didn't want her to get the impression that you were really relieved because you were actually really worried, but what it looks like for anyone NOT you is that you thought it was worth putting your heavily pregnant wife through an accusation of mistrust (which, honestly, it is), perhaps judgmental looks when going for a test that's not standard at all in MEANING even though it's a piece of cake in execution, a lot of stress (which you're told as an expectant mother to avoid at all costs, which can really trigger cycles of beating yourself up for not being able to relax well enough) and all for something you didn't even see worth acknowledging beyond 'Kthxbye'. 

It's very likely that she held it together just long enough to give you a chance to mend the rift you created with your request, and then fell apart when your reaction didn't even acknowledge the sacrifice you asked of her. 

(OK, hounding her after she asked for a week to think wasn't a great idea either.) 

I actually think that paternity tests should become mandatory/standard for all pregnancies. Right now, STD tests already are in my country, even though they can bring up the 'whelp, guess someone cheated!' factor (although that can be both partners). But since they're NOT standard where you live, you can't expect to be able to treat them as such."
639,What he did was incredibly fucked up. I am kind of looking forward to an update retellung hiw your lawyer made him eat his pants here.
640,"I mean don't take any of the advice you're being given here then if you think it's not helpful, but you haven't exactly done a stellar job on managing this on your own so far, have you?

Ignore the advice, no problem, but have fun with your very certain divorce then."
641,"The line ""If you don't have anything to hide, what is there to fear?"" if ridiculous because there's no indication that OP's wife is afraid; she's insulted and outraged and for excellent reasons. "
642,"I feel like you must be projecting here. Nothing in the OP implies that they were fighting constantly. Even if they had been, this is not how adults handle ending a marriage. After his behavior, she owes him no respect. "
643,"You've gotta assume a path where you may never know why, and be ok with that. In that case, accept no guilt and take no shit."
644,"It is in how I meant it as in being pregnant. To some people the pregnancy experience is as important as the baby. I didn't think I had to explain adoption she isn't brand new to life. 

My point was to point out this guy who she keeps calling a friend is not at all worried he robbed her of an experience she has tried for, for years. So to stop defending his actions that's low for even a lot of the jerks in this thread. "
645,[removed]
646,"Yes tried, they've avoided me too and are telling others we both decided to split. People who have talked to them have just heard that they didn't know we had any issues and never heard us bickering or anything but say they can't do much. They haven't even talked to me or my family and we keep asking why!"
647,"&gt;How can I help my wife?

You do exactly as she tells you. If she needs space you give her all the space she needs. If she says she wants to separate or wants a divorce you go with it. You owe her that."
648,"That's LITERALLY all they do. They're not required to provide any medical or financial services, and most don't. They employ deceptive tactics to lure in women who are seeking abortions, bombard them with often completely false medical information about abortion procedures to try to scare or shame them out out of it, and then fail to help at all with the financial and medical burden of actually having a baby because they don't really care about any of these women they're ""helping."" "
649,"I had this happen to me as well. The exact scenario. I could only imagine if I were the wife; hell yes I want to know if my husband were diddling other women. I found his wife on Facebook and called her at work. She asked for all the gory details so she could compare his version later. It was mortifying but necessary. She deserved it. 

I found out later they divorced. She's much happier now with generous alimony. I hope she's happy!"
650,"I am on their side, actually. If you don't pay rent for the home, then you need to wear a bra. Their house, their rules."
651,"Yeah that's what I'm thinking he'll do as well, claim coincidence. It's been too much of a pattern, though. She's kinda a drama queen. In one of the other comments I noted he has a _really_ hard time saying no to people, which has been another issue in our relationship, unless it directly affects, well, our relationship. "
652,"I would be in the dump the person camp. Grief is terrible and I empathize with what she is going through but that doesn't give her a free pass to step out of a serious relationship. 

Consider how you are going to feel about this 10 years down the line. Resentful? Jealous? angry? 

You can cut your losses now and find someone else while you're young or drag things out to what might be a potentially terrible relationship. 

"
653,"I didn't realise OP was in the US. 

There's no such thing in the UK or Australia to my knowledge. I suspect many other countries would be similar."
654,"Not only is OP ""avoiding punishment"" (good catch there! I didn't see that.) She is also the one to make the situation ""a problem"". 

R was a shit-lord. But that's just R being R, no biggy. And then there is OP, who refuses to accept that. She refuses it so much that she's going away. Her behaviour is escalating the situation from ""that's life"" to ""maybe there is a problem"", but instead of putting the blame on R, it's so SO much easier to put it on OP. 

I think that's why BF is so weird about it. The ""problem"" would go away, if only OP would stop reacting to it. But she does not. So, in his mind, she's causing the weird feelings. 

Also, if she's willing to walk away from shit, she may walk away from him some day, which can be scary for a partner who's willing to do shitty things."
655,"Ok so he was doing something you liked, but you're calling that groping and blew up at him because of it? Honestly, just ditch him for both of your sakes."
656,"This seems like a red flag to me. It all sounds very controlling. If I were you, I'd tell him that I will get all the testing done on my own and let him know if there are any problems. Him being present during gynecological exams etc. seems like a bit much. Does he trust you? Does he think you wouldn't actually go to the doctor once you'd agreed to, or does he think you'd lie about the results? What does that say about him? Usually if someone assumes others are prone to lying or not keeping their word, it's because that person does those things so they think dishonesty is normal, as if everybody does it.

Try telling him that you'll go to the doctors, but you'll do it on your own and you'll tell him if they find anything that you think he needs to know. Then pay close attention to how he reacts."
657,"Sure, your parents will miss you, but no loving parent would want their daughter to sacrifice her own career and opportunities to spend a little more time with them. They helped you when you needed it so you could recover and have your own wonderful life. Quality of time matters, not the quantity."
658,"OP, based on what else you've said in your post and in your comments, I don't think that this is simply a matter of your mom being bigoted and unable to accept or understand your identity. Your mom sounds like a generally abusive and unloving person. You've said that she always seemed to favor your brothers over you, that she's been hyper-critical of you since you were ten, and that she also has your dad and your husband walking on eggshells around. Additionally, she's done some deliberately spiteful things to you since you came out. Her actions at the wedding were particularly cruel. I don't think that this is about her ""just"" being super-transphobic--she'd have probably just cut you off by now if that were the case. I also don't think that this is about her being an older person who has trouble understanding transgender issues. If it were, she'd likely have at least tried to accept your identity and at least avoided deliberate slights, like insisting on deadnaming you and trying to turn your gay wedding between two men into a straight wedding. I think that she's a generally abusive person who's also anti-trans, and she's using your gender identity as a stick to beat you with because she likes abusing people and you're a favorite scapegoat who happens to have given her a particularly powerful tool to use against you. I say just cut her off. "
659,"This OP. People like this don't change, especially with you taking care of him. It took me way too long to leave someone like this and the amount of relief was undescribable"
660,"Am I the only one here who doesn't see anything wrong with jerking off next to your SO in bed, especially if they didn't want to have sex? My ex did it on several occasions. I gave zero fucks. And some of those times where sex wasn't happening despite my interest because of mother nature, I was even inclined to watch or help out.

Honestly, who the fuck says they feel violated and sick because their boyfriend whacked off in bed next to them?

Your GF is being entirely unreasonable and is acting like a small child. I'm curious, though- if she reacts that badly to this, how does she react any other time you masturbate? I know there are women out there who can't seem to deal with the fact that their SO has needs.

Is this the kind of person you want to deal with for the rest of your life? If I was with a man who reacted in a similar way, that'd be a major red flag to me. Her reaction is just so extreme that I have trouble not thinking that this kind of behavior bleeds into other areas of your relationship. This is not how a rational, mentally healthy human being responds to things."
661,I don't think you're going to get a lot of sympathy here.
662,What if you meet your mom somewhere in the middle-ish? I have heard good things about Iceland and there is alwyas western Europe. This cuts down on travel time for you and still lets you see your mom?
663,"You might want to look at more progressive Christian resources on the issue, then. May be especially important for your husband. 

In any case, father supportive resources around you. You can't have the life you thought you had or wanted. You're going to have to grieve and process that."
664,"Um.. you're only objecting to chipping in to pay for decorations??

I wouldn't attend this wedding. I don't want to spend my time, money, and effort appeasing selfish entitled people! I'd sent my regret and purchase a gift. That's it.

####Ask yourself, why are you tying yourself into knots for these ungrateful assholes?

Seriously. Figure it out. Only you can decide if you want them to continue walking all over you or not.."
665,"As a sarcastic person I LOVE this. Concerned it will be lost on OP, but love it."
666,"This was my neighbor's mom. She was obsessed with being thin and would lecture both my friend and me. We were both good weights and were healthy kids who got out to play a lot. She would force me to get on the scale, so she could brag about her daughter weighed less than me, even though she was a couple of inches shorter. I never told my mom. I pretty much rolled my eyes and laughed at her about it. "
667,"Several questions. 

When your parents divorced, did you notice a sudden change in your parents treatment of your brother? 

Did he become the figurative 'black sheep'? 

Were you suddenly treated better or at least differently than your brother?

Do you know why your parents divorced? "
668,So believe him. Why do you not trust your boyfriend on this?
669,"You're putting him in a no-win situation. If he says ""no"" you think he's lying, and if he says ""yes"" you think you're not good enough for him and/or he's going to stray/cheat.

Just stop asking."
670,There is also the possibility of having your roommate buy some of the furniture from you. Personally I would get new furniture and move as little stuff as possible. 
671,My husband won't stop either. It's drives me insane and when we are in the car together I physically take his phone away and throw it in the backseat. 
672,"Your issue is that you want your controlling parents to accept your significant other, right ?  Unfortunately it isn't always an easy/quick thing to happen and they will just need to trust your choice of partner. Your parents are looking out for you and can give advice, but they need to realize that you are an adult free to make your own choices."
673,"In that case do they have a wedding registry? If yes, get them something reasonable from that. If no, get them a gift card for a movie at the theatre, or a nice ish restaurant.   "
674,"I'm not into BDSM, but it looks like you both could use (and should have before it escalated) to do more research or reading on what folks do to make it work. For how well you two communicate, it seems like there's some feelings not being communicated, or something missing from talking through this situation that has killed your sex life."
675,"I don't know. For me the ""basics"" of being an observant Jew is questioning everything. Not believing ""in God, in the flood, in the Jews being the chosen people, etc."" is totally in line with the practice of Judaism. "
676,"&gt; That's not true its hard for her to change her routine and it will take work, it is not impossible. The impossible part comes in because she doesn't want to change.

Further on this, the wife has clearly shown that changing her routing is actually quite easy for her. She does it every time here boss gives her an extension on her work start time. Instead of keeping the same exact routine, and getting to work on time, she pushes her routine up. "
677,Google Werner Herzog's recent documentary on texting and driving. It is a short PSA-style film with a few interviews with victims AND also drivers who caused accidents that killed people. It's really harrowing. Make your boyfriend watch it. 
678,"&gt;  for me money is one thing and people is another thing

That is exactly what /u/paralyzedbyindecisio said. OP is saying that money &gt; people (family). These people aren't asking for OP to fund their vacation to Europe. They are sick and they need help staying afloat."
679,Lol I wonder if the sister will put a cover charge on the wedding...
680,"He should certainly clean more while he cooks (though I maintain that unloading the dishwasher should be part of ""dishes,"" not ""cooking""), but....

I like to cook, but it doesn't mean  cooking every meal, every day is fulfilling some passion and there's nothing else I'd rather be doing, ever. It's still a chore, and it's a huge leap to hear ""he likes cooking"" and turn that into ""he finds it a creative and fulfilling hobby with no chore component"" and compare it to hobby-painting a landscape (that you presumably did when you felt like it, not every single day regardless of if you wanted to). 

This line of thinking is why I had to hide that I enjoy cooking from roommates and from friends I was on trips with. It always turns into ""But you LIKE cooking, why can't you just make me breakfast, too?"" ""Can't you just make extra for me? I thought you said you enjoy cooking!"" I do. And yet, it's still a chore. It's still labor. 

Take your landscape example. You know how people who become professional artists who are obligated to produce art all the time on a schedule rightfully get irritated when people act like they're just playing all day because they enjoy art? Same phenomenon. Chore division should certainly take enjoyment into account, but it's ridiculous to pretend it's the same as a fun-time passion hobby that you spend some time on when you feel like it.        "
681,"I would stop trying to determine whether ""lesbian"" describes your wife.

The issue here is the lack of attraction and (possible) infidelity.   Couples counselling?"
682,"Your cat needs to be rehomed as soon as you are able. Don't be irresponsible with your Cat. Sometimes people volunteer for things that they are unable to do. Recognise that this is one of those cases and accept that.

683,[deleted]
684,"&gt;The fact that he loves to cook will not only save you money in the long run, it also means you get good meals, and a man with a hobby is means that he is going to be happy, and busy (less time on his hands to cheat).

Leaving aside the sexist hot-mess portion of your comment that a busy man won't cheat, he can keep busy too by cleaning up his own fucking mess as he cooks.

Also, I have a friend whose husband LOVES to cook, and holy shit he spends a shitload of money on ingredients. Enough that often the meal costs more than if we'd gone to a restaurant. It's damn good, but buying specialty perishable ingredients is pricey since unlike a restaurant you can't buy in bulk."
685,How much is she charging your mom to be mother of the bride?  And your dad to give her away?  Ask your mom that and see if she starts feeling any differently? Otherwise no way would I entertain this nonsense. How embarrassing .
686,"If everyone can see what the others are bidding, I assure you that a bid of only $1 from the bride's sister would send a much stronger message than not bidding at all."
687,"i think you guys are doing a great job of being communicative! it's super good that he told you how he felt, and that you are able to see things from his perspective.     
    
maybe you could possibly invite him to one of the readings or shoots? i feel like people don't understand how professionalism works on set until they see it- perhaps if he sees how you and your ""on-screen lover"" are actually *working* then he will kind of understand how it's acting, not the real deal."
688,She's getting married in just over a month too. All that shit is gonna have to be rush ordered = $$$
689,I'd start selling copies of the video of this insanity. I'd pay for it so hard. I'm dying to see the outcome of this circus. 
690,OP says her sister doesn't even need the money though. I think the evil genius part is more about her treating other people like they are her toys.
691,"Most of the men in my life aren't like that at all. And it's because I've stopped associating with men that are. But you know what? Somehow there's still plenty of men in my life. They're just loving, respectful men.

It drives me crazy when men like your husband go on about ""boys will be boys/locker room talk/banter"" when I KNOW tons of men who do not behave that way and are disgusted to have that pinned on their gender."
692,"&gt;  but she was in a relationship where she was being cheated on... 

Or so she says. Sounds like another excuse. 

Even if it were true, the normal response to being cheated on is simply to break up, as I hope you're about to do. "
693,"It easily can. My wife used to do this. Every dinner WL she used every dish, all sorts of ingredients everywhere, sink filled with dishes and wrappers and food waste. Counters covered on flour, etc. It's like, thanks, but I'd prefer a hamburger and some actual downtime in my evening. "
694,"Oh, come on. If you had a relative you hadn't spoken to in ten years and all of a sudden they hit you up for money, you would be a fool to write that check. Just because you're related to someone doesn't mean you can treat them like shit."
695,"The time to discuss these issues was throughout the relationship. If this is something you've brought up time and time again without improvement on her end, it would be no surprise and appropriate to point out that this unresolved issue is the reason you're breaking up.

If, for some weird reason, you've been pretending everything is fine this whole time (sound like anyone you know?), then keep your mouth shut. If you really wanted to help her with this issue, you would have tried already. Dumping on her at this point would just be to make yourself feel better. Accept your part in the failure of this relationship via poor communication, and resolve to improve *yourself* for next time."

697,"I'll play devil's advocate on the assumption these people aren't utter monsters.

But how bad was the situation with Mike? How much do they know?

From your post, we know he's shy. But the issue is, I know many mothers with ""shy"" kids who run and scream and hit. Many mothers are not really honest about the temperment of their kids, so I would get why your friends would take what you said with a grain of salt.

But how bad was the situation? I think it depends on how much they know and how bad it was. I would get being cautious under some conditions until you were sure there was no hidden explosive behavior or something. 

I think maybe if they're good friends, ask if they would mind babysitting with you while you pay for a sitter for them? That way they can see he's just quiet and shy and possibly change their minds from whatever preconceived notions they have.

If they utterly refuse, well...full of shit now, weren't they? :/ With that ""need any help"" thing.

698,"To be fair, most people in the US graduate after they've been 18 for at least a few months so it sounds like holding her back just got her back to grade level.

If that was me, I would feel so overwhelmed. Your academic standing at the university you are both involved in would make me feel like a failure. 

She might be having a really rough time, OP. Maybe you could suggest some counselling sessions, some just for her and maybe some for both of you. It's good to talk to someone you have no obligation to, it's very liberating. "
702,"&gt; If she starts crying I honestly think it's make or break because she is either willing to work through these things because she love's you too

That's not really fair to her. He shouldn't be expecting her to drastically change herself for him. I mean, even her facial features repulses him, what is she supposed to do about that? 

Plus, what does the conversation even look like? When it comes down to it, he's basically saying ""everything about your body and face grosses me out and the sex is awful."" This isn't a communication issue, it's a compatibility one."

It really, really sounds like he cheated. I'd even be willing to stop at ""felt shady spending time with Rachel,"" but it honestly sounds like he just straight up cheated. 

Please keep us updated, OP. I hope you're okay. This is all so sad. "
705,"What, exactly is this guy adding to your life? "
706,"Confront your gf. Yeah you snooped, but you also found out that your gf lied to you and cheated on you. Also, it sounds like she never planned on telling you. This is a huge betrayal on her part and I think it's going to take a lot of work to trust this woman again (if it's even possible). "
707,"Your husband does not like having it. He gets a say in this decision as well. People here are just trying to show you the outside perspective.

710,Your husband has no reason to apologize. You just want to blame him for disrupting the peace when it has been your BIL all along! Why is your husband considered childish but your BIL gets to be stubborn?

Finally got so nutty an officer decided he needed to sleep it off in jail. That was his turning point. But overall, throughout the years he's gotten more logical. 

I think maybe he just hates me now, and since I'm his girlfriend, he can talk to me however he wants. I keep asking if he wants to break up with me and he say's no! I said I wanted to break up a few months ago actually and he cried as was like ""no I'll never find anyone else"" and I decided to stay. I feel like I'm such a shitty person to be around, it must be awful to be him...but I admit I never feel like that when I'm around other people or by myself. I like me. I think other people like me. He doesn't seem to be one of them anymore. I don't understand why...if that's the case...he won't just leave. Which is why I made this post, because maybe I am getting defensive and I am a shitty logic person and maybe that really does suck to deal with? 

But Reddit seems to agree...I'm not awful so far..."
714,"Correct--asexuality is not the same as impotence, or even necessarily a lack of libido. It's a lack of sexual attraction. It's just like how a straight person isn't sexually attracted to the same gender, only the ace person isn't sexually attracted to anyone at all. "

719,"This is going to be a rough time for you and your grandkids. They know their dad sucks as a father and they know you're trying to reach out to them. Thank you for caring about them and proving there is a stable constant in their lives. Your son sounds like a lose cannon; ready to live life but not ready to commit as a parent. 

Because you took care of them previously, if you were to involve CPS or whichever relevant organization, you would most likely be awarded custody of them after an investigation, especially if your son is drug tested. 

You do need to get an attorney and if you're stretched for money then seek out pro bono services. 

Depending on your regional laws, having any record of communication between you and him need to be kept safe and have copies made of for prep work to go to court.

You will have to fight your son in court. Rarely do grandparents receive custody or rights, and only in instances when a parent is failing their children. 

Document everything and possibly have your son's girlfriend write a letter detailing her experience with your son and his children. Make sure it goes to your attorney. 

Read up on your local laws and prepare yourself for the possibility the courts might not side with you due to your age and/or current living situation (if you can't move well or require daily care). 

Edit: more stuff."

725,"Breaking things when you're angry, as you've already realised, is not helpful. 

How would you feel about therapy? It sounds like your childhood was difficult, and therapy might help you unpick that. 

Expressing anger by hitting things or shouting leads to more anger. Taking deep breaths and calming down, then talking about what's going on, can help. 

There is a theory that anger is a secondary emotion - it happens to help us deal with/hide from an emotion we can't cope with. Too much fear? Get angry instead. Overwhelmed by shame? Anger!"

728,"I have, and they have done all they can but it doesn't work. It has gotten worse and not better. Both myself and the owners are afraid of what may happen if I leave as she can have very long tantrums where she hurts herself at times- and I don't want that to happen."

734,"So, he's not cruel to *all* animals, he's only cruel to *your* animal.

He's not unkind and disrespectful to *all* people, he's only unkind and disrespectful to *you*.

OP I'm not seeing the silver lining here."
735,He could. Or works in a medium which may expose him to the virus.
736,"Oh god that is so sad! I hope the poor thing is okay now :(

People who abuse animals are such assholes and cowards. How pathetic can you be, that you have to abuse living beings that are clearly weaker than you? This makes me so angry. 

I knew a guy who would put his cat in the freezer and laugh it off, claiming that he loved it. The cat was clearly distressed and ended up running away a couple days later. I wasn't around when any of this happened, because I probably would have lost it. I have absolutely no respect for people who abuse animals.

Animals are amazing and deserve all the love."
737,Blocking her would have been enough explanation. You shouldn't even care to explain anything to a woman who was a nobody to you. Please take full responsibility for every part of this before you even start to think about asking for forgiveness.
738,"Well, you cheated, but you didn't lie about it. In the eyes of many, honesty is more important than loyalty, so even though he now has reason to question your loyalty your he can still trust you to be honest with him.

With that in mind, it makes perfect sense for him to process this by asking questions about the status of your relationship. He believes that you will answer truthfully, so when you said that you love him, and cried about this being a mistake, I'm sure he made up his mind to believe and forgive. 

The open relationship question probably stems from him trying to understand why you cheated in the first place, so perhaps once you've thought about your answer, ask him if an open relationship is something he'd be interested in/comfortable with. He might've suggested it to allow you some additional freedom in the relationship while he keeps your heart, if you see what I mean."
739,"I expect OP to act on his awareness that she was ""trying too hard"" not with annoyance, not by searching for consensus behind her back, but by up front communication and concern for her interests. 
 He doesn't have to be a mind reader to be a good boyfriend and ask her questions about herself.

Although... OP, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that you did that.  Nothing in your post really indicates that you weren't trying to pull your weight in the relationship."

741,"I realize an hour sounds ridiculous, but you would have to see the mess to believe it.

I think I mentioned in the post that he'll drop food on the ground and leave it. We eat rice a lot and this happens about 4-5 times a week. He'll leave dropped rice on the ground from making sushi, accidentally step on it and track it all over the kitchen.

The actual cooking space isn't huge, but the tile floor connected to that is pretty large and he goes from the kitchen to the outside (to grill) making a disgusting sticky mess of he floor. 

So 4-5 times a week the mess is so bad mopping the whole kitchen, which is about 50% of the house excluding bedrooms and bathrooms, needs to be mopped.

This is on top of unloading the dishwasher, loading almost a dishwasher full of dishes, hand washing 5+ pots/pan and a ton of other stuff too large for the dishwasher, cleaning off all the seasonings/condiments (he leaves spills all over them) before putting them away, putting EVERY. SINGLE. THING.used during the cooking process away, dealing with spills on any and every surface of the kitchen, cleaning up grease messes, organizing and putting away left overs, etc. 


We have a roommate and my boyfriend loves having friends over. Often times he is making these meals for 5+ people. "
742,"Look, if you want to condemn yourself with a cheater, that's up to you. As most other people in this thread are telling you, this is a sign of two things:  
1. You're afraid of not having her.  
2. You don't have enough respect for yourself.  "
743,"Yikes, I don't think you should be giving relationship advice when you're unable to control yourself from fighting people after waking up as if that's the most traumatic experience ever. And it is absolutely relevant that she was in pain, you seem to desperately trying to justify her boyfriend's abuse."
744,"&gt; Helping chip in for the SOs moms sister and kid? Pretty sure most couples would say ""yeahhhh... i don't know about that"" to.

745,"wow... I have no words except for I'm sorry people in this world are shitty horrible trashy people. And I know you used to love her, but that's exactly what she is. I'm trying to be ""respectful"" per the rules, but she's being the complete opposite. 

Get a lawyer, take EVERYTHING she owns and put it on the steps, and let ur lawyer divy up everything else you two may own. If you go taking things you both got together, she can use that against you. 

Make a list of EVERYTHING. Most people forget the little things, but they all add up and before you know it a bunch of little crap means she gets the car, or the truck.. etc. 

Be careful, try and stay level headed, and please please, move on to someone that will appreciate you and take care of that beautiful little daughter of yours. "

757,"I think it's very difficult for LL people to understand HL people.


In a monogamous relationship, sexuality is something you share with the one person you chose. You chose that person because they're your favorite. You want to know and be known by this person.


Sex is literally the **one** activity that you don't do with anyone else. It is exclusive to the relationship in a way that no other activity is.


Sex is also one of the most vulnerable, intimate, and (literally) loving activities you share with your partner. That's why it's exclusive, because it means so very much in that context. It is a crucial building block for a HL.


I think you're really trivializing rejection by calling it ""one issue"". Think of it this way: if she cheated on you by going out and having sex with someone else, it wouldn't be so much about the sex, would it? It would be able the betrayal, the lies, and the lack of faithfulness. This one issue is about the lack of a crucial bonding experience between partners.


You might find the best house in the world, but if it didn't have a bathroom, all the other compatible stuff wouldn't matter much, would it? "
758,"Dude, you are in some serious denial. "
759,"It sounds like he didn't reply at all, potentially for a day or more.  I'd say that's a problem.  I prefer to be pretty low-contact, the expectation to reply instantly to texts is annoying to me, but if he was ""out of town"" for more than a day trip and didn't reply at all that's an issue."
760,His mother is hurting him by not allowing him to save. He won't be able to make any big purchases because he will have no savings.
761,"&gt; They do try, honestly- but they don't know what to do.

&gt; She's their little girl and they cave when she wants it back

They absolutely know what to do. They just choose not to."
762,"No, I'm pointing out that she has skin in the game and people telling her to just leave the dogs are not thinking it through (also, as a dogowner I don't like that idea for the dogs' sake). Elsewhere I advised she contact the bf's mother &amp; ask for the vax records so the dogs can go in a kennel. 

You can't say, as you did, that 

&gt; Whatever happens after that is HIS fault and HIS problem

realistically when her stuff gets wrecked and she's also on the hook for damage done to the apartment. "
763,"&gt; I guess I'm just curious as to what ""out of respect for my mother/sisters means""

You and I both. He can't give me an exact answer. "
764,"How good is she with technology? If you blocked her number could you just say ""Oh no! I don't know why the texts aren't going through anymore. That's so weird, it must be that same phone update that activated the fingerprint lock on my phone.""

I have no idea of lying is actually a good idea in this case because I don't have much experience working with developmentally disabled people. Is this something where if every time she tries for a couple weeks she'll move on or do you think it would be a constant issue? 
"
765,"(Before reading) Yes, because you don't justification to break up with someone. 

(After reading) Still yes, for the first reason, plus it seems like he's lying. "

More likely to cause competition between you two. If only one runner is aware of the race it stops being a race and becomes a jog."
769,"I have a feeling that you're not dating the right people yet. How are you finding people to date? Dating apps? Local groups? Hobbies? Through friends and coworkers? 

You say you're an open book if they ask but do you actively put yourself out there for them to get to know you? Do you actively try to get to know your partner? If you present your genuine self to others, you are more likely to find those who do the same, and will make finding someone you ate emotionally compatible with easier. "
770,"Wait a second. You are waiting for him to propose before you invest more into the relationship?

This is backwards thinking. Maybe you should act like someone he would want to propose to and he might propose to you. 

Why would he think that things will get better after he proposes? If I was him I would just assume things would get worse."
771,"It doesn't matter what other animals do, because other animals have all sorts of different mating customs. Is it natural to eat your mate after you've finished having sex? Yeah, for some species, but we're humans and that's not our bag.

This line he's feeding you about monogamy is manipulative bullshit to make you stop trusting your own opinions and feelings. Plenty of people are perfectly happy being in monogamous relationships - I mean, you have no desire to open the relationship up, right? You're not abnormal. Many, many people share the desire for a monogamous relationship with you."
772,Have you tried to speak to his family? It's possible that he's lied to them too. They might have better luck getting answers than you.
773,"&gt; I was asked to not bring her if she's going to be ""like that"" with people

""Like what? Can you explain what you mean?""

Lol I'm pretty envious of Rachel's skill to be so smooth."
774,Exactly. She said they were pregnant and living together within 6 months of knowing each other. That is extremely quick and they probably knew very little about each other. Not shocking they ended up breaking up. It sounds like he stayed with her because he felt he had to. Without the pregnancy they probably would not have lasted long. 
775,"You seem incredible selfish.


Not because you are following your dream, but because you preventing your ex (who seems to really like you) from moving on with your constant back and forth game.


If you trully love this guy, please release him from your manipulative games and let him find happiness elsewhere."
776,[deleted]
777,"Well, to start, I agree with you. That sounds suffocating tbh, and I know I couldn't handle it. 

It sounds like you guys haven't really figured out boundaries and what it is that each of you needs in a relationship. Have you guys thought about talking about specific times that you are apart? For example: ""Honey, when I get home from work, give me at least a half-hour before you talk to me so I can decompress."" As well as: ""Honey, I need you to refrain from contacting me throughout the day. Pretend we live in the 80's."" And: ""Honey, a few times a month I need a day to myself, please."" etc, etc, etc. Then, he can explain what he needs from you, and you two can come up with solutions that he can work with regarding physical affection and intimacy. 

Just a thought."
778,"He honestly doesn't do much in my opinion.  I've pointed it out and he gets defensive because he feels that he has done a lot to help out that I 'don't see'.  I would be more worried if he was wanting me to pay rent and not doing anything at all, otherwise, I figure it's his money and his time, he can live how he wants."
779,"Addressing the hitting.  Talk to the owners and give them two options:

1) Anytime she hits you, your shift is immediately over.  Take your keys and bag and go home.  They will pay you for the full day.

2) Anytime she hits you, you will call the police.

Their choice."
780,"I think you should break up with her. She deserves somebody who appreciates the fact that she is well-rounded and excels at a lot of things, not somebody who resents her for it because he's immature and can't get over himself.

You don't deserve her."
781,Yeah its such a good Idea to tie yourself legally (and financially) to a person who has just cheated on you and not been upfront About it. A divorce is not at all expensive. /s 
782,"When I first started dating my fiancee, I was terrified about privacy. I hid everything. Hobbies, things I liked, anything personal, anything that...well, I was used to hiding. At first she was a little pissed because it felt like I didn't trust her. Meanwhile, I was terrified and upset because it felt completely rational that I Couldn't Let Her See ___ Or She'd Realize I Was Actually A ____ Person. Shit like poetry I wrote five years ago or feelings I had that I didn't tell her about.

It took a long time and a lot of work to be able to accept - oh, I don't have to do that now. And when she says ""wow this house is dirty"", it doesn't mean ""wow you're a disgusting slob and I'm about to blow up/look down on you because I'm so disgusted"", it means...the house is dirty so we should clean it.

I relate a lot too. And that sounds like a nightmare - I'm glad your boss was just letting you know in passing. Texting is hard, too, so much tone gets lost and reduced to one line of letters lol and with professional stuff, it's not like they're going to throw in emojis to fill the cracks."
783,"This is just a possibility but even though your relationship seems to rely on texting, since you don't see each other often, he could just not like texting. I know some people who just don't like having long, delayed conversations back and forth via text especially when they're home doing other stuff. It feels like multitasking. I understand it hurts since it's one of the only ways to interact with him and he really should make that effort considering your guy's situation and it means a lot to you. "
784,What? It is not weird or creepy to have your father as a guest in your home. I would say it's thoughtful to give your guest your room and take the couch. You guys are fine. Your friends do sound rude and unkind. 
785,"In light of NewDriverShrew's comment, I want to say something that might come off as kind of harsh.

My ex didn't drive, basically for the reasons you've given. I CAN'T drive because I have a vision impairment, so of the two of us, he was always going to be the only one who could provide the lifestyle benefits that come with driving. It was kind of maddening, therefore, that he wasn't willing to prioritise getting lessons. He tended to say that finding the right teacher was hard, that the process made him nervous, and that he didn't want to fail. I had seen him drive very well multiple times but he would always say that he didn't quite feel comfortable to take the test.

These things were all true and his avoidance was still driving me mental, because ultimately none of those factors were going anywhere and he had no plan that could have addressed them, which ultimately meant that his plan was to do nothing. By the end of a 7 year relationship (we broke up for other reasons) during which his learners permit expired - he had had it for ten years - I absolutely sounded impatient and harsh about this issue, because he wouldn't admit that ultimately he just didn't care about driving enough to make the choice to feel the fear and do it anyway. I worry that I'm projecting on you, but your comment that you don't know if there are any driving schools for adults near you, when someone easily googled and found them in a second, makes me concerned that you kind of know you're avoiding something that will ultimately be scary and using other excuses to avoid acknowledging that core fact about this situation. Sometimes you need to be afraid of failure, deeply afraid, and do it anyway. If you have found yourself avoiding other things due to anxiety, then maybe the anxiety is the problem, not the driving."

788,"If you want to be nice about it you can call the brother and let him know that while you appreciate him reaching out, it would be too traumatic for a 6 year old to go to a funeral of a dad that he never knew. Tell him that you need some time to talk to a child psychologist to figure out the best way to tell your son. Ask him if he wants the kid to get to know his grandparents. If yes, then actually go to a child therapist and figure out a good way of setting that up. But you certainly don't need to do this all RIGHT THIS INSTANT. If your ex's brother is a reasonable person, he'll understand. If he's grieving and lashes out at you, don't take it personally.

And if you don't want a relationship with these people, it's ok to say no. Just sort of fade out and don't make any dramatic pronouncements."
789,This sounds like a really healthy and loving relationship that you should definitely stay in because you sound really happy. 
790,"Since the hawaii trip sounds like a full family gathering, are these your parents's trips, or are these full family trips?

If these are full family trips (as in it's not your mom inviting specific people but the whole family deciding to get together), **reach out to the rest of your family and see if you can find out if your mom and stepdad have told the family anything about you not going. it might be the rest of the family assumed you were invited/wanted you to come, but your mom/stepdad are LYING about whether you want to come (""oh we asked her but she said no - she wants to spend time with her college friends"" etc.)**

Your mom might not want a relationship with you, but **as an ""independent"" member of the family (her words), you should interact directly with the rest of your family. THEY might invite you, and then your mom and stepdad can deal with their pissy attitude without the luxury of hiding their cruelty and exclusion to the rest of the family.**"

792,"OP, don't do this. She lost the weight for herself. Comments like this would be very destructive."
793,Don't worry about it. Reddit has this giant boner for polyamory and recommends it everytime someone says they think they may cheat in a relationship. It works for that. 0001% of people but most people in monogamous relationships wouldn't change to it and stay together.

798,"&gt;A relationship requires two people. Both people must have their needs met. I don't blame you for cheating when your SO had already given up on your relationship and your well-being

802,"My ex-husband and I discussed having kids before we married too. We agreed on three--I thought three was good because I had three names I really liked. Fantastic reason, I know. Where I grew up, *everyone* followed the ""life script""--graduate, go to college/military, get married, have kids, rinse and repeat. I didn't question it. So I got married.

Then I had a pregnancy scare. I wasn't pregnant, thank God, because the scare forced me to realize the future is now, and I could become pregnant. I felt incredibly trapped to the point of becoming suicidal, and after quite a bit of soul searching, I realized kids are a choice, and not a requirement. Anyways, long story short, we divorced over it. It was the best thing to happen to me, but still incredibly painful. My ex and I had those same conversations, and I recognize a lot of things your husband is saying, because I said them too.

You need to sit down and suss out whether or not he actually wants kids. I recommend encouraging him to speak with a therapist. Every kid should be wanted by both parents, and he, through no fault of his own, may not be able to provide that. "

While this is being addressed, you should tell him that the way your walking disrupts him, his playing of football against your shared wall, singing, and hanging with friends is equally as disruptive to you. Perhaps come up with a designated ""quiet time,"" say from 9pm-7am or what have you. Bouncing a ball against your shared wall is never acceptable when you're home, let alone EVER if you live in an apartment building with multiple tenants. He needs to get some self-awareness FFS. "
810,"This is more of a personal view issue. This is completely about if you view the glass half full or empty.

I've fallen in love with not just this person, but the very specific experiences and beliefs this person has. Ya there might be someone out there who has close, but not this exact formula.

Yeah, this is a problem on your end. 'Going along with it for a few days' is accepting the plans. You were given ample room to say something and didn't- in your own words, you went along with it.

Why do you take stuff that happens (losing headphones, having a train delay) and make them into big events?  Worse, you blame your partner for things he can't control while on a trip (train delay) - isn't the whole point of a trip the adventure, not knowing what to expect?

It kind of sounds like you have a habit of piling on anger / resentment / passive aggression (silent treatment - over headphones that *aren't even yours?!*) when a situation is not ideal.  Not a great trait.

Sorry, but I wouldn't respect this in my partner either.  The way you describe yourself behaving would make me ""moody"" too.  You are also very disrespectful towards him.  Not everything in life goes exactly as planned, and when it doesn't - it doesn't always mean it's someone's fault.  You have some maturing  / growth to do."

Did you discuss the two job thing at all? You saying I'm sacrificing is ignoring that you've basically handed off childcare to her full time. She now has two full time jobs as well. You've got two jobs, who's going to get the call for emergencies and have to leave work? Who's going to be dealing with all the doctors appointments?  

&gt;Ultimately I think I'm just going to have to open the communication

If you made the choice to work two jobs without much discussion or buy in from the two of you. You're the one that closed down the lines of communication. 

When your saying things like I've sacrificed in a relationship, you're heading towards an entitled attitude. "
