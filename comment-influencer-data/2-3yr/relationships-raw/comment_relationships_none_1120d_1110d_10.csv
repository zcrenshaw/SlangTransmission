0,"I also think that your being down voted is a bit ridiculous. You could be right; all of this makes sense and is a great perspective to consider.

But I personally think that sometimes, people are as fucked up as they seem, and this situation should be treated with extreme caution. Explaining away Serena's very messed-up, insulting, and isolating actions could open OP's brother up to abuse that people don't care to look for and therefore don't see before terrible things happen. 

OP should treat Serena as his brother's abuser, and thus treat her with caution. She sounds unhinged, and regardless of the possible understandable reasons for being this way, she could also be dangerous. Not necessarily ""stabby"" dangerous, but she could seriously ruin OP's marriage and relationship with his brother. "
1,"Exactly. She needs a doctor's appointment asap, pregnancy with an IUD is very dangerous, and she needs the IUD out if she's thinking of having the kid - the doc may want to take it out regardless since its failed to do its job. "
2,[deleted]
3,Why the fuck would she tell OP that? I don't understand this at all.

5,"You are trying to convince yourself of ways to stay so you can keep being in denial despite her abuse. Change is scary, even when it's a good change. 

You've been married to her for twenty years and so some part of you has become accustomed to the chaos and abuse and the adrenaline high you get from all that anger and fear.

You are *only* 50. Do you want to spend another forty years with her like this? Or even one year? 

You know what you need to do. You're just stalling.  "

7,"Whole fruit also has a shit ton of fiber, so your body absorbs it slowly - you don't get the insulin spike with fruit the same way you do with candy. Also, tons of micronutrients. It's absolutely possible to overdo it on fruits, and shoving yourself full of fruit is NOT the same as shoving yourself full of veggies, but they arent just empty calories like a chocolate bar."
8,"It's been a couple years, but yeah that was exactly what had happened. When she clicked on the name it brought up a demographics screen and a visit date and apparently that was the issue. Pretty sure it was handled completely internally but going back and reviewing her key strokes leading up to the event was part of the investigation. 

Edit: her sister has a really generic name like ""Jill Jones"" so she didn't know for sure it was her until the demographics screen showing her address and date of birth showed up. "
9,"I'm pregnant too so I feel you. First off, people that insinuate that shit to you and your husband? They are actually revealing a very shallow and sad aspect of their personalities. Seems like your husband knows this! Yes, it would lovely to be a beautiful supermodel, but many of them have shitty personalities. Your husband knows this too. 

Second, I would just make a really mean joke back to them because hey, I'm pregnant and bitchy right now! Something like ""I'm so sorry to underwhelm you, but nice to meet you! Who is your plastic surgeon?"" with a smirk. I mean, just fucking own it. Make fun of it.  ""Yes, I'm the terrible half! Yoir face says it all! Have you ever tried Botox? Great stuff."" It's called ""negging."" You give an insecure but good looking girl a compliment that can be taken negatively, google it. 

Congrats on your pregnancy!! Hang in there!

"
10,Good news is NOT a snow balls chance in the hell the court would let him see his kids without supervision of at all. Bad news? He will likely not leave you alone without a restraining order because he sounds like a freakin psycho. Contact a lawyer and let them deal with what I hope is about to be your Ex husband. Let him know that if he comes on your property again without your permission you will be calling the police and if he doesn't listen you need to follow through. He may not be dangerous but he is crazy. Don't take chances with crazy.
11,Finally bought a double sleeping bag for my SO and myself. We're going camping tonight. I am so excited!
12,"Agreed-- even the most socially progressive guys don't necessarily believe women (even their SOs) when they describe sexual harassment, catcalling, and creepy behavior. Since they never see it or participate in it, they think it must be really uncommon, so we women are exaggerating, misreading people, or inviting it somehow. "
13,"Seriously, keep up with a mental health professional. My mother developed mental illnesses in her 30s during the post partum period because she didn't get help and my dad was working too much. her illnesses weren't realized until it was too late. "
14,"I talked up being a big sibling. 

""Oh wow! I'm so happy I have you guys to help me out with the new baby! You are going to be such great siblings. Thanks for being such awesome kids. We couldn't do this without you."""
15,"I don't think she's being cruel. I think she is 100% right and is just tired of you whining about shit that is entirely in your control to not be a problem. I think you should follow all of her advice and thank her for being such a great friend. I would have been one of the people that dropped you had I known you, be thankful she wasn't."
16,Part of being a grownup is doing things you don't like. One day out of our life for your sister doesn't isn't the end of the world.
17,[deleted]
18,why wouldn't you just tell your parents?
19,[deleted]
20,"If you want kids and he doesn't, this is doomed from the start. "
21,"If he's that good a friend (IF), he'd likely tell your husband. You think he'd be happy knowing his wife made a pass at his friend? Successful in your attempts or not you'd crush your husband. And what if, worst case scenario, he wasn't a good enough friend to say no? You shouldn't lean on him to be the moral rock so you can lean in further. 

The answer is remove yourself from the temptation. Don't bask in your wildly inappropriate crush. 

Stay. Away. From. Him.

Edit: typo"
22,"I think this is the most likely explanation. I have had friends, relatives and acquaintances with Aspergers become attached to me because I seem ""safe"" and non-threatening. They seem to present as highly emotional or nonemotional, and are constantly confounded with navigating human social-interaction. "
23,"First of all, Mark is an idiot, and second of all, how convenient to say ""let me cheat on you, otherwise our marriage won't last"". I call bullshit on this being some marriage helping initiative. Sit him down and tell him in no uncertain terms that you are going to be very generous and forget that he has ever asked you to consider something like this, and in return for your generosity he will understand he is being absolutely out of line and either get his head back in the game or talk with you straight if he's changed his mind about the wedding.

I also suggest that you ask Mark whether he also believes your marriage won't make it if you don't have this ... arrangement in place, and if so, why has he never mentioned this before someone had his ear. Tell him that you personally believe that your marriage will make it if and only if both parties are in for the long haul, and they are willing to cooperate, and if he wants to blame the fact he hasn't been sleeping around three days before the wedding, you ain't having that because you both know that's bullshit."
24,"Just have a talk with him. Even preface it with, ""I am going to force you to have the most awkward talk of your life for 5 minutes, and I promise that when it's over, I won't bring it up again.

Then let him know how you're feeling and about consent and everything. You are right to take this directly to him. "
25,"The same. She drove from California to Las Vegas to attend some conference she had to pay for (hotel, ticket, etc...). Almost all MLM do this same thing. Their actual business is to make you pay for these conferences and to feed profits to the top."
26,"Your parents have been defending your sister's misdoings for your entire life. But now she has done the same to your husband, and they still do.

Leave them to orchestrate their own drama. "
27,Possibly the most clueless OP to grace these parts in a while.
28,"If Melissa herself admits she ""picked on"" this girl, likely the bullying was actually incredibly severe.  Bullies normally rationalise their behaviour as ""just kid stuff"" or ""just joking around"" or ""having a laugh"".  The fact that she admits that she and her friends bullied her probably means it went pretty far...and the fact she has resorted to name callign and doesnt seem to regret  her actions indicates she hasnt really changed as a person.

Honestly your daughter deserves the heartbreak and then some.

&gt; . The problem being she isn't a school kid anymore, so I can't exactly ground her or punish her or strip her of privileges

If she lives with you, you can.

I wouldnt date a bully, much less an unrepentant bully of my close friend.  Your daughter seems self-absorbed and unpleasant.  Get her into therapy.  Maybe this will be good for her in the long run.

PS: That your ""go to"" response to this shit was to go to bat for your daughter, fight her battles etc, is very telling.  You shield her from the negative consequences of her actions...no wonder she ended up a spoiled bully."
29,"You act like ""causing an argument"" is worse than ""is a massive bigot who constantly spouts hateful shit""."
30,Blocking your path when you need space is also physical abuse. Taking your phone is abuse. Have you ever done those things to her or does she just do them to you?
31,"Avoidance is not a productive way to manage mental illness. It actually makes it worse. OP and his therapist should be working on strategies to help him be able to participate and function - avoiding this wedding is only going to exacerbate his burgeoning agoraphobia, which his friends have been pretty awesome about dealing with. "
32,"Yes!! Your dreams are everything!! Follow them or you will forever wonder, what if..."
33,This guy is just such a jokester! So funny. Was he actually leaning around his gf of three years to get this girl's number? What a kidder! /s
34,This is excellent advice. 
35,"I inferred it from his post.

Name calling:

&gt;she had been an immature, self-absorbed narcissist since early in our marriage

Assumptions about her mindset: 

&gt;Eventually we separated when she decided that the grass is always greener elsewhere

Implied insults about her job and/or skills:

&gt;She was a waitress then and is still a waitress now.

Assumptions about her relationships:

&gt;whatever guy she's leeching off of at the time

Assumptions about her thought-process (I can't imagine the ex actually told him this):

&gt;Ex wife refuses because this means she will get less cash for our child.

Assumptions and implied insults about her partner's job and/or skills:

&gt; She has a boyfriend but he is an unemployed wannabe poet or whatever it is he does

These aren't the kind of things you say if you are totally fine with a person.  "
36,You'll probably get a lot of nervous laughter because people won't want to hear about someone's (who they don't know) friend (who they also don't know) masturbating (typically a private event) with condoms on (weird).
37,Your roommate wouldn't have moved out if he thought what he did was okay. You were right on with your actions
38,Of course. Should have realised that.
39,"Ouch. I think your response is very reasonable but is it really pining for love if all I'm doing is being a normal family member? (As far as I can tell?) We're not exactly grovelling at their feet. We attend family functions like normal people and on the rare occasion when needed take care of stuff they are physically unable of doing themselves. (I.e. Father-in-law had a mini stroke, we went over to his house and fixed his roof that started leaking while he was recovering.) Maybe I'm wrong but I don't feel like this is pining. My husband and I aren't exactly falling apart from their lack of attention."
40,He's a kid who got kicked out of the house. He had literally no other options. 
41,"Oh...lord. Dude. How old are you again?

Your philosophy on money and relationships gets more alarming with every comment. If this is how you talk around your girlfriend, I completely understand why she's seriously hesitant about marrying you. She is running circles around you in the maturity and financial responsibility races."
42,look up the term 'strategic helplessness'
43,"I think it's kinda suspicious that your girlfriend said you probably just lost it and should just forget about it.  It sounds to me like she broke it by accident and is afraid to tell you.

But maybe the maid moved it while cleaning and forgot to put it back.  You should ask her."
44,"Noooooo, don't use the calendar method! It's based on the idea that you can know anything about this cycle based on last cycle, which is untrue. Ask anyone from an observant Catholic family with eight brothers and sisters! ;)

Billings, Creighton, Sympto-Thermal and other methods are as reliable as the pill with perfect use because they rely on the data *right now* to help you make a decision about whether or not to have unprotected sex. Standard Days, Rhythm, and other calendar based methods are FAR less reliable because they're predictive, relying on last month's data to make this month's choices."
45,"And if she says yes, that she thinks she has a good relationship with him, ask her how she would feel about or towards the person who exerted TOTAL control of her life to the point of monitoring every movement and communication? God, this poor kid. 

And tell her that this is the kind of behavior that causes people to snap and cut off all communication. Does she want that?"
46,"She's not making you feel like this. You are making yourself feel like this. 

You can change how you feel. You can actually get to know her and hang out with her, and get to see how she is. If you don't do this, demanding your boyfriend cut out an old friend is just....100% unreasonable. "
47,This question is too generic. Do you have some context for us? 
48,Thank you! That's how I feel. I mean maybe nothing would have happened but if it did I couldn't live with myself. She thinks her dog is totally fine and that's the issue
49,"I work in the medical field and I just had a kid at 38. My doctor (and all my research) indicated the risk of chromosomal birth defects (the kind which get more common as you age) was still less than 1 in 100. Higher than it would have been if I was 28, certainly, but still very small. As for pregnancy complications, that is a very broad term that encompasses a number of serious and not-so-serious disorders. I had HG, so my pregnancy would be classified as ""complicated,"" but while it made me pretty miserable for 9 months it did no harm whatsoever to my child. "
50,"Right? They're 60. They've managed to survive this long, let them have their fun

I hope I'm having that much fun when I'm 60, I'm 25 and my life isn't nearly that interesting. "
51,"It's not like you are married. If he is stressing you out and refuses to change objectionable behavior, you don't have to keep putting up with him. 

It sounds like he is escalating a kind of teasing or bullying. He knows exactly what he is doing. He is not oblivious. He is seeing what he can get away with. The more he can push you, the more he will push. 

Seriously, you don't have to put up with this guy. 

And no, you're not overreacting. Someone who negs on you about any body part or bodily function--peeing, sneezing, having a period, the size of your tits, the size of your bum, whether your eyes are too close together, whether your fingers are short--doesn't love you and you are not overreacting if, as a result of him trying to offend you, you get offended. 

A lover is supposed to have your back. A lover is supposed to support you. A lover is supposed to actually love you. "
52,"He did confront her though, he gave her ample opportunity to tell him what was up and she kept changing the subject. What if she had been cheating? Then would it have been wrong for him to use whatever means he could to find out?"
53,"&gt; You are allowed to have sibling-only trips!

Actually, you're allowed to have trips with whomever the fuck you want. Your boyfriend is lacking the autonomy needed to have a healthy relationship without being so needy and jealous. My suggestion is to go, but to also have a serious conversation with him about your need to be able to do things as an individual whenever you see fit."
54,"So, your mother could still possibly die even if you take the job? Look at it this way, you've had your mother your whole life. She's probably lived a long and happy life. However, your daughter's life is just starting out. You don't want a large chunk of that to be absent of a father. It builds resentment, no matter how good you think your relationship with her is. You've already lost so much time with her, do you really want to lose more? I'm not saying you shouldn't take care of your mom but given the choice, my mother would tell me my daughter comes first over her. "
55,"Man, i'm starting to think that credit reports should be a part of state marriage licenses just to make it a norm to help out people like this."
56,"""No"" is a full sentence and you need to respect that she rejected you. Don't be a dickhole and pursue her. Do you want to become 'that creepy clingy guy who wouldn't leave me the fuck alone when I told him blatantly I wasn't interested' in her stories?"
57,Do you have access to shared banking? It's possible there would be charges indicating what he did that night.
58,"Maybe you should try something like couples counseling instead? You need to learn to attack challenges in your relationship together, not apart, if you want the marriage to last."
59,"I suppose anyone higher ranking than someone else has power over them in the military. However, you are wrong about me ""going to his boss"" because like I said this dude doesn't work above him at his job. "
60,"1. Call the police. 

2. For you, if she won't call the police, call the landlord and put in a complaint about more people living there than are on the lease. "
61,"Dude. She told you no. She does not want to have sex have sex before she's married. She had been abundantly clear.

There is no ""compromise"" here. She doesn't want to. 

If you don't want to wait, that's fine and you should break up, but quit trying to pressure her."
62,"OP a similar situation happened with my brother's ex but the reason it was easy for everyone to stay in contact with his ex was because he was an absolute asshole at the time.. To her while they dated publicly and to the rest of us. If you asked him, he probably would have said he treated her like a princess but that was definitely not the case. Can you give more background on how your relationship was with her and if you regularly piss off your loved ones? That's the only justifiable thing - if you are an asshole. "
63,"Yeah, I only saw this post and the first post just now. It was so sad to see OP defending her now-ex and insisting that she was really the abusive and selfish one because sometimes she dated to have needs and feelings too. This update really is amazing to see.

u/solo-para-ti, you've done yourself a huge service by leaving him. It's wonderful that you were able to get out of the FOG and recognize that you were worthy of so much more than this. It was also really helpful if you to lay out what you learned from this experience so that other people could benefit from your advice in the future. I think that it will be particularly helpful when read in conjunction with your previous post. Hopefully, others will recognize the patterns that they've fallen into and start to break free from their toxic relationships by following the steps that you've laid out. You're a very strong person, and I wish you the best of luck going forward."
64,"I'm halfway convinced that the post is actually written by the husband, who's trying to see if he could get away with divorcing her via ""prank."" "
65,Just wanted to add: But don't feel guilty/ashamed for not yelling this time!  It is extremely normal to freeze up in scary situations and the fact that you didn't yell or that you took time to tell your family does not mean that it wasn't a bad situation or that you don't deserve to be taken seriously.
66,"Yeah Im going to call bullshit.

He would have had bruises on his forearm where you grabbed him.


Fingernails on the back in this situation only means that you guys fucked AFTER he rescued you.


"
67,"&gt;He cried and cried and cried and told me he didn't want to live anymore, without me.

That's rich. 

He conveniently skips over the concept of divorce and goes straight for suicide threats.

Forget about this manipulative, entitled jerk, and don't ever put yourself in this position again. "
68,"No, not fuck her, fuck HIM. At the end of the day a relationship only directly involves two people. It's not her responsibility to never engage your ex. It was your ex's responsibility to deny any engagement.

I'm not saying she's an angel or anything, but your anger is directed at the wrong party and in doing so , you are subconsciously absolving your ex of full responsibility."
69,"I agree. She should have asked. Yet, I think being ""pissed"" about it is a little dramatic.
Annoyed, sure.
Ask her to next time first talk about spending their money, sure.
Get pissed off and upset? Meh.
Don't sweat the small stuff.
"
70,"She's shutting down the convo because she does not want to compromise in any way. I would do the same thing, this is absolutely break up level incompatibility. The fact that you were waiting 6 years to bring something up like this is crazy to me. If this happened to me and they were adamant that their parents would move in, it would be over.

Your viewpoint is no more and no less valid than hers. She doesn't HAVE TO have a conversation about it if she doesn't want to. It's clear that it's not a thing you can change. So keep that in mind when talking to her in the future about this.

"
71,Just the thought of that makes me gag. Nope. Nope. Nope. 
72,"I am the last person to advocate lying. I'm all for open honesty. I hate relationships based on lies, but this relationship is not based on lies. He thought he wanted to date her friend, but he realized he wanted to be with her instead. That's just the way it happened. It isn't like he held a torch for the other girl all this time and kept it from his girlfriend. That would be a foundation of lies.

This guy has been with this girl for 7 years, stopped his boy crush on the other girl within a month, clearly loves his girlfriend and thinks she's gorgeous, and wants to marry her. It's not lying to say that he said a stupid thing in college, or to say that he only has eyes for her. He is so into her that he doesn't want her to be hurt at all. So why should he go out of his way to hurt her? 

I don't remember every stupid thing I said at 20, but even if someone shows me recorded proof of what I said back then, I'd laugh  now because that's ancient history."
73,"Came here to say this: Her cheating is not your fault. A spouse cheating is never the other party's fault. She cheated emotionally on her own free will so don't feel responsible for it, it won't do you any good in the long term."
74,"And even for couples who are both on board with moving overseas, it's often a lot harder on the one whose career isn't driving the decision.  You're familiar with the place by now.  You've got a built-in network with your coworkers and stuff to keep you busy.  None of that is guaranteed for her.  If she's already missing what she left behind, that's just going to exacerbate the situation."
75,"Yeah, I second the thing about never letting ANYONE know that you're home alone, EVER.  When I was a latchkey kid, my dad was always 'in the shower, he'll have to call you back'.  Nobody's going to try to start something if they think an adult is home."
76,He doesn't have a disability but his brother does. And yes were in the US.
77,"Earlier in this thread you mentioned that your SIL would only want to adopt out the baby if you and your wife were the adoptive parents. That indicates that your SIL intends to be heavily involved in your child's life. You need to consider the possibility that your SIL could change her mind and want the baby back once your wife (and you, in this particular hypothetical) has already become attached to it. Even if you legally adoptd it and the SIL had no rights, she'd constantly be in your business and potentially undermining your parenting. 

I definitely don't think you should adopt this kid, but I also don't think your SIL deserves to be a mother. Don't give in and adopt it because your wife is sad. She does not get to use this to blackball you into having a kid sooner if you're not ready. If you differ substantially on this even after counseling, get divorced. She will resent you forever if you don't take in this child, and you will resent her forever if you do. You need a mediator."
78,"At this point your husband is hurting him (and your family to be honest) more than you're all helping him. 

I live at home with my parents. I'm 29. Even in my early 20s I paid my own cell phone bill. Paid for my car repairs. Paid for my school. Paid for my credit card. Paid for my food. I paid for everything I wanted, except rent. I still don't pay rent but I contribute by paying for groceries, doing dishes daily, cooking dinners occasionally for everyone, taking my folks out for lunch, buying misc. things that are needed. 

He needs to be evicted. You need to sit your husband down and let him read this thread. Explain that you want to help him, but he isn't pulling his weight, he isn't paying rent, he's putting your family in danger whether he knows it or not (leaving doors open...?!?!?!). He's young, yes, but he's not an idiot and honestly, it sounds like you're both being taken advantage of. "
79,"I went through hormone induced menopause at 22... And it was a nightmare. Hot flashes are real and a NIGHTMARE. Remind your husband you appreciate him and find an activity! Putting your focus into something other than experiencing so many emotions at one time is a great distraction.


Good luck, *internet hug*"
80,"I love my bleached hair! People are always surprised when I tell them I usually only wash my hair about once a week because it's so much easier to get away with. My natural color is super dark, almost black without actually being black if that makes sense lol (I'm SE Asian). When I still had my natural color I could probably get away with 3 max, too. Now I don't even really use dry shampoo."
81,"You don't want these kids to be taken away from their family.

But also you describe that they cannot take care of them as well.

So if you set aside emotions (which strangers on the net can do a little) no matter how much everyone loves them, nobody can take care of them.

So, yes, I would call CPS on the mother.
And yes, I would stay anonymous.

They have an obligation to investigate what's going on before they take the kids away, so they'll draw their own conclusions."
82,"But it sounds like Op wants it. He did said that if he waits for her it will be worth it, which points out that yes, he wants to have sex. And if this is the case the fact that he's so young in a sexless LTR could affect his perception of what is normal. For a person with a standar level of libido, 9 years in a sexless relationship is wrong when you don't know what is really causing the issue or you're not taking steps to fix it."
83,More important than that is dad allowing this person to parent their children while still married.  The court will not look kindly at his behavior and choices at a time when his children need security.
84,"I want you to bookmark this page and give us an update when you're 30.  If you're still going strong then..... I'll have faith that these relationships can last.  But, regardless of your success thus far the bulk of these relationships don't last.  People grow and distance magnifies a lot of the negatives in a relationship and diminishes some of the most important things."
85,"Yeah, I kind of agree here.  Probably the best way to teach the lesson needed here is to make sure the sister feels the full wrath of the justice system, and gets a judgement making your parents accept the fact that she committed a crime against her family member for no real reason.  Sure, the parents and sister will throw a royal shit fit...and thats when you let them know that when they stopped treating you like family is when you decided to do the same.  Not to mention that according to the parents and the sister she didn't do it, so why would you think she would get in trouble?"
86,"&gt; Keep in mind - there is no chance that this was a message sent to the wrong person.

A friend (girl) snapped a mutual friend (guy) a tit pic meant for her boyfriend.  Both are in happy relationships and 1000 miles apart so definitely no cheating.  Shit happens."
87,"You have a happy, healthy relationship that leaves time to lead lives outside of your partner. That you weren't at all concerned about this before comparing it to someone else leads me to think you're fine."
88,Don't just bring it up with her- bring it up with the lawyer. You need to go through official channels to get this done. 
89,"Plus, he'd be fresh into it, not knackered and stressed from weeks/months of trying to do the same thing. (Yes, yes, his job is stressful too, I'm sure, but ""a change is as good as a rest"" and all that jazz.)"
90,"&gt;  I was totally on Depp's side before seeing the leaked video and his bloody message on the mirror

Welcome to the life of every domestic abuse survivor - ""Until I see irrefutable evidence with my own eyes, I am assuming you are a liar/attention seeker and he's innocent."""
91,"I think this is probably the most important comment - from the perspective of a manager of several folks that are able to work from home with discretion.

I have a standing policy that WFH is only - ONLY - permissible with childcare coverage - nanny, grandparent, whatever.  I do not under any circumstances permit WFH when it's just the worker and his/her child.  We have a word for that: It's called paid time off, and it comes in limited supply.

u/Ineedhelp0K - I am actually kind of shocked your direct supervisor is OK with this."
92,"&gt;The husband and his mother lived together presumably for ~18 years. They can't be that incompatible. 

That wasn't by choice.  It is often hard to put into words why you're incompatible with someone, especially family and grieving doesn't make that any easier. Instead of trying to have a calm discussion with her husband, OP went on the attack.  Then when her husband had to explain to his mother that what his wife offered wasn't a possibility and tried to discuss other options, OP said ""Fuck you"" real constructive right there.  OP should have discussed this with her husband first. She should have accepted his No and let it go for another day and not berate him right after his father's funeral.  OP cares so much for her MIL that she seems to give no fucks at all for her husband's well-being."
93,"It *might* be worth making a friends-locked post (AFTER you've cut any obvious possible leaks) stating briefly that you are dealing with a stalker, and asking that your friends please be wary when sharing any photos or information about you. 

You don't need to say who, or what they're doing or why, just leave it vague, but give people you trust a head's up. Getting into details or naming her makes the situation unnecessarily messy. You do not want it getting back to her that the situation is bothering you-stalkers THRIVE on your attention. Other than possible legal repurcussions, you do not want engage her at all.

Sometimes stalkers are really good at pretending to be normal, and may get info from an oblivious friend who has no idea what's going on. Like ""oh how's my ex doing? I was feeling nostalgic the other day!"" Then oblivious friend might mention you're taking a business trip, etc..."
94,"Yup. He's a cheater. GF should dump his ass and not look back.

She probably felt weird initiating sex with him because he's a slimeball."
95,"I was on the fence, seeing as she could apologize, until she brought the coworker into it by talking behind your back. The total lack of respect would be a deal breaker immediately. She doesn't respect you. Respect is necessary for a healthy and successful relationship."
96,"Slutty brownies are a real thing. They're basically brownies with everything, including but not limited to an oreo layer, a caramel layer, and a cookie dough layer."
97,Maybe being able to see that something good came out of such a terrible tragedy would help you. I think she may want to know the truth. 
98,"This isn't really blackmail.   You lied about something that was really important to him *and* you did certain acts with other gentlemen that you won't do with him (not that you have to do everything with every guy, but man, what an extra blow to your husband).

He wants out and he's giving you a pretty fair deal, in my opinion.  He's giving you the chance to get out and keep your reputation in tact.  I suggest you take what he's offering you.

Word to the wise for the future, don't lie to the person you marry."
99,"I dont feel like im abused he just gets too angry

--
if slamming your head into stuff, choking you, hitting you, pushing you out of a car, does not qualify as abuse to you, what does?

Sure he gets angry. Everyone gets angry. Not everyone beats up the person they are angry with. 

You are in major denial and you need to stay far away from this person. Even if you care about him - hell BECAUSE you care about him. If he loses you for good maybe he will get the help he needs. But you have to take care of you first. "
100,"It sounds like he responded a lot with even ""I'll see you later."""
101,"No, you can't give her what she needs. Frankly, I would be concerned that if anything happens to her, you are in a position where you could be legitimately accused of elder abuse. 

My parents were in a similar situation with my grandmother. After she got to a certain point, her physician sat down with my mom and dad and told them very frankly that if anything happened to my grandma, my parents would be the ones to swing for it. They knew what kind of shape she was in; they knew her impairments; if they wanted to continue to labor under the delusion that it was safe for her outside of assisted living, then they would pay the price when the inevitable happened. They finally found a spot for her in a very good facility indeed, and everybody's lives got so much better almost immediately. "
102,The big brains at Google are probably wondering why there's a sudden surge of 'early 2000s sitcom actors' searches. 
103,"Failing that last part, you could always ask a friend who she doesn't know to grab the camera from her hands and smash it against the wall before disappearing into the night, but at this point, it's probably just easier to get her thrown out. "
104,I think you should take your girlfriend's advice. They don't deserve a thing from you. 
105,"To me it sounds like your issue is not really about the number of partners but rather how she personally views sex. I think of the number of partners as being mostly irrelevant but her casual view on sex absolutely is. 

It's completely reasonable to not want to date someone who views sex in the same way. She sees it as a fun time, you see it as a deep bonding experience. It's a completely valid thing to break up over. "
106,"&gt; These surprise proposes when the couple haven't talked about marriage before are really manipulative, in my opinion.

Second only to the old gem of coming back with a ring and a proposal after having already broken up. 

"
107,We've had this conversation here before where I got downvoted - while it's obviously played up for movies the reality is that most overstretched Police Departments aren't going to do a huge amount when it's an adult who has run off. Not to say he shouldn't call them but I'd be very surprised if he gets much out of them at this stage.
108,"My birthday is September 11 and even though I'm not even American, there are people who think I have no right to celebrate it. 

Screw that. You could pull up a shitty/bad event that has happened on every single date on the calendar, mine just happens to be a well known one. You can't stop the world every single time a certain date rolls around because it really really sucked hard one year. "
109,"UGH! I know the feeling. As a kid, I would run home so fast and be so scared I was going to wet myself, all because the teachers wouldnt allow us to go. 

I seem to recall at one point that my mother came into school to explain to them that I needed to use the bathroom when I asked, because of my kidney problems and chronic water infections. They ignored it and were horrible to me about it, so I never brought it up again.. 

Sadly, my mother and grandmother have been plagued their whole lives with water infections,or kidney problems because of this weird ban on using the bathroom during lessons. My nana actually ended up being diagnosed with bladder cancer, that was directly linked to the amount of times she constantly held it, and the fact that she had been reducing the fluid intake all her life, because of the 'inconvenience' of other people. 

She's in remission now, which is great. But just think, if people and teachers werent in charge of when exactly a kid needs the bathroom, we wouldnt have had any of these issues. "
110,"I would personally be talking to a divorce attorney and do whatever they say at this point. She's checking out of your marriage. She's lying, being disrespectful and who knows what else."
111,"Sounds to me like she wants the adults to really let loose, which most parents will not do if they are keeping an eye on their kids. Not all ""whimsy, fun and carefreeness"" is child friendly. Case in point: Burning Man, Dances of Vice, etc."
112,Then you can have your BF in your next wedding!
113,"I really hope that this is because people are getting married later and/or trying not to make the same mistakes their parents did, as opposed to sticking together because divorces are damn expensive. Everyone goes on about ""the good old days"" but that's because you had no choice but to grin and bear it. "
114,Thanks
115,"Exactly. STDs are a big reason why HIPAA laws exist, especially HIV infections. I've had patients who had HIV or Hep C and word spread through the hospital about their serostatus. I watched as their quality of care diminished as more employees were unwilling to treat that patient. Moreover, when employees spread word to the general public it can violate that patient's safety and privacy. Your sister's friend absolutely deserves to be reported. Your TB test may be innocuous but at some point she will spill something that may ruin someone's life. I have no tolerance or patience for health care workers do not take their patient's safety seriously. "
116,I personally don't expect people to go through my browsing history when in my phone though. It's basic decency.
117,"It is pretty ridiculous for him to demand that you stay on the pill and for him to say no to condom/pulling out PIV sex if you go off of it. The doctor is recommending that you go off of the pill for a while before trying to get pregnant, so as long as he knows that piece of information, I'm not sure what his problem is. Sure, he can say no to all sex, just as you could, but that's like saying you either of you could leave any time you want or file for divorce at will. Taking a hard line and not being able compromising on this isn't a good sign for the relationship's readiness to have a new baby, which is going to negatively impact your relationship, sex, sleep, work, sanity, life in general. You're going to need to be able to compromise on a lot of difficult things to make things work out in the end.

Also, even if you're both fertile and doing everything right to conceive, it can take months to get pregnant, so I'd stop putting so much weight on the dates you want to get pregnant or go off the pill and just do it when you're ready."
118,"r/seduction
and don't ever start a post by describing how someone smells or their skin again."
119,"^ That is an excellent point. 

I had a roommate for 2 years who *never* picked up after herself. A simple thing like a once-a-week cleaning of the kitchen could take 2 hours to get it to a decent amount of clean, because anything this chick spilled...stayed put. It once took me 8 wet wipes just to get the dirt off the kitchen table. "
120,"Look, Im not saying whos right or whos wrong, but your viewpoint isnt more valid than hers.

Two people can be wrong, but only one can be right.

With that in mind, just because its your culture, or her culture, doesnt mean its the right thing to do. Ive always held the contention that a marriage is between two people and nobody else. This includes god or moving your parents in. These people will be a part of your marriage. No matter what you do. 

If I had to be honest, I wouldnt marry an indian woman that wanted this.

Parents are supposed to take care of their kids. Not the other way around.

Thats just my opinion. 

""culture"" doesnt give you a free pass to ignore what someone else wants. "
121,"How are you in your mid-thirties with this teenage bullshit communication and passive aggression?!

This is what I would have said in your situation: ""Hey, you are making me anxious with how you keep checking your phone and stuff and I would really appreciate it if you hung out with me at the ER because I feel a little lonely. I know this is cutting into time that you wanted to hang out with friends, but I really don't want to be here alone. Why don't we think of other things we can do with x friend group at a later time?"""
122,"Well, there are steps he can take to cut the interaction completely. He can go NC, Change his last name, file a restraining order, and make sure that he has his will in order just in case so that it doesn't go to anyone in that family."
123,Absolutely positively do not let an actively using drug addict into your home. That could easily turn into the worst mistake of your life.
124,"I agree with others.  Don't leave.  As hard as that is, don't leave.  This is why affairs are terrible...they ruin families.  Affairs need to be exposed to the light of day, not permitted to continue in secret.  I'm sorry your mother is doing this to you and your whole family.  "
125,"Sometimes I have a similar attitude problem as your boyfriend, and birthdays seem to be a big trigger for it. I get grumpy, and kind of diva-ish, for not good reasons at all. I'll try to explain what it's like and why it happens, but first I want to say: this is his problem, not yours, he's the asshole. Don't worry about it too much, it will (probably) pass pretty quickly.

For me, the birthday assholery is generally brought on by a two-fold disappointment. First, planned enjoyment tends to not meet my expectations, especially when it's been hyped (e.g. your planning and hints), which creates a disconnect between me and people I love (""why don't you know what I really want?""). This creates a bit of anxiety and isolation. Second, there's no good way to communicate this feeling of disappointment, because we all know how it sounds: just because I *feel* asshole-y feelings doesn't mean other people should be subjected to them, especially when they worked really hard, but at the same time, it's even more isolating to not be able to talk to people about it, and pretending to have fun on my birthday makes me sad. 

It's also always sort of about control: if someone else is in charge of making me happy, I stop doing the work I need to do to manage my own feelings and make myself happy, and start increasing expectations to an unreasonable level. I get frustrated because other people don't do as good a job at managing my emotions as I can myself, and I forget that the expectation that they do so in the first place is impossible/stupid.

A lot of posts here have good advice. In addition to letting your boyfriend talk about his feelings in a reduced-pressure environment, he might need to be reminded that your powers of love and caring have a limit, and birthdays do not equal license to deadweight on emotional labor ...phrase that however you want. He seems to want control of his birthday back (and he sure can get it by sabotaging everything!): give it to him, if you feel so inclined, and save the other things for a time he can appreciate them. Leave him alone, yeah, and wait for him to regain his sanity.

But also yell at him for being a diva."
126,"Exactly. I've definitely been a problem drinker and have done things I'm not proud of (never semi cheated like this, but definitely did inappropriate stuff that upset people.) The next day I owned it and profusely apologized to anyone I'd hurt. Not everybody could trust me again, but that's their right. The boyfriend's initial act could've been repaired, but he took the low, low road here.
"
127,"I'm with your boyfriend. Honestly, by remaining friends with her I would assume that you condone her actions. She is not a good person. The people you choose as your friends says a lot about you. Do you want to surround yourself with good people? Or people who cheat and hurt others?

PS I think it says a lot about you that even though you didn't know her bf that well you sided with a cheater. "
128,"You and your fiance have already given in to your family's request to have a big traditional wedding (instead of having an awesome, low stress trip to Asia that's just the two of you) that you really didn't want. They don't get to bully you about your name too. That's a decision between you and your fiance. End of story. If people have a problem then they have a problem.

I kept my maiden name. By the time I got married at 33 I was pretty used to it and I like it. And, like you, I had been building my career for the previous 10 or so years with that name. And its ok to feel like that's a big deal; you have a name that people recognize, you're successful in your career and you're an adult capable of making her own decisions.

Don't let them wear you down on this one. I think you'll probably regret it if you do."
129,If you like being woken up in the middle of the night with (non-consensual) physical pain then we probably have different definitions of what constitutes a fun party and I'm okay with that.
130,"So block him before you call her back. Don't just run your mouth, listen to what she's asking, think about the questions, and answer them directly, without giving too much extra information. You sound like you want to help this girl - I mean, what if she's trying to press charges against him, or just needs some insight into your experience with him - so help her. If you're uncomfortable during the call, you can always tell her you're not comfortable giving any more information and worst case, hang up and block her. "

133,"&gt; If so.. That's really really fucked up. There should be laws in place for that kind of shit. 

Won't happen. U.S. law has already decided that it doesn't want to deal with the shit show. They just care that the kid is taken care of. It is extremely shitty for men, but the alternative is that it is extremely shitty for the child."
134,"&gt; I stand by what I did at the party. If you think it's cool to kick people out of your home for doing nothing other then offending your SO by their sheer presence, fine.

It's your SO's home, too. "
135,"Oh my god, dude. This marriage is dead in the water. The busted cheater does not get the power to dangle their partner on a string while they hem and haw over whether or not to leave the relationship. They get to apologize promptly and sincerely, without expectations or demands, and offer total transparency for as long as it takes to rebuild trust in their marriage. Then, and ONLY then, can it be salvaged. 

Your wife just isn't that into you. It sucks, and I'm sorry, but burying your head in the sand will not fix that. Do yourself and your children a favor and get a lawyer. Leave before you have so much resentment built up that you can no longer co-parent effectively."
136,"It may be a bit cold, but at least she knows that her actions have consequences.

I don't know exactly quite how to feel about this either. "
137,What your boyfriend doesn't understand is that these problems he's addressing are *his* problems. You have been surfing forever and hanging around these friends/people going surfing for longer than you've known him. Some people just don't get that their insecurities are their own problems and not anyone else's. 24 year old me didn't get that and no one kindly pointed it out to me either. So you can try that and see if that changes his mind but if not...don't give up what you love. 
138,"&gt; I would be a little worried that this is all an elaborate revenge plot on Ashley's part, and that she's using Alex to get revenge on Melissa. But only a little.

I almost wondered if, while Ashley and Alex were friends, Alex was oblivious to the bullying (teenage guys can be a little oblivious) or Ashley never brought it up while they were actual friends out of embarrassment, they caught up, and she was honest about how she felt about his fiancee. 

I mean this does sound like a teenage romance novel though. "
139,Also why's he watching her and noting down all the times she gets up from her desk for reasons he deems unsatisfactory? Guy is controlling as fuck.
140,But you aren't living in the past. You have to live in the present. 
141,"Honestly I think this has less to do with them wanting your wedding to be a certain way and more to do with their feelings being hurt that in both cases you went to your fiance's parents first. In that context, they are basically saying 'why bother' because they feel like you are just making concessions because they are making a fuss, not because you want them to be a meaningful part of the process. It doesn't sound like they're going to actually be mad if you don't invite those people, they are just hinting that it would have been nice to be as included in the decision as the other set of parents.

Frankly, if your parents both agreed to split the cost of the wedding, I think it was an overstep for your fiance's mother to offer to buy the dress before giving your mother a chance to do so. I think your mother wanted that to be a shared experience for the two of you. It's not about the dress, it's about the excitement and joy that you have about the dress that is now between you and your fiance's mom, and your mother feels left out. Of course getting to pay for the tailoring isn't going to make her feel better - that probably just made her feel like more of a checkbook, while from her point of view it probably feels like you want your fiance's parents to be involved more. "
142,"He can't be reasoned with, but he's under no obligation to pay for her university. If he only wants to do it under certain caveats, he has that right. It's his money, and she isn't entitled to it."
143,"Your group of friends sound jealous and may be waiting in line just to be the next to be with you. 

If you are happy with your successful, good looking, well connected, educated boyfriend then what do you care what they say. 

Your friends are being wankers. Haters gonna hate. They've made their case, it didn't stick. Either they get on board or you'll make new friends. 

You do you. "
144,"You are taking one comment and going straight to crazy town with it. Seriously. Take a deep breath before you start hyperventilating. Wanting reassurance that he'll still have an option to be social after babies isn't worth a 3 zillion megawatt meltdown. 

And be honest, you do wants kids right now. "
145,"I am very confident it was a joke. It was a mean and tasteless joke, but still. If he were really so mercenary and cynical that he actually planned on doing that, why would he tell you about the plan three years in advance? My advice is to accept that it was a joke, but tell him that it was still hurtful and and demand an apology. "
146,I did it because he did in the post. Don't know why...

148,"The stuff you described you could literally do with anyone, those aren't good qualities!"

150,"&gt; But my father left the money to ME.

Before we even talk about ""the score"", as in the money and support they got throughout their lives, the above quote is **all that matters**. Your father, being of sound mind, determined the handling of his estate, and that you were the one to receive the bulk of it. I'm sure it was motivated by gratitude for your sacrifice and the relationship that you and your family had with him. 

Nothing that your siblings say, no argument can override this undeniable truth. Any accusations of manipulation are, in fact, attempts at manipulation on their part, whether motivated by simple greed, or guilt over the way that they essentially left you and your father to fend for yourselves. 

You owe them nothing. This was your father's last wishes, a small thank you for the unquantifiable kindness that you and your immediate family showed him in his later years. IMO, It would be an insult to contravene your father's last wishes

Keep the money. Stop engaging your siblings on this topic. Punt any future questions about the inheritance to the executor. You, your wife, your daughter, and your father knew the score--any bitterness on their part, any attempts to lie for personal gain or to assuage their consciences are their problem. It would be tempting to throw their college tuition, their weddings, their houses in their faces, but they are aware of all this--just like they were aware that he was no longer independent and in failing health, yet failed to even go through the motions to be with him or show that they gave a rat's ass--so what's the point in reminding them?

151,"Yeah, I can understand not learning to drive in NYC because you have no car, no-one you know has a car, you'll never own a car, and you have no opportunity.  

In the rest of North America, even if you live in a city where you can get by without owning a car and don't need to drive, it's a valuable skill to be capable of. "
152,"Yeah, I have a Billy Bookcase, and have a normally calm cat who once a day has what I call a witching hour and will run around the apartment at full speed. He's ten pounds and broken a cat tree by lunging at it at full speed. 

I think it's highly feasible that the OP's cat could have done this, especially around an unfamiliar person. Cats act differently around strangers. Just because he is a chill cat around the OP and his girlfriend does not mean he is always chill. And you sometimes hear about those stories where a family has to call 911 because their normally calm cat has them cornered on their room.

Either the cousin is telling the truth or he is not. OP is only ever going to find out if he is lying if he admits to it. OP will have his always doubt him if he insists he is telling the truth."

This is anecdotal, but also without exception in my far too many years working on a PhD.

158,"No, thats one thing i'm 10000% percent sure of. IRS stuff went down..no bank account after that."
159,So he has no bank account because he owes/doesn't pay taxes and doesn't want to get his account garnished?  It sounds like you have a number of problems with this guy.  I apologize if I'm jumping to conclusions.  I've read enough reddit posts that I'm never surprised when there is a lot more going on than what the OP states.
160,"The decision he made is just as permanent as the decision I may potentially make.

It is very much out of the blue. He at no point attempted to discuss he didn't want more children and consistently told me that he did. 

Just as he is entitled to not have more children if he doesn't want to, I am entitled to move on with my life if our wants and needs continue to move in opposite directions and not be fulfilled by each other. "
161,"Well, he made his limit clear after you basically forced him into doing something he thought was a bad idea, and you agreed to it. Now you're trying to change it. So yeah, I think you are wrong. You shouldn't have pressured him into doing something he wasn't ready to do, and certainly not by making fake promises."
162,"I totally see your points but if that's the case, he should have told me at some point that this isn't what he wants. He never said anything at all, and we've been planning things for a few days now. I even asked him several times what **he** wanted to do on his birthday, and like I said, he kept changing his mind and not telling me. 


I appreciate hearing your point of view because it's something I didn't consider. I'm still not totally sure how anything I've done would be annoying, though. He eventually wanted to stay home during his birthday and that's what we're doing. He wanted me to make him lunch, and that's what I did. My ""cute"" things don't go beyond getting him a couple of gifts and setting up fun little surprises for him (surprises as in baking brownies or blowing up some balloons, nothing that puts him into an awkward social situation). I'm not trying to force him to go anywhere, see anyone, or do anything he doesn't want (unless you consider a 20 second super easy scavenger hunt [which is a game we play with his daughter often anyway] making him do something).


I'm just not really sure how I could win in this situation then. Do absolutely nothing? Get him a card and and nothing else? I was just trying my best to do nice things for him and make him happy.


About the pregnancy thing: noooo, we're both 100% on board with an abortion. I don't ever want to have kids and he knows that. He's the one that would love to be careless with protection (""let's not use a condom this time"") but I'm always super careful because I didn't want accidents. It's a little bit offensive for you to accuse me of trying to trick him into having a baby or something because that is not at all the case."
163,"Theyve created a hostile work environment, you don't even want to go to work **because** of them."
164,"Inappropriate.

Also, there's no reason a 20 year old should be dating a 16 year old.  I know that's not what you're looking for, but it's still true.  "
165,"I think a really easy relationship test is: If this gets hard, is this the person I want to go through it with? Conversely; if there is an obstacle to the relationship do I find I want to overcome it or would I prefer to walk away?


If the answer to these questions is no you aren't running away from your problems, you're just not prolonging a relationship at an end. It doesn't mean anything is wrong with her or you, it just means the two of you aren't meant to be together."
166,"Ok, I have the world's smallest bladder (I stop twice on a three and a half hour-long road trip) and it's not because of a medical condition.  My boyfriend has accepted it because it's part of who I am.  I think your SO needs to be kinder about it, since you have been checked for problems. One tip for road trips: don't drink any coffee, tea, or soda. Anything with caffeine is a huge irritant for your bladder. Alcohol also causes me to pee constantly. So depending on the situation, I will just sip some water so I won't have to pee constantly. Good luck!"

None of which is your fault and, as tough as it is, is definitely *not* yours to take care of.  The $52k credit card debt alone is ridiculous.  Even if your dad had been earning $180k a year.  

Yes, it would be reasonable for you to pay for some of the groceries and even have a rent plan, but you absolutely *should not* take on this debt as your own.  That is not within your means and could cripple your financial capabilities until you are your parents' age or older.  

As for your sister, it's rough, as this is also not her fault but she's going to suffer quite a lot.  Ivy's do provide very substantial scholarships, if the right student comes along.  And, if all else fails, it isn't uncommon for students to go to a cheaper school for their first two years (at least to get general education out of the way) and then transferring to a more specialized school.

172,"When my husband and I were engaged, we took marriage counseling with the pastor who would be marrying us. At the tail end of our final session together, the pastor closed with a suggestion that I think is very appropriate given your situation. 

He urged us to think hard for a moment about any burning questions my husband and I had for one another; any admissions, any revelations, anything that either of us had been scared to unload or unsure about sharing or perhaps feeling guilty about throughout our 4-year courtship. That it was time to clear the air right then, and not at some inopportune moment after we'd already sealed the deal. 

So with that lingering in our minds, my husband and I walked to our car, sat in the parking lot and just talked. A lot. We both felt more confident in one another and our relationship after that discussion and that honesty has carried seamlessly into our marriage. 

Talk to him about your concerns and do it now. Before you wed. And assuming it goes well, congratulations. :) "

Long story short, he found out who his mom and dad were, what happened, he's met some siblings that are receptive to it, some of them want nothing to do with my dad, and it's been a cool thing for him to finally have some answers. 

He was mostly interested in the medical part. He wanted to know what cancers or diseases to be aware of, and it's actually helped me a lot because I have something my dad's birth mom had. 

So yeah, the choice is yours if you feel comfortable meeting her, but at the very least I would make sure she is able to see your medical history and the medical history of your parents. "
177,I see what you did there
178,[deleted]
179,Therapy. Call somebody today.
180,Those numbers only work in context of where you are. Try living with kids in silicon valley on 70k. You'll barely make rent and struggle to make ends meet.   Move to Kansas city and you've got a nice house and you're living the American dream.
181,"Get a smart phone, get a holster or holder that you wear everyday. It will look dumb, people will mock you but if it's on your body and pointed out repeatedly you'll be less likely to forget it. Get an ankle holster maybe. With a smart phone it will be harder to forget if you use it for more than just calls, you can use it to browse the web etc, it will be more integrated and useful. If therapy wasn't helping it won't help now. Set alarms on your phone to go off consistently so even if someone isn't calling it makes noise and draws your attention to it. "
182,"uh... what? why would lying to your spouse ever be a good idea, especially when it can hurt her and her family? 

He should tell his wife what happened, not jump to conclusions, and continue being honest with his wife."
183,"Then you didnt do anything wrong. You weren't romantically holding hands, you weren't leading him on, and you weren't feeding into his crush. You needed to know where the bathroom is and he showed you. You did nothing to earn any distrust."
184,"Ignore it.  If you can't do that, say ""I don't know what your problem is, but it isn't me"" and walk away.

You will find that life is much better if you simply don't talk to people like that.  If you have to be around her for family events, ignore as much as possible"
185,"Even if your bff wants him back, I don't think disgracing herself will make him respect her more: on the contrary, he'd only feel pity for her. Yes, she should be grovelling for not giving him a chance to defend himself and didn't give a second thought to his suggestion that ""the friends"" had done it. Think about his concerns: 

1. All her friends dislike him. 

2. He's been disrespectfully thrown out (this might as well have been the most humiliating experience in his life). 

3. Her parent hate him and will probably hate him even more. 

4. Her friends are meddling in their relationship.

If I were in this guy's shoes, I wouldn't give her a second chance unless she fucks off her parents and all of her ""friends""."
186,"Yeah, this is illegal in Texas. 

I had the same problem with the landlords at my last place-their daughter lived in the house, and they used to just show up with no warning, at least once a month. It was annoying, but more than that, it was frightening! Hearing someone mess with the door or talk downstairs when you're alone and not expecting anyone was seriously scary, and I almost called the cops on them a couple times because I thought someone had broken in. "
187,"Um, yeah, him getting insecure all of a sudden that you hang out with cool surfer dudes, and then suddenly using his mother's traumatic drowning as an excuse is some REALLY red flag-y stuff. If that's the case, I'd break up with him just for that cuz that's some really manipulative shit right there. Not to mention that it's all in order to get you to quit a wonderful life long activity that you love so that he can have more control over you and who you see. Red flag red flag!!!"
188,"I'm in my mid 20's and have been in this dept. for three years going on four. They have hired other newer employees within the prev. 1-2 years. In all honesty if something was to happen to me, they'd be in a lurch because of the responsibilities they've delegated to me since January and the upcoming burdens they will be handing to me as well. 

In mention to me having an early shift once a week, we have three shifts here: 8-5, 10-7, 11-8. I used to be on the 8-5 which then changed to 10-7. Because I'm finishing graduate school online, I asked to work one 8-5 schedule a week for homework purposes and they complained.. and I don't ask for days off / show up late / call in sick / etc. I'm pretty low maintenance compared to the other individuals here. I do know that my boss sometimes makes comments / suggestions similar to the ones sent my way to a few other ladies that I'm close with. We often vent to each other in a controlled setting.

EDIT: I don't know why I'm being downvoted for replying to a statement with further info."
189,"My boyfriend isn't my usual ""type"" that I prefer when it comes to dating. I almost said no to a date. And actually when I first saw him on tinder I swiped left. It was only after he approached me in person (we knew of each other through work) I figured why not? I was gonna be moving states in 5 months anyway. What's one date? Won't go anywhere. Won't do any harm. 

Well, as of this past Wednesday we hit 7 months since our first date. And I got a job to stay in his state for now. And I'm madly in love. He's the sexiest man in the world to me! All the little things I thought I wouldn't like, I have grown to adore. His bald head. His somewhat nasally voice. Oh my gawd he is so sexy and adorable and wonderful!!!

If I had said no I would have missed out on the best guy I've ever known. My happiest relationship in 28 years on this planet. One in which we've had almost no issues and the couple we've had he's handled me with support and love, even if irritated. He's held me while I cried. He's waited on me hand and foot while I had a crazy high fever. I've catered to him when he had horrible food poisoning and it hit him at both ends... He's currently patiently awaiting my return from Europe and didn't begrudge me going on adventures for two weeks. He's only supported me.

I'm glad I had the circumstances so that I said yes. I wish I had just decided to be a lot less shallow because he's wonderful. I know it's only 7 months and I haven't met his kids yet (too soon. That's at a minimum of one year) and it's still the honeymoon phase. But, if things keep going this well, I see us getting married. And he's that serious about me too."
190,"Forget the wedding... how is your marriage?

I've known people who threw huge extravagant weddings only to be divorced within 3 years. Remind yourself what your priorities are when you get resentful. Be grateful for your great(?) relationship with your husband.

"
191,"Exactly! If he confronts you about ~~his~~ your active account, he's giving you even more proof he's lying."
192,"This dude needs help.  That French foreign legion idea is stupid, and the type of thing someone who doesn't comprehend reality or has some crazy romantic idea of running away.  He might as well have said he was going to join the circus.  

Is this guy in therapy?  If not he needs it and he may need some people to intervene in his life or he is going wind up doing something stupid.   

Edit:  On further thought and I hope I am wrong.  Your brother may very well be planning his suicide...."
193,"You realize that you are being down voted so much because your point of view is so illogical, right? 

Did you come here to try and validate your feelings or to see if her actions are reasonable or not? You are making it very clear you are only wanting to have your feelings validated and her actions invalidated. Everyone is saying she is being very reasonable and that you are overreacting, but you are too butt-hurt to see the truth in what everyone is saying to you. 
"
194,She's not racist but.. she literally thinks being white and blonde is better than being black. How would any mixed baby they raise feel knowing their mother's opinions about this? 
195,"Christ, that is an awful way to phrase that :( I'm so sorry you had to go through that. "
196,"Also, for what it's worth, OP--Hunington's is associated with a short life span (does it run in your family? Seems like it would have shown up in your family if you had the genes) but stuff like celiac and even MS aren't necessarily associated with early death. Yeah, you'll have more shit to deal with, OP, but don't sell yourself short. Unless your doctor (and ideally, several doctors!) has told you you won't live past middle age, you may have more mileage in you than you think."
197,"First thing, 
I admire that you still see the things they did/do for you, you seem like a grateful and humble person and I admit that in your situation I wouldn't be able to see things like that. 

but they could buy you a mansion and a freaking helicopter and it still would NOT justify ANY of the abuse that you had to live through. Please do not feel in any way obligated to stay in contact with you parents and please take good care of yourself, which could happen by seeking professional help if you feel the need to. Lots of love to you!"
198,So has your wife been abusive your entire relationship?  At what point do you get sick of it an leave?  
199,Personally I'd rather support love than bigotry.
200,"Whatever game he was playing - and it sounds like he was up to something manipulative, comparing you to his ex was definitely 'negging' you, maybe he has his eye on another girl and wanted to officially 'break up' and string you along as a backup FWB indefinitely? - you handled it perfectly, kept your dignity, and should be proud of yourself for that. 

"
201,"It's not about the fucking money, jfc can you people even read? It's about OP's value and being told her step-mother ""contributed a lot"" so her children ""deserve more"" as if OP is not as important as her step-siblings."
202,Ask her why he didn't feel the need to apologize before she tried to make him do it if he's changed that much.
203,"Did you know beforehand the circumstances of your conception? I ask because if this person doesn't know and OP explains it, they could have some major issues. 

I wonder if just a no, because it would be too difficult, here's my medical info, would be enough?"
204,"I sense a bit of culture war here, because I think in some families taking in an in-law that can't support themselves after a loved one has passed away is a no-brainer. 

In other families, particularly in America, letting a parental in-law come stay in a home where you have a family of your own is unfathomable, even if it seems financially logical. It's just a matter of boundaries. I understand it because while I love my parents very much, I know I had a much better relationship with my mother after I moved out on my own. My mom has passed now, but again, while I loved her and she was one of the best people in the world, it would have been toxic to live together.

I don't think either attitude is wrong, but I think it's very reasonable for OP's husband to not want his mother living with them. I think it was *very* unreasonable for OP to make the offer without consulting him. And incredibly inappropriate to yell and undermine him in front of his mother. Who did that help? No one."
205,"Agreed. 

In addition, this is why I hire professional pet sitters instead of friends. Yes, it costs money, but they are insured for this kind of stuff. "
206,I'm a huge dog lover. She's in the wrong. Why didn't she let him out before she left? If she wanted you to let him out she should have said something. It's not your place or your dog. 
207,"""I am dating someone I like/love and care about, and I refuse to discriminate based on skin color. Nobody who loves me would make me choose between two people I love."" 

"
208,"Yes, they're jealous.

No, telling them to stop will not make it any better. Jealousy is a very powerful emotion.

OP, unfortunately, they were never your friends. Real friends would never act like this. They were just hanger-on's who didn't have the balls to ask you out because they knew you were out of their league.

In their mind, they thought they had a chance. They might even think you were leading them on. These kind of losers think any girl who is nice to them must be attracted to them.

The only way to handle this is to cut them off. Don't talk to them. Don't hang out with them. Get new friends. Why would you want to be friend with losers who can't get good grades, who are jealous of your BF?

Oh, and from now on, **don't be friends with Nice Guys^TM - guys who pretend to be friends when they're really not. If you think they have a crush on you, that's the time to cut them off. Don't wait.**"
209,"I don't understand how selfish you have to be start an emotional affair with the best friend of your spouse. I really cannot understand your thought process nor your faux-pology of ""well I'm just too extroverted, it's not my fault, but I feel bad.""

In answer to your question, no, there isn't a way to repair it. You don't get to stand on your smashed sand castle and make a pouty face and expect things to be OK. Jesus christ."
210,"&gt;  I've tried suggesting that she be more ""present"" this time around, saying things like ""Last time you were so distracted you missed most of the ceremony. I really wish you'd leave your camera at home this time so you can actually watch me graduate."" She just ignores me. 

Stop being polite. Be rude. 

""Aunt, do not bring your camera. They have professional photographers to stop annoying family members from getting in the way and ruining the day for everyone else."" Don't play this off nicely, look her in the eye as you say it and tell her that you mean *her*. 

""Aunt, I have shown a photo of you to the security present. You are only allowed to take photos during the *designated* photo opportunities. If you raise your camera *once* outside of these times, security will escort you out and will confiscate your camera."" Follow through with this. 

""Aunt, if you take a photo of me against my will, I will spit at your camera/smash it on the ground."" Again, follow through with this.

""Aunt, you're no longer invited to my graduation ceremony because you cannot control your behaviour.""  Get your mom to back you up. 

If she gets disruptive, treat her like a misbehaving dog. Reprimand her, *loudly*. ""NO! Bad Aunt! We talked about this! I said NO PHOTOS. Camera away! Now!"" Embarrass her, draw attention to her, shame her. "
211,"""I look bad to my friends"",  ""it takes longer when my husband brings me food"", ""no one will be there to wait on me if my car breaks down"". You sound really self centred. What exactly are you contributing to him in return for these expectations? If it's that much of an issue, ask your husband to chip in for any one of the DOZENS of services (chauffeurs, food delivery) available to you to satisfy your obsessive need for convenience."
212,"Holy shit, why is it so hard for so many commenters to understand that they didn't intend to keep the damn dog? They were just holding it safe *in their yard* (not even in the house) while putting up signs to find the owner. She talks about the signs and everything right in her post. 

Which makes it ten times more unreasonable for the bf to flip out about the dog. "
213,"I don't really see the difference between that and tipping a waiter.

I've heard that waiters expect to be tipped though and therefore employers in america give them a lower wage, on the understanding that their wage is brought to a more reasonable level through tips? Tipping culture in America is weird, man. "
214,"Been there. 

In my case, the guy had an average-sized penis, and was a good kisser, but that's it. A lot of the same things you said - his idea of foreplay was to do that ""wax on wax off"" motion with his WHOLE hand over me. That's it. A clit? He didn't know what it was or where to find it. Boobs? A few hard squeezes was all I'd get. 

But the worst part, the absolute worst, was how FAST he got off. He'd dry hump my stomach and make a mess. But I was like, ""okay, he cums fast, but that just means we'll have another session. Guys always last longer the second time around, right?""

Wrong. One morning, we went three rounds in an hour. And he still came within 10 seconds of entering me on the third round. (No exaggeration)

This was in college and I wasn't very direct. I'm still not big on confrontation, particularly with people I care about (I can usually only confront a problem head-on - no pun intended - if I'm pissed off and angry). So I planned a date night and took him to a lecture on campus. Dorian Solot and her husband put on this amazing lecture at colleges all across America called ""I &lt;3 Female Orgasms."" Part of it is sex education, addressing issues like slut-shaming and other feminist issues, but a large portion of it is also about how to please women, different technique to try, and how every woman is different. 

Sadly, even these professionals couldn't help him. Maybe I should've made it clear that there was a reason I was bringing him to this (I'd think it was obvious if your gf drags you to a lecture on orgasms as a date), but he just went about the same as always. And ignored any suggestions I'd hesitantly make. 

So, yeah, I ended that relationship. 

But the good news is that there is now a book by those same ""Sexperts."" The book is called ""I &lt;3 Female Orgasms"" and it would be great to read together. It includes things to do or try for women that can't get off from penetration (which is likely not going to happen if he's tiny), how to talk openly about sex, etc. 

Good luck!"

216,"This has been happening for FIVE YEARS. They've had this conversation over and over with absolutely no improvements. That's not ""jumping straight to divorce."" It's recognizing the reality of the situation - he likes it this way and doesn't want anything to change, even though she's miserable."
217,"Sometimes in bad relationships one person tries to slowly chip away at the things the other person really likes. It seems to me like controlling people do this so that at the end of the day the only hobby, passion, source of happiness in their significant other's life, is their relationship. For example, I have a friend who hates make up just because his gf started liking it. Then she stops wearing make up and joins a kick boxing gym. Suddenly, kick boxing isn't cool either. You see where I'm going with this? It's not that your GF gave away something valuable. It's that she got rid of something she knew you loved and wants to make you feel bad for ever liking it. She isn't just attacking the power rangers, she's attacking you for liking anything related to comics and gaming. It's some bizarre power play that shouldn't be tolerated. Why does a 9 year old need a vintage toy? Why would she even think that giving the toy to the 9 year old was a good idea when she knew they were valuable and she could sell them on ebay and buy 10 toys for 10 kids instead of giving one kid an old toy he probably didn't even want? Its clearly not about the charity. It's about taking something from you. I'd dump her. "
218,"I'm saying it's hard to get a read on the situation as a whole. We skipped 7 years in this story and by the sounds of it a fair amount happened in those 7 years.

The best I can say I think is to give it time. I assure you the intense hurt you probably feel will fade. If you're committed to this, then you're doing the right things with marriage counseling and each working on yourself. As for what you do with this revelation, give it time. The pain does diminish, the trust will come back, albeit slowly, and dependent on her continuing to do the right things. "
219,"So every 5-6 years you're going to tell your boyfriend to piss off while your friend looks after you, or...? What about when you're living together or married? What about if you get pregnant and have morning sickness? Will Ryan come over to bring you ginger tea while your husband sits in the living room?"
220,"This is true, you seem to be doing all the compromising here.  What if you frame it like a negotiation -- ""I'm willing to do X for you, what are you willing to offer to help meet in the middle here?""



Are you allowed to do other things while you watch tv, read magazines or surf the internet on your laptop?  Why are you driving all the kids to their things, and then she's counting that as if it's time you are taking away from her?"
221,You know I really didn't think of that. Abort my last comment! (Should I delete my comment or just leave it there?)
222,"&gt; He's nervous because as an hourly employee, I am eligible for over time but since I've been here so long, my hourly rate is so high, he does not want to pay me over time. I'm really doing him a favor by taking his and other admins calls after hours.

I'm really not sure why you'd be okay with playing along with this. Your time is valuable, you should not be working for free. If your current employer is not willing to pay you the amount that you are worth while still taking advantage of your skills, someone else out there will pay you what your skills are worth. "
223,"She'll survive, you're giving yourself waaay too much credit for her life satisfaction. "
224,"I don't think that commenter was trying to imply that not wanting kids was selfish or saying it was ok for OP to say. I think they were more focusing on the big issue. Like if someone tells you they jaywalked in order to commit arson and you say ""Dude, the jaywalking isn't the problem. You burned down a house!"" You're not necessarily saying that jaywalking is A-OK. "
225,"Is it outside the realm of possibility that he still thinks he has a chance to get back with his ex? 

You're definitely not the crazy one here. It's odd behavior, and there's likely something under the surface."
226,"I knew a girl in a very similar situation. Her sister was also a model and had special permission to skip all the tests/quizzes and only take the final. Since her homework counted for ~85% of her overall grade, my friend would do all the homework and the sister would easily pass her classes by pulling a few all-nighters to get a decent grade on her exams. OP's sister might have the same arrangement.

"
227,"It's better to end it over the phone, via text, whatever, than cheat. Do it now. Then tell 23 M, ""when I said yes to being your girlfriend, I was still dating this guy. I just broke up with him."""
228,"No matter what happens in the phone conference, their behavior will only get worse.

The only thing you can do is not make the call about you, but about the department and the work.

The manager is responsible that all work is done properly, because it is directly related to revenue.

However I am afraid this conversation is all about you and your work, and you will have little defense.

I don't know where you are located, but maybe you can ask for a mediator, or or an independent assessment of your work.
Or reassignment to another supervisor?

If you end up in the middle of a shit storm again, stay professional.
Let them make fools out of themselves if they want to.

If this is not going in the right direction, start looking for another job, your health and peace of mind are not worth this.

When applying for new jobs, do not mention this fuss ever. Ask if the nice guy wants to put up a reference for you.

Good luck."
229,"Go to the dead bedrooms sub. You're 18 and you can find people you'll be more happy and compatible with - I know it doesn't feel like it now, but you can and will find others. That's a pretty big thing to disagree about - sexual frequency as well as abortion stuff. Sex is maybe 10% of a relationship when everything is fine, but when the sex is bad or you aren't having it at a pace acceptable to both partners, it becomes 90% of the relationship. "
230,"&gt; To be fair she reached out to someone above him in his chain of command.

That's *precisely who she should have reached out to*."
231,"Highly doubtful, if someone is on your premises without you inviting them and you telling them not to show up uninvited and pretty much ""breaking and entering"" especially if you're away from home - family or not isn't legal in the least.

It's like saying ""My ex keeps showing up at my home uninvited despite me asking them not to"" I doubt an officer would ask ""But they've been welcomed into your home before? What's the problem?"""
232,[deleted]
233,"Has he talked to his doctor about this?  I'm no medical expert, but if anyone I knew told me that their sleep was interrupted this much every night, I'd suggest to them that they go get tested for a sleep disorder.  It's not a good situation for either of you, even if you did start sleeping in a separate room, he'd still be having this problem.  But, short term, yes sleep in separate rooms.  You need all the rest you can get now and when the baby comes, but also go to the doctor with him so you can describe all of this to his doctor."
234,"I feel like 3/4 of the situations on here could be avoided if people just learned to say, ""Fuck off.""  When you're an adult, just because someone says you should do something does not mean you have any obligation to do that thing, and if it's unreasonable you should not be afraid to tell them in strong terms that you are not doing that thing."
235,I agree. Move out. Now. Do not waste your time. You probably love your GF. But this situation is slowly going to make you hate her. Move out.
236,Age is not really relevant here.  Everyone wants an extra $20k.
237,"She's paying all the bills. He's not contributing at all, and by the sounds of it, not contributing much to the future childcare/current household chores either.

Yeah, I think she gets to make the majority of the decisions. *No, I don't think he gets to treat her like she's the irresponsible spender*, which is the meat of the post that you seem to be willfully ignoring. Yes, I would think the same way about this if the genders were reversed. "
238,"Show her /r/raisedbynarcissists and /r/JUSTNOMIL and to top it off /r/JUSTNOFAMILY 

Then ask her if she wants to have a son once he is a grown ass adult."
239,"Yes! I'm surprised how little other commenters are making of the fact he just assumed she was on birth control. Even if that was a 'reasonable' assumption he was still risking STDs. Maybe OP should get that checked out, too ... "
240,"Just based on what science has been able to figure out about memories, the whole ""something happened and repressed it and it all came back now"" isn't really a thing that realistically happened.

Your wife clearly has a bucketful of mental issues here, and who knows where they came from. Perhaps she *does* have some abuse in her past that she just hasn't shared with you. Or perhaps she's just got this specific set of mental health problems that have put her in this position. Bottom line, you can't really know, and you can't really change the situation.

The fact that you waited for 9 years to have sex is a big issue here, especially along with the fact that she didn't want to be naked around you, etc. She's needed some big-time therapy for *years* now, and it probably didn't do you any good to stick around for 7-8 more years waiting for her to get better magically.

If you want to help her, then point her towards mental health resources. Other than that, it's time for you to get some divorce papers in order and try and find someone a little more mentally healthy."
241,"I once got pulled into a wedding  (briefly) in Benin, because I was walking by, as a tourist, and half the town was there so they thought it would be rude not to linclude the wandering foreigners. My favourite bartender in Lagos was really jealous that Western father's could throw a wedding without being expected to feed hundreds of people, he said he'd be considered stingy if he turned anyone away, even if he didn't know them!"
242,"Is their father in the picture at all? Is your Dad the only Dad they know? The only thing I can think is that maybe you'll get all of your mother's stuff and if they don't have a father to inherit from too? But that still doesn't make sense.

I'm so scared of in some way making my stepson feel like this. I don't have kids and his father and I are debating adding to the family because we don't want him to think he's being replaced. This is in no way acceptable in my book. I'm sorry they are doing this."
243,"So you would rather him use you as his doormat mommy?  

You know you are just helping enable his shitty behaviour, right?  This could have been a learning experience for him to get his act together, but you and hubby decided to just become another set of enabling parents. 

You are not doing him, and more importantly yourselves any favors by letting him live with you. 

Kick the brat out. He needs to live in the real world. "
244,"It's not the friend's place to be impulsive and dye her friend's hair, after LYING about it when asked.  That goes way beyond reasonable boundaries.

I would drop the friend due to 1) the lie and 2) her doing something to my body without permission.  ""It's just hair"" is almost as lame as ""boys will be boys""."
245,"I feel like the bigger issue is that you work with him in a place where your father works too. Could the age thing be a problem? Sure, but dating a coworker could be an even bigger issue, especially if it's against Company policy. "

Sometimes that's not a good enough reason."
247,"You are absolutely setting yourself up for disappointment here. People tend to prioritize their own nuclear families. If you make it logistically difficult for guests with children to attend, they will just say no. Especially guests that need to travel to attend your wedding, guests wit young children that may be breastfeeding, &amp; guests that don't have trusted family available to watch their children overnight. The logical solution is to offer a babysitter in a nearby location where your guests can check in on their children, but you've already rejected this option.

Have you considered that you &amp; your fiancé have wildly different opinions on children &amp; how that may affect you in the future? Yes, you're both childfree, but he seems to tolerate children while you don't want to be near them at all. Have you discussed what happens when you're invited to a niece or nephew's birthday party, for example? If he has siblings that may have children someday, you may be in for a lot of arguments."
248,I think the wedding is going to happen and the poor bride is going to be left waiting and embarrassed in front of all her guests.

Honestly, if he doesn't appreciate that, or tries to pressure you into sex, then he isn't worth your time. 
Also, well done you for making such a drastic change, and good luck. "
251,"In reading this the following points occur:

1.  She never confessed.  You caught her and she admitted only what you already knew.

2.  ""he even left his wife, at least partially for her. ""

I find this extremely unlikely in the absence of physical relations.  As in 99:1 against.  

""She blames this on libido and dyspareunia.""

Well, you are the doctor.  But aren't these two conditions frequently 100% subjective based on patient complaints, and with no objective clinical findings?  

Hire a PI and ""lawyer up"" are frequently overused bits of advice.  But well warranted in your case.  Most likely ""lawyer up"" first and then have your mouthpiece hire the PI.

You need to honestly ask yourself one question.  If she really is continuing her affair(s), what would she do differently from what she's doing now?  


"
252,Right. And some people have themes to the art in their house. I know a painted portrait of anyone wouldn't fit the theme of my home.
253,"I was about to say, this is adorable and while I'm sure there are girls who might be shitty and sexist about it, I really think a lot of women would be 1) relieved OP is not cheating, 2) impressed with the knitting, and 3) sympathetic about the gender role anxiety, maybe even sad that OP couldn't confide about it. There ARE some ""ugh, I need a manly man"" types, I'm sorry to say, but I think most women would think it was adorable and understand."
254,"I'd hug him haha, handshake, whatever you'd normally do. 

It'll be weird but if the conversation is good he might find your nervousness about the chair endearing. My step-brother (born disabled) loved when his current girlfriend asked him nervous questions about his chair and such on their first date. She didn't get the hug thing either. Went for a hug, ended up awkward but broke the ice because she giggled and he loved her laugh. 5 years later and they're getting married this summer."
255,"My parents paid for my college education and all costs associated with it because they wanted me to direct my energy toward studying instead of splitting it between school and a job. (I had summer jobs, but I didn't make enough to put much of a dent in tuition.) That doesn't make me spoiled; it makes me *lucky.* You clearly understand the worth of what your parents are doing for you, and you seem to have good instincts and habits about money. From what you've told us, your attitude is fine; your exes were just jealous."
256,"This is the best advice here OP.  I was like scream ""FIND A NEW GAMING GROUP NOT FULL OF ASSHATS"" after I read the post.

Real friends wouldn't treat you like this.  If these people are your friends, the wouldn't let your ex get away with his power play bullshit either.  "
257,"Best advice here. DONE, SON!"
258,"No condoms, no sex, period. And send this guy on a *fast* trip to dumpsville, because he's got a crap attitude to have at 32 years of age, besides not really sharing your feelings for him. 
It's going to hurt, but you will be better off down the road."
259,Having fun isn't hard when you've got a library card.
260,"The funny thing is, usually that logic is held by someone who isn't exactly a prize. You'd think they'd worry about being ""stuck"" before they decided to commit themselves in marriage. "
261,"
&gt;Although this isn't a big problem I'd certainly be careful. It sounds like she's trying to control you because she doesn't agree with such a trivial aspect of your life. Watch out for any future issues like this.

This, right here. Be careful, OP, this is an yellow flag. "
262,"And if you stay you'll post yet again. You can not control his behaviour by changing your own. If you follow his rules he'll make new ones. I know you don't want to hear this, but regardless of what you do his behaviour **will** escalate. Please get out now. "
263,"If he persists with the ""everything is under control"" thing, just say ""it is not under control if I feel uncomfortable. We need to talk about this now as a team.""


If he keeps persisting, tell him you're uncomfortable with the lack of communication you're having, and you'd like to go the therapy for it."
264,"They still have a great deal of respect and love for each other to have lasted this long and raise two beautiful children together. Who cares what they get up to in their private time.
"
265,"This is one of the things I was unaware of before I started reading this sub. I'm academically familiar with patterns of abuse and have done a lot of reading on it, but these little things (not that sleep deprivation is little, but it seems littler than physical abuse) don't come up. Seeing how many people have experienced this was really eye opening. And it makes total sense: it's easier to manipulate someone who is sleep deprived, and cutting off someone's ability to sleep is such a fundamental act of control. "
266,"...I just assumed it was the opposite of excel, like instead of excelling at stuff, you're failing... incelling..."
267,What did your father do?  It's hard for me to imagine someone going from a 180k a year salary to zero unless they were caught red handed doing something unethical that would black list them from their field.
268,And the lack of trust she has shown by not disclosing this important part of her life? Maybe they cancel out and they can get over it or maybe they don't and they split up.
269,"Jesus christ OP your brother isn't being stupid or crazy. He's (somewhat ironically) being a better dad than most by accepting that he can't give his daughter a good life, and trying to give her to someone who can.

Whether or not you adopt her is up to you and your husband. The one thing you need to do is have a little goddamn compassion for your brother. Apologise for screaming at him and help him get in touch with his wife's parents and an adoption agency."
270,I'm sure his fwbs were very special to him.
271,She's also ripped apart her husband &amp; his mothers relationship the day after the funeral by forcing him to be the bad guy and say no and leave his mother in tears. I really feel for Husband right now. 
272,"I hope you forgot the ""ex"" in front of ""wife""."
273,"You really should make them pay their consequences. You have your priorities straight. They, on the other hand... Sounds like complete assholes. You should be the one suing them. 

That's hilarious. ""They came out unscathed"" ""My kids barely died why are you talking about money"" If they can't even park a car, they don't deserve their license. It's hilarious that she plays the victim card. It just shows her true colors, I guess. Once you get everything settled, cut all contact with them. Leave your house locked, take any keys they have of yours so they can't access your house anymorw.

I'm sorry you're going through this. Just because they're family doesn't mean anything. They've just proven it. You should treat this situation as you would with anyone else. "
274,"""Dad, I don't know if you're aware of your behavior but you're embarrassing me. I don't know if you're doing this on purpose but you need to stop before you affect our relationship to the point of ruining it"" 
Also, you need to spend less time with him in public. Ignore him. If he gets angry tell him that you won't deal with it and that he needs to be reasonable and realize that it's become a problem. Maybe talk to your mom/older siblings and they can talk some sense into him."
275,"Getting her out if your home is crucial but doing so will not repair the damage your husband has done to your marriage by forcing you into this situation for so long, or his resentment of you for insisting on putting her in a home. If you do decide to continue the marriage, marriage counseling going forward is an absolute necessity."
276,"OP, I used to be just like you. Don't go to that wedding. Please. Something tells me Fianceé is luring you in, if that makes any sense. She could be trying to scrutinize you, and see how long it takes for you to crack and 'ruin her wedding'. 

You fucked up big time. What makes it shady is that it was only two months ago. People usually take WAY WAY WAY longer to forgive and forget when it comes to something of this proportion. Her change of heart is way too suspicious. Send a nice gift from the registry, and leave it at that. "
277,"Commit it all to paper NOW. It doesn't matter if you're embarrassed, you idiot. You should have thought of that before you told your girlfriend to let another man fuck her bareback (you total and utter fucking idiot) and then told her you'd stand by her!! (is there a word stronger than Idiot?!)

Go to a lawyer NOW. Tell him every embarrassing detail, INCLUDING HER PLAN TO FORGE YOUR SIGNIATURE AND YOUR REFUSAL TO SIGN and don't fucking sign it! 

You made your bed, now fight the fuck back out of it, but don't just LIE IN IT!!"
278,"&gt; But, why do you need to have private conversations that your wife is not privy to?
&gt; 

What kind of question is that? Have you ever *been* in a relationship with a woman?

&gt;  H &amp; W should have no secrets from each other.

Secrets are one thing. Monitoring message traffic is another one entirely."
279,"That's such an asshole thing to do. When I was 16 some 19 year old college guy dated me and asked to be my boyfriend. He did the EXACT same thing. He told me there's a chance of him finding someone his age and better, he would leave and even told me he has a crush on an older woman and if she ever came on to me then he would have sex with her, even if we were together. I didn't think much of it back then BECAUSE I WAS 16 AND YOUNG. I didn't know how relationships were supposed to be, how boyfriends were supposed to act. I thought this was common. Now that I remember everything the scum bag said and did and it pisses me off. Knowing how much he fucked with my head just gets me mad at myself. Don't be that guy. I'm saying it from experience don't do that to this sweet young innocent girl. She doesn't know better, but you do. Just don't even have sex with her, that's the only thing I don't regret about my relationship was that I never had sex with that guy. It's best to find someone else"
280,"Yes, I was thinking the same thing.  She's not 12.  "
281,"You are spot on.  Similar thing happened to me and my GF.  I took a job with significantly more money that would further my career, but would be moving across the country for awhile and traveling non-stop.  I ended up taking it (we were together 7 years at that point and met when we were 19).  There were hurdles for sure, but it worked out because it was the right relationship.  OP, take the job and do a long distance relationship.  Maybe she will move out with you after a few months, or maybe she won't.  Neither of you are wrong in this situation."
282,"She's not ""prejudiced against white people"".  Nothing she said in the original post comes off as rude or offensive beyond typical college-student-getting-involved-in-social-issues-for-the-first-time.

And if you consider ""involved with BLM"" to be a bad thing that speaks volumes about your own prejudices."
283,"No, you really don't have any right whatsoever if she's on her property. It wouldn't hurt to approach her nicely and ask her to move, and why, with the perfect understanding that she can tell you to pound sand. Be graceful, either way. "
284,"No. Any time your auto damages anything (another car, a stroller, a utility pole, a wall. A house, a horse drawn carriage) you, the driver, must leave information and if it is serious damage, report to the police.  Hit and run applies not just to persons but to property, usually cars, houses, boats, trailers, motorcycles. Etc. 

Happens quite a bit where I live.  And Reddit had an article about some poor Californian whose house had been struck six times by cars.  Legal action in each case.  

Cars may not destroy houses without consequences. "
285,"I would take a general-but-true approach to discussing it with the wife. I would just tell her that you caught your brother saying some really rude and ungrateful things about both of you, and you've decided to remove him from (or dramatically reduce his place in) your life until he grows up."
286,"Why *would* you walk in eyes wide open? That makes no goddamn sense. What is the point of marrying someone who you know is going to cheat on you?

You talk like a mentally ill person."
287,"Frankly I do think it's creepy. I'm a 25 year old female and the thought of going after even an 18 year old guy seems weird and creepy. I can't imagine being in my 40s and thinking ""yea that 20 year old guy whose diapers I changed seems like a sexy partner"" eww "
288,"LOL what? So, even though she has enough money and it's completely her money, it's shallow for her to spend it on something she likes? Are you for real right now?

There are TONS of shops all over the world that specialize in classic cars. If she lives in a major area, I'm sure there are a dozen nearby. She can get quotes and go with the best. There are plenty of regular shops that are also equipped to service classic cars. 

She lives in a major metro with public transport, so gas doesn't really matter. Plenty of modern cars, like trucks, get shit get mileage as well. 

You sound hyper judgmental. "
289,"Yeah I have two professional gambler friends. One tours around playing poker. He studies and only plays against casual people, he was describing how if he can tell someone is a professional he will move tables. The other is an options trader for a firm. They're both analysis based gambling. You have a hard job w tons of risk. That's all"
290,"I once received a piece from my best friend as a birthday present. It was a digital art-piece of myself as a character in the steven universe world with all the characters. It's my favorite show, I cried, I love it. 

I would absolutely HATE a portrait of myself and it'd go straight in the attic never to be seen again if I received one. You end up looking like a self-absorbed asshole if you hang it up in the house. "
291,"&gt; I've been fluffy all my life so I know how to carry it and look 50 pounds lighter than I am.

Most overweight people think that, but it's not true.  Trust me, you look as big as you weigh, you're not tricking anyone."
292,"The person who first gave me an orgasm is not someone I respect or want to ever see again, and they are not special to me, and they are probably actually the worst lay I've ever had - me being able to come was more about my own internal journey with sex.

The person who I first slept with is also not someone I respect or want to ever see again, and the memory is traumatic.

You're trying to mind-read and you're assuming that these experiences she had make these people special, glorified, or better than you. They don't. Your insecurities and assumptions don't actually reflect how she or any other woman feels about her sexual past. It's extremely individual. Female virginity or female first-orgasm are not magically more special than their male counterparts just because the experience is different."
293,[deleted]
294,"Yeah, I wondered the same thing. Looks like OP can maybe relate to people who lie about their relationships in a context where it seems like it shouldn't matter."
295,"Finding a job may take weeks, so prepare yourself for that.  However, that doesn't mean you can just search here and there in your free time.  Search anytime your husband is gone and your kid is occupied.  Indeed.com is a good place to start.  I've had lots of luck getting interviews off that site.

Brush up your resume.  Be honest, but don't hesitate to be creative with wording.  

I would be more than happy to help you with a cover letter and resume.  PM me if you want to."
296,"I'm pretty sure he knows it's not okay and that's why he doesn't ""let"" you talk to others about your relationship. "
297,"It's just that we have steak tartare (or whatever) *every* night. 

I'm not really a food person. I like good tasting food, I like trying new things. But there are many nights when I just want to eat because if I don't I'll be hungry. I don't want it to be an event. Steak tartare isn't exactly something that you stand over the kitchen sink eating before moving on to the rest of your evening.

I'll try asking him to cook specific things...I just don't know how receptive he'll be. He loves to cook intricate things and I love that he has something he enjoys so much. I just want some plain food sometimes."
298,"You are having an emotional affair with someone who may not feel the same way about you... It sounds like B wants to stay with his girlfriend to me.

Regardless, out of respect for your boyfriend at the very least you should break up with him. He needs to be with someone who truly loves him and doesn't even consider cheating on him/ leaving him to be with someone else."
299,This is something I couldn't be okay with in a relationship. It would hurt but I think I would need to leave. Your last sentence says it all for me. 
300,It's also OK to tell them you're not running a hotel or car service. And for all they know you might be working on January.

302,"Waist measurement is my go-to. I've been in a room with someone exactly the same weight as me but two sizes different, just because of fat/muscle. It's why people often start intense diets and give up - they try and try, but the scale says a similar number. Waist measurement, as well as measuring dress size, is a good indicator of health risk too. :)


Yeah! It sounds like he was a bit of a jerk about things, but he might feel like you're allocating a huge proportion of your waking hours to something he's completely uninvolved in. 


Also some gentle reminders about how attracted to him you are would be good. There is that old stereotype that people get hotter when they're cheating/about to leave their partner (similar to ""you got me flowers? **Who is she?!?!**"" )"
303,"A snicker bat has twice as much sugar than a large Apple.  The sugar eaten as a whole fruit is also more slowly digested than chocolate leading to a lower insulin spike. 

There is a difference of eating fruit, or using it as a excuse to eat something, like your Jamba juice example ""it's healthy, it has fruit in it!"" 
Eating fruit is almost always good for you.
Other common flaws is the thinking that the healthy fruit cancels out unhealthy food. Or drinking fruit juice as a healthy replacement for soda.
"
304,"You need to trust your instincts, especially because you have no idea how he'll react if you don't have blonde kids.  Is his ignorance of genetics going to make him think you are cheating on him?"
305,"&gt;Joke option:  Bake a cake for him to take to work, write 'OP MADE THIS AND ALL THE OTHER STUFF, OP'S BF CANNOT COOK' in icing on top.  Put it in a well-sealed cake box so he can't scope it out before bringing it in.

Or keep the innocence card in your pocket and write ""LOVE YOU LOTS BF'S NAME. BF IS THE GREATEST EVER"" keep it complimentary so he looks like a douche if he says he did it himself."
306,"Nothing was your fault. Arguably, there could have been smarter ways to handle it--like telling him firmly that he's making you uncomfortable and needs to stop--but that doesn't make it your *fault*. It's 100% Rob's fault.

Anyway, I recommend texting him something like ""Rob, you made me really uncomfortable last night with your creepy behavior. Please leave me alone from now on."" Don't bother to explain why his behavior wasn't okay, and don't let him drag you into a debate with his excuses. Draw your boundaries clearly, stay firm on them, and move on."
307,"She knows she isn't pretty which is why she wants validation from only applying to ""pretty"" jobs. 
"
308,"Chances are they trash talk you too. I usually do massive topic changers when I'm with people who're discussing other people. If that doesn't work I usually do the oblivious me routine for older people I can't offend. *""Oh, I hadn't noticed. No, haven't seen her do anything like that. Hmm, if that's what you think. I don't know.""* I usually walk out of the room as soon as I can. And most importantly stop venting to them as well. I flat out tell people I'm not interested in talking about other people. I don't trash talk anyone so they know I'm serious."
309,WOW. That is an inspiring (but sad) story. Great job on making your way out of the ground to the top of the world. They deserve none of your money or attention and you shouldn't feel obligated in any way.
310,"Exactly.

Why have a big party where a lot of people will be there to apply pressure en masse.  I would take the party money and plan a getaway for the two of them.  "
311,"I'm sorry I probably shouldn't feel this way but,"" boohoo"". He doesn't like condoms? That's his best defense really? I imagine you won't like having a high risk pregnancy, possibly struggling to conceive , or having to wait even longer for your body to regulate which can result in miscarriages before you actually get a fertilized egg to stick. I just don't have much pity for a guy whose greatest argument is ""condoms don't feel great"" when it's weighed against his SO's very serious health conditions. 

You've been extremely reasonable so far, OP and trying to compromise. He needs to start talking about whatever his real problem is because I'm sorry but not liking condoms isn't enough of a reason to discourage your SO from having a healthier way of getting pregnant when her health is already going to be a risk issue. "
312,"Seriously, I hope OP really sees this. **THIS IS NOT WHAT PARTNERS DO, OP**. *Partners* watch out for each other, *partners* don't say shit like ""Oh I'll totally buy you dinner because that's a gift (presumably at at restaurant HE likes) but that whole lunch thing, since I'm not there, I don't care to hear about it"". Good lord."
313,I have read your post multiple times and was actually *confused* as to what you did to them. Like I thought you missed a paragraph or something. 
314,"My jaw dropped when I read this - these people are toxic and their behavior will only get worse with even the slightest concession or possibility of influence.  Your ""debt,"" not that it ever existed, is paid - cut them out! "

Thank you."
317,"this is some Cinderella bullshit. I wonder how long the dad and stepmother have been together. 

she has him by the balls. also this is huge disincentive to spend time with the family. "
318,Her husband PULLED A KNIFE. Why is everyone glossing over that? This isn't a simple case of letting him calm down. 
319,"Even if she never chokes you, what if she loses her temper one night and shakes your baby? "
320,"My boyfriend called me ""the chick from Frozen that turns everything to ice"" when I put my little ice-block hands on him the other night. Fwiw, he's much larger than I am and runs super hot compared to me but so did my skinny ex; I just have terrible circulation :P"
321,"Yea, actually, imagine if the woman in this story was your daughter. What would you tell her for advice?"
322,"First of all, don't kid yourself with this whole idea of ""going on a break,"" because that's not going to happen in all likelihood. You need to either commit to the relationship or to being single; you can't have your cake and eat it too in this type of situation. I can't say what the right choice is for you  "
323,sounds like a bad idea to let them stay with you then. they're going to have to learn how to swim themselves. dont enable them.
324,"He wants to fuck some other girl that will fill the void in the relationship he has/had with you.

It's as bright as day. People only ask for ""breaks"" in relationships because they've found someone else to go fuck, but want to keep some poor soul around (you) as a backup/failsafe.

Do yourself a favor and learn how to live without him. This relationship is over."
325,Guys are no more all sleaze bags than all girls are trashy people who like to wreck families for fun.
326,Gross. I'd bail and try to co-parent the best I could if the kid is mine.  If it's not mine I'd bail and never speak with her again.
327,"Honestly, I think it is good that you stood up for yourself, and I would not be willing to apologize. I'd be willing to talk to him and explain that I am an adult and know the consequences of what I did, but I also wouldn't apologize."
328,"I also think you're being too hard on yourself. Hair lazer removal can also cause scarring, how would you want him to feel if you had gotten scarred by your own hair removal?"

If the cancer is indeed real then we have to give him credit where credit is due. He's the first person to make me feel bad for cancer."
330,"Hey, this might be it. After I realized I am ready to devote my life to this woman, I'm starting to get a little paranoid about getting ""caught"" in my initial deception like you said.

333,"&gt; I also know many of the regulars that attend my events and am considering doing some casual follow ups after the first event. If a few people said it was a disaster, I'd have leverage to go to my boss. She wouldn't have to know they were solicited opinions.

Actually, I think the better route might be to have THEM go to the boss/social media/file a formal complaint. Then it's not coming from you directly?"
334,"Not to mention, whoever took the order could have accidentally keyed in Ranch instead of Garlic. Hell, maybe the ranch packet got tossed in the box for garlic ones at the store. Any number of reasons, really. I delivered pizza for two years in college, people act like the delivery driver controls everything. Smh

If she has never snapped like this before and then runs off, she could be having a psychotic break. Idk, it's disturbing, to say the least. "
335,"This is what I HATE about this sub. They've been married forever and have basically grown kids,  have gone through life's up and downs. She stonewalls him when he tries to find out what is going on - he does what he needs to do to get to the bottom of it and you think she should bail because of a keylogger. That is so monumentally stupid and childish. That's the problem with asking people on the internet advice about deeply personal relationships. They aren't emotionally invested at all and throw out knee-jerk stuff that doesn't help anything. "
336,"I would seek advice from Leslie rather than Internet strangers.

A lot of people are trying to play this down (which is baffling to me bc r/relationship's response to mild internet flirting is usually ""screw the kids and your 20 year marriage, she's cheating, dump her""). I don't think that is the right response. He crossed a serious boundary. This was cheating. Usually I would advise you to tell your friend immediately.

However. She is pregnant. Stress can do serious harm to a fetus, and hormones can make a bad situation worse. Furthermore, John seems to be genuinely remorseful about his actions.

I would talk to Leslie, if you trust her enough. Leslie knows John, knows his character, and has a better idea of how it would impact his relationship with Hayden. Her advice would mean more than that of a bunch of people who don't actually know you."
337,I feel better reading that. Thanks.
338,I'm bound by HIPAA as an LCSW. Please do report her. People like that need to be weeded out of a field that gives them access to private health information. I've reported coworkers and damn well would report a medical professional about my own health information too. This is a reason people fear and put off/forgo treatment. It should not be. 
339,Because he wanted to know the answer.  You are waaaay overthinking this.
340,"But he did tell you though, only a day later, and of his own volition over FaceTime when he could be properly accountable instead of just sending a weedy text. You only had to wait a day. He probably felt ashamed and embarassed and very, very nervous about how you'd react.

It's normal to feel a little pissed off that he did it and that he didn't tell you at the time. But isn't it also a possibility that there wasn't a plan to do it ahead of time, and that it was a spontaneous decision that he didn't tell you about on the way as he knew that it would bother you and he (irresponsibly and quite thoughtlessly, but probably drunkly) got coaxed into doing by this older guy who he wanted to impress by going along? 

Talk to him about it. Don't go wild but explain exactly why it bothered you and that trust is dented. If he does it again and doesn't tell you THEN there's a problem, because you've explicitly told him that his behaviour this time made you uncomfortable."
341,Where did these damn onions come from?!
342,"CERN exists too.

344,"&gt;Your brother is being overtly controlling. Guardianship is about him making sure you take your mental health treatment seriously but it's not about him micromanaging your life.

Uh, no. Guardianship is the legal transferal of rights and decision-making capability from a person to another person. Guardianship literally is about managing someone's life. Her brother is effectively her parent now.

And on top of that, it sounds like OP *knows* that she'd be putting herself into a dangerous and unfamiliar situation."
345,"Yeah, did your wife have an appointment with her gyno? Could have been that they didn't see a heartbeat and sent her to get a D&amp;C.

Whether it was an elective abortion or not though, you guys need to talk NOW. I would knock and tell her you guys need to talk. If she won't open the door, call her parents and tell them she is having a breakdown and you guys need help, because she is."
346,"Who the fuck wakes up to 15 missed calls from an ""acquaintance"" who is just waiting outside your door and you let them in...

Fuck! Even if she didn't cheat he should dump her for being unbelievably stupid."

348,"Gunna assume this was we are in the ER. 

I wish you you both the best of luck. This is a turmoilous time and I think there's likely nothing you can say for the moment, just hold her hand and let you both deal with both your emotions until you have a snippet of reason back. 

I know you want answers but it won't matter if it's today or tommorow you get it. The action is done. Just hold each other till the worst of it is over. "
349,"I'm really off put by the seeming lack of empathy. Like she can't even conceptualize how the situation would make her guest feel. And can't come up with any compromise at all. 

It's just comment after comment of ""but but but MEEEE!!!!!"" "
350,Have another conversation with your brother and ask how all of this is going to work out in the years to come.
351,Honestly the post just looked like an excuse to trash the mother. I'm not on her side or anything because what she did was shitty but OP seems pretty immature himself.
352,"I am so sorry your mother reacted that way.  This is absolutely unacceptable and I wouldn't blame you if you went no contact.  If you don't go no contact yourself, maybe consider it for your kids until your mother earns your trust back.  As for the relationship between you and your mom, maybe showing your mother that you're not making the decision lightly and have resources to help you, will ease some of her fears.

What I would like to suggest is that you get into contact with people who have fostered or are fostering.  Talk to them and see what it's really like and see what they recommend for starting out.  You might even consider finding out what classes/certification/etc. is available to give you more tools to help.

While you do this, keep talking to your mother.  Remind her gently you're not making any rash decisions.  This must have been very hypothetical to her until you said you were doing it for certain.  Keep her updated with what you learn.  Above all, reinforce boundaries as necessary.  What she did was horrific.

Finally, I'm impressed that you are willing to open your home to a child who is in need.  Just be certain to set realistic expectations.  Most of the kids just need somewhere stable to recoup and get back on their feet.  Some, however, have severe behavioral and medical issues.  As a single mom, the burden will be all the heavier.  As a single mom with vulnerable children, the burden will be felt by them too.  You need to know what to do in the worst case scenario and make it clear to your kids that you will always have their back.

Beyond that, good luck.  You sound like you will be a great foster mom.

Edit:  I just read the reply post about your childcare situation.  Are we reading this incorrectly?  Or are you dependent on your mother and MIL to look after your kids?  If so, then I too am confused as to how you expect to foster.  Essentially you are asking your mother and MIL to foster *for you*.  I'd be a little upset too if I was your mother."
353,"Right?! He's clearly concerned for his mother, I don't think he's being cruel. He's grieving and likely trying to process his grief at the same time as he's trying to think of how best to support his mother. I don't see it as cruel, it's realistic."
354,"So, you want a big painting of yourself that you don't like looking at? I absolutely appreciate the time and effort but as a present that someone would actually want it's a bit out there."
355,"He's playing you and you're buying into it. I don't think you have trust issues, what you have is a partner you shouldn't trust. "
356,"Shit, you have one hell of a guy there.  Do try to manage the negativity, depression can happen, and quite often much more of it as you get closer, and farther from the date. 

Therapy, counselling, anything, just try not to say things that will ring in his head forever.  :/"
357,I know basic mechanics and for anything more involved I can afford to take it to the shop. Thanks for your concern but that really wasn't my question lol. 
358,"&gt; Every time we got back together, he was a renewed man.

Yeah, but how many renewals do you really need before you finally have to admit you're never going to finish the book and it's time to take it back to the library?  One leap of faith is understandable, if not necessarily wise.  A second is decidedly risky.  The pattern you're describing?  That's masochistic.  Why do you not feel like you deserve someone who's still questioning whether you're the one for him after seven years?  If he hasn't figured it out by now, what on earth could still happen that's going to change that?"
359,It's very controlling behavior and a big red flag. I'd run.

361,"&gt; I've been doing some major renovation in the kitchen, primarily for my boyfriend. *He bugged me for months to get started*

It sounds like the renovation was his idea, and she's putting in 5 hours a day on it. Least he could do is either help or at least clean up instead of just whining to her about it. "
362,"Overly emotional rant? Yes of course I'm overly emotional about it because I'm worried she'll get hurt and you've basically said I'm the problem. Fucking hell, it's like I'm a human being who has feelings, imagine that."

364,"That's not really making it look any better, lol."
365,"Not just dads. 

I was headbanging at a red light to Helter Skelter and my 13 year old daughter wanted to die. "
366,"You've got plenty of proof of her delusion for going forward. Now it's time to put the crazy genie back in the bottle and hit block. Yeah, it feels good to have your ego stroked by someone who hurt you, but you've got more important things to focus on- like the awesome future you're having without her in it."
367,"my perspective: you can't really just decide to be ""monogamish"" without seriously discussing what that will entail for both of you and then blame your wife for acting ""unethically"" by pursuing an outside relationship while not necessarily knowing how to communicate properly about it. maybe her communication skills aren't up to snuff because neither of you have been in poly relationships before, and these things are difficult to discuss even in functional monogamous relationships!

did you guys actually delineate what a poly relationship would look like for both of you, what both of your boundaries are, what both of you hoped to get out of it? it strikes me that you may not be the best communicator either, given that you hectored your wife to have a threesome with HER FRIEND (who propositioned you on the day of your wedding?! what?!) until she had to explicitly tell you to stop. that's a super reasonable thing for her to have been uncomfortable with, and many people in poly relationships avoid bringing close friends into the equation for that reason.

my feeling is that the two of you should immediately agree to STOP pursuing outside relationships for the interim until you figure out a way to ""do"" poly in a way that works for both of you. read some books. do some research. TALK TO EACH OTHER ABOUT EVERYTHING. ask each other questions. if she is invested in her relationship with you (and it sounds like she still is, if she is considering starting a family), then she should be amenable to taking a ""break"" for the sake of straightening out your relationship. that's not telling her to stop exploring her sexuality, it's asking her to prioritize your marriage and figure out how to explore her sexuality without causing massive collateral damage (and for you to figure that out, too).

good luck."
368,"Not if they're best friends. That means they both communicate with each other the most of all their contacts on Snapchat. It may not have been going on for a long time, but it's an affair, not a porn site."
369,"You sound very strong and intelligent. You can make a good life -- it won't be easy, but you can do it.

370,lol dude you got lit up.  put the morally reprehensible bit at the beginning next time.
371,"You could, depending on the state &amp; country. In the US some states require both parties to consent to a recording. Others only require one person to consent. I'm absolutely no expert, but I also don't think it's illegal to record someone just to play it back to them. It's illegal to share and inadmissible in court though. I think. Correct me if I'm wrong of course."

373,"Yes!!  Go!!!

See all the museums!  Sail down the Seine!  Tour the cathedrals!  Visit the Paris opera for the history if not the music!  Get a guided tour of Notre Dame!  Drink the wine!  Take selfies from the Eiffel tower!

Enjoy!  Embrace life!

This is what life is without him. WONDERFUL!!!!"
374,"I agree with commenters suggesting that you need to put your foot down and tell him to stop -- personal care and products like a Clarisonic (which is like an electric toothbrush for your face) are a fine place to draw a hard line. He's being very rude!

I *don't* agree that you should get him his own stuff, because the problem is, already, that he's taking advantage of your stuff and costing you a bunch of money (it doesn't matter if you can afford it or not, he's using up a pricey item without paying for it, so the solution is not paying for more things). He's a grown man, he can figure out where to order his own damn Clarisonic and some facewash and moisturizer.

Again: he's just being rude and lazy.

One thing I wanted to touch on was on his smell turning you off. So, I went to a girls school in my adolescence and we were all in the habit of wearing men's deodorant (why? I have no idea). While I didn't do it all the time, I continued keeping Old Spice around on and off through college. I met my now-fiancé at age 22 and after a few months or dating he mentioned that he really didn't love it when I smelled like a classic dude deodorant scent. I sulked about this for a minute, but after some brief consideration I realized I had to grow up -- my partner wasn't trying to control me or judge my life choices, he was just telling me the response he was having to a relatively minor thing that I just wasn't thinking about. So I stopped using Old Spice! It was fine! He was happier not having me suddenly smell like a men's locker room on random days! Shit like this is squarely in the realm of ""a normal thing partners should be able to discuss."" 

Also, he is basically accusing you of Lysistrata-ing him to protest his use of your skincare products, which must be horribly frustrating to you -- but also I hope someday you can look back on that claim and find it at least mildly humorous. 

What's not hilarious is that he's not willing to listen to you when you say ""hey the fact that you smell like my grandma is not sexy,"" and he has an easy fix that would also involve being minimally considerate to you. "
375,"He's pointing out the age difference because here, it could matter.  If she graduated at 22 and already has a good job, savings and is debt free it says a lot about her.  If you got out of school 10 years ago, still have $30k in student loans despite making the same as her, it also speaks a lot to priorities.  Age here matters because it possibly indicates a time lapse.  You've (probably) had more time to accomplish what she has and have failed to do so."
376,"""Boyfriend, we've been seriously dating for nearly two years now and all I see in my future is a man who goes to work and comes home to play video games. You do not have to work much, but spending all of your morning, afternoon, and evening on a videogame is excessive. You are gradually losing the respect I have for you. I expect you as my committed partner to be continuously making improvements to your life for your and my benefit so that in the future we may be financially stable and mature enough to start a family. I understand we are young but you have yet to show any qualities as a father other than gaming and working once a week, it turns me off. You can continue your gaming habits because it is your day, but just know that this is how I am feeling about your excessive gaming."""
377,You are abusive and controlling. You shouldn't be in a relationship if you can't help but hit someone you claim to love. Please get professional help.
378,"No, no. What's happening is that you love her, but you aren't willing to curb YOUR spending habits in order to save for a future for the two of you. YOUR spending habits/financial management (or whatever it is that has prevented you from paying off your debt and saving for a house on ~$70k salary) are getting in the way here. If all you care about is love, then it should be a no brainer to cut out whatever you're wasting all your money on, in order to be a compatible marriage partner with her. Why are you so unwilling to budge on the finances, if money doesn't matter to you?"
379,"&gt; He said as soon as I deserve it, and become a good mother he would

Sounds like he's abusive. "
380,"I'm 22 and have two kids. Whatcha tryin' to say?! 

In all seriousness, it's not that unusual to have kids young. "
381,"Do you believe that your likely to get a confession / explanation, or just denial?
At the moment you seem pretty convinced by the video evidence...so I'd suggest that you decide what ultimately would be your decision based on the premise that it was, and prepare accordingly. "
382,"It would ~~seriously damage~~ end the friendship.

FTFY. "
383,[deleted]
384,"&gt; Yes, if it comes down to it of course Id choose my parents. That doesnt mean her viewpoint isn't important. Im willing to discuss and try to compromise, but if she hits me with an ultimatum....
&gt; 

**You're marrying her**. It's not ""of course I'd choose my parents"".  Them moving in aside, that is some serious mama's boy stuff."
385,Married couple in 30s. Lol. Im late 30s divorcing after 15 years. Yea. I wouldnt take that couple serious
386,"OP is clearly appalled by this idea- she should not be with a person who would even entertain it. How could someone misread their own relationship so much to even suggest this?


If I had a ""free week"" before my wedding, I think my fiancé and I would skip work and binge watch shows we are behind on and eat junk food. That's the worst I could think of doing. Why would anyone ready to begin a new life together want to have sex and do drugs like they're teenagers?? "
387,I've told her I'm seeing a therapist and she even expressed willingness to talk to him if that would help with my therapy (because she's just that wonderful and amazing). I'm taking a short trip home in November for work and will bring this up in person then rather than the grand romantic gesture thing I think. 
388,Good advice... And we need an update on what the d-bag says. 
389,"This must be reported, OP, otherwise they will do it again. "
390,"Your parents clearly have issues with money. They made terrible financial decisions by taking on a huge mortgage and making no savings. Where is their retirement? Who takes on a mortgage that lasts into their 60's? $52,000 in credit card debt? How does that happen to a family earning $180,000 a year? Don't take on their debt. If anything, you could pay them a small amount of rent but that is all you owe them."
391,"I don't really know? He's been getting more agitated today and he asked me if he bought me a puppy if I'd stay with him. I got a sinking feeling in my stomach and told him no and he asked even if he got us a Peach of our own (Julien's Italian greyhound). I told him no again. 

He's made noises about getting rid of my cats because J&amp;J don't have cats and asking me if I'll go vegan. He gets upset but not raising his voice or super angry, just saying he doesn't understand why I won't do this for him. "
392,"His situation isn't solely driven by his living situation and proximity to his mother. He has always had the ability to say no to her, but he doesn't exercise it. 

If I'm being really honest, I wouldn't advise this for a few reasons (3 months is not, for example). But it is your choice and if you decide to go this route, I would make a condition of this living situation that he cannot help his mom at all anymore. I worry that this situation will end with him still breaking his back for her, but now you're paying to support him instead of her. "
393,"&gt; Oh I guess another useful detail is that before I agreed to go on the trip, I had talked to her about my Zika worries. But she has been to malaria prone countries before and never been bit, thanks to copious use of bug spray, so she believes that mosquito-borne illnesses are preventable if you're vigilant. She told me that I didn't have to go if I didn't want to. I did agree to go anyway, but that was before I read more about Zika which eventually led to me pulling out of the trip.

I backed out of a trip to the grocery store because I'm worried about getting hit by a car.

Oh I guess another useful detail is that before I agreed to go on the trip, I had talked to her about my car worries. But she has crossed busy streets before and never been hit, thanks to copious use of crosswalks, so she believes that automobile fatalities are preventable if you're vigilant. She told me that I didn't have to go if I didn't want to. I did agree to go anyway, but that was before I read more about car accidents which eventually led to me pulling out of the trip."
394,"Suggest proportional to income.

EDIT: and don't take 'no' for an answer."
395,"Maybe you should say you want to meet her. Figure out something you can all do together. If he seems uncomfortable &amp; wants to keep you separated, that might be a bad sign. "
396,He loved that thing. Partly I didn't realize how much. I allowed him to bring it into our kitchen because we were army and living off base in a second floor apartment and he wanted to be able to work on it and fully customize it. I didn't mind but the shower incident did take me by surprise haha. I will never forget being so livid in my life until I opened that curtain. His face was also pretty priceless of shock and shame. But meh now I laugh at it. Men are funny creatures sometimes I feel.

398,"You aren't out of line, your husband sounds really inconsiderate. "
399,"Well, a 13 year old I went to school with got knocked up by her boyfriend. Some kids are sexually active at that age. "
400,"So you're cheating on your boyfriend and you're not sure if you should tell him...?

Tell him and let him have a chance to find a faithful girlfriend."
401,"You'd be surprised. 

There was a post on here awhile back from a black woman who realized her boyfriend was a white supremacist. 

Sometimes people's ideologies conflict with what they're attracted to. 

Probably why so many of the most homophobic people are revealed to be gay themselves. "
402,"If he were a reasonable person, and they were together longer...maybe.

But here's the problem. 

Only together seven months.

Was fine with her surfing until he met her friends, and THEN started with the fear and guilt trippy language. Complained about feeling 'emasuclated' and strongly implying it was her fault and it would go away if she just didn't go surfing. 

And then gave her the cold shoulder for an entire day when she didn't just bow down to his ridiculous demands.

IMO, there is too much here for her to bother on such a short relationship. By now, she's starting to learn the real him now that they've been together long enough for him to relax and not try to put his best foot forward. "
403,"That's absolutely not true for every condition. For example, if a first degree relative has had a pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs) then the risk is much higher and then they shouldn't go on oestrogen containing birth control as the risk is quite dangerous. It can change management of things and often certain tests won't be done without a relative family history because of what a risk factor it can be."
404,"&gt; Honestly if I were in your position that is not something I would be able to forgive.

Same. It made me nauseated to even read that, let alone to live that. What. the. fuck. "
405,"One of my tattooist said that if they are adamant that they want a tattoo     that represents their love he advises them to go for star signs they are a way of showing your attachment but if it falls apart you have a nice tattoo of a lion, archer whatever and no need to explain too a new partner why you have a exes name on your ass."
406,The best path for her is the one that she chooses and that makes her happy.
407,"You can certainly forgive her, whether you let her back in your life depends on you. It is possible you have outgrown the friendship, you are an adult now. Or you could renew the friendship cautiously. If you already have a few good friends keep in mind your time committments to them. Basically I am saying if you let her back in your life she has to earn your trust."
408,"Dawn dish soap and a bit of baking soda.  Do this 2-3 times in a row.  Your hair will feel gross and crispy.  Wring out hair, and apply your favorite deep conditioner.  Leave in for at least 20 minutes, I like to keep it up in a shower cap, with a hot towel over the cap.  Layer conditioners if you want.  

 Rinse with as cold of water that you can handle.  Saturate hair with apple cider vinegar. Leave in for about 10 minutes, rinse *thoroughly* with cold water.  Work a quarter size of conditioner into hair, do not rinse.  Avoid heat styling for a bit.  Deep condition every 3-4 shampoos for a few weeks.

This should wash most of the color out.  Source:  hair stylist who used to color her fried, bleached hair stupid colors and hating it every time."
409,"I think more specifically, she's embarrassed and insecure. She is, according to OP, pretty and fun. She hooked up with Jack and probably thought they were going to be a thing after that. Instead, he was like ""ahhhhh nope"" and started dating some other girl (who hadn't even blown him! /s) a week later. 

I'm not saying it's sensical, but she's probably feeling like ""oh my God, I'm good enough to fuck but not to date?"", and it's manifesting in this weird compulsion to make it seem like OP is just a fellow blowjob provider, rather than the girl who was picked as girlfriend. "

411,"No, he doesn't have Alzheimer's. This was 20+ years ago. He's still coherent. When we go out to eat now, he just wants to flirt with the waitresses, which... ugh, ok. A little embarrassing, but nowhere near the level of mortification we felt when he was screaming at them.

I agree this could be a sign of onset of Alzheimer's or dementia. Because I moved away, I wasn't privy to however my dad got over it. My mom might have told him to go see a doctor. He might have gotten counseling. I don't think he was medicated, but I can't say for sure he wasn't. "
412,"At some point, it becomes both impractical and unreasonable to put on more clothing.  They're not battling it out over ""way to warm"" and ""a bit too cool"" here, he's turning the AC down lower than most houses keep the heat turned on in the winter.  

My husband would love it if the house were 65 year round and I'd love it if it were 80 year round.  We're both miserable at the other's idea temperatures.  The solution was not for me to wear winter indoor clothing year round so that he has the perfect temperature, it was for the two of us to find temperatures we can both live with (68-72 in the winter, 74-78 in the summer) and then we both make minor adjustments to our clothing so that we're more comfortable.  And yeah, we have an electric blanket but running it in August while the AC is set to 60 would be absurdly expensive and unreasonable."

415,"You're right that it's immature and a terrible idea! She has to slow down trying to rush marriage &amp; children!

At some point you have to think if her mindset will change. If she's really keen on this whole ""ready to grow up thing"".. then I would say you're not compatible and should break up. Then maybe she'll find someone who wants the same things as she does."
416,"&gt; You know, it's really not that expensive to raise a baby!""

Doctor bills alone are pricey. So you're spending money even before the baby is born. Then of course you're (general you not specific you) assuming that the baby will be born healthy with no medical problems that would cost money and/or require a parent to stop working for a time. Does the kid need glasses? Braces? Did he/she break their arm? More bills!"
417,"Oh ok, well that sounds like a definite 45+ BMI with a very rough calculation. Not that it is always an excellent indicator, but you can get a moderate idea of where you stand.

418,"I just recently started spending time socializing cats at an animal shelter and it's great for seeing some animals, improving their day is good for my mood, and it helps me socialize and make friends with people. I think it would be great for her. "
419,"&gt; She claims that she has only contacted him when we were having problems with me not communicating with her.

One does not simply contact a hook-up whom they had cheated with, on their partner.

&gt; I always had this nagging feeling of something more than what she was telling me

Combined with the ""now exposed"" lies, that nagging feeling is not going away anytime soon.

&gt; So I suppose as a way of preventing myself from getting too hurt, I didn't fully open up to her until recently.

Then she dropped the bomb.

As you are providing us more details the cons are outweighing the pros."
420,For clarity those hours are including commuting.
421,"Yeah fersure! As long as something doesn't have a warning to not use it for that purpose, you totally can, and won't end up in the hospital. I think that's how that works."
422,"There's a reason friends can say things to each other that they wouldn't say to people they're just meeting.  

I'm sure your mother's blunt sarcasm is a hit with her family and friends, but your GF doesn't know her and I'm sure is nervous about making a good impression.  

Your mother needs to work on ""polite and social"" when getting to know your GF.  If the relationship progresses, it'll allow each of them to get to know the other's personality.    "
423,"This so much.  My Dad gave me $2,200.00 to help with rent while I was in law school. I tried to give him a check to pay it back, since I thought he went above and beyond in helping me out, and I can afford it now. 

His response was ""I don't want that money, I gave it to you to help when you needed it, and you never asked for it. I want you to do the same for your kids one day.""

When he wouldn't accept it, I turned around and put it in my girls' college savings accounts, so I can one day do exactly what he wants.  This is how a parent acts.  "
424,So glad to learn HIV isn't transmitted sexually through bodily fluids and mucous membranes.
425,"&gt;""She told me she was conditioning it and instead dyed it a completely different color without discussing it with me first.""

Don't forget to add that she had previously told her friend she could never have her hair dyed that color for work reason. Her friend knew she wanted it but also knew why she didn't consider getting it done herself, and it wasnt because of cold feet - it was for her damn job! "
426,"Absolutely true.  I knew him just before he became famous, and when he made 'sexiest man of the year' etc, I killed myself laughing.  So funny to think of him in that way, because he was such a dork - a lovely sweet guy - but yeah, not a sex symbol.  I think Deb appeals to him because she's as down to earth as you can get and would provide fabulous emotional stability.  He is not gay. 
"
427,"There's other options aside from Accutane.

I'm on birth control for PCOS/endometriosis, which have a lovely side effect of horrific acne on my cheeks and neck. I also take Spironolactone, which is just a common blood pressure pill that can help with hormonal acne. Now instead of having my cheeks/neck covered, I mostly get one or two bigger zits on my chin if I don't keep up with washing my sheets. 

There's also creams and other pill forms (usually antibiotics, but these aren't longer treatments). Send her over to r/skincareaddiction or find some local dermatologists. Or both. There's also ways to help keep your face clean, like wiping down your phone regularly, switching pillow cases often, and washing your sheets once or twice a week regularly. "

432,I was a bridesmaid for a really good friend in a similar situation. Her dad showed up on wedding day and the wedding planner directed him while us bridesmaids stood guard outside the brides dressing room. He never saw or talked to her before the wedding. When the ceremony started the wedding planner directed the dad to walk down the aisle in the beginning with some other family members and sat him down and then she walked down the aisle afterwards by herself.  There was no communication about it before hand because she wanted to avoid drama. 
433,"Sorry for what you're going through.  Apartment hunting in NYC is tough, and even tougher if your roommates are unreliable.  That said, if they were already making decisions on your behalf, you probably dodged a bullet by not agreeing to it.  (Especially since subletting is a whole other power dynamic than being a roommate.)"
434,"Trading up eh?  So here's my recommendation.  Ignore dude number 2 and decide if you want to stay with your boyfriend on his own merits.  Ask yourself if you're content where you're at, not whether there's something better out there.  Chasing the bigger better thing is a recipe for unhappiness.

435,Yeah it always ends in the most reasonable person getting screwed over because they're the person that the non-confrontational person can control.
436,"Totally this. To not brush your teeth or to not floss is disgusting. Food gets trapped in between those tiny spaces between your teeth and is basically rotting away in your mouth. 

It is so so so sooooo foul!"

439,"Get your wife back into therapy, probably solo but its not bad to do that together. She needs to build some backbone.

And you could also think about comparing this situation with your own ( future ) kids. Would she want the kids raised in the same way? With the same values as her siblings? I doubt she would want her kids to turn out the same. So you two need to practise on her siblings :)"
440,From the text it doesn't seem like OP has been reacting in this way. It seems he rather tries to find solutions to the problems. Helping your child when their feelings are hurt is not the same as removing all obstacles from their path. 
441,"&gt;I was vastly more mature than other girls

Lol! We've heard this line here so so many times here..."
442,Holy god I hope you never get one. Always pee after sex!
443,Have you reported her yet? 
444,"Kill 'em both, let God sort it out, amirite?
/s"
445,"I know, but I feel like if I just say ""my body, no child"" it's goong to potentially end our marriage. I just don't know how to talk to him without either of us letting out emotions get in the way?"
446,"I have no desire to make a judgment call on this.  At no point did I say whether she is right or wrong in her actions, I just described what seems to be the most reasonable place she is thinking from.  

I do disagree that he is suddenly the wronged party because she didn't want to go to counseling.  If her issues in the relationship were ""Get a damn job"" then how much deeper can a therapist help her dig into her feelings?  Maybe she is evil, maybe he is a lazy sack.  We can not know from his post.

EDIT: First sentence, second paragraph for clarity."
447,"Keep in mind that they might be bullying you into getting a gf. 

I'm not going to go into detail of how wrong they are being and on how many levels, but they are wrong no matter what they mean by this. 

One thing you could try to do for now, is to ignore them or make a lame joke back.

""I would have a gf, but I couldn't handle disappointing so many women by taking myself of the market""

""You know what, that's a great idea, I'm going to start a family next week, wouldn't you love raising another set of kids here mom.""

I'm sure you could find a few things to say that wouldn't offend your family too much, but show you're not going to let them get to you. "
448,"I was planning a vow renewal ceremony, and the person I wanted by my side was my cousin, ravaged by ALS, in a wheelchair with a bi-pap mask and a brace to hold her neck in place.  She died before I could do it, but, the way she looked on the exterior never entered into my considerations.  The OP's fiance would probably have a seizure if he saw something like that, and this thought makes me very happy."
449,You're right.  The age gap isn't a problem at all.  /s
450,"Unfortunately they know. We shared our good news in happier times. He even offered them some, which they declined. We don't plan on telling them when we actually get it in the bank. We have told them on many occasions that it's essentially gone once we get it."
451,If he doesn't have to pay for it he doesn't care apparently.
452,"Yes, you said some hurtful things but to lash out like that is never okay."
453,"&gt; but her every action has shown that neither you nor the marriage is a priority for her.

This is the key here.  There are a plenty of euphemisms for it, ""words are cheap... actions speak louder than words"" and so on.  They are all true, and they are so commonly ignored."
454,I've never seen it actually happen and I've worked with some pretty shitty stab-you-in-the-back-with-a-smile personalities. But I'm sure it exists for some people. 
455,"This is a possibility, but the yellow heart emoji thing (and the likelihood that this is an actual person known by the husband personally) cuts against that notion.

It seems that the likely possibilities are: a horribly inappropriate, unintended snap (meant for someone else); sexting only; or the absolute worst possibility of physical cheating."
456,"Yeah, this guy is a piece of work.

You aptly nicknamed him boy, OP! A real man would not have such an immature view of how relationships work. There is give and take. Not just him having his way, regardless of your long held plans for post-school life!"
457,"He could have just said ""she's black"", it was the time he spent describing her body that made him sound like a creeper"
458,"I was gonna say this.  It wouldn't make a whole lot of sense to either remove the condoms from the packaging and take 'em with you because....well, yeah.  Also, if he did use them, why be careful enough to remove the condom from the package without just removing those wrappers?  That would almost seem like wanting them to be found.

I'd go with jerkin' the gerkin first before jumping to cheating."
459,wise words from /u/PM_TITS_OR_DONT
460,"I had a bf that would leave condoms under the bed when I was out of town. He would deny it and lie, even eventually claiming that he was cheating on me...ended up he was putting it on a dildo and shoving in his ass. After threatening to move out, he pulled out a dirty, used condom still attached to the dildo that he had thrown in a bag in a hurry.

Some people are REALLY embarrassed about their weird sex kinks."
461,Yeah I was like...what is this 1996? Guy needs a new routine. 
462,"That's the problem. He was repeatedly careless and DID NOT respect your advice. Will he do the same thing if you two have kids? 

"
463,Yeah. None of the issues you brought up were really addressed. Now that he has a job you guys should be putting more money into savings or paying off loans. He shouldn't be using all of his income just on himself. That is not how any healthy marriage works...
464,"$1200 a month isn't worth ""going after""."
465,"Also, how is the bride to be okay with the ex inviting an ex girlfriend? That's odd to me."
466,"&gt; It's not going to stay that way, you know, with the baby and all.

heh

OP, congrats! And apparently it's rather common for a woman's first reaction to finding out that she's pregnant to be fear and regret, even when they were actually trying for a baby. Growing a human is scary stuff - so it's not that unusual! Good luck with everything! "
467,"Hi, I'm so sorry you're going through this. Husband and I have been through the infertility mill. If they had come to me and said ""it's all on your husband,"" never, ever, ever in a million years would I have arrived at ""bang my buddy"" as a solution to our problem. Just...no!

Others have pointed out that a sperm bank is a much better choice and whatnot--I just wanted to give you a semi-similar perspective. Good luck to you; what she's asking is very unfair to you.

ETA:  In past posts of this nature on this sub, in some cases...the lady was already knocked up by the ""friend."" I truly hope that is not going on here."
468,"Well...all of her previous exes have had serious problems, too. I always looked at it as she's very kind, and people with issues are drawn to her, but maybe it's the other way round? 

I'm hopeful that I can get my lovely gf back soon, but if not then I probably do need to think about whether I'M drawn to people with issues, too, and bow out if I can't handle it. Ugh. "
469,"&gt; but why should I when I don't like her?

You don't even *know* her. 

&gt; but he says I am making him feel like he has to make a choice

....You are, though... "
470,"Is it possible, that the (fond) memories of him and his siblings kind of weighted out ^(or steamrolled... sorry couldn't resist...) the reality with you by his side? 

Btw, my sleep is holy, I would have flipped out, too.
But I really think, that after sleeping over it, you can talk about what happened here like the adults that you are..."
471,"depending on school, some shitty school will punish BOTH of them, then the parents are going to destroy OP"
472,"OP was very upfront about wanting her values to match those of her SO. The reason a lot of guys have been steamrolled for having similar preferences is their reasons: a lot of them are uncomfortable with the idea of being compared to previous partners, or they want a virgin bride even though they themselves have had sex before, or they're being possessive and jealous about guys their girlfriends were with before they had even met. The motivation makes a difference.  "
473,"OP, you have to tell him. My dad died at 50 two years ago and I didn't have my boyfriend - I had my siblings, but I made sure my sisters fiancé looked after her and my mum looked after my younger brother. But I digress. 

I still break down all the time. My dad was my best friend and I lost him. I met my boyfriend two weeks after my dad died, and even though he wasn't with me throughout the funeral or through the first few months - he is always there for me when I need to cry or scream. If he won't let you do that, that's not fair to you. Because you probably won't ever stop grieving: I know I won't. 

Please tell him. Keeping it in can definitely make things worse for your mental and physical health. "
474,"IF she did it just for herself.... she still should have said something. And maybe chosen someone else to take the photos. A professional boudoir session. Not some sketchy ""friend who takes photos"" buy. If she had gotten it done by a stranger, and they were just for her to feel sexy, no. Not a problem. But BECAUSE she had them taken by a ""friend"", and didn't say anything to her BF about having them done, then yeah, that crosses a line. "
475,"You don't have a girlfriend, bro, you have a FB or FwB who lives with you. She wants to keep you around because you address her need for security, but she's going to dump you when she finds another guy who will put up with her shit, and give her a place to live.

She doesn't respect you, and she doesn't respect herself. 

If you want another option besides dumping her, you could always start dating other women on the side. It seems she's okay with dating while in a relationship, and if she complains, just tell her 'you meet a lot of lonely women'. 

I wouldn't do that, though, unless you want a roommate more than you want a GF. My advice: Dump her, and move on to bigger and better things. "
476,Tbh it just sounds like she is after a green card and you are the only American man she knows.
477,"Don't ""talk to your brother about his behavior"", just *talk to your brother as his little sister*.

Ask him if he's ok. Ask him what's going on. Tell him you are very concerned about him. 

Don't relay messages from other family members, or ""try and talk some sense into him"". 

Also, don't recite the conversation back to your family. If he really is on bad terms with them, that could be a betrayal of his trust in you. Might be worthwhile to explicitly ask, ""what would you like me to say to mom/dad?"""
478,"Absolutely correct. I contacted a good lawyer friend of mine and he said we are legally powerless right now to do anything. The only thing we can do, and will do, is send a legal note stating that she is not welcome to contact us in any possible way, and that more action will be taken if she does. The lawyer said that if she goes against our request, then we can start talking about harassment, but even then we are not able to do much, mostly because we are living in 2 different countries. However, we could then have enough proof to contact the Internet Crime department of the Police and the Hellenic Post Office (although we are already working on something with the post office).

Thank you for your reply! Gonna go get dressed now to meet my lovely wife, hopefully everything goes as planned!"
479,"&gt;The other - well, her house sure was nice and clean. And empty.

I think you missed the point,  this is what OP wants lol. "
480,Thanks.
481,"With a card that says, ""You'll be dead soon."""
482,"In addition to the big fat pile of ""nos"" you have here, why did you even think that would work? Most women I know have a ""girl code"" of not fucking their friends ex's."
483,"He's an asshole. For a start, 63 kg and average height is a totally normal and healthy weight. And even if you were overweight or gaining rapidly, he's approaching it in a controlling manner and making it all about himself.

&gt; I was quite a confident woman before, but since then I can't look at myself and my body in the mirror anymore.

That says it all. :(

I suggest you find someone who appreciates your body the way it is. There are billions of guys who find your body type hot, so don't waste your time on this idiot. "
484,I do think so. My wife knows more about this than I but I also believe that her sister would only want to give the baby up for adoption if it went to us.
485,"I think this is why any time I got into an argument with my exes, and they'd reflexively ball their fists, I'd automatically feel nervous."
486,"No, you should change your boyfriend."
487,"I mean, I'm Autistic and both asexual/sex repulsed. We're still all different people with many different attitudes towards sex and physical contact, which I think is the main point.

Honestly the original thread was a big mess about this. There were too many people acting like OP saying his GF might be Autistic was some kind of terrible insult. It's not. There's nothing wrong with it and sensory issues DO affect stuff like this sometimes."
488,"Unfortunately I agree that this is what seems to have happened.

OP your wife is hurting right now. Just be there for her. She will lash out but she doesn't really mean it!"
489,Yes but OP doesn't want anything that requires her to compromise at all so it's not like the idea of paying for childcare is going to be the thing that tips the scales here

491,"I think it's a bad sign that he can't even apologize for what he said. It wasn't an ""I'm sorry, I didn't mean it"" situation. He told her after he'd cooled down that he *meant* what he said. "
492,"Also: making 50,000/year isn't a respectable salary for a 26-year-old? I suppose it depends on where you're located. My husband can support our growing family on that if I were to lose my job."
493,"To add to this, even if it's not strength training, just find a form of exercise that you enjoy. The gym is not everyone's cup of tea, so you could take up a team sport or something that you can do together with your girlfriend, like badminton. People fail at getting fit because it feels like a chore, so find something that doesn't. "
494,"Why are you deciding in advance to be grumpy? Why can't you focus on the positives, like the fact that your sister is in love and making a huge commitment and wants you to be part of it?"
495,"&gt; I'm just worried I'd do something weird/offensive because I don't have a filter and just do things

496,"Just going to hop onto the top comment. It sounds like she's getting Lupron injections to treat her endometriosis, and all of your wife's symptoms are potential adverse effects (nausea/vomiting/night sweats) from treatment with a GnRH analog. However, it sounds like she's experiencing much more severe side effects, because she's certainly not ""fine"" as her physician said. It could just be from the Lupron, or, given her medical history, it could be a combination of all of her other medical issues. My advice for you is to encourage her to be more vocal about every single symptom she's having at her next appointment so that she and her physician can reevaluate her treatment plan.     


Source: **not** a doctor, but a third year medical student that just finished their OB/GYN clerkship. Take everything I said with a grain of salt, but it's never bad advice to encourage more open communication with your doctor! It's *her* body and *her* health."
497,"She said he was skipping work for it, so I'd imagine chronic would be a good word."
498,DUDE. There are going to be times when you fuck up. But you NEED to get out of the mentality where if you make a mistake you might as well keep backsliding. A mistake is cool. A days worth of mistake is no big deal. But get right back in it.

500,"If her company is completely unhelpful here, it might be time to find a new job.

And report this to the police. Even if her complaint goes nowhere, there will be a record of it if this guy continues to harass women. Which he will, guaranteed. 

YOU stay put. This is out of your hands. You're not her parent. Ask her what she wants from you and support her, but you cannot fight this battle for her. Just hug her and let her know you're in her corner. That alone will help."

502,"Are you fucking shitting me?  His own family?  They would ALL be dead to me over this if I were in his shoes.

It sort of reminds me of a post from a while back where a guy had his fiance cheat on him with his childhood friend, his parents knew about it and didn't tell him because ""he's like a son to us"", so he ghosted all of them, moved to another city, and restarted his life."
503,"He probably has cheated on you with her. Or tapped it before he hooked up with you. Either way, he's a dick and you deserve better. Time to move on and be done with his gaslighting BS. It's clear he will continue to prioritize her over you and no matter what you say- you're not just going to win. You'll have accept second place to this girl or just move on to a much better guy."
504,"You've clearly never worked as a waiter.  Good luck getting a restaurant to subsidize your wages if you are making under the minimum, especially when much of your tips are cash."
505,"I'm a black girl and while I am inclined to agree, she said in the last post ""you're white, you've never experienced real pain and struggle lol"" in response to a sad story of his. That's a completely inappropriate response. And honestly, while black people struggle more on average, that doesn't mean no white people have ever experienced real pain or struggle. "
506,"I think its maybe a self image/ego thing. She thinks of herself as pretty as she is, and its a big part of her self esteem. If she has treatment for the acne/plucks her eyebrows etc she is admitting to herself she is not pretty NOW also with the unobtainable jobs she is going for she is wanting them to take her on to validate to herself that she really is pretty as she is, and she is getting really upset when they wont ""play ball"" "
507,"Many places around the world have viruses that we don't have here, in the US. Is your advice to never travel outside your home? How long do you think Zika lasts. His girlfriend isn't pregnant either and presumably he doesn't have any pregnant sexual partners and won't for the next few weeks. Skipping a long-planned vacation to avoid a mild flu is...overly risk averse. He should be approximately as worried as he is when he crosses a busy street."

509,"So the multiple times she asked him what he wanted for his birthday, instead of bouncing between different activities, should have said something along the lines of ""I don't like to celebrate my birthday, please don't do anything for me."" Why is OP getting shit on for not reading his mind?

511,In some counties if you get a restraining order they can specifically include any pets in the restraining/stay away order.   This is different every where but worth looking into and asking about.   In my case I have a dog and made sure my dog was included in the restraining order.   In my case any time he violated the order if the dog was there or involved it would be a separate and additional charge.   It also protected me legally if he were to kidnap her or poison her (yes it's a crime to poison a pet even without the inclusion of them in a restraining order but having the documentation for it ahead of time makes it easier to pursue criminally)
512,"&gt;If I go to the police, and he shows that, I will look like a lier, and my reputation will be ruined.

They're counting on you believing this so that you won't go to the police. But you still should. There will be evidence supporting your side too. The *truth* is that he raped you, so there will be evidence that that was what happened. For example, it might be possible to prove, maybe from his phone activity, that he took you to that dangerous neighborhood.

Like others have said, go to a rape crisis org, where you will find trained advocates who can advise you on how to approach this on the legal front (and also help you get the resources you need to protect your emotional health going forward). Your situation isn't unique--rape by coercion is common, more common than violent rape--so they'll know what to do.

And Greg taping you in that situation without your consent was also a crime, so if he does show it to the police he'll be opening himself up for prosecution on that front.

I am so sorry that they did this to you. This was absolutely, 100% premeditated rape. It's the same as if Greg had put a gun to your head. You did the right thing, the smart thing, to protect your safety under the terrible circumstances they forced you into, so don't ever let anyone make you feel bad for it. "
513,"Yep. At first I was like ""Girl, don't complain!!"" But then I imagined feeling like I have to do everything myself &amp; Mr Moneybags over here walks in and just throws money at his chores &amp; I'd be like ""well shit I'd love a break now and then too, must be nice."" It isn't logical or fair maybe but at least I can see how she might feel that way. "
514,"I know.  Almost every response in these threads includes ""see a therapist"" or ""see a lawyer,"" even when it's completely unnecessary.  People always say ""well, it wouldn't hurt..."" but wasting several hundred dollars when it's neither necessary nor very helpful isn't really an option for most people.  (I'm thinking here of a post a few days ago where an ex-girlfriend in a different country was mailing pictures and things to the OP and his wife.  Almost everyone said they should get a lawyer, when there's nothing a lawyer could really do about someone *in another country*.  Throwing away a few hundred dollars on a lawyer who can't help the situation isn't a solution to their problem.)"
515,"Well there is this

&gt; Like, finding out that even after they broke up they couldn't make it more than 2 or 3 weeks without sleeping together again, and that pattern continued for years whenever they were both single. Or that he considers her the first true love of his life. Or how protective they are of each other.

If he told her they were ""friends"" without mentioning all of the above, that's lying by omission. And I spy at least two boundary transgressions in there too. "
516,"I feel like an old man, but I honestly don't understand why people donate to GoFundMe's when it's not something medical or emergency related (e.g. a flooded house).  If I'm going to help a service, I'd donate to them directly, not an individual.

For you, do you really care that people will think you're 'petty'? It's your money and you have all right to not donate it to your friend - I'd say regardless if she's using for unethical purposes."
517,Yeah this is fucking horrifying behavior. I'm so sorry OP.. If this were me I would follow /u/penguinzforever and /u/idontwanttostart's advice and remove myself from their lives as soon as possible. It takes a certain kind of evil in someone to be able to do something like this to a helpless house pet.

519,"Why did you lie about eating a hamburger? I mean, it's just so stupid to lie about it."
520,Sounds like he's using you as free childcare. Also sounds like he's not a great dad tbh
521,"OP, what are you doing in this relationship? I'm not one to immediately jump on the dump him boat but c'mon. 

He's not cutting contact with her because he doesn't *want* to. Even after everything she's done, he's decided that he still wants her in his life and he's screaming at you because he's resentful that you keep pushing him to cut her out. He wants to keep her around, even though he *knows* it hurts you and he's willing to lie to you to do it. He's not going to stop talking to her anytime soon and I wouldn't be surprised if he still has feelings for her. The fact that he added her back immediately after you broke up is a huge red flag that he doesn't see her as a problem, he sees you as a problem that's keeping him away from her. 

Where was he when she was posting all that stuff on her instagram? Because any partner worth their salt would have stood up for their partner, defended them and told their ex they were being wildly inappropriate. 

At the very least, y'all need counseling because this is not going to stop and it's incredibly worrying he's escalated to emotional abuse. That's a manipulative tactic: he wants you to learn to be quiet about his ex if you want him to be nice. He wants you and her. "
522,"My boyfriend has a dad that does a couple of these things. Tells long, rambling stories within stories. Makes inappropriate/uncomfortable jokes about women without seeming to realize that it's inappropriate. He actually has diagnosed social/mental disorders... Is that the issue with your dad?

I ask because, quite frankly, my boyfriend and I will sometimes tell his dad to stop when his dad goes too far, but his dad never seems to quite understand that he's doing anything wrong. A week or two will go by, and he'll say or do something else inappropriate, convinced that he's just being funny or sociable... So if that is the problem with your dad, talking it out might not work...

EDIT: And the way I handle it is just limiting how much I see him, but that's not really an option for you if you're living with the guy..."
523,"I'm reluctant to post on here as it is obvious he has found it (he's often talked about Reddit, guess I should have changed more of the story), but I think HR will have to be informed."
524,"To sum up multiple points in the post and the thread: 

You dated for a very brief period of time before marrying.  

You and your partner are both loud and aggressive when fighting, and you fight a lot. 

Your partner is far more social than you and spends more time cultivating relationships in your common circle of friends and acquaintances.  

The fights only get worse as you spend more time together.  

Your partner has finally escalated to physical violence, and your first reaction is to downplay and excuse the violent behavior to people outside of your relationship.  

*shrugs* 

It might be harder to see because OP's a man who has repeatedly said he's not physically afraid of his wife, but this...looks like the shape of a relationship with an abuser.  If one partner is abusive, marriage therapy is statistically unlikely to be helpful.  I might recommend OP see a counselor who's comfortable working with male victims of domestic violence.  That counselor is probably going to be best at providing emotional support and legal advice, at this point.  "
525,"I've been shoving things in my bum for quite some time and I've never experienced anything as intrusive as your work colleague, I'd contact the police."
526,"There was another poster here a while back with a very similar story.  Her update was the best part of it.  The update talked about how she moved out for a week, got a cheap hotel, and let the husband take care of his Mother all by himself so that he actually understood how difficult it was.  At that point, husband agreed that wife was right and they had to find a home for their mother.  They had her in her own room at a nice care facility within 30 days.  Has your husband ever been the one to take on the majority of the care requirements?

You can't handle this situation.  And you know what?  That is 110% okay.  There are paid professionals in dedicated facilities who know how to properly handle dementia patients because it is not easy.  It is HARD.  Your MIL needs to be in a home that can properly care for her, and you need your marriage back.  You are not a horrible person at all, this is simply more than you can handle."
527,"I had to put my sweet, 17-year-old kitty to sleep this week, and I wish I had one more day to do everything she loved and bring her happiness. Tell your BF to pound sand. "
528,"He could have contracted it in the last 2 weeks though, too. "
529,"Please do. You're not history's greatest monster but if you don't get a handle on this RIGHT NOW, you're in for a rough road. Also, please apologize to your brother and never lay hands on him again for any reason whatsoever."
530,"I'm probably biased because this situation really hits home... but I would really love to hear his side of the story. Because I've been in this situation and I really understand where he's coming from.  

Yes, OP owns the house. But they've been together for 4 years, and I'm betting there's a good chance that BF is hoping for it to soon become *their* house. He wants to have some input, but OP seems to be kind of hanging ""my house, my rules"" over him, which is true and fair, considering the financial situation, but he probably wants to be treated like a partner.  

Furthermore, having lived in houses that are perpetually being renovated... it sucks. DIY projects for many people have a way of going on for months, if not *years* without being 100% complete. My parents remodeled the breakfast nook 6 years ago and it's still missing trim and paint in a spot. I was with my ex boyfriend for 3 years and he never once in that time had a kitchen with a finished floor, which meant the kitchen got filthy because you couldn't ever clean it properly. I've become so fed up with construction projects I don't see myself ever agreeing to another DIY project while living in the house, unless it can for sure be done in a weekend or two.  

All that said, OP's boyfriend has no right to be rude to her about it, especially when he does so little around the house. But OP seems to be really fed up, so I wonder how much of it is really ""This place is a damn mess, get it cleaned up already"" and not ""Are you going to be finished with the kitchen soon? Because there's not even counter space enough for me to make a sandwich""  "
531,It's probably because she moved away from her family to be with OP and now only has Kenny oh and because she is a horrible person. She should definitely stop being around OP's friends and family.

Once decay in the mouth starts it does not stop just because you get a filling. It doesn't work that way."
533,"She already declined that option. Really, the issue isn't that she doesn't want kids at a circus wedding. The issue is that she won't budge at all to accommodate her fiance's wishes, which is quite concerning considering she's getting married. Her stubbornness and unwillingness to consider ANY compromises suggested here is what's irritating people.

And I mean, really. Who doesn't hate being asked for advice and then having the nose turned up at that advice? Take your issue off reddit if you don't want to hear the truth."
534,"Came home to food, wine, and Stranger Things last night. We binge-watched the 2nd half of the season.

Can confirm. It was heaven."
535,"I totally understand where you're coming from. It's a rough rough situation. However, I feel the from what you said your brother is just in a rough spot right now. He just went through a breakup for whatever reason and any person might need a little help getting back on their feet. I've got a ton of kids so I know they're damn hard to care for. But, a 3 year old from 8pm to early morning hours is pretty simple. You can throw him in a bubble bath for a half an hour. Play with him a bit. Get him in his Jammies and set him up in your room with a kiddo movie on and he'll go right to sleep. I'm assuming he would have already had dinner and such. He's in bed by 9 and your and your girl can chill in the living room or whatever. When you head to bed put little guy on the couch. Of course, let your brother know that you need more notice. That you want to help anyway you can but just need that notice. If you know your brother will be there for you when you need it (at some point you will. Everybody will). It's worth being there for him now. Once he gets a car and catches up money wise after the breakup. Hopefully, he won't need that much. Plus, I know you want to be a great brother and uncle. Also, your brother is being quite awesome even keeping his son every other week. Not a lot of men do this. You just doing this simple thing to help will show your brother you've got his back and when your nephew is grown he's going to be an awesome man just being around you and your brother who are so strong and loving. Just a though. "
536,"I understand the sister being an adult part but just from experience this is potentially drama. 

Im not a big fan of drama. "
537,"&gt;But why didn't your friend or the ex check in advance? I know I would. Is it possible that all of this is exactly what your ex wanted? To appear to be doing nothing wrong while deviously sowing upset and discord in your relationship?

This, exactly. Seems like courtesy to ask ahead of time if it's okay for them to show up to your party. I'm thinking perhaps the ex's new boyfriend didn't really think of it, but I have a feeling the ex knew *exactly* what she was doing. "
538,"She has already stated several times that she can afford to fix it. Their finances are not mixed at all, so those worries are unfounded at this time. She's also stated that she lives in a major metro where cars aren't required and she can easily walk to work. 

If they joined finances and depended on each other monetarily, and lived somewhere were a car was required, this would be a different story. However, that isn't the case here. "
539,Woohoo dude! Happy for ya :)
540,"And if it takes him 6 years to get there, you'll be 33 and in a different place again.  This is why age gaps in your 20s are generally a bad idea.  He wants different things for his future than you do now.  If you make him sacrifice this for you, he will resent you forever, if you relationship lasts.  "
541,But this way she pays off his loans and he gets a house she pays for! Why wouldn't she like that? /s
542,"It is not breaking up with you because she was confused about her feelings, or things were not ok between you both. 

1) She led you on in the last part of your relationship, as you don't mention things were not ok - basically she had the guy already lined up but was waiting to be sure they would become a thing. She cheated on you while making you believe everything was still ok, absolutely disgusting

2) The C-list actor thing is the most pathetic thing here for me, which coupled with the fact she is 31 shows what kind of person she is. It is not even, 'he is the man of my life', no, it is because he is a sort of famous person. She showed you are there to fill the hole until something better comes up

3) The way she left, leaving you to deal with stuff and insinuating you pay for the moving of her stuff... very immature and entitled, again she shows you are nothing to her 

4) This is just my personal opinion, but the fact she didn't care about leaving the dog behind... as an animal person I would be so disgusted by this. And now she misses it? After 7 months of not even asking about it? Fuck no


If you let her come back you are just showing her that her behaviour is excusable, and as long as she begs long enough she can get away with this kind of thing. She is just getting back at you because the C-actor dumped her, not because she really wants you back. She is not partner material. "
543,"Good looooooooord you're a piece of shit. 

You deny your man sex and then engage with OTHER men? He's not getting any because of your problem but you are? Reading this made my blood boil, you're a total scumbag.

Tell him. Today. He has a right to choose if he wants to forgive you and continue the relationship. You have no right to keep this from him. You're obviously prone to betrayal when things aren't going your way and he has a right to decide for himself. Depression is no valid excuse. 

Also, TECHNICALLY cheated?? You fucking cheated. End of story. No technically or word play about it. 

Asshole."
544,"I hate to say it but this goes deeper than just the theft. 

  No don't write the letter it isn't true. 

   She may have a feel a need to steal. But this has been going on for years many years from what you have said. She has always managed to get herself out of it with little to no consequences. 

  Mental health issues or not by not facing any real consequences and even bragging about the stealing shows no remorse on her part. 

  She's not sorry she was stealing she's sorry she got caught. AGAIN 
  
  And now is asking you to lie for her. And yes if you had been with her there is a very good chance you would be facing charges as well. And there is a good chance she might have tried to throw you under the bus because of being caught earlier this year. All that possible might have mattered to her at that point is saving herself and literally leave you holding the bag. 

  The truth is if she had done this 2 times already this summer the stores loss prevention was most likely already looking at her. For her to do this again makes me believe it's a game for her and In fact she likes it. I have known a few girls like her and I once asked why ? The answer I got was that they get a rush like a drug or doing something crazy like riding a motorcycle as fast as they can to see if they live. And it takes bigger and bigger thrills to get that rush. 

  You can not help her and if this continues without her getting help it could lead to major prison time later. 

  The best thing you can do is back away from this train wreck and let her answer for her behavior. I understand that long friendships are hard to back away from but you need to think about you. Because if she gets another slap on the hand. Do you believe she will stop?"
545,"&gt;when confronted, said that I should do it because I am a woman. 

WAT this is in no way acceptable. Would you have tolerated your husband saying this to you? Would your husband tolerate anyone but his brother talking this way to you? Time for him to go. You're not helping him, you're enabling him. And killing yourselves in the process."
546,"I think it's less how *bad* it looks, and more how *unprofessional* it is."
547,"My back muscles ached just from reading that part. Has he ever held a baby older than 1 week? They do this thing called growing, which involves getting heavy."
548,"Thank you! My profession does generally pay comfortably, but I really lucked out with this job! Maybe you're right, he'd probably be more open to it if I backed off the vow renewal part."
549,"I think OP is still really, really angry with his parents, as well as still hoping that they will love him the way he needed to be loved as a child. If he had truly moved on, this post would not even have been written. It's obvious what the answer is - you don't give your parents money for your sister's education.

OP, I say this with total kindness and understanding - your parents were shit, and the past is the past. It's time to grieve it, and, when you're ready, let it go. The best move I ever made as an adult was finally going no-contact with my mean, abusive, gas lighting father and a mother who enabled him and never protected us. It has been extremely empowering for me to care for myself in that way (and scary at times as well). All of my siblings save one still visit/keep in touch with our parents, so there's been kickback from them as well. It ain't easy, but it's totally worth it."
550,"Yes and not everyone has the money or mental drive to go through with a lawsuit. Sometimes, as a woman, you have to weigh whether you want to advance your career or potentially destroy it and your reputation by bringing on a lawsuit. EVEN IF ITS LEGIT. It's just the way the real world works: unfair. Just like other OPs here that report rape and the attacker gets off or another OP reports someone taking a video of a video on her phone and her supervisor gets off... It's just unfair and this OP shouldn't be downvoted for weighing her optionz"
551,"What he did--""pretend"" threatening to not stop the car for you to pee and expecting you to hold it--*can actually cause you to get a UTI*. His other option is for you to dehydrate yourself, which is also jeopardizing your health.

You are doing nothing wrong, and he's being beyond unreasonable and controlling. Have a talk with him about why he's so ridiculously concerned about your peeing schedule. My hope is that he's worried about your health, in which case you can resolve this by going to the doctor together and getting the opinion of a professional (who will almost certainly say you're just fine). But he's exhibited *really* bizarre and concerning behavior. If he doesn't agree to respect you and your health in the future, or agrees and then doesn't follow through...please stay safe. Right now, he is attempting to control  your bodily functions, and that's really concerning."
552,"Can you see how weird it is that your boyfriend has to ACCEPT how often you go to the bathroom? As long as it's not a health concern or literally like every five minutes all the time, it's none of his business. And once in an hour or two is not that often in my opinion. I just don't understand why he cares about your peeing habits so damn much."
553,"&gt; lost thousands in deposits for my parents

Did your sister and her partner offered to refund your parents? If so, I can see why they'd be upset at a several thousands dollars change of mind."
554,"Why do you even want to stay in this marriage and worry about filling his emotional needs?  

You were a teenager when you married him, and it has not turned out well. At least you don't have kids together.

seriously you've listed all these ways in which you've tried to be closer to him, but none where he has made any efforts. Why are you so committed to this crappy marriage? "
555,"He's literally trying to buy your forgiveness. With a $1.50 candy bar. Hell, not even your forgiveness. Just your silence. I bet he will use it against you when he rants about cheating on a non cheat day. What are his redeeming qualities?"
556,"It's very common for people who grow up poor to have bad money management skills. Money can be seen by them as ""you need to spend it or it will be gone."" This is one reason you see ill-considered purchases when they finally get a bit of money. The concept of saving is foreign to them because there was never any accumulation of money to save. I'm vastly over-generalizing, of course. But people from upper/middle class backgrounds often have a tough time understanding the perspective of people from poorer backgrounds. "
557,"I still think it seems like you guys just aren't on the same timeline, even if you both agree you want to get married in the future. If I were you, I'd talk to her about it. "
558,"I think you've revealed how silly, creepy, and weird it is to limit your friendships just because you have the opposite genitalia. The logic all falls apart when you're bisexual. So are you just not allowed to have friends? Because... why, because you can't control yourself or respect your own relationship? What is really the concern? If you're that close to cheating that all it would take is hanging out one-on-one with a man (or in your case, either gender) what does that say about your relationship? A better approach is to have friendships, hang out alone as long as no one crosses boundaries, and actually trust each other. I think both of you are totally unreasonable in how you limit your interactions with the opposite sex to begin with - and that's why extrapolating it to same-sex friendships is controlling and unreasonable also."
559,"Tell him you have plans on X night so he'll ""be in charge at home that night"". Pump milk, leave in fridge, get in the car and go out. Or, alternatively and/or in addition at a later date: take the baby and go on a solo weekend vacation. "
560,"I know, right?

""You're upset about something that I did (allegedly), so not only will I negate your feelings, but I will somehow make it look like you've done something horrible in an attempt to guilt you out of pursuing the matter further""

My ex did this to me ALL THE TIME. "
561,"If you say you're sorry it sets a precedent. This won't be the first time you're ""disowned"" or threatened with it. Just an FYI."
562,"Oh, OP. This is so awful. You're carrying his baby, and he can't do the fricking dishes. You're exhausted during the first trimester, and you're still working full time and paying the bills, and he still won't do one freaking sink of dirty dishes. 

Seriously. This is giving me flashbacks to my first marriage. My ex wouldn't do any thing for me, for most of the marriage I supported us, and he spent on himself but cross-examined me exhaustively and sulked over anything I bought for myself.

I am so so so glad I divorced him and married someone who will do more than the minimum. 

OP, I really feel for you. Maybe you can try some marriage counseling. "
563,"I read every word of this, and for the life of me I can't figure out why you'd even bother trying to make things right with her.  She's toxic. 

Focus on your business and don't get dragged down by this woman."
564,If they make less than 75k a year her sister will get tuition assistance or free tuition in the ivy leagues.
565,"No.  Don't do it.  It would be a shit show and you know it.

If you want to do this at all, get a mortgage and buy the house in just your name.  It's a very modest amount that you'd need to borrow.  You'd need to save up your own money to pay the professionals for things like the roof and plumbing.  Dad could help with easier stuff like painting.

Don't fall for the ""I'll buy it and rent it to you, and you'll eventually own it"" plan.  That hardly ever ends well."
566,"Bring your phone, but also bring print-outs and/or a USB drive with screenshots that they can keep. I've heard stories of cops who are feeling asshole-ish taking an entire phone as ""evidence"" if digital proof of crimes like stalking are only contained on that device.

567,"Honestly, it's a common parenting strategy, but in a situation like this -- where your brother is incredibly close to getting locked up, a history of assault is no joke -- it's putting far too much on your shoulders.

What's your mom's attitude towards therapy? Has it been suggested an option, or is your family the type that 'doesn't believe' in therapists?

From your posts, I'm worried that the adults in your family don't appreciate how serious this is. Violent assaults mean we're long past the point of just telling him ""be a good boy, you're upsetting your little sister"".

People are getting hurt. Your brother has a criminal record. OP, this is serious shit."
568,"That sounds great, but you have another ten years before you find out if your method of parenting works any better."
569,"Cheating is not a character flaw that certain people are born with, it's caused by a variety of biological and emotional circumstances. For example It's been shown that people under the age of 26 cheat more than people of any other age, I would assume that's because younger people have higher libidos and are more likely to take risks to get what they want. Cheating is also much more common when the honeymoon stage of a relationship starts to end, we're biologically designed to lose attraction toward our partner and seek out new mates once we've had many orgasms with the same person, because it indicates we have successfully passed on our DNA to that partner. This is also why breakups are extremely common between the six month-two year mark if the couple haven't conceived a child during that time. Biologically and emotionally everyone is capable of cheating once their genes are ready to seek out a new partner, what deters most people is generally a moral sense that cheating is wrong. People who cheat can easily develop a moral sense that cheating is wrong (most often after being cheated on themselves). They're not designed differently from other people and they're not ""bad"" people, they most likely just haven't had the right set of experiences that would have caused them to develop that particular moral value, so they're largely acting on biological urges as opposed to rational reasoning. "
570,"No. This guy was our friend. He came over and ate, drank- hung out. I didn't go to his ""boss"" which would be the person above him. I went to our friend who happens to be higher ranking than him."
571,"Female feedee (the counterpart to a feeder) weighing in here (pun fully intended - and no, I'm not fat).  Let me explain our fetish a little.

Among ""feeders"" and ""feedees"" there are a variety of tastes and kinks that comprise this fetish.  

Of the feeders, some enjoy the food aspect itself, watching somebody eat, watching somebody enjoy food - this is sometimes sexual - ice cream, banana, I'll leave that to your imagination.  Some enjoy stuffed bellies in an aesthetic and/or tactile sense.  Some enjoy the fat itself in an aesthetic and/or tactile sense, and this is to different degrees - some prefer a few curves and love-handles, others are attracted to the super morbidly obese.  Some enjoy the bonding aspect of a relationship where they are - as you describe yourself enjoying with your SO - ""treating somebody like a princess,"" pampering them, bringing them food and making them feel beautiful.

The feedees are the counterpart.  They're the ones who eat, either fed or encouraged by a feeder.  Like the feeders, some enjoy the food aspect - eating, sometimes sexually - some enjoy the sensation of being full to bursting, some enjoy the feeling of being fat (some find the ""jiggling"" sensations you describe to be erotic - it's a kink), some enjoy that bonding aspect of being made to feel like a princess and brought food.

But most importantly, first and foremost, we're people in relationships.

The feeders and feedees that get attention on TV and Buzzfeed articles are by far the extremes of the fetish.  Most of us aren't like that.  Most of us have a level head on our shoulders and realize that we have a fetish that - if allowed to be - can be dangerous to the health.  Many of us find ways to indulge our fantasies in ways that don't involve one person putting their wellbeing at permanent and serious risk.  A weekend of roleplay every now and then wearing a fat suit and taking on the ""pampering"" lifestyle, for instance.  Dirty talk describing how much I've eaten and how fat I've been getting lately (even if I haven't), deliberately buying clothes that are too small so I can pretend I've grown out of them.  I personally find the feeling of stuffing myself until I'm so full it hurts to be arousing, so I will do so occasionally with something like watermelon or boiled white rice so I can get those sensations and physical changes without filling my arteries with cholesterol.

Some feeder and feedee couples of course do find some weight gain to be appealing and erotic enough that they both come to the decision it's what they want.  But, I repeat, they are first and foremost people in a relationship, and as with any fetish or kink - BDSM, petplay, findomme - communication and respect are key.

It's possible that your boyfriend thinks you are enjoying gaining all of this weight for him, and that you share his fetish.  Even talking about wanting to lose weight, or expressing dissatisfaction with what you've gained, he may not realize you're serious - those sorts of things are sometimes said by feedees as a kind of teasing, when both know that it's not really meant.

What you need to do is sit him down and discuss this with him openly and clearly, and tell him this is a serious discussion for the future of your relationship.  Clearly you want to lose the weight.  He wants you to gain.  It's up to you whether you are into this man enough to be willing to indulge his kinks after you've lost the weight enough that you can both have a fulfilling sex life and neither are doing anything you're uncomfortable with - roleplay or occasionally living the ""fat and lazy"" lifestyle for a day, for instance, if you're comfortable with it.  It's up to him to decide whether he's going to be a boyfriend first and a feeder second, or whether he is an asshole who puts himself first (which can show itself in any way, it's not unique to feeders).

Ideally, he would support you at whichever weight you want to be at, and discuss his kinks clearly with you, so that you can decide either that you might be willing to play along in ways that won't damage your health (with safewords established), or that you are simply sexually incompatible and might be better off with other people.  And that's all right.

Sorry for the novel, but I hope this lends a new perspective."
572,"I think that it's a prank, so sign the papers.

Good luck OP's husband."
573,"Thanks a lot for your help.


Sadly, these were the original words I used when we first spoke. I said that it felt like I was renting a room from him and that the space belonged to him and his partner. It's not about the space being used it's about the overall principle of it. I feel like I've drawn a short straw and how I'd treat this scenario is far different. Even when my ex girlfriend came home who I hadn't seen for a month, I still didn't allow it to get out of hand by her staying for days on end."
574,"He's not even correct. The year over year increase in genetic disorders by maternal age is exactly the same until age 34. At 35 it jumps a bit and then increases more and more each year, but it's still ""only"" a 1% chance for Down's Syndrome at age 40. "

580,"Do you have a smartphone?  Most have text-to-talk or apps that will help you type more quickly.  I know it's ""just a phone"" but this inability of yours is impeding your life, career and relationships.  Your husband could be in an ER, dying, and it'd be hours before you knew.  Like it or not, cells phones are here to stay and knowing how to use them is essential.

Make yourself stick to a schedule with using the phone.  You're 29 years old, forgetting is not an excuse.  If you can build a computer you CAN learn how to operate a cell phone.  If you have a smart phone, get one that has the case built into the wallet.  That way, you can't leave the house without it.  If you're really so absentminded that you'd still forget it, find a way to attach your keys to it as well.  Wear it around your neck if you have to because this problem is a little out of hand.  Get a car charger so you always have means of keeping it charged."
581,"You told him the first time he did it that it hurt, and his response was to do it AGAIN, when you were even more vulnerable/defenseless because you were asleep.  This isn't about having a different sense of humor; what he did was really, really disrespectful.  

For health reasons, I have to be very proactive about people doing ""funny"" things that they claim don't hurt that much; there's enough stuff around that triggers flare-ups and pain without some doofus doing it for fun.  But even setting my weirdo body aside, to me it would come down to telling someone that what he did hurt, and waking up to find him doing it again for no reason than because he thinks it's funny.  That's a huge violation in my books."

If sleeping over was her main concern then why did she leave with someone else?

Why didn't you just leave her with her friends and go home yourself when things started escalating?

If you had her phone (wtf) she had to be home to tell her sister you were drunk or you were visibly drunk. 

Your friends were there how is she convincing them you were drunk? "
584,So if you had nudes that could possibly be leaked on the internet by your little brother you wouldn't be livid or losing your shit right now?  I call bullshit on that.

He is not a good person and I hope you realize that before you're divorced with 3 kids at 30.

I wound up telling her about six hours later. You see, we don't keep secrets from each other, and I would be damned if I let some asshole screw that up.

596,[removed]
597,And she WILL go for the child. She's already seeing the girl as a pawn.
598,"&gt;At **his request** our relationship is completely secret... His reasoning makes sense to me, people are aware that I'm married but not that I'm getting divorced and I don't want to deal with that gossip.

That reasoning would make sense if this was a secret at *your* request. That reasoning makes zero sense for him to be concerned about on your behalf, if it isn't something that made you independently want to keep this secret.

&gt;When we talk about coming out, the biggest thing that comes up is that with his best friend being my boss, he doesn't want the fact that we're dating to change the nature of their relationship... [Because she's higher up the ladder than him] it wouldn't be good for them to date.

This also makes ZERO sense. Her position of authority over him means that it's not appropriate for them to date, but doesn't prevent them from being best friends? Best friends that are so close that they're discussing things that they wouldn't, if she knew who he was dating?

I'm sorry, but I am 99% sure that the reason he's keeping your relationship from her is not because of her *professional* relationship with either of you.

All of his reasons for keeping this secret are complete nonsense, and he's switching up which reason he cares about as you continue to discuss it. There is something else going on here. My best guess is that he thinks that as a divorcing woman with a history of poly relationships, he can do whatever he wants without looking like an asshole to outsiders. Hard to say exactly, without knowing more about what boundaries you've laid down in this relationship and how clearly you've talked about it."

Dude - this is an incredibly valid reason to break up. I couldn't stand being in a relationship that essentially had a ticking down clock on it "
604,"While i and many other people on here disagree with you, i do commend you for being honest with her. It was fucked up of her to lie for so long but it is probably a huge huge issue for her.

I think you broke up with her as nicely as you seem to be capable of doing, in time she will be able to move past it and be with someone who will love all parts of her, past present and future."
605,"/u/AgentZen's answer is correct but doesn't address the reason you have these fears, which is because of your abusive first boyfriend. I suggest taking advantage of that free counselling at your school to talk about this in September. 

Basically, the way Hal approaches sex is the way a normal boyfriend approaches sex. The way your first boyfriend did is the way a date rapist approaches sex."
606,"I agree with so much of this. You described exactly how I feel much better than I have!

I do disagree about the girlfriend's response, though. Nothing in OP's post indicates that she wanted him to throw her out publicly or anything, so it sounds like she just demanded that OP do what he should have done, which was to quietly take the friend aside and ask them politely to leave. I think she's totally entitled to that. It's not like she threw a fit and ruined her own party or made an attempt to humiliate the ex. Sounds like just a minor disagreement between the two of them at the party that could have been resolved by the OP discreetly doing the right thing. "
607,"My mum had a really rapid decline from the time her Crohn's started up until she got properly diagnosed and on the right meds for it. OP, get your wife to a GP or specialist immediately and tell them what's going on and ask for urgent tests. Undiagnosed and untreated Crohn's can lead to surgeries, colostomy bags, and a lifetime of heavy steroids to control it. I'm not saying it's definitely Crohn's because the disease can manifest in different ways for a lot of people, but if it is, she needs to get diagnosed and treated ASAP before it has an even more severe, long-term impact on her life. "
608,"Not gonna lie...if you were my kids, I'd have a hell of a time coming to terms with this. If you'd been teenagers or older when you met, I'd have an easier time understanding. But you were raised together as siblings from early childhood, and that makes things awkward. Your parents have spent a long time thinking of you as family to each other. It'll be a shock that not only are you a romantic couple, but you got all the way to *engagement* while keeping them totally in the dark.

While I don't want to question your relationship, I do think the situation merits some specialized pre-marital counseling, ideally with individual counseling on the side. It will help you both navigate the tricky family situation and ensure that your relationship is solid enough to withstand it. Do some research and find the best counselor/therapist you can afford. I would have something set up *before* you talk to your parents, not just to help you cope, but to help convince them that you're being responsible and covering your bases. If they freak out initially, it may help calm them down to know that you'll be speaking with a third party about the situation and ensuring that you're both ready to take this step.

609,"&gt;There's no reason to have her in daycare when her mother is ""sitting right there""

610,"All of this.  You're young and you're new parents; you're going to be depressed and overworked.  Going on medication was a good idea, but you might need to try a few different medications before finding one that helps.

Are you going to the park or something else simple + relaxing with your GF and daughter?  That might be something worth considering if you're not doing it already.  It'd also be good to ask your GF's parents if they can look after your daughter for an evening so you two can do something fun together.  It's going to be rough no matter what for a while, but even if you don't get the spark back, the effort to get a good working relationship re: parenting won't be wasted."

629,"He literally said to you, ""you are just going to be sad with what you see on there."" He told you that there are upsetting pictures on there. What would upset you? Pictures of him with other women (edit: or, as pointed out by others, it could be saved porn, pics of drug use or illicit activity, etc.)

He's very obviously cheating on you (edit: or doing something else he knows you would be upset about, and is hiding). This is open-and-shut. Then he also tried to gaslight you into feeling bad when you did literally nothing wrong.

But to seriously answer your question:


&gt;He says it's normal to ask a SO to change things. Is it?


Sometimes. Does your SO have bad breath or preventable body odour? Fail to meet minimum grooming standards (i.e., regular bathing and toothbrushing, wiping after you go to the bathroom, etc)? Use a personal care product which you're allergic to? Want sex immediately after working out, without showering first? Yes, it's reasonable to ask them to change, as long as you ask IN A NICE WAY. You don't make cutting little comments that make your partner cry, you say, ""Hey, your beard is kind of giving me a rash, would you mind shaving before we make out?""


Your bf is not doing that. He is controlling and belittling about your appearance, and sees absolutely wrong with his behaviour. I hope he very soon becomes your ex-boyfriend, because there is no way this is ever getting better. "

656,"They already gave up on you though-in favour of your cheating ex. :-(

However, if you have other, non-rubbish friends in the area, focus on hanging out with them an cut the bad ones from your life. They've already made their decision clear, you can't change it, the only thing that you can do is choose whether to tolerate it or not."

I'll for sure check out that sub and post there. Thanks!"
659,"Separate the issues in your mind, and deal with each separately.

You think it's an unwise management decision: probably no action required. It's his responsibility.

You don't like your family money being spent on it: Arrange finances between you and your husband so that you have some common funds for common expenses, and you each have at least a little money that's yours to spend as you please. This outing comes entirely out of his own money. Not your problem.

You won't deal well with the event healthwise: Don't go. Ask for the restaurant coupon maybe; but if you use it to go to a restaurant later with your husband, there could be a conflict of interest issue.

You don't like him coming home late at night and drunk: Tell him to come home quietly and sleep on the sofa so he doesn't wake you up no matter what time he comes in. Or have either him or you spend the night at a friend's house or something. Actually, the drunkness is a difficult problem and I'm not sure how to handle it. Maybe see a couples counsellor about it or something. Getting drunk is bad.

You're afraid he'll get in a car accident or something? Tell him your concerns. Tell him you don't want to babysit him. Beyond that I'm not sure what to do. Difficult problem.

I think that refusing to attend the event may help slightly in discouraging this sort of drunken behaviour in the future, by refraining from tacitly approving and enabling it.

What if one of the other employees drives home drunk and gets in an accident? Might the company be liable? Check the rules.

Wait, wait -- he's planning to drive the car home after drinking for hours?! Confiscate the car and motorcycle keys in the late afternoon and find some way to keep them away from him. (Lock them up/give them to someone else for safekeeping/hide them really effectively; or park the car and motorcycle far from home). If necessary warn the police that he's planning to DUI. Tell your husband that you're warning the police.

Surely attending such an event and then driving the car home would be against company rules?

Suggest to your husband that he inform the employees that he's sorry, it's against company rules, they'll have to do something else instead (He can buy them all gift cards; they might appreciate them more than a night of drinking anyway.)"
660,"Wait. She doesn't like meat or the smell of bacon and you think that it's RUDE that she removes herself from the room that has the smell she doesn't like?

Are you insane?"
661,"None of what you said is true. You can get it via oral, and it most certainly does not clear up on its own. "
662,"&gt; My SO says he’s worried I won’t stick around if he’s unable to have sex for a while, like if he gets injured.

Lol, tell him that should be the least of his worries since you're still with him despite the lacking sex so far.

Anyway, some people just don't like giving oral and it seems he's one of them despite him claiming otherwise. Alright, that's his right, BUT he should be upfront about it instead of lying, and he should work together with you on how the two of you can make sex more pleasurable for you (e.g. him fingering you or using a vibrator or other toys on you, etc.) instead of him just using you as a mouth and pussy hole to get off and leaving you unstatisfied. That's not how you treat a partner, that's how you treat a sex toy."
663,"No offense taken. I feel bad for them. To never take a vacation or do anything for themselves. I dimly recall they went on a vacation in 1980-ish and that's the last time I can recall. They're in their 70's now and still you never see them sit down or stop. It's sad to me. 

Hopefully your girlfriend will do like I saw so many others do (I used to live with aunt and uncle). They last a year or so then quit. It really takes a special kind of fanatic to take to Amway and stick with it for the long haul. "
664,"Here's the deal though. Your option number one should read more like:

665,"The thing she is changing her mind about is a dealbreaker the boyfriend laid out before they even got together.

People are allowed to change their mind at any time, but doing so can carry consequences."

668,"Neither of you are wrong about the way to go about this saving thing. Your wife wants to get some high savings asap, and you'd rather sacrifice some of that speed for some better quality living. 

The main thing to do is to compromise. I suggest sitting down together and talking about what you (as a couple) are ok with not spending money on. Do this without bringing the actual amount of money into it, this will help you both see the quality of life you want to aim for while saving, and give you a better idea of the things you want.     
Another idea with this is for you to have the ability to assign one or two things each as high priority.  

Once you've discussed this without money, you can add money back into it. It'll be a bit easier to discuss because you'll both have more of an idea about what's important to the other person. (for example, for your wife yoga may be really low on her priority list if she can just do it for free at home, and being able to eat very well is priority for you.)

i don't have any advice, really, because when i was in your shoes (at your age, actually, with my mom only a couple of years older than yours, but all else the same), i could never figure out quite what to do for my  mom, since encouraging her to carve out a life and offering her suggestions for doing so never seemed to do any good.   just wanted you to know that someone understands how you feel.

i will say this, based on another suggestion and your subsequent comment.  we even tried the moving in with me thing.  that did... not work.  all it resulted in was her wanting to wrap her life around me just as she'd done in my youth, and feeling ostracized and left out when i - as a grownup - continued with my life, much of which didn't involve her, at least not to the degree she would've liked.  it actually made things *worse*.  she found it twice as painful, that now she lived with me and i STILL wasn't around as much as she'd like me to be, and i felt resentful and hostile due to her quiet demands.

all this said.  your mom lives in california, where i live, and i can vouch that there is SO much to do, even (and honestly, even *especially*) for women your mother's age.

if she isn't choosing to do them, there's really not a lot you can do, to be honest. but my heart goes out to you both.

editing to add:

ultimately, after my mom lived with me for about seven years, she opted to move back 'home'.  that's when she finally decided to 'get off her ass' (as she put it) and find something to do with her life.  so ultimately she DID decide to, but it did take awhile, and it took her coming to that conclusion on her own.

she may simply feel that with you grown, and no family around, and at the doddering age of 52 (sarcasm - but that may indeed be how she feels about it), that there's nothing much left to do with herself.  perhaps you can call her out on this, gently (not, ""get off your ass, you ain't dead yet!"" but rather, ""is this the thing that's bothering you?  if so, do you really think all you were put here for was to take care of me, and that's it, and now that i'm grown, you've no other purpose?"" and let her ruminate on it). and perhaps that might be the wakeup call she needs to go out and live her life."

If you feel so strongly about this man, do this girl a favor and end it.  You've talked about a serious life together, marriage and kids but you don't mean it.  Don't string her along."
692,Your boyfriend is abusing you. Leave him. 
693,"Why on *earth* would you be with someone who doesn't want kids?

Why are you trying to fix a relationship with someone who doesn't want kids?

Edited to also say I can understand why she's upset. Either you truly believe what you said to her and that's why it came out, or you said it *to* hurt her.

My guess here is you don't really understand being child-free."
694,"It doesn't sound like you were making a big deal of it, just that you needed help. She shouldn't have been so snarky about it."
695,"Thanks. Yeah Craigslist has actually been fairly successful so far. I checked out a room last night, seeing two more tonight, and another one on Sunday :) "
696,"My husband and I walked down the aisle together. Both our sets of parents walked down the aisle as part of the processional, as did our brother and grandmothers. No bridal party. No hurt feelings. It was great."
697,"I'm under the impression that it is a fever and you're fine, assuming you're of good health initially &amp; not planning to have kids within the next 6 months. Enlighten us then?"
698,"&gt;  I have a guy who loves me even tho I'm 300+ lbs.

WRONG.

You have a guy who **uses you as a sex toy**. He doesn't care about your health. He doesn't care about you. He only cares about what makes you sexy to him, which is your weight. He is using you."
699,"If you're in school &amp; financially dependent on your parents, what you do with them needs to be tempered by the fact that you need them not to withdraw financial support.

/u/SMTRodent suggested ghosting, and I'd like to suggest modified ghosting: after talking to them (or whatever), become quietly distant. tell them very little about yourself. be vague when possible. let them know only enough to keep tuition money going. "
700,"You know what this morning I would have read your message and sobbed. I would have sent him a text begging him to take me back. But 300 people on this thread have replied and I think he is the one who endangered his career and reputation when he stabbed the table I sat at. Maybe I shouldn't have called our friend, but I DID NOT do anything to endanger his career- he did that just fine on his own."
701,I'm a teacher and kids are GROSS. It's sad that her students probably have better hygiene than their teacher...
702,"&gt;we were set up, he didn't approach me.

he liked you enough to come back for seconds instead of walking away. do you think he did that because in his mind you were the only girl who would have him? where do you place the possibility that he was actually attracted to you? you clearly consider that to be a statistical impossibility but ""attraction"" is a package deal that has less to do with how you measure up with the Conventionally Attractive Face Chart than you might think. Is there nothing you find likeable about his looks?"
703,"I certainly don't blame you at all. I also think their closeness makes it easier for them to cross boundaries together, but that's not to say he will physically cheat.  

I guess if I didn't want to bail out right,  I would want to know why they never got back together officially. Why don't they work romantically yet still rely so heavily on each other emotionally and physically (when single)? Are they seeing if they can do better while keeping the other as backup?  I just don't understand it."
704,"Haha this is SO ADORABLE!!! It reminded me of the time my boyfriend  of 3 months told me he loves me when we were spending the weekend in the mountains. We were drunk so I didn't want to say it yet. Next day we went snowboarding in the mountains (first time snowboarding ever for me) with his best friend but despite how much I kept falling and staying down for so long because I was exhausted he was so patient with me. I told him there on the mountains that I love him and his face burst with happiness lol. We have been together for almost 4 years now and eloping in Thailand this Oct! 

Sorry for long post, you reminded me of a sweet memory! All the best for you and your girlfriend!! 😊"
705,"It doesn't sound like it's specifically about the weight loss to me. More like he doesn't want you to go through the process of losing weight which includes possible disruption to him and less time to spend together. It's about the changes in your lifestyle, not why you're making them. I tend to think he just needs some time to get used to it. Many people are creatures of habit and changes like this can unsettle them until they settle back in. Doesn't mean you should stop or change what you're doing."
706,Maybe do your research before you make a dumb comment next time. 
707,"For my weekly game night, it usually starts at 6 and runs until 9, maybe 10 at the most if my matches are on the long end. On a normal day, I would come home from work and have dinner with the family before going out."
708,I'm sorry but I just got a mental image of a Village People themed wedding. Thanks for the giggle.

710,"Keep reading that list and think, if it was one of your friends' boyfriends or your sisters boyfriend, how much would you hate that bastard? You deserve so much better, and I wouldn't wish that disgusting POS ex of yours on my worst enemy. You're better than that. Find someone who treats you with respect and actually deserves you "
711,"Ideally if they're your friends they won't care about gay porn. I'm not about to tell my friends about my porn habits but they make gay porn look vanilla.  Is that even a fetish? If you're straight I guess it might be, but there's nothing wrong with being gay or bi or whatever you want to call it in todays society if you are.

Theres a reason porn mode exists for on every browser, and why its possible to delete your internet history. I learned that lesson the hard way when my parents caught me like 10 years ago. Now its a lesson you've learned too.

Don't lie to yourself, if you feel violated and attacked you're obviously not okay with her knowing. You said in another comment that you're not ashamed of it, but why are you describing it as being ""caught red handed"" if you're not?  Like come on, you've been on about this for a whole week right? Thats why you made this post.

As the guy who got downvoted away put it, and how you yourself put it, ""own it"". Theres nothing to be ashamed of, but if you are ashamed theres nothing wrong with it. Emotions are what they are, and are hard to control. If it makes you feel more comfortable to talk to her, and she is as good of a friend as you say she is, then do it. On the other hand if it doesn't don't do it. 

If you choose to talk to her, the only thing you need to do is ask her not to tell anyone else if you want to keep it on the down low. If she could tell your embarrassment then she probably won't tell anyone else, but since you tried to play it off she might think its funny will make a good joke. Also start use porn mode &lt;_&lt;"
712,even if it's a dog.  At least a dog won't complain.
713,"Eh, in my experience those kinds of conversations never end well with people who you have a power differential with (like a parent). Disengaging and removing ammunition causes way less drama."
714,"""It's your body and I get no say in what you do with it, but I have to tell you that I really, really dont like tattoos and generally consider it one of my biggest turn offs.  I can't promise you in advance how I will feel, in terms of attraction towards you, if you go through with this."""
715,"I get this feeling you have an overromanticized view of this, something in your language and tone, it's like a shitty Franzen outline sans plot (hmm). As if it's this tempestuous love affair with a lot of flowery language and extravagant passions, great highs and lowly lows, and not a single goddam detail or scene. 

What are you two screaming about all the time? This is like reading the psych 101 overview. Did the woman put her hands around your neck because you were in bed with a Czech prostitute or because you forgot to buy diapers? Not that it's a laudable act, but what's the freaking issue?

Drag your sorry carcasses to a marriage counselor before you kill each other in some overwritten misunderstanding or ruin your children simply through your mutually poor emotional regulation. 

Or lawyers. Lawyers are often good too. Your pick.

I seriously can't believe you wrote this florid purple tome, you're 41, grow up. "
716,"Oh god this guy sounds really mediocre at best. 

If he's not willing to change on his own or therapy- you could be a lot happier with someone else, open marriage perhaps?"
717,"Depending on the area this really isn't that weird. Stuff is really spread out here and most places have abysmal public transportation. Many places a car is a necessity if you want to do things like buy your food from an actual grocery store or work anywhere other than the one or two businesses in town. Heck, even my high school was about 15 miles from my parent's house. Add that to the lack of sidewalks, crosswalks, and generally safe for walking roadsides and you can see why walking isn't done much. Where I grew up almost everyone hiked in their spare time so it's not like we hated walking on principal or never got off our butts but it was rare to walk anywhere as a form of transportation. If I saw someone I knew walking I'd pull over and ask if they need help. "
718,"i tend to mention some of my assorted psychological issues over the course of the first few dates.  i always tell them if i am managing these issues (via medication or therapy).  i don't want to waste my time on meaningless or dead end relationships.  if they decide i'm not worth dealing with, that's less time wasted.  i've found that the stigma surrounding mental illness has lessened considerably over the past couple of decades."
719,"Plus it takes away the option for her to later  say ""he didn't even inform the doctors office what happened to the kids, like I asked him to!"""
720,"&gt; I read this sub every day and I know if he wrote to you guys ""my girl is gaining weight and I'm not sexually attracted to her, what should I do"" you'd all tell him to talk to me

He'd also probably get told that even though you've gained some weight, you're 25 pounds lighter than when you met.  If he wasn't attracted to someone over ~125 pounds, he shouldn't date someone 50 pounds over that and then expect her to change.

He'd get told that expecting someone who had health issues that kept them in bed and who had experienced both a pregnancy and a miscarriage to continue the rate of weight loss they'd been experiencing before is absurd.

He'd get told to be extremely careful of navigating any conversations (including non-verbals like rolling his eyes when he doesn't approve of your food) regarding food, health, or weight when his girlfriend has an eating disorder, and that it might be better to just drop the subject entirely.
"
721,"&gt;That's kind of hyperbolic

I'm not sure it is, actually. 
"
722,This...is terribly suspicious for a few reasons. He is too emotionally attached to her. It is inappropriate for him to constantly be talking to her when you two are spending time together. It's weird that he's talking about her constantly. He is also unwilling to introduce you to her. He is far too invested in her and is possibly having an emotional affair with this girl. I would definitely recommend bringing this up and also showing him this thread.
723,"Just going to tag onto this that /u/dugareecat is correct that this is really unacceptable behavior.

That said, if you want to try to make this work, a few things have to happen. 

1) Talk to your child and make clear that while the adults are going through some normal ups and downs of life, sometimes we can all lose are cool. Let him know that he is not a burden, very desperately wanted by both of his parents, and also reassure him that your life is not going to fall apart. Kids can get anxious when their stability is threatened. Husband should apologize to kid.

2) Clearly husband is overwhelmed (not an excuse, just a reason). You both should get into couples counseling (try through church or work insurance or whatever you've got) so you can communicate to him your perspective on these life events and get the apology you deserve, and so he can learn to communicate his issues with you better. If you can't talk this stuff out, then your relationship will slowly fall apart."
724,"Go home. If the fact you're a creepy sexpat is disturbing to you, the obvious answer is to remove yourself from your circumstances and to neuter your ability to creep on girls. Alcoholics who want to change don't spend their lives working for Budweiser and their free time in bars, and a sexpat who wants to reform wouldn't remain overseas. Simply moving back to the United States would essentially destroy your entire creeplife and you can focus completely on learning to respect other people."
725,"Your brother was drunk and irresponsible and as a result made a decision that had a lasting impact on your other brother who never had a choice in all of this. If you want to spend time with your brother spend time with your brother, but I am on team parent and sister on this one. He did not ""make a mistake"" he was drunk. That was not a ""mistake"" that was a decision to be drunk that created an innocent victim."
726,"&gt;She's my best, and I'm just some mediocre number for her now.  

You don't know this, so cancel the pity party. She's dating YOU now, and that means something. You guys called it quits for a handful of years, and you BOTH went and did your own things. You both slept with other people, and you both broadened your sexual horizons. The past isn't what matters. The now is.

While I think you're acting like a pig, I'm not going to talk down to you. At least you're acknowledging that this is something you need to get past...I guess...  

Anyway.  

You have to get over this, plain and simple. You have to accept and recognize that this woman has changed, and she's no longer the person you knew. For that matter, you're no longer the man she knew.  

&gt; I loved I wasn't competing against dozens of other guys.....and up to that time, I was probably the best lover she'd ever had. It made me feel confident and cared for.  

You've got a lot of insecurities that you need to work through. Why do you feel inadequate? Do you feel like you're bedroom skills are lackluster?

So. Did. You. You're not so innocent yourself."
727,"The funniest thing here is that prior to this, mom has had never been to a mosque. Her whole family are Alevis and let just say that they don't have a very good opinion on mosques and imams as a whole. So you can add that to the list of shocks I received from my sister regarding mom"
728,"Really depends on the person.  I was only able to successfully lose weight when I STOPPED trying to drop all sweets from my diet and focused on moderation instead.  Dropping all sweets made me crazy with sugar withdrawal or whatever for about a week every time until I lost it and binged and felt like shit about myself.  Being calorie-aware, tracking how much I'm eating but not limiting WHAT I'm eating is working so much better.  My house is full of sweets and delicious food and I'm down 75 pounds.  I'd rather not live a life completely free of chocolate and cheesecake and pizza, and trying to commit to that wasn't working out."

It sounds like he wants a divorce and is trying to trick you into signing papers without having any understanding of what you're doing or any legal representation.

Copy the papers and take them to a divorce attorney.  Don't sign them.  Ask an attorney what they think."

739,"IMO, she thinks it is a feminine hobby and you look ""less of a man"" when you do that. She is just trying to camouflage it by saying that she feels inferior to your love of baking and all that."
740,"I used to think the same, and here's what I have to say to that today. You will always unconsciously surround yourself with the kind of people you think you deserve. If you are insecure and think little of yourself, you'll find the world is cram-packed with assholes. They will be all you see, and all you experience, for years and years. For forever, if it takes that long for you to change. 

Over the course of 5 years as a young adult, I dated only assholes. I was sexually assaulted multiple times, was beat on numerous occasions, and was controlled and manipulated by many partners. I kept asking, *why?* How was it that everyone I dated turned into a horrible person?

Fortunately / unfortunately, after developing PTSD after going through a horrific experience, I took a step back and started looking at myself. It wasn't ""men"" that was the problem, but me. The men I dated didn't *turn* into horrible people; they *were* horrible.  I let them into my life because, on some level, I truly believed this was the best I could do. I felt *lucky* to have them in my life.

After a few years of work, I learned to demand more from my partners and, suddenly, the world was full of good people. I met one of them, and he showed me what a healthy relationship looked like. The love, kindness, and *respect* he showed me was beautiful in a million ways, and we've been together since. Back then, I honestly didn't think a relationship could be like this, but now, I wonder how I ever believed it couldn't. The men I've met in the years since, through and outside of my partner, have almost all been truly wonderful people. I have no expectation that my relationship will fail, but, if it did, I know there are *plenty* of good men in the world. Your friend, sadly, doesn't know this, but you can and will, so long as you can love yourself. 

**EDIT**: Just to add... Loving yourself isn't necessarily a passive thing. I spent years changing – facing my weaknesses and overcoming those that I could, and accepting those that I couldn't. For myself, personally, the whole ""love yourself"" concept is inadequate. Rather than ""love yourself as you are"", I want to instead emphasize, ""make yourself into the person you can love"". "
741,"Yeah, they offer (well, Canada anyways) eye ointment for babies at birth if you are worries about any risk of exposure for that very reason. "
742,"&gt;Tara said she doesn't feel special when I'm baking. She thinks I bake because I love the activity rather than the reason being that I love her.  
.  
&gt;btw, English is not my first language and I have a thick accent, so there may be some type of misunderstandings as well.  
  
Is it possible she means you're spending too much time baking and not enough quality time with her, which makes her feel less special?  
  
How often do you bake that this is an issue? How much of your time does it take up? Do you spend quality time together, just the two of you, no pastries involved?"

744,"&gt; I don't know but I know what people are like

Apparently not, really, since she wants to get to know you and they have had a platonic friendship for over a decade. 

&gt;Why does he need this friendship? 

Why can't he have this friendship? To even question why he needs a friendship with someone who has been there for him for *twelve years* shows your controlling and insecure tendencies. Why does anyone need friendships? For companionship, someone to talk to, shared interests, happiness, etc. And no, you should not be the only person in his life capable of giving him those things. 

&gt;What does she give him?

A solid, long-term, platonic friendship. 

Why is he not allowed to have this harmless friendship that he wants to include you in?

Why are you so against changing you mind and being friendly to someone who is being friendly to you?

745,"You can still use a physical key. We have one each (although in OP's case it might be wise to just hide one somewhere and only tell the kids after it's necessary). Otherwise, it isn't connected to the power, so an outage shouldn't effect it, the app tells us if the batteries are low, and in case of a malfunction it's still a working lock (thank goodness!). 

We got it mainly to avoid having to give out a key after a friend ""borrowed"" my boyfriends key and made a copy to surprise him for his birthday, and then she ""lost"" it. Before I moved in she would pop by and set up pranks in his house, or drop by with lunch when he was sick. Obviously she is now not my biggest fan, and having somehow lost the key after using it fairly regularly, we felt a little uncomfortable. So we replaced the lock and set it up so that we wouldn't have to give a key out to anyone.  "

765,"&gt;  I just cannot help but feel like i was an accident in this world. Like i wasn't planned and that drove my dad to seek out another woman because my mom was done with sex.

Wow there's a lot to unpack in that little sentence. That's a whole post in and of itself. 

Don't blame yourself for you dad's affair. It's not your fault. Your parents sexual relationship is not your responsibility.

Who knows? I mean, if what you imply here is true (your mom lost all interest in sex, but wouldn't be able to provide for you kids on her own) then it's possible that your dad was doing the *right* thing by having an affair. If his choices were: never have sex again which turns him into a miserable person and makes his relationship with your mom completely toxic, get divorced which financially hurts his wife and children substantially, or have an affair while continuing to be a good provider to his kids, isn't having an affair the least-worst option? 

If you have a conversation with your dad, you have to expect to hear stories that may change how you feel about your mom that you can't un-hear. Although this sub likes to act like cheating is always wrong no matter what, in the real world you often stumble across situations where the victim of the affair isn't the victim in the relationship. That one sentence I quoted above, if accurate, suggests that this *might* be one of those times. 

So it begs a question - what do you expect to get from having a conversation with your dad about this? "
766,He sounds pretty selfish. 
767,Better now than after you're married and saddled with young children. You dodged a bullet.
768,"You should be paying that off whether or not you marry her.  

In her position, I wouldn't marry you even if you were debt-free, because you have a very poor attitude towards money. If you're making 70k a year, why on earth do you have 2.5k in credit card debt?  You should be able to clear that out in a couple of months with no trouble, but seem entirely unconcerned.  

It's not your debt. The debt is just a symptom of the larger problem.  "
769,"Everyone is saying nothing has changed so you aren't allowed to change your level of comfort about their relationship. I disagree.

Reading through your post it's pretty obvious something HAS changed - you've learned new information and gotten a better and closer look at their relationship. Of course even if they haven't changed around each other that doesn't invalidate that what you agreed on to at first cannot be taken back. It's obvious you were a bit too hasty in agreeing with it since the new knowledge and feelings are changing your perspective. That might have been a mistake, but I wouldn't call you a hypocrite for it!

*If a person signs a contract without reading it first, yes they're dumb and naive but definitely not hypocritical after they realize they didn't actually want to sign it when they learn what it entails.*

Sadly you did agree and he was really upfront about it at the start which shows how much she cares about it/her. There are a few possibilities. Either he understands and accepts your feelings on the matter have changed and respects them (seem very unlikely), you deal with their relationship as is or you break up with him if you cannot continue like this."

771,"It definitely sounds like he's tying to have it both ways. To whit, I understand maybe wanting to keep it under wraps that he's dating **you**, but are you saying his ""best friend"" doesn't know he's dating anyone at all?? Because that is not okay. He shouldn't be presenting himself as single to his friend, and if him being attached to anyone at all would ""change the relationship"" he has with her, that implies that the relationship is not a merely platonic one.  "
772,"I agree with all of the top posters here about how to take care of this, but I have to ask, OP-why did you continually allow them to use your pool without your permission?  Why didn't you ever put a stop to that?  "

This does not sound at ALL like ""his first thought is always about how to avoid the kid, how to go out more, how to get away from taking care of the kid.""

This sounds like wanting to maintain a social life with the people who are important to him, rather than giving up on EVERYTHING that is not the kid. Which, by the way, is a thing that some couples do, so it's totally reasonable for him to want to talk about that. 

You know what makes for happy, well-adjusted kids? Happy, well-adjusted parents. And for many parents, that means maintaining some kind of social life that doesn't revolve around the kids.

Your husband sounds like someone who wants to make sure that you'll both be happy and well-adjusted parents, not like someone who wants to get out of having kids or taking care of them. "
776,"Second thought it didn't even start out good.  Dude does not get it at all.

What he can do is stuck up for OP more directly. It already sounds like he has no problem shutting down inappropriate advances, so he just needs to step up his game and tell them off when they make comments about how they'd be more attentive girlfriends. When they say that they'd always go out with them, he should tell them that he prefers a girlfriend who has her own life and hobbies and doesn't need to follow him to every every one of his rugby hangouts because she trusts him.

Here's some tips I wish I knew


1) Get financially dependent as *fast* as you can

2) Make sure you both are not attached to the hip and make space for each other. Go out with friends once in a while

3) Is he ever with his friends or always with you? If he's always with you encourage he goes out.

4) Slow down before you burn out. Living with someone is NOT the same as seeing them here and there. Even if you stayed with each other for a few days here and there

5) Everyone saying ""well we did that and look at us (: "" is NOT how this happened most of the time. Going hard and fast makes people burn out just as quickly.

6) Trust me SLOW DOWN before you burn each other out. He'll always be there the next day. Don't be 2 years ahead of today.

7) Split everything 50-50 as much as possible. Do not let him pay for most of the bills or vise versa

8) SLOW DOWN

Good luck M (;"
796,Please do. Sounds like your kids would be heavily neglected in that case.
797,This is something that she needs to know. What if she wants children later? It would save you both the heartache to tell her now and make that decision.

803,"&gt; That money is going to dry up if she ever talks about a different topic or gets older and less attractive.

Charming.  I don't know what kind of sex blogs you read (although I have a pretty good guess), but there's a surprisingly large segment of women out there who want to know how the toy works *for themselves*, not ogle someone else using it.  Besides, it's not like there's some kind of expiration on her law degree.  If this doesn't work out, she can go back into practice, albeit maybe not at her old firm.  Or find some other career.  The outcomes here aren't limited to job she hates vs. blog followed by failure forever.

That's not to say that you're not entitled to express concerns about this sudden change in lifestyle this would entail, and talk to her about how she plans to make this sustainable or at what point she needs to admit it's not working if it comes to that.  Or whether there's some kind of happy medium where she continues building up the blog while she looks for something with a steady salary that will allow her to exercise more creativity or whatever it is she's not getting at work right now.  But jeez, if you think she's not worth anything besides her looks and a paycheck, why did you even marry her?"

811,"I find it always more than amusing to see, how something nice and awesomr like a feeling of love, turns for everyone into a problem because it often doesn't fit in the precast idea how a relationship or love has to be according to social norms. There is nothing wrong with being attracted to females, to males, to nothing. There is rationally nothing wrong with closed relationships, open relationships or whatever kind of relationship. What I am trying to say is, we can have all kinds of feelings towards all kinds of people and we can have all kinds of relationships with people. Only the people included in this relationship need to figure out if they are okay with it, if they like it, what they want. So stop thinking about you as a gay person and her as a asexual and what that means for you two, start thinking about what you want in life, what you want right now, if you are happy right now why trying to end it? Also, don't stop being her friend, if you used to talk about things and trust eachother, there is no reason why you two should stop doing so now. Why, because you two had coitus? She's your best friend, trust your best friend and talk with her like your best friend, tell her how you feel, that you enjoy it, that you are developing feelings and whatever fears you might have and then listen to your friends words and how she looks at it and maybe at the end you will both laugh about weird feelings and trying to worry about nothing. 
The easiest way to deal with an situation is not forcing things into a made up idea and what you 'think' how things should be, but how you actually feel good about it with that friend/partnet. And honesty."
812,"Yeah, when I was a kid, I used to hold my pee because I didn't want to ask to go to the restroom or was worried that I couldn't fit in a break between class changes. Then one day I laughed too hard and pissed my pants...in high school...

Your title says you've been with your boyfriend 5 months. Were you relationship hopping? Maybe now is not the best time for you to be in a relationship -- which means breaking up, not taking a ""break.""

5 months is a pretty brief relationship to survive 6 months of long distance. Why not just call things off, say you'll talk when you return, and see where each other stands. Maybe you'll want to pick up where you left off, maybe you won't. But this ""break"" thing doesn't work. If you guys were somehow fated to be together, wouldn't that happen anyway?

It's perfectly okay to call off a relationship just because you want to be single. "

The good personal references from previous top tier supervisors cinches it."

827,"So, he didn't want to play a game when you wanted to play it, he didn't want to run an errand (and you didn't explicitly say you needed him out for a birthday surprise), he took offense at you complaining outloud under your breath (what you were you saying?) and he didn't like being woken up from a nap.

Sounds like he is tired, you're getting pissy because he's not cooperating, but you're also not explaining why you need his cooperation, and then he's getting grumpier in reaction. He shouldn't be so grumpy, but it doesn't sound like you're handling this so well either. If he didn't want to do the errand, it is easy enough to roll with it and later say, ""why don't you rest for a bit, and don't come out of the bedroom! It's a surprise."" It sounds like both of your moods are feeding off each other. "
828,"I have a lot of experience with eating disorders. I think that the thing that most people here are missing is that there's a **big** difference between *what she should do* and *what you should say to her*. Yes, it would be helpful to her to stop looking at tumblrs and to go see a therapist, but that doesn't mean that it would be helpful for her to hear you tell her to do those things. She already knows that she should be doing them, and eating disorders are often about control, and by telling her what to do (even though you have the best of intentions) you risk turning this into a power struggle. You'd also make her feel like she can't talk to you about it.

I strongly implore you to RESIST the urge to give her advice or tell her your opinions. This is about what *she* thinks and feels. Instead of pushing your viewpoint onto her, show her that you want to understand her's. Ask her questions with a non-judgmental tone. Here are some questions to ask when it seems like she's thinking about ED stuff:

* ""How are you feeling about your body today?"" 

* ""How does that make you feel about your body?"" 

* ""What is it about this [image or behavior] that you find appealing?"" 

* ""What is your goal?"" 

* ""What can I do to support you?"" 

Remember, your tone should be judgment-free. You should sound caring and interested, not accusatory. If you start to give her advice or tell her your own opinions, she will shut down and stop talking to you, maybe permanently, so it's very important to keep it to yourself. The goal here is to get her to talk about her feelings and thoughts. By hearing herself talk about it out loud, she can work through this stuff on her own. Your role is to listen and provide comfort and a safe space for her to work through her feelings. 

Good luck!"
829,I disagree. It's a dating website. Chilling is still a date.
830,"I'm sorry but I disagree. I'm so glad you don't feel hurt about it but the point still stands that he shows a lack of respect for consent and that needs to be stamped out as hard as possible so that the habit doesn't escalate. I think you need to speak to his guardians, and threaten to contact the cops. If hes done it to you this time then chances are hes done before which means he thinks this behaviour is at all okay and that needs to end."
831,Maybe stop stringing along the current girl you're dating and be single for a while to figure out what you want. It doesn't sound like you should be throwing the GF tag around so loosely with someone you're not showing respect. 
832,"Hmm. Tricky.

But as I say - WHY are her kids so heinous? At least in part because of her, surely? She cannot be the golden angel you imagine, she just cant. (yes, sometimes great people have shitty kids and vice versa, but rarely)

833,"Please do!! If you really focus on it, I promise you that it won't be a waste of money or time. It might make you feel sexier too, which is always nice :) "
834,"Ah yes, someone busts in to normalize sexual assault, something something rape culture doesn't exist, boys will be boys, etc etc etc.

No, OP doesn't need to talk to the man who sexually assaulted in her in order to give him a chance to ""explain himself"".

Yup, long term emotional trauma! C'est la vie though, right?"

838,"If, say, you'd had a big party, it went missing, and you concluded that the one Latino guest had probably stolen it, I'd agree that that was a racist assumption. But in this case I think it makes sense to be suspicious since it sounds like she's the only other person besides you and your girlfriend with access to your home and belongings.

841,"I remember watching a film - and I don't know how accurate it is - about feeders whose ultimate fantasy was a woman who's so fat she's completely incapacitated and can't do anything at all for herself. 

There's being open-minded and accepting, and then there's literally killing yourself to satisfy your SO's kinks. 

Let's also remember that he could have tried to find a woman who's already very large - the process of fattening her up is clearly important to him. "
842,"This is going to sound really scary and you might not like it. 

You don't have to go to college right out of HS. You can leave and find work, live with roommates, and figure out student loans on your own. You just have to realize that you control yourself and it might be a scary, big world, where you don't get everything you want... at the time you want it.

But freedom from religious parents might mean not having them in your life."
843,"Yes and the bigger part of the manipulation is that OP needs to be forgiven for something, she did nothing wrong. "
844,I legit teared up reading that. So awesome. 
845,"His words say that he wants a mature relationship. His behavior says that he doesn't want a mature relationship and actually wants to do immature things like stay out all night partying. He is saying one thing and doing another. When that happens, go based on the behavior, not the words. "
846,"&gt;When I'm taking my medication I'm mostly fine but I still need to be very careful. 2 years ago I petitioned for my brother to become my guardian as I really needed him to take care of me. If I go off of my medication I become unpredictable and I need someone to force me back and limit the damage I can do. Even on medication I sometimes need a kick in the butt. That's why he's my guardian. He can do those things.

Like I said, OP and her brother know much more about OP's bipolar disorder than anyone on this forum can."

If she was raised in Honduras (seems it might be the case) then she was probably raised believing in much more traditional male/female roles than are common in the US today.

855,"The only reason you should be divorcing your wife is if you're unhappy being married to her. Saying you're doing it solely because you think it'll be better for your child is a bullshit excuse.

&gt; As we got the subway back home on Sunday so that our daughter could be home for 6 to meet Mommy the parallels between the sitaution and that which I grew up in in terms of my divorced folks hit home; as soon as I got in the front door I had no involvement in our daughter from then on, just like when my dad dropped me off on Sunday evening when I stayed with him on weekends.

This right here is bullshit. The only thing stopping you from being her father when your wife is around is yourself. The only thing stopping you from taking your daughter out (just the two of you) and having father/daughter time while your wife is home is yourself.

You want to divorce your wife because you think she's preventing you from being the parent you want to be? Unless she's locking your daughter in her room and not allowing you access to her, then guess what? She's not. You are.

You want to divorce your wife because you're unhappy being married to her? Then do that. **Don't** put that blame on your daughter's head, that's just cruel."
856,loool please don't say hahaha awkward 😂😂😭😭
857,"That last line is the real issue. 

Also, if you spend a $100 cash on an item for your place it washes out and you just tell your mom what you bought. I understand being upset she didn't talk to you about it first but really it's not as a big of a deal as you are making it. "
858,"I love my mom but I could not have her live in my home. You see perfect homemaker but maybe husband sees a woman who'd move in and take over. Maybe he knows they would clash personality wise.

This all could have been avoided by speaking to your husband first and hashing it out between the two of you. You've put your husband in a really awkward position.

Backtrack on this and speak to him on what he's willing to do for his mom. Can you two afford to help her out with a small studio apartment for a bit as an alternative to her living with you? That sort of thing. You're going to get nowhere railroading your husband on this and MIL is going to end up even more hurt. You and your husband have to sort this out between the two of you first and you'll probably have to compromise."

Even when you have the most amazing picture of someone, that everyone else fawns over, they'll find something to hate in it.

864,"So the way you *are* trying to sound is ""I want to take things slow because I feel shitty about putting out too soon. 



The way you sound to a guy is ""I used to put out really easily for any attractive bad boy.  But now that I'm done with them, I'm gonna make the actual respectful guys like you wait, because you're stable but don't turn me on as much.""  




Your reasoning is valid and okay (at least I wouldn't be mad at it, but that's opinion).  But I understand how a guy is gonna feel slighted and leave being told they're being denied something you gave to other guys who treated you worse, because of, as they see it, those guys who treated you worse.

869,"&gt; Lastly, I'd be wary about anyone who says ""kids will be good for our marriage!"" 

No kidding.  As a married guy with kids, the kids make it harder, not easier.  I love my kids, I love my wife and I wouldn't change a thing, but to think that kids make marriage better/easier is laughable.  "

871,"Your daycare workers are not being paid $2.50 an hour salary, so that's not a fair comparison. I don't mean to be belligerent but $1.50 per hour is not just a poor wage, it's disrespectful of her time. It doesn't matter if your kid is sleeping, *he is in her care.* The wage is so inappropriately low that her experience level doesn't even factor in. She could be an ovum and I'd still think it was preposterous. Please consider paying her more. At least minimum wage."
872,"My thoughts exactly. There is no way the rest of their relationship is peachy if this issue has persisted for 20 years.

873,"You deliberately deceived this guy into marriage. I'd be pissed too.

Blackmailing isn't fair in any way, but that being said he is well within his rights to just tell people what he knows anyway.

You are in a very tough spot here. I would say a big thing to keep in mind is that if you agree to take nothing and divorce, he can still tell everyone once the divorce is finalized. This past is probably going to catch up to you no matter what, so I would try to get out ahead of it, and I would contest the divorce."
874,"If I were in this position, I'd probably just sleep in my kid's bedroom for now, at least assuming your son is a baby or toddler (which I assume is the case because you mentioned moving him out of your bedroom). Then at some point in the future if you end up moving to a bigger place, I would make it a priority to get a place with an extra bedroom, or other extra space where one of you can sleep. "
875,"I know it feels hard to believe, but it's totally true! I'm your age and know MANY eligible bachelors who cook and clean and hold down steady jobs, and most of them have complained to me about how hard it is to find women to date. Living in a large, liberal city helps--if you're far away from an urban hub, pickings will be slimmer and people will probably settle down younger, but that's no reason to settle for this guy.

Dating in your late 20s isn't going to be like dating in college. You don't have to guess at whether or not your partner is capable of becoming a mature adult, you can already see whether they've managed to do it."

As someone who has an advanced degree, I made some shitty decisions based on a relationship too. The relationship didn't last.

881,"Ok I'm just throwing this out there: the best sex I ever had was with a guy who literally looked like someone split him down the middle, moved the right side up about an inch, and then fit him back together. His charm and wit drew me in, made him attractive to me, and then the sex made him the most attractive person EVER, in my eyes. I mean, I didn't think he was sexy at first at all but his weird asymmetrical self was directly related to THE BEST SEX EVER so he became sexy as fuck. Just a picture of him turned me on. It wasn't that he was necessarily the most attractive guy but he was inextricably linked to ""holy shit mind-blowing sex"" in my head and thus he became indescribably sexy, and he became someone I lusted after pretty much 24/7. 

So I think this poster might have a point; you don't have to be attractive to be sexy to someone. Maybe work on the sex part of it? "
882,"No you cannot stay with us. Why? Because I'm so sick of the way you treat me and I don't want you in my home so I can hear more about how I'm a bad person for acting like a person with a conscience. My sister, who also treats me poorly, committed a felony using MY HUSBAND'S financial information. Guess what, we now have to prove we're innocent because she's a criminal. And you STILL defend her and treat me like I'm one guilty of something. You are pressuring me to forgive her.

How naive are you good sir? 

Miron (more like moron) was making FUN of you and suggested your gf should make you wear women's cloth. Dude. Have you thought about the way your gf must refer and speak about you to him, for him to make such a mocking joke out of you? 

I can see you are in denial, but for how long are you going to deny the clear reality. Your gf is cheating on you and you plan to marry her. 

If she does not leave you, I guess she is comfortable to let you pay for shit and buy her gifts. It seems that's all you are good for, for her. 

What's more, from the messages that you found to her friends it's CLEAR everyone knows you are being cheated on and used. 

""I was a nice girl ;)!"" 

My God... She really is using you and laughing her ass off.

Cut all contact and especially don't let them get at the younger ones who are more vulnerable.  You're not being selfish, they are grown adults who are able to take care of themselves.

900,"Is it horrible that I would straight up lie? Especially considering that after just a month together you realised how much you liked her. It isn't worth risking your relationship for this.


Honestly, I would downgrade it to something like ""when I first saw Michelle on the first day of college I thought she was hot, but then I actually got to know you both and I fell for you"". Or maybe just say that your mate thinks Michelle is hot and is just stirring the pot. Lying to your partner is shitty and not ideal, but this would really really hurt her."

But (you knew there was a 'but'), I think this one is just a hard limitation of hers, and you may have to accept that what she's doing isn't personal, and it's not about you. Watching new stuff makes her panicky, and not in a good way. I wouldn't want to 'just try' new stuff either under those circumstances if I were her.

An analogy: I have a few friends who have the reaction to cilantro that makes it taste like soap. I love cilantro. I love tons of dishes that involve cilantro. And when I was young and dumb, I'd offer cilantro-y dishes to these friends and feel hurt when they kept saying no. Part of me wanted to say, ""oh, try it. It's amazing. There's not that much cilantro"". But why on earth *would* they want to try it? They *know* they're just going to get a mouthful of soap.

So too with your girlfriend. And I think this will get better if you stop thinking of this as her 'not giving things a chance' and more as her 'having a serious limitation'. It still sucks (and, as a side note, I think having her be more aggressive about reading summaries and finding ones she might want to see could help) in that it means she's never going to be a great movie partner, but hopefully it will sting less."

Do you have plans for college or vocational training that would allow you to become financially independent and enjoy fulfilling work?

Do you have any experience with dating and making relationships between equals work?

I'm sure this won't be helpful to you now, but the best thing you can do for yourself is leave this dude and go live your own life, grow into your adulthood on your own, find out what kind of person you are on your own.

Why is that? The attitude that female victims of DV are at fault is *common*. 

Hell, look at the Johnny Depp Amber Heard case; he only settled when Heard released two hidden camera videos of him actively being violent. It's an open and shut case, but *people are still blaming her.* Notice how it's nowhere on the front page like the original lawsuit was? This is normal. This is default. People who don't blame female victims are the outsiders.

916,"&gt; I want to tell her off but I don't know what good that would do. 

DON'T do this. I know it will give you some small satisfaction, but it will also be a terrible decision for the following reasons:

* ANY form of communication (good or bad) will be a victory for her. See the way she's trying to force you to respond by alternatingly being nice and then being mean? That basically means she doesn't mean ANYTHING that she says. It's all a ploy to try to elicit a response, ANY response (even an angry/upset one) from you. Persistent exes and stalkers often use this tactic. Giving in is **only encouraging the behavior**. If you give in after 20 texts, then next time she knows that you don't have the willpower to ignore her. She just has to text enough and you'll give in. 

* You will get NOTHING out of the exchange. Like I just said, *she doesn't mean any of this.* Not the good stuff, and not the bad stuff. Everything she says is just emotional manipulation to try to get you to pay attention to her. That means, if you actually engage, there will be *no real closure or understanding.* She's not interested in speaking honestly about what happened, or about your future. She's still acting out of selfish impulse and an urge for attention (only this time, it's yours). If you engage now, the most you will get is a lot of BS. 

* She doesn't care about you. Again, if she was remorseful, she wouldn't be sending those bitter messages. It's all BS BS BS. She cares about HERSELF. She doesn't want to apologize to you; she wants the burden of guilt lifted off her shoulders. She doesn't miss you; she misses the feeling of being wanted and knowing she has power over you. "
917,"Maybe it's just sexting...but yea I wouldn't bet money on it. And even if it is just sexting, still extremely wrong and hurtful. "
918,"Well if he's innocent he does. If he's guilty the forensic examiner will just say the charges are legitimate, and dude will just be throwing away his family's money. So if your dad has any hesitation about hiring experts, you probably should just assume that he has good reasons."

Listen to your girlfriend. She is a smart woman.

Why are you still torturing yourself with these people, OP?"
920,"Exactly what I was thinking. Although ""known each other"" is pretty vague- if they were close friends for several years this behavior makes a LITTLE more sense but if they were just in the same friend group/peripheral acquaintances, this is literally insane behavior. 

Either way, he needs to get over himself or OP needs to dump him."
921,"The fact that you've gone out several times, kissed, noticed he was hard, etc all make me think that he's *very* in to you and clearly the things you're worried about are not important to him at all. That's a good thing! Try to relax and enjoy it :)

And to give one guy's perspective, I usually tend to be attracted to women who are about as tall as me. A few of the women I've dated have been taller than me too. Everyone is attracted to different things."
922,"A promissory note is enforceable under the law if done correctly which OP said they would get. Also OP said they would charge interest on the note which is also enforceable. So basically if OP sets a date of repayment and they default it's off to court they go. Each promissory note works differently under contract and what not and if OP does go down this route (which I would tell them to suck a fat one personally) then OP should be covered. If I were OP I would get in contact with a lawyer that knows about commercial paper (which a primmisory notes falls under) and go from there. This is all stuff I learned in business law (took it a year or so ago.) so speak to a lawyer for more in depth info. 

And yes please avoid telling them your net worth and about how much money you have because it will only get worse. 

Good luck op"

I think they need counseling. "
928,A lot of signs of depression were mentioned in the OP. Combine a history of depression and a sudden tragedy and suicide becomes a real concern.
929,"&gt;  I'm just learning at 31 that their behavior isn't normal and I'm actually not a walking piece of shit! 

Congrats on this, OP. It's a huge step. I had a similar family dynamic being the scapegoat to my older sister, the golden child. Going no-low contact with your parents and sister may be the best thing for your own mental health. Also google ""medium chill"". No need to engage these people in their drama."
930,"If you had five thousand dollars somehow in December, it should go towards a security deposit and rent for your own place, not to this bastard. 

Sorry about your mom. I have one of those, too. Cutting her out is the best thing I ever did for myself. "
931,"OP, 26 years old isn't 'young'.  You're officially in your 'late twenties' at that age (I mean yes you guys got married and had children really young - but by this stage you're 'old enough' to have a handle on being an adult, however crappily you are at it).

Also your husband sounds like your fifth child.  If you aren't exaggerating, he's literally failing at being your partner and is instead an additional responsibility you care for, along with the rest of your kids.

Does he do any parenting with you? I mean, I don't want to say 'babysitting' because he's the father, it isn't babysitting, it's parenting, but basically, does he 'babysit' the children or are you the only caretaker as well?

I'm going to break, at this point, to say that by about age 23, your brain has definitely stopped developing.  The person you are at that stage is basically who you are short of trauma or some huge, giant shock or concentrated work to change.  How long have all your friends been saying that 'once he mans up he'll be a great husband'? If its been longer than a year (i.e. his behaviour hasn't gotten worse, it's always been this bad) then I wouldn't put much hope on him 'manning up' (or growing up) on his own accord.

Anyway, if the above all rings true, and you want to stick around and try to make your marriage work, then my suggestion is to try and give him that big sharp traumatic shock that hopefully makes him grow the fuck up.

Basically leave him to cope with being an adult on his own for [x] months.  Tell him he needs to grow up and until he does, you're leaving him.  Take the kids, move somewhere else (go back to your family if you can, you're probably going to need help with 4 kids) and get on with your life.

If he can change, he'll grow up then.  

And if he doesn't - well that's your answer.

I think it's perfect."
933,"If your wife is polite to and good to all of your friends except this one friend, I would take her word for it that this friend is exceptionally unpleasant to be around. If your wife was trying to cut you off from all your friends that would be a different story.

There may be a better way to word it but the basic idea is to indicate your flexibility but make it clear it was never your decision to not spend the funds necessary to make the system better."
935,"OP, take some time for yourself. Don't reach out to him now. First things first: Make an app't and see a dr to check on the IUD and make sure it isn't an ectopic pregnancy, as someone already advised. 

Then if it isn't ectopic, decide for yourself if you're ready to have this baby. If you decide to keep the baby, then it is appropriate to tell this ex. Don't go bringing him in right now -- you're the pregnant one, you're the one who is in turmoil and was recently dumped, you've got to give yourself a little space to know your own mind.

937,"To be honest, I'd break up with you too. 

The fact that you love her but don't feel comfortable saying it, to the point that she's ready to leave, means that you have some serious intimacy and commitment issues. 

How are you working towards getting to the point where you can comfortably say, ""I love you""? Are you in therapy? Are you reading self help books? Are you writing her letters in which you write that you love her, and explain how scared you are? 

Why shouldn't she leave you if she has no proof that you're working on your issues? It's a waste of time for her to go out on a limb and offer you her heart when you've made it clear that you're not willing to go out on a limb and offer we your heart. "

The next time you find yourself entertaining ideas of a relationship, examine how a person treats you right from the beginning. Right from the beginning, you gave more. You did it his way right from the start. Learn the lessons you have to from this unequal and shitty partnership and move on. Be single for awhile. Get over this lazy man and start aiming higher. You teach people how to treat you, and if you hadn't accepted the tiny crumbs he gave you right from the start, you wouldn't have moved to him or been in this relationship. Next time, stand up for yourself and what YOU NEED AND WANT.

When she does, I'd go with an angle of concern, asking if something's bothering her that she'd like to talk about. Don't offer advice or solutions unless she specifically asks, just say you want to listen to whatever she has to say, then do so.

955,"Building on this, buy a beautiful setting set with a cheaper gemstone, then replace the gemstone with a diamond or different stone when you're ready, if you're able to spend a few hundred on a ring right now. Another commenter said Etsy, you'll find loads there, many with pave diamonds (although those would be getting close to real-ring costs) but set with CZ, sapphire or Moissanite which is much cheaper. 

EDIT: some people seem to do these upgrades anyway on occasions; no reason she can't wear a cheaper ring while you're students, and upgrade for your 5th anniversary or something."

How is this not taking care of you? Doing *one* of those things would be taking care of you. Doing all of those things is above and beyond. 

Most friends don't stop by a sick friend's house to clean it. It's very nice, it's very thoughtful, and, yes, it is very caring."

961,"Yeesh. I'm Chinese, and this girl is either Shanghainese or crazy (the stereotype is that Shanghainese girls are extraordinarily, unreasonably demanding and spoiled). They were four weeks into a relationship. Even a Chinese person realizes how much work goes into a wedding, and most do not want to lose face by requiring their significant other badger their friend for an invite. I can't honestly think of any ""cultural"" reasons why you would shoehorn your way into a new boyfriend's friend's wedding, unless she's really old (by Asian standards) and wanted convincing pictures to get her family off her back, or just a major commitment for her own peace of mind? Maybe she's one of those super entitled nouveau riche....

I'll ask my mom, she's more traditional than I am. But still...

I asked my mom (and she's like old school), and said there was nothing at all culturally relevant to the situation (the whole only dating for four weeks thing applies), so lets not give Chinese culture a bad name here. Girl's either seriously misunderstood the situation, using it as an excuse, or guy's just being a tit. I vote for the latter. I also hope, if she was planning on coming because ""it's cultural"", she was prepared to bring the traditional Chinese wedding gift, which is 2/whatever the wedding costs rounded up to the nearest eight. 

Either way, none of this excuses your friend. He's dating cross culturally, and it's up to him to make it work and impose boundaries, or sacrifice everything else to appease his girlfriend. She's crossed a major boundary, or he's pushing it for her, and no amount of cultural ""sensitivity"" makes that okay."
962,"I'd also be wondering (assuming he really has made bank while away) what he's doing, because I am willing to bet it's something shady as hell, if not straight-up illegal. You don't just waltz into a job that's high-paid enough to count you as ""wealthy"" two years in, when you have no way of providing references and so on."
963,"&gt; The BIL for comforting OP, all the while actually knowing the truth...

I would try to verify this part before just accepting the information in the letter. The husband can't be trusted, obviously, and it's possible he's making up the part about his brother being in on it for some crazy reason. If BIL has been a good friend to OP and a good uncle to the kids for the past 2 years, I wouldn't want to implode that relationship on the basis of the husband's word alone. I have no idea how you verify this, however, unless the BIL straight-up admits to it."

And why you jumped to the bride default was sort of strange, absolutely no one used that as an excuse. But you yourself talk about balancing the wants of both members of a relationship, and does this really seem like a balanced compromise to you?"

972,"Cheating is more that just physical sex, you know. You stepped outside the bounds of your marriage, which makes your actions cheating. I mean, would you have been okay with your wife emailing, soliciting, and trading pictures with other men? 

Until you're willing to fully accept your responsibility and stop minimizing your actions, your wife has no reason to even start trusting you again.

Edit: rereading your post, it sounds like you're more sorry you got caught than sorry you cheated. She's right not to trust you."
973,"You have a chance to make things right and be a father to your son. Not many people are given a second chance; I suggest you take it.

My dad used to work with a guy that did the same thing you did; abandoned his kid and didn't speak to them for upwards of 20 years. 23 years later, seized with regret, he tried to reach out and have a relationship with that kid, only to be crushed when that kid wanted nothing to do with him. He died from terminal illness with his kid refusing to have anything to do with him. He confessed to my dad that his one regret was never having anything to do with his child, and that if he had the choice, he would have done it differently.

You're insecure about being a good father to your son, which, given your history, I can somewhat understand. But don't make the same mistakes your father did. Think about how not having a father made you feel, and use that as motivation to be better. "
974,"Bouncing off this, my parents were married but my dad never should have had kids. I struggled for years to try to connect with him and got let down over and over and over again. I really wish he'd either been there completely or not at all. In between hurt worse. I'm 28 now. Lived with him until 16. Haven't talked to him for over a year at a time. And barely connect with him. Sometimes no dad is better than a shitty dad.

978,"First of all, how do you know he was there for me? He was but you're making assumptions. I nearly died with TWO of my miscarriages. Our babies were wanted. Our kids now are loved. We love each other. Until you've had to pick your dead baby out of the toilet you shouldn't be judging what other people do in similar situations. "
979,"OP IS A CIRCUS PERFORMER. That is why she's having a circus themed wedding, not to entertain random children that she actively dislikes! Do you not see how condescending and rude your comment is? ""Your profession is basically for kids anyway"" like are you serious? Who made you the arbiter of what adults are allowed to enjoy and engage in?"
980,"Best solution here. This is feasible (assuming OP's company isn't protected against it, very few are), and allows OP to avoid the issue entirely. She could also print the email + metadata, but that's easier for her company to trace back to her."
981,"Yeah she's just malingering and a hypochondriac. She hasn't been diagnosed with anything or she'd mention it. Her post history mentions her telling friends she thinks she's dying. Yet no actual symptoms or diagnosis she's revealing. 

Huntington's and MS are wildly different diseases. Not to mention there isn't just one test for MS. It doesn't work like that. If her doctor even suspected MS they wouldn't be just sitting sitting around for ages waiting for a referral to an auto immune specialist. If she was going to see any kind of specialist it would be a neurologist. 

If she's a ""borderline celiac"" then she probably shouldn't be constantly posting in /r/randomactsofpizza asking for pizza. 

If she hasn't even been diagnosed with anything why is she so concerned telling her date that she's going to have a short life span? All of her answers and posts are just her speculating. "

Because you don't want it to get back to Ann that you don't find her physically attractive. She doesn't deserve that - she accepted your tactful rejection gracefully.

Your friends are being jerks about it. They certainly deserve a harsh response like, ""Let's see YOU date someone you aren't attracted to!"" but Ann doesn't need that. If she was acting like a wounded, entitled Nice Guy, she would.

Tell them to stay out of it. Ask them if they really think they're helping Ann."
985,"That seems somewhat money focused to me. An old-school, and honestly pretty minimal, type of family support to be proud of doing.

If he's not there emotionally, or even physically since he's out of the house a lot, he might be overly-proud of the financial contribution specifically because he doesn't contribute emotionally or physically. He over-compensates and is 'proud' about the thing he does contribute to cover up the things he doesn't contribute."

He's sponging off you with toiletries etc. 

You need to tell him no.  If he doesn't like it you need to find a new housemate. 

You already knew all this though. "
992,"Having spent time in the ME myself, I agree with /u/MidnightMalaga. 

I know your husband is making a shitload of money, but perhaps it's time to leave that awful place when his contract is up. The money isn't worth living in that barbaric culture and your kids will be better off growing up in the states. I'm sure you've figured out by now that all their wealth, shiny skyscrapers, and fancy jewelry is built upon corruption, fossil fuels, and the subjugation of others. He's obviously well educated and good at what he does, as Arabs try to hire the best, so I have no doubt he can get a good salary elsewhere. Time to gtfo.

993,"I'm pretty stubborn and hate being told ""what I want"" or whatever, so I probably would be like, ""Go ahead and do it, but no matter what if it's more than just me there I'm saying no, I don't care how much I actually want to marry you at the time. You humiliate me, I humiliate you. Fair's fair."""
994,"I realize this isn't very helpful, but from an outside perspective that sub is pretty hilarious. Also it's very inactive, the top post is from like 6 months ago and the rest are older than that, so at least it's not like an active community that he could get more deeply involved with. "
995,"The fact that you can even still talk to your mother is honestly rather amazing.

You say he makes her happy. But ask yourself -- if a man you dated EVER hurt someone in your family, could you possibly be happy with him?

Most people, that would be an instant and resounding ""no,"" but your mother decided that someone who hurt her child is okay to keep dating.

So please don't feel guilty. The fact that you're capable of still talking to her after that is already more than she deserves -- don't let her make you believe she deserves any more. She made her choice. "
996,"Going to the family events is what makes her a psychopath.  OP dodged a huge bullet, but his friends and family will not see it."

998,"Out of curiosity, how did he persuade you to have a ""half-open"" relationship? That is just so...no. I mean, maybe if one partner has a very low libido and the other has a very high one, I can sorta see it working? But it just sounds like it fits into the rest of your relationship where he has freedom and you have responsibilities. "
999,"Most of these comments are only skimming the surface and ignoring the greater issue that black women are regularly devalued in media representation and in person through daily microagressions or blatant bigotry. You can't just ignore the fact that the very features that people consider unattractive on black women (bigger butt, lips, etc) are hailed as beautiful and exotic on a woman of another race. So it's not just as simple as Oh, he just has a type. He has friends that say they would never date a black woman. Not any other races, just black women. That right there says that his friends have negative, preconceived notions about black women and that he accepts their views. He may not share them (maybe) but he doesn't have a problem with it, even though you, his future wife, are black. That's just crazy to me. The company you keep reflects on you and it is not showing a pretty reflection of your fiance. I dont know if you want kids, but if you do, think of a future daughter who turns out very dark skinned and her father doesnt think people that look like her are attractive.  I am not saying you should break up, but you should do some serious soul searching and probably couples counseling. I couldn't be with anyone who doesn't love and fully respect my culture."
1000,You're trotting out bible syllogisms like you're high up in the pulpit. gtfo with your bullshit. 
1001,"I definitely think he's trying to get something going with her based on what you wrote.  She's toeing the line to having an emotional affair with this guy, even though it hasn't gone romantic or sexual yet.  I'd definitely have a discussion with her about your feelings, and about her setting firm boundaries with this guy.

I'm going to do what others like to do on this sub and flip the script.  Ask her how she'd feel if it were you, and a woman you had admitted to having an attraction to started coming by your desk 2-3 times a day, sent you emails all day long, brought you gifts and cake, and once even reached up and wiped a smudge off your cheek (akin to the skirt thingie).  

I'm guessing your fiancée would probably be a little pissed.  The problem here is, due to your girlfriend's past relationship, you feel like you have to approach it with kid gloves on.  If you go in guns blazing and tell her ""I don't like this guy - you need to cut off contact - he's trying to sleep with you!"", she'll probably shut down.

If you let her know how it makes you FEEL, and that it's damaging your relationship with her, hopefully she'll understand and realize she needs to set new boundaries with the guy.

Good luck."

1004,"It's not that he'd lie - more so that his perception of their interactions might not be the same as hers.  He doesn't necessarily seem willing to back off of this either, and living with your parents or not is kind of a binary question, so there isn't a ton of room for compromise.

I mean, suppose he starts with ""hey I want my parents to move in when they're old"" and she follows up with ""I don't want to do that"".  Where does a rational, compromise-oriented conversation go from there?  Either they live there or they don't."
1005,"So, if he started acting suspiciously, you'd just break it off with him for suspiciousness? Assuming you had talked to him and found the explanation lacking, of course."
1006,"People like OP that are into fitness never just post once. It's like every other day or several times a week and we lack the ability to see any change in their bodies. Like here's a picture of someone's thigh ""leg day is really paying off"". Is it paying off? Who knows? But at the end of the day I have to look at unsolicited photos of someones body parts. As far as photography goes these photos are not interesting and the fact that I am being prompted to praise them for it is also pretty grating. 

 And it goes on with other types of posts that aren't even about progress ""I love my new workout leggings"", ""I am so sweaty"", ""eating right today"", all of this is just kind of virtue signaling and calling for more attention. Look at my body! Look at my sweaty face! Check out how healthy I'm being!

Because of the way you have described the girls' actions toward you, though, I am inclined to think that most of this is in your mind. Like, one girl invites you over but then doesn't include you in conversation and you think it's an attack? Or another gives you bad advice like any person and you think it's an attack? Or one tries to befriend you because you're befriending her boyfriend and you think it's drama? "

&gt;The only way a postnuptual agreement would prevent her divorcing you is if it's not in her favor.

If she's in a state where spousal support kicks in at 10 years, the postnup might prevent her from divorcing him now. She might be thinking that she's willing to work on the marriage, but only with the guarantee that she won't be financially screwed if it still falls apart. Otherwise she'll save herself the trouble and just divorce now. "

1017,"Sounds as though you've done your best. For now, give your daughter and son a bit of space to manage their relationship. You've clearly given them some solid examples of boundary setting and asking for respect. At the age of 20 and 22, they should be given some space to learn and practice those skills themselves with their siblings.

It's understandable that your daughter is hesitant to talk to you about her boyfriend right now, and that her relationship with her brother is strained. These are not unfair feelings for either of them to be having. There is nothing you can, or should, try to do about that.

It would be better I think to view your role as an advisor, rather than a moderator. If you are uncomfortable, talk to them about your own discomfort, and model honesty in that way. Don't make assumptions or accusations about the nature of their own feelings. 

Your question doesn't make this sound like it's a crisis, just a change. Don't try to fix it for them. Just give them some guidance by talking about your feelings about what happened and what the impact has been on you."
1018,"Yes I understand why you'd feel uncomfortable. But they are all adults. Your sister can make consensual decisions on her own. Yes she told you. So, what now? Well there's nothing you can do now. Because even though your sister called you up and told you, it's still technically non of you business.

If they were harassing her about it and she needed your help, yes then you could step in and make it your business.

I think a lot of this anger is stemming from jealousy. You are VERY angry about this and it seems a little much. I think you're overreacting. They're not doing anything illegal, they're not doing anything unethical. In fact what they're doing is amazing and they're doing it in a very safe and stable way.

Not to be harsh, but you kind of need to start getting over it."
1019,yes! a very good example. you can talk about your personal life and even make fun of your loved ones without being evil about it. i'm also thinking of Aziz Ansari's bits about his cousins Harris and Dinesh (I think those were their names). Unbelievably funny without being too mean.
1020,"I don't think confrontation is the best idea here! That's what she wants! More drama, more ways to twist what you're saying! 

 I think you should treat it like it's boring. This girl is looking for a reaction, any reaction will do...so give her nothing. 

Treat it like she's an annoying older relative who is going on and on and on and on about the trip she took last October; you feel badly for Aunt Marjorie, she's lonely and this is the only exciting thing that has happened to her in years,  you have to humor her because you love her, but you're bored out of your mind. 

""Huh"" + subject change, ""mmm"" +subject change. Vague facial expression, like you're a million miles away. If the subject changes organically, visibly perk up and start engaging.

1022,What are you even talking about? Most people don't decide to marry a person before they even date them. Which does not mean they have decided they are *not* going to marry a person before they even date them. Dating is a way to get to know someone and find out if you are compatible. It's also a way to get a relationship practice or even just to have fun and companionship if you are not yet ready for marriage or for a long-term commitment.
1023,"Well, your options are not caving, being trapped, or hoping marriage counseling can salvage something. 

You aren't going to get a easy conversation where she just agrees. You'll have to be the bad guy."

You can't know how long your relationship is going to last from the point you'd be living together in the UK. If you break up (quite a possibility), you'll end up frustrated that you didn't choose the uni when you had the chance. Even if you don't break up, it is high chance that you'll resent him for being in the way of your career. 

Always choose yourself and education.
