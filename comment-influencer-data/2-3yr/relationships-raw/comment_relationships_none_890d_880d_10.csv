Even then, if I knew I tracked fur into someone's car/home I would clean it."
1,You need to have a come-to-jesus conversation with him and let him know that this was completely unacceptable....and that showing off for his buddies should never *ever* ***ever*** be at your expense

3,"&gt; I know this sounds dramatic but my eye was sore for a good day and half afterwards.

Um, I mean, I know what's in Tabasco sauce (vinegar, salt, and tabasco pepper puree) so no, it doesn't sound ""dramatic""; you were basically *maced.* Chili peppers burn in the mouth because the capsaicin irritates soft tissues; people who merely *handle* certain extremely-hot peppers and then accidentally rub their eyes can wind up in the ER.

This is why people fucking grow out of dumb pranking. Somebody gets hurt - in this case it was you.

&gt; I don't want to be s drama queen but is this something that I can get past?

You're fully in your rights to decide whether you're past it or not. If it seems like he's genuinely admonished and swearing off pranks forever, then maybe you can accept that he's had a learning experience. On the other hand, if you've always kind of been like ""pranks are dumb and put people at risk"", and then he went and pranked you anyway, then I don't know if he should get to come back from this. If he knew you didn't like pranks and thought they were dumb and put people at risk of getting seriously hurt (and you were pretty seriously hurt, there's no reason to minimize it) and did it anyway, then he's got one hell of an ""I told you so, now GTFO"" coming to him, don't you think?"
4,"No, that is way too much involvement with the sex life of teenagers.  Gross, gross, gross."
5,"&gt;so I've decided to move on from it. 

Except you're dwelling on it by having it to decide how to 'do' your birthdays. You clearly haven't moved on from it.

If you refuse to celebrate birthdays you're forcing them to forever be associated with the few times you attempted to celebrate them and rejecting any potentionally good memories to form from it. "
6,"DO NOT IGNORE IT
SHE WILL NOTICE IT

tell her you messed up because their birthdays are close but you feel really dumb now that Facebook notified you. Then talk about what you had planned for her birthday so she feels special and can see you really were thinking about her. It will make her feel a lot better than realizing what you did on her own."
7,"You're still not fully taking responsibility for your actions and mistakes which worries me that you'll make a selfish mistake like this again. Cause that was the problem - your selfishness, not lack of communication. "
8,"When I was pregnant, I cried when my husband spilled my box of fried shrimp onto the floor. I was craving them so bad that day. They say you're not supposed to eat shrimp during pregnancy, so maybe that was a sign."
9,"It sounds like she held a grudge about your husband's treatment of her sister and did her best to ruin his marriage on his wedding night.  This wasn't aimed at you, it was aimed at him and it worked. So why is your husband not furious with her as well?"
10,"I 100% second this, but I wouldn't underestimate how far this could take her in court. Judges are heavily discouraged from using someone's previous abuse experiences (or even previously made false accusations, for that matter) when approached with fresh cases. "
11,"He's cheating on you. 

Stop having sex without condoms. If you don't want to get STDs....it's really easy not to..USE CONDOMS. If someone won't fuck you unless you don't require one....don't fuck them. Simple. Easy. 

And for fucks sake, please use birth control. The amount of idiotic behavior in this post is bigly. "
12,"Fuck yes to all of this. 

OP, you sound utterly self-absorbed. I hope you wake up one day and realize just how immature and cruel you've acted. "
13,"It honestly seems like more people will be miserable if your grandmother comes to the wedding. If 85% of your family doesn't like or want to be around her, you're taking a huge risk of them not showing up. Not to mention having to have people babysit/police her to keep her in line. That doesn't sound fun at all.

I might be coming off as its a numbers game, but I would heavily weigh the pros and cons of this situation. Grandma thats mostly nice to me and more than half the family can't stand and might not come because of her, or having more than half the family attend my wedding."
14,"First, you don't just end up cheating on someone. It's a decision you make. But it doesn't have to be. 

Stop watching porn and masturbating so much. You're just desensitizing your mind and your penis to sex with an actual woman​. 

You said this started after she gave birth but didn't mention how long ago that was. I can guarantee you though that she doesn't feel sexy. Depending​ on how recently she gave birth, she may not even be able to have sex! Spend the time you save from not watching porn constantly making sure she feels appreciated and help with the damn baby. "
15,Come forward about it. Your parents deserve closure too. 
16,"Why not? As long as you're in shape, it's no big deal."
17,This.  OP is giving away 20 minutes of her life 2x day so the mooch can save 20 minutes of his.  Why would she continue to do this?  Is his time and life more valuable than hers?  Add in the extra gas money and she's losing out big time.
18,"Also me with regular cheetos. I specifically told my SO ""No, buy me the smaller personal bag of cheetos or else I WILL eat the entire bag in one sitting"". He didn't believe me and bought me the bigger bag anyways. 

Guess who ate it all? I seriously can't control myself around that stuff."
19,"&gt; My wife truly, madly deeply loves and adores me, I know this for a fact

But obviously not enough to stop texting another man and to be honest with you.

It sounds like she is at least **emotionally cheating** with this other man. 

Would you consider couples therapy?"
20,The biting and lack of boundaries definitely overshadows everything else. The fact that he called her out in front of people and she STILL doubled down on her perceptions is kinda scary.
21,You need new friends.... fuck these people. 
22,"Ah, you're *that* vegan. If you expect people to respect your religion and dietary restrictions, you'll have to show the same respect back to them."
23,"How far are you from becoming financially solvent? By solvent I mean: the debt is cleared, you're able to save for expenditures and retirement, you're paying your rent and other bills on time, you have a reliable source of income. If paying rent has been an issue over the last year and you're still not sure if you'll have a job come summer (it's *April* dude) I can see why she'd get frustrated with this. You've been together for 7 years. How are you guys supposed to plan any kind of future together, much less small fun things like trips, when you can't hold your head above water?"

27,I would advise against being a car dealer and line cook working his way up to chef in LA. It's extremely expensive and the three of you won't have a good quality of life. 
28,Except for some people don't use online banking. I personally know someone worth millions of dollars(and probably know more than just one. But this particular one O know for fact) that wont order things online and could not be forced at gunpoint to do banking online. He goes to the bank and deposits/withdraws cash as he needs it. He does use debit cards and he does use credit cards. And his accountant most likely pays his credit card bills online. But if he makes any sort of transaction...he does it by physically going to the bank and getting money. Or writes a check. That doesn't make him foolish. And he would be the last person on earth that is irresponsible with money. And my parents don't bank online either. They aren't bad with money. And up until two years ago my mom wouldn't pay a single bill online because she was convinced it was simple for someone to just go into her computer and steal her identity. Just because someone doesn't do all of their banking online and doesn't know the password/pin for banking online doesn't make them bad with money. I think you may be confusing online banking with a pin for a debit card or something. I don't bank online either. I can't really speak for much else. Because I am in fact bad with money. But its pretty unfair to consider everyone who doesn't do all their banking online foolish.

31,"This is nuts man. I'm bi-polar I do as much as possible, including therapy and meds. I would never, ever keep a gun in my house. You can do everything everything perfectly and still have some crazy, manic moments that are irrational. Why would a gun be important to anyone enough to even have this argument with someone? I've thought about knives or jumping in front of a car and only the most likely failure was what stopped me. If there was a gun, I doubt I would be as afraid of failing. Fuck off with this, man. "
32,Send some really beautiful flowers because mom and grandma will really appreciate that gesture . It's okay. They said it's okay.
33,"&gt;I asked if we weren't together and she wasn't married if he would be interested, without hesitation he said ""Yes.""

Wow. Yep, this thing is dead in the water.

Better late than never OP! You're still young and you've got your whole life ahead of you and so many opportunities for true happiness are in your future, I assure you."
34,Side note OP. Do not ever buy property with someone without the benefits of marriage. Imagine if you had tied yourself to this guy in that way prior to discovering how awful he really is? Don't even consider it again.

36,"&gt; She bought it two years before we met, and i told her that i chose for her and not for the farm.

How much progress was made between the time she bought it and the time you came along?"
37,"So sorry you're having to deal with this. Your mom sounds a lot like my step daughter's mom. She's still waiting on Christmas/Birthday presents that we're ""in the mail"". Her birthday was in January. :( 

I know it really hurts when your parents let you down. It eats away at you and its causing more stress and anxiety than you need. I'm sure you have enough on your plate with the rest of the wedding details. 

My best advice is to let it go. She probably won't come through and you don't want that to be a dark cloud over your big day. If she comes through, awesome. If not, you've got it covered. "
38,"A lot of comments ate getting sidetracked by the fact that you treated yourself to something nice. Please don't let that get to you! Harmless indulgences like a pair of sunglasses that make you feel great are a perfect way to spend discretionary money. It's not like you broke the bank or bought yourself something dangerous or unreasonable  (""help! My boyfriend just ruined my new bag of cocaine!""). 

While he absolutely should repay you, I'm not at all certain that he will. I would suggest sitting down with him and having a serious talk when neither if you is feeling emotional, and see how he really feels. If his stance is unchanged, I hope you'll seriously evaluate staying in a relationship with someone who is careless and demeans you and treats you callously. This also may be a reason why he's dating someone six years younger than he is during a time of life when people change and grow dramatically. Maybe no woman of his age (who is presumably more confident and aware of her own value and boundaries) would have him."
39,"Is this a situation you actually want? To be hidden from everyone? For how long? A year? 3 years? It's likely that she'll realize she doesn't want to do this anymore and just stop seeing you? Do you want her to not be able to do anything with you whenever her family suggests something because she wouldn't know how to say no to them?


As a general rule, I'm of the opinion  (and both sides seem to be constantly on this subreddit), that the specific day of a birthday is not super important. I wouldn't want my SO to give up a fun opportunity with other people just because it's my birthday, when we could just as easily celebrate the day before or after. In future relationships,  even in a healthy relationship, there will be stuff going on on the 4th of July, that you will have to make decisions about together. If you play the ""it's my birthday"" card, it will lead to resentment."
40,"My bestie and I have been asked if we were a lesbian couple before, she had also just feed me some of her dinner from her own plate but #yolo. Sorry not sorry that I'm close with my best friend. We don't care either. We're not gay and if we were it wouldn't matter anyway. "

&gt;But... holy fuck, if that's in mph, then that's going 145 km/h when the posted limit is 100 km/h (I'm Canadian). If I found out my wife got a ticket for that, I'd be absolutely livid that she 1) put herself in that kind of danger and 2) put everyone else on the road in that kind of danger (and in that order of importance). 

I'm not defending this, and people have different tolerances for reckless driving, but I'll point out that every time I drive on California Highways in rural areas, people in the fast lane are going at minimum 80. They only drive 65 if there's a cop right there, otherwise they'll be tailgated within seconds.  90 is not unusual for some roads. That doesn't mean it's a good idea.


&gt;A big issue issue is that you've been together for two years, and he's done this multiple times, but you've never stood up for yourself

Sounds like she's tried and he shouts her down and doesn't listen. This isn't just being a doormat, or not communicating. This is an unhealthy relationship.

59,"&gt;he doesnt want to move out of his parents house. He says he saves money on rent so why would he move out (he wants to live with his family until he buys and pays off most of the mortgage on a house). Instead he wanted me to move in to his parents house.

Um yeah this is a big NOPE.

He doesn't want to move out because he has a sweet deal and can continue to be taken care of by mommy and daddy. How nice for him. But you realize that means you are not dealing with an adult, right? He has no idea how to live on his own, pay bills, prioritize, budget, sacrifice short term goals for long term ones. So that's strike one.

Strike two is him expecting you to be perfectly ok with signing onto this deal. Because he wants  you to. Because starting a life together as two ADULTS is apparently too difficult for him. 

&gt;he laughed sarcastically and said ""funny you dont have an issue with financially burdening me""

Strike 3. Literally belittling you and mocking you. What is he ""saving money"" for if not to start his life with a partner? An equal partner who is willing to share the financial burden, which it sounds like you are?

This guy is a child. A douchey one at that. You want an adult relationship. You are incompatible. You should run far and fast from this."

It sounds like you won't.  Your unwillingness to support her will show her that you're in it for her family's money, not for love and building a future together."

There is no real answer to your question. Some relationships will find a healthy balance and mutual appreciation and some won't. Neither is right or wrong.

They are explicitly all stating that they are okay with what they've done. 

If you show up you will also be condoning it. You not being there isn't going to be the end of the world or destroy the family, it's *already been destroyed when they took the side of a guy who cheated you all out of money and on his wife.* How about your dad and grandpa swallow their pride for once? Why do you have to bend to the whims of someone, while minimizing your values and morals, because they would rather have a good time than treat people with dignity and respect (your brother's wife for one!). 

Just write off your family for now. You know where they stand on this issue, you know where you stand, and neither is compatible. "

Break up and tell him you won't speak to him again and then you have to follow through. 

Because if you let him goad you into texting or calling back, then he knows exactly what he has to do to get your attention again.

92,"She's entitled to feel that way, but you absolutely do not have to let her sleep with other people. If she felt like she needed to fuck other men, would you let her? Why is it different because they're women? There is a huge difference between controlling your partner and setting boundaries regarding what is and is not acceptable in your relationship. To the vast majority of people, sitting around while their partner fucks other people is not acceptable.

Considering this is now affecting your sex life, it's likely your girlfriend is simply using you as a hold-over until she finds a woman she's comfortable with. Ever see the sitcom Friends where Ross' wife turns out to be a lesbian and leaves him? You're Ross. You can choose to let her do this, but with how everything sounds, know you're in a very one-sided arrangement that will likely not work out for you in the end. Alternatively, you can put your foot down (which you have every right to do) and make this a firm limit, and if she needs to sleep with women, she can leave.

Never tolerate something simply because you're afraid to lose someone."

I have stuck it out with different friends.

[My mum was the primary carer for my grandmother.  From time to time I would take a week off work and stay with my gran and my mum would go away on holiday.  It really did her the world of good to get a break from everything.  I'm reading your mum's comments as though she wants the break but can't quite say that she wants to go away by herself...]"

109,"Bullshit. The US does not have nicer people than Australia. The lifestyle isn't less stressful either. It's like, the opposite of ""less stressful"" especially with the added tension right now.  

Also wtf. Alabama? West Virginia? Florida? And he talks about better LGBT rights/acceptance (and nicer people) being a motivator.. yeah right. His reasons sound ""liberal"", but then he says he likes how the US is POLITICALLY? Now he's just trolling. I say you get deeper into this and don't entertain his thoughts of moving until you figure out his real agenda.   "
110,"I'm not sure if he's graduating, I think he didn't earn enough credits and may have to come back next year. In theory he is supposed to though so I don't know.

I have told him, but it's starting to wear on me. I know in the end he'll make himself look crazy but I honestly don't want to deal with it at all. If he spreads lies about me, people will believe him as he's more well-known than me "
111,"She needs to be reported because she should not be around special needs adults with that attitude.  After doing that, explain to your class next time how nobody is perfect and what she did was wrong, and that some people like to judge others because they don't like what they like. "

113,"&gt;But I'm afraid in a few years down the line, it's just going to be me supporting her and her being a stay-at-home wife or something.

I had a small business and he just didn't care. First sale, 500th sale, recognition on a big website leading to my highest grossing day... All he would say is 'congrats' and not celebrate or anything. When I got my Associates, then Bachelors, ""congrats""... I am always there for him and he apologizes for hurting me, says things will change, that I am the only one for him and things will be better, but nothing ever is."

125,"Yeah it is man, sorry. Huge amount of difference between 28-18 in terms of life experience, what you might want from life, maturity, etc. An 18 year old is still basically a kid, she likely has a lot left to do before she settles down and she's not the girl you want to look for when you're saying things like wanting to start a family by 35. This isn't her. You're also dealing with a fair amount of insecurity and the such, and it's not really right to get an 18 year old wrapped up in that. You should be shooting for a few years older."

on the contrary, it will clarify the situation, and how low you are in his priorities. It will make you wake up and realise you married an asshole. Who is (a) childish, (b) doesnt care what you feel, and (c) doesnt care about your health.

"
138,"Honestly, this reads like you are looking for permission to not change because it might not be perfect. 

First of all, I get that you are devastated. This was a huge shock and you need time to process. And you should take that time. 

But after you get a little distance, and a little perspective, I think you'll see that you have two choices: 1. Learning to love your body as is, leave your husband, and find a partner who is attracted to you or 2. Try losing 80 pounds and see if that makes a difference in how you or he view the situation. 

If you love how you look, then rock on! You are 29 and have plenty of time to start over and find someone who finds you to be sexy. However, I don't get the sense that you are actually happy with your size. Do you feel confident and sexy, or did you before he said anything? Your post makes it seem like he finally confirmed the thoughts you think about yourself. So are you hurt by him? Or hurt by the reality of your own thoughts? Do you want to lose weight to keep him or make yourself better?

As someone in the middle of a 60 lb weight loss effort after pregnancy (I have the skin, the flab and the stretch marks), I get that it's daunting. And yeah, you probably won't have the body of a 20 year old who hasn't had kids when it's all said and done. But Google pictures of moms who have some flabby skin due to pregnancy but are otherwise toned and ask yourself if that really seems like a position that would would make you feel worse than you do now. 

You don't have to make any decisions right now. But that status quo doesn't seem to be working for you, so consider what your options are and what path is most likely to lead to happiness. "
139,Did you ever get that Valentine's day present?
140,This is the real question.  If he set up some kind of trust for OP then OP needs to talk to a lawyer.  If it wasn't in the will then its just from grandma out of the goodness of her heart and she can set whatever conditions she wants.
141,"If those were her expectations, she should have expressed them prior to her birthday. Not months later, in reaction to a gift he bought for his *sister*. And especially not after she accepted and apparently enjoyed the gift which she asked for. 

That's what is *killing me* in this post; people are characterizing a multi-part asked-for gift from MONTHS ago as ""incredibly thoughtless"". This would be ""incredibly thoughtless"" for a ten-year anniversary, or a first Mother's Day. *Maybe*. What he describes is a thoughtful and sweet gift for a short term girlfriend, which was gladly received until she decided that a 17-year-old is her competition. 

If she had come to him like, ""that gift you got your sister was really sweet, can you make more effort like that for our anniversary? I loved the gifts for my birthday but I would love something personal and special,"" sure, then I would be on her side. But a 27-year-old woman who throws a tantrum over birthday presents would be an automatic dealbreaker in my book. "
142,"It's pretty much just inappropriate and awful regardless. Unless op believes his life or safety is at risk (or emotional abuse obviously), ghosting is just a dick move, especially after 2 YEARS. Maybe after a couple months but even then, grow a pair (ovaries or tentacles, dealers choice) and have the difficult conversation, damn.

Edit: saw testicles autocorrected to tentacles. I'm leaving it."
143,"I think you're being transitioned to ""work wife"" (look it up - not sexual in nature, but taking over a lot of nuturing roles in the workplace).  It sounds like his wife helped him out before but she now probably prefers to stay at home with the kid, which leaves you in a weird position of companion/intern."
144,This is true. Despite being bound together by children (who are now adults) OP isn't her family anymore. She made that choice when she decided to cheat on him.

146,"Nope SORRY. She was 27/28. That is not ""young"" as you put it. Young would have been 20-24. She was a grown ass woman and she completely abandoned her kids because she was a ***useless*** sack of shit. I am 28 and I would ***never*** in a million years do that to my boys. EVER: "
147,"Summer is like three or four months long. When is her new date scheduled? Did you ask her why she changed her date? There's really not enough information here to give you accurate advice. 

I would speak with her. If you don't already know, ask her why she moved her wedding date up. If she's really only been with him for 7 months, you could try encouraging her to wait until the following summer to get married to him. If you do decide to go this route, make sure you don't mention your wedding at all. Keep the focus on her behavioral changes and the short length of time they've been together. "
148,"I would say there are two choices. 

* dump her for being too fucking stupid to understand this concept. 

* dump her for understanding it and thinking you are dumb enough to accept that bullshit excuse.

150,"You don't have to do anything that you're not comfortable doing, even if you already told him that you could.  Consent can be revoked at any time.  Would he be willing to show you any porn that acts out his fantasy?  You're not acting out the actual government and the role play doesn't validate any of the things that have happened in history.  He may have compared it to a Nazi fetish because they have a recognizable uniform and the power is of a corruptive nature.

Have you seen Archer?  I think their KGB is hilarious, and viewing the role play from that angle could help you feel more comfortable.  Sexy government agent catches a defector, punishes him in a naughty way."
151,"You know, I've often seen the argument that as long as incestual relationships are consensual there is nothing ""wrong"" with them, but I still find it absolutely repulsive and I can't honestly say I'd be able to have any kind of involvement with someone who could fuck their sibling. It's not like they were tiny kids who didn't know any better either.

Realistically, do you trust him to be around his sister knowing this? Are you going to be able to go to family gatherings without feeling queasy? Are you going to be able to have a life with this guy and see his sister around knowing they had sex? Yes, it's ok for this to be a dealbreaker. Anything *can* be a dealbreaker. If this is (understandably) something that is just too weird to ever move past, then tell him so.

I personally would not tell the husband, because in all honesty it's so crazy to think about I doubt he'd believe it/"
152,"I speak as someone who had this happen to her. I was extremely angry and upset because we'd talked this out before we started farming for the mount. I made sure he was okay that, if it dropped, I could have it and we'd continue farming until he got it, too. Lucky day, a few months later, it dropped. I rolled and then after a few moments, it showed that he rolled, too, and won. He had this grin on his face for a while and immediately used the item. A few moments later, he apologized and said he honestly didn't think we'd ever get it and that he really wanted it, that I could obviously have it next time. I logged out of the game immediately and wouldn't talk to him all night, despite him trying. Took me a full day before I'd talk to him. 

When we finally did talk, I was calm enough to explain that he'd promised me he wasn't going to roll on it and that we'd spoken quite a few times about it, so it felt like a betrayal. It wasn't even about the mount, at that point, but about his promise and about how our communicating, my feelings, meant nothing. We moved on, eventually, but it did stay with me long enough that I still remember it, though we've been broken up for a while. His same attitude with the mount was elsewhere in our relationship and it blew up, eventually. With her, I'm sure it's the same. It's not the mount, it's everything surrounding it. Someone else said it better than I, so listen to MsConfused9. "

155,"I love gaming, but there is no way I could have a screen on in my bedroom if I was trying to sleep. No way. It sounds like there are other issues here, but space is a major one. Figure out how to game in the bathroom or closet, or get a 1 bedroom. It's not just the sound, it's the light. "
156,"This isn't a conversation to have via text, for one.

It sounds like she has a busy full life that you're one part of. Nothing wrong with that. Fill up your own life, make concrete plans to do things with her (rather than just BE THERE to hang out.) Don't be needy and don't contradict yourself (please pick me over them but I'm not asking you to pick me over them.) She's working, she's in school, she's committed to her family, and has friends, and a boyfriend - that's a lot to juggle and there's only so many hours in a week. You're not her husband and she's very young. Respect her life."
157,"Just a tip. I knew a girl who was able to snoop her ex-boyfriend's e-mail by using the security questions to reset his password. 

Don't forget to change those to something she doesn't know about you or just change the answer to some weird fake answer instead of a fact that she could possibly know. "

Maybe I'm cynical and have been reading AskAManager too much though..."
159,"You know what you have done, and you know that you tried all you could to get him help.  You can't help someone who won't help himself.

Good luck!"
162,"The only thing that confuses me is that you said you had a baby that is 6 years old but you only graduated college 3 years ago.  

Other then that fuck both of them.  I'd also take a paternity test if you think that baby isn't yours.  Sounds like she's been using you and since high school if she's no good that child is not your problem.  

However the baby would be an innocent by standard in this.  However if you can prove the child is not yours then you can stop with the child support payments at least and quietly move on."

I wouldn't count the weed as that was a gift from you to them. For example, if you give someone a pricey gift, but they are living on minimum-wage, then it's hardly fair to expect them to ""pay the price of the gift in beers and such"". BUT if you want to show them their place a bit, then you can add ""don't worry about the weed, that was a gift""


If you have any reason to believe they are tight on cash, then I'd just send the money.

170,"Man, this almost exactly happened to me. My best friend and I (both female) knew each other for two years when I told her that I loved her. We are both bisexual and she was also dating someone at the time.

Long story short, things didn't work out and we had a huge falling out. We didn't talk for about a year, but we got in touch about a year and a half ago.

Now we're great friends again and she just came to visit a few months ago to do a road trip around California. We are both happy and with other people. No weird tension between us.

So all I want to say is that although it hurts a lot right now and it seems like you've lost her forever... Things will change. You need to give her time to get over you. My best friend let me have time and reach out when I was ready. It was hard for both of us.

We both realized that although we love each other, that doesn't mean we need to be together. There is not a clear divide between the overwhelming love of an amazing friendship and that of a great romance.

Hopefully she'll realize this one day and you guys will be back in each other's lives before too long.

Best of luck"

If you are a contributing member of the household (both in chores and finances) able to operate autonomously, it can just be a different flavor of roommate arrangement.

173,"Most of the times that I've seen the ""break up"" or ""cut out"" response is when people are in, what sounds like, legitimately abusive relationships.

I think people in general are way to nice about people being assholes and we need to remind people you can leave your husband, cut out your family and end friendships if you feel like you have to. It's okay to do that. If you don't get anything back from a relationship it's not something you need in your life. Relationships are two way streets and a lot of people get stuck just giving and never getting. You don't have to accept that and I think it's good to remind people of that.

I've seen the ""this sub always tell people to break up"" way more times then I've seen a break up suggested."

180,"She should be contacting a women's shelter. 

Maybe I'm totally off, but there is a chance that this is a big ruse to get you back. It all seems a bit coincidental. The part about breaking up with an abusive asshole may be true, but after leaving abusive partners, a victim frequently ends up with a big gaping hole where their soul used to be. It would not be weird at all if she looked back at her time with you and wished she could go back to that time. 

So, yeah, the proper place for her is a women's shelter where she can receive counseling and services to help her get back on her feet, not in your living room trolling up your current relationship. "

I'd refuse t speak to her until I got an apology for 1)coming in your house uninvited with a key that was given for a specific purpose 2) telling your entire family about your sex life (!!!!) and 3) acting like you're an incompetent child who needs her permission to live her life. 
189,"THANK YOU, I can't imagine how dehumanizing it must be for OP."
190,"&gt; And she STILL doesn’t have a job! She filed for disability some time ago and actually got approved.

Let's take these two things as related.  While disability fraud exists, getting on disability without any visible illness or injury is not easy.  Start from the assumption that your sister is legitimately disabled (perhaps with some sort of mental illness) and this is why she doesn't have a job.  

&gt; My parents can’t take any more loans, so now they want me to take one to cover Monica’s ever growing debt.

Assuming you are in the US this is a horrible financial idea.  If your sister files for bankruptcy, her SSI &amp; SSDI payments are protected.  Neither your income nor your parents is protected in the same way.  Co-signing on loans that end up part of a bankruptcy proceeding will cause a huge mess.  Taking out a loan in your name only to pay off her debts is also a huge problem!  Any money you give her from that loan to pay off existing debts will be considered a gift.  The amount of monetary gifts she can be given while still retaining her disability is limited.  

&gt; How can I even trust that Monica will take some responsibility this time?

The most charitable interpretation of this situation you can have is that her disability impairs her ability to do so.  The least is that she has no interest in doing so.  Either means that you can not expect her behavior to change substantially.

&gt; The only reason I would help her is for the sake of my niece, because I don’t want her to suffer for her mom’s poor spending habits.

Unless you intend to provide funds to your sister for her entire life, there's no way you can do this.  

&gt; Thoughts?

If you want to help your family, the most you should do is pay for your parents to meet with a professional who has experience with financial planning for parents who have disabled adult children.  They can talk to your parents about what they can and can not do for your sister without risking your sister's disability payments,  how disability trusts work, how their current plan only delays bankruptcy rather than stoping it, what the consequences of co-signed loans will be when your sister inevitably hits bankruptcy, and so on.  

If you want to insulate your niece from this, work on teaching her financial responsibility, set up a college fund, save up to pay for school related ""fun stuff"" her parents may not be able to afford, and ensure that any gifts you give can't be sold to pay for whatever it is your sister wants this week (this can most easily be done by paying for experiences rather than things).

You're also well within your rights to just tell your parents no.

&gt; I don’t know whether to help her.

Don't help her by giving her money.  In the long run that won't provide much in the way of help.  She'll end up bankrupt regardless.  If you want to help, focus on helping your parents not get pulled down with her."

192,"I do it for a living so I can't relate. But it's important to do that because it gives you a chance to: 1. Check for bedbugs before getting settled in the room. And 2. See how high that hotel's cleanliness standard is. 


I know how hard the work is, so I'm sympathetic to staff. But I still have standards. There's honestly no excuse for poor cleanliness in a hotel. I can excuse outdated appliances or damaged wallpaper, replacing those things is a pain in the ass and not always an option. But there's no reason a room should be dirty, that's literally the *only* thing that can be controlled on a daily basis. 

Poor cleanliness is a sign of mismanagement and employees getting away with cutting corners. That's the last thing I want in my staff. It takes a lot of extra work, but hotels live and die by how clean they're kept. "

196,"**The amount of ""It's hormones! You did nothing wrong!"" comments aren't helpful. They write off your wife's feelings and don't help you understand her.**

Even if hormones are a part of your wife's reaction, it's likely she's been feeling neglected for a long time-- especially if she begged you to do something with her after a long shift. This was just the straw that broke the camel's back. 

She likely knew you were exhausted. She's probably a bit desperate to spend time with you, and is scared that you're not emotionally invested in your kid since you're not around for her to get a sense of it.

You might look into Love Languages. What one person perceives as signs of love-- like kind words, or giving gifts-- might not be perceived the same way by a partner (who might value acts of service or physical affection instead).

Also, **you're having a kid.** This is going to be a time of major adjustment, both in your relationship, and in your individual lives. Your wife may suddenly have different expectations of you. Have you taken time to communicate about your expectations of each other for when the baby arrives? If not, get going. It's easier to sort these things out calmly beforehand than in the heat of a moment when baby is shrieking, your wife is in tears, and you're wishing you were back on duty.

Effectively navigating conflict is the key to a long-lasting relationship, not never having any fights. Fights are normal. It's how you come back from them that matters.

My husband and I are going on 7 years together (2 married) and we're *just now* getting a handle on conflict management. It's not easy. But it's worth all the effort you can make if you really want to be together."

I'd let him know you're feeling sensitive and talk to him about the comment outside of an argument (when you're both feeling level-headed). 

 "
207,"Jesus fucking Christ this sub. OP, it sounds like a simple miscommunication. It sounds like your bf assumed you knew he was only teasing you, and that you never told him his comments made you feel humiliated. 

Some of this users suggesting he's a horrible asshole that wants you to be a less confident, dependent person are just insane! He recognized the change in you and asked what had happened, and said he didn't mean to make you feel bad.

Neither of you did something terribly wrong. I applaud you for taking initiative to become more independent, however, since you have trouble reading social cues, you might find it helpful to communicate your feelings to people. Most people, if you say, ""it hurts when you say that/make those comments."" Would respond by apologizing, and not doing it again. And then nobody needs to feel bad after that. 

Now as for what to do, well, it's up to you. If you like being independent, then you don't have to go back to relying on him for things. You tell him that he does offer things to the relationship, for instance, helping you grow, and go about your merry days. 

If you like relying on him for things like bug killing and jar opening (jars are my arch rival!) then go back to relying on him for those things. 

Or, find a happy medium.

Maybe you can publish part of the project yourself or still get credit if they bring a 4th post-grad to finish it up.

At this point nobody can tell you what options are available because they don't know the situation.  If your supervisor is unhelpful, go to your department head or dean or another female professor.  There may be other projects that you can research, they may have counseling options.

You don't owe the US professor anything because he helped you with grant money and lab assistance and mentorship - that was his job.

When you talk to your faculty members, just remember that everything is negotiable.  Even if you don't want to go further, don't let them decline you credit for what you have already accomplished, and don't let them push you into contact with this guy.  Get the agreement to credit in writing.  You aren't prosecuting or trying to punish the guy, you are trying to distance yourself so they should hopefully work with you.

239,"&gt; He wants kids and likes traditional gender roles / to be taken care of. I don't want kids / can't be the perfect woman.

Stop. Stop this shit right now. Being a 'traditional' woman who cooks and cleans and stays home with the kids does **not** make someone a 'perfect woman', and not doing those things doesn't make someone an imperfect one. Get that nonsense out of your head right now.


Why is that nonsense in your head in the first place? Because

&gt; He had past controlling issues but it's gotten better or it's more subtle now.

It hasn't gotten better, and it's not at all subtle. Your partner is now just abusing you in a different way. You're not enough of a woman, not a good woman, unless you're a doting wife and mother. He just changed up his script, and it had exactly the effect he intended because you're all confused and unsure of yourself now, and thinking 'was it/is it still that bad?'


&gt; I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm confused. 

You have been dating this controlling guy through the most formative years of your young adulthood. This is all you've been 'trained' to know. You haven't experienced a healthy adult relationship. There is a reason so many controlling and abusive people seek out those much younger than themselves. It's textbook. To top it off, abusers are *really fucking good* at confusing and convincing partners who are thinking about leaving. People with years of healthy dating experience are bamboozled by these assholes, because they're good at what they do. This guy has had 30 years of learning how to manipulate people, he's a pro.

Also, controlling asshats have really great radar for people who lean toward being co dependent. People who are too anxious or afraid or insecure to believe that they can do it in their own, and so they'll put up with this crap because it's better than nothing.

TL;DR: Run girl. Run like your tampon string is on fire.

That's good. Make sure what you say falls within his person boundaries. Check in with him. Make sure he's always comfortable. This is a part of a healthy relationship.

&gt;Boundaries for what? Sharing intimate details? Maybe you're 50 and don't do it, but I'm 20 and every friend I've had at one point or another likes to talk their sex life with me.

Boundaries for everything. You accuse me of being condescending by not sugar coating what I am telling you, and then you purposefully act childish? That is hugely confusing and hypocritical of you. Perhaps your friends aren't the most mature people if they want to blare their sex life everywhere? 

&gt;Not a pact. My mistake on saying it was, but it was not and never a pact between us.

Your explanation makes it a pact. You held each other to it. It's time to stop giving up so much weight and let it go completely, including living up to someone else's expectations and reactions to how you live your life. 

&gt;I made my choice. I had sex even though I know she wouldn't want that for me because ultimately, my choice. Obviously I care about her emotions too.

You should not care what someone else thinks of your sex life. That is completely personal. It's time for you to make it a personal thing you share with someone without letting other people be involved in any way. 

That's been my advice all along, you are just too busy pretending that I am attacking you to listen it to.

244,"I'm around your age, with many, many single friends and I have never heard of a man insisting this is normal. This is not normal. "

Real friendship cannot be forced, and people can tell if you want to be their friend personally or just their 'friend' to rack up friends. I have come across many people like this before, there is nothing that they say that is amiss, not even anything they were doing, but they gave off desperation vibes and 'I need insta-friends' vibes. It is hard to explain but I know it when I see/feel it and it creeps me out and makes me not like them.

Take the pressure off of yourself and stop interacting with people with the aim of making them your friend, but merely as getting to know them. It takes time to make friends and to be a friend. 

&gt;  I never get the feeling that people hate me or avoid me, but I never feel that they want to take things any further

Further in what way, what does this mean to you? As someone who takes a long time to make friends, this really jumped out at me as concerning. It could be people want to take things further and develop friendship with you but you demand it too soon. Try just being friendly and acquaintances with people for a while, without trying to 'take it further'."

Was the woman elderly/pregnant/disabled? Was the guy? 

Looking at it from another perspective were you nice to your gf? You and she planned to spend the day together at a concert she really wanted to go to. You tried to force her to give up her seat and stand so that an able-bodied man could have her seat; you held made her wait while you held the door for everyone; you missed getting tickets because you weren't willing to assert yourself to stop holding the door; then you got upset with her that she saw the concert that she came to the city to see.

It sounds like you have no sense of adventure. Most of your hobbies are solo and/or done in the safety of your home. Even the TV and books you watch/read are very factual/rooted in reality and leaves hardly any room for the imagination.

Guys don't want to know you have have all of the same interests, but knowing you will be disinterested with theirs and that your interests won't bring something ""fun"" to the table either would definitely push a lot of guys away.

If we were talking or went on a date I would describe your interests to my friends as ""old lady hobbies"". 

That doesn't mean you are forever alone though. I'm sure there are guys who are looking for someone like you. There has to be guys out there that dont like to party and keep a tame life, but they might be harder to find.

If you feel like maybe you aren't getting as much as you want out of life, then maybe you should switch things up, but it shouldn't be just to make potential dates happy.

Things like traveling, concerts, museums, and taking some pottery/painting/whatever classes might be up your alley without you feeling uncomfortable or losing yourself.

Another thing I would do when talking to people is just bring up your stories that seem the most exciting and talking about stuff that you've always wanted to do/try. Most people are ""tame"" day to day, but once in a while they do something that's out of their ordinary and that's what makes them seem interesting. "

276,"There's no real way to avoid drama here, because there's some guilt on both sides.

Hear me out: yes, your aunt majorly oversteps the boundaries you have set, and she does this repeatedly. But you also haven't enforced any consequences when she crosses these lines. You took the bowl of mac and cheese away, and when she gave it back to him, you stood there and argued with her. You didn't remove the bowl again. You didn't remove the dog from the situation. Your words said ""no"" but your actions said ""I'll roll over if you argue with me,"" which she likely took as permission to continue this pattern. So in my eyes she's guilty of overstepping boundaries, and you're guilty of enabling her to do so.

If you want free dog care and you want your aunt to provide it, you're going to continue having this issue and your dog will eat whatever she gives it. Your dog is also a puppy. This is his learning stage, and she's teaching him that people food is for puppies, whatever it may be. Of course he's going to be grumpy when you don't give him any. He's learned he's *supposed* to get some and doesn't understand why you withhold it.

If you want dog care during the day that follows the rules you set, you need to pay for it. You can hire someone to come once a day to let him out or feed him lunch. There are also doggy daycare centers you can take your dog to, and you pick him up on the way back from work. These people are professionals, they know how to handle dogs, and they don't feed people food to their four-legged customers.

TLDR; your aunt oversteps boundaries, but you don't show her any consequences. If you want her to stop, she needs to stop dogsitting. Pay for a daycare center or a different dogsitter."

It's true that your mother did a lot for you growing up, but that's what mothers do. Any self-respecting parent is going to try to pay for their child's college if they are financially able. Any parent is going to want to help pay for their child's wedding. Those are social norms, not exceptions. What is an exception is a parent attaching strings to those gifts and using those strings to move you around long after you are supposed to be an adult and living your own best life. A good parent wants their children to have a better life than they did, sets them up as best as they can to do so, and then experiences joy when their child is happy and successful. It sounds like your mother has lost track of wishing for your happiness and is entirely focused on your brother. Maybe she assumes that because you don't have a 70 IQ you'll be fine, but that isn't fair or reasonable to you. If you choose to do anything for your brother in the future, it must be something that you want and choose independently of your mother, and on your terms.

Go to the UK and enjoy your life! Elite colleges are phenomenal places--I don't know if you're an Ivy Leaguer as well, but prepare for a great few years. When your mom bothers you, have a set line: ""Husband and I have decided to leave for the UK. That is a final decision and I would like you to respect it. If you want to discuss logistics I am happy to have that conversation, but if you even imply that I shouldn't go, the conversation is over."" Obviously don't say exactly that, but take the gist. Prepare for a little bit of no-contact if your mother can't stomach your choices right now, because she's honestly being terrible and manipulative. I'll take your word that that isn't normal for her, and provided that's the case, your relationship should come back once she cools down."
278,"This is 100% correct. I would also add that she is so insistent on her vision of the future, because she doesn't see a better course of action. After she and her husband pass, either bro moves to sis in a different country or he gets a new guardian. I don't think either of those options will be a good end result for the brother."
279,Let's be clear: This is not your fault. Your wife should not have cheated.
280,"At what point have you asked *yourself* if you want a divorce? Are *you* ok?

This shouldn't be about what your wife wants, nor should it be about the Christian counselor's desire to fix your marriage (side note: already asking you to forgive? WTF). Your feelings are important here and it doesn't sound like you've taken the time and space to even figure them out."
281,"OP is not just ""in the picture""-- she didn't make it a big part of her post but, she said that she was also accepted into a PhD program at the same prestigious university, so she absolutely has a big accomplishment to celebrate as well. "
282,"You have a wife, and she's married. And you're extended family.

283,"&gt; My job field is definitely ""deals are made on the back 9"" kind of a thing

&gt; It's not in my job title

Yeah, those don't agree. Under this type of boss, it apparently is part of her job.

"
284,"She's the one making it awkward though. If she didn't go through your things she'd be none the wiser. Instead she violated your privacy and now she's punishing you for her own stupidity, basically.

*You* did nothing wrong. *You* are an adult. Pretend like nothing, go about your day as usual, and if she thaws then good. If she brings it up a simple, ""We're not going to talk about this because it's none of your business"" to shut her down, and leave the room if she persists.

To give her the benefit of the doubt, it might also be that her conservative mind is absolutely boggled and horrified by the very real meeting with one of your sexual preferences. It's equally weird for a parent to come face to face with their children's sexuality as it is for the children to come face to face with their parents'. It doesn't make her behaviour okay, but it might explain it."
285,Your response is spot on and your username is amazing. *slow clap*
286,"you are past couples therapy, honey. way past."
287,You're fighting real hard to spend one on one time with someone you claim to not have feelings for. 
288,"Me at 23:  ""Not into kids.""
Me at 46:  ""Still not into kids.""

Never count on someone changing."
289,"Well I don't see the harm in going to a theater, a drink, or a concert alone or with a known male friend-but it sounds like you need to have a come to Jesus talk with her about boundaries. Establish boundaries, if she slips up again, either talk it out or dump her. Tbh MANY young women think this way-we think, if we go out with a guy who has not 1. Explicably stated we are on a ""date,"" and/or 2. That we are not even remotely attracted too, that we're just ""hanging out with a friend."" Of course age and maturity changes that view over time. Have another talk, if she gets it, cool. If not, move on."
290,ty OP for dealing out some sass. She deserves far sassier but I'm glad you got that much in. 
291,"As someone with ADHD, I can tell you that it is always good to examine exactly how your particular manifestation of ADHD impacts your life. 

ADHD may be impacting your impulse control. Or, you may be an adrenaline junkie. Paradoxically, stims help us calm down and focus. Cheating is bad, exciting, titillating--so could you be in a way medicating yourself by creating one thrilling, scary situation to focus your life around after another. 

Have you ever done sports, especially fast paced, daring ones? Is there a chance that running, martial arts, climbing, or whitewater kayaking might scratch that itch that affairs are fulfilling for you at the moment? 

What is your career? Is there another career that might be more exciting? 

In other words, what are you getting out of these affairs that you could get in a more constructive fashion? 

Lastly, how are you treating your ADHD? You should be on meds and therapy, and don't let anyone shame you about taking meds. It is not easy to adjust to modern society with all its constraints. If meds can help, that does not make you an addict or junkie. "
292,"No he only does it at home. He'll actually avoid nitpicking in public. I don't think he realizes and I think I need to make it a bit more clear that it hurts. He did it once after telling him Saturday and I said ""hey, are you nitpicking again?"" and he apologized. He's never told me to I'm too sensitive or made me feel like it was my fault. I think it's just a bad habit he needs to break. This is apparently how he communicates with his close group of guy friends.  Which I find strange, but they've been friends since like elementary school. "

294,"&gt; What is motivating you to continue a relationship with this person?
&gt; 

OP is enjoying the attention."
295,"I'm not trying to antagonize her. I feel like I've tried being patient and it's gotten me nowhere. I've tried waking her up whenever daughter cries (like she wants) so she can deal with it instead but then obviously that makes everything worse the next day, because she doesn't get any sleep.

I'm just fed up with it. I can't leave my daughter sitting in a dirty diaper until mom's finished pumping just because mom's too paranoid to let me do it. It's killing me inside to be treating like a child abuser, in my opinion the worst thing a person could ever be, just for existing."
296,"I totally second what everyone else says, but to me the biggest red flag here is that he blamed YOU for this. If he thought he misguidedly but genuinely thought he was being kind by doing this, *maybe* it is something I could get over if I were you, but basically saying you made him do it because ""you know you don't handle bad news well"" and refusing to apologize....**that's** the deal breaker."
297,You have no obligation to your ex-wife she is a terrible person forget about her and just focus on your daughters and your own life. 
298,"&gt;  and came to me and told me everything upfront

And then his ex just happened to contact you with her version of events shortly after? Sounds kind of fishy to me.

&gt; He pointed out that she admitted herself that she had mental health problems. His brother just wasn't used to seeing him get so angry, and he had a crush on the ex, so of course he wants to play both sides, he said.

Remember how you gave him kudos in the first part of your post about how he ""took responsibility"", now here he is shifting the blame. He took responsibility for a certain version of events, and when that was contradicted, he tried to throw his own brother under the bus."

300,"I want my parents to be happy, just wasn't necessarily sure how I should act to show my support.

301,"Yeah. It really sounds like pretty normal teenager stuff amplified by ""my dentist mom had a 3 year old"" (my dad was a dentist and I don't think he was ever home before 9 or 10pm) and ""my dad is really easygoing"" (aka lazy PoS). Plus people harping on her weight. Bet she feels great and loved."
302,"The mother *is* an abusive parent; she abandoned her children, which is a terrible form of abuse. Even worse, she abandoned them in a situation that she knew was dangerous.

Honestly, if I were OP, I would be enraged. His mother waltzed out of their lives because it was too hard to deal with them, and then she built a happy new life and made new kids to replace them. I would want to confront her and let her happy little family know that she's a soulless monster... and then drop suit for ten years of back child support."
303,"&gt; How long was a few minutes anyway? Because you've made it sound like it was 2 or 3 minutes when for all we know it could've been 10 minutes or 20 minutes you were playing tongue hockey.

doesn't really matter, because she cheated, and that's honestly the only thing that matters."
304,"OK, I read wife's version,  I'm out"
305,If I were OP I'd be very wary of accepting a drink from this dude.
306,"I feel like this is brutally honest. The trust is gone. He's wondering if the past 3 years of your ""loving"" relationship is a lie and you don't actually love him.

It's really hard to regain the trust that you have built. The thing that others have said is that it's all up to him to forgive, but it's hard, if he still respects you, he would (never) ask you to stop partying, to check your messages. Your relationship was  built on that trust and this freedom. As a guy I wouldn't want to take your freedom and that's why a break up occur, because it'll never be the same, I like a girl that can party and have a great time, and by stopping you from partying, it would also stop you from being who you are. You have to give up your freedom... until he heals. And I agree with this person above, go to him and offer your compromise, it's not the same if he asks you to stop partying, you have to be willing to give this up for him"
307,"Right? I almost can't believe this. I'm actively entertaining the idea that this is fake. I mean, kids are such a huge and significant thing, you really have to make a royal fuck of a fumble to never even make a comment directly to your partner. Not even a 'when we have kids' remark *once* with a woman he was planning to start a family with? 

If this is real, then these two must be very inexperienced with relationships or something. Not that I've conducted studies or anything, just that... I mean, I'll shit on my neighbors head if someone can prove that most couples, who end up married, don't have some kind of conversation about this stuff. "
308,"Do you consider it one of your requirements that your wife / partner be a more-or-less equal contributor to your financial well-being? If so, she might not be the right fit for you, if she doesn't really have any plans or goals to get into a position that is more well-paid. But if you want something more, someone who can be a partner in your life and help raise your family and contribute in ways that aren't necessarily monetary, I don't see any huge blockers here. 

Some couples end up in a situation you worry about, where one person works hard and the other lazes around but given how hard your GF works, it doesn't seem fair for you to suspect that. Honestly you just come across as sort of judgmental that college didn't work out for her and she has ended up working SEVERAL jobs that still leave her paid far less than you make. If you trust her and care for her, I suggest you support any ambitions she has and consider the possibility that she won't be a big earner but can still be a good partner to you. 

I mean what other advice do you expect to get here? ""Ditch her because she's a class below you"" ?? "
309,"I'm guilty of this sort of thing. It usually stems from an internalized belief that no one *really* wants to hear my problems, and trying to talk through them will just bring other people down to my depression... which only serves to make me feel worse than saying nothing in the first place."
310,I disagree. My fiance and I are extremely similar and we've been together nearly 8 years. Being complementary is a personal preference.
311,Complimenting someone after a workout sounds pretty casual to me.

313,"I can tell you from experience that the best way to take an alcoholics rage away from their intended victim and redirect it to yourself is to say something provocative that you know will piss them off. I took a bit of abuse for my little sister that way, but I think it depends largely on the drunk person whether it's feasible. My mom couldn't string together enough coherent thoughts to stay on target when I pissed her off but if she could it might not have worked. "
314,"&gt;What do I do? 

Stop hanging out with them. 

They're not your friends, they don't sound like good people. You will find other people to hang out with, but not if you keep clinging to these guys who seem to be going out of their way to get rid of you. 

&gt; I have social anxiety because I never socialize with my friends 

If you never socialize then of course you're not going to be friends with them. That said, if you have anxiety you need to go to the doctor and get meds/councelling. I think the councelling would be a good idea on it's own. I'm also sure that once you're not spending your time with people who hate you, you'll naturally start to feel better.

Also, in a couple of years you'll be off to uni, and speaking as someone who had severe social anxiety at uni, you want to deal with it before it ruins your late teens/ early twenties. 
"
315,"She's 17, she's acting like any teenager man. Honestly this is not worth it whatsoever. I'd just move on and find someone more mature. "
316,"&gt; they might not even believe me.

The best thing you can do is start documenting everything as much as possible. Who, what, where and when. 

""Alice seemed to intentionally bump into me outside conference room 3 at 7:30 am in the morning on Thursday the 10th, while walking with Beth and Jane"" is not something they can just offhandedly disregard, especially if you're able to document 10-12 incidences like this. "
317,"If mom is crashing anniversary plans now, it will only get worse if he moves back home. Coupled with the fact that OP thinks three days is a long time to go without seeing his mom, if I were the gf, I'd seriously consider whether this was a good long term prospect.

ETA: based on this, and guilting op into moving back by making her financial issues his problem, it seems like mom doesn't have boundaries. I am close with my mom but never in a million years can I imagine her doing this."
318,This needs to be a private custodial legal action taken by you. 
319,"I didn't; I just went over the post itself.  You're right, that's definitely disordered eating.  "
320,"You are so right. They just put a façade towards others, but they don't care about anyone but themselves. With OP he feels he doesn't have to pretend anymore, she won't go anywhere. 

He is a very selfish, self centered person. Up to OP to decide if she can live like that for the rest of her life, he won't ever change. "
321,"Ok, bit more insightful answer:



It seems weird. If you'd be living in London or whatnot then it'd be understandable that this guy would hang around a bit longer, but 2 weeks in a smaller city seems excessive. Unless he just wants to use your city as a base to travel around the rest of the country, but dunno if that makes sense logistically.


Fact is, you don't know much about this guy, he might just be chill and he might be a sleazy dude trying to rekindle some old flame. 



What you *don't* want to do is act insecure about this. I mean, you have been dating this girl for a few years, you live together, that's pretty serious stuff and it seems doubtful she'd throw that away for 2 weeks of 'fun'. But if you go all crazy/clingy/insecure then she might just feel turned off by your behavior.


Ask your girl what they have planned. Maybe tag along during an activity to see what the dynamic is. Be chill, trust your girl even if you don't trust this guy. "
322,"&gt; K's kids are also horrible. They have gotten better, but I'm constantly bickering with them and they are absolute brats.

Dude. You're an adult and you're bickering with toddlers.

&gt; She will struggle more than ever if I leave her, and it'll put the kids through more pain.

I mean, when the other option is living with a virtual stranger that doesn't like them and keeps fighting with them, tbh I'm quite sure the kids will overall be happy that you're gone."
323,"There's a difference between picking four locks to read someone's personal diary, and being vague about someone who's texting you because you don't want to deal with your abusive stalker ex. Anyway, trust doesn't work like 'Oh, well she *lied* once so now *he's* allowed to seriously violate her privacy, that's fair!'. No. Be a fucking adult about this."
324,"&gt;  I really want to help her and to build her self-respect. 


How about your own self-respect?  As in, if you had any you'd block her out of your life immediately.  You can't fix her.  She's not a thing that can be fixed, she's a human and she made her own choice to get involved with a married guy, just like you're making a choice to stay involved with someone who's obviously a mess.  Seems like you're both messed up though.  "
325,"You need to understand that, not only did he threaten you, there is a REASON he is carrying a gun.  He is involved in things you are unaware of.  You need to get away from him before you are implicated and end up in jail or dead."
326,"Tell your parents, get a lock. Definitely get a lock, unfortunately read too many gross stories of people being recorded unbeknownst to them, or underwear stealing, etc. He obviously doesn't have many boundaries, enforce your own now just in case."
327,"If you really don't want to go and are worried about not having a job when you come back/the 1500 costing too much, then don't go.

But I think you are seriously overestimating how much it will cost once you get there. I couldn't even imagine spending over $100 per day, unless I was gambling it all away. If the added cost of 225 per day is what really made you say ""no,"" then maybe you talk this out and go. See what she wants to do while there, and what you might want to do. Set a limit of how much you are willing to spend while there. If you are splitting all costs with her, then $750 for flights and hotel + $40 per day (your half) will keep it at around $1000.

You didn't say how much you owe her, but if she expects you to pay for the whole trip, and the amount you owe her is about half, and you do decide to go, you can talk to her about that being her repayment.

It is your choice if you want to go or not."
328,I kinda wonder if she'd be reacting this way if they'd had a boy.
329,"It seems more likely that she's realizing that her time to go on fun vacations like this are about to come to a close for a *long* time, since she's about to have to pass the bar and then focus on getting her career off the ground (which is a notoriously demanding time for first-year lawyers, especially so for women)."
330,No? Who hurt you? OP should have never gotten back into a relationship with her if he was so fragile from the previous break up. 
331,"I know you're having a hard time OP, but I'm going to be blunt with you and tell you how I see it. **He's doing this because he knows he can.** His behavior towards you when you confessed your feelings was despicable. You don't treat anyone the way he treated you, never mind someone who's supposed to be your best friend! But the next day he acted like nothing happened and you didn't fight him on that. You rolled over and took it, he faced no consequences for his disgusting behaviour, so now he sees you as a doormat for him to walk all over.

He is not your friend. Friends do not treat each other the way he treated you, kicking you out of his apartment for crying over the awful things he said to you. And now he's decided that you're in a relationship and that he can tell everyone you're boyfriend and girlfriend? Fuck that. He doesn't deserve you in his life OP, you're too good for him and his mean, immature mind games. **Tell him no.** No, he is not your boyfriend. No, he does not get to decide that. No, you do not deserve to be treated the way he's treated you and no, you won't stand for it. 

Seriously OP, you need to sit back and ask yourself if this is the kind of man you want in your life in any capacity besides distant work colleague. If your friend came to you with this situation, what would you say to them? Would you tell them to go ahead and be in a relationship with someone who can be so callous and flippant about their feelings? I sincerely hope not. If you'd tell a friend that they deserve better, *then why don't you deserve the same thing?*"
332,"I'm sorry your parents seem to be favouring your brother over you. It sucks, but this dynamic can be kinda common when it seems one child Is struggling more then the other. 

I come from a pack of seven kids and it used to INFURIATE me when, growing up, my brother would receive more attention and encouragement when it came to being social. If he was invited to a birthday, they'd drive him there and give him money to buy a gift. I, on the other hand, had to make my own way. When I finally confronted my mum she looked at me with shame and horror and said 'your brother needs more help then you do.'

And she was kinda right. He'd been badly bullied when he was younger and never had friends, while I was a but of a social butterfly.

Problem is, it continued even after he'd settled into a social circle - probably out of habit. I don't think your parents are acting out of malice - just habit from wanting to see both their kids succeed. The saying 'the squeaky wheel gets the oil' has never been truer. 

Talk to them. Ask them if they're proud of you too. Let them know your feelings because it's entirely possible they're so focused on getting your brother to succeed they've neglected to remember you. 

Also congrats on all those degrees! Whoah."
333,"Screw patting him on the head, if he calls OP by the wrong name she should swat him with a rolled up newspaper or spray him with a spray bottle. ""Bad Matt!"" *sprays water*"
334,"It's a bit hard to tell from your info if he's got anxiety about eating other foods or he's just a lazy college guy. My partner is a very picky eater but gets a lot of anxiety when you try to get him to eat new food. He happens to eat pasta, chicken or steak which I also usually eat (but I eat anything) so I don't have much of a problem having those meals when we're hanging out and new, different meals when we're not. 

Does his pickiness get in the way of other things like going out to eat etc? If it does and you enjoy going out to eat, this is likely not going to be a sustainable relationship. Pickiness with food for some stems from anxiety issues so if that's the case for him, he won't really be able to change this without counselling etc. If he's in college there's probably some free counselling there he could try if he wants to change this. "
335,I have no idea why she agreed to go along with the marriage.... 
336,"A 3 month contract is very short. Maybe she'll find full time employment soon, you never know. This isn't the end of the world.

And if the vacation is next week, wouldn't her family lose money if she didn't go? Are there nonrefundable tickets?"
337,Don't ever expect that she will change. If she's not what you want as a girlfriend you should move on.
338,"Dude, if your aunt didn't *accidentally* get too drunk and spill the beans, you never would have found out this coward still existed. If she had attempted contact that would be a totally different situation, but she obviously has had no need to contact you for the past 20 years. This person doesn't deserve your love. "

340,"At the same time, don't let her failure drag you down. Last thing you want is a college drop out attached to you who has  no sense of self motivation. God knows what other aspects of her life she does this with (ie finances) "
341,Frankly I do not understand. I literally can't wrap my mind around why you'd be upset at this.
342,"So she was a coward, texted you in a joking matter that she was gonna cheat, and then tries to say she talked to you about this and gets a loophole?  


Please. I wouldn't be surprised if she's done this before with how nonchalant she's being about it.  How are you not broken up already? "
343,"How is it sexist? 

The mom doesn't have to worry about her children not being her own, the dad however should be made to live with a child that isn't his? Why ? Why should he pay for his wife's infidelity and not the guy she cheated with? She made her decisions and she should pay for it, she CHOSE to give up her son so she could continue to have a life of comfort. A life of luxury was more important than her son.

Please, give me a good explanation about why the father is a bad man for not wanting to raise another person's child? "
344,"I think you should feel good that you helped someone in need. I also think that your two points 

&gt;I should probably give up on her because : 1. I can't help her. 2. She probably doesn't like me back and i'm overthinking it.

are spot on. "
345,"She's being ridiculous. You're allowed to not really like it. She's allowed to not care that you don't really like. Everyone is allowed to go on with their lives. Gosh, imagine how she'll handle a real conflict . . ."
346,"&gt;And lose her 2 daughters I guess?

Where the fuck are you getting this from? 

&gt;Plenty of people remarry or raise children from previous relationships. 

Are you genuinely incapable of understanding the difference between these situations and the one where your wife cheats on you with another man and gets pregnant by them? 

&gt;It's not the babies fault and it's still his wife's baby. 

And neither of those facts obligate the man to raise the child. 

&gt; Is this some male insecurity thing?

Holy shit, could you be more sexist1? 

&gt;because he doesn't want to spend money on a third kid. 

It's not his child. He should not be obligated to do shit about it, given the circumstances. 

&gt;That's some weird sexist shit right there. 

No, the sexist in this whole mess is you. You have some distorted view on how reality should operate, on how men should just bow down to whatever you think is right. I'm honestly starting to consider you're trolling, given your other responses in the thread, because no one sane would actually blame OP's father for giving that choice to his wife. In fact, if he'd been here, 99% of us would have told him to divorce his wife, regardless of what she did with the child. 

"
347,"He sounds super gross. You could take a crack at educating him, but his mind is so engrossed by heterosexist shit I'm not sure how far you'll get with him. You could maybe start asking when is it considered cheating if you got with a girl? Then, how come? If he doesn't consider it sex, then what is it? "
348,"Half Asian here- I've never been bullied exactly, but if you grow up being told you're different you do start to feel it. I found a national organisation for youth of my ethnic background whose members are interested in community-building which has helped a lot with identity and feeling more included. Many of them are also ""fractional"". I'm not sure if there's anything like that in your country for your background but if there is that might help."
349,"You would be wrong. I don't think that about cleft palates so I certainly wouldn't say it.

Many of us don't find a cleft palate so horrifying. There is nothing really to talk about. I find it pretty easy to look at a person with a cleft palate without gagging.

I'd be more interested in getting to know my friend's girlfriend rather than mocking her appearance to mutual friends. What kind of friends are those? They have nothing better to talk about?"
350,The fact that he is on Tinder talking to other girls means that the relationship is not as healthy as you think. I believe at this point be is just using you for sex.
351,I keep going back to that part about double checking. You should NOT have to double check because who in their right mind would expect their fiance to do something like that to them the night before a huge job interview that they were so excited about??
352,I wouldn't be with someone who was into alt-right hate. Period. It doesn't matter what kind of mask he wears out in public. 
353,"She has ALL the power right now. He'd have to prove he's the biological father first and then he'd have to sue her for visitation rights to protect himself, or at least get her to sign some legally binding document giving him access to the son. "
354,"&gt; I have my own hobbies, perspective, ideas, morals to follow, self love, basically being my own person, that until I get into a relationship..


Could this be that you create an interesting personality for yourself for dating purposes and let that go when you make it to a relationship? Like getting lazy when you reach a certain goal?


&gt;Then I become incredibly uninteresting, I unconsciously give up my hobbies, my ideas outlook change into that of a fake boring general one. I stop taking care of myself, I become incredibly hypocritical, naive, and a weak willed person. 


Or could it be that you start to compare yourself too much to your partner and start to have inferiority complex and give up trying? "
355,"I think you need to be more patient. You had a child about 3 months ago, and your wife wasn't even cleared for sex for the first half of that assuming her doctor follows the typical recommendations. That means in about 6 weeks of being 'cleared' you did it once, it was painful and uncomfortable for her, and you have a newborn! She is probably still tired and perhaps feeling uneasy about her body and still riddled with hormones. 

It is absolutely worth talking about, because you have needs of course. I'm not saying to not bring it up. But when you bring it up, do so gently so she knows it is something you are thinking about and interested in, and want to know what she has in mind and what you can do to make it better for her. 

I also suggest counseling. Your tit-for-tat attitude about giving affection if you think you're going to get sex is very concerning. That you have a CRUSH on a friend when you have a newborn at home and a wife who may be struggling is in all honestly inappropriate and something you should shut down immediately. 

Don't be the guy who wallows in self-pity so much at being 'neglected' because his wife who just gave birth isn't up for the regularity of sex you were having before, that he does something stupid like flirts with a girl in your shared friend group. "
356,"Jumping off of this to say. The lifelong care of a high-needs person can be very discouraging for the caregiver. You give and give and you know the person's condition is not going to significantly improve. It's unfortunate, it's not anybody's fault of course, but that's still the reality. So sometimes people will latch on to ""that ONE thing"", like, ""I know my loved one is not going to reach the point of needing less care, but maybe they can get to the point where they can take that once-in-a-lifetime trip.""  I sort of wonder if this is part of OP's mom's fixation on this trip.

And, it's not always bad to have those types of goals. But you have to keep it realistic and from the sounds of it, OP's mom isn't."
357,"&gt;I straightened up and gave him a nudge in the side with my foot and he made a fist and hit me hard on the leg right in front of his mother. I was shocked and I pushed him with my foot in the same place and he hit me again, even harder

So you kicked him, he hit you in the leg, you kicked him again, and are shocked when he hits you on the leg again?
"
358,"WTF, why not just ask?? Maybe this is her way of being flirtatious? I mean, you have nothing to lose here. You're not emotionally invested. Fucking ask."
359,That's mind-bogglingly selfish of her. 
360,"True, but I like think optimistically. "
361,"Oh, that wasn't there when I posted. My answer still stands, though--having a dream school is one thing and what's best for your reality may be quite a different thing. 

Edit: additional thought, this may be worthwhile to cross post to r/gradschool or a sub where more people are aware of the intricacies around grad school, picking programs and funding. That's a huge component that may be absent in some responses here or at least might be able to give a good perspective. "
362,"So,  to recap - he calls you demeaning names and chokes you?

365,"She kept this from you for 6 months and you found out on Sunday by reading text messages between them. She works with him and continued to be in contact  and stopped only after you found out. She did not plan on telling you. Yes postpone the wedding and then end the relationship. Understand that they did not just accidentally or casually happen to meet up and then out of the blue a hand job and fingering ensued -until they both orgasmed. There as an emotional affair leading up to this, clearly planned and orchestrated to pursue and satisfy their sexual desires and attraction for each other hence the continued texting and deceit. Total betrayal and disrespect for you and the pending marriage to you. Absolutely dispicable and disgusting of her. EDIT: I see she did this particular act before she got engaged, still does not make  any difference -she cheated.

""We are supposed to do couples counseling next week, and as much as it hurts, I want to try and trust her again"".  I would not be so optimistic. Remember you are believing what she told you as the whole truth which I seriously doubt.  There is more to this. She has only given you the soft part. There appears to be an emotional affair for six months up until you found out. That's pretty telling, along with no guilt, no remorse, no confession until she was caught and you want to rebuild trust and marry this person? You need to press her for the whole truth/details and let her know her truthfullness/honesty will determine the future of the relationship going forward."
366,It sounds like you're pressuring her to go. She just explained that her friends don't want to hang out with her. And prom is NOT the time and try and mingle with people you never hung out with. Because they're gonna be hanging with their friends. 
367,"Honestly, be blunt. Don't try to say you aren't sure you can help with the baby, because she'll only say that she's sure you'll do just fine. Tell her you're happy to have her along, but this is a trip for just the two of you. No babies allowed. "
368,"Despite what redditors seem to think...

If you're in the US in a no-fault state, you need video evidence to get a divorce granted on the grounds of adultery. There is no financial ""punishment"" for having an affair.

(I had a no-fault divorce from my ex because of an affair. I had very damning evidence. I just got out as peacefully and fairly as possible--and that meant a collaborative, no-fault divorce).

Having said that, she deserves to know. But your priority is dealing with your fiancee.

371,"I came in here to tell you to move out and be your own person, but I can't.

You're an addict, and I want to congratulate you and praise you for your recovery and wish you well in your continued recovery and sobriety.

That being said, as I'm sure you know, you erode a lot of trust when you put your family through addiction.  They are likely TERRIFIED that you are going to slide back into addiction.

Here's my suggestion, and I hope that everyone involved is open to it.  Are you in family counseling at all?  To help heal what was broken in addiction and to help move forward.  You and your parents working with a counselor can help build boundaries and guidelines to help you in your sobriety and to help gain your independence. You can show them they can trust you as you spend more time outside the house either with your boyfriend or friends, and you can continue to grow and heal.

"
372,"Holy shit.  That is such an amazing gift... like.. on a colossal scale.  You're the best brother/sister ever, and I'm so so sorry.   "

377,"They could if half of his desire for travel wasn't ""needing a break"" from his baby.."
378,"Nope, it's not. I have anxiety (diagnosed and medicated) and therapy has honestly helped me a lot with coping with it. Shouting at myself in my head has never been, and never will be, a good solution to that. It just fuels the anxiety. I'm assuming this is the same for you. I know that my BF loves me with all his heart and all that. Doesn't stop my asshat of a brain from sometimes thinking he'll break up with me over some small issue like forgetting to replace the TP once. And shouting at myself that I'm wrong doesn't solve that. 

A good therapist or counselor will be able to teach you some methods for keeping intrusive thoughts away. You'll have to do the work, but they can guide you along the way. "
379,What makes you think you can help her?  What makes you think you should help her?
380,"Wow, I can't believe how callous he's acting!!  Doesn't he realize how bad he's making you feel here?  I mean, you said 'sorry', what else does he need from you?  He's being very selfish and cruel here."
381,"Well, two ""sins"" occurred here.  Hers was *by far* the lesser, as it turned out.

I'm obliged to point this out due to the number of times confessions of snooping on this subreddit have only turned up petty grievances and the snoopers were excoriated for it.  She gambled with her principles and acted on her gut (and we're all faced with this scenario at some point in life), and it turned out to be well-founded fear.  It doesn't always."

Even if someone was foolish enough to take it seriously, using reasonable force to defend yourself from an assault is not abuse.  "
384,I just wanted to tell you that I was in a relationship like this and it destroyed my self esteem to the point that I am still rebuilding years later. Do yourself a favor and be with someone who considers you number one. With their words AND actions.

386,"This guy sounds like a fucking nightmare, and I don't really care that he ""isn't rude"" as he rejects everything about your life together. His personality sounds intolerable; if he was rude, it would just be even more intolerable. I'm not going to advise you to end your relationship, but I will suggest that you think *long* and *hard* about whether this is *really* how you want the rest of your life to play out.

Imagine trying to raise kids with someone like this. Planning vacations with someone like this. Making medical, educational, or career decisions with someone like this. Any number of decisions that married couples have to make together, all made even more difficult than they already are by someone who's inordinately picky, but somehow has no idea what he wants and ""no time"" to think about it. Sounds pretty bleak to me. "
387,"When he's angry and when you're fighting are two different things. 

When he's angry, at say, the computer, I think it's fine for him to curse. It might be a little scary, but at the end of the day he's not hurting anybody. 

When you're fighting, if he's cursing at you, the issue isn't his cursing, it's that he's verbally attacking you. The problem is tone and intent. Yes, it's healthy in addition to fair and ok to ask him to discuss relationship issues without attacking you. 

Cursing can still be an ok way to vent anger in a tense discussion about a relationship, but the key is, is it directed *at* you? Or is it directed at the situation, around his own feelings of frusteration or whatever? Are you a team trying to solve a mutual problem? 

I still think this leads to a much tenser environment. It might be good for you guys to have a cool off period before you discuss stuff.  "
388,"You acknowledge that OPs boss is being unreasonable and in the next sentence you ask why OP is certain about leaving?

390,"Yeah this bicycle solution is kind of ridiculous. Using a bike to get around is hilariously impractical in most places. I only live a 15 minutes car ride from school and i could never bike that distance where i live. The terrain is extremely mountainous, its freezing cold, theres no street lights, a lot of narrow roads, and manaic drivers. And this is coming from someone who walked everywhere when i lived in a more pedestrian friendly area. OP should just use that 10k to get a shitty car. "
391,"I appreciate your reply and am intrigued by your view. I really don't want to come off as pushy and tone-deaf, which I suspect I have, but I also feel the same way about her extensively dodging the road where I meet her friends. So I guess what I'm saying is, how can we find a happy medium? I wouldn't feel this way had I met at least one friend because sometimes I wonder if her friends even know I exist. "
392,"I read this post hours before you ever commented and it was in there. There are also no markers stating the post was edited, something the OP can't work around if she's editing it more than five minutes after posting. So no, she didn't edit it, you just apparently skimmed instead of reading so you could accuse OP of being unfair to this woman."
393,Lol. We're you expecting a *hug* at the end of each paragraph? 
394,"Crushes happen in relationships. So what you do is CUT IT OFF!

You back off from your crush. No hanging out. Texting. If you can't avoid her, keep it professional only at work. No other socializing. Until your feelings are gone and you're back on track. 

If you continue forward you'll end up emotionally cheating at the very least."
395,"OP, sorry but this is as unrealistic as it is dangerous.  This idea isn't how the real world works.

Tell your landlord that you suspect that a key was duplicated and pay for re keying ***now*** and have an officer with you.  Who the hell cares about how your landlord feels about it, you're the one paying.

You are setting yourself up for direct harm, and no, you can't count on a *drug dealer* to come to your rescue.  You can't even count on a dealer to be where they're supposed to be.  No matter how close you are money is always going to make him walk and I'm alarmed that you are relying on one in the first place.  

My dad was a dealer.  Yes they all seem genuinely nice, and no, they are ***not*** all genuinely nice, and as of now it's clear that you are not the best judge of male character (as you have mentioned).

None of these plans are in the least bit reasonable or practical.  They all put you in further risk and it concerns me that you are not changing a major dangerous pattern of poor judgement with men (as you mentioned).

Being reactive is not a plan here.  It's a theory of how the world works, and it is a very flawed way of thinking.

Please be reasonable and realistic."
396,You should say exactly that to your aunt. 
397,"They've been together 3 years but the OP and her SO are still in their early 20s. If the OP moved in with her BF, it would make the breakup much more difficult that it should be.

400,"This is so inappropriate and damn disrespectful to you and to the marriage. The way I see it is that he is so into her I'd venture to say in love with her that he is now trying to prove/to show how much he loves her that he will throw her this baby shower and have his wife organize it all (humiliate his wife) to treat his crush like a fucking queen. Op should have flat out refused and the co-worker knowing OP's obsession with her should have declined the gesture; but to me she is also going along with all this. I guess OP's husband is hoping that the co-worker will eventually fall for him after all of this extraordinary display. This man is using his wife to get another woman to fall in love with him, how much shittier can this get?"
401,"Please don't fear him. That seems like bullying and you don't deserve it. If you wanted to show him up, email everyone including him and drop out of the baby shower asap. You go find the best three divorce attorneys that will put the screws to your husband. Get that MFers attention. Your husband treats you poorly. It's time to have his balls in your back pocket or on a mantel. please keep us updated. "
402,😂😂😂
403,"&gt; Exactly! He could have easily scheduled his vasectomy closer to January and prolonged the relationship,

This wouldn't have accomplished anything.  Unless, of course, he had hid the fact from her and deceived and mislead the OP for the next 8 or 9 months.  I don't think that would have been a good option."
404,"you were sexually assaulted.  many people freeze when they're sexually assaulted and it's not their fault.  you did NOT cheat.  people think there are only 2 responses to this kind of situation, fight or flight. but there is a third: freeze.  and that's what you did.  this is not your fault and you didn't do anything wrong."
405,"I'd probably have an entirely different reaction if later on he sat her down, made an effort to understand and then was like 'hey, I hate to say this and I'm sorry to hurt you, but I'm not comfortable with this so I think we should break up'. That's not what he did, though. He freaked the fuck out, he expressed revulsion and disgust, he stormed out, he didn't even give OP the chance to explain. *That* is what makes him a jerk, the fact that he let fear and hatred rule the day. "
406,"Do you have any friends at all that you can trust?  If I were you, I'd book the appointment, and leave to stay at a friend's house for a few days.  Use the excuse that you're too angry and need some time to cool down.  


Even if you can't trust the friend - get a taxi and go to the appointment alone, and then another cab to take you to the emergency room entrance of the nearest hospital.  Call your friend and tell them that you were grocery shopping or something and that you started bleeding, so you went to the ER where they told you that you miscarried.  Then the friend can help you with your aftercare without knowing exactly what it is for.  Maybe your family can help you after that.  Tell them whatever you have to - that you knew your body would reject the pregnancy again, that the stress of it all was a major contributor - you can definitely make this believable.  Lie as much as you have to if it means that you will have a safe place to go.  I'm so sorry that this is happening to you, unfortunately the most abusive people often prey on those that they believe are weak.  Little does he know, he's completely fucking wrong!  Dealing with this medical stuff for so long has probably made you stronger than any of us.  "

408,"Spitting in someone's face is not only fucking disgusting, but also classed as assault (in the UK at least; I'm not sure where you're posting from) and I would be very concerned about his behaviour escalating to physical violence.

This relationship is extremely unhealthy. You don't say exactly how long you've been in therapy for, but it doesn't sound like your husband is taking it very seriously and I think you should be considering very carefully about whether this marriage is the right thing for you."
409,"""Normal"" as in the majority? No. ""Normal"" as in not unheard of? Yes. But it's certainly uncommon. CDC Stats show that 12% of children born in 2013 were breastfed (at least partially) until 18 months, and they don't show data beyond that.

&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that breastfeeding continue for at least 12 months, and thereafter for as long as mother and baby desire. The World Health Organization recommends continued breastfeeding up to 2 years of age or beyond.

I remember reading somewhere that if humans breastfed proportionally to lifespan as other animals do, we would breastfeed until age 7. 

I quit at four months for my mental health, so I can't even imagine going that long."
410,"Does it matter what he expected? Do you want to resolve the situation going forward or do you want to analyze the past and not resolve the problem going forward?

If you want to resolve the problem going forward, then let's talk about the possibilities for the future - not talk abotu where we can lay blame in the past. 

No matter what conversations were had in the past, at this point in time you and your husband are at a disagreement on how to raise your children. 

The things that need to be resolved at this point in time are: 1) Must the children follow dietary restrictions during holidays? 2) You feel disrespected by him and he needs to apologize and be more sensitive. 

Both of those can be resolved with a nice serious conversation, no?"

Stop being his maid/mother.

I hadn't even considered their economic situation in all of this... Which makes it even harder to say no. I don't owe anything to my sister, but I feel like I owe it to my parents to help them, even though I know it'd just wreck my economy and credit score. :(

&gt; The only person here who deserves help is your niece. Don't provide cash. Buy school supplies, or pay for school trips, or whatever you feel comfortable giving. Don't buy her electronics that can be taken by Monica and sold.

And, of course, they've been dating long enough to be engaged. If boyfriend is a stranger, it seems like there was time to remedy that if he had non-controlling-douche motives. And we know he isn't a stranger, because the sister has known him for years. "
420,Thanks man... I appreciate it.  All my kids are in therapy at the moment due to everything.  The youngest are being treated for PTSD and the eldest was showing signs of schizophrenia.  Thankfully over the last few months they've really turned things around.  I couldn't be prouder of them.
421,"Would you continue living in a place where you need to have a gun to feel like your family is safe if you had kids? Part of her concern is having kids around a gun (or vice versa,) am I correct? So if you live in a dangerous place now, would you consider moving somewhere safer where your kids aren't at that kind of risk? 

That could be a compromise, that you continue to have guns until you have kids and then move where you wouldn't need them? I don't know where that leaves hunting rifles, though."
422,I'm definitely gonna get these people out of my life as soon as possible. It hurts a lot because I did trust some of these guys and think of them as friends. I guess I'm gonna have to think about how to be a better judge of character in the future.

I'm not sure why you're supporting cousins family to the tune of 12k a year but that's a conversation for another day.

This decision does benefit the both of you in that you are both closer to work/school and he does mention that he wants to save for an apartment for the both of you. 

So think positive. I don't think it will ruin things unless you  let it. It seems like something two need right  now. You can try having date nights once a week, in addition to the other times you guys will usually see each other. This can help adjust you two to the change, bring back a little more excitement with each other as if it's when you two first started dating. Remind you two that this is something to look forward to when the time comes to move in together again. "

It sounds to me like you need to stop relying so much on people around you to make you feel okay. It needs to be okay for you to be alone and by yourself. Time to focus on some hobbies or watch movies/take a bubble bath or whatever you need to do to make yourself feel better.

Love will destroy your life, given the ability to do so.  Love's an elemental thing, meaning that if you give it control over your path and your choices, ignoring all the other ways that this relationship is very bad for you, all you'll have left at the end when the love burns out is hurt.

&gt;Needless to say I have trust issues

So get a therapist.  Use that therapist to help you work through the emotional snarls brought on by the breakup which, again, I am totally giving you permission to do.

If not for yourself, for him.  Because he's a douchebag, and I think he'd be a shitty boyfriend for anyone as he is now--and being with him, you're keeping him from any chance of becoming a better, healthier person who could be good for someone else.

445,Do you watch porn? Yes? Then don't be so surprised when your gf watches porn. Does the fact you watch porn mean your gf isn't enough for you? 
446,"&gt; You shouldn't have been put into this position to begin with, let alone have to think about the logistics of a naked woman getting home without getting arrested for indecent exposure.

Well OP put herself into that position while reading what looks like a very long message (judging on the level of detail she knows), not as if she couldn't have looked away when she saw coworker got a private message. "
447,"&gt; Also, even if the letter was truthful your stepbrother lied to you.

How did he lie? She wanted him to contact his mother, and he gave a letter that said what he had to say. "
448,Your title seems a bit confusing at first with the leaving of the M/F part in as not sure if that was a mistake or on purpose.
449,It's up to 6 months some STDs lay dormant so I recommend 6 months to repeat testing. Get the comprehensive one where they take your blood!
450,Omg you trying to make excuses for your behaviour and explaining just why she's ignoring you is coming off as extremely creepy. If someone was staring at me for 5 mins and trying to make eye contact when all I want to do is avoid eye contact so I won't have to talk to him. I would run the other way if I even see that person from far away
451,"Bro, I think your jealousy and controlling tendencies are what's making her lie to you about this stuff. Honestly. You seem pretty over-bearing.

Who cares if you hangout with girls alone? That wasn't the point the other user made. 

&gt; If my girlfriend is out and bumps into a guy friend and they have coffee, she doesn't tell me she's at the library, she'll tell me she ran into Joe Blow and they're talking for a bit because she knows she's not up to anything.

You can totally hangout with girls just you and a friend that is a girl. There's no reason you shouldn't be able to do that, if you are a loyal and trustworthy person. The problem here is you seem to think otherwise: if your girlfriend is with ANY guy alone, no matter if they've been friends forever, it's immediately deemed as untrustworthy and she is up to something. And you wonder why she isn't upfront with you??? 

You say you want her to keep her friends and you don't have a problem, but there are lines to be set. I feel like your GF doesn't tell you who she is with because even if it IS innocent, you're going to think otherwise no matter what she says. She still wants to have friends, so she is going to hangout with them anyways, and I honestly think that YOU are the one making her feel like she CAN'T be honest with you because even when she is, you think she's a liar and up to no good. That would make anyone feel shitty, especially when they aren't doing anything wrong. 

Also a side note of something that really bothered me, was the problem you had with the one guy friend who posted a photo of her for her birthday. Why do you think you fucking own your GF and no man is allowed to interact with her?! It was a FRIEND from MIDDLE SCHOOL that made a fucking birthday post wishing her well, and they called each other a NICKNAME they've had for each other since, again, MIDDLE SCHOOL, before you and your GF even knew each other existed. And this is.....disrespecting the relationship? Seriously dude you need to do a self evaluation and give yourself a bit of a reality check and then come back and look at this situation. Your GF is allowed to have friends, just let her be honest with you and don't accuse her of shit when she is. 

Another side note, the whole calling thing... if you call someone, and they don't pick up, they're probably busy or don't have their phone? You don't call them 7 more times until they pick up. You wait until they see the missed call and respond to you. 

Seriously man. You sound super over bearing and if I were your GF, I would probably hide hanging out with friends from you too because I knew even if I wasn't doing something wrong, you would accuse me of something. So I would eliminate the possibility of me being accused of shit I never did by just not telling you I'm with guy friends. 

I'm really sorry that all of that was pretty harsh, but I'm not sure how to sugar coat it for you. I hope you don't take offense. 

EDIT: Also, making fun of girls who hit on you while your GF is not there is not appropriate or adult like at all, it makes you look and sound like a 5th grade bully on the playground, and it's incredibly immature. Even if they know you're dating and your GF isn't there, you don't need to make fun of them all night. You can politely turn them down and tell them that you're in a committed relationship and have no interest in having any type of romantic relations with anyone else. Boom. Simple as that. You don't need to call them out and incessantly embarrass them - especially if it was a girl who didn't even know you have a GF. That's just immature and shitty to do.  "
452,"This is absolutely what I thought. OP must not really care about her own boundaries if she keeps bringing the dog back.

Oh but then OP will say how will she find someone else to watch her dog for free cause she can't afford a kennel. Why a 22-year-old buys a dog knowing they won't be home all day I do not know."
453,"&gt; I'm going to agree with this comment. Just from personal experience and what I've noticed from friends my age; once you hit your mid-twenties, your social media use and your need to disclose everything about your life and romantic relationship/s on social media dwindles.

This is exactly what I was getting at, OP.

Really think about the fact your boyfriend told your uncle he would 'tell him about your pussy' later. How incredibly disgusting... You need to have a serious conversation with him discussing why he thinks that is appropriate. I would consider that a huge red flag, aside from the aggressive breach of privacy."

462,"&gt;Likewise, taking an infant on an extended vacation is madness - you will hate each other, and everyone around you will hate each other.

We're lucky that we had a relatively chill baby, but we took our baby to Cancun, London, and Spain in his first year of life, and all those trips were honestly nothing but awesome. Plus a couple of US-based trips for family weddings and such (Baltimore, Richmond)

Yeah, it's a different kind of vacation - slower paced, more breaks, no drinking and clubbing into the night, no day-long hikes. But it was still so, so fun - I don't know, maybe OP only likes adventure-type vacations where they hike Machu Picchu, but you can absolutely vacation with a baby and have a blast. IDK why OP is so convinced he cannot have a nice international vacation unless the baby stays home. Honestly, I think before the baby can walk is the best time to take them - once they start wanting to run around by themselves, they're so much harder to corral. "

487,"Well, I think reducing people to a number 10 point scale is pretty ridiculous. Of course, conventional attractiveness is a thing, and much is made of it, but what matter most is what you think of her and what she thinks of you.

And honestly, it sounds like she likes to show you her affection and love by pumping you up. That's a great thing, even if you take the out of 10 ranking thing with a grain of salt.

&gt; I love her personality, we have so much in common ... I find her sexy as hell. I compliment her looks, and I love having sex with her.

Dude, it sounds like she's ringing all of your bells loudly. Unless there's something that's bothering you, there's nothing weird about it.

An enthusiasm gap is something to take note of, but I wouldn't make more of it than it is and I wouldn't base it on the out of 10 attractiveness scale. If she is heaping the compliments on you and you less so, that could be as simple as a small mismatch in love languages. Like, she expresses her love via raving compliments and talking a lot about her love for you. If you express your love via service/time/gift/touch, maybe there isn't an enthusiasm gap at all. Sure, you may not be able to match her verbal enthusiasm, but that may be because that's not your primary love language. If you're devoting a lot of your time, or doing things for her, or giving her gifts, or expressing your love physically, then that's how you're expressing your enthusiasm. If you are simply not motivated to show your love in any way hardly at all, then yeah, you probably have a relationship problem. But, as evidenced by her verbal enthusiasm, I imagine you're ringing her bell loudly too."

493,"Well, considering that weed is pretty low-key in terms of drugs, and your husband isn't a huge fan of it, then his reaction to you trying a harder drug like coke and acting like it was nothing doesn't surprise me.

 He might be worried about you becoming addicted or wanting to try harder things. Also, some people associate doing all drugs with ""immaturity"" and being married of a certain age is supposed to make you grow out of that.To a non-weed smoker, weed itself is often seen as a ""hard drug,"" so coke is probably a crazy hard drug to him.

 I compare it to this: my husband and I used to be big time pot smokers, now we do it occasionally. He has done coke occasionally, and we've done extacy and shrooms together when we were younger. We have experimented with the extent of drugs we wanted to try, and our experimental phase is pretty much over. If he came home and casually told me he smoked meth or crack, or dropped acid""for funsies"" and acted like it was NBD I would be pissed. Because that's like taking a step backward--we're super grown ass adults now and our experimental days are behind us. We're in a stable, predictable place right now, so why would either of us introduce an unknown into that?

   I think that's how your husband views coke--as a hardcore drug that you missed your window experimenting with so he never worried about it, but now it's in the picture and it's probably making him worry about the unknowns--are you going to want to do it again, will you get addicted, etc. I know lots of people who got addicted to coke easily--I don't blame him for not wanting to have to worry about that in a marriage. 

I think you guys need to talk it out once he's ready and just let him share his side. He might not even really know exactly what freaked him out about it so much. Give him space and then try to talk it out."

I know it's a small thing compared to all the other craziness and unreasonable expectations, but it just shows that she's unreasonable on every level."
497,Yes that's probably so true.

505,"So you had an intimate relationship with the roommate?? I'm not saying his behaviour is justified, but why on earth would you move in with someone who  clearly considers themselves an ex (even if you don't), is manipulative and has feelings for you?

I'm not gonna lie, this is a shitty situation to be in, but I don't feel liek you've helped yourself here. You have three close friends, all of which have had these deep feelings for you, one is now NC, one if manipulating and harassing you, and one you happen to have feelings for. Imagine if you weren't attracted to Arthur, that would be 100% of your friends having unrequited feelings for you. That's kind of weird.

My advise would be move out ASAP, because this won't get better, and please for the love of god, go out and make some female friends! Join a club or something, start chatting to girls at school/work, just form some relationships with people who don't end up confessing feelings to you and ruining it. As a girl, I strongly believe it's *so important* to have female friends. I'm not saying it's your fault these guys fall in love with you (I'm not saying it's not), but this isn't healthy at all."

508,"This guy has serious mental illness, doesn't understand that he's mentally ill, and is on the verge of a religious delusion causing a psychotic break. And since you're in Canada he may not have access to a gun (if this was the US he definitely would). Do not take these things lightly. 

He has threatened to shoot up the office. The police need to be called. Now. "
509,"Exactly so. This is messed up and abusive, especially his berating her for the (entirely natural) results of his repeated refusals to stop and let her use a restroom. In some ways, this reminded me of the posts we had a while back on this sub in which the OP's boyfriend refused to pull over so she could relieve herself. She eventually found out he was sexually into forcing her to pee herself, only he hadn't told her about this kink of his and she hadn't consented to participate. "
510,"&gt; When I get unhappy, he doesn't like it and sort of acts like I shouldn't be unhappy.

Man, if only someone had articulated a way for him to help allay your feelings of frustration. Like some simple things that he could do every day that would make your day run a little easier.

Seriously, the best this guy can muster in the face of your increasing unhappiness is an argument that you just shouldn't be unhappy? That's not the behavior of someone that cares about your feelings, that's the behavior of someone else that is putting their comfort firmly in first place.

Even setting aside the fact that he's mooching off of you (they don't have Xboxes on park benches) and using your apartment as his fuck pad, that's shabby behavior from someone you're in a relationship with. Then he agrees to change his behavior but emotionally manipulates you by threatening to leave?

It also sounds to me a little like you enjoy the idea of this guy, a handsome vagabond, way more than you actual like the reality of him. I think it's time to set your sexy hobo free and find someone that strikes a better balance between fantasy and partner."

515,"Yeah, I don't think she's saying you're obligated to pay her back, I think she's saying that she wants any serious long-term relationship she has to be with someone who approaches things as a team, which includes joining financing for important things like degrees.

Her parents' wealth is totally irrelevant to whether you should help since she may not want to accept their help for grad school or they may have made it clear that she'll be paying for it on her own.  

Recognize though that this may be coming from her family - they may have provided you a job in part so that you could support both of you, as a couple, going forward, which would include professional school that, if you stay together, will help both of you in the long term.

If they gave you a well-paying job while you were in school when you couldn't otherwise get as highly paying of a job, they've essentially partially funded your education.  It is not at all crazy for them to think that you would support their daughter in the same way they've supported you since you'll benefit from any degree she gets long-term."

We all wondered if he was lazy, missed being taken care of like as a kid, or if he developed a kink. He finally open up and said it made him feel a level of love he never had felt before and was scared of losing it. He said it was a different love he felt when he was younger and his parents did everything. This is when we realized he felt the most love through touch."

Also though, having my SO around really does keep me from doing what I want.  It's my own problem, because I feel like I have to include him, or he suggests stuff and I feel bad saying no, etc.  But the end result is that I do what he wants to do and not what I want to do.  You have to unlearn that yourself though, not blame your partner.

I have forgotten to hand my husband's bank card back to him. That sinking feeling when you realize it's in your coat pocket and your SO's day is going to be a bit less smooth. And you know how it's handled? ""Babe I'm sorry I forget to give your card back I have it here."" ""Oh shit! Haha I totally forgot too. I've got some cash for lunch."" Because he is a *fellow adult* and it's his responsibility too.

532,"I have a very similar background to your girlfriend (physically and emotionally abused as a kid, was put in foster care a month before I turned 13, but I don't keep in touch with anyone from foster care like that.) What can happen if you grow up in an abusive home is that you don't really learn what level of emotion is appropriate for a situation. You don't learn how to soothe yourself when you're having difficult emotions, you just learn to bottle it up and pretend things are okay until you explode over a seemingly trivial issue.

As an adult, it's incredibly embarrassing and shame-inducing, which is probably why she brought up breaking up. It's horrible to feel like an out-of-control child when everyone else keeps their shit together when they get upset. It feels like everyone else knows a secret you don't, like you're not good enough to be a real adult.

This isn't something you can change. This is something she needs to seek therapy for. I highly recommend CBT or DBT. On your end, there's a book I would recommend you read called ""Loving Someone with Borderline Personality Disorder."" It doesn't sound like she has BPD, but a lot of the information in that book would probably help you understand how a fucked up childhood can lead to weird adult behaviour, and it will give you some tools to help you cope with her when she gets like that.

Best of luck."

534,"A simple paternity test wouldn't show which one was the father because they share paternity.   They would have to request extra tests to pinpoint the right brother.

However  it's very likely a 14 year old wouldn't know that and the threat alone should  be enough of a scare to stop him trying it on."
535,I call my boyfriend by my coworkers names sometimes...I've also used my brotherd names...I'm terrible at that.
536,"This is the honeymoon phase. He should be showing his best side. This is far from it. It's only been 6 months and he can't control himself. Cut your losses and move on. Why be with someone who threatens to delete your info and speaks to you so disrespectfully? He is acting like an ass and there is no point in being with someone you can't turn to in an emotional time of need. 

As a side note, I'd put money on him worried about how it makes him look that you are upset an ex died. You know you weren't in love with ex and he at least *said* he knew you weren't. I doubt he was OK with it but just said he was and assumes anyone else would think like he does, that you weren't really over ex. "
537,Don't play yourself as the victim. It's good to be called out on problematic thinking. Take it as it is and learn from it. 
538,"Don't lie to yourself.

It sounds like you talked to your crush, not because you wanted a resolution but because you wanted to gauge his interest in you.

You either need to refocus on nurturing your marriage or figure out if you even want to be married. It's not your crush, he is a symbol of the needs that you feel are not being met by your husband/situation in life right now.

Honestly I think you need some time away, like take yourself to the coast and reflect on what you are missing and what you want and how you can fix it. 

Dont do something that will disgust yourself later, stop low key prying your crush for a different answer. Stop being desperate. Look within before you hurt someone."
539,"You are doing your dog a disservice. Stop allowing your aunt to watch him. Immediately. You know she is ignoring the rules, so stop giving her the privilege of watching your animal. 

I've had dogs -still have one-, and I've never babysat them. When I went to work, I made sure they had food, water, puppy pads, and entertainment and then devoted the time before and after work to love, training, exercise, and company. I have security cameras, so I could check in every now and again and make sure that they are doing just fine. I check on my cats several times a day via camera. Is that ideal? No. Ideally, I would have been there 24/7 when they were babies, too.

This may have to be what you also have to do. You cannot trust your aunt with your animal. See if you have a friend that can come by and play and exercise the puppy. "
540,"I think that this would be the best time to pursue things that you would've otherwise been unable to do. Take up classes, go on holiday, do what you always wanted to do but couldn't. Is there anything you gave up to make him or anyone else happy? Don't forget to continue therapy and even seek out support groups. I wish you the best of luck."
541,"I just wanted to say it's really hard to see our parents as more than perfect, and I was not in the least suggesting she didn't love either of you, or make many sacrifices. All I am saying is that she's human too, and if this did stem from jealousy (and fear) I wouldn't be shocked. "
542,I'd rather over estimate with safety than be reckless with sex.
543,"By nature she seems controlling, and raising your brother has probably bent all her planning for the future around protecting him. You have been central to those plans your entire life, up to accepting the guardianship. She has expected you to plan your life around caring for your brother the way she has. Of course you chose to go to school nearby and have stayed nearby, anything else is unthinkable to her. She assumed you were on board with this unspoken plan, but now it seems you're not, so she is very cruelly trying to manipulate you into falling into line with her plans. 

And she is being cruel, OP. The ""real sister"" shit is unconscionable; you came to her in tears to reconcile and she spat venom back at you. I'm surprised you aren't angrier at her. The way you avoid subjects you don't agree with her on makes you seem very afraid to directly confront her and refuse to bend. Have you ever refused her control in anything like this before?"
544,"I know it sucks and it's unfair to Arthur. But frankly, it sounds like it's the best option until May 1. 

However, that means *locked up.* As in, get a deadbolt put on your bedroom door that your roommate doesn't have the key to and keep him safely inside along with food and water (and his extra litter box). She's clearly not above cruelty to animals and she's getting increasingly vindictive. I wouldn't put it past her to do something major to him before she huffs off into the sunset."
545,"So this is the part where you need to TELL him that it IS that serious. That you lack the ability to control your consumption of alcohol (unless there are outside forces controlling that for you). This is where AA and Al-Anon come into play. If you take your health seriously and seek out treatment, he won't be able to pretend its not serious. I know a lot of people associate AA/addiction treatment with people who are wasted 24/7 or who can't function without a substance or whatever, but the truth is there are LOTS of different forms of alcohol abuse and being unable to stop yourself from getting blackout drunk is definitely one of them. If you start looking at it as a health issue, and start TREATING it like a health issue (and it seems as though you're already doing so.) then maybe you will be able to show him that it's a health issue. This is where Al-Anon could be helpful for him. Ask him to go to a meeting so that he can understand where you're coming from. Perhaps couples' counseling would be helpful? A venue for you to express that this is a serious medical issue you're dealing with. Alcohol is part of our culture and you say you can drink socially if there's something cutting you off so I understand it doesn't FEEL dire like it may for some people. You may not be at risk of killing yourself, or losing your job, or whatever. But that doesn't mean you're not dealing with an addiction and it doesn't mean its not serious. You're doing a great thing by attempting to gain control and he owes it to you as your husband to understand and help you accomplish this goal. 

I can't imagine what would make me blow off my fiancé's request to not keep alcohol in the house. I like to have a couple of beers once in a while but I care about his health a lot more than I care about being able to drink at home. that's what makes me think he either doesn't UNDERSTAND the extent to which this is an issue, or there's an underlying issue in the relationship that is causing him to disregard your health concerns. Counseling, meetings, etc. are all super good ideas. 

Good luck on your journey, by the way. It's a tough thing, ESPECIALLY with alcohol (because it's SO ingrained in so many cultures that it's so hard to avoid!) but you're not alone in this and there are people who would be willing to offer you the support your husband is not being so willing to offer (another reason to seek out AA meetings. Even if you decide AA isn't your bag, you may make connections with other people who are willing to support and understand your situation). You sound like you have a good head on your shoulders. "

547,"I think you've got to wonder why he tries to place blame. When he asks ""why did you leave your car lights on?"", what is he looking for? Is he looking for a legit reason that he would understand?

If there was a perfectly good reason for it, would he accept that? (ignore the fact that it was him who turned them on).

I just think it's probably more insidious than that. He doesn't want to hear logic, he just wants to shift/place blame in a way that makes him the accuser, and therefore the one in power. He makes you prove your innocence, then he finds fault in your arguments, and so he never presumes he's the guilty one.

Anyway, this guy was in highschool while you were in the womb, that alone is just too weird."
548,"How do you act neutral when it comes to buying stuff? If the son wants ""girl clothes"", is the neutral act to just buy them with a shrug? Refuse to buy gendered clothing in either direction?"
549,"You know for me, the worst part is that he thinks a ""normal"" boyfriend would consider you a slut for something that wasn't even your fault. I would never be with somebody like this because imagine if this was a stranger. Or if you were raped at a party. Yes you might have been ""naive"" or too trusting, but that doesn't mean it's your fault or that anyone should be calling you a slut. And the fact that he feels like such a great boyfriend for not calling you a slut-when he clearly thinks that this is an appropriate response because no,a ""normal"" bf would not call you a slut- is even more amazing to me. You're young, you have plenty of time to test his theory of ""normal"" bfs and their behavior."
550,"And he isn't going to be any help in the next five years either.  If you are planning on children it's going to be exponentially worse. If he was going to change it would have happened in the last five years.

So now you have to work from the place of he isn't going to change. Do you want to stay married if he never helps? Can you hire a house keeper? Can you do all the cleaning? Can you minimize your ""stuff"" so it's easier to control? "

Also: adolescents? No, adults.

This just IS going to be a tough moment for her, where she decides (*if* she decides!) to go ""modern"" not ""traditional"". But that moment seems like it is long overdue. There is no way to do this without upsetting SOMEONE - her, you, them. But it needs to be HER decision which way she jumps."

557,"I agree with your assessment of her brother, but I think filing for divorce over her disagreement with how they should treat her brother is nuclear. If he isn't literally ready to walk out over this, it also becomes a shitty manipulative game to play that card just to force her to comply. 

She's being rigid and childish, yes, but I don't think we have enough information to conclude she is beyond reach and he should walk."

561,Yeah 3/4 sexually active adult women will have HPV at some point and very few strains cause warts. HPV is not prevented by condoms and unfortunately men can't be tested for it. However it typically clears on its own and is asymptomatic. Regular Paps and overall health are the best method for preventing contraction and spread (along with monogamy and fewer partners in general.)
562,you seem to have addressed none of the issues OP asked about.
563,"Leave, don't think, leave. The fact that it is slowly increasing is all you need to know. "
564,"The way OP wrote out her thoughts so well... This is an incredibly difficult situation, and she seems to be so mindful of her emotions, the emotions of others, and how they all work together.

OP, I sincerely hope you and your husband are able to conceive, because you sound like you'd make a fantastic mother."
565,"To clarify, I'm not the first person that replied to you, I'm just explaining why I agree with that person that OP's ex should get snipped if he really doesn't want kids. He will have a much smaller chance of his girlfriends saying ""fuck it I'm going to stop taking my pills"" if he takes control of the situation "
566,"This really is unusual. And that's sad. Your boyfriend is entitled to affection and non-sexual valuation from his best friend. It is out of the cultural norm, but that is because young men are socialised to be physically distant. It takes something away from us. Female best friends hug and hold hands and cuddle because it makes them feel safe. Men deserve that too when they need it. 

I can see why you're freaked out. It's because you're not used to seeing straight men behave like that. But you should trust your boyfriend. If he is with you, that's for a reason. From what you have described, he seems comfortable showing affection around men. Closeted males sometimes are scared of doing that, since they live in hiding. "
567,"&gt; His female friend went ahead and snapped me back a pic of her face and captioned it ""thanks!"".

That girl is trying it and your boyfriend is allowing it. She is definitely a threat and he needs to either set some boundaries and enforce them, or no longer be with you.

&gt; My bday is coming up and he told me he almost forgot it. He even told me that it wouldn't be a surprise if he forgets my birthday one day only cause he's shit with remembering things.

He's doing that thing where he's being a blatant asshole to you so you'll break up with him and he can go off &amp; have fun with this chick. He's literally telling you he doesn't give a fuck about you and making excuses for something he HASN'T EVEN FORGOTTEN YET. Don't tolerate this crap, you deserve so much better."
568,"You really shouldn't take him on the vacation, no matter how much you want to. Having a vacation lined up is always an additional obstracle during job search, even if you have potential employers interested in you. And since he's already procractinating, he'll just use this as an excuse to avoid doing anything at all until the vacation. And as others said, it will be very uncomfortable for you to follow through with the ultimatum and break up right after the vacation.

You need to tell him right now that you're going alone and that he must get an offer by the time you get back. The time alone will give you strength to end it if necessary."
569,"That's a fantastic reason why she *shouldn't* get on a plane. If she can be happy somewhere local, why not leave it at that? 

He seriously needs to have your back on this. Does he usually back you up on things? I hope this is an aberration.  

If your husband and mom are both working on you, tell them to plan the trip and take her on it while you stay home. Your husband will come crawling back a new and contrite man, hopefully. 

As far as just your mom, since she is pushing you to plan it, the solution is simple: refrain from planning it. 

You are trying to repair a breach that happened at Christmas, but that's not all on you. If your mom is narcissistic, there will always be another issue, and another. So change the subject, hang up when necessary, and don't be afraid of having a blowout when it is an issue that involves hundreds of other people taped together in a steel tube racing through the sky, or customs on foreign soil with their police who openly carry large scary weapons. 

Refrain from planning the holiday. Hang up on Mom. If she books it complete with tickets with your name on them, refrain from going to the airport. Let your husband go if he wants to. 

If a direct no wold cause too many problems, say no with your actions. "
570,I have learned to smile and nod or just block out her comments. Sometimes though I can't help but make faces when she tries to argue with my grandfather about insurance (he wrote a book about it and had his own insurance company) or when she acts like she knows more about my job than I do. I can't even drink to zone her out since I'm pregnant so I've just been avoiding her. 
571,"Bingo.

If you're in a committed relationship, if you claim to love someone, you don't entertain other suitors."
572,"so he's inattentive, verbally abusive, and manipulative.  he sounds like a real gem!

why are you in a relationship with this winner?"
573,You are very welcome!
574,"Yep, so true. How many calories could a spoonful of condiments have? 20 at the most? If you feel guilty over 20 extra calories, I think you're in trouble. I ate so many pickles dipped in mustard I had a sour stomach all the time haha but I still felt guilty for eating at all. 

OP, these are all classic eating disorder behaviors- guilt about eating, being thin, being irrationally scared of obesity, eating condiments, having fear foods and (a very small amount of) safe foods, etc. "
575,"My boyfriend works 40+ hours a week in a shitty call center with shitty customers. His job sucks. His job pisses him off. Not once has he ever come home and called me a bitch, under any circumstance whatsoever.

This isn't ""work stress"", this is abuse."
576,"This is heavily dependent on you.

Personally? I wouldn't have an issue with it even if the guy was straight, so long as I didn't believe there was a temptation to cheat going on. 

Others may have different opinions. "
577,"I mean, as an Aspie I can 100% tell you he does this because he's an asshole. He just is an asshole who also has an autistic spectrum disorder. I don't do shit like that because I make an effort to behave in a pro social way because I like helping people and I don't like hurting people. 

He wants to keep her around, but he doesn't value her wellbeing in an of itself - only as far as she is a means to the end of his happiness. 

I care about my friends, family, and boyfriend not as a means to my happiness but because I love them and want the best for them. This is because I am not an asshole. There is a lot of variety among people with AS. Like people who who don't have AS some are nice, and some are not. And it's not their brain structure that is the ultimate difference between the two - it's choices. "
578,I bet you're being louder than you think.

580,"His reaction to her saying he should contribute to the cost is going to determine whether he's worth keeping as a friend.  It's one thing when he waits and rides home with her when she was coming home anyway, and it's quite another when he treats her like an actual Uber and demands rides to places she otherwise wouldn't have been going.  In the later case, there's more than just the cost of the gas, her time is valuable too."
581,My husband and I read threads to each other on long car rides or if we are waiting for stuff (like to get seated at a restaurant or for a movie to start). We tease each other by implying that the other one wrote the thread and debate what the OP should do. This sub is like a nonstop source of amusement for us.
582,I want to second this. OP's wife is being petty. She suggests that he puts his hard earned reputation at risk to hire her fuck up of a brother and gives the silent treatment when OP (rightly) tells her no. When you add to the equation that OP was already nice enough to give this guy a chance and he blew it the only word I can use to sum up her behaviour is childish. Oh and the silent treatment is also childish. I think a long conversation needs to be had here to establish why she acts like this in situations that involves her brother. It sounds like she doesn't see his flaws at all and is determined to coddle him for the rest of his life.
583,"Medical school is very demanding. Apply yourself fully to school. In the infrequent times that you can relax and hang out with friends, you will be surprised at the number of women that would like to hang out with you and would be loyal in a relationship.

587,"**take a step back**

Your boyfriend has been with you for a year and a half, he loves you, you know he loves you and you sound like you do lovely coupley things together. His ex may be beautiful but if she was that great I'm pretty sure he would have tried going long distance with her. Looks really aren't everything and aren't enough to build a relationship on, plus I'm **100% sure you're being really hard on yourself and you are also a great looking girl, your boyfriend obviously thinks so**

Also you say you have no self confidence and you are unhappy with your weight, if this is serious why not try and get healthier - but you have to do this for you - no one else. Your boyfriend loves you just as you are already.

also? 

**Block his ex off of your facebook so you can't look her up**"

589,"&gt;Instead I think its time to get her parents involved.

I agree.  I think OP and her husband need to approach it carefully because Asshole Sister is still their daughter and they may get defensive, but I think the MIL is a potential ally here.  

I think it will work best if OP's husband goes to his mother (because I think she will hear it better coming from her son rather than her daughter-in-law) and takes the approach of, ""We love seeing family and we know [Baby] gets a real kick out of it too. But you've seen how Sister has acted towards us. If it was just a single comment here or there, I'd let it go, but she's constantly targeting us, and we've even caught her saying nasty things to the baby directly when she thought we weren't around. That's really the last straw for us. I don't want it to come to this, but [OP] and I are seriously considering just not attending the next few gatherings because we just can't be around that anymore.""

That's not an exact script, but basically, OP's husband should present himself as the super reasonable person who wants family harmony and regrets that it's come to this, but he has no choice since his baby's wellbeing is at stake. Since the mother already seems to understand her daughter is being a jerk, I don't think it's good to lean too hard on attacking her since that may just make MIL defensive.  Instead, taking the ""concerned father/husband"" approach is a reasonable and inarguable position.

Of course, if the MIL comes back with ""but you should just ignore it because faaaaaamily"" then OP and her husband have a whole new problem on their hands, but given MIL's willingness to ride herd on her daughter previously I think it's worth taking that chance."

591,Who exactly is the second?
592,"It may be tough for you to accept but it sounds like she's mentally checked out. She still cares about you but that doesn't mean she still loves you or wants to be with you. 

The best thing to do if you want to try and work something out is sit down with her and talk to her. See if she spills the beans on this supposed affair. See if she's willing to see a marriage counselor. "
593,"Being on your side in theory is not as good as showing their support through actions.  
My husband has an aunt and uncle that would treat me like absolute shit at family get togethers.  My response was to rarely show up because I didn't want his grandparents to choose between me and their own adult children.  It totally blew up in my face.  Now they just got into fights with my husband over me not being there (often I was working) and would try to tell him that I was cheating or that I didn't want kids with him or that I was just terrible and stupid.  
One holiday his grandfather approached me about it and everything came out in the open.  At first he had seen it as gentle teasing but I had to point out the problems like I did want children but were having trouble so telling my husband I just wasn't trying hard or cheating was killing our marriage.  I think Papa said something to them.  I show up at more holidays and they both avoid me now which I prefer.  "
594,"So before you had sex with the guy in the bathroom, and before you anticipated fondly your late nights with this guy, did it ever pass thru your mind what it would do to you if you cheated on Sol and also what it would do to Sol. Are you saying that the first time you thought about consequences is after you finished in the bathroom?  Your relationship with Sol sounds like it is over. But your can grow as a partner for your next guy by understanding when you should have had warning bells going off in your head and then reacting appropriately to those warnings. "
595,Holy narcissism Batman. You don't get to decide how he processes your infidelity.
596,"Try to take yourself from ""OMG SOMEONE IS SAYING SOMETHING WRONG I MUST FIX IT IMMEDIATELY"" to ""she is expressing something that I don't have personal experience with and that's OK."""

It sounds like he loves you very much and compromised because he knew that it would satisfy both of you better in the end. "
598,"I feel like this isn't just ""not having boundaries."" I think this kid is a fucking sexual predator. OP should check her room for cameras, put tape over her laptop/computer camera, put locks on all her doors, and check her phone for stuff too. This kid is sick."

Hot and understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead, shit on me, I don’t mind, I’m the Cool Girl.

If you dress inappropriately for functions we attend together, that makes me look bad and makes you look like you don't have respect for the function/people attending function. If your friends treat you like shit, as your loving partner, I want you to find better friends. None of this is controlling and just sounds like someone who wants their partner to improve themselves.  "
616,"To be fair, we don't know what size aunt wears, she could be a size 00 for all we know. I do worry that making exercising a miserable experience will make her hate it later in life too, making her weight problem worse. Plus as my mom has shown, exercising isn't everything. It takes so much to burn off a few calories, then one bit of junk food undoes it plus more. My mom rewards herself for walking a hour by eating ice cream she otherwise wouldn't eat. Cardio is important for health, you can be a bean pole and still have shit cholesterol, so she does need to be active but that probably wont help her weight as much as balanced diet will."
617,"Someone like this deserves only blow-up dolls, not real women."
618,"OP, I've been in a similar position.  My suggestion is pick one issue -- for me, it would be the insults to my mother -- and make that the place you draw the line.  Sure, listen to his boring stories, but when one of those stories insults your mother say something like ""Dad, I don't like hearing my mother insulted so I'm gonna call it a day.

I am projecting a bit here which is unfair. But she's not even attempting to do it at all and calling it hard, which is complete bullshit.
She's also choosing to work not because she needs to because she wants extra money for gas and clothes. "

YOU are worried about the idea of your friend engaging in a relationship with your boyfriend once he finds out that YOU went behind his back and fucked TWO GUYS at the same time. Can you read what you're saying? Your BOYFRIEND deserves better and honestly, I hope he does end up with your friend."

She's still going to go to his concerts and her friends are still going to be sleeping with his bandmates, etc.   I think in this case blocking her would just be adding fuel to the fire.  She would realize she was blocked and I have no doubt that she would then escalate things to the point of them having to involve the police and possibly court system.

633,"Stop being insecure. That's it.

Your girlfriend is probably better than you at other stuff too, and there's probably other stuff that you're better at. 

I know this is harsh, but as a woman I see this all the time. Men surprised I can lift more weight than them despite me saying I lift, or men surprised that I'm better at computers than they are, even though I work with computers. It fucking sucks, because this feeling is always based off of the fact that these men assume that they MUST be better than me because they LOVEEE computers so much more than I do, and for much longer, so how dare I be better. 

As a person, there are times when your girlfriend will be stronger than you, faster than you, funnier than you, and may even surprass you in a hobby because of a natural talent. If you're a good partner you will recognize that this is simple jealous and sexism and try to support your partner.  "

636,"No, if they gave him a job that pays a wage significantly higher than he could get on the open market, then he has cash that he wouldn't have absent her family's generosity.  It does not sound at all like she's asking him to cover all of her costs/expenses while in grad school, so I'm not sure where you're getting the ""afford to pay for another able adult"" from.  All she asked was how much she planned to contribute and then talked about, and his response, even though he'll be working as a nurse by then and not in school, seems to be ""nothing.""

There is no indication that once he's working as a nurse he would have to go into debt to simply contribute some to his girlfriend's expenses while in school.  

But upon being asked to do something that is entirely normal for an adult relationship, and despite having had financial assistance from her family, his response is ""no but I don't want to break up with her because then I won't have the well-paying job her family gave me.""  

And it's entirely healthy to ask your spouse if they'll contribute to your expenses while you're in grad school when you're adults and have been together for seven years.  "
637,"I broke my shoulder several years ago. It didn't affect my hands, but there were still things I couldn't do for a long time, including brushing my hair, reaching behind my back, or holding anything up for very long. Getting dressed was also difficult, since I couldn't reach bring my back or twist my arm in certain ways. 

On the one hand, it sounds like he's not pushing himself to be independent. On the other hand, shoulder injuries can take a long time to heal, and some of those things may still be hard for him. Playing video games involves very different movements than dressing yourself or bathing. It took me ages to be able to unscrew a jar, open door handles that were tight, or to wear certain clothes that weren't easy to slip on. 

I would already this by making it clear you're willing to help where he needs it, but that you're concerned that he isn't pushing himself to do things that are difficult for him, but which he could do with some effort. But keep in mind that, even if some things are better, there may still be things which are difficult. And even if he can work (which he just returned to a week ago!) doesn't mean he's fully recovered."
638,"&gt; He showed me a photo of his dad that he carries with him all the time and I can confirm it is, in fact, my father.

WRONG.

He showed you a photo of a man which he CLAIMED was his father, and he CLAIMS he carries it with him at all times, and it appears to be your father in the photo. He IMPLIED that the photo was genuine and not altered in some way. 

Facts are essential here. Stick to what you know is true. What you know is that a man approached you with a photograph and a story, nothing more. Nothing short of a DNA test will confirm anything beyond that. 

If Tom is sincere, and if he is understanding, then he would agree to a DNA test to prove his authenticity without hesitation. In fact, if he's actually eager to establish your relationship, he'd be offering to pay for it, after you set up the test through a clinic of your choosing.

Finally, don't feel like you owe Tom anything, even if he is your long-lost half-brother. This isn't the movies. Everyone has to make their own way. If his father walked out on him, it's not your fault. It has nothing to do with you at all. You owe him nothing. You don't even owe him the time to listen."

640,"You shouldn't bring this up at all. You could talk about Rebecca as somebody you remember fondly-although you were 7 when she died so i'm not sure you'll convince her it's just genuine interest.

But she is in her 70s. Either she was her girlfriend and is still hurt that people wouldn't acknowledge her relationship, or she really was just a friend and that's why nobody talks about their ""relationship"". If this was really a case of family disowning her for being a lesbian, they wouldn't attend the funeral, they wouldn't let her bring her along and she wouldn't even be anywhere near you. Plus, why would a 70 y.o discuss her love life with a 22 y.o relative? Are you THAT close? I'm just saying that even if she was straight and/or had multiple little affairs, she would never mention it to you."
641,"He's avoided not giving you this news, he's also avoided having a serious talk about your expectations about having kids with him, he's actively lied to you about plans through the next 6 months for your birthday, parents anniversary and summer, and I'm sure there's been dozens of other lies as well. He's even deliberately made sure you're NOT connected to your support network. This wasn't him making a decision to spare your feelings, this was him making a calculatedly CRUEL choice to abandon you.

This is a huge, huge betrayal. Honestly I feel like this is worse than actually cheating on you... the lengths he would need to go to in order to hide this from you, the deliberate lies and decisions he made to make sure you weren't connected to family readiness &amp; your own support networks, to ensure that this would be as traumatic and hurtful a blow as possible and leave you completely vulnerable and alone... the deliberate hateful meanness of it just boggles me.

This isn't someone who loves you and wanted to do the best thing for you, this is someone who hates you and wanted to really fuck you up. This was an actively nasty way to get you to leave him so that he can play ""abandoned by cruel wife while on deployment soldier boy"" in his future hook ups.

OP should have told her ex before having sex with him, at least that's my opinion.  Her ex has a right to decide he doesn't want to continue the relationship, which is what he's done.

What kind of man thinks his woman puts on lingerie for his birthday as a joke?

660,"It sounds like you guys aren't sexually compatible.

Sex can be extremely personal and I know a ton of people that would be uncomfortable with their partners going to these types of events. However, I also know a ton of people who would have a blast at these events. "
661,"In a sense yes. More like half lack of sense of retirement and half ""moral"" obligation. You are right that for new generations it's very hard, especially with the economy. People are delaying to have kids because they are expensive, let alone taking care of parents. Not to mention all sorts of debt. It's a vicious cycle in America.

Though back in China there is not such thing as debt. Just hard working farmer parents taking care of their kids, kids grow up and become farmers or strike it rich in manufacturing, then taking care of their parents. It's much simpler and easier to implement the idea of taking care of parents then here in US. 

It's a little struggle for me, but my brother and I at least work as a team. And fortunately my dad (who has passed away) bought a small townhouse within his means, so our payment is pretty low and we are still able to afford taking care of our mom. 

But when you have parents who spend a lot and don't live within their means, yet expect kids to pay, that's where I will cross the line. "

"
666,"I saw the aunt roll her eyes and walk upstairs saying ""i need a rest.""  She never specifically said anything about me.  There's a possibility my husband is just assuming that's why she went upstairs, and maybe she never actually said anything to him, but it seemed fairly obvious to me even before she said anything.  "
667,And have a third party present
668,"So my husband also has trouble picking up on stuff like this and often reads more than I mean into my offhand comments and the occasional minor annoyance on my part. The way this conversation would have gone with him and me is something like this:

Me: How come you don't ask for [thing he used to ask for] anymore?

Him: You seemed not to like it.

Me: Huh? How?

Him: [the description of actions that you, OP, gave above]

Me: Oh, I'm sorry, I was just teasing. I didn't realize that that's how that came across. I'll stop. Please do ask for [thing]; it makes me feel needed and I like it.

Him, probably with some doubt: Ok...

And ideally I will remember not to do the action that he was bothered by.

There are a few things you can do here: 

- Make sure you've told him directly about your difficulty with social cues (reiterate this to him while talking about this particular instance, if you haven't mentioned it recently), and point out that this is one of those times when said difficulty is causing a problem.

- You also need to tell him directly that the jokes and teasing made you feel like a burden, so he knows to stop doing it if he wants you to ask for help. Ask him not to tease you about things he likes you to do, because it's confusing and upsetting to you.

- Next time you think he might have an issue with something you're doing, ask him directly: ""[His specific behaviors that are making you wonder] make(s) me think that you don't like it when I [do this action]. Is that the case?"" Then the two of you can discuss it from there.

If he doesn't or won't understand that you need him to be direct, even if he's not good at it, then he might not be a good match for you.

You might also look into ""Love Languages"". It's a useful framework for figuring out what makes each partner feel loved. Sounds like his (or one of his) is ""acts of service"" -- he likes to do things for the people he loves. He may also like it when you do things for him. And you can find your own (there's a free quiz) so he can speak your ""love language"" (sorry, I can't not put it in quotes, the name seems silly to me) too."

672,"Yeah, maybe the girl who started speaking has some insecurity issue and thinks of OP as a competition. It's quite possible that the guy that stayed silent is already rethinking his choice of company and girlfriend. It's a shame nobody in the group was decent enough to call the others out on their shit. Maybe it happened after OP went away, but she can't really consider those people her friends now."

Like when camping or traveling abroad. "
674,Honestly I'd be pissed and would leave him. I know it's kind of crazy to be saying that but it costed you a job here on the path to a great career that I'm sure you want. It's petty high school behavior. This isn't your fault at all. He clearly doesn't support you and your career path. If he was feeling a way he should've used his words!
675,"Sabotage is not a ""boneheaded mistake"", it's premeditation.

He is manipulating your career for his own selfish reasons. A partner should be supportive. If he didn't like the job offer, he should have voiced his opinion like an adult, not embarrassed you like that."
676,"Thank you so much. I tried to make it so clear because I agree, that he won't realize the gravity of the situation until he's moving all of his things back home. I don't think he realizes how good he has it and I worry he will be regretful... but those will be his demons to face I suppose. "
677,"I've been in a pretty similar situation myself, just without having a new girl. Its hard. Its like, you couldn't give two fucks if she never spoke to you again, but you really don't want to hurt her. I don't know if this is the right answer, but here is what I said to her, more or less: 

Hey (person), I just wanted to clear something up. I may be getting mixed feelings, and it might be just me, so I hope this doesn't offend you. However, I feel like even though I can't and won't be anything more than friends, you aren't getting the idea, and keep trying to start something. I understand if those are your feelings, or if they aren't, but for whatever reason I think if the behaviour doesn't change, I'll have to make the choice to stop being your friend. I don't really know if I'm right, but I know how I feel is valid. If you want to stay friends, you have to stop flirting and trying to start things. This includes things like massages, and getting angry when we don't hang out completely alone (a big thing with my situation). Thank you for understanding. 

That's what I did. We slowly drifted apart after, but mostly due to me feeling free of her after she stopped her behaviour, and not because I ruined a friendship. "
678,"Surely the burden of proof is on the guy who wants to move to a different continent, rather than the one who wants to stay put? It's not like choosing between two houses to buy, he hasn't given a particular reason why they have to go anywhere at all. "

683,"Wait a second... Putting aside the sports bra nonsense (which is absolutely nonsense), your husband was only let go from his job last month, you say? So he's been out of work for a month or less, and you say that has caused his depression? That implies that he's been ""depressed"" for a mere matter of weeks, and he's already gone to the GP, who immediately put him on antidepressants? This concerns me, and it should concern you too.

Don't get me wrong, antidepressants do a lot of good for a lot of people, but their use is also not a step to be taken lightly. He's only been ""depressed"" for a few weeks! Why jump to medication so quickly? How bad was the depression? Was it very severe? Was he having suicidal thoughts? Because choosing to medicate someone who's only been 'depressed' for a few weeks because he lost his job (something that would put anyone down in the dumps for a while) seems like a rash and hasty decision to me.

Are you absolute sure he's depressed, and not just experiencing the normal amount of sadness anyone would feel after been let go from their job?"

I have had two deep cycles of depression since the diagnosis and she has become a pro and dealing with it.  
 
We have established these guidelines: 

1.  Assume positive intentions.  We always assume the other is doing or saying whatever they are saying out of love.  

2.  Do not expect people to be what they have never been.  Put another way, if someone has always acted like (X) then why are you angry that they did (x)?  

You have been together for around 15 years?  In that time you have gone from young high school students to married professionals with advanced degrees.  That is a great deal of change over the course of your time together.  Have you sat down and thought about who you were vs who you are now?  Have the two of you talked about it?  Have you set up basic ground rules for reaching understandings about money?  How you deal with what you have? Do you have a plan for dealing with the next cycle of depression?  I know, lots of questions.  But communication heads of misunderstanding and that's a good thing.  Talk about what's eating away and you.  I have said this before on this sub, love is a powerful force for healing.  Keep that in mind as you work though this.

And sure, he can't afford to pay you back right now, but he can start. How about he sell some of his stuff.

He doesn't need to go out for lunch when he can have baked beans on toast... "

I've done the same hyper-aware criticism of my own behaviour. I was seeing a psychologist at that point and he told me that could be a problem: I'm so focussed on looking at and criticising my own behaviour that I'm not making connections and focusing on the other people.
I mean, unlike you, I have a pretty good idea what my problems are and I don't care enough to really address them. I'm stand offish, in that I'm physically distant (I hate the whole friendly hug/kiss thing). I struggle with eye contact. I don't laugh easily. I don't initiate or pursue friendships enough. I have a deep fear of prying which can translate to not asking people enough about themselves. God, no wonder I don't have friends! Lol
I was in a mother's group when my eldest was a baby. There were about 10 of us. We met up weekly, went out for dinner occasionally, etc. We kept that up for about 3 years. After that, things drifted. A couple moved away or were too busy to maintain contact. 4 had formed a really close bond and seemed to suddenly be doing all this stuff without the rest of us. And then, 4 of us were kinda left as unwanted nobodies. We've kept up with each other a bit, and one lives around the corner from me and our daughters are good friends and we catch up fairly often. Another is one of those frustrating 'yes let's catch up oh wait I'm busy oh it's been too long definitely next week oh wait I'll let you know'. And the other doesn't seem interested in the rest.
Suffice to say, even after knowing these women for over 4 years, and spending a huge amount of time with them, I've not formed an emotionally intimate friendships with any of them. My kids have a play date lined up with the one round the corner tomorrow, and the mum and I will chat, but still... I know I should, like, initiate some kind of friendship activity or something, but I just can't do it.
And I've got another play date in an hour, with a kindergarten mum. Trying not to feel defeatist already...
Probably my best friendship is with an old workmate who has a kid the same age as my youngest and I've only seen in person once since we stopped working together. Hooray for Facebook messenger.
All this babbling just to say: I sympathise, I really do. If I lived near you I'm sure I could be your friend :) once we got over my initial offputting awkwardness of course :D"
700,A mistake made at 17 years old doesn't make him undeserving of a chance at love. 90 days isn't much but how is that number supposed to increase? Let her do what she wants without your judgement.
701,This is such a fantastic way of responding to this situation. Very diplomatic. I'm so impressed with the wording! 
702,"What the fuck is this shit?  No, dude. No mulligans for domestic violence. Jesus Christ. "
703,"You need to move on. Let go. I stayed. He kept giving excuses to put off trying for a baby. I resent it every. single. day. It will ultimately end us, I can't get over it, even with therapy.

You though. You are young! You have time to heal. To find someone else. To have the family you always wanted. You can do this :) Get out and move on ASAP. Good luck!"
704,"While I agree in general, in this case his willingness to enter therapy warrants him a second chance. I heard terrible things from my mom to my dad growing up, but my reaction was to make sure I never said those things to my eventual wife. I've made good on that. He sounds like he's serious about doing the same, he just might turn things around."
705,"&gt; I didn't care to. 


fucking start caring"
706,Will do.
707,"Yikes, this isn't normal at all. 

I strongly advise you to consider what everyone else has said in this thread. Chances are she is probably hiding it in purpose because she loves the attention. That may mean she finds it fun to be flirted with, or it could unfortunately mean something more serious. However...

Speaking as a girl with anxiety, I can kind of understand where she's coming from so I'll try to speak from that perspective. Though for me personally it's not so much a fear about guys getting angry, just a fear of ruining potential friendships and trying to avoid being ""that girl"" who immediately shuts down a guy who is just trying to be genuinely nice and isn't necessarily looking for a relationship.

My solution to this ""issue?"" Always bringing up my boyfriend pretty early on into a conversation when getting to know someone, and in the most casual way possible. I look for every opportunity to mention him when meeting a potential new friend (and how could I not? we're pretty big parts of each other's identity at this point in the relationship). For example:

Guy: ""So what do you like to do for fun?""

Me: ""(lists hobbies), and I also like to go to movies and concerts a lot with my boyfriend.""

Or

Guy: ""What made you decide to come to this area?""

Me: ""I mostly moved here to be closer to my boyfriend, since we had to do long distance for a pretty long time.""

And so on. If she's genuinely worried about guys getting mad and is not covering something up here, bringing it up in a casual manner like this would ease a lot of the tension. If there is any tension at all to be had, that is. If it really is her anxiety speaking here, anxiety causes one to have a lot of irrational thoughts that they can't always control. However, a person with anxiety should always learn to control the actions that result from those thoughts. The supposed fallout of telling these guys she has a boyfriend would not as bad as she expects, and as your girlfriend, she needs to speak up and be responsible for telling them.

Finally, make sure you have an honest conversation about how you feel. There was an incident several months back when my bf thought I might be up to something because I made a few close guy friends at university and he hadn't had the chance to meet them since he lives in a different city. It just about broke me, knowing I'd given him any reason to worry :( if she cares about you, she will listen and try to do things better. If she doesn't make an effort to speak up to these guys about you and you no longer feel you can trust her, it might be time to reconsider some things."
708,"Every rule will have an exception. I agree that some May-December relationships can work out great. However, that is a small minority where the large differences in life experience and what is generally happening at particular ages doesn't fuck it up. Intent is indeed the decider, and the woman we are currently discussing seems to tick the 'dodgy' box quite well."

710,"You can't. Leave him alone forever and find someone else who actually wants to date you. 

&gt;How can I resolve this?

Choose to move on. Block his social media. Focus on everything in your life that is not him. Do NOT contact him or bother his ex. 

&gt;I can’t understand what happened.

What happened is that someone you were interested in turned out not to be very interested in you beyond sex. Happens all the time. Nothing weird or difficult to understand about it.

It sucks, but unless you want to go into deranged territory, the only thing to do is accept it and move on."
711,"&gt; Sure, but there's no health recommendation that you do.

There is for basic health. They don't offer a cheap test for funsies. They do so because they realize they can't know for sure off a 5 minute question asking session. 

The CDC still recommends HIV testing from puberty to old age, and  says nothing about not testing people. You can't accurately determine a patient's risk factor from their age alone, or their martial status. A risk factor for having an STD is literally being sexually active.

You can be a virgin at 40 and get an STD your first time having sex. 

Basic health measures should be encouraged, not rallied against pointlessly because you have some reason decided it. And getting and STD test when offered one is so simple and cheap. 

"
712,"In this day in age it's best to file reports. This girl could claim he was the one to hit first. I understand that this sounds extreme but I would proceed with caution, I'd want my ass covered.

714,"Physical intimacy needs are legitimate (including the need for sex) and sexual incompatibility is a legitimate dealbreaker for relationships. You aren't a bad person for having a high libido and your gf isn't a bad person for having a low libido. But, it does sound like you two are sexually incompatible and honestly, that's just something you can't fix. Not getting your physical intimacy needs met is a legitimate reason to end a relationship and I don't think things will change between you and this girl (if anything, they'll only get worse). "
715,"He could indeed, but that would be a *completely* different operation from the tube snip he planned."
716,OP has a relationship with an intelligent human being who isn't afraid to speak their mind. That's very normal these days. I'd say what's more abnormal would be the 30 year old man children who expect this woman not to call them out on their teen-esque bullshit. Why is it always feminism this feminism that?

724,"You are pretty much completely wrong here.

1) Be responsible and take your car to a shop instead of blowing off responsibilities and throwing a fit when your boyfriend is reasonably concerned. If someone I cared about had blown enough a real safety concern for weeks, I would be upset. 

2) You immaturely lashed out over how he speaks instead of taking responsibility and just taking your car in like an adult. 

You are generally incredibly immature and prone to lashing out for no real reason at all? I would sit him down, apologize for the entire fight, and apologize for lashing out. And then never repeat this baffling behavior again. "

These guys also did not bother introducing the temporary girlfriends to their family."
733,"Your BF is enmeshed with his family(mommy).

He needs to move out and get into therapy.

You need to break-up and find someone who is both willing and able to have a relationship."
734,"That's something completely unanswerable given the amount of knowledge OP has given us.  ""Intersex"" covers everything from conditions that effect the reproductive organs to primarily cosmetic differences such as an abnormally large clitoris.  

edit: If it's a cosmetic difference, all it means is that the genitalia formed in a somewhat ambiguous way (clitoris large enough to appear to be a tiny penis, labia that are partially fused, etc.) but it does not necessarily mean that the person had actual additional genitalia (functional or otherwise).  "
735,"&gt; He also keeps saying he is glad he stayed faithful during the trip, without me mentioning anything.

Yeah...that's a pretty clear sign that something did happen that he's trying to convince himself wasn't ""cheating,"" but that he knows in his heart you would consider cheating.

You've been together less than a year. It's too early in your relationship (and life, imho) to be considering marriage. And recognize that marriage does not fix issues in your relationship -- I mean, the guy didn't even invite you to join him as his +1."
736,"As someone who has a brother with similar special needs, raising a special needs child is A LOT harder than raising a regular child. Like... not even comparable. They require extensive care *decades* past what a regular child will need. It's a constantly stressful and anxious situation for a parent to be in.

I agree with the other poster that it sounds like she is just fearful of what will happen to her son if she passes."
737,"Since we're all overreacting, I think OP should also cancel the wedding since her fiancé is friends with Joe at all. Also consider calling said women's employer to be sure they know of the infidelity. "
738,"That's normal, but why is he showing it to her? Unless he has a specific kink (which boobs and vaginas aren't) it's odd to me that he's sharing his personal porn stash.

OP, what was his reason for showing you this?"
739,"Maybe jumping into an extended trip isn't the way to go about this, especially if she feels like she doesn't get enough time with the baby. Have you been able to get briefer time alone with one another as a compromise, before separating her from her very new baby so soon?

Past that, and this will be a common suggestion, is continued couple's counseling. Neither of you is necessarily wrong in this case, but your priorities being so far out of whack neither of you seem to ""get"" what's important to the other.  "
740,"Shit like this boggles my mind... 

First off, I wouldn't worry so much about your situation. I would try talking to your professor in person (since you know him fairly well) and explain the whole situation. It's not your job or problem to give this guy a ride every time just because he is an ""international"" student, or doesn't have a vehicle. Don't give in.

&gt; Am I overacting here?

Secondly, I think you have been more than concerning and helpful to him. No, you are not overacting. Why can't he ask someone else? Why can't he figure out his own means of transportation? I would be just as upset as you right now (maybe more). Talk with your professor when you get the time and explain your situation. If you can, I would just avoid any interaction with this guy for the rest of the semester. "

744,"Um, 7 years is not the same as 22 years. There is a huge double standard where it's okay for men to date younger women, but it's weird when the woman is older than the man. Could you just tell your family members to please stop joking about the age difference?"
745,"1) none of that is consent. 
2) seriously, who starts with sticking their hand in someone's panties. "
746,"Yeah and it's not like you can change your passwords ever again...wait a minute.

He could change his passwords and PIN so no one would know his new ones. 

Why didn't he just say he would order for you on his break?

Rather then be reassured that his fears were NOT real, he wanted to yell at you. 

And it's largely unfounded, because he was willing to give you a card worth thousands of dollars anyway. So he actually does trust you.

OP's BF, truly examine yourself. This misperception and anger is not good for OP or you."
747,"&gt; She also doesn't want to be with me anymore.

Ok

&gt; There's no way I can give up on her. 

Not ok. "
748,"It does sound like you're jealous. I went through something sort of similar when my sister broke up with her BF when we were in high school. *15 minutes* after posting about the break up and she already had two or three guys asking her out to ""talk about it"". She also was able to get random guys to do favors for her quite easily. 
Now that we're both older it doesn't bother me anymore. We like to hang out in different crowds, we've always been different people, and we've always been interested in different types of guys. As I've gotten older I was always able to meet guys in my circle ok, and I've realized that a lot of those guys probably weren't great people anyways if they're that desperate and willing to come around immediately after a breakup like that.

I'd say stay out of it with your friend unless one of these dudes seriously crosses the line and you are worried for her safety, or if she is bringing weird guys over at odd times and they make you uncomfortable. Other than that just let her do her thing and focus on your own love life instead of hers. 

"
749,"I mean as an American it's hard to explain what makes me want to stay in America too. Although I think it's mostly the fact that moving countries is really hard and stressful and expensive.

If it's true that she can't handle it or that's she's so high maintenance, they shouldn't have kids and they are not the right match because she needs someone who is around more.

If it's not true, she shouldn't want kids with someone who has so little faith in her.

OP sounds like she's clear headed and capable of handling it just fine. I'm leaning toward #3.

Edit: fixed some humongous text."
752,Hell yeah. The kids are grown. His work is done and this woman is out of his life. 
753,"Agreed.  Talk is cheap, if these people were in the same situation, doubtful they would act differently than OP.  Ex-wife decided to go her own way. Well, she's on her own now, exactly as she wanted."
754,"The fact that you couldnt work out that ""masturbating face to face with strangers"" was cheating without someone telling you is the reason no-one would trust you going forward.

I mean its self evident!  Would you masturbate in the same room, locked eye to eye, with another guy?  Then how does an extra piece of glass between you change anything?"
755,"Finding a babysitter for these children will be *no* simple task.

Both these children are vulnerable and they would have to find a babysitter who is not only *qualified* to look after an autistic child but also one they know well enough to trust. They simply may not know anyone who fits that description and may not want to take the risk understandably.

The wedding may be your day but this is their life and I think you need to respect that."

Oooof. That is pretty damn rough. How's the rest of your relationship? Is there fun, happiness, romance, intimacy? You've painted a bleak picture, and most other posts include a see-through ""but the rest of our relationship is great"" disclaimer - but you haven't. 


She sounds a bad communicator who doesn't know what she wants/feels, and makes up for it by inventing problems within you. Maybe she doesn't like being around you. 


How much have you talked to her about what it feels like to be an introvert? My SO is a crazy extrovert, and it took a while for him to learn that toning down the socialising was necessary for me to be happy and sane, and therefore our relationship to feel happy and balanced. "

765,"Give yourself more free time by leaving him.

Look, this sub jumps to breaking up way too often. But based on this behavior, which doesn't sound like a one time flare-up, I don't think that I'd continue with a relationship that ended up being so one-sided.

I'm the student in my relationship while we both work full time, and while I sometimes wish my husband was more supportive in certain ways (like housework), my husband knows that my schooling will be for both of our benefit. And right now I have Thursdays off from work so that I can take a class; when his bossed asked him what day he wanted off, he specifically chose Thursdays so we could spend more time together. He didn't whine about having to cater to my schedule. When you're in a relationship, you don't always get to have things just the way you want them 100% of the time, and I think it's weird that he wouldn't want to ever change his schedule around for you. "

Also finishing at age 28 is not a big deal. Lots of people do it. I'll finish a month before I turn 30. So what?

Happens with proposal posts, too. ""I don't see why you need marriage, it's just a piece of paper!"" O...kay? But she wants to be married, and that's valid.

I agree with you here, too: she wants children in her 20's, preferably within the year. That's valid. The problem is not whether she should wait for her ""travel plans"" (which don't sound set in stone, and I think that's alarming, but I digress), but that OP is not on the same page with his wife... and how many posts here and IRL go this way, then poof! she wakes up childless at 36 and now it *is* too late, either with him or with someone else.

You should also let him know that you guys aren't together as of now, so he can be honest about seeing other people because it affects you. If he's having sex with other people at the same time as you, you should be worried about your own sexual health - both of you should go get checked.

But this approach hasn't been so easy lately - I guess I'm getting annoyed and I think my supervisor is catching on that I'm not as keen about these projects any more.

On some level, going ""scorched earth"" and reporting him would be great and I feel like I do have some obligation to do that. But doing so just-because seems like impulsive career suicide, though it would definitely be something I'd carefully consider in the future once my career and living situation is more stable. Right now my residency status is job dependent, and my current advisor and him are long-time collaborators so I'm not too keen on making any waves in the short-term. 

Lawyering up was something I didn't think of - thanks! I don't have many resources now, but I'll ask around and should definitely get their opinion if I do decide to take action down the road."
794,"And it's not like she did anything morally wrong. I hate how it's viewed as completely normal for men to use pornography, but people act like the women who appear in porn are witches or something. "
795,"This is a very special day for her and I agree with her that your excuses aren't really that great. I do understand not wanting to be uncomfortable but I mean come on, its her wedding day. She obviously wants you there for support. I feel like you're just being petty about this and there really is no reason not to go. "
796,"I really am taking your advice to heart. And again, I'm super grateful that you've taken the time to reply. 

Just throwing this out there, I asked her if anyone was planning a ""black balloon party"" she told me ""they better fucking not be, or I'll kill them."" And yes, she has told me before that she would be mortified by a surprise of party.

My mom also expressed concern about this event since she feels it doesn't align with my sister's personality. She even said, ""at least she can't blame me."" (My mom is aware that she often rubs my sister the wrong way, it's not exactly a secret.)

But, mom says chill out and stay out of it. And since y'all seem to agree, I'll hope for the best. I hope she has a blast. And I'll hope someone makes sure she has some inkling that it's going to happen. If nothing else, she'll know that she's special and loved and that's all that matters."
797,"Yeah, that age gap is rough. I guess a good way to think about it is: if these were your nieces and not your sisters, what level of desire would you have to get to know them? 

Also, while there isn't much benefit to you - there is a huge benefit to them. I don't know what your mom's side of the family looks like, but it could really benefit them to have another adult in their lives. Yeah, you're not going to be the super relatable older sibling who won't tell mom and dad when you catch them sneaking out, but if they need a trusted adult - they'd have you. And if something happens to your mom, they'll especially need you. Yeah, you're going to be 35+ when the youngest is 18 but your mom is going to be 60+. "
798,"Wow.  Just...wow.  If I were you I would put any wedding planning on hold and book in with a premarital counselor immediately.  Insist he attend with you and hash this out completely.  He wasn't just insecure, he failed to communicate and deliberately sabotaged you!  Plus, he went the ENTIRE DAY, knowing what was coming later, knowing how embarrassed you would be, knowing how horrible you would feel.  That's just...so incredibly low."
799,"OP has posted an update... She was talking about the film.

Well... that was an anticlimax."
800,"Yeah if I was him and I was waiting for the right time, I would be incredibly disappointed if my plan was co opted."

802,"I did the same with my boyfriend a while ago. I was using his computer and had the idea of going throw his browser history. I find out the he was on dating websites and was having chats and hitting on like 10 or 15 girls. I never told him and I didn't break up, but it broke my heart. For the longest time I was upset with him, and obviously he didn't understand why. A few months later we broke up and even though we have slept together again several time since the break up (2 years ago now) and even though I still like him I would never be able to trust him. It's the same with you and your girlfriend. It's fucked up because I'm sure you still love her, but you know you can't trust her and there's no way a relationship can last without trust. Good luck :) "
803,"According to OP's post, his brother in law has done work for him before. However, he had proven himself to be a lazy brat... 

Don't budge on this. MAYBE give him an interview at most, but definitely not a job that he thinks is beneath him."
804,"&gt; We understand the sanctity of marriage and we both hold that belief. Marriage is a lifetime commitment. 

So, what, she's getting all her cheating out of the way now, before it ""counts""?

Come on, she has NO belief in the sanctituy of marriage
"
805,"Most women wouldn't fuck their gay male friend, either."
806,"As someone who takes multiple xanax a day and drinks regularly, I'm uncomfortable with the certitude of your statement about OP's sister's cause of death. Everyone's body reacts differently to mixing medications and alcohol. And we only have a small picture of the sister's known medical history/issues. We're here to give relationship advice, not play computer pathologist."
807,"Well honey that's not ok. I don't have much advice because it sounds like you've tried a lot already and he isn't making the effort. If you're looking for permission to separate and evaluate the relationship because he isn't trying hard enough, consider it granted. "
808,"&gt; The fact that even you are not comfortable revealing what her meals are is what concerns me the most here. What could possibly be the reason for not wanting to say what she eats if there's nothing wrong with it? Maybe I'm crazy but I can't think of any good reason here.

If her approved foods list is unique enough, it could be enough to identify who the OP is in real life. That's probably why he doesn't want to say what it is."

810,Try posting over on r/sexover30. People are there are generally a little more experienced with issues related to sex within a relationship and are generally a tad more insightful than the responses you might find on r/sex. 
811,"Break up. Even if this was all the depression (spoilers: it wasn't), his illness is his responsibility. If he can't manage it properly, that's on him, not you."
812,"This is genius, and exactly what OP should do. 

Reseal it and pretend like they never saw the letter, and deliver it as promised.

How Stepmom reacts is her own deal, but considering the extent of the abuse, she'll most likely lie and talk about how nice and glowing the letter was from her long lost son."
813,"&gt;  Usually in a friendship among opposite genders there is attraction on at least one of the sides

Are you 12 and not 19? Newsflash, people can have friends of the opposite genders and not be attracted to them. Most adults have friends of both genders. That doesn't mean they are out cheating on their SO just because they are friends.

&gt;I don't consider myself controlling, nor having any self esteem/insecurity issues.

You are controlling and you obviously have insecurity issues. 

&gt;I find it disrespectful to me for her to get close with another man

And your worldview is very 'women in the kitchen'. 

She can have friends of any gender and any age. You making demands on who is she and is not friends with is insanely controlling. "
814,"In Michigan it's 26 for a young adult post high school program.

Most states have support coverage till the age of 26"
815,"Sorry to hear of your loss. 

I know it's not quite the same but it was my BF's Grandads funeral recently. At the wake, I walked outside and he was hugging a girl that we both know but I don't particularly like . They broke apart when I saw them. My first thought was, why couldn't they hug inside? It felt sneaky. But, he was an emotional wreck that day and even if she had some agenda, I had to trust that it was nothing more than a friendly hug on a day that he needed it more than ever. So, I forgot about it.

What I'm trying to say is, even if she has some agenda, it's your boyfriend you need to watch. If he starts to show signs of reciprocating her interests or seeking comfort from her instead of you then maybe worry. Otherwise try to forget about her and take care of each other in these hard times.

818,"Seriously...this is a massive thing to ask your significant other no matter how long you've been together, but for a relationship of less than six months?? Heck nah."
819,"A red flag doesn't mean ""he's a terrible person"" it means ""this is a concerning thing""

It is concerning that he doesn't want her to see a counselor. Maybe he has a flawed but understandable reason for it but that doesn't mean it isn't concerning."

821,"This isn't just a mistake though. She was openly flirting and touching another man at a party while completely ignoring her fiance. Celebrity or not, she crossed a line and it's hard to move on from that. "
822,"And at that age, it would be easy to miss a milestone like first steps."
823,I'm also childfree but I think SIL is taking it too far. There is being mildly annoyed at seeing your family not accepting your views on children and there is borderline antagonising the family and baby with said views. There must be more going on with SIL than we know because it's not normal behaviour 
824,"Focusing on his plan, what's the best case scenario in which he has a gun? Shooting at a police officer. 

Ignoring the fact he threatened to kill you (even if said as a joke) **he's actively planning to draw a weapon if he's stopped by the police**. Does that sound smart? Does that sound like a plan that could possibly end with him walking out alive? Not to mention that if he draws a gun on someone while you're nearby you're very likely to get caught in the firing line. "
825,"Oh fuck, you are so lucky you didn't go with ""squishy."" I don't know how you'd come back from that one. I'm sure it'll be fine, girls are pretty aware of the fact most guys suck at talking."
826,"It's interesting that you're worried about her feeling blindsided. 

I mean,  didn't you feel blindsided by her actions?

You should not concern yourself with her feelings whatsoever. 

She needs to learn,  the hard way,  what it means to work in a professional environment. 

Actions have consequences,  you did everything right. "
827,"&gt;Wow, is he ever going to be embarassed when you post that on the Internet...

Especially if OP forgets to use a throwaway..."
828,"I believe it's quid* pro quo. No judgement here, just hoping I can save you some trouble/embarrassment in the future :) "
829,Because you are ten years younger?!
830,"Of course it is, this is /r/relationships.

Almost every single post can be answered in one of these ways:

- ""You need to speak to (partner/friend/family member) directly and outline this issue for them exactly the way you've done for us""
- ""Dump the person who is abusing you/treating you like crap/ignoring you/withholding X as a form of punishment/etc.""
- ""You and/or your partner need to stop being co-dependent and discover other hobbies/friends/things to do apart from each other""

Rinse and repeat. This post is the third one. "
831,A bit quick to worry this will be your new future.  If it really persists a week maybe its a problem.  Like the thought of having sex with my wife seemed cruel with her ear infection last night.  
832,"That was the most uppity, holier than than thou email I have ever read. Holy crap. Was he wrong to ""kick your pouf"" and call you a bitch? Sure. I don't think anything bordering on violence is acceptable. But that absolutely does not make him the horrible person that you have tried to make him feel like he is.

You antagonized him after he asked you to stop and then you were surprised when he snapped at you. You then wrote him a nasty, demeaning, threatening email that showed absolutely no self-awareness or remorse of your own. If I were him, I'd take your huge over-reaction and blindness to your own mistakes as reason to GTFO of this relationship.

I think you should apologize. For how you treated him before the incident and the email that you wrote to him after. Then give him a chance to apologize to you for the way he acted.

You can both be a little bit right and a little bit wrong."
833,"Twitter isn't really the real problem here though, is it?

He isn't listening to you or respecting your point of view."
834,You seem a little too heavily invested in your friends opinion and a pact you made when you were 13.  You and your circumstances have changed so much since then.  You did what you thought was right don't regret your decision.  If she can't be happy for you and supportive then who needs her?
835,"&gt; And she also avoids all issues in life by pretending they don't exist. 

I think this is actually the biggest reason to not date her."
836,"&gt;But why would he tell me what he has done if he isn't serious about it being in the past?

Because people believe the first version of a story they hear and he wanted to make sure you got the version that makes him look better.

&gt; His brother just wasn't used to seeing him get so angry

You know this is an admission that it happened, right? 

"
837,"This. He's hurt, OP, you basically told him he wasn't very good at giving you pleasure and that you using toys on yourself does a better job. That doesn't exactly help his confidence.

You're going to have to give him time to cool down, and then maybe explain what he's good at, and ways that he could improve. Something more subtle than what you said before."
838,But he's also totally honest when Gram is inexplicably right about something! Alton is my fave.
839,My husband is a third. It's maddening in 100 different ways. 
840,Do you hang out when her friends are around or does she want you to leave as soon as they show up?
841,"He woke up, told her he was leaving, and she opted to go back to bed. If she wanted to say goodbye, she could have said goodbye. I mean ""I'm leaving to do xyz now"" is a pretty huge tip-off that someone is leaving for the day. Why should he apologise because he didn't wake her back up and say goodbye?"
842,Did you read the post? Maya is half chinese half white and tyler is half latino half white 
843,"&gt;  Close friend of mine who I had been having a very serious non-titled relationship with has said to his mum that we are no longer speaking and I feel like a fool and am not sure how to go about it

No offense, but from what you've written, your conclusion of a ""very serious"" relationship is just... wrong. You were fucking him for a year..... that's about it. It sounds like you're putting a ton of energy and thought into something he just doesn't care that much about.


There's no such thing as a ""non-titled"" but somehow ""serious"" relationship where you just had sex and he won't tell his mom he's with you."
844,"I'd want to know ahead of time so I could cherish the time we had. Imagine they had a fight right before he passed away and then she had to live with the guilt of fighting not knowing he could die at any time, and worrying he thought she didn't care. "
