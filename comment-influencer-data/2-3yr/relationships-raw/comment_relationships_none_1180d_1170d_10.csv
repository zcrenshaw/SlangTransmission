0,Call the police. Tell them that you need to go your ex-girlfriend's house to pick up your stuff and she is refusing to give it back. They will provide an escort. Happens all the time.
1,"I think OP is saying anyone that deliberately breeds a dog like this is an irresponsible asshat, but sometimes farmers' dogs are impregnanted by coyotes without the farmer setting up a date for them.

"
2,"Thank you. I will try to keep it together until my first therapy appointment in late august. I have deleted his number and any remnants of him but yes, it will be a long road to recovery and loving myself again."
3,"In my message to her before I realised she was asleep I said ""You said you wouldn't tell anyone! Then you told ___ AND dad and ___, dad I can handle, ___ is your best friend I can understand- but this hurts me so much mum. I am so angry- I told you in confidence that you would wait till 12 weeks and you said you would. She just messaged me to congratulate me and I didn't even know she knew. 
Do you know how that feels? I had to tell a woman I hardly know, or am still getting used to that I've lost my baby. Please do NOT share that information with anyone again. Who else have you told?"""
4,"There's a difference between kids hitting each other and being overpowered and beaten. Siblings hit each other in the arm, not in the face. Siblings don't knee each other in the stomach when one of them does the right thing. You don't get over being *overpowered* by a sibling very quickly, especially if they are old enough to know better, and 16 is old enough to know better.

I was overpowered once, just once, by my older brother. He didn't even really hurt me, just showed me he was stronger because I happened to be walking past him in a narrow hallway and accidentally knocked his shoulder. That happened almost 15 years ago when we were in middle school or so, but I haven't forgotten. 

I don't know if maybe you aren't female? Women are almost always weaker than men, and being shown that on purpose isn't something you forget. And using that strength to hurt someone you are supposed to love because you didn't like facing just consequences isn't something that is forgiven. It doesn't matter whether you are a child or an adult, excessive force is wrong."
5,"It's incredibly fucked up that instead of just asking you out, he devised this plan where you get hurt, Jay gets hurt, and he rides up on horseback to save the damsel in distress.

You and Jay both need to cut contact. It is so unhealthy that he ENCOURAGED you two to date with the hopes that you'd break up. Seriously, what kind of person thinks that way?"
6,"At the moment a pervy step brother entering her room is much more likely than a fire, I'd say. "
7,"Dump him.

He stranded you at Walmart as a power play to prevent you from doing what you want. When you were able to bewith your friends, he was furious. For no good reason. This guy is trying to isolate you.

You should be furious at him for just abandoning you. 

Also, sometimes when people suspect their partners are cheating (but they're really not), it's because the accuser is cheating themselves and they're projecting their feelings on the innocent partner. Just some food for thought in case he has other suspicious behaviours you didn't mention. "
8,Child support is separate from custody. You should really see if you can speak with a lawyer and find out what your options are.
9,"She didn't meet you 4 days ago and then find out she needed a place to stay. She needed a place to stay and went online to find one.

It's ridiculous you're considering spending $400/week on a girl you met 4 days ago simply because she doesn't want to. Those are prostitute standards, and she's not guaranteeing you anything."
10,"My dad carried on multiple affairs, so you could say he was a horrible husband and an ass in that regard.

He was an *amazing* dad. I was his stepkid but he never made me felt less than my sister, watched us anytime my mom went out, always doing things with us, and spent time with us even though he worked crazy hours. He even called my paternal (bio father) grandparent's house once in awhile to check on them and see if they needed anything. I could not have asked for a better dad."
11,"OP this is more than just drama. This is a potentially dangerous situation. It stopped being ""drama"" when he started waiting for your coworker when he wasn't even fucking working then. You mentioned in a previous post that

&gt;One of the reasons I stayed late is that I honestly felt like leaving her and him alone wouldn't end well. He was just so disturbing.

The fact that you wrote this means you know this is more than drama and that it can escalate into something very bad. Even if they say ""yeah... and?"" , which if you relay ALL of the info you told us and anything else along with the girl in question making statement they will likely not, they at least know that if the girl goes missing or if more warning signs appear where to take action and you will have tried."
12,"On top of this, the reasonable response when your partner says ""I never get pictures of myself when I bring it along"" is, ""Well, OP, what if I agreed to use it on several days, and we both made sure that you were in many pictures every day? I want pictures of *you* from this vacation, too."""
13,"OH, also:

&gt;I was thinking of just texting him to say its really over because I don’t think I’m brave enough to tell him in person but I think that might prove his point about me being immature. 

Do not break up with him in person. There is _nothing_ ""immature"" about keeping yourself safe. He's dangerous to be around. You should not meet him again."
14,"Yeah, that doesn't change the fact that you were a complete jerk to her while you were married, and she's going to see your proposal to the GF you spoil as you rubbing it in her face.

How thick are you, seriously?"
15,"I don't think that they don't care, I think they don't understand the severity of OP's injury. I would go up to them again, get your Mom's attention, and me like, ""Mom, I need you listen to me. There's something seriously wrong with my leg. I need to go to urgent care. Now."" If she again brushes it off then I would talk to one of your friend's parents and ask them to take you to urgent care as soon as possible "
16,"I know that I have to cut ties with her, but I'm asking for advice in how to cope with her while we have to talk. Job offer is really low (to be honest, it is pretty non-existent. It is a really small town) and even though I'm already looking for one (without her knowledge), I am not finding anything. In the mean time I have to talk with her or I will be fired."
17,"If she's evading going to the shelter, this combined with a virtually impossible idea makes me think she doesn't actually want you to propose right now."
18,"I think if I was your boyfriend I would feel threatened by what you're doing.  It seems really weird that you'd go so far out of your way for someone you only describe as a ""new coworker"".  Frankly, it sounds kinda like the beginning of a love story. 

Guy meets girl.  Guy needs help.  Girl who doesn't have any reason to starts spending tons of time with guy.  Girl continues spending tons of time with guy even when he doesn't need help anymore.  Next part of the story: Girl has a fight with her boyfriend, runs to Guy for solace.  Girl realizes she has feelings for Guy.  And of course the audience can see that girl liked guy the whole time, she just didn't recognize it.

Maybe that's really not what's going on.  But how can your boyfriend see that?  It's not a bad thing that you've asked your boyfriend to come along, but I think what your boyfriend really needs right now is for you to start placing your relationship with him first again.  Back off.  You can be friends with this guy if that's what you want but since you work with him, why not just keep it to hanging out a little at work for a while?  "
19,"True, but it's also not guaranteed to transmit."
20,"Haha, flattering. I'm not an attorney, i was a subrogation analyst for a major health services company serving self funded ERISA health plans. So basically your mortal enemy!"
21,To be fair he isn't putting his family over the brother's *well-being*. He is putting their attendance and money over the injured brothers **attendance**.
22,"Ok, I have to comment on this and on all the armchair diagnosing here - kids can be weird without being autistic.  I was your daughter at that age.  I was weird and had no friends and was bullied.  A lot of the weird behaviors, clinginess, and social awkwardness are a result of social isolation, not the cause.  I'm not autistic and I am now socially normal as an adult, because no one is bullying or shunning me.  

Unfortunately, the only thing you can do at this point is get your daughter out of that unhealthy social environment as much as you can.  My mother said I was ""sick"" a lot and basically kept me home.  I still got excellent grades and learned things just fine, but I didn't need to be around the assholes at my school.

Also just keep trying different activities and see if she can meet some friends there.  Even one friend will really change things for her.  "
23,[deleted]
24,"^ The above. Secure your room and make sure your sister does the same. I would advise you to watch over your brother too, since he probably likes playing with them and messing around. Above all, secure the well-being of all individuals (you, sister, brother, and cat + any other pets), since your father doesn't seem to think it's a problem. You mentioned your mother, so ask for her help too if you can, and if you think she will have a more helpful reaction than your father's.

I'll say this now: do not try to discipline your cousins. It is not your job."
25,"Ironically,  they are being very childish. There's no point in trying if they're going to act like that so you're better off just being low contact with them,  if at all,  if they're not going to take you seriously. "
26,"For real.

My dad is a Baker. My mother has a PhD. But that doesn't matter to people of substance. Intellectual compatibility matters. How would she get her fucking mail if people didn't do that ""embarrassing"" job? She just kinda sucks. 

Edit: I had a great postman at my childhood home. He was the fucking bomb. Everyone loved him. I used to run into him every now and then on my way to school, and on the days I did I was always so much happier. He was so sweet and kind, always had some gummies, and just brightened up everyone's day. We always made a point to celebrate his birthday, have Christmas gifts and he'd always love to chat with anyone. Postman are cool man."
27,Why are you trying to protect your ex? It was his choice to start dating YOUR SISTER. He knew better. I'd take him to court for child support and cut him out of my life as much as possible.
28,"I am saying this as someone that took in and raised my brother and sister in the same sort of circumstance :NO!

You are not a horrible person. You are a responsible person and it sucks ass that your Mother is not supportive of you, I'm really sorry for you for that.

You can't solve this problem. It doesn't even sound like you taking in your nephew would be good for him, let alone you. The circumstances presented here lead me to believe it would be non-stop harassment from the very people this kid needs to be protected from. 

Taking in a child that isn't yours is more than just a charitable act. It's a commitment of HUGE proportions. Take all the effort raising your own child would be and add in that you would have to be fixing problems someone else caused and THEN add in those people having legal rights to CONTINUE to mess that poor kid up at every opportunity.

Both you and your nephew need to be protected from your family. You made the right call for both of you. You take care of you because that's what you can do and let family services do what they can for that child. Don't feel guilty! You both need to be saved here and that wouldn't happen if you jumped in and helped your family in any way.

I'm sorry neither of you have the family you deserve. I hope you find all the happiness you deserve away from them."
29,"1) I would recommend moving anything of value or that's irreplaceable out of the house until she's gone. Either a storage unit or a trusted friend. Don't give her the chance to get to any of your documents and ruin your credit or something. Don't give her or her cronies the chance to destroy anything of value.

2) Take photos of *everything*. How your house currently is, the awful state of her living area, everything. Email them to yourself and a few trusted friends. I would not put it past these kinds of people to either destroy your stuff or claim that your destroyed their property. It's all about CYA. 

3) Tell Sharon she is absolutely *not* allowed in your house. There is nothing anyone can say to make you let her in the house. Make sure you send this as an email or text so she can't claim ignorance. I would definitely recommend getting the police to do a civil standby on moving day anyways.

4) Be prepared to have to file for an eviction through the courts. Talking over possible next steps with an attorney (try and get a free consultation) can't hurt. "
30,"This so much. Why is OP being asked to talk to her MIL. It should be her husband that lays down the law with his side of the family, especially when it comes to their son. Lice, Junk Food, and inappropriate yelling are very good reasons for the son not to be at MIL's, and Husband needs to be the one to say so."
31,"Right? I see this as really self centred. How is this best case scenario for anyone but himself?  

**It's not fair on gf:** Who honestly would want to get engaged at a family outing with her new boyfriends kids. A proposal should be intimate, special, romantic....not a convenient excuse for a weird combo family trip.  

**More importantly, its not fair on his kids:** Putting the kids in the middle of adult stuff at a young age is a bit inappropriate I think. It will be confusing to say the least. Dad hasn't even lived with this girl, but they will still feel as though she is some sort of replacement mother (not fair, I know, but as I child of divorce, this is how I felt at the time. Its confusing). Instead of a sit-down, heart to heart talk tot he kids about mommy and daddy, and about daddies new partner etc, they get it all thrown upon them in the middle of their Disney trip. Also, being proposed to in front of OP's children puts a lot of unnecessary pressure on the GF.   

**It's not fair on ex-wife:** Unfortunately, divorce isn't always fair. But my heart breaks a bit for OP's ex. To use another commenters words: 

I honestly feel a bit sad for the ex-wife. He said he would come home every day in a bad mood and be upset with her. He said going out for dinner with her was a waste of time and money. Despite all this, she wanted to work on their relationship. She suggested counselling. He divorced her.    

She's now a single mom, with sole custody - having to do all the exhausting and difficult parts of parenting alone, whilst dad turns up whenever he has the time, to take the kids out to do fun things. He's said she remains very chill about it, allowing him the flexibility to do these things as he pleases.  


Now he's got a much younger girlfriend (ouch to the ego!), and has suddenly learnt the value of dating, going out for dinner, spoiling his partner etc - the reason why he divorced in the first place. He admitted ""this is going to crush her"", as he didn't put any effort into his first proposal, but now is planning to propose to the new girlfriend in a big, romantic way, in the place his ex-wife considers to be the 'Holy Grail' of vacations...with her kids there too sharing in their special moment.  

She's going to need a big ol bottle of wine and some good support from her social network :("
32,"It's still nice that she paid those $750, so just cancel the room using that money and pay her back with what was left after the cancellation fee. Those two can sort it out which of them takes the hit in the wallet. "
33,"Hun, not everyone is out to get you, take a deep breath and keep trying... There are lots more people who are good rather than bad. Just take it slow."
34,"Financially this is horrible advice. Free money is worth twice it's weight in loaned money, especially undefaultable student loan debt."
35,"While it's immature of your 30 year old girlfriend to still yearn for some dumb party phase...

&gt;Now I do want to clarify, I could spend more time with her. I'm not the most attendant guy in the world, I'm quite introverted and I enjoy hanging out with my friends online much more than hanging out with her. I do hang out with her, but I can't force myself to have fun. Either you enjoy hanging out with someone or you don't

This is **not** okay. You sound like my boyfriend. And although I have zero desire to party and stuff like that, I am constantly trying to spend some time with my BF but he prefers gaming and his online friends over time with me.

After months of fooling myself that he will change, I am breaking up with him.

You are guilty in this. Your girlfriend sounds immature and is partially to blame, but it sounds like YOU choose gaming over her. You have zero business being in a relationship if you recognize that you could be spending time with the GF but you don't give a shit enough to actually change. 

I love gaming too and it's what brought me and my BF together. But he does not know how to balance it with his relationships and I can't stand wasting my time waiting on him to get off the fucking computer just to have a halfway decent conversation with me. He hasn't touched me in months, sexually, no matter how much I try to touch him, flirt, etc. I can't think of the last time we had sex. Yet he's naive enough and thinks that everything is A-ok in our relationship. 

I have a very good feeling that her side of the story is different than what you're selling. As someone who is currently in your GFs shoes right now, dealing with the non-attentive boyfriend, good for her. She deserves better. Good luck finding a successful relationship with your unattentive attitude that places gaming and your gaming brahs over your damn girlfriend.

FYI, I am extremely introverted and love my alone time, and my boyfriend is actually the extroverted one. And yet, I still make myself do relationship shit. Like a normal human being. "
36,"It's the fact he held onto resentment at her for ""ruining"" them (her words) that gets to me."
37,"Well don't forget the extra layer of misogyny with him assuming the person in the accident was a woman (unless I'm missing something, cruelty aside, that is also out of left field)."
38,"&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; But do tell your step-dad what Kim said. I think Kim is expressing some genuine hurt here, she probably feels like she's been replaced as a daughter by you, and your step-dad really should reach out and try to connect with Kim if he values their relationship. Also, if he decides to give you away at the wedding, he should do that will full information.

I agree, Kim probably feels threatened and it's only fair that Saul knows what's going on. 

I also worry that Kim will be the wildcard at the wedding, so if Saul can help diffuse that bomb, that would be great, too."
39,"You don't have any blame for the rape. It's 100% on her. If the genders were flipped and you had a 14 y/o girl and a 23y/o man in the same situation, would you say the 14 y/o was 90% responsible? Or if it had been a 23 y/o man who did it to you?

Even if you'd been dancing naked in front of her, at 14 you carry no blame.

You don't have to identify with the word victim, some people use the word survivor, some have other names for it.

However it is important to acknowledge that it may have done some damage. Perhaps it's caused your inability to orgasm during penetrative sex, perhaps you're just not wired that way. Only a therapist will be able to work with you on identifying the cause.

I don't know if it's just during penetrative sex that this issue occurs, but if it includes other sexual acts (oral, mutual masturbation, hand jobs, foot jobs, whatever's your fancy), then for your gfs, past and present, it's essentially that there's nothing they can do to get you off. If it is just penetrative sex, then take it off the table while you see a therapist.

The therapist will help you correctly assign blame to your rapist, and then work with you on forgiving yourself and acknowledging your misplaced blame, and possibly her. Trust me, it will be worth it."
40,"I would go to the actual wedding ceremony(as a random guest, not as part of the wedding party), congratulate her after, and leave.  That way any camera time is minimal while still supporting her on her day. Wouldn't even tell her your leaving, just pull an Irish exit."
41,"This kind of jealous invasive behavior will likely only get worse man, you are only a year in and it sounds like the honeymoon glow is starting to wear off and you are starting to see how she acts in relationships. Her snooping to that degree is pretty ridiculous and only highlights the lack of trust she has. You need to have a separate conversation about this snooping and explain that this cannot happen in a healthy relationship. I would recommend couples counseling."
42,I think calling in on the missing house wouldn't even require a doorknock tbh.
43,"Maybe he treats *you* well, but he's not a good person.

Would you want kids with this person? Because your boys would adopt his sexist and homophobic views and your girls would think that they will never amount to anything more than baby-machines and home-makers.

He does not think women are equals. You are a woman. Go from there..."
44,"&gt;she claims that she's trying to achieve a ""work-life balance""

That's not how a work-life balance works. My husband and I work from 7-5. We get home around 5:30. We plan things to do after 5:30, either with each other or with friends. We make plans for the weekend. That is a work life balance. Not blowing off work for this, that and the other thing.

You are correct- you will not move up if you are never at work. They will see you as someone who can't be bothered to stick to the schedule. It looks bad. 

Sit her down. Explain one last time that you can't leave your job early, that your job is not like hers, and that you are going to damage your reputation if you keep leaving. She can either respect that or not. 

Do you have vacation time? Plan something together. "
45,"""Hey honey, I've been thinking about your moustache, and I've decided your face should be electrocuted until it falls out."" 

Can't see why that wouldn't go down well."
46,"&gt;It may be relatively minor but this is not the first time she's resulted to physicality during an argument. The first time was during a bad fight I was angry and slammed the door. I didn't realize that her hand was near the door and it almost closed on it. She charged that me and took a swing at me but I dodged out of the way. Another time was during a fight we had on vacation, she was giving me the silent treatment. It was late we were both tired, and my phone went off twice, she we got really upset and started hitting me over the covers on my legs and belly.

you call it ""relatively minor"" but this is two separate times where she resorted to hitting you prior to the main act that prompted you to write here.  it won't change when you're married. imagine if you have a child and the child witnesses your wife hitting you? end it now."
47,"Good grief. Just reading your post -- you need to ""sacrifice"" to begin your marriage. Taking your name would ""emasculate"" him. 

You sound too intelligent to marry a Neanderthal."
48,"Not that close, no. Talking often on the phone? Sure. Living with them and spending more time with them than me? Absolutely not. It's unattractive. Besides that a single man should be cooking his own dinner, cleaning up after himself, doing his own laundry, etc. 

Sounds like you can't have a GF, your current one is rightly annoyed/disturbed by your codepency with your sister. It wouldn't matter whether it was a sister, mother, cousin, aunt, or friend. I'd be running in the opposite direction if you wouldn't cut the cord. Haven't spent more than 2 weeks apart!? Your relationship with her is not conducive to you maintaining a long term serious romantic relationship."
49,"That is fucked up. So would her kid be under the impression that he's coming home after 2 weeks, only to be *left at what is basically a jail?* Do you understand why people are having trouble with her?

You said in another comment that she sounds worse than she is...I think you have it backwards. She is way worse than you think she is."
50,"Yeah, her husband was asking her to let her sister die. I can understand why the decision would cause him pain, but I can also understand that him just asking that of her might have been something she couldn't forgive. I love my brother, and if my husband asked me to let him die when I could have saved him, I would consider that a big sign that we just weren't as compatible as I thought.


I have a baby I love and wanted very much. I'm holding her in my arms right now as she sleeps. But I remember being two months pregnant with this wanted pregnancy and reading a story about a woman who refused cancer treatment in order to save her baby at the cost if her own life. Everyone was saying how brave and noble she was and it scared me very badly because I believed that if I ended up in her shoes society would want me to give my life for an eight week fetus I still saw as being a clump of cells. Even if it was going to grow into a baby, it wasn't a baby to me yet and I was horrified at the thought I would be expected to give my life for it. My husband reassured me that he would never want me to make that choice. I thin it would have been the same if it had been my brother, I would have chosen him in a heartbeat as well.

It sounds crazy to say that now that she's a whole baby whom I love and would save above myself or anyone else in the world. But that wasn't the case when she was the size of a pumpkin seed, you know? "
51,"Go the false positive route. Its the least offensive way to deal with this, I think. Won't make you look like total turds and won't get people looking at you with pity.

Tell you wife to think twice if she ever wants to say something like that again! =P

Happy her mom pulled through."
52,"I don't have any kind words for your mother. Please don't grow up to be like her. You obviously know right from wrong. You need to tell someone cause your bf won't (probably cause he's too scared). Any time a child is being abused (physically, sexually, mentally) authorities should be alerted. If you get in trouble with your mom for telling, you should defend yourselr because you did the right thing. You should tell her that every time he gets beaten, his life is in danger and that your mom wouldn't be able to live with herself if he died. PLEASE say something and update the post!"
53,"ugh yeah get a back up officiant, and brace yourself for a flight from them.  They sound really manipulative."
54,"&gt;She has been really upset about this, and said that I did it for my ex-girlfriend why can't I do the same for her.

What? You didn't ""do it for"" your ex-girlfriend. You learned, on a trip with her, that you'd rather not be lugging around your camera on trips. I'm with you, btw. There is no point having a bulky camera when you are walking around in Europe for 6+ hours a day. And you don't need an art photography grade camera to take vacation pics. 

&gt;She then comes up with that because my ex-girlfriend was prettier than her and blonde etc. thats why I did it for her, but not for her(my current girlfriend).

This is so unreasonable. You've explained yourself clearly, there's no need to continue to indulge her insecurities. "
55,"She doesn't sound like a very nice person, based solely on this post. I't seems like a fantasy that can't be fulfilled no matter how hard you try. Why the heck is she being childish about getting a new puppy?"
56,"Pretty funny, you know.  My dad passed away when I was 21 and it completely fucking derailed my emotional and mental health.  I never lashed out like this guy did, though.  Self-harm via depression?  You betcha.  But taking it out on others?  Abso-fucking-lutely not.

I railed on the guy in the original post and people told me I was being too harsh.  "
57,"Why are you so proud of your ""sick sense of humour"" and being ""the gross guy""? I wouldn't let you into my house either. 


I think the others have pointed it our very well: Grow up and try to be a decent person, you are 35(!). Wayyy past inappropriate jokes-age."
58,"Or a victim of past abuse. She may love this guy but think all guys will eventually turn cruel and start hitting her. She may want to reassure him she understands this ""fact"" and is ok with it. "
59,"His solution is ""if it bothers you, just ignore it."" Are you prepared to do that for everything, forever?"
60,"He's abusive. You've now agreed to marry him so the honeymoon period is over and he thinks he can engage in abusive and disrespectful behavior without losing you. Prove him wrong, do not marry him.
"
61,*I* felt my dog was a family member. I feel pets are family. 
62,"I wouldn't even tell him if you are concerned about his reaction to you and your family about it. The number one cause of death for pregnant people is *murder*. The most dangerous time for a domestic violence victim is when they are leaving the relationship. You are both pregnant and, yes, in an abusive relationship. This is a massively dangerous time for you.

Are you with your family long-term (from you saying ""I don't want to go back"" it seems like you could just decide to stay)? If so, send a message -- ""We're done. I'm breaking up with you"". Then delete his number, remove him and any associates from your FB page, lock it down *hard*. Screen calls from unknown numbers, maybe even get a burner phone for the short term (so you have one phone with a new number you can use for doctor's appointments that you *know* will be safe to answer). You may need to also go to the police station -- start up a paper trail that can be used to get him off your back with a restraining order (or even more jail time if he's still on probation -- IANAL so this isn't a guarantee).

You're in love with him, so of course you wish to help him turn his life around. But unless *he* wants to change, nothing you can do or say will ever have an impact. Depending on his personality, he might decide to dig his heels in and do the exact opposite (or, given how he's been acting, accuse you of being nagging, whining, escalating on his comments and even potentially turning violent). You manage you, and he...will either turn his life around or he won't. But nothing you can do will change him."
63,"As a man, I can tell you that he's most probably falling for her. I'm sorry, there is probably not much you can do. Do not have a child with him."
64,They didn't say everyone without a relationship status on Facebook is banging other people. That's ridiculous. They said that this one *obviously cheating girl* has no relationship status for that reason. 
65,"Just a word of caution. Make sure for the first few months that you are checking in early and often. Lots of these homes (even expensive ones) put on a good song and dance for the families but are actually not very good places. Having worked in EMS for years in several states I have been in hundreds of these places. Id say I would trust about 10% of them to care for my loved ones. Even if they aren't actively malicious, many are under-staffed or under-trained. So just saying to make sure she is actually getting the care she needs long-term."
66,"&gt; I can objectively see that I'm not high on his list of priorities 

Well, if you've talked to him about this and it hasn't changed, then it's on purpose. If it were me, I'd date someone who makes time for me and wants to see me and doesn't cancel last minute or no show for our dates. I get that you love him, but date a guy who will love you back."
67,"Yes. Pregnant. One dog sits on me whenever possible and sticks to me like glue. The other one gives me sad reproachful looks of betrayal. 

It's wierd. Pregnancy is wierd. "
68,Honestly the only thing I can think of is that sometimes people dont know how to react to kindness. Maybe you're the first person in a long time to do something so nice and they just dont know how to accept it
69,"Her parents are being realistic. You started dating their 20 year old daughter when you were 35. Because of you, she dropped out of graduate school.The odds of your marriage lasting are quite slim, and their daughter is going to spend many of her youngest years where she should be going out, meeting people, furthering her education, and having fun, with you. It seems sensical to me that she could at least console herself with knowing her daughter will at least get financial compensation."
70,"&gt; I guess my confusion is because I've known Ashley for years and years, and she knows I'm not unsafe and I wouldn't rape anyone and haven't.

And that's what half our friend group said about the guy who raped me.  They didn't believe it because he was ""such a nice guy"" and ""would never do that to anyone"", but he did. He raped me.

And last summer a friend of my SO made a rape joke.  I don't have flashbacks and expect everyone to sensor any triggers for me, but a rape joke is just in SUCH BAD TASTE and shows a real lack of social awareness.  One in 4 women has been sexually assaulted in North America, and even though many of us heal and move on, when you crack a rape joke, it makes us think of that day.  There is no way to prevent that.  So socially aware and considerate people do NOT make rape jokes.

And I would actually bet a lot of money that your friends don't think the rape jokes are funny either, but because you're ""that off color friend"", they humor you along and put up with it because they're too nervous to tell you they don't think it's funny either.

Consider the fact that they are all siding with Sarah on this (who has either likely been raped, or just has the balls to say ""that's not fucking funny""), and not you, their friend of many years.  This is their opening to tell you it's not funny and to knock that shit off.

Also consider your friend group.  If it has more than 3 women in it, it is very likely one of them has been assaulted and doesn't find your jokes funny either.

Moral of the story: get a better sense of humor that doesn't involve cracking jokes about women being forcibly and violently raped in a way that causes lifelong trauma.
"
71,"I am going to assume she is otherwise not shallow and materialistic and say that most likely this has nothing to do with the value of the ring itself, but like others have said, the fact that overall you've invested less in the relationship with her because of some sob story you're clinging to about what an ex did to you. You are almost 30 years old; people get hurt, and adults do not punish people for others' mistakes. And it sounds like this isn't the first instance where she's felt this way; quite honestly it sounds like you're probably the one who isn't ready to get married. A better ring isn't going to fix this- getting over your cliche fixation on ""not getting hurt again,""  being sappy and head over heels and dopey and allowing her in to be the one capable of hurting you, that is love and that is what she deserves from her future husband. If you really have this attitude of ""nothing is certain"" about her, don't put her through this, and for god's sake don't marry her. "
72,"Step away.  Be grateful this women brought you this awareness about yourself.   Thank her and take this knowledge to a therapist and your wife.  A relationship with this women will not stop you from growing old.  This is the definition of a mid life crisis.  Close your marriage while you sort this out.

She is not a magical angle fairy come to save your life, she is a women you barely know.   You owe it to your marriage to sort yourself and that relationship out before you make any changes. Stop seeing her, its not what you think it is."
73,Fuck it. I just showered and I'm getting dressed to go meet them. Guns are OUT y'all. Calling his stupid bluff.
74,"Cleaning out deceased teacher's belongings and yes, this will be found among her keepsakes. 

Teaching is such a thankless task most of the time.  If anyone has ever had a teacher that made a positive difference on any academic level - please tell them."
75,"&gt;She says: No! Just her and me. No kids.

SMH, 20 years of marriage and you even have to *ask* this question? Come on man!"
76,"She was in high school when they started dating, he was 23. He convinced her to drop out and move across the country. She probably has no idea what a normal, healthy relationship looks like because she may never have seen one. "
77,"Your girlfriend wants you to make up with a person who **punched you in the face?** Is she trying to minimize what happened (you weren't really injured, she was drunk, etc.), or does she fully understand the gravity of what happened but would rather you be assaulted than her lose a friend?

I know I asked, but I'm honestly not sure which would be worse."
78,"&gt; Lol who said I do?

You, by arguing with literally every person in this thread. YOU asked for advice. Take it or don't, but don't argue with EVERY person's assessment of the situation. You ASKED us to assess it, and now you don't like what you're hearing. The truth hurts sometimes. Get over it and do what's right."
79,Same here. In my house if you don't like what I cook you can fend for yourself.
80,"You did all these things to make up but the one thing she is clearly wanting: to leave her alone.

You're putting what YOU want-her forgiveness-above her feelings. That's not respecting her or the boundaries she has clearly laid out. Why should she believe you've changed when you continually hound her to accept you?

I know this sounds harsh because I do believe you mean well, but you're actually making things so much WORSE.

You need to give her space. She may never forgive you no matter what, and you need to accept that for your own sake.

Live a good life, do good deeds, and maybe someday you'll be granted a second chance by showing her with actions the person you are now is not the same violent teenager. Maybe.

But you can't push or force this. I know it hurts, it sucks, but you NEED to let her be. 

Talk to your parents about alternating holidays with her, and be clear you are now respecting her boundaries but are also not going to cut off your family completely. You can respect that she doesn't wish to see you without punishing yourself forever.  Stop sending letters or gifts and be clear that you will not approach her at family events if she does attend.

Make compromises. It's unfair but this is a bad situation all around, so you need to make the best of it.

I wish you luck OP. This was a really, really bad mistake, but don't let it define the rest of your life. Forgive yourself, do better and move on, but don't try to force her to do the same. It will only hurt you both."
81,"You let him experience the consequences of his actions (or inaction). That's the way to do it. 

It really is hard to care for a sick adult. I had to take care of my father when he was dying of cancer. The drugs made him crazy and abusive. It was like dealing with a 2 year old. Plus the amount of work involved in taking care of the house and him at the same time, even with hospice and a home aide, was brutal. Helpless as a baby all day long but as soon as the sun went down he would start trashing the house. I had to hire a sitter so I could sleep at night."
82,"I'm not seeing why you seemingly think she owes you sex on Father's Day. Sex to me is a mutual act done for enjoyment and intimacy. Not because of a certain day.

&gt;Basically her opinion was if I wanted sex I should have asked

You had all day to ask her. Don't blame her bedtime rule for you not asking.

&gt;Sometimes she'll have sex with me, but she's be clearly uninterested and then gets upset when I can't climax. I'm not sure if you've ever had the pleasure of having sex with someone who wants to do anything other than fucking you, but it's awful. It makes me feel worse than if we never had sex at all.

Yet you still continue having one sided sex solely for your physical pleasure. And yes I state physical pleasure because you know she's not interested so I can't see how you can claim 'intimacy'. If this one sided sex truly made you feel worse than no sex you would be turning it down. 

&gt;Buying her random art and gifts every few weeks since she brought it up. She has ignored me since and I have to ask for sex and get shot down before she'll sleep with me the next night

So basically you think since you do her love language she owes you sex for your love language? You do know that obligation sex will be what you get right? Do you just want her to have sex and not act disinterested or do you want mutually enjoyable and intimate sex?

&gt;What broke me was when I asked, ""Did the idea of having sex with me on Father's Day ever cross your mind?"" and she said, ""No.""

Why would it cross her mind? Going by your posts it's a chore for her and one you seemingly want to make even worse for her with painful creativity since you whine about vanilla sex. Even when she does it despite not wanting to you claim it's worse than not having sex (yet you still continue taking her offer).

&gt;That means she's either ignoring what I'm telling her is important to me, or doesn't care.

More likely she doesn't care and I'm not seeing any reason why she should. Basically even when you both want and enjoy it sex seems to be a disappointment to you because it's vanilla. And the sex you do idealize hurts her. 

My advice is either having mutually enjoyable and intimate sex when you BOTH want sex or divorce her to find a partner with the same or similar sex drive as you."
83,"* She is the one planning it
* She intends to make money from it
* She is ""meeting people""

This is a work trip that you are tagging along.

**You should not be paying for the hotel!** it is a business deduction for her."
84,"Probably a weird thing to fixate on, but are you saying you started dating her when she was 12?"
85,"Yeah, just go to work and if it comes up laugh it off with the rest of them. ""Jeez, that was embarrassing but I luckily I found out he was insane sooner rather than later, eh?"""
86,"Paternity test ASAP. Not saying you aren't the daddy, but with that timeline, you need to be sure!"
87,"I don't mean to jump in because your post is mostly correct - but this can actually be a serious issue if it goes on and is not treated. If the foreskin continues to tighten, it can lead to urinary problems and infection. If he gets even a tiny cut on the skin, again, it can lead to a nasty infection. "
88,"Right and Sarah was being weird at work because this guy sending all these ""I'm really into you and think about you all the time"" signals has gotten engaged to someone else?? OP's man is a hot mess who can't commit to either woman and would rather mess with both their hearts instead of choosing one and going with it."
89,"Okay-- you're getting lots of ""let 'er rip!"" comments but I wanted to address part of your post:

&gt; I have a very gross family that jokes about farting, boogers, sex and all kinds of things that make her very uncomfortable.

Do you do this around her? Do say ""excuse me"" after you fart/burp/whatever? Farting is normal, but it seems pretty clear that she's not looking for a partner who jokes about farting or who is ""gross."" Can I gently ask how often you shower? Do you leave skidmarks in the toilet? Are there ways in which your bodily functions might be just a little too present everyday? Are you picking your nose/ears/bellybutton right there on the couch?

For some people, ""gross"" is a dealbreaker. The farts might just be the one thing that pushes her over the edge in a line of ""dude, you are grossing me out and I need some mystery in our relationship."" Open up a conversation-- accidental farts happen and she may be way more likely to ignore them if you show that you hear her opinions and are willing to keep some of the bodily fluids/sounds/products to yourself. "
90,"&gt;Jason didn’t respond to Dan but then he got another text saying “if she doesn’t apologize than I have no choice not to be around her or bring Laya around her. And that will affect our friendship.” Seems a bit manipulative to me


Yeah it is pretty manipulative. His girlfriend came into your home and disrespected your lifestyle which to be honest, rescuing animals is like something laudable. This girl has issues and the fact that your Fiance didn't tell Dan to correct Laya speaks volumes of their relationship dynamic.


If not this, then something else Laya will bring up or bash you guys. Where do you draw the line? Dan is the one affecting the friendship by allowing his girlfriend to disrespect his long time friends future wife.


The fact that he is trying to throw it onto Jason I think speaks volumes of the type of friend he is."
91,"Exactly. Nothing she says makes sense. But I don't question her beliefs and insult her for them. 

I have no idea what she wants from us...which is why it's hard to be around her. "
92,She's the one who suggested you guys practice making out. I think there's a good chance she likes you. 
93,"Instead of dismissing your wife's input in your shared household as ""just housework"" and changing your mind on her not having to work, I strongly advise you to get therapy _first_.

You obviously have some leftover stuff going on from your hard times (and good on you for getting over that, often that doesn't happen without help!) and they are interfering with how you see your wife's ""asking for money"" (and probably some other stuff too that you're not consciously realising).

Go alone _and_ have some sessions together, so that she understands where you are coming from too and what you are dealing with.

If after that you still think she should contribute financially to the household (although her contributions aren't financially rewarded, she _is_ contributing!), then that is something you can work through without the influence of your past interfering with your discussion."
94,"Especially if they admired the relationship. Op and Jamie were likey the it couple. With how take charge Op is, she might have been the glue that held a lot of people together, the planner, and people followed her. Op sounds like a great person and changing her life up, with two kids, probably put a damper on their ""Adventures of Twenty Somethings Doing Shit Together Like Sex in the City."" "
95,"Dave is almost entirely at fault, and I think you know that's the case. He is angry, controlling, and doesn't seem to know much about parenting. Almost a stereotype of a bad stepfather. All discipline without the affection and understanding that sometimes temper that parenting style.

I think it may be ultimatum time. If Dave won't make real efforts by seriously working to get in therapy, possibly getting on meds, changing his attitude, and doing some reading on positive step-parenting, then maybe you two need to separate.

Have you checked with r/stepparents? People there have a different attitude toward the role of a step-parent and may be able to recommend some good resources if Dave is willing to work on himself."
96,"Honey, you need to start seeing a therapist. The depression you are experiencing from not being around your husband is not normal. You have been through a lot (being cheated on, losing your son), and it's understandable that you are having a hard time coping. You're starting to recognize that your current manifestation of grief is not normal nor is it healthy long-term. A good therapist can help you answer the questions you asked, help you deal with the grief, help you figure out how to function normally again, and not solely rely on your husband. You will be able to gain other tools to cope. It may take a few tries to find a therapist you 'click' with and one who helps you make progress--that's okay. Please call today and make an appointment. "
97,"Made a new account so I could have a long term throwaway.

Like others in this thread I'm [22F] also a sibling to a low functioning autistic child who has also been diagnosed with ADHD [13M]. I'm also in the beginnings of planning my own wedding. I've talked about about having my brother at the wedding at length with my SO, thought really hard on it for a while. We are deciding not to have him at our wedding for a few important reasons. 

1. We will be spending a lot of money on our wedding for the enjoyment of our guests.
2. It would not be fair to place the burden on my parents, his caretakers, to watch over him (ie. making sure he doesn't run off, stick his hands in the food, bump into guests, etc) while they are attending such a formal event. My brother is fast and slippery, like a fish. It was easier to manage him at your son's age (just pick him up and hold him, if he will let you), but at 13 he is almost as big as my dad. If he won't listen, there's not much we can do.
3. There will be so many people, so much going on that he will most likely get over stimulated and have a meltdown.
4. Even if he doesn't have a meltdown, he yells very loudly when he is happy anyway.

My other brother, his neurotypical twin, will be attending the wedding. It's not that I favor one sibling over another. I'd love to have my autistic brother at my wedding if possible. But in the end it is too difficult to make arrangements that will suit him, especially when he will not understand the significance of the event anyway. And if I keep my other brother out of the wedding out of ""fairness"", he will miss out.

I cannot speak for your sister but I hope this might give you some insight on how she may feel.



"
98,"&gt; She's always been quick to ""ditch"" me when she gets a new boyfriend

WHAT?! Like seriously why is she still important to you? It's your wedding, YOUR BIG DAY and she's still pulling this shit on you? I wouldn't stand her for 14 years. Find yourself another best friend."
99,"Lie. 

""Oh I was able to call the department and get them to add a note to the file that you were a homemaker that volunteers in her free time."""
100,"Yeah, dude, you are in the wrong here. Why do you not believe your girlfriend when she tells you concisely what the problem is? Why do you decide she's interpreting things wrong? Why is it ""all in her head""?

Sara's friend was having a birthday party that YOU invited people to, who took over the party, and proceeded to get so wasted that they were unable to get home alone, and then you get mad because Sara is upset you took over HER FRIEND'S PARTY and wanted to go salvage a good time? What the fuck, man.

Believe Sara when she says she's being treated rudely - from YOUR OWN description here, SHE IS. Believe her when she says your precious party buddies talk over her. EVEN IF she was wrong about all that, which she isn't, she has the right to not hang out with people she doesn't click with. She's not telling you to not hang out with them, just saying she doesn't want to. Jesus."
101,"I was a Girl Scout leader a long time ago and we had more than one parent sell a lot of cookies and just never turned the money in--one because she was super poor and couldn't cover her rent and another because her house was blown away in a tornado. I don't remember what we did ultimately, but I seem to recall other troops and the regional council taking up a collection for our girls. Our girls were pretty mature about it.
"
102,"That's similar to my story, only I was the girl who covered the other girl when I saw her pants with blood on them. The girl sat in front of me and stood up to go to the chalkboard,  I saw a huge red spot on her ass and immediately threw my sweater around her waist. This girl hated me and spread rumors about me so her natural reaction was to ask me what the hell I thought I was doing, but I whispered to her that she was bleeding. 
We went to the bathroom and she proceeded to have a breakdown. She had no idea what to do and was scared her friends saw, they'd laugh and make fun of her. I called my mom at work and she brought a change of pants and some pads. The girl had no idea how to handle her period because her parents never taught her anything. My mom went over things for her and drove her home after school. 
When girls get their periods it can be terribly traumatic,  especially when they have no one to help them. And sadly there are still people who won't let their kids learn about these things in health class. "
103,"Because he wants monogamy from you, but not for himself. 
"
104,"Thank you. You're right. There has been a lot of breaking boundaries on her end... I just want this ONE thing, lol. "
105,"It depends on the state, he has no guarantee to his own bedroom, but he must have a bedroom. And he cannot share with the married couple due to his age. If he is sharing with the new baby there are requirements on how much square footage the bedroom must have. "
106,"&gt; You need to know that it's not your fault if he gets kicked out

Indeed. OP, this is one of the possible outcomes of your parents' talk with your brother tonight. If it does come to this, don't feel bad: your brother's actions make him a potential danger to you in the first instance, but a ~~junkie~~ addict [EDIT: as /u/dwmfives points out below, this kid is a human being and deserves treatment and help as soon as he is ready to except them] in the house is ultimately a danger to everyone equally - both you and them. 

If your brother gets kicked out over this, then it is happening for everyone's safety. That would not be your fault, and you would have no reason to feel guilty about it.
"
107,"Oddly enough, I actually think that the way they're currently handling it is the best, in terms of meal selection. OP is actually being more flexible than she is, allowing the children to experience both. It's the best solution when only one parent is vegetarian. It's too bad she can't see that. "
108,"As someone who was vegetarian for about 15 yrs, married to an omnivore for 10 of those yrs, cooking 2 meals is what we had to do. It was a bit annoying...I figured out pretty quickly to make a vegetarian meal I could add meat to, so it usually amounted to 1 extra dish and I had 2 separate meals. I did not tell him he wasn't allowed to eat meat...and as a result of me not forcing or guilting or otherwise nagging him about eating meat, he was not resentful or wary of vegetarian meals and actually ate some of my meals regularly without the added meat. Neither of us felt restricted or controlled...and there was no animosity about food. 

But if the wife here has changed the style of food...that might be part of the problem. OP is not interested in eating what she made. OP did not say she isn't allowed to cook it, he simply made something else for him, and made enough to share with the kids. I see absolutely no problem with this. The wife should be grateful her husband is supporting her moral and medical dietary change without trying to force her beliefs on him or their kids.

Pushy vegetarians make it harder for the rest of us to be vegetarian. Vegetarianiam is like religion in some ways. She's new to it, so is super excited about her new lifestyle and wants to share it...but we wouldn't be so supportive of her if she was pushing a religion down everyone's throats. She needs to calm down her enthusiasm and start looking at ways of making meals that are more palatable to everyone instead of feeling so left out."
109,"Jeez, OP, break up with your boyfriend.  He's throwing off red flags like they're going out of fashion.

He's controlling, he has a bad temper that he takes out on you.  He makes your life miserable, he doesn't trust you and he takes your things (your phone) without your permission and goes through them (your private messages).

He's demeaning to you AND he abandons you to ensure that you can't make it to a party.

He's an asshole, and you shouldn't put up with him.  Dump him and get on with your life (though maybe make sure your friends all know why you're dumping him and that you shouldn't be alone where he can appear because holy shit he sounds like he'll get violent)."
110,Except for when their drama causes her to meltdown...
111,"&gt; There is literally no reason for me not to come with you

If I was just coming out of surgery I wouldn't be in the mood to meet new people, personally speaking. I mean, I'm about to get cut open and now I have to humor some random person I haven't met? No thanks."
112,I think the two weeks is very telling. Wonder if the co worker broke things off or went back to her abuser (who may or may not be an abuser).
113,"You know your sister, do you really think if you had passed away because she didn't donate that she would have been able to deal with the fact that she could has saved you but didn't? Death is scary, and it was undoubtly terrifying for you, but being the ones left behind is a hundred times worse. How would you feel if the situation was reversed? Even if her ex had been able to move past it, I personally find it doubtful that she would ever forgive him for trying to push her into letting her brother die when she, and she was probably the only one, could save you. Its something I could never forgive."
114,I think a lot of men do this. But there was no point in him telling you about it so bluntly. Sometimes honesty is thinly-veiled cruelty.
115,He has been feeding your addiction. He is not innocent.
116,Link him this post and be done with him. He's an asshole
117,"What I'm about to say probably has little bearing on whether you stay or leave. But it sounds like your husband (and you, by extension) isn't actively taking care of these kids. They don't sleep ever? Er, they should have a bedtime and they should stay in their rooms with the lights off after that time. If they don't sleep, they don't sleep, but they shouldn't be milling about the house interrupting your conversations. When I saw your questions above (what do kids need--clothes, friends??), I wondered the same thing: To what extent is your husband actually dealing with these children as children? Dealing with the legal side of things is, of course, important. But having legal issues to work out or being in a crisis situation doesn't mean the kids get to run wild. They need order and structure, not more chaos. If your husband isn't actively dealing with that stuff--or even thinking about it--no wonder you're exhausted. I would not be surprised in the slightest if your husband was letting them run wild because he feels guilty about the situation they're in and overwhelmed on top of it. But he's dealing with those feelings in exactly the wrong way. "
118,"You probably wouldn't have panicked and lied if he wasn't a hot head who blows up at you about things like....doing his laundry. Is this how you want to spend your life, really?"
119,"OP already nailed that it was a bullshit excuse. The ""mom"" thing had ZERO to do with this. If it weren't the ""mom"" thing it would have been something else. She wanted to back out without actually saying the phrase ""because I am a small person"".

She's simply not able to handle her own guilt, grief, remorse, fears, &lt;insert negative emotion here&gt;. After 14 years, OP gave her a shot to show she's matured and she blew it. No third strike for this woman. If she ever wants to see her son again, she'll have to wait until he's an adult and approach him directly."

122,"So hey, this kind of thing will really, really fuck with your head. I remember how I felt the first time my father touched me inappropriately- I felt like something was wrong with me, I felt about two inches tall, I felt like scrubbing my skin off, I felt nauseous all the time. I haven't seen him in a decade, haven't spoken to him in three years, and writing this right now has me sitting here hanging my head because just *thinking* about it makes me feel tiny.

So yeah, dementia is a possibility. Inappropriate behavior with people who are bipolar is a possibility, too. But you know what? Having a *why* doesn't change that it affects the way you feel. About him, about yourself, about your body, about your life. 

You aren't overreacting. That feeling of disgust, the shame? That's what happens.

Take self-care seriously, okay? Don't minimize the way you feel. Take yourself and your feelings seriously.

And just so you can hear it from an outside voice and not just what you're telling yourself against the bad feelings in your head: this isn't your fault. This isn't your body's fault. Your body is not lewd. The size of your breasts didn't cause this."
123,"&gt; after the first I love you, then what?

Motherfucker I SAID I LOVE YOU DID YOU HEAR ME OR DID YOU SUDDENLY GO DEAF shit"
124,"When you leave---and you must, this situation is not sustainable for you---go to the police and tell them about the abuse and that you have a minor sister who is in danger. The police may be able to remove her from that house and place her somewhere safe. Move *far* away and don't attempt to contact any of them including little sister. You can't risk them finding out where you've gone, or beating it out of her. But tell the police everything. That way not only might sister be possibly rescued, you have it on file that your family has pulled this kind of crap on you so that you will more easily be able to request help from the police if your family does find word of you."
125,"How did she want you to handle her outburst?

I mean, what was her ideal version of that?

I'd ask her that and then ask how what she wanted was possible given her actions at the time?

You tried to help her, she wouldn't communicate.  None of that is on you unless something is being left out...but either way, she was the one that shut communication down."
126,"You're honestly over analyzing it a bit too much. 

Just ask him. :)

As a former 16yr old male, I can probably say with confidence that he'll balk at the wheelchair and any special accommodations.

Just sit him with your family, he'll use crutches to get to the table and probably won't move much."
127," It's clear the girlfriend's reaction had nothing to do with gossip. She feels like this is a huge part of OP's life that has been kept from her. In her head she is thinking that OP only confides in people who she really loves and trusts, so the fact that she wasn't told makes her think they're not on the same page about the relationship. This makes me think of the post from a few days ago where the husband hadn't told his wife of many years about something tragic that had happened to him when he was younger. (Obviously a marriage and a 2 yr relationship are different. I'm just trying to provide insight into the gf's feelings.)"
128,"Oh for christs sake, you mean your family CAN survive on dads income, and she is just doing this insane shit for a LUXURY?  Jesus christ, I'd let her fuck off on her own to be free of her shit."
129,"That's not the nuclear option, that's the best option, one of the problems here is that you are going along with her crazy behavior instead of nipping it immediately like you should have and it is enabling her to be more bold.

My ex wanted to do all sorts of crazy when we got divorced, walk into the house uninvited, sit next to me at events, ask me if we could still have sex, not release my kids to me on my court ordered scheduled time. 

What you should be doing is keeping a copy of your court ordered schedule in your vehicle so you always have it handy, you go to the police(like I did) and give them a heads up about what is happening, when your next event is likely to occur and what they will do to help, you also tell your lawyer in an email every time it happens so that's it's documented for use in court later, include who witnessed the event. When your ex wife shows up you tell her if she does not leave immediately you will call the police, you need to have the guts to actually do it. If something randomly occurs and the police have no prior info they will not be especially helpful because without the actual documents it's your word vs hers as to who has custody of the child at that time(when your son is involved) but her harassing you in general, like the birth of your kid is just harassment.

Right after my divorce my ex wanted to be dramatic and walk into my house like she lived there and would do things like refuse to release my kids on my custody day(we had 50-50) I just stayed cool but firm on having to involve the police and their were two incidents, me threatening to call the police if she didn't get out of the house and the other for not releasing the kids on x-mas(ex's are so nice on holidays /s), she stopped when she knew I was serious and wasn't playing along.

You're very lucky your current wife has tolerated all this, I'm very judgmental of how people handle their ex's because I know how huge of a headache it can be, I feel like if I have mine ""contained"" so should others, I handle my ex like I'm a lawyer doing my job, there is no emotion tied to it, every thing is matter of fact and the bare minimum that is required, I get the occasional hateful text(all communication is text or email, haven't talked on the phone in years so it can be documented, I have been back in court with her and it was very helpful) one time she chewed me out at our son's baseball game for a couple minutes for lord knows what reason, I just walked off and kept walking.

It's great that she has a good relationship with your son but you have to realize there is nothing left between you two that requires you to put up with her antics, get a game plan in place with your family and stonewall this behavior before it ruins your current marriage.

As for going back to court my ex took me back 12 months after our divorce, it's not like when you first get divorced, the Judge will now examine how things have worked out with your current custody arrangement, the family court wants to maintain a consistent schedule and environment if possible, without good reason they will not remove your son from your home. My ex wife tried to play the psychologically abusive card but due to our text and email only contact I could show that she never expressed any concern, her claims that my children were unstable and acting out at home back fired because she could only show this behavior in her own home, school they were model students and my house they were perfect, this was confirmed by their teachers who I met with at the parent teacher meetings and I had their reports as well, she also said I was controlling and manipulative because I would only text or email, the Judged literally scoffed at her and lectured her about how she was being dramatic, he had reviewed the texts and emails and I was doing a perfect job of staying on point and keeping the communication to a minimum and only about the kids. So if you haven't done anything major to your son then you should be ok if your ex takes you back to court, plus, at this point your son is getting old enough he can provide insight into his own home life."
130,"I wonder if it was the vulnerability you felt being so sick and the intimacy that you two shared getting through it together that made you fall for him that way. 

Personally, I don't think your situation is as complex as it may seem..the biggest complexity is that there's money involved.

I disagree with hint dropping tbh. You two are married adults. It's clear he cares for you in how you describe his actions but I think for this situation, it won't be easy but you should sit him down and tell him... And I'll tell you why..

Because if you don't and he remains neutral, you may miss an opportunity thinking he is not reciprocating how you feel. But in reality he can't/doesn't pick up on your hints and remains neutral because that's what you two agreed upon.

Another reason why you should talk to him is that what you feel is real, and likely won't go away easily. It may even get stronger..so harboring these feelings and seeing him continue to date will be very unhealthy for not just you but the relationship you have. I know it's a risk that can potentially be painful but I think you should go to counseling him or privately tell him how you've been feeling. 

I don't want to give you false hope or make you feel like you're doomed but I do see positives to this:

- your relationship seems solid
-sex life is good, you are attracted to each other.
* you both already know what it's like with other partners.
- you both care deeply for one another.
- You are already married :)

So then it's time to make a decision then...

Do you continue to harbor this with it potentially coming out anyway or do you lay your cards and heart on the table and see where that may or may not lead?"
131,"So everyone posting here saying she is just having fun, would be alright with their bf being naked around naked women? or their gf being naked around naked men? Also why is her phone airplane mode when her husband is sick

132,ER visits are expensive. I suggest at least texting your mom and letting her know where you're going and bringing your insurance card if at all possible. Not all hospitals take all insurances and they are super expensive. 
133,"It's so hard to explain to people who see someone with Alzhimers for a few hours on a ""good day"" what it's like living with them 24/7. I get so annoyed when I see Alzhimers portrayed as just being forgetful or like permanent amnesia, and not the 90 minute screaming session in the middle of the night, the eating non-edible things. It really takes a whole team to take care of someone in that situation, glad your husband (finally) made the right choice. "
134,"&gt;But I am kinda suspecting that he's expecting you to do all the child rearing and this is an excuse, not an argument. Have you asked him how he's planning to help if not with changing diapers?

Considering the second part of the objection was ""and it's your job,"" I strongly suspect you're right. Maybe he really thinks it's gay and maybe he doesn't, but I doubt he would change a little girl's diapers either. Combined with OP knowing she's a slow learner ""according to her husband,"" this guy just sounds like bad news.

OP, what is your expected division of labor regarding the baby? Has your husband demonstrated a willingness to do things besides changing diapers? Or is this the first real discussion you've had about what work you expect him to do?"

Compliment her on how gorgeous she is in the picture.  Don't do anything else remotely.

When she gets back, bring it up casually, and tell her that you want to keep that glorious bounty all for yourself.  See what she says.  Likely she'll tell you ""silly girl thing"" as above, and you can sleep quiet.

141,Sooo your boyfriend has another girlfriend. How do you feel about that?
142,"Mismatched sex-drives is the NP-Hard problem of marriage. You guys need to explore all of your options, seek counseling. A reddit post isn't going to give you meaningful advice. Your story sounds very one-sided, with the way you allude to having ""anger problems"".

You did act kind of... unintelligent there. Coming at your S.O. with basically ""I'm disappointed you didn't do the thing, even though I didn't even ask you to and expected you to read my mind, and I know from experience you often are not up to doing the thing."" You have years and years of this mismatched libido situation. Years of past Father's Days.  You keep doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outside. That is the definition of insanity.

Arguing with someone and telling them how they've disappointed you isn't going to make them want to have sex with you, (unless they have some kinky fetish).

I don't know what you should do, but step one of any plan should be to first accept reality, see it for what it is instead of engaging in wishful thinking like you did on ""Father's Night""."
143,"Hi Op,

This sounds like a cult. That is a very scary word, and rightfully so. This has to be treated VERY CAREFULLY, and I would highly suggest you scrutinize the advice you're about to receive here. 

It sounds like this is something that has been built up for years. DO NOT underestimate that. Brain washing is a real, powerful thing. It is NOT cured by tough love or ultimatums. It is NOT cured by isolation and harsh truths. People here will tell you to do these things, and I urge you to ignore them. That is an immature, shallow response to what is a very deep and complex problem.

The number one tool that cults leverage is isolation. They cut you off from your friends and family, your support system, similar (if not identical) to abuse situations. If you decide to cut off your mother you are absolutely within your right to do so, and it would be completely normal and valid, but please understand that it will not be the wake up call posters here will tell you it is. 

Telling her it's a cult or bad for her will only strengthen her resolve to say in her same exact situation. Do you think the members are unaware people will say these things? They've already trained (yes, trained) your mother in how to correctly respond to that criticism. If anything, it encourages the image that the cult members are ethereal and all knowing, because this is something they accurately predicted would happen. She already knows all of the justifications to brush your concerns under the rug. All it will do is prove to her that you are evil and the cult was right.

The MOST IMPORTANT thing you can do is to make sure your mother is not isolated. Continue to spend time with her, encourage her to continue seeing her other friends and to keep in contact with her family. Limit the amount of damage she can do to herself and the people around her (ie isolate her from finances) by working with your father. You cannot fix this, and it would be naïve to think you could. A professional needs to fix this. The only thing you can do is to ensure that you keep some part of her grounded in the real world so she doesn't completely float off into space.

This is a very delicate situation. This is not something to go on Reddit about. I've said this a few times but I will say it again: PLEASE be cautious about taking the advice you're about to receive on this board. What I suggest you do is to seek out a mental health professional and ask their advice. They can help you and, ultimately, help your mother. People here cannot help you. 

"

146,"OP, please keep in mind that this comment is intended to help, not to hurt...but I'm struggling to phrase this in a delicate way, and I know many other commenters are having difficulty with this as well. So let's just review the facts from your post:

At the onset of your relationship:

**You**

* 20 years old
* no high school diploma (or even a GED at the time)
* work at starbucks
* come from ""humble upbringing""

**BF**

* 36 years old
* very successful business man
* wealthy
* locally famous
* so famous he makes TV appearances
* very popular
* allows and enjoys women flirting with him, even while you're *right there*
* owns multiple vacation properties

Just curious, when he asked for your number in the beginning- what did he say? 

When you started dating, what did he say he likes about you?

 What do you guys have in common and what do you talk about? 

When you got pregnant after less than a year, what did he say about it? Were you trying to get pregnant, or was it unplanned? How far along are you? 

(These are not rhetorical questions- I feel like the answers will really provide insight)."
147,"I can't believe no on picked up on the boyfriend! He's super awful too. Honey, if he wanted to have sex he could have found someone who wanted to have sex. Instead he wore you down. That's not someone who respects you. "

153,"Here's my first point: quitting cold turkey antidepressant medication, particularly the common SSRIs, is one of the worst things that you can do to your brain chemistry. And yes, sleep deprivation can be an effect of abruptly discontinuing antidepressants. 

Now, this doesn't absolve your husband at all. For someone who has battled depression for most of his life, and has presumably been on antidepressants for a significant time, it should've been abundantly clear to him how dangerous not following medication instructions can be. If the lack of medication led to his assault, then it means he made two poor choices instead of one. 

On top of that, caring for disabled individuals puts your husband in an immense level of power over another person. I can't condone his behavior, but most people can at least understand how someone can break under such circumstances during a time of stress. However, that he lied about it afterwards and blamed it on the person he was meant to care for, quite frankly that's disgusting. "

158,"It's okay that this is a dealbreaker. 

For future reference though, talking about your girlfriend's previous sex life with other people is pretty rude and classless. In this situation, it worked out that your girlfriend was lying to you, which is really the best case scenario. Worst case scenario, your friends lie to you and purposely ruin your trust in a girlfriend because they want to set you up with someone else, don't like your future girlfriend, or because someone in the group wants to date you. It's not your place to talk about your partner's sex life with other people. 

You said you're happier without her, so you should stay broken up, but in the future, if dating someone with a low amount of sexual partners is important to you, talk about that at the beginning of the relationship, and not in a large group of people.

Also wait for him to apologize. Don't get in his car or order dinner unless he apologizes for the way he behaved last time. If he does any of those things, walk away. Be prepared to walk away at all times: have any possessions within easy reach, and know what will happen in terms of paying (e.g. have exact change ready to leave on the table so you can just walk out).

Also, he shouldn't be allowed back in your apartment.

The house is yours.  You will need to take care of it, on your own.  That's okay.  It's more responsibility but it's also a bit of an adventure.  If finances are a concern, I recommend that you consider getting one or two (non-romantic) roommates."

Stand up now and let them know that you're going to be using the same resources they are. Is it just one person who saying this or is it all three?"
206,"Yeah, I'm getting a bad vibe here.  I strongly get the feeling that he's rebounding on a convenient target.  The crush is probably in part because his ex and he just split.  And someone who's monogamous usually doesn't react well to polyamory.  That's 8 years of experience in a polyamorous household talking — a lot of people who were basically monogamous came into polyamory because that's where their desired partner was, but it didn't change the fact that poly made them miserable."

210,"You didn't have to dress him, you didn't have to bathe him, you didn't have to wipe his butt for him, all you did was check in on him to make sure he didn't fall down the stairs or something. You should ask your boyfriend why checking in on some one to make sure they aren't dead is ""inappropriate"" to him."
211,"Oh, no. This is so sad. A 23 year old man charmed a 16 year old girl into dropping out of high school and moving across the country from everything she knows, he handles all of the finances and is using ""it's gay"" as an excuse to not do the dirty work in parenting.

Dude. You're not going to see the red flags because he *partially raised you* and your values about adult relationships have been learned entirely from him. You were a kid when you got into a relationship with a grown-ass man and he was able to manipulate every part of the situation and probably even your thinking and behavior. It's not normal to think it's gay to change a baby's diaper, and maybe the other poster is right about him being abused in childhood. I'm more inclined to think he stormed off because that means he doesn't have to listen to you, but I don't know.

You need to speak with a professional, a therapist or maybe even a domestic abuse counselor, as there are some signs of financial abuse and I wouldn't be surprised if there's a lot you either aren't noticing or aren't telling us.  I'm not saying you're for sure in an abusive or unhealthy relationship, but a lot of the signs are there and it wouldn't hurt to get an educated outside perspective.

No matter what, you have a choice. You don't have to stay with him if you don't want to, please remember that if you should ever feel pressured for any reason to stay. There are a lot of resources out there to help you if you decide that separating from him is what's best for you and your baby, don't let your decision hinge on the financial aspect of your situation."
212,"So what exactly happens if Sarah is pissed off at you?  Does that make it considerably more difficult to get the stuff she is willing to do done?  Or is it just going to mean a lot of impotent glares?

Either way, just tell her ""It's my understanding that we need to do this, but I'm happy to check with [Manager] to clarify.""  Or ""Look, I know all this stuff's second nature to you, but I'm new here; I'd like to figure out how it all works in case the need does arise.""  Then just do it.  If she's afraid your enthusiasm will expose her laziness and make her look bad, that's her problem - and your manager really doesn't have to be delicate in pointing that out to her."
213,Yeah there is that undeniable fact. I can't claim I was perfect. Pregnancy hormones and the distress of most likely miscarrying made me very insecure. I'd keep saying maybe we should split etc etc and we almost did but after that I made huge improvements and we were back on track. 
214,Then he can go find someone else who wants sex too instead of issue ultimatums and breaking up.

217,"I think it's a bit odd how much emphasis you place on this girl being in a wheelchair (even putting it in the title).  It's kind of like ""well obviously I wouldn't cheat with *her*, she's disabled!""

Do you normally talk to female regulars without your girlfriend around?  If you weren't flirting, just talking, would your girlfriend be ok with it?

Because if not, then I think you should break up with her.  Not really because of this situation though-- more because your girlfriend is jealous and controlling."
218,"Unfortunately, it sounds like the bike ride has completely destroyed your girlfriend's trust in you.  I'm not sure why you're still texting this girl at work (unless these are leftover communications from before the bike ride), but if she feels the need to babysit you at work parties, that's a pretty strong sign this may be too far gone to fix.  And while you could look for another job, it doesn't sound like you really want to, and I'm not sure she won't harbor the same suspicions about the women at your new workplace.  You may just need to walk away and not make the same mistake in future."
219,I don't know what to believe anymore. He seemed very interested in me and never used me against her before. At least not that I know of.
220,"Unfortunately the issue is is that there are men out there that simply don't take that as an acceptable response, which is the issue OP is having.

Sorry OP, as a fellow asexual female that gets hit on a lot as well, there's no easy way out of it.  I simply tell them no, and if they start pressing the matter I tell them to leave before I call the police.  If I'm at a bar I will tell the bartenders that the guy is getting pushy about my 'no', and they're usually immediately ejected.

It's sad, but true: current social norms are that men think they deserve something other than a 'sorry, not interested' in this day and age, and think they're allowed to push the subject.

And, if you get the 'asexuality isn't real/can be cured by the right penis/is only a medical condition' spiel, just laugh and ask when he's going to get cured of his heterosexuality by the right penis as well.  It's honestly in the same line of offensive dialogue as telling homosexuals the same thing."
221,"Also, OPs BD could have a phalloplasty or other bottom surgery.

OP- before breaking up, I would have a frank and honest conversation with him. Ask if he's had surgery, what he's comfortable or not comfortable with, how he sees your sex life working, etc. Will it be uncomfortable and awkward? Certainly. But it will give you a better idea of whether or not you two are sexually compatible. "
222,"Fuck therapy, your wife is abusing, starving and assaulting your kid!! She belongs in jail, not therapy. Divorce her ass and protect your children. Ever second you force your daughter to stay with your wife you're supporting this abuse. Right now you're being a terrible parent too."

224,"That was my first thought.  If it really happened, Husband could have at least called (if his phone was dead, from another phone, or email, FB, etc.) to let her know there had been an incident at work. 

One of the reasons the hospitalization sounds so fishy is that the story is so out there and sympathy inducing that she would come across as a ""jerk"" if she questioned it."
225,"People are saying your parents are shitty - which may be true, no doubt that this situation is being handled poorly. But I just want you to know that it is not at ALL uncommon for parents to deny that their other child has been abusive or inappropriate, especially sexually, to their siblings. 

I was a foster parent for a couple years, I was the mentor of a girl who was 16 at the time, and came to me because her older sibling had been molesting her for many many years. 

Despite the sibling's own admissions, despite several intensive interviews and discussions with social workers and court officials, her parents waffled between never believing her and blaming her for anything that might have happened. 

I'm not shitting you when I say that her parents literally gave her to me - we had a court hearing to make me her legal guardian permanently until she became an adult - and they just agreed to let her come stay with me. 

My case is an extreme. However, it isn't at all uncommon in cases of incest - and while your situation doesn't approach the level of severity I'm talking about here, similar concepts are at play. 

It might be helpful to do two things: look up scientific/psychological literature and resources on abuse between siblings. You should very quickly find resources that discuss in detail 2 things:

1. Children very rarely make up stories about sexual abuse - it's kind of not within their experiential vocabulary. 

And

2. Parents often don't believe and blame the female child or victim - at least at first. 

In your sister's case - if she was trying to frame him for something, you'd think she would come up with something more incriminating or easier to defend. The fact that a teenage girl is willing to leave her bedroom and stuff to live in her older sister's house, to me, is huge evidence that something serious is happening. It might help to point out that she's not fooling around. 

However, I think that there's probably more to this story. If the step-brother is being creepy, I bet there have been other experiences that your sister isn't connecting. She might think they are inconsequential, she might think they are unrelated. I would sit down with her and ask her to think really hard about any time she's felt uncomfortable around the step-brother in the past, and write it all down. 

Hopefully you can present this to your parents and talk sense into them. If not, you'll need it. If you get social services involved, it's unlikely she will end up with you, because you'll need to be able to provide her with her own bedroom. Getting social services involved is the only way I know of to force your parents to pay child support unless you take them to court independently, and because your sister is a minor and the situation is abuse, I wouldn't be surprised if the courts got social services involved just to investigate. 

Anyway -- denial isn't okay. It must really suck for parents to have to choose between two children, but I'd much rather take precautions, lock doors, make it very clear that the boundaries are X and any violations of these boundaries is unacceptable, and then get us all into some family counseling. Not cool. "
226,"Sounds like PIV is always going to be a chore for her. Even if she uses the treatments she's given, I bet she's going to prefer heavy petting, dry humping, fingering, and oral sex over PIV.

If PIV is important to you and you can't live with that, just leave. It sounds like you already resent her and think that she owes it to you to treat a problem that isn't even *really* a problem unless she's just as upset as you are over a lack of dicking. And it doesn't sound like she's that upset.

So do you really want her to have sex with you in the way you want to have sex with her out of grudging obligation? That sounds super unsexy.

Just leave. Don't bring up her issues and the lack of PIV sex. You don't need to rub it in, and I bet you've already hurt her pretty bad when you told her that you'd leave if she didn't use the dilators.

You ""love"" a woman who doesn't exist: someone exactly like your girlfriend, but with a vagina that functions the way you want it to. Sorry, that isn't *really* your girlfriend.

It's like the people I see here upset because their partner won't do a specific sex act with them. Like, what's the best you think is going to happen? Either she's going to view the kind of sex you want as a chore, or she's going to hit her head and magically wake up one day as a new person who wants sex in the exact same way you want it. Well, here's a reality check: that second scenario is not going to happen. She's shown you that, repeatedly.

You can't meet her needs, and she can't meet yours. Time to stop the nagging, begging, and ultimatums and just leave.

But, for her sake, don't make her feel bad about her vagina on the way out."

And the ring-bearer was also 6. And he was neurotypical. And he literally did somersaults and handstands throughout most of the ceremony.

Also, at the time, I had a 4 year old brother and 2 year old sister. Neither of them were asked to be in the wedding, and it wasn't inappropriate for them to be excluded. No one owes anyone a spot in their wedding party, even if it would be nice to include everyone.

It is not cool that she didn't tell you or your wife before asking your daughter, though."

As for Joe, I think you and your husband should tell him your suspicions together.  I don't think you should confront Alice directly because it will give her time to cover her tracks.  Ideally, you just prod Joe into checking Alice's conversations with Christian and then just stay out of it.  I bet a lot of people will have varying opinions about this, but this is just how I would approach the situation I think.  "

242,"another thing to note is that it's better to report now, rather than wait till he makes a REAL move - which he almost certainly will, and it may be a situation that you can't control.  please don't allow him the opportunity.  he's *getting off* on your fear and hesitation and discomfort.  eventually, your discomfort when you move your legs away from his won't be enough to get him off.

if the school overlooks your (or your parents') report, and that real move happens, well, then the history is established and that will be a tasty fucking lawsuit.

but my hope for you is that you address this before it even gets that far, because you do not deserve to feel fear and anxiety as a result of this asshole, when you're just trying to *go to school*.

also, by the way:  this isn't just your general ""anxiety.""  anyone who tells you it is can kick fucking rocks.  you kept saying you didn't think anyone else would find this creepy - no, trust me, it's fucking creepy."

I can't see him thinking it's a step in the right direction, but sometimes you have to take step backwards before you can proceed....And as far as the money part goes, that's not a big deal to me.

There are a ton more like that. She's not fucking cheating on you dude, and you know it because you basically stalk her life. I wish she'd post here so we could tell her to find someone who actually trusts and respects her.

I know that's harsh, but fucking seriously, OP. Just stop. Leave her the fuck alone. Tell her to change her passwords/lock all her devices so you don't have the ability to read all her shit. Tell her all the crazy shit you've done trying to catch her in a lie. If, after you come clean, she wants to stay, great. You can work on not invading her privacy. But you need fucking therapy, dude. If you won't get it, you should break up with her for her own benefit. Dating you sounds exhausting.

248,"Not to mention she is a 16 year old teenage girl.  If things weren't already emotional end difficult enough at that point in her life, especially with issues dealing with parents, now she has another thing to process.

I think this just happened to be a ""perfect storm"" of things from the past coming up at this point in her life.  I think it will take some time for her to process all these facts and feelings, but in her own time and with family support and love she should be able to  get through this ok.

She has strong relationships built with all of you to fall back on which should help her understand that good people sometimes make bad decisions."
249,"First question: you said he's changed recently. Do you mean your marriage is otherwise no longer great, Tim is no longer loving and caring, or just that he's hanging out with this woman a lot?

Second question: Is he just driving her there, or is he staying for the duration of the surgery? A ride would not phase me, even given the background; I've driven coworkers to and from surgeries before.

I would not jump to saying he's sleeping with her or that she's having an abortion; it's possible, but it's a bit of a leap. But he is almost certainly cheating on you emotionally. Maybe that's all it is, but it's not nothing. Maybe he has a big old friend-crush on this woman; maybe he thinks everything is fine as long as he doesn't touch her, so he dismisses your concerns by telling you he isn't being physically unfaithful. That's not the issue. He's investing his time and attention in another woman, more than he invests in you, and it hurts you. Tell him so calmly and plainly. If your husband is really loving and caring, he will understand why that hurts you, and he will want to fix it. If he keeps minimizing the issue, then you've got a bigger problem. "

Uh, ok.  It's one thing to swoop in on a guy she asks you to back off on.  This is the opposite of that.  Tell her she's acting like a child and when she decides to not lie to you (which she did), and get mad at you for successfully being tricked by her, which you were, she can call you."

253,"Finish the break up properly and *move on*.

She wants to remove, specifically, the exclusive commitment aspect. If she were just pressured by parents she would redefine the scope of the relationship whilst assuring you that she is still your exclusive partner and that you can trust her on that. But instead, she declared you two are no longer partners. So, she does not commit emotionally or sexually to you. You cannot just decide on your own hand to commit either. That is not fair as it is much more likely she'll end up dating someone else who presents himself to her without your ""overcommitment"" baggage.

Which is the second point. You learnt a valuable lesson. No matter your feelings, proof of commitment must *always* be balanced between two partners. If you give more, you make turn off people who are not so sure or not ready. If they give more, they might turn you off because you're not sure you like them or not ready to commit emotionally. You gave more than her, and now you lost her. The big proof of love romantic gesture in the movies only works... in the movies! In reality, you only make big displays of affection when your partner doubts your feelings, not when they're overwhelmed by them."
254,"She wouldn't allow her small child to EAT (the fact that he mentioned the others eating makes me believe it was during proper meals, not snacks). I didn't check OP's comments yet to see if he elaborated on this, but no amount of therapy would help fix his crazy wife. "

Anyways, clearly you both need to immediately go together and tell you mother calmly and sternly about what happened.  Just lay out the facts and see what her reaction is.

If your mother seems to brush it off, stress that you are seriously upset about what happened and that while sibling rivalry is fine, your older sister being violent with you isn't appropriate.

As for your sister, she obviously knows what she did is wrong, hence why she is lying about it.  People learn from consequences, so let her get hers.  If she doesn't get in trouble for this, it just reinforces that behavior.

The more important question you should ask yourself is - do you really want to be with someone who lies about you negatively on the internet, guilt trips you when you call him out on it, and then acts like a child by ignoring you and passive aggressively baiting you afterwards?

He could (very unlikely...) be okay with it, he could say no and you move on, or the most likely option, he would be extremely hurt and it would either put a further rift in your relationship or end it completely.

Why do you jump to ""open relationship"" before ""improving my sexual relationship with my boyfriend""?

264,"It honestly sounds like everything was on Andy's terms. 

&gt; That he couldn't commit to a relationship now because he wanted to get his career settled but he thought I was the most wonderful woman he had ever met, a rare treasure, and he didn't want to lose me.

So, ""I'm going to do what's right and important for me, and I want you to be willing to bend over backwards for me."" If he was a decent guy, he would have taken you out to dinner and discus the future without you first. Instead, he broke up with you, then came running back three days later, at which point you would have been so relieved to have him back that you would have agreed to anything.

&gt; Andy told me he had never thought about marriage or children before but I made him want those things. 

&gt;  That even if I no longer loved him as a lover, that we would be best friends always. He said if I got cancer or pregnant he would even give up his dream and take care of me (a first for him.)

Talk is cheap.

&gt;  I even loaned money to Andy sometimes when he got in a jam (I never loan money) and he ALWAYS paid me back.

Until he didn't.

&gt; Sometimes he would disappear for days at a time without warning. He was also obsessed with his privacy and not talking about his past.

Red flag. You shouldn't have tolerated this for ANY length of time. In this day and age, everyone in the first world and beyond is connected. Everyone has a phone, everyone has access to a phone charger, and there's a billion and one ways to reach out to your loved ones at any time. The only way he was able to go off-grid for days on end, on a regular basis, was because he didn't care enough about you to keep in touch, and/or because he had something to hide. Maybe another girlfriend, maybe a wife, maybe a secret family.  

&gt; He was a step closer to completing his dream. He took me aside and told me he loved me deeply and dearly. That someday we'd be together forever. He had to get his career going, and once it was, I would move out there to be with him (a six hour drive from my current location).

Again, it's all about *him*. *His* career, *his* dream, and you then following him like a dutiful woman. What about your career and dreams? What about your plans? You're willing to uproot your entire life for a guy who ghosts you on a regular basis?

Talk is cheap. He sold you dreams about a life together with marriage and kids, he told you you were the most magical girl in the world, because it was easy to do so, and it got the reaction out of you that he wanted. He would say wonderful things so he could get away with just vanishing every so often and not telling you about his past. I'm sure he enjoyed your company, but based off your post, it sounded like he was only interested in how you could contribute to his life, not how your lives could compliment each other. It's all very well to say ""I will stand by you if you get cancer,"" but that doesn't mean much when he can't even return a phone call.

Give yourself time. Eventually, you'll get over him.

267,"Here is the thing, your joke isn't funny.  When you tell a rape joke in front of women it's like telling a lynching joke in front of a POC.  It is a disgusting and offensive reminder of just how priveleged and oblivious you are.  Its potentially very hurtful (as a rape victim I can say that I have definitely been reminded of being rapped by peoples 'humour', its not fun) and scary.  If you tell these jokes just among men you are contributing to rape culture.   Its like saying your not racist because you only tell racist jokes to other white people.  Its fucked up.  It doesn't matter why this was the last straw for your friend,  maybe it was because she saw how disgusted and uncomfortable it made her friend, maybe she was just sick of it.  I don't think you really understand the violence of what you say when you joke about rape.  For women its not funny, its fucking terrifyingly not funny.

Ifvyou want to make amends, read the 'open letter from the Standford rape victim'.  Read it, and then realize what comes in to women's minds when they here your joke.  Ask yourself if you think its funny.  Once you truly get that it isn't you are ready to apologize.   Write an fb message.   Have a femenist friend read it first.  

This 'why did no one say anything earlier' thing, move past that.  They didn't because it was awkward.   It doesn't matter because it is your responsibility not to be an asshole, that's on you.

I have mad respect for your friend group here.  You sound contrite and I wish I could be less angry, but I can't.  I am tired of rape culture and male privelege and all the things that contribute to sexual violence.  I am tired of having to explain it.   I hope this is a growth moment for you."
268,"It's not surprising that you're attached to the fetus already. That's what all the hormones in your body are designed to make you feel. I feel pregnant unexpectedly and was also surprised by those feelings. I listened to my head and got an abortion and it was the best decision I ever made. 

If you have this child, that man will have parental rights to him, like it or not. It's highly unlikely that he won't find out. It seems like a selfish idea to have this child knowing what kind of father it will have. Best case scenario it will have no father at all. 

You don't have to tell him, but I urge you to think with your head and not your hormones."
269,"My parents are a doctor and a lawyer. They have a wonderful marriage, they spent loads of time with me, they raised me really well, and we took lots of awesome vacations together. There was no ""nanny"" that raised me ffs. Please don't make statements that generalize a group of people out of pure jealousy or ignorance. "
270,"He probably misunderstood you and thought you were breaking up with him.

Alternatively he feels abandoned in a time of need. Straight after you called off the wedding you say 'after not hearing from him in a few days' which seems odd to me as if my fiancee was going through something like that I'd still keep frequent contact. 

You also didn't protest him labelling you as an ex. 

In fact the more I think about it the more I think you were way too distant about it all.

That said the girl could be a colleague, relative, whatever.

Contact him and talk."
271,"Something tells me your Ex isn't controlling at all. It seems like you have no problem ditching the lion's share of decision making squarely on her shoulders. 

*Not using a condom.
*Walking away from a conversation about YOUR baby.
*Blocking her!
*Sleeping with her when you didn't want a relationship with her, leaving it unclear what you wanted out of the relationship.

Someone has to navigate a freaking ship in a storm and you left it all to your exsauted Ex. This doesn't equate to controlling behavior. Sometimes it better to abandon the ship. Someone should tell this woman that. But she is incredibly brave for not giving up on you. Grow up and give her a break. I don't mean get back together with her. But you are going to be a dad. Your life isn't about you anymore. You think your ex is controlling but wait till you have a uncontrollable toddler on your hands. That is demanding. 
Go to therapy and learn how to be a better man."
272,"Oh boy. Is there a way to add this info back in about what he did when you stayed out late? Your post had my stomach go ""Oh dear"" but after reading that he locked you out of the house like a bad dog, my stomach is now saying ""This is really not good"".

Your husband may have not been ""that"" controlling before you married but your relationship and how your husband views you is in a VERY different scary place now.  In two months since you married, he has decided to tell you what clothes you can wear, where you can go, and how much sex you need to give HIM in order to make HIM happy. Thats not even touching the issue where he locked you out of the house.

 You say there are more examples and I am sure there are. I understand wanting it to ""work out"" but do you really want to see what else drastically changes in 2 more months? If you will even be allowed to work or see your friends at all in 6 months. This WILL escalate. Maybe not soon but it will, it's the nature of abuse.

Please tell someone you trust about what is going on and please find a therapist FOR YOU. You need to work with a trained professional and ask them if this relationship is worth working on or if you are in a dangerous relationship and need to get out for your own safety. I am almost 100% that a therapist will tell you that you are in an abusive relationship once they hear about what has transpired.

Be safe OP. Im really sorry this is happening."
273,"Thats exactly what he says, ""well we're married now so we can't just break up because you don't like something."""
274,"&gt; I have a dirty mind, mostly just lots of that's what she said jokes, and just basically worshiping his dick and giving him compliments on it. We have sex about once a week which is great for both of us. **He has a lower libido**  
  
You're affecting his self esteem as what you are doing can be construed as passive aggressive.  
If you were making 100 comments a day about buying/owning expensive things when your bf is a low-middle income earner it would play out the same."
275,"This is not complicated. Your mom fucked up and Mark almost fell off the bed. You ran in and saved the day. So mom latched onto this ridiculous accusation to cover up for her fuck up. The end. 

In the future, simply do not engage with crazy. When your mom or sister rage and scream, stay calm, speak up for yourself but do not raise your voice. If they won't stop screaming, leave. Do not allow them to act this way around you. 

Move anything important to your boyfriend's mom's place before you go on your trip, and move there when you return."
276,"Oh, it sounds like your friend knows.  The kids on medication, so clearly they sought help for his behavior problems.  Why not stay at a hotel?  Then when his behavior overwhelms you, you can retreat to the serenity of your hotel.  If you add in a babysitter and take you friend to the hotel and let her drink as much wine as she wants, you officially become the best godmother ever."
277,"And also tell her.. ""what if they only have tampons, and I have to choose between losing my virginity to a tampon or bleeding on my white skirt."" Or something like that.  Man here...not good at talking to girls...ever"
278,"I consider myself to have an excellent sense of humor and to be very open-minded. But if you ever said that in my home you would never be welcome there again. 

Apologize for being an asshole and laughing about the idea of a women being raped and never make a joke like that again. "
279,"Do I at least get points for hiding my jealousy fueled melt down till I was in my room?  In all seriousness, you are 100% right and I need to work on it.

I honestly hope he makes my Mom very happy."
280,"I want to tell her, but she constantly shuts me down when I have anything to say about her husband. She thinks he is being attacked by my family so it's difficult. But I will bring it up anyway because really, the wellbeing of my niece is more important to me than preserving a relationship with my sister..."
281,"I'm from a background of pathological favoritism also. It really fucked me up. I have spent a lot of time and money on therapy as an adult working on the damage from it. So I feel you, I feel you.  

In my case, I tried confronting my mother about it twice. She refused to apologize, and she certainly didn't change. The first time she just said, ""I wasn't the favorite child, either"" and then tried to make ME feel sorry for HER that she had a crappy childhood. The next time I tried to do it, she was gaslighting me and denying that things had happened. (She had gaslighted me before). So basically in my case, confronting her got me absolutely nothing. 

OP, you're almost out of there. You need to talk to your guidance counselor and your coach to get them to help you get into college. Do not expect anything from your mother at all. What you need to do is focus on your future. In my case, I moved far away from my dysfunctional family and got a world class education (sadly with a giant mountain of student loan debt).  It's unlikely that football will be your career (almost no athletes make it into professional sports); you should choose a major that will give you good opportunities. I would recommend computer science, engineering, or a hard science.  Go for a STEM major and make yourself a great life. 

I myself now live in a lovely home, in a beautiful city, with a really cool husband and two fabulous children, and the accomplishment I am most personally proud of is that I do not have a favorite child. My children both say that they feel they are both my favorite. "
282,Infantilizing? I'd say he is deliberately isolating her.
283,"I want to share a little story. Once, I dated this guy. He gave me lots of compliments and made me feel beautiful. In particular, he loved my ass. Like, he couldn't get enough of it. But one day, he told me that actually, my ass wasn't that great after all. It was alright, but he wanted it bigger and rounder. This wasn't a one off comment. From that point on, my body went from amazing to ""not good enough"". He started comparing me to celebrities and random girls on the internet. And I believed him. 

It hurt, but I told myself ""he doesn't mean to come off so mean"" and ""he's only trying to help me be better"". But you know what? He knew exactly what he was doing. To him, my self-esteem was just something he could tear down.

One thing I took from this is to never, ever allow somebody to damage the relationship you have with yourself. You have to live with yourself 24/7, and it shouldn't be spent in shame and inferiority. Anybody who doesn't respect your self-esteem is not worth your time. You don't accidentally, repeatedly tell a person you care for that ""your body is not good enough for me"".

Oh, and even if you had Kim Kardashian's ass, it still wouldn't be enough for him."
284,"I could see me accidentally starting to read some letter of my husbands past whilst cleaning.

285,"As a woman more than 10 years older than you, let me assure you that as time goes on, you will find that being true to your self and your feelings is going to bring you much more contentment than trying to fit some Maxim/Playboy magazine ideal of a ""cool girl who lets her man go out to strip clubs.""
 I promise."
286,"She wants some boundaries. She doesn't want to tell you everything. I realize that upsets you, but it's really quite normal, and unless you want to cause further damage to the relationship I suggest you respect that boundary.

I consider my mom one of my best friends. But there are things I don't tell her about. My finances. My sex life. Every little argument with my husband. Because they just aren't things she needs to know and I'm not comfortable sharing it. Fortunately I have a rational mom who respects that and would never be so dramatic to accuse me of betraying her over something like this. (Because yes, you are being irrational. You really are. And ridiculously dramatic. Your response to her does not sound like that of a grown woman.)"
287,"Man, all these posts are waaaaay off base, just because she likes talking to randoms doesn't mean she's sending nudes or looking for hook ups. 

Look, I do the same shit, hit up random kik threads and post my details to talk to random people when I'm bored. Why? To socialise like I'm doing right now on reddit. That's it. I talk to random strangers online because it's fun. You never talked to a random stranger online? Havent had a casual conversation with someone you're playing a game with? Made friends with someone you've never actually met in person? They have interesting stories, they're from different backgrounds, it's a good way to waste time.

On top of that, she's probably got friends on tumblr who follow her, I've got a bunch of friends following my tumblr who like and reblog my shit, tag me in posts that they think I'll like and ask me question. If I posted my kik say ""Im bored talk to me"" my friends would probably take that as an invitation to hit me up for a chat.

This is completely benign. I'm sure you telling her you googled her and snooped through her tumblr because you're nosey would go down like a bucket of lead balloons, though."
288,"&gt;I'm still unclear on this, I'm under the impression that she wanted me to make multiple phone calls?

That's not realistic.  You were respecting her words and actions.  She said you two were done.  You tried twice to contact her, that is enough after she said you two were over.

&gt;No clue.

Common thing.  People complain about what happened, but they don't come up with an alternative of the way things should have played out.

She is acting irrationally.  If she can't answer this question when you ask her, how in the world were you supposed to know what to do if even she didn't know.

This is her issue.  You handled it as well as you could have with the information you had at the time.

295,"Is it possible that during an end of the year party maybe she was assaulted? 

I did almost the same thing (except it was HS not college) after a senior party went poorly (for lack of a better word).

Talk to her about what's going on. Maybe a mini intervention? See if the bf knows what's up?"
296,"Unfortunately, you will probably lose your job no matter what you do. If you say something, as others have pointed out, the wife will not want you around. If you say nothing, the husband is going to come up with some reason (claim you stole or came on to him) to get the wife to agree to terminate you if you don't accept his advances. 

If you're in the States, you may have a sexual harassment claim if you are in a state that covers employers with only one employee. CA is such a state. If you are terminated, file a claim with your state civil rights agency. Many states will do an investigation and you can present your evidence to the investigator. Make sure you keep a password on your phone and back up the photo. You may end up with a settlement which will help tie you over until the next job. "

314,"I have a master's degree and worked in a contracted postal unit for a couple of years. Did some other jobs where a master's would make me overqualified too. I enjoyed getting my degree, but hated working in that field.

I find careers such as lawyers live to work, rather than what you chose to do, which is work to live. It can be difficult for live-to-work people to relate to a work-to-live mindset (until they get overwhelmed with work and stress).

Has the difference in your job statuses come up in conversation between you before? If not, bring it up soon. Be honest that you saw the messages -- on your own device -- and you realize it's a much bigger deal than you thought it was. Depending on the kind of law she practices, part of her career may involve socializing with a lot of lawyers and judges. When they all get together, they may foster an everyone-else-is-lazy attitude. Your gf may feel her colleagues will judge her to conclude she settled or is lazy herself. But understand this: the anxiety and insecurity about how to introduce you to colleagues and handle any snickers or fisheye glances is all hers, not yours. She needs to overcome this if she's going to be in a relationship with you.

When you talk to her about this, despite how much it might make you want to fold into a fetal position to realize she may look down on you, present yourself as a good catch that she's going to miss out on if she allows her insecurities to get the better of her. If she says she wants to try a relationship because she truly enjoys you (and your stress-free home life), know this may be a repeat issue for her that she has to work on, especially when interacting with professional colleagues and you in the same room."
315,"Eurgh OP, I totally sympathise. This is pretty much my worst nightmare.

Those who are all ""but think about the poor kids!"" completely miss the point. Yes, those kids are in a really shitty situation. But what won't help is a long-term arrangement teeming with a range of resentment levels. 

I am child-free by choice. I'm absolutely terrible with kids, and they make me incredibly anxious, regardless of whether or not I like them or want the best for them. It's your home, your sanctuary, and it now runs the risk of being the most stressful place on earth for you. 

It would be lovely if everyone instantly turned into a Mary Poppins-type when faced with children in a tough spot. But some of us just aren't make that way, and that's absolutely fine. The most selfless and brave thing to do in those situations is to be honest and remove yourself if need be. That's going to be better for everyone all round in the long run.

You do need to have a really good talk with your husband. He has a hell of a lot to deal with at the moment, but you both need to be absolutely clear where you stand. This is not what you signed up for: you have been clear that your definition of ""for better or worse"" does not include this sort of situation, and he seems to have understood that. 

People will undoubtedly call you selfish, because such is the curse of the child-free woman. But there's really only one selfish person here, and that's the SIL. Child-free people often most keenly understand that children are not commodities, and opting to not have any when you don't want them is the most powerful way of demonstrating that you understand their worth. People like SIL really make me mad. As if her kids are shoes that can be taken back to shop when they don't fit. Eurgh. "
316,"I was having a rough day at work and mcmoonspawn was being a jerk and bouncing on my bladder all day long and all I wanted to eat was a chicken parm sandwich.  I drove home, and planned to stop at the local cheesesteak place.  They were closed.  I went to another place, gone.  So I ended up at Subway, cause I was STARVING, and the week before had stopped selling it.  So I get a meatball sub and go home.  I'm sitting in the armchair, looking at this pitiful meatball parm from fucking subway, and my ex walked in, and asked me what I was eating.

I started sobbing.  Like full on snotty sobbing and somehow got across the point that everything was terrible and could never be right again without a chicken parm sandwich.  He went and got me a proper chicken parm sandwich, and ate the meatball parm that had a bite out of it.  Poor guy.  "

'I trust, but..' means you don't trust him. Was he on/off whilst you were together?

You obviously don't have to become friends with her, tell him you're not comfortable with that. However, a lot of people don't like being told who they can't be friends with so keep that in mind if you're thinking of asking him not to."

Also realize though that he might have kept silent through the whole planning process for a reason and it's okay for you to ask him what the reason is but be careful not to do it in an accusatory way. He doesnt need to feel like this is his fault. "
326,"Your sister has the rigth to cut off contact and to not forgive you. The most respectful thing is to accept this. Respect her boundaries.

However, regarding your edit that you have decided to continue avoid family gatherings and decline the invitation to vacation with your parents, you should give it some more thought. You sister has decided to have no contact with you and you have decided to rsspect that, now leaves figuring out how you ate going to manage seperating your life considering you're still part of the same family. You seem to consider the only respectful option to be to ostracize yourself from you family. But this cuts you off from almost all of your support network and many positive influences in you life. Respecting your sisters decision is good, but martyring yourself helps no one, including your sister.

Consider alternating holidays, vacations, family gatherings, and such between going and not going. Be clear that on the turns you are not going, you are absolutly not going and that asking you is just making the situation more difficult. Also be clear that on the tirns you are going that your sister has to be made aware of it well in advance (by someone other than you, obviously) and that no one is to pressure your sister to be there. You can still be a part of your family, it's just going to be a smaller part and it will require good communication, respect for boundaries, cooperation from the rest of the family, maturity and no resentment or feeling sorry for yourself. It takes work, but it is possible."

Yes, I do. My self-perception is pretty skewed, so I take pictures of myself to just see how I look. That might be weird....but who cares.
A lot of women that I know take nude pictures and they don't send them.

Well, you were. And if you want to talk to her about that, you are going to have to be honest about the fact that you looked through her stuff without her permission.

328,"Please, please understand how bad a 580 credit score is. If you have delinquent credit cards past 90 days late, that is the financial equivalent of having declared bankruptcy. Meaning it will take you seven years for your credit to recover. You'll be 32. Think about all of the things you want to do between now and your 32nd birthday. Do you want to buy a house? A car? You might not even be able to get a cell phone plan with that kind of credit. It might be hard to turn her in, but you absolutely have to, immediately. 

Also, since these cards are in your name, call and cancel them right now and report fraud to those companies. That'll get the ball rolling - unfortunately even when it's very obviously not your fault, these types of disputes often take ages to resolve. So you need to get on it ASAP."

All sarcasm aside, dicking around your house all day Sunday is not a plan. It's what you do in absence of actually having plans. It's also unbelievably uncool for you to pressure her to not work because as a 20 year old there's no way she doesn't need the money. Your financial concerns are important enough to justify changing/cancelling weekend plans, but hers aren't? That's fucked. 

You're 30 and you've been dating this girl for half a year and you're already talking marriage, pressuring her to make unwise decisions regarding her finance/job, and complaining when she doesn't automatically fall in line with your desires. Soooooooooo many red flags."

337,"i'm going to take a different approach than the others, because this is so fucking out of order that the first thing i thought of when reading it is that perhaps your husband was molested (by a male) as a child.  that is literally the only reason i can think of - assuming in all this time your husband has given no indication that he's backwards and frankly stupid - that he would view diaper changing of a male baby as ""gay"".  not to mention become angry with you when you insist otherwise, and likewise not have an issue with YOU (as a woman) changing and nursing him.  if he were simply saying ""changing diapers is gross,"" i wouldn't be jumping to this possibility (i'd be grabbing my pitchfork due to him being a lazy father who expects you to do all the 'gross' work), but he's saying ""it's gay,"" and that implies some history (or stupidity).

if you are 100% certain molestation is not a possibility, then i'm sorry to say, your husband is backwards and stupid.  how you deal with that, i have absolutely NO idea.

if you think (or know) that molestation is / might be something that happened in his childhood, then i would urge you to - instead of approaching this from a surface level (insisting on equal care of the baby) - you drill down to the source and urge him into therapy."
338,"So your sister has apologized and begged you to come. But that's not good enough? 

Frankly it seems 50:50. You snubbed her invitation, she got upset, you sulked, she made some barbed comments, you threw your toys out of the crib and announced you weren't coming to the wedding, she apologized. Right at this point you are sitting in the sand box pouting. 

Jeez, you are so determined to be right. Other people don't seem to mean anything to you. I'm amazed your gf is sticking around at this point."
339,"Agreed.  If you know the name of the organization she works for or her job title, I would call and ask to speak to her supervisor or someone in HR, depending on how big the organization is.  Make it abundantly clear that you are not a drama queen trying to stir up trouble and that you are contacting them in the strictest of confidence.  Be clear that you are not trying to get anyone in trouble, but given your mother's professional responsibilities, your conscience would not allow you to live with yourself if you didn't at least let someone know something of her history.  Don't worry about proof and all that.  If this is an organization that deals with physically or developmentally disabled children, they are no strangers to abuse and how underreported it is. Just speak respectfully and from your heart.  Be prepared to give as many details as necessary to make clear your concerns.    

After it's done, wash your hands of your mother once and for all.  You've done all you can for her would-be victims.  The rest is up to her employer.  You don't need to worry about your mother tracing any of future work events back to you.  After all, you don't know what they are going to do or how long it will take (and you absolutely should not ask).  This much is certain.  Her employer isn't going to say anything to her about your call because it would set them up for a lawsuit if they did later fire her for any reason.  If at some point they do let her go, they will have
their own justification 
 for doing so."
340,"I don't know why you would want to preserve this friendship other than avoiding work drama. Dude does not respect you or your wishes. That's not called being a friend. Also, you should probably not become BFFs and romantic partners with your co-workers. "
341,"&gt;Where do we go from here?

We?!?

Why would you EVER stay with someone who spat in your face?

This guy is a creep preying on a very much younger girl. The only blessing is that he showed his true colors before he got you to move in with him. "
342,"OP, you did what you thought was right and tried to warn your friend.  She didn't listen.  So my advice is to now stand down and avoid trying to tell your friends circle what he's really like.  This may sound weird, but maybe pick one thing to say to the friends that makes it clear he's a user without going into detail.  Maybe something like ""I loaned him $xxxxx.xx and he refused to pay me back.""  People relate a lot easier to being screwed over financially than to being manipulated to give up your autonomy. But they might start watching his actions more closely."
343,"This is the perfect response. Id almost consider adding, ""Thanks for letting me know so we can use your ticket for someone else."""
344,"Channel your Southern Lady.  Be sweetness. This is a good time to have the velvet glove and iron fist. Whatever you do, don't lose your cool."
345,"We're not saying that's a *fair* way to think, we're saying it's *typical for a teenage girl to think*"
346,"&gt;I never felt uncomfortable before and haven't even minded when he's stayed at her place. She lives in a different state. He frequently travels there for work and he makes it a point to always visit her.

OH. COME. ON. This, combined with her ""Hey, look at me loving up on another man ;)"" and all that other behavior, just...come on, dude."
347,"Yeah, her interpretations are ridiculous given that she's thin and works out.  

&gt; I think he's trying to motivate me  
  
Motivate her to what exactly?  Grow bigger boobs?  
  
He's clearly trying to shame her &amp; keep her confidence low so she doesn't feel secure in leaving him."
348,"Wait, what??????  

This is unbelievable. He basically just said that because you're still alive your assault wasn't that big of a deal. The minor inconvenience of locking the door is a bigger deal to him than protecting you from assault."
349,"If you're American, you must have seen the news out of Chicago about the young woman who was stabbed to death for saying she wasn't interested in a guy, right? Not saying he or all men who don't respect women or boundaries have the potential to assault but this guy clearly feels entitled to this woman to a disconcerting degree. And I kinda feel like if your gut is telling you something you shouldn't ignore it, this guy sounds unhinged. 

Edit: cannot spell feels, apparently "
350,"The fact that she is autistic, opinionated, etc. are irrelevant.  She likes you, you don't like her.  So let her down easy, maintain casual but limited communication, and continue to be her friend if possible."
351,"OP, please don't go too far down the rabbit hole with this cheating theory until you've actually talked to her.  While it's a possible explanation for her behavior, it is by no means certain!  So don't approach it in an accusatory manner.  Definitely don't name a particular guy as the suspected partner."
352,"They are treating you like their mom because you're acting like their mom. Stop buying them groceries, driving them around, badgering them about doing chores. Just take care of yourself. No more of this ""shared groceries"" bullshit. Everyone should just buy what they need for themselves."
353,"&gt;  think about why you were okay dating this guy for as long as you did.

Exactly. Seems like she should've dumped his ass a long time ago."
354,"Sleeping with your housemates isn't a good idea, anyway. When shit gets rough you're out a home or end up with issues like this one. At least you can learn from this experience."
355,"The title alone is enough to warrant leaving. But, if you really want to go through this...

&gt;screaming and yelling, breaking things, breaking and knocking down doors, and harming/cutting himself in front of me. 

Even one of those alone would be cause for serious concern. As it is, all of them should point to an immediate breakup. 

&gt;I am constantly walking on eggshells around him, and even the smallest thing will set him off. 


This is not a healthy way to live. This is not the *right* way to live. 


&gt;A few weeks ago, we got into a fight and it led to him getting his gun and threatening to kill himself. 

Let me guess, he's never been to therapy. 

&gt;I said I would call the police, and he threatened to shoot me too. I immediately cowered in fear and shut my mouth. 

HE FUCKING THREATENED TO SHOOT YOU


&gt; This is not where our problems end, however. We have had a dead bedroom for basically the entirety of the relationship. 

After him *literally threatening to shoot you*, your sex life should be the least of your concerns. 

&gt;drug use, hiding money from me, even wrecking my car and hiding it for weeks. 

...why in the world are you still with them? Also, how did he hide *your* wrecked car for weeks?

You are in an incredibly abusive relationship. You're 23. You have many happy years ahead of you if you leave him. If you stay, you will be miserable, you will be scared, and you will quite probably **die**. "
356,"Remember,  vacations don't count without pictures posted on social media every step of the way.

357,Um...don't fuck that lady?
358,"I... I fucking... he watched *porn* at *her grandfather's funeral*.

How was *that* not the straw that broke the camel's back?
"
359,"What is *wrong with you?* You are standing by and doing *nothing*. when you can prevent a child being abused! If she gets custody and ships him of, when (if) he comes back, I hope he tells you every ounce of the abuse he suffered so that you can know all the hurt you could have prevented and *didn't* because it was *haaard.*"
360,"&gt;How can I get married and buy a house with this huge elephant in the room?

You don't, period. First of all, as others have said, children or no children is deal breaker, there's no way to compromise. You can't have children for just a bit to try or anything like that. You can't wait forever for your bf to change his mind, he will string you along and never do it.

Second of all, now that you are about to be single, once you start dating again, please do NOT even think about buying a house with someone you are not married to. Sometimes that sort of deal can be more complicated than a divorce."
361,"Send him some of the research.  Unfortunately, I have found in my experience that people who believe things are valid because it was the way they were raised/what they know consider themselves to be all the research they need.  Also, based on my personal experience, if you ask about other parenting ideas (authoritative vs authoritarian or even parenting expectations/roles), you may gain more insight.  It is definitely a deal breaker for many people."
362,[removed]
363,You did the right thing. He's just trying to hurt you because you rejected his manipulative bullshit. Never believe what someone tells you about you to make themselves feel better.
364,Lmao  are you guys trying to come off as psycho? Yea showing up to someone's surgery unannounced seems like a great idea. I'm sure the person waking up from surgery will really appreciate having a stranger there in a room full of potential tension.  Great idea!!
365,"Because passing the decision off to his pre-teen kids is asking for resentment. It's their decision how they want to feed their kids, not the other way around. "
366,"I can absolutely understand he feela differently than I do. What I cannot understand is what he feels or why.

One day he thinks I lied about infertility to trap him into fatherhood. That says both that he doesn't trust me and that he does NOT want kids.

The next he says we should try for another baby. That requires sex, and says he DOES want kids.

Day after that he says he has no interest in sex right now.

Then the following day he's trying to iniate sex.

I'm lost. I can't empathize with ""I didn't want kids you liar, except I do, except I don't want sex, hey wanna fuck?""

I've tried to talk to him. I can't get anything concrete or consistent as an answer.

If he said that he realizes he wants kids after all, I may not agree but could empathize. That, we could talk about. Maybe we would agree to break up, but we could come to SOME resolution.

But how can I understand and empatize with 5 different and conflicting viewpoints that change each day?"
367,"While I strongly, strongly disagree with infant circumcision (I'm Jewish, and I wrote a paper on why infant circ is wrong), it's a lot more than aesthetics at play here. They may truly think that they cannot accept their grandson because of their religion. So it's upsetting and disappointing, but it's not just ""oh I don't like the look of that."" Not that it necessarily makes the outcome different, but it requires a different approach."
368,"How is it his house if you make all the money and the house is in your name?

Lady, it's sounding more and more like you married a control freak loser by the minute. "
369,"Either this guy hasn't got two brain cells to rub together in his skull, or he meant to cause you pain and humiliation by telling you that he thinks about the women he sees in his day-to-day life when he masturbates and when he's with you. Deliberate cruelty is a perfectly dumpable offense in my book. Also, he tried to go for a threesome in the moment with *your best friend*. Skeevy."
370,"Also, no one should ever apologize for something they're not sorry for."
371,"Your wife chose her friend over you, first of all. Second of all, how can you *ever*  trust your wife again? I mean, this is some excessive lying to cover up the fact that she's spending time with the friend. 

Just...move out. Your wife doesn't prioritize your marriage anymore. Stop the charade and get on with your life."
372,"He wants you to stay dependent on him.

  He bought you alcohol when you couldn't.  Did he contribute to your drug habit as well?

Also, were you into all that when you started dating him, or did it start after?"
373,That's pretty intense. You definitely need to report it and let her know for her own safety. 
374,"OP, I'm glad you're content with this outcome, and moving in with your mum seems like the safest option for you. But please, only live with her for so long as benefits you. She has failed you in so many ways that she can never undo. You owe her nothing. She sacrificed your childhood to save herself. 

Keep yourself safe for now, and take the safety she's offering, but not give her a future she hasn't earned."
375,"Stand up to your mom, you're a grownup. Why is she even privy to the details of your trip?"
376,"I get that, but it's hard to separate insult from banter when you are always on the receiving end and never on the giving end.  It might help to think back to when you all started getting into sports.  Your girlfriend is 24-years-old, but athletically, she is effectively the same age as you all were back then.  I don't know if I would have stayed with sports very long myself if people with 20 years more experience than me generally talked shit to me and only occasionally offered support.  If all playing want your GF involved, then they need to put on the kid gloves with her a bit.  It's really not that hard or unnatural to throw some support her way while still talking shit to everyone else."
377,Just read the update...he was jealous that you were sleeping with his friend.  Do you really think he wants a poly relationship?  I doubt it.
378,And yet he was still asking about her long after the date he went on. Long into your relationship.
379,Do you keep a younger vulnerable woman in your house and do you refuse to let her go?
380,"&gt;We both have younger siblings my brother is 11 and her sister is 12

So how many years are you betting till they end up together?"
381,Have your pay checks go into an account that's just under your name. Then put whatever amount you feel comfortable with him taking in the joint account.
382,"""Dude, let me make it clear. You may believe that what you are doing is good for me, but it isn't. If you do it again

1. I will break up with you.
2. I will call the cops and get you arrested for assault
3. Then I will pack my stuff and leave.

It is time you learned about something called consent.""
"
383,I would say this the mid way point of the horror movie.
384,"&gt;However, when you're trying to cook dinner for your family and your husband is so adamant about needing meat that **you have to cook two separate dishes**

First of all, this is factually incorrect; they each cook their own dinner. Second, mom is NOT some kind of a victim here. She's making a unilateral change in her lifestyle after 12 years of marriage, one which most people wouldn't be on board with and, indeed, none of the other members of her family are particularly on board with it, so she's trying to dragoon the rest of her family into changing their diet against their wishes with a campaign of passive-agressiveness. "
385,"Grown ups goes to Disney parks by themselves all the time.  I don't see what the big deal is going there without the kids.  I get that you're trying to be a good dad, but there's no way this is going to end well.  The way I see it you're going to hurt your ex either way.  If you tell her how you're going to propose or if you do it in front of her it will all end the same way.  "
386,I would have lasted 2-3 of these arguments before i actually would have moved on. Kudos for being this patient and sticking out this long. Be happy that you were finally able to get outta there.
387,"My therapist actually does do that, just a bit more sedately."
388,"Actually, yeah. Pregnant lady here (22 weeks). My female cat who normally wants nothing to do with me has appointed herself as a professional belly warmer since right before I found out I was pregnant. My male cat who is normally semi-permanently attached to me currently won't come anywhere near me and has attached himself to my husband for the time being. Weirdness."
389,"So to me, seeing a movie and then fucking isn't a FWB thing. That's dating AND sleeping together. You want to date other guys and fuck them. Please don't start out by saying that or you will lose him immediately. "
390,"Glad I am not the only one to catch his use of quotation marks. Typically, that would mean that the other party was twisting the truth. Not so much."
391,"&gt; edit: Wedding if off all together, we broke up that's that

Umm... Can we get more details on this?"
392,"Exactly! I was going to say the same thing! I would lie. Then once it's done, he can say he never stopped thinking about you and he knows you are the love of his life, etc. and you got back together. God forbid you two break up after he made all these changes. Your relationship doesn't need that kind of pressure. Thinking you owe him or obligating each other to stay together if you ever started falling apart. Lie is best."
393,I work in a school too. The years of requirements... the money I've sunk into training... the constant effort of scrubbing my personal life and media presence... this is not a small thing in the big scheme of things.

395,"My advice to you is to get your child support order in first so it can take precedent over orders 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, before he runs into inability to pay.

I would not make the mistake of thinking that I am kidding. Tone is hard to read over the internet. I am very, very, serious."
396,"I think you are still incredibly blind to how severe this guys behavior was. 

He wasn't just a jerk; he was ABUSIVE. You were in an abusive relationship. 

Hell, I was in an abusive relationship and he never made me bleed and go to urgent care. 

Please don't move on to the next guy who abuses you in a different way."
397,"The thing your sister did with the mosquito on your forehead was immature... but then again your sister is probably fed up with lectures and ""pep talks"" which (I'm guessing here) she probably finds insufferable.

Accept that you and she have very different temperaments and priorities in life. Stop trying to ""fix"" her."
398,"&gt; Am I the only one who regularly got into fist fights with my siblings as a child? .. They were kids, this shit happens. 

You really don't understand the difference between standard sibling fighting/wrestling and ""I ended up punching her in the face and a kicking her stomach with my knee"" as retaliation for something OP was pissed off about?  Seriously?

Yeah, I grew up play-wrestling with my sister but there would have been HELL TO PAY if I had punched her in the face in true anger.  "
399,"This does not sound like a healthy relationship. He cheats, he lies, he has been physically and verbally abusive. You deserve better and you should get out before he has the chance to hurt you again.

Loveisrespect.org is youth-targeted but has good resources on how to recognize and get out of abusive situations, and they have 24/7 counseling available if you want to talk to someone in the interim before your new insurance kicks in. "
400,"It's a traditionalist thing. The man needs to work to make sure that the woman is happy. The man's happiness comes purely from making the woman happy. This was partly fair in times and places where women didn't work, or didn't work high paying jobs, but some people still hold to these believes even if the woman makes more than enough money for herself now. 

This was a fairly wealthy woman who stuck to traditional views of men vs women. In her logic, the fact that she makes enough money to support herself is irrelevant. He is still the man and she is still the woman, so she had to be taken care of by him.

I'm not claiming all Chinese or Asian women are like this, because they're not, but they are generally countries that stick more to this traditional view. I can confirm this with a Singaporean ex of mine who was significantly more wealthy than me, but she still expected me to pay for *everything*, whilst even sharing a joint was difficult for her because ""it was hers"". 

Tl;dr: It's a tradition that shouldn't apply anymore, especially not when the woman is making enough money herself."
401,You could just say it was a false positive or something like that.
402,"I brought that point up to him 3 months ago when we were having the first argument. I calmly told him that he ""was being a selfish asshole"" and he said he knew he was."
403,"I just want her to snap the hell out of it. She could have a nice life, a husband and kids if she just realized what she's doing."

406,"He also wrote this toward the end of the post: 
&gt;  She also hates that Sara knows our whole situation, rules, and that this happened while I was drunk and Sara was sober.

And after some questions here, he spoke to his wife about whether she felt he was taken advantage of and then wrote, 
&gt; I've now learned that Sara has been involved in two other scenarios like this, and one of them ended in divorce. I knew of the non-divorce scenario but not the details or how Sara was involved. My wife thinks this is her thing, like a power situation.

After reading that, it sounds like her question was her *confirming* that what they just did was in fact against the rules. Sounds like she's a predator causing trouble in their friends/swinger group."
407,"Your name's not Carrie, is it?

I'm so terribly sorry your mom is projecting her insecurities about her body and the fact you're growing up on to you.  Just do your best to reassure her that you have your priorities in order, and prepare yourself for pushback as you become more independent."

Oh good, because if you weren't on law review, my advice would be different.

&gt;I am also far more outgoing than he is, comes from a much wealthier background, objectively better looking and have a considerably larger friend group than he does. He acknowledges all these factors

You made him acknowledge all this? Did you make him sign a form or something?

&gt;To make matters worse, several of my friends have pointed out that we seem like an unlikely pair/unevenly matched.

And here's the real kicker. The truth is you're embarrassed by him and if I had to guess, you're probably not too keen on introducing him to classmates/ work functions. But have you considered whether he'll be happy when you're billing 100-hour weeks?

Also you're definitely a narcissist. "
409,"With that attitude, you'll never make new friends, much less find a partner."
410,"If r/relationships has taught *me* anything, it's only if you're kind of an abusive jerk while also being old. Sexy!"
411,"Why do you assume it's all cause of Sara? You know your friends could have been biting their tongue a long time on this, maybe never liked it but let it slide, and are now fed up? In fact, that strikes me as more likely than how you seem to perceive the situation."

414,"Asymptomatic shouldn't stop her from transmitting it to OP though, since they don't use condoms. "
415,"It bothers me to see children being forced to live their lives at their siblings level. I remember a scene from Little House on the Prarie where Laura Ingles and her other sister wanted to walk, but couldn't because it would be unfair to their blind sister [don't remember her name.] That always struck me as a great example of parents trying to be fair but failing. 

The daughter is going to need to be around people alone, a lot of the time. The brother is going to need people to handle his issues and it is not the job of the daughter to give up her childhood, or life, for a child she didn't ask to have. The daughter is seven, old enough to be at an event without both her parents there. 

I am sure, if Op feels that he cannot go, then he can have the daughter go without issue. 

Op needs to start thinking about the big picture. What happens when his daughter hits school age and wants to go out with friends. Are they going to tell her no unless her autistic brother comes along? Nope. That is unfair. 

The daughter should not have to give up rewarding experiences because she has a low-functioning brother. It would be like telling a talented athlete they could not participate in sports because their sibling is in a wheel chair. 

Op needs to start thinking about what happens when his son is no longer small. Who will take care of him when they are too old to do this? "

417,"You: Sam, can I talk to you about something that's been bothering me?

Sam: Sure?

You: I want to start by saying that I want to talk about this to make our relationship better, and not to make you feel bad. Also, it would be helpful if I could finish speaking before you reply.

Sam: Okay?

You: I feel belittled when you say things like [insert examples here]. It seems petty to mention at the time, but over 5 months, these comments have built up into a resentment in me. I understand that it's probably just the way that you interact with people, and that you don't mean harm. BUT it would improve our relationship for me if you would cut it out.

Sam: Fine, whatever.

**Fast forward to restaurant scene**

You: It's really cold in this restaurant (puts on a jacket).

Sam: Can you not complain?

418,"Wow. You punched the cat to death? Are you 100% sure it's dead and not just unconscious or sleeping?

Take it to the vet at least first before you declare it dead."
419,"You're right, there isn't middle ground and it isn't normal.

Your girlfriend has serious issues with insecurity and jealousy. I'd lay money on her also having serious issues with anxiety. Part of the problem is that you've been together since you were 15- it sounds like she hasn't really emotionally grown past that point, and the dynamics in your relationship have become set.

This isn't healthy. You know this isn't healthy, and the fact that she's turning it around on you is a sign that it's not something she's going to work past. 

Going on a break is a good idea. If I were in your shoes, I would require her to seek professional help for her insecurity and controlling behavior while separated. Set a timeline (even if you don't voice it to her- two weeks, maybe?) where if she hasn't taken steps to seek professional help by that time (and not you making appointments for her, her making her own appointments), the break becomes a breakup.

424,"""so it seems like I'm not just your regular intern-to-shag.""

Nah. It's a fuck-ton creepier and a passive-aggressive ""fuck you"" to your Dad."
425,"No, she probably couldn't. She seems fundamentally incompatible in every way with an adult relationship. I mean, she uses people, she's completely lacking in self-awareness and emotional intelligence, and basically has nothing to offer anyone. I don't see where you get this idea that if she just tweaked her behaviour a little, she could have a good life. Everything about her is the complete opposite of that."
426,You can warn her employer without proof. They might at the very least keep a close eye on her if they do hire her.
427,God I have no sympathy for your situation. You're making excuses for a woman who is TELLING you her plans to abuse her child.... get a fucking clue?
428,She lives overseas now so no worries about that. 
429,"&gt;They are the fruit of our marriage.

They are not your marriage though.  Your marriage is between you and your wife.  You celebrate the kids with their birthdays and father's/mother's day.  

Something my parents used to do is they go out to dinner, leave us some money for takeout, but then we all have dessert together when they get home."
430,"This is why your fiancee is upset with you. 

Your reason for getting a cheaper ring isn't because your priorities have changed, and because you'd prefer to spend the money on your future together, which is 100% valid and proves your commitment to her. 

You're spending less on the ring because you're afraid of getting burned again, and because you don't want to be out $3500 in case you two broke up. 

This isn't like a pre-nup where you're making sure that both yours and your fiancee's interests are protected, and making sure you treat each other fairly in the event of a divorce. 

This is you blatantly telling your fiance that she's not worth the risk of an expensive ring like your ex was. "

By doing what she did, perhaps the aunt was the advocate the daughter needs. Someone who doesn't want her to be held back because of her brother. Sometimes who wanted to give this little girl a day to shine without being overshadowed by her brother or without missing out because of her brother. 

&gt; You can take steps to keep son from ruining the affair, and get him out of there fast if he has a meltdown

If this child is anything like my brother at that age? By the time you get him out of there, the damage is already done and the sister's wedding is already ruined. 

&gt; Honestly, OP's sister needs to recognize that OP's family is a package deal. 

So because one child in the family is unable to sit through a wedding without having a screaming meltdown and won't enjoy the experience, the child who can handle a wedding and would love to go and be involved should miss out? "
433,"I'm not going to tell you to leave her now, but I'm definitely going to say that you shouldn't be moving in with her after a few months *especially* when you are discovering massive issues like this as you do so.  It's fine if you want to stay there every night, but I really wouldn't recommend getting rid of your place until she's shown that she's able and willing to keep her place at basic levels of cleanliness (and until you two actually know each other past the honeymoon period)."
434,You might have a point. Last year he asked me to put in a good word for him with Claire because there was a promotion to grab. I told Claire that Jack told me to tell her that he's interested and ready. He didn't get the promotion although he was promoted six months later to a different position.
435,oh for the love of GOD. NONE of this was your fault. Nothing was stopping Mitch from explaining that you forgot about the holiday except his own defeatism. What is Mitch's health issue?
436,"I highly doubt the honesty of that statement.

Have you tried telling him this opened relationship no longer works for you and you want it to end?"
437,"Also ""I'm a slow learner, according to my husband."" Way to neg. 

I wonder if he's also ""the best person she's met"" according to her husband as well."
438,"One day you'll learn how to separate the kinks that turn you on from the same situations that make you feel bad. Or not. If you don't it probably will turn you into a repressed and stressed person.

439,"this is so important for women to hear!  maybe I'm a little slow but I just figured this out at 30.  I work part-time even though my husband can support us and even if taxes eat it away to almost zero just so I a) have something to say when people ask ""what do I do"" b) have that professional outlet and c) avoid a gap in my resume (until babies I guess) "
440,"&gt; We think it might have happened when she had an infection and was on some antibiotic medication because apparently that affects the effectiveness of birth control but she's really not sure.

Yeah, antibiotics can affect the pill, but remember that the pill isn't 100% effective.

&gt;  I told her she should get an abortion

You don't just tell someone to get an abortion. You can express your opinion but your language should be considerate of the fact that the fetus is in *her* body and therefore the choice is *hers*.

&gt; She seemed really disappointed with how I reacted but how did she thing I would react?

Perhaps she thought you would be a little more considerate of her feelings too. 

&gt; i just don't get why she refuses to have an abortion when it makes the most sense in her situation.

Because she doesn't want to? Just because it's your preferred course of action, doesn't mean it has to be her's as well. 

She's already told you that she's willing to have this baby without you. Leave her if you want to but do not try to pressure her into having an abortion that she doesn't want because you have no right to do that. "
441,"TELL YOUR MUM, YOUR DAD YOUR HUSBAND AND KICK HIM OUT he's a fucking creep"
442,"Jesus. People aren't even considering what the actual problem is here. The brother is injured but (overall) okay now. The issue is that OP's fiance wants to postpone the wedding so the brother can attend. Not because he is currently hospitalized. Not because he needs full care. Because she wants him at her wedding.

That's fine, but she (and 90% of the people here) are forgetting that by postponing the wedding she is making it so many of OP's family probably will *not* be able to attend his wedding--*and* lose money in the process. So what the wife (and, again, most of you) are saying is that the woman's brother's attendance is more important than the money and attendance of OP's family.

It sucks that he can't attend this weekend. It would suck more if OP's family can't attend because they used their vacation time and money on a weekend that nothing happens on, and then can't attend in the future. I say continue the wedding. Set up a live feed so the brother can watch it as it happens. "
443,"&gt; This is frankly amazing that she'd go to that effort.

Story time! 

One of my best friends from college ""slighted"" his mother some how at his wedding. He did nothing, she's nuts. Anyway for Xmas she mailed them a box of rocks. Like filled a box with rocks, drove in to town and FedEx ed it to him.  I'm still amazed at the dedication. 

Edit: I remember what she was pissed off about! So my buddy and his then fiance lived/rented a house his parents owned. They lived out of state, and when they came for the wedding she expected my friend and his faince to go stay in a hotel, and let them have the house. His fiance and him was not all about that as all their stuff was there, and they were getting married a block over."
444,Oh my goodness. I'm so sorry! Have you tried asking his friends or family for any insight on what's happening here?
445,A credit card is not money in your own bank account. It's still something he controls 100%. He can cut it off at any time on a whim. Ensuring that you have zero independence. Money in your own bank account that he has no access to is yours. It gives you safety and independence. If your husband is unwilling to make you feel safe and financially secure then you have a major problem on your hands.

If people ask why you broke up, don't tell them how many guys she slept with. Why would you share that with friends? That is private between you and her. If she wanted other people to know, she would have told them."
450,"You and this other girl need to get together and take this to the principal/counselor/form tutor and your parents. Being tenured is irrelevant. This man is a predator. He has done this before, probably many times, and this may not be the first time he has been accused.

Just do what he does and tell them, maybe invite them up for a weekend so they can see it's not all 'shovelling manure'."

457,"From the Gone Girl monologue:


&gt;She’s a cool girl. Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she’s hosting the world’s biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because Cool Girls are above all hot. Hot and understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead, shit on me, I don’t mind, I’m the Cool Girl.

&gt;Men actually think this girl exists. Maybe they’re fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl. For a long time Cool Girl offended me. I used to see men – friends, coworkers, strangers – giddy over these awful pretender women, and I’d want to sit these men down and calmly say: You are not dating a woman, you are dating a woman who has watched too many movies written by socially awkward men who’d like to believe that this kind of woman exists and might kiss them. I’d want to grab the poor guy by his lapels or messenger bag and say: The bitch doesn’t really love chili dogs that much – no one loves chili dogs that much! And the Cool Girls are even more pathetic: They’re not even pretending to be the woman they want to be, they’re pretending to be the woman a man wants them to be. Oh, and if you’re not a Cool Girl, I beg you not to believe that your man doesn’t want the Cool Girl. It may be a slightly different version – maybe he’s a vegetarian, so Cool Girl loves seitan and is great with dogs; or maybe he’s a hipster artist, so Cool Girl is a tattooed, bespectacled nerd who loves comics. There are variations to the window dressing, but believe me, he wants Cool Girl, who is basically the girl who likes every fucking thing he likes and doesn’t ever complain. (How do you know you’re not Cool Girl? Because he says things like: “I like strong women.” If he says that to you, he will at some point fuck someone else. Because “I like strong women” is code for “I hate strong women.”)"

459,"I have thought about that.  He has made a new, younger friend recently who I think has boundary issues but he assured me that nothing was going on with them.  She is the only variable in this.

Rape jokes arent funny. Ever. If they laughed before they probably just felt uncomfortable. Chances are youre joking about rape in front of someone thaf has been raped and just hasnt told you. 

You say youd never rape someone, and i hope that is trur, but your jokes say differently to someone that has. Your jokes say you could. Change your humor. Do some research and realize why your ""jokes"" are so effed up.

I'm close to them and its going to suck to lose them but I already told him that if I move then its 100% over.  He thinks that if I move out we might be able to get the spark back.

476,"Then yes, he's cheating on you emotionally, even if she's just a friend, and you should make it clear to him that even if he isn't sleeping with her, it's still not okay. He's been checking out of your relationship. Lay out the reasons this hurts you as clearly and calmly as you can. Use therapy language if it helps (when you do x, it makes me feel x). Like I said, if he's really not sleeping with her and he really loves you, he will want to fix it. (Fix it here meaning something like reinvest in your relationship and spend more time with you and make you feel like the most important person in his life, not, say, cut her off entirely and never leave the house. If all that is going on is that he found a new BFF, that's not a fair expectation.) "
477,"&gt;If the mother feels that the kids should not be eating meat because it is immoral, then she has the right to have a say as their parent.

Give me a break. Basically, all of your points come down to, ""I agree with mom about vegetarianism, so an equitable compromise is that she wins."" 

Here's a hypothetical for you: Say that my kids decide that eating meat is cruel and want to become vegetarians. I think that's a bunch of hippie BS. Would you contend that it would be appropriate for me to sit them down in front of a rare steak and say, ""You're sitting here until you eat this,"" over the objections of my wife? "
478,"&gt; He's a wonderful Fiance, I think she just made him stray.

Sweetie....she doesn't have mind control powers. He cheated because *he* wanted to. She didn't hold a gun to his head. 

He's not a wonderful fiance, hon. He's a liar and a cheater. He doesn't even care how you feel about any of this. How is that wonderful? 

&gt;how would it happen again?

If he was willing to cheat for *months* now and only told you when she made him....how can you trust that he wont find someone else and this becomes a pattern? "
479,"I've been a vegetarian most of my life, and it's something I feel super strongly about. I'm also in a relationship with someone who doesn't feel the same, and that's okay. He and I have discussed what we'll do with any future kids and I dont actually want to force my views on my kids. I'll be honest, I'd prefer if they ended up veggie, but if they don't, no worries. 

The solution my partner and I came up with is to alternate who cooks. One day meat, one day veggie for dinner. I think that's pretty reasonable, at least while kids are too young to sort themselves out. 

One thing I will say though, is that to many vegetarians, the smell of meat/being around it really isn't pleasant. I can completely understand how your wife making comments about how disgusting your food is could be very annoying, and if that's what you want to eat, you're entitled to that. However, for the sake of harmony, maybe it's worth making a few small changes such as buying a new chopping board and knife and telling her she can have that as veggie only, opening a window when you cook, storing meat on lower shelves in the fridge,  etc. 

I know it's not something you agree with, but by being compassionate and considerate to her like this could definitely help her ease up a little, and allow you to say ""I've made these steps for you, can I please now ask you to work with me and equally respect my decision to not be vegetarian""
My guess is the pushiness comes from a place of feeling not listened to or not having her new values respected. "
480,"&gt;I originally only planned to find one summer roommate, but I somehow ended up with three.

That right there said you are a doormat and get walked all over. STOP doing all the things you are complaining about.

Better advice is give them a months notice and evict this bunch of users and get **a** better tenant

These girls even got you, THE OWNER to share your own room. No wonder they dont respect you, listen to you, pay you timeously and get you to run around AND buy the stuff, and you still keep doing it, WHY would they want to change this soft life they have. KICK them out, you are not going to straighten them out its three of them against you."
481,"&gt;I have so much potential. I'm young, smart, and beautiful. I have so much more to give this world than becoming a mother. I'm not meant for this life. I'm meant to have more adventures, meet more people, and pursue MY dreams. Find out what I want out of life first. I'm not ready to have a kid...I'm not even ready to be in a relationship. This IS NOT the life I want and even though I don't know exactly what kind of life I do want I want to be the one controlling it.

If you do not end your pregnancy and cut this guy out of your life...you will not have the life you want.  You have already answered your own question.  You don't need our permission.  Do it.  Wipe your slate clean.  Start over."
482,"Sometimes weddings have a wonderful way of showing you just who's a friend and who's not.

Just because you have history with someone, you've known them a long time, they've done a few nice things for you over the years- that doesn't necessarily make them a friend.

Cancel the credit card, cancel the reservations, get back as much money as you can, don't go to the wedding, don't buy her a gift, send her a quick email that just says something along the lines of ""my apologies, but due to my finances I will be unable to attend your wedding. best wishes and congratulations, hope you have a happy day."" (ABSOLUTELY write her an email telling her you're not going, don't just not show up- that's wasting her money!) And then that's it. You don't need to put effort into this friendship, you guys can just peacefully drift apart and sometimes think back happily on the time you shared.

I mean, I do see things from Tammy's point of view- you left an ""aggressive""/rude/weird message on her other friend's voicemail, you ignored her emails.... but that doesn't really excuse the weirdness around it, and you really just don't sound like you have a great friendship with her. So do like Elsa, and let it gooooo."
483,"Don't hate me for saying this, but given the manbaby he was over WoW and laptop repairs, you saved yourself having to raise two children, had you ever gotten pregnant by him."
484,He may have been even angrier if she did better than him with finals and all. He's pretty immature. 
485,"&gt; and now she's really, really happy.

She is.  That should be more than enough reason for me to get this stupid shit out of my head.

I have no idea why this bothered me so much, I actually am quite embarrassed that I even wrote this to be honest with you.

It's your choice to be nice or not while doing it, but just be mindful that some people are insane and do insane things. So keep friends and family (a cousin your age, or siblings preferably) informed of the situation, be mindful of your surroundings, and attentive to anything that seems weird.

Most importantly, DO NOT be afraid to say no, and do not be afraid to call 911."

489,"""He treats me very well and loves me dearly.""
This is probably true except for the whole lying to you about major life issues part.  You are in love and this is clouding your judgement.  To get some perspective, flip the script.  Your best friend or a relative tells you that they have been in a great relationship for 6 months, but just found out that the person they are with is 1. married, 2. significantly older than they had represented, and 3.  a liar.  He was waiting to hook you before he dropped these bombs.  I know it sucks, because you legit care for him but his behavior in the first six months should be raising some serious red flags.  He didn't come clean to you, even though he loves? you.  He only fessed up when caught.  People often use the excuse: ""but he's a great guy!""  Men who have to lie to this extent to maintain relationships are not great guys.  Get out before you get more entrenched.   "
490,"Yeah, that's probably a good idea. It's not like she's going to be any angrier at 5:30 than she was at 4:45."

When you are asked to be in a wedding party you don't join because OMIGOD I love weddings! You show up to be a support to the bride or groom. You are essentially saying, ""I am standing by this person as they make this important commitment."" Your feelings about weddings and how fun/boring they are do not matter at all. You do it because you care about that person. When the groom asked you to be in his wedding party, he was essentially saying, ""I realize we are about to be family and I'm embracing that. I want you to know that you are important to me."" You refusing because ""weddings aren't your thing,"" was a bit of a slap in the face. You really couldn't get over your wedding apathy for your *sister*? Really?! This milestone of hers is that insignificant to you? No wonder she was pissed, and rightfully so. 

And then to just demand an apology before you even *attend* her wedding? WTF?! Your girlfriend and your family are right. You're being a total, selfish shithead here."

Your mum will resent you and your dad for it, but this is for her own good."
498,"That's the exact problem. He is leaving himself an out.  The ring is a symbol that he isn't willing to take the leap of faith on her that he took on his ex. He is only willing to offer his fiancé what he isn't afraid to loose.

&gt; I just didn't want to risk spending so much again when nothing is certain.

He said it himself he isn't willing to risk being hurt again. He's not all in. He's not ready for commitment, he has one foot out the door to try and protect himself from being hurt again. Marriage is about going all in, and since OP doesn't want to do that anymore he isn't ready for marriage. 

Not many people would be willing to accept half commitment from a life partner.

Yes he did. 

OP, ditch this guy, he sounds like a grade A asshole. You deserve better than this, what a shitbag.

You keep trying to find the poop delicious because you're told the problem is your tastebuds, but it's really the fact that these crappy people try to feed you crap and tell you that's all you deserve.

I think you need to leave this craptastic spouse of yours and take some time (and therapy) to really start loving and appreciating yourself. And someday you will find someone who gives you filet mignon and chocolates, and you'll know that's what you deserve (because you do)."
507,"He's almost 30, people have pasts. This is going to keep coming up with most women he dates unless he starts picking up much younger girls or women at church or something."
508,"Why isn't abortion on the table?

Why is your entire family involved in this woman's decision about what to do with her pregnancy? 

Has she talked over the risks with a doctor yet? Has she gone to planned parenthood? "
509,"yeah, go ahead and dump her.  she's not going to change and she'll always blame you for her unhappiness "
510,"&gt; I enjoy hanging out with my friends online much more than hanging out with her.

I'd be curious to hear her side of the story. I'd guess there's plenty of blame go go around. "
511,"&gt; I am not a raging feminist

How about just a regular everyday feminist who believes in equality for everyone? There's nothing wrong with that, especially when you seem to have married a misogynist."
512,"Do you care about her friendship at all? It doesn't sound like you have much respect for her, understandably. I would tell him."
513,"Oh honey.  You're awesome to be so trusting, so I'm going to go ahead and go out on a loooooong limb and give him the benefit of the doubt as well.  Lets assume that this is platonic.  Okay.

That still doesn't change the fact that he didn't invite you, didn't talk about it to you when planning it, completely forgot that you wanted to go on a trip, and lied to you probably just to shut you up when he told you it was because of finances.  He's over you...he's just going through the motions of a relationship with you.  "
514,I plan on it when I get home from work.
515,"This is one of the most depressing things I've read in a long time. You got tired of your blow-up doll, I guess. It's not your *fault* that she is so desperate for your attention that she lets you do whatever you want to her, but you were sure quick to take advantage of it, weren't you? If you can't see how you contributed to her problems by doing that, there is NO hope for you as a human being.

If you're both in school, there should be free mental health services she can take advantage of. Please encourage her to go. Maybe she'll gain enough self-confidence to find a better boyfriend."
516,"&gt; It sounds like she is finally realizing the extent of it and starting to pull back to ""his level.""

I think you hit the nail on the head. She's trying to push him emotionally away because she doesn't want to love someone more than that person loves her."
517,"""Hey Kyle, when you first asked about seeing Gizmo I thought it would be fair and kind to you and Gizmo. But the way you're pestering me about him is not fair to me. I don't want you in my life anymore. If you cannot respect that, then I don't think there's any room for you to see Gizmo again.""

You have a lot more power here than you realize. I think you need to be upfront with Kyle that he's bothering you, and draw some clearer boundaries. The boundaries may be ""no more contact ever,"" and that's fine. You're trying to be compassionate, but Kyle has been taking advantage. If he can't respect reasonable boundaries, I think it's fine to cut contact entirely."
518,"You absolutely did the right thing.
 

When I was in high school, I started showing symptoms of depression, and one of my teachers pulled me aside and urged me to see a doctor. When I went home and told my mother, she flipped out and screamed at me that my teacher needed to mind her own business (except with more swearing).


On another occasion,  she told me that she would not be held responsible for whatever was wrong with me. And one time when I was diagnosed with ulcers, she asked me how I could possibly have ulcers. I told her that the doctor suggested it might be from stress (he also ended up treating me for the depression), and she yelled, ""what do you have to be stressed about?""


Basically anytime anything happened to me or anytime it was suggested that I needed help or might have done something wrong, she made it about her and her status as a parent. Now I'm dealing with multiple mental illness diagnoses on my own. 

You really did your friend a huge favor. I hope she knows that."
519,"Her pregnancy hormones are probably driving her reaction , but you shouldn't argue this with her. 

Short run: buy a box of doggie treats (Trader Joe has some nice bacon wrapped chicken jerky) only wife gives out the treats. Boom problem solved.

Long run: once the baby is born your wife will prioritize the baby and won't care.

BTW it's not really about the dog. She's worried the kid won't like her as much."
520,"I'm sure other people will have different opinions. But if you're 20 and you can pay for it yourself, there's no reason you shouldn't go. Tell your parents you're going with a friend who will cover for you if asked. I was lucky enough to have parents who didn't give a shit where I went or whom I went with by the time I was 17, so I don't know what it's like to have your sort of parents. But you're legally allowed to make your own decisions, and just because they're helping you with college doesn't mean you should organize your life around their religious beliefs. Be respectful, kind, and use your own money, but do what you want to do. You're your own person. "

526,"I kind of feel like his wife moving countries to be with him has to do with some of the problems. 

* It's easy to feel isolated and unsupported in a foreign country. She may have not built a community yet, or may not understand the tools to do it with.

* OP doesn't mention if she is a native English speaker, or how long it's been since she moved. Culture shock is a real thing, and so is communication getting lost in translation. 

* It also might not be possible for her to work in her prior field with the same income potential, for example. She may not be a ""forever"" low-income earner, if she were in her own country.

* What did she have to give up to be with OP? Is it possible she resents him for this?

ETA - all that to say, I agree with your depression assessment. It's easy to feel depressed in these conditions."
527,Why is Dave taking so many naps if he doesn't have a job?
528,"It's *incredibly* sweet of you to want to step in, but man OP. You're only 16. You have *no idea* how hard (and expensive!) a baby will be for Allie, and how life changing this is going to be. 

I'm going to be callous, but you need to think of your own life and where you want to end up. Please don't tie yourself into fatherhood because of a friend's bad mistake. She had one pregnancy scare already. Surely you saw this writing on the wall if she wasn't having protected sex? 

Be a support. Be a friend. Don't be a father when you don't need to be. You're *way* too young for all of this."
529,"I just wanted to state something, to ensure you frame it appropriately in your head:

Your mother turned on the garbage disposal when you were putting your hand in the drain! That is literally the kind of thing that happens in horror movies, and she did it because you were in the kitchen getting a glass of water for your prescribed medication. She didn't walk in on some Trainspotting-esque disaster, she did it because you were taking your prescription.

Your parents were terribly cruel to you, and showed a complete lack of understanding. The primary culprit, the woman who almost mangled her own daughter's hand in a garbage disposal, didn't even send the apology email herself. You owe your parents nothing, and if you want to try and build something with them, I suggest they start with a huge apology from your mum and an admittance of their severe wrongdoing, and then you set the pace. But if I were you... you've been happy for the last decade. Remember that. "
530,"So during the worst time of his life, you called off your wedding and then basically disappeared from his life??  And that makes sense to you?!?

*He was doing everything to support his family* and you were doing nothing for him.  You should have been at the hospital every day.  You should have been there.  Why?  Because that is what you do for people you love.  He dropped his whole life to take care of the people he loved and what did you do?  You dropped your wedding and him from your life.  Even if he needed space, you could have still been there for him.  You could have done his laundry, cooked him meals in advance, brought him changes of clothes.  Something, anything.  I mean, I just do not understand how you could possibly do what you did.

Let this be a lesson to you.  When people, especially your loved ones, are going through a tough time, don't give them space UNLESS THEY ASK FOR IT

Your fiance obviously needed you.  He needed love and support.  He needed to know he could count on you when times got tough.  And instead, you decided that calling off the wedding and then ghosting him was a good idea.  I'm sorry but your father is a fucking moron for telling you to give him space and you are even more moronic for following his advice.

Move on...because I highly doubt he is ever going to forgive you"
531,"I absolutely get the perspective of not telling her - you've done nothing wrong, the daughter has done nothing wrong, you didn't hurt anyone. I would be very nearly on that side...

But I'm imagining being your girlfriend, 3, 5, 10 years from now and finding out that my partner slept with my daughter and kept it from me. It would destroy me. I would be disgusted at being lied to about something like that for so long. That would end the relationship 100%. 

Whereas I think if you tell her now, and explain as you did here then there's only like a 90% chance it would end the relationship. 

I wouldn't feel right lying about this long term. "
532,"To be honest, I'm with your boyfriend on this one. He just started a new job, and even if his co-workers are awkward, he's trying to assimilate into the company culture. While this isn't official work duty, it's still an important networking/bonding exercise. I get why you're upset, but I don't think this is ""putting work colleagues before me."" I mean, I guess technically he is, but in this situation I would say that it's important for his new job to do this.

My question is, why can't you come in on Friday night, sleep together and wake up to have all of Saturday to do things?"
533,"I love this new generation.  You will literally have sex with each other, but are afraid to send a Facebook request.  I must be getting old...


Anyways, message her!  You've already seen everything.  Nothing to lose.  Good luck!"
534,"I'm with your husband on this OP. For one simple fact: Your mom was sober for a year and then relapsed while staying with you.


I can understand having started from pain meds for an injury and making the transition to heroin, and I can easily see a family member helping them recover from that. However, I cannot bring myself to trust someone who got clean and then voluntarily became an addict again, especially if they did that while living with me. They would irrevocably broken my trust.

Just another perspective for you OP."
535,"They'll probably all be relatively civil to you but they also won't forget that you declined going to your sister's wedding for such a stupid, childish reason. "
536,"she sounds like a real peach. things are going to start getting ""interesting"" in your neighborhood.

install cameras on your property as soon as you can.

"
537,"I've heard of lots of weddings that have gone on after major accidents and deaths of close family members. Obviously this is not the case here, but is not like it's completely uncharted territory for the show to go on. "
538,"Yes, it's called perimenopause.  "
539,"&gt;Also that he tried to change it back? 

Ok, let's say, hypothetically, this is 100% the truth. That the dating site has some sort of coding that won't let you change your DOB once you enter it.

Does that coding extend to his MOUTH, so that he can't tell you, at some point, over the span of six months, his actual age?"
540,Warn your sister and sit through the fray. Express your opinions in the confrontation. 
541,"That is not OK. You need to tell him plainly that he is NOT allowed to stop you, that you will come back to settle the discussion when you are calm. "
542,You really have a way with words and opened my eyes to realizing he probably isn't as sweet as I thought. 
543,"Gonna have to disagree with you on this one. I started dating my boyfriend at 16, when guys are expected and encouraged to be having sex with any girl they can convince to hop onto bed with them. I told him the day he asked me out that I wanted to wait until marriage and he never once pressured me to break that resolve. I was the one who decided (independently, with no encouragement from him) that I wanted to have sex before marriage. It wasn't until I told him about that decision that he opened up about how difficult it was to wait, sometimes. But for over two and a half years he was always extremely careful to make sure he never made me feel like I needed to do anything physical that I wasn't comfortable with. 

So I'm calling bullshit. If a guy pressured me to have sex the way OP's did I would dump his ass in a heartbeat
 "
544,"I have to ask, you say that you did the drive safe classes to get your licence back a little faster. Have you actually changed your behaviour? I mean, if that other reddit thread was your friend then you obviously needed a serious attitude check in regards to how you drive.

Obviously it was an accident. But you make it sound like it wasn't your fault - going through a yellow light a little too late? Reminds me of a woman I know who would flippantly say 'there's a bit of green in that!' You're in charge of a huge hulking heap of metal. You don't get to be casual about which rules you follow.

When terrible things happen due to your actions you can either take responsibility for them or hide away. If you genuinely can't face her, then at the very least let her know if you've changed. She might very well want to ask you questions you can't answer. Or she might want to make sure that you understand how this affected her. Or she might just want to see if you two can work things out.

To be honest, you called her while drunk and word vomited on her at what must have been a horrible and vulnerable time in her life. You were incredibly selfish for doing that. She was kind enough to hear you out. I would suggest you at least do the same."
545,Why don't you ask your boyfriend to invite Lucy (and her partner if she has one) out for dinner in a planned evening?
546,"Get an IUD in secret.  It will also act as ""plan b"" if you had unprotected sex in the past 3 days."
547,"Temporary insanity is a legal defense for a reason. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Honestly, people who haven't dealt with psychosis and severe mental illness or physical shit that causes confusion and amnesia don't understand what weird fucking shit you do without having control over it. BUT it doesn't *excuse* bad behavior, and it doesn't mean anyone else has to be okay with it. 

Like, she may be bipolar and experiencing/experienced a severe manic episode. No real way to know. Most important thing is that it's interfering with her ability to be a trustworthy leader, so she absolutely shouldn't be one. "
548,"I can't get the edit to work, so I'll type this here. I tried calling my friends room, but no answer there either. I think this shit is costing me like $10 every time I call. I guess I will sit tight until I hear from her because I've left messages for her to call me everywhere I can think of."
549,"In a serious relationships, decisions that affect the team are made together, as a team. 

He's not on the team, sorry."
550,"That sounds like a pretty common short-change artist trick. Both of you should talk to your boss and explain what happened, and that you already replaced the money. People like that are why a lot of stores refuse to make change for people outside of regular transactions.

Also, don't feel too bad about getting hit by this scam, literally everything they did, from the purchase to the distracting your friend with their ""daughter"" was intended to confuse and bewilder both of you so that you wouldn't spot their scheme. These things are really easy to dissect after they leave, but can be very difficult when they're in your face. "
551,That's a fun way to spin emotionally cheating on someone.
552,"You are a perfect example of how someone can be totally within their rights and justified in their actions, while at the same time being a gigantic and obtuse b-hole who is insufferable as heck. 

No one can tell you you're wrong, because you're not. But 'not wrong' is an awfully low standard to meet. 

Oh, except one thing: cats on vegan diets? That's animal cruelty. I'm sorry, but it is. I don't give a flip what the back of the kibble bag says, cats do not belong on vegan diets any more than humans belong on pure-bacon ones. You don't get to re-write nature's laws to suit your morals. If you won't do what it takes to maintain a healthy and happy cat, don't have a cat. "
553,"Has she done anything else sexual with you (oral, anal) or has it been *nothing* for 8 years? I think that makes a difference."
554,"Please be careful. You need to be so incredibly careful right now. He sabotaged condoms to impregnate you and he physically assaulted you when you asked him to leave. He knows the code to get into your apartment, and when you go through with the abortion, he's going to get worse, not better. I know you don't think he will hurt you, but I am here telling you that you are in serious danger.

Talk to domestic violence advocates, talk to campus security, talk to the police. Talk to your neighbors and ask them to keep an eye out and warn you if he comes by.

And I agree with /r/sprinklesadded : tell him that you had a miscarriage from all the stress. Under no circumstances tell this man that you had an abortion."
555,"Wow. As an animal lover, I am getting angry reading this/thinking about this :/

I could forgive her for a lot of things but offering my dog up to some lowlife to get drugs, I just don't know if I could."
556,"That may technically be OP's choice as a parent, but it would be terrible of him to continually hold back his daughter because of his son. 

Also, the fact that he thinks his sister should have moved her wedding to accommodate a 5 year old that doesn't even want to attend just shows removed from reality OP has become.

The choice to martyr his daughter may be his, but someday he'll reap what he's sown."
557,"&gt; So you were 17 when you got together and he was 25...huuuuge age gap, life experience gap.

The only time people seek someone that much younger (while in their mid 20s) is when their counterparts at their age see through their bullshit/dont want to deal with their immaturity.

That shit never works out well."
558,"I've read your post and I've read your responses,  and you know what really sticks out to me? It's all about you.  About how you feel, about how scared you are that she'll yell at you, about what you want. When the collision occurred (with your history I'm not even going to call it an accident) and the baby died, you cut and run. You didn't even apologize. You told your roommate to apologize for you. Your next communication with her was a drunken call on new years, where you cried to her. Exactly what did you say to her? Did you own your fuck up or did you just talk about how it all affected you? Look, maybe you'll get lucky and she's reaching out to offer forgiveness,  or maybe she finally feels strong enough to express how she's been feeling.  Either way, you owe it to her to listen."
559,"Oh. My. GOD. If I were Rachel, that one instance alone would make me run from this job. I've been stalked and that is the kind of creepy shit my stalker did. Please, please tell this poor girl what he's been doing/saying and alert your HR department right away."
560,[removed]
561,I would go as far to say that her unannounced visits are no longer welcome or she at least has to call first just so she doesn't accidentally find out things she shouldn't. It's kinda rude just showing up and letting herself in anyway.
562,[deleted]
563,"For me it sort of depends on the circumstances.  Is there a lot of one on one contact with the ex, particularly in person?  Or do they just move in similar circles and so stay in touch?  Do they have a history of being on again off again?  These are things I look for.

However it's inappropriate for you to bombard your partner with these questions.  Ultimately you just have to take a risk and wait until you're close enough to start getting a better picture of the relationship.  Nothing good ever comes without risks.  Maybe he still pines for his ex in his heart of hearts, but you can't just know that up front.

Generally speaking the older you get the harder it becomes to find people who have absolute zero contact with ex partners."
564,"your problem is that you're using earth logic . Earth logic does not apply here.

he's not worried about money- he gets off on controlling you.  One you figure his rules out on appropriate spending he's going to change the rules and move the goal posts so he can keep controlling you. "
565,This is my instinct but my family and friends have been very critical of this. Thank you for the validation.

568,"Speaking as a menopausal mom of teens, I do NOT advise asking in any way whether she's acting bizarre due to menopause. Seriously. Don't go there. "
569,"This is definitely the problem. Sounds like OP has been punishing his fiance because things didn't work out with his ex. I've had a relationship like that, and there's really no point for OP's fiancee to stay with him, it just gets more frustrating the more time and commitment increases.  "
570,"Hmm...  can you cheat with *her*?  Call her ""Mrs. McGillicudy"" or ""Battleship Kate"" once in a while..."
571,"I think you should stay out of what he and the mother decides to tell her about your relationship with her father, and direct any of her questions to her father. I don't think this is your issue to handle because both her mother and father need to be on the same page."
572,"Haha, that would be amazing! I actually went to boarding school in Toronto, so I know Canada well and love it fondly. "

574,"I would tell him that you had a miscarriage. There's no reason he needs to know about your choice. 

I know it's a tough choice, and I commend you for making it. I had an abortion before. PM me if you ever want to talk. It was one of the best decisions I ever made."
575,"Yup. Probably still not willing to cut the coworker out, either. He might briefly agree to it to get OP back, but he's already set up ""but I never crossed any boundaries and don't have any romantic feelings, remember! I would never cheat on you or hurt you, so I *am* going to go spend all my time with her still, cuz it's totes fine, kbye."""
576," You guy's need to have a conversation about this she spent the night, at her crushes house she admitted to liking, and he liker her too, after drinking a lot. Does she have any respect for you, how would she feel if you had a crush on some girl, and you told her you woke up in her house. It would be bad, you need to make sure she respects you or this will not end well. Good Luck OP"
577,"Not unreasonable 

Your husband DOES have to choose. And he has to choose you. 

Indeed, I'd insist"
578,Oh but there is. *Particularly* in this context. 
579,"My advice is to spend some time focusing on your family, especially your mom. After dealing with someone who called her a nazi based on her career choices, maybe meet up and talk about this. Take it as a bonding moment. Ask her what the worst date she was ever on was like. Laugh about this together."
580,Don't drag the 12 year old into this messy and adult situation where he has to choose between which parent to obey
581,"I'm about 7 weeks along right now and would do what OP's sister did in a heartbeat, no question.  I'm stoked on this kid, I know he or she will be awesome, but the fetus is kind of an abstract right now. Not a living, breathing person I love. "
582,Right? It's terrible but my first thought was that they would both get suspended or something. I'm glad the school did something right and kind.
583,"&gt; We think it might have happened when she had an infection and was on some antibiotic medication because apparently that affects the effectiveness of birth control but she's really not sure

Nurse here with a PSA. **YES. Antibiotics can seriously screw with your birth control.** I know three women who have had kids this way. It depends on the antibiotic and it depends on the BC. 
ALWAYS, ALWAYS ask your pharmacist when picking up your prescription if you need to use condoms as well during your course of treatment. It's their job to know side effects and they will be able to tell you."
584,"I'm a bit bemused by the people who are telling the OP how she is doing absolutely nothing wrong and egging her on. OP, you're right that you're doing something off. I notice you're just responding to the people telling you you're doing nothing wrong and seeming to double down, so I'm probably wasting my time, but you were being reflective, and so here is my constructive criticism:

you've got to scale it way back and think of more appropriate gifts.

1. the $500: it was way too much. It's creepy to give someone that much $$ like that. You should have given just $100. The person felt freaked out because it was too much $$ and they worry now what was your motivation. It's stalker-y to give too large a gift for an occasion. In the future, give a more average sized gift, and you'll get gratitude. 

2. The $100: it was quite possibly offensive because with the letter, it would trigger the person's pride. It's like you're pointing out how poor she is. I think it was the letter which really put the salt in the recipient's wounds, like you had wandered around all these years without ever seeing a poor person to pay your aunt's gift forward, and now you finally found someone pathetic enough. You could have achieved your goal if you hadn't written that stuff and hadn't sent cash, which is again kind of weird, but instead sent her a gift certificate for a spa or a salon and a note saying you thought she deserved a treat because of moving while pregnant.  You treated her like she is an object of charity, someone pathetic you feel sorry for, and that offended her pride.

3. The ring: her mom isn't dead yet, so don't console her for her mom's death yet. Again it is a little creepy to give a treasured memento of one person's death to someone unconnected to that person. And your friend is dealing with her mother's illness, and you're sending her some letter about how awful it was when your own dad died, so that is piling misery on top of her misery. And it's weird to be expected to wear a memento from someone else's dead relative. 

you have great intentions, OP, but you are tone-deaf. I am sure it isn't the one explanation you've thought of, that people think you're poor. You're emotionally tone deaf, and that is something you can work on."
585,"My grandmother lives out in the country as well, and this kind of thing happens a lot. Some live, some die, and some just disappear.  Short of fixing them yourself, no, there's not much you can do, especially since it's not your farm/barn. I commend you for being a caring heart, but take comfort that these aren't indoor cats who don't know how to survive in the wild.

If the population becomes a problem, that is her problem to fix. And if she decides that she likes have 30+ cats around, that is also her choice. "
586,"And let's face it, if OP's sister came to this sub asking for how to deal with a brother who attacked her she would get a *lot* of advice telling her to cut him out of her life."
587,"Yeah, it's odd... I've always deflected whenever she talked about future family, but I never said I wanted kids myself. I've always wanted a career more than anything.

One sister is already engaged and I'm sure it won't be long for the other one to get hitched. I think the grandkid thing will be covered."
588,Just because it's an improvement on what you're accustomed to doesn't mean it's what you deserve. You deserve more than this.
589,There are plenty of childfree people out there. You'll have no problem finding someone who isn't interested in kids. Just make it clear up front in a relationship and you'll be fine. 
590,It sounds like the parents (and likely the shrink) are exhausted from dealing with Katie's mental issues and are trying offload the responsibility onto you.  If you think you are in over your head with this girl (and it sounds like you are) then you are free to cut bait and run.  You are not obligated to make your life based around managing her's.

Edit: or just write it up and give it to him. Either way he knows how you feel. "
595,"&gt; You did exactly the right thing

Well maybe not the original plan of putting the bird in a locker lol but I can't fault OP, at 14 the plan was kind of adorable. "
596,"Well the website also shows the ""days on which you are most fertile."" If that is the problem I could find a website that doesn't explicitly say that. "
597,"Right? It's extra insulting because there's this implication that the brothers are somehow ""less than,"" which is utter bullshit. Was OP supposed to abandon her brothers because Jamie couldn't handle it?"
598,"No. No more chances. Having less time for your friends because of a new love is one thing, blackmailing your supposed best friend only moments from her wedding? Fuck that noise. Grow a spine OP. I would bet 10 bucks that you have put up with a lot of stuff like this from your ""best friend"" because you have low self esteem and are scared to let this relationship go."
599,You are clearly so selfish that you are glossing over 30 commenters giving you the advice you asked for because you thought someone here would validate your point. Wrong.

602,"You should flat out tell her that you want her to work full time AND take care of the household full time, because you want to keep your money for yourself. Just be completely honest and let her realize what a huge mistake she's made."
603,"To be fair, I think he's been reasonable throughout the entire thing while she has not. 
He's been accepting of her choices and shut up about any disagreement he may have had because her body, her choice. She hasn't been able to do the same. She's been trying over and over again to force her choices on her husband and children no matter how often he tried to explain to her why it was not OK. 


Frankly, I'd get resentful after five months of this too."
604,"&gt; Good work is ridiculously hard to come by and postal workers are highly respected in my neck of the woods.

605,"Not even she really thinks adopting disabled cats is wrong - she just doubled down after her initial attempt to be outraged about declawing failed. You shouldn't really be around people who double down rather than admit they're wrong, it's tiring and you'll be miserable all the time."

609,"I honestly can't imagine that life.  The closest I've ever come is the four months I lived completely on my own.  And it's not just my husband - my parents, friends, former roommates - all have told me that I'm stupid and useless and worthless.

And I guess that's why I believe it.  If one person thinks you're shit, they're an asshole.  But if everyone thinks you're shit... well, then you're probably shit, right?  That's what everyone says every time someone claims to have problems with multiple people.  And the only people who don't think I'm shit are my co-workers, and I spend all of 6 hours a week actually *talking* to them."

Are there behavioral issues with your daughter?

This doesn't make sense as a cheating thing.  It seems like he was expecting some kind of unpleasant situation to happen if he brought you and your daughter.  Or he was punishing you for something.  "
621,"Invoice her. She's treating her wedding as a business investment, not an intimate family event. Given that she'll be profiting off your involvement, quote her either an hourly rate or a percent of the profits. It might sound mercenary, but that's what she signed up for."

623,"Saying you want her to get a job because it's ""good for her"" is completely at odds with your OP.  You want her to get a job because you're tired of giving her money and you resent her.  Don't try and sugarcoat it.  Also if I were your wife and I got the ""I think this is good for you so I'm going to stop giving you money and you need to get a job"" after you'd encouraged me not to work, I'd be pretty pissed off.  Your ""conclusion"" that it'd be good for you is because you feel that's an easier line to spin than the truth."

626,"Its not good to drop out, don't let him ruin that for you. If you are afraid of him coming to campus, then why not tell the cops? If he's going to look for you on campus then he will look for you anywhere he can think of.

Edit- I understand that you care about him, and that you want to protect him. However he does not want to protect you, he is ok with hurting you. Guys like that don't deserve to be protected."
627,"It's not them choosing that's the problem. It's the fact that their parents are *not on the same team* about this, and it's going to cause resentment between the two of them. The kids are caught in the middle of their parents' dispute, and neither one of them are communicating properly. Once they get that figured out, then they can be on the same team about splitting meals. "
628,So his girlfriend treats him better than his family does?
629,"Instead of feeling bad and trying to make amends, stay a bit pissed at her shitty behavior and make it clear SHE needs to make amends. you are worried about offending them, but you should be disspointed in her behavior and waiting for them to apologize to you. if they can say sorry to jeff, you as host deserve a similar statement. maybe not a full apology, but she should feel bad towards you. not the other way around. 

but if you get all weak and apologize to her, she will let out all her frustration onto you, when she should still feel like the rude bitch she was. "
630,"I was raised by a man like this. 

Guess what? He is cut out of my life. He's cut out of my daughter's life. 

Also, OP, remember this: ***I blame my mother for allowing this shithead man to be my father in the first place.***"

633,"Alternate perspective: this was basically my mom, and I was your oldest daughter. Oldest in my family, too. 

First off, and this should be obvious, but the abuse turned to my other siblings as they got older, especially when I moved out. 

Now all the kids are out, and my mother *makes my father's life hell.* Does she pick fights with you how, sometimes? Be prepared for that to get a whole lot worse. 

I'm basically saying that I understand it's tempting to sacrifice one for the sake of the many (I don't even particularly bear my family ill will for doing this to me... most of the time). But the perfect family you're trying to preserve doesn't actually exist. Act accordingly. "
634,"Panicked there for a moment, until I realized you meant a different ex! Whew!"
635,"&gt;I don't know if I'm doing the right thing now

**HE HAS CHILD PORN!!!**

&gt;One day I took him to work and decided to snoop on his computer because of some comments he had made about a file on his desktop. I shouldn’t have. It was cp. I remembered what he said about his mom catching him doing things he shouldn’t be doing, and how it was her fault for snooping.

You glossed over this, made this less an issue.

&gt;""It's a child. **I'm molesting a child.** You make me think of all the things that I hate.""

Yes he is refering to you, but after all he has said, this is the most telling.  How can you even question if you are doing the right thing?

You don't need to just leave, you need to **turn him in.**   He sounds like a **violent individual with a sick obsession with children.  OP how will you feel if he rapes and kills a child?**

This is someone who punches walls, **brandishes a knife**, insults you, calls you a child, admits his mother caught him doing something to someone when he was younger, **talks about 10 year old girls ""doing things with fruits""**, cant keep a job and has given up, and has fucking child porn on his computer.

He sounds like he is going to be a **mass murder, or another shooter**.. you need to leave and **alert the police to his behavior, he is dangerous**. I mean for fuck sake, he wants to make bullet proof armor (ever seen rampage?) "
636,"Your tomboy friends sound ghastly, but hey, you like them. Your GF doesn't though and has made that *abundantly* clear.

Sooo what do you do ? Do you respect that ? Hell no ! You invite them along to **her** friend's birthday party. And when one of them drinks so much she needs to be helped out, you ask your girlfriend to help what ? Carry her ? Hold her hair while she pukes ?!?

Backed up by the fact that your friends have made it clear that they don't like *her* and think you can do better with someone  more like, er, one of them ?

If you *really* loved your GF, you wouldn't give up your friends for her, but neither would you be rubbing her face in them either.

Here's the thing, I don't think you need to worry about this too much, because your GF is going to dump you for being an inconsiderate arse and you'll end up with one of your loudmouthed friends instead - which is a win-win for everyone.

"
637,"Whenever someone says that they went on something like tinder while they're in a relationship and justify it by saying something like ""I didn't intend to cheat"", I can only think two things.

1.) You're lying.

2.) While you may not have ""intended"" to cheat, you would have if the right circumstances came along. 

How about this: the next time you're having problems in your relationship, you don't hop on a dating app and deal with your problems like a man. That means communicating, working together as a couple, getting counseling if need be, or even just ending it if it's that bad. 

Frankly, I think what she did is kind of awesome. "
638,"Dude you're 22. I am 21 and live at home, I don't stay out super late often because I know it will stress them out, I don't bring people over very often, etc, etc. Those are all directly related to me living with them, and as such I must compromise a lot to make them happy because that is what a respectful daughter does when she lives at home rent free.

However not going on a road trip with your boyfriend because she's worried you're gonna be fucking him is CRAZY. You're an adult. Just fucking go. Let her birth a herd of moo moo cows, she'll get over it eventually. You CANNOT invite only half of a couple, it is rude, and your inability to do things for yourself without trying to accomodate your mother's stupid ideas (sorry but who the fuck cares about premarital sex anymore? her outdated views are not your burden to bare) is absolutely the worst fucking excuse for pulling a rude stunt like that imaginable.

If you are inviting Robert, you are inviting Dana. There is no way around this. You may not like her, but she is his girlfriend and she is his priority. Don't put him in that position."
639,"This is so true. I wonder if OP and sister have read The Gift of Fear.
And if he wasn't doing anything creepy, he wouldn't have bolted from the room, and he wouldn't have needed to lie.
In fact, if she DID dream it and got freaked out, stepbrother would be concerned about her and absolutely beside himself that she was afraid of him- he wouldn't be focused on denial."
640,"Please don't do that. Especially if you aren't feeding them to their satisfaction at home.

642,"Eh. Every now and then it's applicable. If you love me and want a life with me, you'll stop drinking. Stop doing coke. Stop doing heroin. Whatever. 

But yeah ""bring your camera on vacation"" is definitely not on that list. "
643,"Guess what, the ""no clubbing"" rule only ever applied to you. I'm guessing this isn't the only time he's lied. He's jealous, controlling, a liar, not even a good liar, and you don't trust him. 

Why keep this relationship going when he's already checked out?"
644,"&gt; It is getting to this situation for me now. Mom pressuring me to take care of my brother when she's gone. I keep telling her he will go to a lovely care home, but I will not put my life aside to raise her son.

Yep, same here. 

My parents acknowledge how much raising him sucks but now they are getting close to their 60s, they keep trying to subtly hint that perhaps my husband and I could take on more responsibility for him. And they really want us to agree to take him after the die.

I have told them firmly that his care will revert to the state when they pass away. I will not accept guardianship or anything that will make me financially liable to pay for his care. 

My husband's brother and his wife passed away last year in a car accident. My husband's other brother and his wife are the guardians of their 3 sons (all under 8) and raise for them along with their 2 daughters. 

My husband and I are not planning on having children ourselves (as big reason? The fear I'd have a kid like my brother. I'd rather *die* tbh) but we are helping my husband's brother and his wife out financially as they were willing to take the boys on. We would have done it if we had to, but we were grateful to not have to take them on full time and figure helping out with the finances is the least we can do. 

My husband and I help out by buying their birthday/christmas gifts and decided that we will save for the boys' college funds as their parents died with a pile of debts meaning there was no inheritance. I prioritise saving that money for these kids who have the potential to grow and develop and do something with their life than I do paying for slightly fancier care for my brother who quite honestly, is better off dying quickly. If one of more of the kids decides they don't want to go to college, the money is ours (with how we have set it up it, it is in our names so it is not 'tied' to college) and will go into our retirement fund. 

This *really* bothers my mother in particular, but to be honest, I don't really care. Let the state take care of my brother that's what I pay taxes for anyway. I'll take care of my 3 nephews so they don't have to take on a $100k debt to get an education in the future or put the money into my retirement fund. I don't want to throw money at my brother's care, and honestly, it is not my responsibility to do so. He's not my child. 
"
645,"There's isn't a little family to rip apart. He's going and making little families everywhere, so cut him loose before he further damages YOUR family. 

PS I grew up in a little family of me and mum, and it was much better without a deadbeat dad to make promises he won't keep. "
646,"&gt;  But with my family there's no giving a little.

You've got it, sister. Also, you think you're strong now? Wait until your baby is here and see how you react to bullshit."
647,What's her explanation for smoking weed while being three hours away with their child?
648,"Agree with her, but do whatever you want, if she speaks about your body you tell her that she is right and that you are in therapy for this, if she talks about your legs you tell her that she is right but you are so brainwashed by the patriarchy that you went to get your legs waxed and it will pass a lot of time till your hair grows. 

But deep down, know that she is a bully and she is deranged, she is only trying to make you fell worse and bully you."
649,"I'm also EU in UK. Been here most my adult life. Over the past few days I've felt anger, rejection, disappointment, and have lost a lot of respect for friends. 

&gt; I know it's all still fresh and I'm still in shock but I'm seriously considering packing my bags and moving back to my home country/somewhere else within the EU.

The only thing stopping me from doing that is that it's a rash decision and I love the UK. 

I don't really have any advice for you as I'm in a similar boat though single so at least don't have that worry. However, I'm not sure I'd be with someone who distinguishes between good and bad foreigners."
650,[removed]
651,"You did the right thing.

Block her mother. There's  no reason for you to have contact with her especially since she's being awful to you. "
652,Is it legal for me to move out if we're married? He handles all of the finances too so I wouldn't have anywhere to go. My family is across the country and I don't have any friends around me. 
653,:( I'd like to offer you some internet hugs. You deserve so much better than that. 
654,"Yeah. I feel like it's important for me to carry on the family legacy in the farms to. It is a reminder of what my immigrant parents built with their own two hands and the 22 dollars they came to America with. 

We are definitely going to reassess the situation tho."
655,What grounds would she have?
656,"First of all, you didn't destroy their relationship. Your ex destroyed their relationship by cheating. 

I can't believe your ex has the gall to call you up crying and lamenting his situation. Oh poor man, having made his bed and having to lie in it. 

I would file the custody arrangement if that's what she wants. In time she may gain a different perspective. When (and more importantly *if*) that occurs, then you can change the arrangement again down the line.

She's old enough to make her own decisions about who she wants to spend her time with. I would let her do it and try to support her in any way she needs support. It may have been ""so long ago"" to you, but to your daughter it's all brand new information. She's unlikely to get over it any time soon. So let her deal with it in the way she needs to. Counselling would help if she's willing to go. Don't try to force the issue too strongly though if she doesn't want it. 
"
657,"OP's mum needs to learn the price of her own behaviour in enabling her son to get bailed out every time he made a mistake. If she didn't want the baby to go to CPS, she could have taken him in herself."
658,"Our roommate leaves the door unlocked alllll the time.  She'll pop out for a quick smoke behind the parking lot, not in direct line-of-sight of either entrance."
659,"Yup. You are thinking clearly girl. This changes or GTFO. 

I am re-reading what you wrote here.

&gt;He's supposed to take her out on her Bday in a couple weeks, which I am not OK with. I'm, of course, not invited. It stings because he didn't take me to do any of the things I asked for on my Bday just a few weeks ago - I had given a small list of low cost, even free activities. And, I wasn't really able to be included in any of his birthday activities. This sucks, and I'm really to the point of thinking I can do better and I deserve better.

**YOU DESERVE BETTER THAN THIS.** Two questions A) that he would even do this to you, and expect you to take a back seat, keep her a secret from you and NOT participate *while he builds intimacy with a secret woman right in front of you,* what does this tell you about HIS character? ... and B) you aren't married to him, so don't fall for the ""sunk cost fallacy. 2 years isn't *too* long in the grand scheme, and you have a positive self worth, aren't self deprecating and have a grasp on the reality of the situation you are in. Don't fall into the trap that he's going to change, or you are going to change him. *Just get out.* You are better than that.

&gt;He can choose to keep her in his life, and I can choose to seek a relationship with someone who doesn't need secret girlfriends to confide in.

This. *You deserve someone that is going to be honest with you, that isn't going to have secret relationships behind your back, and cultivate intimacy with someone else without you.*

"
660,There are likely other reasons that she is losing the deposite. I would tell her no.
661,"At a certain point, it's just not worth it.  And some smells just won't come out.  "
662,"This is exactly right! OP cannot continue to spend money on this guy, and say it's okay, and then get upset when he acts the same way he always acts and quibbles his expenses down to the last dollar.  
 
OP, do not spend a single dime on this man. When you go out to dinner, you pay for what you ordered, and he pays for what he ordered. When you go to a bar, you pay for your drink, he pays for his drink. If he gets sick, you ask him for money to buy the supplies he needs, and then you bring him home a receipt and his change. If he calls you petty, explain that this is the exact arrangement that he has made with you, and you are honoring that arrangement. 
 
"
663,"I am of the same ethnicity as you so I understand the cultural background and issues and I'm begging you, please leave as soon as possible before you end up an honour killing statistic or trapped in Pakistan without your passport (I live here, I know exactly how easy it is to skirt the law). Start withdrawing your money in small increments and put it in another bank account. Make copies of all important documents or try to have the originals if you can get away with it. Look for organizations that specialize in helping victims of domestic violence or those of Asian descent. Most importantly, do NOT trust your family if they find you and pretend to apologize/ask to meet up. They will hurt you for the sake of ""izzat"", make no mistake about it"
664,"&gt; I don't bring her up often but a lot of experiences I had in life she was present so I end up bringing her up.

I dated a guy for five years. He was present for most of my life-experiences at that point. When I traveled, it was was with him. When I bought a car, it was with him. I visited tons of different places, saw things, met people...if I'm going to talk about something exciting or interesting I did in those five years, chances are he was there or helped plan it.

But that doesn't mean I have to include him every time I talk about those things, especially when talking to other romantic partners. If we're going to see Niagara Falls, it's fine if I tell my husband that I've been there before. It's less fine to tell him that I went there with Joe and we stayed at a romantic bed and breakfast and...well you get the picture.

I don't think your fiancee is being over sensitive on that one."
665,"Or maybe she was telling you exactly what happened and you blew her off. All through your post you dismiss her viewpoint and comments. Think about why you do that, man."
666,Instructions unclear. Broke up with girlfriend.
667,"&gt; Cutting contact willy-nilly with a friend of 15 years because of a single argument?

You do realize that it's actually Dan who is doing that?"
668,"Be careful of him being *pissed* at you. He may tell you that he feels you went behind his back and/or don't trust him.

Be careful also that Sara may know about you *and still be sleeping with him anyway.* He says she has a boyfriend. She may. 

Finally, consider if you really want to be in a relationship where you don't trust your partner to the point that you're physically going behind his back when he's out of town. Whether he's lying to you or not, is that something you want?"
669,"I would break up with him for this. He disrespects you, and doesn't think anything of telling your friends vulgarities concerning you.

If you continue the relationship, it may get worse. I didn't leave my boyfriend who recorded me naked without my consent while we were in bed. It got worse: manipulation, control, blaming his actions on me, etc.

Edit: I should have broken up with him a few months earlier when he admitted that he told his ""close"" female friend  (whom I also knew) about sexual problems we were having. ""But the connection between you and Krista is WEAK! So it doesn't matter!"" is what he said. I finally broke up with him a month after he left me in a freezing car for an hour because his image in front of his client was more important than asking her if I could come in while he did computer work."
670,"I would mention it as professionally as you can.  As this point, that knowledge can't really make things worse, and they'll probably be more sympathetic.


Just be brief and professional; no need to get into deep feelings or anything, just a ""my family got terrible news and we've been coping with an emergency.  I apologize for the impact it has had on my interviews"" or something.

Just don't expect miracles.  If they've already written you off as a good candidate, this probably won't make a difference."
671,"Well your girlfriend is right isn't she? You essentially took a co-worker on a date. Now you're determined to go to a party where you'll be with her and surrounded by alcohol, after promising to spend less time with her. Your girlfriend tried to compromise by suggesting you bring her. you said no, but you also insist on going. How do you think that looks? 

Sounds to me as though you don't believe you were wrong, despite what you say."
672,"Don't do anything. She sounds like a terrible sister and he's not much better. I mean, dating his baby mama's sister? Gross! 

Leave them to it. Sounds like a match made in heaven. "
673,"How is the relationship with your family now? Why did you want to leave them?

I really get the feeling you need to break up with him or at least move away and have a think about life for a while. You don't seem to be getting anything you want and need to focus on your happiness. 

I also don't get the greatest feeling about your relationship. It started long distance and you moved in with him when you were 19 or 20 (with him a decade older)."
674,On top of all that somehow the 23 year old ended up with full custody. This is a super sketchy situation.

679,"I've always wondered how the family and friends of these daily life vloggers put up with a camera constantly being shoved in their faces. It can't be very rewarding to interact with someone whose attention is more focused on performing for their audience than the actual people in the room with them.

Since your brother also doesn't like being a part of the vlog, maybe you can both sit down with your sister and explain that this is damaging your relationship with her. I'm sure you've made this clear in the past, but treat this as a mini-intervention.  Write down your thoughts and read them to her: ""Your vlogging has effected me in the following ways: I don't want to be a bridesmaid at your wedding. I can't attend my mother's birthday party. I'm considering moving to Europe because you have hijacked our entire family in your pursuit of internet fame"". Follow it up with that by telling her how much you love her and would like to have a good relationship but that's impossible unless she is willing to start respecting you and your boundaries. It sounds like she needs to hear how much she really stands to lose if she can't stop putting fame over family.

684,Maybe she was controlling because you're a childish irresponsible man who can't handle his own shit like an adult and then complains when other people have to do it for him? 
685,No she doesn't. It's an option of course if other things didn't work out but I'd rather try to get money from our parents first. 
686,"If they are going to stay overnight, then I think asking for some notice, at least a few days is reasonable.  If they are just going to visit, then maybe a day before heads up is reasonable as well.  Some people just like to have time to mentally and physically prepare for visitors.

All in all, I don't think her requests are all that unreasonable.   That said, the fact that she acts miserable the whole time they are there is pretty unreasonable, so I think if you can give her the compromise of advanced notice in exchange for her to be in a better mood when they are there, that should work out for both of you."
687,"Yes, but she came back demanding apologies and not acknowledging that her meltdown was not his fault, and she's the one who walked. I wouldn't have the patience for it. She must be smoking. "
688,"Hahaha, well OP, I was in a similar situation with an ex's brother, in that I couldn't have him but I almost thought I wanted him. But even if I got him, I knew that it wouldn't be as magical as I believed it would be. I didn't truly want to be with him *forever*, I just wanted him for stupid impulsive reasons. It was weird and out of nowhere. But I never acted on it, it actually passed believe it or not!!! Now I'm still great friends with the ex and his family. I promise with time the feelings will lessen and you'll be onto brighter things. You'll be really happy, so will your mom. "
689,"According to your story, she told you many times!!!"
690,"Exactly this. Raising a child is not sexual. Changing diapers is necessary and part of parenting. If he thinks that act is sexual, it is his own fetish or issue. "
691,I'm surprised you're the only one who caught that! He had no idea of the gender of the person(s) involved in the accident.

693,OP please bring someone with you even if you're sure he's not going to be there! Safety first!
694,"It doesn't make a ton of sense to me to expect someone to be able to put forth the energy to ""expand his social circle"" while he's recovering from major surgery. Making new friends in a place you just moved to while you're housebound or not very mobile is *hard*. I'm not saying be completely reliant on OP, but it's not at all unreasonable for OP to pay attention to the guy not feeling isolated."
695,When you put it like that..
696,"You should ask him if he's planning on getting a penis enlargement surgery and when he says no, dump him. Be pretty funny."
697,"You're the side piece.  Sara's the real GF.

&gt; He told me that he's told her about me, she knows about me

If she knows about you, then there should be no problem with you talking to her on your own.  Go over there some time when she's there and he isn't and have a little chat.
"
698,"Nope, hasn't happened to any of us.  They're both optimists, I'm the apartment pessimist.

That being said, all of us had shitty childhoods, and the roommate is a true-crime/horror enthusiast.  So we're not unaware of how terrible people can be...so why not just lock the door!?"
699,"This sub focuses on cheating in the context of romantic relationships. Within that context, it is reasonable to distance yourself from cheating and cheaters. A rapist can be a good boss, a domestic abuser can be a great homeless shelter volunteer, an embezzler can be a fantastic mother, a conman can be a superb husband. Doesn't change the fact that you should stay away from being alone with the rapist, not hire the embezzler to manage your finances, and avoid marrying the domestic abuser. All the good they may do in other roles becomes less relevant when your relationship with them is the kind of relationship in which they hurt and betray. 

You can call people who despise immoral behavior naive and oversimplifying all you want - it doesn't make the immoral behavior somehow moral. You think good people make hurtful decisions sometimes - others may think that what makes people good or bad is how much they hurt others with their actions and whether they make amends for the hurt they've caused. Both viewpoints are valid."
700,"DO NOT GO BEHIND YOUR HUSBAND'S BACK. 

People can say they think you are horrible because *they are not supporting her or the baby*. I would ask everyone who expresses that opinion to say in dollar amounts how much they are willing to help. Or, better yet, to show you the nursery they are setting up. They think because you are childfree and work that you should be fine with raising a child.

A 22 year old with a medical condition and no financial support  should not be having a baby.  

Lay out the cold, hard facts to your sister: ""I love you, but there is absolutely no way you can stay here with a child. My marriage can't take it. Here are your options: 1) make medical arrangements, 2). inquire into adoption 3). Move in with Mom and have the baby--here are the social service agencies that MIGHT offer help.""  If she wants to be an adult, she has to make some adult decisions. What if you got hit by a car tomorrow? She would be in just as bad of a spot?

Its possible she got pregnant by this guy as a way to be free of your Mom and family, but it backfired."
701,"&gt;When we started dating our sex life was awesome. We did it regularly and it was great. After we got engaged my wife allowed her religious friends to tell her we shouldn't have sex until after we were married and so she cut me off. 

Why did you not see this and say ""I'm fucking out.""?
"
702,"It was a very uncomfortable night. I've only known him about a year, but the other girl who was there has known him and worked with him since he started. One of the reasons I stayed late is that I honestly felt like leaving her and him alone wouldn't end well. He was just so disturbing. "
703,It should scare him away.  One month and she permanently marked herself with his name?  Hope it's an easy cover-up.
704,"You do realize she probably had a relationship with those people too right? That's her former mother in law and sister in law. She knew them for years. There's a chance they view that baby as part of their family. Also, how is she supposed to figure out possible co-parenting and child support if OP won't even acknowledge the pregnancy?"
705,[deleted]
706,"Has OP even discussed the proposal with the kids? His remarriage would be a huge life change for them and they should not have this sprung on them at a family vacation as a surprise! (If he's already warned the kids, though, I'd say it should be ok. But still leave the ex-wife out of it.) "
707,"I wish people would stop mentioning alcohol in their cheating posts. It is irrelevant.  

RECOMMENDATION:
Learn from this and move on. Even if he says he forgives you, the relationship is now poisoned. It will end. Maybe a week from now. Maybe a year. Maybe a decade. It will come up again... and again... and again... You will become frustrated and scream *""that was years ago. How long will you hold that against me?""*

And the answer of course is, until one of you dies. So don't condemn yourself to that hellish future. Learn from your mistake and move on.

"
708,You just shower her with praise and hold her if she loses. Tell her she is the #1 Miss Brazil in your heart. 
709,Sounds like there is an issue with all the adults in that side of the family...
710,They met up for kisses. She might have touched his penis a little bit too. 
711,"&gt;But it was a serious long term relationship based on a huge lie. She's probably way, way over him at this point.

Lies or not, her feelings were real.  She also seemed overly-attached to the idea of that letter.  

&gt;So I think there's a more than decent chance OP and this girl can go the distance.

I don't disagree.  I was just cautioning against moving too fast. I didn't say he should break it off or anything.  

"
712,"Cool, jump to the dumping. If he asks why, I'd give him the link again and block him."
713,Yay. Awesome update. May your lady garden flourish now it's free of this jerk.
714,"I told him this morning, I think he was kind of numb after everything he said last night, so he just agreed. 

He's been texting me all day from work, saying that he's sorry and that he will come to my show, but I replied that he's no longer invited. I'm staying at a friends place for the next 4 days, I'm just in the middle of packing all of my clothes now. 

I don't care about the furniture in the flat, and I'm leaving my bike and instruments with my friend, so she can use the bike and take care of my instruments. "
715,"She's literally a ""Mommy."" She cooks, she cleans, she does your fucking laundry. You two cuddle on the couch. You prioritize her over your girlfriend. You stay up late several times a week with just her while claiming to have no time for your girlfriend. Because you're always with your sister.

And spare me the ""we're roommates so naturally..."" bullshit. This wouldn't happen if you had a different roommate. You don't spend an unheathy amount of time with your sister because she's your roommate.

And what did you say in a comment about never putting girlfriends over family? What if your girlfriend becomes your wife? Will you still put her on hold for your sister?"
716,"&gt;Or he has really serious issues and needs a therapist- not a vaginal spelunking tour. 

Fixed that for you. ;) "
717,"I'm sorry but this is so stupid.

Everyone is different but most people's sexual pleasure is also mental and emotional. What he was asking is, ""Am I enough to satisfy you? Am I as much of a man as they are?"" What she said was ""I will soothe your anxiety and reaffirm your masculinity in any way I can. Oh, and by the way, your penis is actually better because it is your penis and I love you.""

I just slept with my ex, who is casually dating someone else. She fell out of love with me 6 months ago but we broke up only a month ago. I don't need internet points so just take my word - compared to ""new guy"", my dick is more enjoyable, my body is more physically attractive, and I'm better in bed. And none of it matters one bit. We had sex 3 times over 4 days. The first was amazing. The last time lacked any emotional involvement on her part.

The first time was incredible sex that she might never have with this new guy. But the last time was just sex, nothing special. A dick and a tongue are not enough to hold a mature relationship together and not nearly enough to provide sexual pleasure to those who require mental and emotional stimulation as well. 

Edit: Wording.

718,"I've considered that several times but I'm scared that she will try to contest for full custody of our son. If this wasn't a worry, I think I would have done this long ago. "
719,Paul is not overreacting. You should bring her in sober and make her apologise to him. 
720,Why are you okay with being with someone who has an issue introducing you as his girlfriend after 2 years together?
721,"Um. It was a mosquito. Yes, it was petty of your sister, but I hardly think she ""took pleasure in you being harmed"". You seem very over dramatic And, frankly, full of yourself. Let your sister find her own way. Lots of younger sisters are jealous of their older sisters. I was, too, but I grew up. I get the feeling your sister doesn't like you because you lecture her and act like you're some kind of God who can't be tainted with something so simple as a mosquito bite. I would be glad you aren't talking to me, if I was her."
722,It was a combination of she stopped listening to me and shock. I tried to say something else and she just completely ignored me. She literally stopped talking to me

725,"Then I wouldn't even worry about it. If you are behaving like a responsible pet owner, that's all you can do. If they want to climb a tree, that is on them. Just continue to show them through your behavior that neither you nor your dog is a threat."
726,I'm really glad to hear this. It sounds like your parents are taking things seriously and aren't going to just brush everything under the rug. Your brother probably isn't in much of a place to be reasoned with but hopefully they'll find some way to get him into treatment at least so you don't have to live in close quarters with him.
727,"Some people here are telling you he may be embarrassed because you're overweight but let me tell you some things.

I have drunkenly told SO many friends I was in love with them. I've drunkenly had sex with a few guys I considered my best friends, some of them more like brothers. I used to be in love with one guy every time I was drunk around him but when I was sober I absolutely couldn't stand him. And we were all really embarrassed by it.

It didn't have anything to do with what anyone looked like. Some people get drunk, feel the feelings in the drunk this is the best night with this person moment, and don't feel the same sober. I feel like that may be what happened here. "
728,"I use ""Period Tracker"". It shows fertility but only with color coding. It's an app on my iPhone. It shows up as a flower icon on my phone with the name ""P Tracker"". I've been using it for years and love it. 

P.S fertility on the apps is only an estimate. I've been trying to get pregnant for a couple of months now and really active around my ""fertile"" window and still not pregnant. "
729,"Is it really privilege when generations of girls have been aborted, abandoned, or otherwise disposed that it has led to that level of inequality in the number of men vs women? "
730,"I think you should confront her, and let her know that from here on out she will be the very last person to know anything going on in your life since she has proven she is neither trustworthy or respectful. I don't think you necessarily need to do this in person given you are still grieving and she will most likely get very defensive; it could get very ugly. It might be best to write everything you want to say in a letter, and then decide if you want to send it or if you think you can do this in person.

Then, you limit contact and put her on an information diet. "
731,"I have an Indian mother.. Don't think she'll ever be satisfied with that I'm doing at this point so I'm going to put that out of mind for now. I know this is an odd question, but is there a way not to feel so anxious about my sexuality?"
732,"Maybe she was just trying to pick a fight - any fight - with you guys, to try and isolate Dan from his friends. Manipulative people will sometimes set up situations where you have to ""choose"" between your friends, or the manipulative partner. She knows you're not going to apologize (because you didn't actually do anything wrong), and that's exactly what she wants, because the next step is to ask Dan to cut you guys off. Jason should talk to Dan and ask if she has a history of doing stuff like this..."

737,I'm worried he'll get a feeling that you're leaving. Having an officer present is not a bad idea even if you leave while he's out. 
738,"Don't listen to his excuses. He's going to make a lot and try to justify his actions. 

&gt; ""I say no to stopping and you never listen to that"".

WTF is this shit? That has nothing to do with ""no means no"". The fact that he even paused and said this is horrendous. Honestly this kind of behavior isn't fixable overnight. It's not going to get better, he's going to keep acting like this and making excuses. It's better for you mentally and physically to get away from this guy ASAP."
739,Thank you...I guess I do need a counselor.   I want to have a family.  I guess I just don't get to have one.  I did let my sister in law know that I have screen shots of her threats.  She deleted her facebook posts after I told her that I could us those threats against her.  But it was too late because I already saved them.
740,"Ok it's not the same as racism or sexism. Repeat after me, *""That was stupid and I will never make this comparison again.""* Moving on...why do you care what they have to say about it? Ignore it. Go out, enjoy life and experience whatever you feel you've missed out on. What they think about your appearance doesn't really matter. "
741,I could try and contact my aunt she still talks to me occasionally.
742,"No it isn't. Because if there is some reason that you can't meet because one of you will get hurt, that is still 100% his fault. Everything you each know about the other is straight from his mouth. He didn't have to tell her whatever shit he did to make her not like you. And he didn't have to badmouth her to you. He could have told her how awesome you were and how happy you made him, and she would have been excited to meet you. But he didn't. And he could have told you about his super awesome friend and how much fun he used to have and how he's sure you'll love her. But he didn't. Those were choices that he made that led to this situation. (Side note: I do not for one moment believe this is 100% platonic, but I'm answering as if it is)."
743,"This is exactly what I was thinking. OP doesn't realize she is not actually helping her sister at all. She is trying to enable her and sister is taking advantage. Husband is 100% correct about sister being irresponsible. Not saying she shouldn't have sex, but if she is in a position where she can't even take care of herself, how does she expect to take care of a baby too? OP if you don't nip this in the bud and ""get rid of her"" she will keep using you. If she can't realize the scope of what she is doing then it's because she doesn't want to see it and she knows that she can get you to take care of her forever. You were actually considering to betray your husband and marriage for a dumb girl that made a stupid mistake who doesn't care about the consequences at all because she knows it won't affect her. She wants to be crazy, send her to your Mom. "

747,"/u/wifevegetarian, I think this is the best / most reasonable answer here so far.

At the end of the day the two of you can choose to eat / not eat whatever you want. What's important is your kids health and how they view eating.

For example - what are you putting with your meat? The kids need to be getting the correct nutrients from their meals. For example taking mom's veggie pasta with some of dads chicken would be good for them in terms of their health but in also seeing how to compromise.

The last thing you want is to make dinner time ""a big deal"" or a source of tension, that's how you get fussy eaters."

749,"Yeah honestly you should just leave this alone. I have a hormone disorder that, among other frustrating symptoms, includes increased facial hair. If I wanted to be smooth all the time, I would have to wax twice a week. Which causes extreme irritation and hurts like hell. 

She very well could have a similar issue. I don't want to irritate my skin by tweezing, waxing, shaving, or using hair removal cream. And that's completely my choice. It's her choice as well. Your best bet is to leave it be unless she brings it up. Being a fuzzy woman is embarrassing enough without having the guy you're dating point it out. "
750,"Proposing on a family vacation is actually kind of weird. Does GF especially love Disney weddings and the vacation with kids was just an excuse to get her to Disney? I don't get why you aren't going on a romantic getaway alone with her for this.

TBH not knowing about the proposal GF was probably be greatly on board with ex coming because that way the two of you would have more time for nookie while Ex took the kids at night. And she possibly also was being kindly mindful that she didn't want to put the Ex in the classic good cop/bad cop situation of divorced parents... primary parent has to supervise bedtimes and homework, other parent whisks them off for once-in-a-lifetime Disney memories.

It is going to be hurtful to your Ex no matter what, but absolutely do not let her come along. I would honestly split it up into two events if at all possible, for BOTH your GF and Ex sake, not try to to it all in one vacation.

And it would be nice to do a separate, modest getaway with you, the kids, + GF to do a little event to make them part of the new engagement with you and GF."

You knew this.  That is why you stayed in the closet until age 26.  Get a job and move out.  Heck move out of the south to a more friendly state with lots of jobs since you won't be coming back.  Inform everyone that you parents are reacting badly to the news and that you are looking for a bed for a couple of months.  Moving out of their abusive atmosphere, being honest with everyone, and moving forward into your future will all help your depression.  Also so will therapy and medications.

755,"Your husband needs to speak with a lawyer. He needs to know what his chances of adopting these kids are, gaining custody, and child support from his sister. He also needs to have a temporary custody order if he is going to enroll the kids in school or be able to handle their health care. He will need their medical files and social security, as well as school records and immunizations. 

He should not adopt the kids, realistically, if he will get support from his sister to help with the cost of caring for them. 

Also, if he is going to adopt the kids and you do not want to be a parent, then the agreement should be you both divorce before he adopts. You might get wrangled into child support payments if not. You should not be forced to pay for kids you did not want. "
756,"Very good point. I'd worry about, say, having a colicky baby with someone who flips out when they are stressed and frustrated. "

758,"He WILL escalate to PHYSICALLY HITTING YOU.

He will.

There is no ""if"" or ""maybe."" He gets violent with his surroundings to intimidate you. He spits in your face. He disrespects you. This is not a one-time incident. He will go back to being super duper sweet after this so you think ""oh he just had a bad day"" or ""I deserved it."" You don't deserve it, and normal people don't spit and insult when they have a bad day. At worst, normal people might be a little tense or snappy on a bad day and then apologize and own up to how they're wrong. He'll probably continue to make you feel stupid and immature for disagreeing with him, in between telling you how precious you are. Keeping you uncertain and confused is a big part of how these people trap you.

He WILL escalate things.

It's already escalated.

Get the fuck out! "
759,"Your grandfather shouldn't be officiating your wedding if he's causing this much of a stink over it, first of all. 

This is a non-negotiable issue. He is not invited. Whenever they bring it up with you, say ""Uncle is not invited. I'm not having this conversation."" 

I'm also very curious about how on earth someone managed to steal a *house.*"
760,"If your fiance is upset about the money, the value of her ring, and what a nicer, shinier diamond she COULD have had if you'd done what you did for your ex, then this is a horrible insight into her character and you should run for the hills.

But the way you've described it, that's not necessarily the case. From the sound of it, your sister described not only the *value* of the ring, but how sappy you were about it and how hard you worked and how long you saved to pay for it. I think your fiance feels like she interpreting your actions as less caring towards her than they were towards your fiancee. 

In a way this is similar to when my husband's brother comes to visit. I do most of the cooking at our house, and occasionally my husband will pitch in and make a casserole or chili or something easy. But when his brother comes to visit, he's busting out the grill, making apps and steak and seafood and buying a delicious cake for dessert. It makes me feel a bit slighted because he's putting ALL of this effort in for someone else when he doesn't do the same for me. Of course, I understand that seeing his brother is a special occasion and that's why he does those things.

In your case, I think you need to explain to your fiancee why things are different this time around. That you were young and stupid then, and couldn't think of any more meaningful way to express your love than an expensive ring. That now you realize there are more important ways to show love every day, and you didn't feel the need to make one grand gesture because you try to make her feel loved every day.

I would also ask her if you do things (or don't do things) that make her feel unimportant in day to day life. If she feels like you ignore her don't value her, she might be over-exaggerating the significance of the ring because it's the icing on the cake.

Ultimately, if she's hung up on the cost then she's showed you her true colors and you're better off without her. But if she is seeing the ring as a symbol of your love, and she feels like her symbol is less good so the love must also be less good, then I think some reassurance from you and some honest communication can probably get you both through this."
761,"Just remember when you give birth to notify the hospital that these family members are banned from visiting you.

764,"Thanks for all of the comments. It was really cathartic just to write this out, and the comments have been eye-opening. Definitely helpful to get neutral opinions/insight. It has also forced me into seeing some of the things I was in denial about; I knew they were there but I couldn't make myself acknowledge them (so afraid of that heartbroken feeling) so thank you all for taking the time to help me with that.

Ryan and I have decided to take some time apart - no spending time together, texting, talking, full no contact until I get back from Mexico, which is about two weeks from now. I honestly think this time apart will make him realize he doesn't want this relationship at all and I will realize this isn't fair to me and that from here on out I will have constant trust issues and we will end up breaking up. But, time will tell, I don't want to make a rash decision and give myself a chance to look back and wonder ""what if."" Again, this has been extremely difficult and I appreciate the support/insight from each and every one of you.

2) He has lived alone for long enough for it to make him kinda weird.  It happens.  Your presence threatens to expose his weirdness so he has kept his quirky compulsive ""alone behaviors"" hidden from you and feels suffocated."

I don't really have the money to move out I'm on minimum wage and I have my car and insurance to pay for monthly which I can't cancel.. I could stay with boyfriend and his mum (she's offered before) but they live an hours drive from my work but I might just have to."

774,"OK, people are going to rake you over the coals for getting yourself into this situation, but I can see you didn't want to rock the boat and didn't think it was a big deal until you woke up one day and realized how crazy this situation is.  Let's not talk about how you find yourself here, but instead, how to get a situation you would feel confident, comfortable, and safe in. 

- Start out by telling him you're thankful he has afforded you the opportunity to not work and travel with him.  But that you feel out of the loop and just want to know what the big picture is.  You two are married and that means being financially ""naked"" with your spouse.  

- Let him know you'd like to see the overall household budget, how savings are structured, etc.  For peace of mind.  You've been worried about this for a while and the only thing that will assuage your fears is knowledge.

- Let him know you feel picked apart when he scrutinizes your purchases.  If he is giving you this money to do with as you will (basically, your allowance), you'd rather set a number and get it auto-transferred into your own account.  It is belittling and makes you feel small and like a child when he combs over your purchases.  

If he pushes back on any of these things, demand therapy.  If he gets upset and you find yourselves arguing, say ""OK, we need to take a break from discussing this.  Let's pick back up (in 30 minutes, in the morning, tomorrow night).""  Stick to it.  Sometimes people need a break, but that doesn't mean you're letting him off the hook.

When you do get access to your own money, start saving some of it in your own personal savings account that only you have access to.  Just in case.  My mom always taught me to do this after she was stranded, in a situation much like yours, when she and my biodad were on the outs.  He left her high and dry because it was ""his"" money.  Mom had to panhandle with three kids to get across the country, to her parents' house.  Not saying this is going to happen to you, but it *could*, quite easily.  

ETA: I commented elsewhere, but you should immediately start either pulling out cash to stash (small - like $20 at a time) or gift cards, and hide them either scattered all over the house or in a safe location NOT YOUR HOUSE, like with a friend you trust.  "
775,"OP, I think she might be in love with you. You should marry her. "
776,"It doesn't sound like you are totally innocent either. You have to find another approach to telling your wife she needs to stop. My advice is to go see  counselor and talk it out. As others have said, resentment will ruin the marriage. Furthermore, it seems you may have other problems in the marriage as well."
777,"Because the wedding likely cost tens of thousands of dollars, and many people have collectively already spent thousands of dollars to come. Most likely, unless OP and everyone on the guest list is loaded, there won't be another wedding and even if there is, no one will come.  OP and his fiancé can expect little to no refunds on any of the deposits they've put down.

It's sad that the accident happened, but all involved will make a safe recovery. Were his life in jeopardy, it would be a different issue.

Threads like this are why r/relationships is hard to read sometimes.  "
778,"If she were here making the same exact post, I'd say the same things to her. I'm not picking sides. They both need to compromise, and if they can't, they either need to go to counseling for the sake of their kids, because the feelings of resentment that are going to spring up over something as petty as this isn't worth a timely and costly divorce. "
779,"So why not just give your wife a set amount of money each month instead of making her ask for money? Pay her what you would have to pay someone to take care of all the household tasks that she accomplishes.

Some things I think you should consider: Unilaterally changing the terms of your relationship after 7 years likely isn't going to go over well. Her not working enables her to take care of everything around the house, to spend whatever time you have off together, and may mean she's more emotionally present than someone who is working and needs to decompress and/or catch up on a million things when they've got down time. There may be consequences you don't anticipate - life may not run quite so smoothly as it currently does, she may wonder why you're suddenly worried about her ability to support herself if you two break up (and is this a real concern of yours, or is it a justification you're using because you don't want to deal with your emotional baggage regarding being asked for money?), she may feel like you bait and switched her, she may love her life and not want to work, she may feel hurt and sad.

You definitely need therapy if you're waking up in the middle of the night with flashbacks, and I think you need to deal with that stuff first and foremost. I mean, it's the very reason that you want to change the rules of the agreement you and your wife made. You would rather rearrange the entire structure of your relationship than deal with the trauma from your past.

781,"They're crazy. For thousands of years women weren't wearing bras or tops, and I doubt evolution has changed us to the point that exposure to a few breasts is going to damage a child. If anything it's probably healthy.

782,"Max attacked Mark. That is unambiguous; it was only luck that Max grabbed his shirt and not his flesh. You need to accept that you have a raised a dog who will attack a human being and move forward accordingly.

Welp knowing is half the battle.

You seem like the kind of dude to divorce her when she hits 40 to chase women half your age. Now it's stretch marks, then it will be wrinkles.

My advice is deprogram your mind from porn bodies/photoshop bodies and start sexualizing real bodies. Tbh loose skin and stretch make the world go round."

797,"When parents want their young children to do something, but the child doesn't want to do it, they sometimes manipulate using guilt and shame.

It's a really easy way to control your kid, because the kid doesn't have the mental or emotional capacity to deal with the manipulation.

(This is a big contributor to neuroticism and low self esteem in adults but lets skip past that point for a second)

Thing is...this doesn't really go away as you get older unless you make it go away.

I mean, how can you blame them?  It's a tried and true strategy.  Mom presses the guilt button.  Dad presses the guilt button.  And bam, you cave.  Why would they do anything else? 

Fortunately, you can now see it for what it is.  Your mom will cry.  Your dad will call you ungrateful.  It's predictable.  In a way, it's kind of funny because you know exactly what's going to happen.

Do not suck up.  Do not endure.  You're rewarding their behavior, which will make them repeat the behavior.

Your job is to remain the adult (ironic, huh?) and calmly explain your view.  And most importantly, don't waver, and don't come up with excuses for your feelings.

""Mom.  Dad.  This is my wedding.  I will invite who I want.  If you can't accept this, you are not invited to my wedding.  Frankly, I'm disappointed that you've taken the most special day of my life and made it about you.  You are not going to make me feel guilty about this, no matter what you do, because I know that I am being reasonable, and you are not being reasonable.  Let's talk when you're ready."""
798,Or look for hotels that charge by the week! They can be cheaper than living in an actual apartment.
799,"Based on your post history, you loved this girl 2 years ago, a few months ago and likely still do. You've also given her intimate massages and like a third of your posts mention her in some way. Finally, you destroyed your marriage to remain 'friends' with her.

Dude. You're obsessed. Get the fuck out of the ""best friend"" mentality. You're not best friends when you're this much into her. Her boyfriend has every right to demand that she doesn't see someone who's had feelings this strong for this long.

She rejected you when you told her you liked her and your way of coping is to remain 'best friends'. In reality you're doing whatever you can to stay relevant in her life and need to give her space. She is not interested in you romantically. She's interested in this guy. Let them have their shot at a relationship ."
800,"So stfu and stop calling her controlling.  I love how your tl;dr says nothing about you ignoring the potential mother of your child for weeks.  Jesus Christ man.  Take some responsibility for your actions.  Do you know how stressed out she must have been to have someone like you as the father who straight up runs off and abandons her during such a difficult time.  Forget emotional support, you straight up bolted. And you're not happy about the *way* she told your family????

This sounds like a fucking terrible idea. 

She's doing the hardest thing she ever had to do and will be in a state of anxiety and you think the best thing to do is to hijack her trip and make it about you?

This is not the occasion for surprises. Your plan lacks any empathy or compassion for how your sister might be feeling.

&gt;So I'm thinking do I just strike up a conversation and see how long it takes for her to figure out its ME?! 

This is just cruel. How could you think this was a good idea? Would you wanted to be treated this way?

&gt;What are some cool ways I could surprise meet my sister?! 

There aren't any in this scenario. The best thing you can do is leave her alone to do the trip she planned as she planned it and butt out. Let her have her own moment, for goodness' sake.

This really is such a terrible, terrible idea."
807,"Similar situation here.
I have been called more difficult even though i wasn't ever the one to take drugs, quit school, get in trouble with the law, etc. I'm simply not willing to shut up when i think differently while my brother just lets them spout bullshit.

I only recently made some peace with everything but that's only due to me taking a step back from my parents and seeing them more as friends than actual family.
Hopefully you can find a way to deal with things too, i know how much hearing this hurts."

He should not have sent the birth certificate, y'all are allowed to make your kids last name Jello if you want, he doesn't get a say. He also doesn't get a say about you changing your last name, because he's not the one who married you. You need to have a serious talk with your husband about setting boundaries with Mike"
809,"I can understand the parents: if they side with him, then everything's perfect: the son didn't do anything creepy, and it's not like the daughter is lying: she just dreamt it! Nothing needs fixing, the family is perfect! On the other hand, if they allow the possibility that he did creep on her, then, well.

Maybe if the alternative to accusing him would be to accuse her, they would hesitate before siding with him, but as it is, they have the perfect opportunity to bury their heads in the sand."

814,"You don't get credit for not doing something shitty up until the point you do something shitty. If you wanted to talk to her about it you could have done it before you continued searching for evidence. My point about the unlocked phone isn't that you didn't/don't snoop, it is that that she knows you could and doesn't have anything to hide. 

I've been with my husband for ages and he knows why I take photos occasionally and has never been suspicious I was lying. When I was her age I took them because I was hot and knew I might want pictures of my pre-childbearing body at some point in the future. Now I take them to show myself that my mom-bod isn't as bad as I worried it would be. When I am feeling insecure and hormonal every few months I like knowing they exist. I know I could probably post them online and get validation if I wanted it. My husband knows this and is okay with it. "
815,"I am not a doctor but I am a recovering EDNOS.  You have legitimate concerns.  

Worst part is that getting someone with an eating disorder help when they don't want it is nigh on impossible...it's as bad as any sort of drug addiction.

I would recommend starting off by having a very calm and open discussion about your concerns and offer your support.  Ask if she's got anything that's bothering her, etc.  If she doesn't open up, offer helping her to find a counselor or someone she might be more comfortable speaking to.

Eating disorders are bad news but are easier to control if they're caught and treated sooner rather than later.

Best of luck.  &lt;3"
816,"I thought it was common knowledge. Even if not, a simple google search would prove that she's quite correct."
817,"OP, it sounds like this hurt in part because you share (to some degree) the same doubts about what your profession means about you as a person.

So let's unpack that: 

Western people, and Americans in particular, conflate *vocation* with *ambition*.

Ambition is a valuable trait - it's a sign that you will constantly improve your situation and the situation of those around you.  It gives you social Prestige, because you're an energetic, driving force in your community.

Society spoon-feeds its members with *conventional* markers of ambition - High Powered Professions.  Lawyers, Doctors, Politicians, *successful* Entrepreneurs, and to a lesser degree Engineers.

You don't 'fit' the conventional markers of ambition, and **ignorant** people, people who aren't aware of their cultural biases, will conclude that you're not ambitious.  That you have no drive.  That you're simple and boring.

You're struggling because on the one hand, you know that they're wrong.  On the other hand, their 'facts' are right.

So ask yourself this question:  What are you ambitious about?

You're certainly ambitious about living a truly happy, centered life. You made a career choice that would allow you the peace of mind to be happy when you're not working.

What else are you doing?  Do you have hobbies?  Passions?  Are you a history buff?  Can you tell good stories?  Do you run a local Yoga meetup group?  Do you garden?  Do you woodwork?  In what other ways are you ambitious?

Find those passions within yourself and keep pursuing them.

Here's the thing: your GF is probably also conflicted - her friends are saying the 'normal' things, but she knows you, and the mold that they're trying to fit you into isn't right.

So maybe make a point of that the next time you two are doing something that you both love.  Point out that you have ambitions that aren't career-related, but are life related.  Point out that you're a postman because it's satisfying work *that allows you to pursue your true ambitions*.

My guess is that your GF will also break the chance of this dumb cultural bias and start to be more confident in *her* feelings that you're a worthy partner.

Good luck."
818,Let's not confuse stupidity with courage 
819,"&gt; I don't want her there but he insisted she's coming because Shawn is the best man and their child is our flower girl.

Not only did he cheat on you and lie about it, but one of the most important parts of recovering from infidelity is making your partner and their comfort level your top priority when it comes to the affair partner. He doesn't care how you feel about this. He cares about what he wants. 

You've been together for eight years. He's been your significant other since you were children. You're so entwined with him that it's hard for you to picture a life without him, but honey, if you marry this man, *this* is going to be your life. 

Please don't do this to yourself. You'll wake up five years from now with a baby and the sick swimming feeling of despair in your stomach when you see his text messages about sleeping with someone else."
820,"Not even a little bit. Get a grip! Mixing family and business is rarely a good idea. 

This is supposed to be an exciting time for her and you've made it all about yourself, your career and your feelings.

Do the decent thing and apologize to your daughter for being so selfish and maybe she'll invite you to participate in the role of mom, not realtor. 


And get some new friends who won't just tell you what you want to hear."
821,"One issue might be that she has more control over passing gas than you do. It is VERY rare for me to pass gas accidentally. The idea of doing it without realizing it's happening (while awake) is just bizarre to me. And yet this thread is full of people whose experience is exactly the opposite...who can't hold it in for more than a few seconds.

If your wife is like me, she might also assume that everyone is that way. That would mean, in her eyes, she has told you multiple times she doesn't appreciate you passing gas in her presence and yet you are consciously choosing to do so, repeatedly. Perhaps the situation would improve if you explained to her you really can't feel it coming most of the time.

Secondly, what do you do to accommodate her preferences/discomfort? Let's say one slips out...do you apologize and excuse yourself? Or do you giggle and tell her to lighten up? When you DO feel one coming, do you leave the room? Or do you sit there and hope she doesn't notice?

While you're right that this is just a normal bodily function, it is obviously something she takes a different view of than you. You see it kind of like yawning, something that just happens and is no big deal. She sees it like pooping. It's no big deal, but it's also something you don't want to do in front of other people unless it's absolutely necessary.

Maybe if you make more concessions to her side and try to be more conscious of when it's happening, she will feel like you respect her POV and get less angry when one accidentally slips out.

The sleeping thing, though, that is ridiculous."
822,"&gt; ""Oh, no,"" she said to me, squinting as she peered intently at my face with her bright pink cheeks and glittery blue eyeshadow. ""You didn't put it on right. I can't see the bloody stuff at all.""

823,"Oh honey.

Please know that divorce is complicated. It's never just one thing that leads to it. We tend to hyper focus on one thing while we're in the middle of it all, but it's never just one thing. If your sister and her ex husband weren't meant to be, that had a lot less to do with you than you're thinking.

Your sister is an angel. Were it me and my sister, I would do the same thing, no question. It's a no brainer. I have a toddler and am currently pregnant, and if there was anything I could do to save my sister's life, including an abortion, I would do it. "

LEAVE.  Or at least get a job and start stashing money away.  Make sure he has absolutely no access to it otherwise you will literally be trapped forever.  He will not surrender on this.  Why would he?  He has it so good.  He's not EVER going to willfully give up the control he has over you and the relationship.

She needs to stop focusing on your breasts. It's bizarre and creepy that she is obsessing about your breasts so much so that she is calling you a whore. Ask her why she can't stop thinking about your body, that she damn well knows you weren't trying to breastfeed the baby so why the hell is she making an issue about your breasts when there isn't an issue.

Would you be willing to let this other woman leave your life and push your girlfriend to be better? She is severely depressed, and I know everyone else is saying do what is right for you, and I agree, but honestly, I don't think you should leave this relationship to enter into another relationship, I don't think it would work.

848,"I know a lot of people are asking you to suck it up, and telling you to not talk about it until after he proposes. I think this is a mistake. 

Something as big as a marriage proposal should not be a surprise and should be discussed beforehand. How will you two last if you can't talk out something like this? 

If you go to him, I would just lay it all out and ask him whether he bought that ring for you, or had just forgotten to show you the new merch he bought. If he says that it's an engagement ring for you, then I'd make sure to say a few sappy things about how you love him and can't wait for him to propose. Then bring up that even though you're excited, you can't help but feel hurt that your tastes and wants weren't considered at all when he picked out a ring. You explained yourself really well above. It isn't that you want an expensive ring, or that you're being materialistic. It's that final fantasy is significant to only him, not the both of you as a family. 

Talk to him. If he's marriage material and if you talk to him gently, you both should be able to solve this. "
849,"I was down with a knee surgery for 2 months in my house. I had a 7 month recovery (after 2 months I could at least go places). I'm 25M. I can count on 10 fingers how many times people came to my house to hang out. It's not that I have shit friends, just friends who work and have things they need to do. I can understand that. This guy can take care of himself, I got by just fine. Coming over as frequently as you do is a very nice gesture, but that's too much.

This is why books and videos games are a thing. It's a fantastic way to pass the time. How much time are you spending with this guy when you're over there? How much time do you have between work, this guy, and your boyfriend? Are you spending less time with your bf since you've been over there?

856,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, antidepressants? It sounds like you're leaving out a lot of previous history here in regards to his mental health. Anyway, that doesn't matter because this issue is far beyond reddit's pay grade. Your steps should be
1. Get your husband far away from you and your child- I know he seems stable now but he could snap again (hopefully he is understanding and does not take offense to this, but absolutely do not compromise on this issue. Don't keep the baby away from him, but make sure all visits are supervised.

2. Get him evaluated for mental health disorders (bipolar, borderline personality disorder, depression, etc) and make sure he has a counselor who he can work with to talk about his issues. See if he will be kept on anti depressants or be given new medication, and make sure he is taking them every day (physically have someone watch him take them).

3. Get a lawyer and figure out how to liquidate assets since he will need bail once he is arrested.

4. Enroll yourself in counseling. This is an incredibly difficult situation and you need someone to help you through it.

5. Figure out how you are going to support yourself through this period of time. Where will you and your child be living? Where will your husband be living? How are you going to pay for his legal and medical expenses, along with medication costs, therapy costs, and the cost of raising a child? This is the point where you cannot be ashamed of the situation and asking for help. If you need to borrow from family/friends, do it. If you need to reach out to advocacy organizations, new parent help groups, charities, food banks, government assistance programs, etc, do it. Now is not the time to be superwoman and take everything on by yourself. You need a team of people helping you get your life back on track.

I wish you the best and I hope your family gets the help it needs to get through this. Stay strong and remember to take advantage of all the resources you have.

857,"&gt;We have discussed abortion a lot of time and have told her my rather conservative opinion on the topic,

Reason why she didn't tell you.

Also because it's none of your business.

&gt;I don't want to confront her, 

Good, it has nothing to do with you, and she did nothing wrong, so there is nothing to confront her about.

&gt;but I think it should come from her, and I think I see it as a matter of trust.

Why should it come from her? It has nothing to do with you, and is not relevant to you. She shouldn't have to discuss this with you.

&gt;What should I do?

Nothing. Work with yourself to get over it. "

865,"I'm not great with faces so I totally get this being an issue. In your retelling I do see some things that might have helped you to smooth things over. 

""So I introduced myself and she said ""no its me, (name), do you not remember me?"" and it took me a long time""

In social situations where things are moving fast, a long time to recognize someone, especially due to a change that is super politically sensitive right now, is going to look a little bad. When she identified herself, you could have just touched your forehead and gone ""I'm so bad with faces! I'm sorry Sara.""

Sure, everyone might know/think its because of the hijab. But it still makes things smoother socially. 

""because she looks completely different with a hijab on and I still wasn't convinced she was the same person.""

You don't have to be convinced. She told you who she was! This could also be a sensitive point because some rhetoric against religiously based headcoverings include the idea that people may use them to disguise their appearance. Even unintentionally, awkward and fraught with bigger issues.

When I did clue in I said something like ""oh wow you look completely different with the hijab"" like a fucking idiot

""fucking idiot"" feels a bit strong, but in general when you've just made a minor social gaffe like not remembering someone it isn't best to then say that the changes they've undergone have caused you to have trouble. Just take the mild amount of social blame that comes with it ""being bad with faces"" or ""super tired"" or ""nervous about remembering everyone's names"" or ""anxious about being back"" or even if you could pull it off, needing a new glasses prescription. Its just a social nicety.

""and everyone in the room turned and gave me a death stare like they were horrified I would point it out.""

Well, in general it isn't great to point out changes to people's appearances, especially people you don't know well/have just had a bit of social tension with other a politically charged change. But it is equally rude to give people death stares, so not cool on them.

The above is all just sort of musings on the social situation as you described it and ways that you might be able to make it a bit easier on yourself in the future if you have difficulty with changes in appearance. I've learned these through repeated use, believe me.

Unless there's something super off in your retelling, though, I don't know why everyone would be reacting so badly. I can understand the woman being a bit upset- it was an awkward exchange, and there's also an element of ""i'm so forgettable"" or even feeling some isolation from the group, like you obviously must not have considered her ""one of the team"" or something. And when you already look different, those feelings can be pretty sensitive. But you certainly didn't intend any of that and you apologized in what I'm assuming what a respectful and sincere manner, so the issue should just drop.  I don't get where sexism comes in to it, unless there's a piece missing in your retell.

As to where to go from here, you can go to HR and head off a complaint, you can apologize again, saying you've thought more about it and didn't mean to make anything awkward and are sorry and want to move forward on a good foot, you can wait to see if it dies down, etc. I hope whatever you choose works to make this situation resolve well for everyone!"

So, I don't know if this is helpful, but I'm a sub who is also a HUGE HUGE pacifist and a very gentle person. In my partner, I also value someone gentle, patient, caring and non-violent.

That being said, I like being dominated during sex... and only during sex. Healthy BDSM does NOT have to mean dating someone violent, angry, confrontational. It can be dating someone who is a gentle but willing to stretch out of their typical comfort zone to try things in bed. Just because you like something in the privacy of your sex life doesn't change who you are as a person.

Liking something sexually doesn't mean you have to change your values about that subject. Just because it turns you on DOESN'T mean you have to condone the way your boyfriend acts now. Your choices are not ""stay with angry, aggressive boyfriend and have great sex"" or ""date a gentle man and have boring sex."" There's a man out there who will reflect your values AND be able to satisfy your kink."

Just a forewarning: There is a chance that they will not take you seriously, unfortunately, since you are a male. Don't be shocked if that happens, but you still need to tell them to get this out in the open ASAP. Predators thrive on secrecy and their victims keeping quiet--and the SIL was being predatory. If she ever does something like that again, you need to say in a loud, firm voice, ""Leave me alone!"" or, ""Quit kissing me!"", or ""Get your hands off me!""  Even if you'd feel ridiculous saying it, it is a way to bring attention to the situation so she will hopefully stop."

And you've felt bad enough about giving her that money that you came here to ask for advice. 

Look, nobody said you don't give your wife enough money. The point is that she should have independent access to money that isn't ""given"" to her by you on a ""need money"" basis.

Paying for family to go on vacation is a different story. His family is paying their own way, you're asking to pay several thousand dollars to take your family to Disney.  I think that's pretty fair for him to say no to something like that.  That being said, I assume he is totally controlling finances (as a 38 year old dating a 22 year old typically does), and he treats it as his money only.

So mentally, you feel like you've moved on - but that lizard brain is still trying to get you to mate with this dude, and to that end it's pumping you full of powerful bonding hormones like oxytocin. Oxytocin is so powerful it literally makes new mothers *forget* how brutal giving birth is - it's a helluva drug. It makes you overlook faults in a person, think about them obsessively, feel like a twitterpated teenager.

The good news is that it's temporary. It will die if you don't feed it, and if you get *really* lucky, you'll walk in on him doing something gross, like hocking up a big loogie and then just swallowing it, or something, and it'll vanish so quickly you'll swear you felt a breeze as it jumped out the window.

I should never claim that I want a partner because I’m not even close to being one. I don’t deserve emotional support or to be treated nicely because I’m a useless f-ing b.

910,"&gt;How do I make my anger stop

You can be angry at him. He honestly sounds like a raging douchebag. 

I get the feeling from everything here that he just has special snowflake syndrome. He wants to be different, to be special, to have people see him as out of the norm....whether or not he actually is. He spends too much time on Tumblr by the sounds of it.

I've been active in the LGTBQ community for a long time, basically since I came out as bi. People like this give the community a bad name, and that really isn't fair. 

You need differentiate between this guy and all people from a group. If one person commits a crime, for example, it doesn't make everyone in that person's group a criminal. 

He's an asshole. Not all transgenders. Him.

It could very well be that this will be the outcome here, and if that happens, don't blame yourself. Your daughter makes a decision based on the information about her father and stepmom she now has, and that is her right. Your ex cheated and this is a consequence he has to live with.

924,"Update 1 (don`t know where to write it): The drama continues. My dad came and told me he spoke with grandpa. Grandfather agreed to talk to me again if my father leaves the house and the company. That way, the children would remain here in the house and my stepmom too, for the time being, since she takes care of them.

It seems all of my grandpas anger is now directed to my father, because dad hit him and left him a black eye. My stepmom told dad that if he leaves, she will get a divorce. It seems that grandpas plan all along was to destroy their marriage, not evict the children. 

I told dad that that I own the house and company, and I want everybody to stay in the house, the familys house. I want him to keep the job in the company and keep his actual high salary, which it is high enough to support the family confortably. 

The earnings of the company were all for grandpa, now they will be mine and I will be fair with everybody. The earnings are huge enough for me to buy another property for myself, paid for my college and expenses, and set colleges funds for the children.  I told him we can work this out. It is not fair that I am queen of the castle and my siblings are send into poverty. I told him I will get a lawyer and he agreed. 

Dad was quite happy with my ideas but he cannot believe I can resist my grandpas silent treatment. I told him I will learn how to. Dad calmed down and said he was proud of me, but my stepmom is pissed off and wants to dump him for wanting to leave. It is a disaster. Now they are arguing and I am afraid they are going to wake up the baby (evicting the one year old would have being grandpas most evil moment).

I didnt respond my bf texts. All he talks about is the money. I am afraid my stepmom and father will divorce over this.

Grandpa and I arent talking. I will become one of the only ones that doesnt do what he wants. It is quite sad for me, but I dont have a choice.

You say that breaking up is not an option, but just understand that he has deeply rooted values about not spending money, and even worse than that, he wants someone else to spend instead of him. He has the attitude, 'what is yours is mine and what's mine is my own.' 


and his attitude when you made a reasonable request is completely out of order. 

my SO spends about 4 nights of the week with me, he always brings food if I ask him to pick up stuff. He-without asking- has taken responsibility to pick up fuel for the fire , in the wintertime.

Plus he will often insist on pay for groceries if he happens to be with me when I am picking up stuff. If it is a big shop, he will chip in. Your boyfriend is completely out of order in this. Sadly he is much less nice a person than you believe. "
927,"you don't want to imperil this very old relationship, but what about the welfare and safety of the child?"

930,"It seems like he's just waiting for you to break up with him, OP. He's unapologetic about planning a trip after making excuses not to go on one with you, and straight up lied about cancelling.

936,"Not wearing a condom, then walking out on her and blocking her for weeks is not fair either."
937,"I think opening up to your therapist about the true extent of your situation is an excellent idea. The more she knows, the more she can help you out of your situation. Don't try and sugarcoat things for her; be honest and real with her.  If you're not comfortable saying the words out loud (plenty of people have trouble with that), you can show her this thread, since you've articulated the issue very well here.


&gt;And my feeling sad is a sign of how I don't ""really want"" to do better. Because if I did, then the yelling wouldn't make me feel sad

&gt;And he says that if I really had self-worth, the things he says wouldn't hurt me.

I...I just have flames on the side of my face from how wrong he is. How completely cruel he is for saying those things to you. 

Feeling bad because someone yells at your or says mean things to you is a universal reaction. Some of the most emotionally healthy people I know feel bad when they get yelled at. This is a completely, utterly, entirely normal and legitimate way to feel. When he tells you otherwise, it is to silence you and keep you compliant. Please don't believe his BS.

&gt; And I tell him that I'm trying to build up a belief in myself and my worth, but it's really hard to do when my partner keeps calling me names

Please trust yourself here. You are absolutely correct. You are reasonable to feel this way.

You are not selfish for wanting your partner to be kind, supportive, and not cruel to you. Seriously, that is the absolute minimum, the most basic standards for how a decent partner should treat their spouse. 
"
938,"This would literally be the one time that I ask...how hard does he hit? Not because it's excusable, but because it might be explainable as something other than abuse. I've run into a similar situation with a very close friend, and it turned out that his girlfriend just had literally no clue how martial arts training goes, and legitimately thought it was a fun way to ""help.""

He started taking classes, and about a week in, she started SURPRISE ATTACKS! (they're still practicing form a week in unless it's a McDojo, I've been told. You don't start sparing for quite awhile.) Now, I've met a lot of goofy guys that really do forget how big they are compared to someone else, especially when a ball of silly girlfriend is flying at them making ""WAACHAAAA"" sounds. I've also met a lot of tiny girls who don't realise how hard they really hit. She came flying in and slapping and punching, and he shoved her back. Not because he was abusive or into shoving or anything, but because HE DIDN'T WANT HER TO DO THAT AGAIN. 

They were really weird for awhile, and she'd keep trying to ""spar"" with him in her own way. I say that in quotes because when he finally sat her down to dinner and demanded to know ""What in the actual fuck is wrong with you?"" she was actually surprised that he wasn't interested and didn't find it helpful. Turns out, in her super enthusiastic little head, he would do super awesome great at his sparring matches and in tournaments if he was used to surprise attacks. 

After that he made her sit in on a lesson so she could understand that this was less The Karate Kid and more like LEARNING LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE. After she gained a better understanding of what he was doing, she also understood why what she had been doing wasn't just wrong/incorrect, it was USELESS. I've known them both a long time, and neither of them are bad people. Neither of them would hurt a fly, normally. But she has a history of getting SUPER excited about *helping.* 

So this would be my advice to you, OP. Find out if your boyfriend is just SUPER excited about *helping* you. Maybe even see if you can arrange with your sensei for him to sit in on a class so that he gets a better idea of the discipline involved. That he hasn't tried this crap again after you told him to stop is hugely important. 

We've all done really stupid, misguided things in our lives when trying to be enthusiastic about something we don't understand. Maybe, just maybe...this is his.

...and if he gives you too much pushback or starts degrading you, ditch his ass. It's not unheard of for an abusive partner to show their true colours after two years, but this feels too much like he was just stuck in his own head about being an enthusiastic little helper. "
939,"&gt; I couldn't care about the value of ring. What I care about is that he always tends to pick things he thinks are cool and doesn't compromise for what I like, which can be hurtful. E.g he took me to a roller coaster park for my birthday when I'm afraid of roller coasters, because he forgot.

/u/RaenBoe says this in a comment further up the chain. I think this fanboy ring thing is actually a larger red flag than is being realized. 
"
940,"of *course* he got scammed. He would have been better off spending that on a professional, at least he would have gotten sex out of that deal. he should absolutely file a claim with his bank unless he's made of money."
941,"...biting someone like that is...a really bizarre reaction. I had to read this several times to make sure I was seeing it right. Does she have any kind of mental issues? Biting someone at 17, for 'sneaking up on them', is not normal. For that reason alone I'd suggest you tell your mom what happened. Your sister might genuinely need some help here.

Edit to add: For everyone saying things like ""oh but she *felt* snuck up on, maybe he really startled/scared her"", whether or not that's true, biting someone is the last thing probably 99% of people would think to do. Seriously. Think about it. Someone 'sneaks up on' you, you're startled/scared, you feel a hand on your shoulder - do you *bite*? I'm guessing almost all of you, in that exact moment, would turn, shove, run, punch - not bite. It's the *biting* part, not the being startled part, that's *really fucking weird*."
942,"At some point, and at our age, constant innuendos start to sound childish and attention seeking.  Come up with a list of all the reasons you love him, and when an innuendo pops into your head, give him a nonsexual compliment instead.  Leave him love notes in his lunch or dresser.  He knows you love his dick, so now start showing him you love everything else about him too.  Don't cut back sex and still give him some sexual compliments, but tell him you love his passion when you're in bed, not his dick.  Etc."
943,"BIL's cat peed in our bed so we're sleeping on these two couches in the living room. Fiancé couldn't sleep last night so he stayed up watching TV, and I put my earplugs in and went to sleep.

Next thing I know, he's shaking me awake. I used to have pretty bad night terrors as a kid, I still have them sometimes and wake up screaming, flailing, trying to fight off my abuser. This time I was just making little ""scared sounds"" according to my fiancé. I sat up, confused, and he just gave me a long hug and then I passed back out.

A few hours later, my MIL is talking loudly in the kitchen and I wake up, kind of grouchy. He comes over, pets my hair, and brings me a glass of water.

It was just so sweet. They were simple acts, but they just touched me, you know? After years of him trying to wake me up while I scream and try to fight him, he still loves me. After all the times he's had to hold my arms back until I wake up so he doesn't get punched, he still loves me. He doesn't get angry or frustrated or sick of my ""problems."" Instead of telling me I need to ""get over"" being molested as a child, he sits with me and holds me close when I wake up in a cold sweat, or sobbing, or screaming.

Can you imagine how annoying it must be? Being woken up at 3am on a work night by a screaming, violent person you have to restrain until the person you love wakes up? Every other relationship I've had, I've made the choice to sleep on the couch when I'm really stressed out. Stress exacerbates my night terrors, and I try to be courteous and not subject anyone else to my crazy.

But he won't let me. He tells me to come to bed, he holds me close and whispers that he loves me no matter what. He rubs my back until I fall asleep and the stress drains out of me like water slipping through cupped hands.

Find someone good. Find someone who loves the real you. **Find someone who isn't afraid of your demons. Find someone who will help you fight them.**"
944,"&gt; How is it possible for single people with regular 40 hour work weeks to

They live like single people. That means while they take care of their singular needs they also aren't looking at a lump at home every night and resenting him/her for not contributing. 

If you think she's going to work all day, come home tired, cook, put the clothes in the wash, scrub the toilet, and plan breakfast and lunch for the next day, while you ass sit, then you'll be on your way to divorce. She's going to meet a guy at work who will pull his weight at home. "

949,"Hey OP, I was recruited by a cult a few years ago (my post about my experience was actually my very first post on Reddit but that was on a different account). It was a religious cult and I come from a religious background and am very knowledgeable about different belief systems, etc. as well as being the type of person who loves a good argument. As soon as I realized it was a cult (about 10 minutes after I showed up, when they stuck me in a room by myself with two girls who instantly started berating me with talking points) I really wanted to stick around and argue with them because I know my stuff and thought it would be fun. However, I resisted the urge to stay or go back, because cults are dangerous. It doesn't matter how smart, aware, etc. you are - once you realize that it's a cult, the best course of action is to steer very fucking clear of it. This may damage your relationship with your mom, but that is part of the damage that cults inflict on people, unfortunately. Stay away. "
950,"This. Just be yourself, those who are worth it will learn who you really are. Of course, if you want them to. If you don't, just separate work from personal life and let them think whatever. That's how I deal."
951,"Maybe approach it by having a talk about your budget? You two are obviously not communicating well in this area. Reviewing the whole budget, where you lay out all income and expenses, and where the extra money gets split 50/50 or some other proportion that you both feel is fair would be good. This way he can see that you really don't have money and that he is being objectively unfair about it.

How old is your child? It's great when one parent can afford to stay home with the child, but taking care of a child isn't easy, and it can also be a curse as much as a blessing. How much time each day is he spending with the child? Does he get personal alone time (not just during nap time) where he can unplug? Maybe he's sort of hitched his emotional wagon to this extra money, where getting new video games or other things the one thing he gets for himself where he feels like he can unplug. Obviously, it's selfish of him to expect to have all of the extra and you to have none of it (you work all day and need to do things for yourself too), and if you aren't budgeting for new toys for your child and he uses all the extra money that would be used for that, that's bad too. But, I think he's using the money to make up for something else that isn't going well for him, especially given his emotional and irrational defense and the fact that he's just going to do it anyway (ouch!)."
952,Your request was not unreasonable. I'd say you should proceed by asking him to have a proper discussion about spitting grocery costs. If he acts like and oversized baby again then you need to do some serious thinking.

So...some tough love from one Rottie lover to another.

Additional exercise is a MUST. I know you're tired after a long day at work, and maybe even your dog seems like he's ready to just have some table scraps and chill infront of the tube, but when you have a large dog like him, it is not an option. They need exercise, they need socialization. It sounds like he doesn't like smaller dogs, so definetely stick to taking him on long walks DAILY if you can. Large dogs that don't get the exercise they need can very well turn aggressive, and it seems that while Max was protecting you in this case, he isn't the warmest and fuzziest with strangers and other pets. I STRONGLY recommend some additional training, even just to make sure he doesn't get startled and attacks a stranger or a kid that runs up to pet him, or hug him. It's a must, especially when you own a breed like that.

It sounds like you and your dog have a strong bond, and that's awesome-- but the things I described are 'must do's', not options. Good luck to you and Max!"

956,"If I was impregnated by a man, and his response to my telling him was to walk out and block me, it would be devastating.  I can't blame her for letting other people know what happened, because she sure as hell needs some support right now.

Maybe it's not yours, and you have every right to ask for a paternity test, but if you had sex without a condom you did realize this was a possibility - right?  (Heck, even with a condom.  Multiple types of protection are ideal!)  If you don't want to be involved in the child's life you can make that choice, but you may still be on the line for financial support - depending on the laws in your area.  "
957,"&gt; I thought it would be a great bonding experience for us...

That might be another reason for her to choose someone else. This is supposed to be about your daughter and her husband's first home. It's supposed to be a bonding experience for THEM. It's clear from your post and the words you use (betrayal, devastated, etc.) that this would have been an emotional experience for you and that you were already too invested in their decision to buy a home. They need a realtor to guide them through it, not a mom. They need someone who is NOT going to have an opinion about what is right and wrong, who is going to stay calm and cool, who is not going to get emotional, etc. It doesn't sound like you would have been able to be that person for them. 

I think your daughter deserves a lot of respect for making this decision like an adult with her husband, for choosing to respect their own financial privacy as a family, and for having what I'm sure was a hard conversation with you.

You have every right to feel whatever you feel. You don't have a right to make this happy moment for them about you or to do anything to make them feel guilty about making a decision that it was their right to make."
958,"Oooo I agree, I didn't think of that. He'd probably say ""Well I can't sleep with other people and you know I CANT LIVE WITHOUT SEX OR MASTURBATE soooo time to take one for the team"" and guilt her... 

Dump him. ASAP. "
959,"OP, I agree that you should talk to your sister about how you feel, but be really careful not to put the burden of your guilt on her. Telling her that you hate yourself will only add to her pain. Don't make it her job to resolve your emotions about her difficult and selfless sacrifice. "

Your mother and sister are nuts. NUTS. Off the chart creepy nuts. Pain meds? Jealousy? Who knows why, and who cares? 
Don't apologise to your sister. Don't respond to any of your mother's texts. Calmly tell your Dad what happened and ask for his help moving out when you come back from holiday. In the next two days, get anything important or irreplaceable of yours out of the house and store it in a safe place. A small storage unit, or a friend's house. 

Enjoy your holiday, and block your mother and sister on your phone and social media while you're away. You say you love your family very much, but they aren't showing you the same love. "

964,"Trust issue.... once the trust is broken, it's almost impossible to gain it back for some people. I'm NOT saying that your marriage is definitely doomed, but for some people, it only takes 1 time and they'll never trust again no matter what. "

966,"Have you just ... asked him? ""Honey, can you help me pay for these medical bills?"""
967,"First of all, your ex is a moron. He should not have treated you that way, and he was wrong in not treating you like something special when you put everything into the relationship. However, please do not judge all men just because of the attention you are getting.

You said yourself that you are doing more to take care of yourself physically - not piling on makeup, but some grooming, exercise, and putting in effort. That in itself makes someone more attractive because it means that they care about how they present themselves to the world. Also, physical attraction IS important in a romantic relationship, or you would just be friends. The guys that are attracted to you now aren't bad people, or purely superficial, it just means that they are attracted to you because you take care of yourself and they think you're cute. And, trust me when I say, they are also definitely attracted to your personality - even the hottest girl on the planet becomes dull and uninteresting when they are not fun to be around and have nothing intelligent to say.

You need to separate the way your ex felt with other men. Your ex is a douche, and took advantage of you while you were dating, and is now crawling back when his new girlfriend dumped him. Forget about him. But realize that there are other good guys out there, and there are other people that will be honored to call you their girlfriend and treat you that way.

I would say, the way you acted around your ex basically made him feel like he had a right to feel better than you - you let him get away with treating you like crap. you thought you weren't good enough for him and so you were happy enough to be with him regardless of how he treated you. That's bullshit. You need to demand that your SO treat you like something special (and vice versa). You shouldn't date someone that lets you feel like you aren't good enough for them. Find someone that treats you like an equal, and that feels equally special to be dating you as you do about dating them. Also, there is nothing wrong with not dating for a while until you feel ready, don't feel like you have to. "

Are you actually bad at math, or is this like the ""I'm a slow learner according to my husband"" thing?

That line from the original post really jumped out at me. That added with the encouraging you to drop out of high school to move across the country away from your family and friends seems like a bad combination. 

You don't need to be good at math to handle finances. You work your job, they direct deposit the money into your bank account, and you can check the balance daily from anything that allows you to access the internet. Making sure you have enough to pay a bill or for food is simple subtraction that you can do on a calculator.

He doesn't want you to learn how to live on your own. He doesn't want you to be near friends. He doesn't want you to be able to go out of the house without clearing it with him (telling you the public transportation is bad and that you can use his car when he's not at work). He doesn't want you to have your own financial security. 

He doesn't want to stress you out by making you get a job, but stressing you out because you have to raise a baby all by yourself is fine? That sounds like nothing but an excuse to keep you from getting a job.

Yes, a wife can legally move out of her husband's house if she wants. She's his wife, not his property. 

Like, it's not your fault. I don't want to sound like I'm coming down hard on you. I'm just pointing to all the things I've seen that make it sound like he's purposely trying to keep information from you to keep you dependent on him. It's not that you don't know things, it's that it sounds like he's not *letting* you learn things. "

976,"They have a beach house that they let the entire family use. Three or four months before my bachelorette party, I asked them if we could use the house on that date for the bachelorette party. I specifically told them: “Hotels are relatively cheap right now so there is absolutely no pressure. We can get a hotel but I want to first check to see if we could use the house.” They told me it was totally fine and that the house would be ours that weekend. 

Then, 2 weeks before the bachelorette party, they call and tell me we can’t use the house anymore. They claimed it was because they wanted to be there for that same uncle’s surgery which I would understand. But his surgery is going to be in a town 4+ hours away, at a hospital that is 5 minutes from my aunt’s huge house that they routinely stay at [and close by other family members who have offered to house them], and is happening 5 days *after* the bachelorette party. 

Now all the beach houses in the area are booked and the hotel prices have soared out of my range. My maid of honor is trying very hard (she is a wonderful person and the best MoH ever) but it is really tough this last minute. So I'm not sure what we are going to do.  I'd do something local but we are spread out over several states and that area was the best meeting point for everyone.
"
977,"Yeah, I hear what you are saying.  I'm not sure if I would bulk reading into that though.  Hell, or even TV for that matter (depending on the type of gaming).  

Most of the gaming addicts aren't addicted to single player experiences, it ends up being the shooters, the MMOs, the MOBA type of games.  What is unique about these is 

1. People rely on you and you feel a bond and a need to play and keep them happy.
2. The content rarely changes, you're doing the same thing over and over again.
3. It's addictive and provides you with 'rewards' to keep playing and engaging.

I'd argue that books at least increase your vocabulary and expand your views on the world.  Depending on the type of TV you're watching, you may be learning from documentaries etc.  Gaming is just purely for enjoyment and really has no benefit at all, other than the enjoyment you get from playing (which should not be negated).

I still game...hell, I took a weekend off to play XCOM 2 and I loved it.  After I was done though, I couldn't help a nagging feeling that I really accomplished nothing and it was wasted time (other than what I enjoyed from leisure).

I suppose, like everything else in life...balance."

984,"Congrats! I know the feeling of having the other person finally come around to wanting a relationship too, especially when you were quicker to realize your feelings.

The only advice I have for you is to make sure you aren't living in fear of losing her. You say you can be a bit spineless when it comes to Erin, so make sure you grow and strengthen that spine. Don't be afraid to communicate your important feelings or thoughts, even if she may disagree with them. 

It's a lesson I'm still learning with my partner, but every time I speak up, I feel better for doing so, and our relationship grows. We've promised each other both to have the courage to bring up the hard conversations and to be receptive of hard conversations.

988,"&gt;But this sub seems to freak out if anyone suggests non-monogamy as a relationship model.

That's because for most it's a toxic model where one person generally wants to fuck other people and one is left to deal with the insecurity.  The Stars rarely align where both partners are truly interested in non-monogamy. 

Take the fact that you even thought to suggest it in the context of this post. One person wants to bail, the other wants to reconnect.  Your suggestion for an open relationship is so strangely misplaced when these two can't even connect with each other, let alone bring another sexual partner into the fold. "

996,"I can relate to this as a US citizen. I'm a single mom of 3 that is on food stamps and state insurance. My entire family are die hard republicans who despise ""entitlement programs"". As a single mom I am struggling as it is. I would barely survive without these programs. It's difficult to hear your loved ones dismiss issues that help make your life or you children's lives up to the status quo. It has certainly strained my relationships with them. When your life feels devalued by ones you love it is not easy to look at them the same way you once did. "
997,"Shit it's 10 days from her wedding/ his birthday. And the only reason she remembered is because her husband had it in a calander he happened to look at. If he didn't look I wonder how long it would have gone for. Personally if I was this kid, I wouldn't have said anything at all, but I would be stewing in rage and hurt that week"
998,The lying was ridiculous so do whatever you feel like but there will be ripples in your friend groups. Don't make them choose because people rarely choose the person who makes them choose. If you want to keep your friendships then you will need to find a middle ground. You can avoid talking to the couple rather then boycotting entire events or asking people not to invite them. Keep your head high and pretend they're not there.
999,"She called you a brat, she didn't actively try to kill you.

Yes, you are in the wrong here. This isn't very becoming of someone who calls himself a man. "
1000,"I've talked with him about it, but not as thoroughly as I probably should. Tho I'm also not sure if it'd be worth it to try and have a thorough conversation just yet, as he's (rightfully) more focused on figuring out what to do about the kids. Will definitely do so before actually leaving tho."

1002,"Considering all the refund and compensation this sub would have to hand out, I think it's best to keep it like this."
1003,"&gt; I just have a hard time understanding why she can't just do it for the sake of keeping me happy

Because that is despicable. She isn't there for sex whenever you want it. She has her own needs. She can't just make herself want sex when she doesn't. She is not obligated to sleep with you just because you want to get your dick wet. Seriously. I get you have needs. But being selfish enough that you would rather her just do it to make you happy than actually want it is just....ugh.

If you can't respect that, you need to find a different girlfriend. And you need to learn to respecting people's differences and their differing needs. Preferably before getting a new girlfriend. "
1004,"At first I thought it was a little strange you'd leave it up, but all of the points you make are completely valid. It will be weirder when you start dating someone else and they find out it's your ex in your profile picture. I can definitely see ""my new boyfriend still has a picture with his ex as his profile picture, should I be worried?"" on r/relationships. "
1005,"I just find it odd that there's more than a couple million people in the world and you choose the man 20 years older, who knew you when you were 5 and who has beef with your dad."
1006,"No, you shouldn't give him one last chance. It is abundantly clear that his relationship with his co-worker is more important than his relationship with you. Instead of cutting contact or changing his interactions with his coworker, he blamed you for being ""stubborn."" And it took him TWO WEEKS to miss you!

The coworker probably started dating someone else or shot your husband down after he asked her out (in those first two weeks). Or maybe he didn't really believe that you'd leave. Either way, you have him a choice- he chose her. When you were suffering, he didn't care. I don't know about you, but I would never be able to trust someone like that again. Proceed with the divorce- there's nothing to fix here."
1007,"Although I'm childfree by choice myself, as is my SO, I could understand why the unexpectedness of the miscarriage might arouse emotions your boyfriend didn't know he had. Still, if it's effecting your life in such a profound way, that's fairly serious. I'd probably have a frank talk with him about his feelings over this to determine if he's possibly a closet fencesitter. I hate the old ""you'll change your mind"" argument that CF people hear a lot, but his behavior seems off for someone CF. The grief seems excessive. Relief is what I'd expect from my own partner in this case (it's what I felt when I had an unexpected miscarriage, after being super-careful). It's weird. I'd root out the crux of it, and see if something with him has changed. "
1008,"Add to that ""aggressively pursued a relationship with a minor"" (although they didn't actually get together until after her 18th birthday)."
1009,"I don't get how the hotel didn't get into contact with you (card holder on the reservation) before making that extra charge.  Even if she told the hotel that you ok-ed it, I can't see why they wouldn't want to check in with you verbally anyway just to cover their bases.  I know very little about stolen credit cards and such, but if the hotel did charge you the extra money, wouldn't you be able to report it as fraud?  You only ok-ed a specific amount but were charged more based on the changes she made to the reservations."

1012,Does he *really* want to have children? Because it sounds to me like he may not and is just waiting you out.
1013,"Maybe think of it this way: By reporting her, she's going to have a much higher chance of getting the help she clearly needs."
1014,"Yeah.  Let alone when OP tells her 'you're not allowed to hit me', she rationalizes it by bringing up a past fight.  That's shifting blame.  I don't tolerate that in a partner.

When I tell my girlfriend something she isn't allowed to do, usually some lash she'll give me when she's moody, she apologizes immediately afterward, and agrees."
1015,"She should be sad.  This is a perfect learning example, because she's sooooo completely and inexcusably wrong.  Of course she should be on a need-to-know basis only about private information.

1016,"All I know is that every time a foreigner makes a post that says ""sorry about my English"" they then go on to make a perfect post with perfect formatting, I'm always a bit embarrassed at my lack of linguistic skills.

1019,"Because someone finally was willing to stand up and say that they are not comfortable around a guy who makes rape jokes, perhaps?

1024,"So what you're saying is that her argument has moral superiority and therefore has precedence?

Lots of people I know who chose a vegetarian lifestyle did exactly what youi're saying, pushing it on other people simply to be annoying or controlling. People can be shits and vegetarians too. Choosing a moral stance doesn't make you moral in every part of your life."
1025,"I have to agree with the other commenters here. I think it's a little immature of you to refuse to be in a wedding party because it's ""not your thing"" and its very extreme to outright refuse to go to the wedding just because you didn't like your sisters reaction. 

This is a huge moment in your sisters life. Put aside your differences and be there for your sister. "
1026,"&gt;  I realize that whole situation was on me, and it was my fault.

Then you realize wrong: when you were 14 you got coerced into sex - raped - by a 23yo predator. The whole situation is on *her*, and it was *her* fault.

At your age, girlfriends come (sorry) and girlfriends go, and eventually you'll find one one who's understanding of your situation - especially if you can trust her enough to share some of the context with her. If you're really happy that way, that should be enough.

But does it have to be that way all your life? You were victimized by a predator, and that's pretty traumatic. That would leave a mark on most people. It's not inconceivable that that's why you can't orgasm.

I hope you'll consider seeing a therapist. Not because there's anything wrong with you - you've obviously dealt with what happened in a strong way - but because there's a good chance that dealing with your past rape can make your life *even better*.

&gt; she was trying to make me finish, but I made sure I didn't. I guess I felt like that was my little ""win""

Yeah, but if you allow this to define your sex life, then that becomes her little ""win"", doesn't it?

You were victimized by a predator. It sounds like you've overcome that well. So why not see if you can heal the rest of the way?

The way I see it, you've got a whole lot to gain from talking to a counselor, and nothing at all to lose."
1027,I'm guessing op's bf was smart enough to go through and delete any really objectionable comments and in the future he'll keep whatever name he takes out of her sight.
1028,"So even factoring in an additional €5 for the bulk produce you get with your dad, your bf is adding an extra €10 to €20/week to your grocery bill and he has the gall to be offended when you ask him to replace things or help chip in.

That's like an extra €520 to €1040 a year! That's like an increase of 50% to 100% of your grocery bill! 

Does he have no shame? Why is he trying to make you feel bad? "
1029,Perfect time to dodge bullets!
1030,"You are not going to get a YouTube/Twitter/Instagram celebrity to have a ""wait a second, my family and friends aren't just props to get me more attention and money!"" epiphany, because they are too self-absorbed to ever have that level of awareness. 

Maybe you can negotiate some sort of camera-free zone for you to chill in with the other folks who don't feel like putting themselves out there."
1031,"I hoping things go well, but I'm skeptical. Hoping I'm proven wrong, but...

In March, they weren't close enough for him to invite her as a date to a wedding.  She gives a lot of mixed signals, the ""not a relationship type"" but telling her mom they'll be married (again- three months ago she wasn't close enough to be a wedding date.  Now she's telling her mom he's the future husband).  

Now, all hope is being hung on a hint of a promise, to occur in four months - when again three months ago he couldn't even ask her as a wedding date.  This is totally barring all their experiences that may come along in those four month and precludes OP basically saving himself for her while she can do whatever for four months until she leaves.

I hope for the fairy tale ending. But I'm a cynic, I guess.

Best of luck OP.  I started long distance relationship after only six weeks with a woman and we made it, so I know things can work out at times.  Just guard your heart here."
1032,Thank you.

1034,"End the relationship, I am sorry."
1035,You're right. 
1036,"Seriously. My mom grew up with abusive parents: a religious fanatic mom with a violent streak and a deadbeat drunk dad that spent every dime on booze. And she has never abused me or my brother.

1039,"I think I'd have to agree with your girlfriend here. If she made an attempt to get to know these particular two women and came home and told you that she felt they treated her inadequately and made her uncomfortable I would have taken her somewhat seriously. Instead you dismissed her concerns and defended your girlfriends. 


This thing about the other girls treating her differently is probably true. She's not saying she's jealous of these women she's saying she made an effort to get to know these women and they weren't kind to her. Even at the end you said your friends admitted to Never liking your girlfriend Bc she takes time away from them. 



In my opinion your female friends are the problem and I think that's something you need to understand. Also I see that your girlfriend didn't care that YOU hang out with them just that she doesn't want to be there which seems fair. She's not telling you not to hang out with them at all. She's also fair in saying when you two hang out she doesn't want them there. It seems like despite your two friends not so nice behavior towards her that she doesn't care if you have friends with them. 


Also she's kind of right, didn't Jordan come with Nali? Why did she leave her friend wasted at a party? Why did you have to be the knight in shining armor?"
1040,"Wow, you invited other people to a girls birthday party. People she deliberately didn't invite and turned her low key birthday in a puke fest. 

You ignored your gf all night in favour of these loud party girls so much so that she, the birthday girl and their friend group left the party area (the bday girls own apartment) and you didn't notice.

Then as a topper you want your gf to look after one of these drunk party girls while she pukes so you can... what? Continue to party with the other one?

Damn, dude.

All this and you still think your gf should be better friends with these girls. Frankly I'm wondering why she's friends with you.

edit: Oh, yes this is an advice sub, so I advise you to chose. Pick which girl(s) you would rather hang out with.  Pick one or two."
1041,"So... something bad happens and he wishes death on a female stranger? Uh, dude, bail.

1046,"So...if you had a baby girl, it wouldn't be gay, but it would be child molestation for him to change her diaper?

1047,The dog you have doesn't like other dogs. You know what that means? Don't get another fucking dog
1048,"Sorry, but I'm too curious not to ask... over the course of your relationship did you do anything sexual at all?"
1049,"I do take nude photos of myself for myself, but that is completely not the problem here.

""since I registered her that mail, I logged in and checked for the photos - it wasn't there, nor in the ""archived"" or ""deleted"" folder. Also, the last ""sent"" item was from long time ago.""

THAT is the problem, along with your rampant insecurity. You are a creepy creeper that goes way deeper than just ""innocently"" looking through her photos. This is about trust and you don't trust her and once she finds out how you found out about these photos she will be right to not trust you as well. If she is not hiding her phone or is in any way acting suspicious, then odds are there is nothing suspicious about the photos.

1050,I did last time but he was gone. My ex is a cop and he's been helping me with everything. 
1051,"&gt; I don't want to be too cynical, but /r/relationships brings it out in you.... seen that one play out too many times on here. And OP did mention she's getting a ""back in the kitchen"" vibe.

Seriously. Every time I mentally make fun of a reply, it ends up being right or right to the power of how wrong I was. 

"
1052,"Everyone is allowed to decide for themselves how and when they feel as though they are carrying a child. I agree with you, to a certain extent. There are people out there who choose to withhold that emotional bond, knowing things could turn south. 

**But it is not up to you**. I am sorry you lost two before eight weeks, that's awful. But your personal views don't change OP's sisters feelings, and they don't dictate to her as to how to feel, and they don't matter, since you're not OP's sister. 

You are not her. If she chooses to direct her family members to feel that way, that's fine. She can set the tone, for certain. But as you are not her and her pregnancy was not yours, you don't get to say how she feels. And until she's stated, clearly and with no compunction, that she considers this a NBD kind of thing, you have to walk in assuming she feels like she's lost a baby. That's the only humane way of approaching this. Unless informed otherwise, you should treat it like a loss of a life. "

I mean there is nothing that would ensure she'd even return your belongings in good shape- you might get a box of ashes or ripped up clothes.  

Seeing she's emotionally irrational, I'd be tempted to say ""fine, just keep it"" and move on.   

Cut off all contact, don't go to her home, do not stay over, do not do anything more with the woman.  It's worth your sanity to eat a loss of stuff you don't need."

1057,"I saw the thread and came in here to back you up. 

But now I’m not going to. 

Your sisters eyes are not ‘a bit’ worse. Your sister’s eyes are *a lot* worse. She is legally blind. Your vision loss is a bit inconvenient. 

I have a -12 script so not as bad as your sisters. I can’t drive and can’t get glasses strong enough to give me clear vision and the glasses I do have are heavy because of the thick lenses and hurt because I start getting headaches by the end of the day because of the weight and the general squinting to make things crisp. I often have to take them off halfway through the day and just put my head down on a desk and close my eyes for 15 minutes to give myself a rest from wearing them and give my eyes a rest. 

Contacts are usually not an option at this level of vision lost because they have to be so thick and it irritates the eye and at -18, her eye is shaped funny which makes it harder to get a contact to stay in place there. Trust me, we tried with me and had to give up and my eyes are not as bad as hers. 

Meanwhile, you can presumably drive, your glasses presumably correct your vision just fine and aren’t super heavy. You can get contacts, you’re just choosing not to. 

It is not the same situation. 

Let your parents do a nice thing and fix the vision of your legally blind sibling and spend a few days getting used to putting contacts in/out if you hate glasses THAT much. 

Or save up and get Lasik, because you can get Lasik and it’s cheaper. That cheaper option is not available to your sister. 

But your sister likely really needs this surgery. It's not cosmetic for her. "
1058,"When I was pregnant my husband's dog (we actually got her together but for my husband since I already had a dog) stuck to me like glue. Before I was pregnant she was all about my husband. She can be a very hyper dog but she was always so calm around me like she knew she had to be gentle. Now her and my toddler are like two peas in a pod. 

Also a tip, which I'm sure you've already thought about, make sure once baby arrives you still give the dog plenty of affection. When our daughter was sleeping I would sometimes put her in her swing and just sit on the floor with the dogs and spend time with them. Oh, and after our daughter was born my husband brought home a blanket she used for a few hours and let the dogs sniff it and get used to her scent. "
1059,"Did he justify his actions at all? Or just like ""yep, I'm selfish"""

Dude, no. You drive this route everyday, get the fuck over it. Grow up or move if you can't handle traffic like an adult.

Also telling: OP knew she should probably stay away from him because she knew he'd be pissed even before she saw this blow up."
