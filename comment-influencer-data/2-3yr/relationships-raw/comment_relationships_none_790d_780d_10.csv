0,"I always spilt the bill or take turns paying with my boyfriend (now husband). Dump her and start cooking at home. You will rack up a lot of credit card debit if you have to pay for every meal. 

She is being a spoiled brat. She wants to be fed for free, and receive constant gifts. And in return, you get... nothing. "
1,"I was just like you as a teenager. I also wasn't ready for sex and my then boyfriend would keep trying to force himself on me. Then he would get mad at me for being upset and saying no. I kept blaming myself. Maybe I was sending signals I didn't mean to send? Maybe I should just have sex already in order to appease him? 

Things continued to escalate each time we saw each other. The last time I saw him I had to kick him as hard as I could to get him away from me and I screamed at the top of my lungs and ran out the front door half dressed.

Be smarter than teenage me. Nip this thing in the bud before it escalates any further."
2,"You are in a physically abusive relationship with someone who abuses illegal drugs. 

This ends when one of you are dead. I am not exaggerating, I am not trying to scare you- this man will kill you, if he doesn't kill himself first.

Run as far away as you possibly can.  "
3,"I'm getting the impression that he was asking about your availability on Saturday not to see if you were free, but to make sure you were busy. 

Plus, roses? Fucking *roses*? That's just the cherry on this shit sundae. 

I wouldn't be able to forgive this. You shouldn't either. "
4,"He should, if she doesn't get help."
5,This is absolutely not okay. I have an aggressive male and encouragement of that aggression will only result in confusion when told no and excessive reactions to other people. This is not a good situation for the cat or you. A lot of vets also have behavioralists that they can refer you to. Ours was a life saver. Please look into a feline behavioralist and go from there. 
6,"You can go to r/legaladvice to try to find out tenants' rights in your area, and figure out if you have some legal rights based on how long you've been living there.

But more to the point, a relationship where your boyfriend *frequently* threatens to call the police on you or make you homeless is not healthy for you. Please leave him and find a different place to live."
7,"I'd give the girl the benefit of the doubt. Most people are misguided and not crazy. If she tries to spin it that way then you can report her or get another upper management supervisor involved.
"
8,How do two people this insane actually exist?  Please at least stay away from each other.  
9,"Am I understanding right, adding up your timelines, that this has been *less than 6 months*? 

You... dodged a bullet here.

And no, the only unconditional love that exists is between parent and child.  Love between SOs is *full* of conditions."

11,"You are totally right to be upset. No amount of drinking would give him permission to grope you repeatedly. Lots of men get blackout drunk and manage to not grope anyone. Tell him, and any mutual friend who asks, that you are choosing to not be around him because he *repeatedly groped you* at the party. This was despite his knowing you have a boyfriend and, more importantly, despite the fact that you clearly didn't like it, to the point that at the end of the night you were visibly crying. You are right to stay away from him, and you should let everyone know why."
12,"It's a precarious kind of situation. I don't think too many people would really fault you for wanting to cut it off. He's not exactly doing anything to assuage your concerns (and has outright lied to you on more than one occasion), and it's pretty apparent that he just enables this behavior in her rather than set reasonable boundaries for a friend/business partner.

If you want to make it work, it should depend heavily on his transparency and actually enforcing healthy boundaries with this girl. Otherwise they're going to stick with being ""not together together"" with his next girlfriend too."

14,"&gt;Should I get the test or end the relationship?


Yes. 

 "
15,"You and your BF are legit saying you'd rather this cat be at risk of dying early (and a likely painful death at that) than find it a safe, happy home. What is wrong with you? Contact the shelter, see what options they provide you. "
16,"I think your brother is right.  It sounds to me like your sister has some issues.  She hasn't been close to you, isn't getting along with her husband, didn't get to spend time with Brian - the common denominator is HER.  She's not a princess that the rest of you should be waiting on.  If she wanted to get along better with your brother, or you, she could have started by not putting you down when you tried to talk to her.  Frankly, she sounds like she's jealous of you.

She's nuts if she thinks you should be getting involved in her marital disputes."
17,"There will be many other women in bikinis on the beach, what is she going to do about them?

Just wear what you have, you'd be enabling her if you decide othwrwise."

19,Who says you're locked in? Elope tomorrow if you want. Or do a small byob do in a backyard.
20,"I have to work and I was never invited.

As far as why it wasn't cancelled: good question."
21,"Nah, if he cared he would just set an alarm or make a note or something to remind himself to do it. And he would actually do it. Chopping a head of broccoli takes what, like five minutes tops, and probably two utensils? 

To me, it sounds like he's chronically unmotivated and very used to having someone around to clean up his messes and take care of him. If he is fine with living in filth and not keeping up with things like dishes and laundry and maintenance and cooking and whatever, then it seems like that might just be his personality and you might have to decide whether you want to put up with that or not. It's pretty hard to change the personality of a grown adult (which I seriously have trouble calling him) but if he cares about you and wants your relationship to continue there is no reason why he can't step up and just do simple chores. This is a basic expectation for every single adult human being. I think you really need to lay that on the table for him and make damn sure he knows this is a relationship-ending issue. "
22,&gt; And when she brought up feeling used he **called her a prostitute and** rolled over and went to sleep.
23,"I have left him alone. I never tried to contact him at all, or ever asked for us to get back together. I love him a lot, yes, but I never tried to get him to get back together with me. I just want to understand what's going on.

The 5 extra sessions were my therapist's idea, not mine. I told her that I don't like asking for money, and that my ex has been constantly shoving money at me since we got together. Like when I refused his money he would get upset because he says that I clearly needed his help and I should just accept the help that's available to me. 

Even with the therapy, I told him I can take care of myself and I'll find a way to get it somehow, and he said that the way is already there, with him paying for it.

As for the support system, the truth is that *I* was the support system. He would often have mental breakdowns and panic attacks and I had to hold him and talk him through them so many times. Often he would also lash out at me and say mean things (Like my friends are ugly, or my ideas are stupid, etc). Later he would apologize and I never fought him for them because I know it's his disorder talking. If anything, *I* should have been the one to break it off. But when he wasn't in a bad mental state, he was REALLY good to me.

 Then suddenly everything went smooth and the meanness and mental breakdowns stopped, we were perfectly happy for a while (or so I thought). He said that he was sorry for how he treated me, and things will be okay from now on and he will take care of me. 

Then he breaks up with me out of the blue."
24,"Kind of an awkward question, but- were you actually joking?

Because most of the replies seem to be assuming that, but your comments are close to ""i was joking^(but not really icecream is really good) "". in which case playing it off like a joke is going to backfire.

I think you're going to get wildly different answers from people here based on whether you portray it as a joke or not.

&gt;I mean, I personally do prefer ice cream to sex. But I did tell him that it was a joke and I did apologize, but it hasn't made much of a difference.

Honestly, you're not doing yourself any favors then. It was already humiliating, but you're making it 10x worse by lying, especially if he realizes you're lying. Lying (especially if he can tell, and odds are he can) is literally the worst thing you could do.

Some people think sex is cool, but whatever. Some place a lot of value in it. This is *not* the way you want someone to find out you're the former, if he's the latter.

It's a legitimate sensitive issue even when discussed rationally. Most people don't want to be with someone who thinks they're just ""ok"".

"
25,"That $25,000 was also her DAD'S money that he had decided was for his daughter, on top of everything else.
  
You're being ridiculous. She borrowed money from a 13 year old and never planned to give it back. And stole money that was her father's from it's intended use.
  
You might not like that they clearly have enough money to both support her and give her $25,000 but that's how it is and the fact is, she took it and hasn't paid it back, breaking a promise to her daughter and ex husband."
26,Ouch. Understood.
27,"After reading your edit, your boyfriend's behavior was understandable. He could have been more considerate of your feelings. Having not grown up like you did, he probably does not understand that getting up and leaving would have felt impossible for you.

You should talk to him about your feelings. But you should also accept that other people are not obliged to put up with your dad's bullshit. You might decide that you are willing to put up with it in small doses, but don't subject your boyfriend to it."
28,Whether you want him to or not isn't up to you. Leave their relationship alone.
29,"I usually don't like when people say this. But...Do what you will but I would definitely dump him without a doubt. 

Why is he going on a trip with a bunch of girls?

Why is so unsympathetic to you being excluded? 

He essentially feels like he's losing time by coming home to you? 
"
30,"Although not very likely after three years.

Then again, OP didn't post where he lives. But if he's in the US I doubt any alimony will be awarded."
31,You pretty much said exactly what I was thinking.
32,"Just as a reference, I would rather chew my own right arm off than organize every weekend around a big extended family get together. This is definitely not everybody's normal. Does nobody in this situation work? When exactly do the nuclear families spend time alone together? Do they ever manage to work in the paternal grandparents? Do the kids ever get a full day with just mom and dad? Who the hell has the time and energy to pack the kids up for a big outing once a week and then attempt to settle them back down into a routine by Monday? What kind of a rude jerk tries to strong arm someone into agreeing to this?

It's exhausting to me just thinking about it. I imagine it's even more exhausting for your SIL having to justify herself to a pair of entitled family members who seem to think they are owed a significant portion of her time with her kids."
33,You don't need to do anything here. The vacation is over. Just don't go on another one with her. 
34,"&gt; Maybe he's struggling with seeing you more as a maternal being than sex goddess right now.

These aren't mutually exclusive. I get the discomfort but we shouldn't encourage it. There's an enormous tendency for men to view their wives as ""wives"" only until they become ""mothers"", and then suddenly they lose sexual attraction because it's impossible (in their minds) for women to be more than one archetype simultaneously.

At any rate he needs to talk to her about it. Even if he's ""not really sure how to sort out his feelings himself,"" that in itself is a valid contribution to open communication. But if he doesn't say anything, and continues to deny that there is anything wrong, it's going to continue to stress the relationship."
35,The hair is screaming 2006 to me.
36,"I agree with this, for sure. I'd also think very hard about possibly telling your dad that this dude was trying to force you (a minor) to do things like this. While having to turn in someone as young as 19 would be very bad for that guy, you don't want him going around trying to have sex with other kids your age. "
37,[removed]
38,"I would highly recommend you do not do this. She had a panic attack about meeting you... why would her reaction to your invitation be anything other that overly dramatic??

"
39,"Two things from her!  One, her laptop, which ended up hurting her physically.  And then when she was hurt, he decided to break her xbox too.

And she provoked this all by *smiling*.  

Yeah I'm not surprised that the police aren't buying the ""accident"" line.  It's pretty open and shut abuse."
40,"Not to mention (in the U.S.) you yourself could be charged with distributing child pornography (of yourself, as a 14 year old) by sending a nude picture to someone (even someone your own age, but certainly a lot of 19 year old). This is sort of politically fucked up because you arls a minor can't legally consent and would by most measures be a victim in such a scenario, this HAS happened a few times already (in the news). "
41,"I had a pretty cluttered car but a neat apartment. I just kept forgetting to clean my car until I was actually in it and on my way somewhere. I have a crappy memory like that.

That being said, I never left food or anything like that in my car. It was all stuff like receipts, clothing (like if I took off a hat and left it in the car), paperwork, etc. Never food. That's freaking nasty. If he's really an amazing person, maybe wait to see his apartment (I guess it's possible he just doesn't give a shit about his car) but I'm willing to bet his place is just as gross as his car."
42,"Uhm, in defense of OP here, it is an *insanely* unrealistic expectation to think that a partner of a few months is going to be just as emotionally connected/close to you as a friend you have had for over half of your life. 

*Anyone* of a few months isn't going to compare to a long standing, close friendship. If this was a long term partnership and/or marriage, yes, the partner should come first- but she's already made it clear that she isn't even sure if she loves him yet. It's a new relationship. 

Emotional connections and closeness develop over time- not because someone gets the title of boyfriend/girlfriend. You have to *know* someone for it. Her boyfriend and her are still in the ""Who are you"" stage. 

&gt;How can he get emotionally close to you if you are emotionally close with some one one else?

This is also an insane expectation. A partner should not be the only person you are emotionally close to. That is literally what friends are for. A long term partner, spouse, ect, should be first on the list. A partner of 8 months should be *building their way* onto the list. "
43,"I may be wrong, but I get the feeling that the uber driver said nothing, and your girlfriend made this up to ""back up"" her feelings, and almost shame you into doing things her way. 

She isn't a child, let alone your child, and should be able to figure out a way home herself without causing you such stress. It seems very high maintenance and immature for her to expect so much from you when she is aware of what you're already doing for your Father. 

It sounds extreme, but I'd give her an ultimatum. Either she is supportive of you and manages to find her way home herself, or it's over. I cringed even typing that.. ""manages to find her own way home"" .. as if that's such a huge ask of an adult."
44,"You're assuming he's not telling her beforehand, then you're getting riled up off that assumption, lol. I doubt the OP would be on here if it was a lack of communication over the course of several dates. If he ever didn't tell her he planned on splitting checks I'm sure it only happened once. 

I like to pay for dates myself. But eventually as the relationship progresses I'd expect my SO to at least offer to pay. If they don't from experience, they tend to be a handful and not in a good way. There's a reason why a majority of women offer to pay or Split the check. It's because they want to be equal contributors to the relationship and don't want to be perceived as a selfish princess. "
45,If you were in the United States I would say to call child protection services or whatever it's called. But since you're in an Asian country I'm not sure what kind of resources are available to you 
46,"I suppose that's a possibility. It isn't an intentional thing. I don't talk to my entire family as much as I should. The only ones I really keep in contact with is my stepbrother, who lives in the same city as me - we hang out every couple weeks, and my birth mother who essentially messages me every week so I respond to her. 

I suck at keeping in touch because...well I'm a shitty person I guess. But I try to keep them informed of big life changes. IDK."
47,"It's very thoughtful. It's not going to help her sister. People with irrational feelings and untrustworthy partners (?) are not helped by being indulged. 

It's like giving an addict in withdrawal a hit. It temporarily soothes but sets them back. 

He best bet is to be firm on this and not change her swimsuit while also offering an ear about her insecurities and telling her how helpful therapy was for herself. 

"
48,[removed]
49,"""Look, I have something I need to talk to you about. I will respect your decision whatever you decide to do with the information and I truly understand if you can't carry on with us anymore but know that this relationship with you means a lot to me and I would love to continue with us. Before we got together I had a fling with your sister, I didn't know it was your sister - she told me her name was Helen and it all ended in January and I've not been in contact with her since. Seeing her the other day was the first time I've seen her since then""

Stick to the facts, tell her how you feel about her but let her know you are willing to support her if she needs time away from you to think or anything else."
50,"Its fine to jerk off, but you dont have to do it every morning. And if you do you have to get up earlier. Hes fucking 12, not 8"
51,no but the existing cat will feel the difference. Most cats hate new cats arriving.
52,"I think it's because he has very little un-interrupted alone time. There are always people around him that need something, and that tires you out. I don't think it's specifically your child. He doesn't need to stop gaming, he needs to have alone time so he will need to game way less to be able to feel satisfied and de-stressed.  
  
Edit: Scrap that, from your other comments it's clear he's very addicted to gaming. He's nearly always unavailable. 30-50 minute games, 5 games a day, in the weekends twice that amount. And still it's not enough for him to be relaxed. He has no interests besides work, gaming and avoiding housework by pretending to be inept. (He's not, he works in a kitchen, he knows very well what needs to be done, otherwise his ass would be out of a job already.) He says he doesn't know what to do. He just doesn't know what to do to get you to shut up and do all the housework and keep the kid away from him, that's all.    
  
Please google video game addiction and see if you recognize the signs. 

&gt;A behavior is an addiction when:  
- The person needs more and more of a substance or behavior to keep him going.  
- If the person does not get more of the substance or behavior, he becomes irritable and miserable.  
 
If his real life stress is being 'solved' by a gaming addiction, he needs solutions for both, possibly professional help. "
53,"At this point we're just waiting for my body to recover from the surgery &amp; inflammation.  He's taken me off pelvic rest and said ""hopefully you get pregnant before but come back in 2 months and we'll start IUI then IVF"".

It took about 4 months for me to get scheduled surgery at a time when my husband could care for me after I was released.  Most of the delay has been on our end just because of schedules for the both of us."
54,You got promoted in February and she bailed in February. Is it possible that she was vying for that promotion and is resentful towards you because you got it instead?
55,"&gt; Diane then commented that she had wanted a dress from that designer but thought she couldn't get them in the US

Well, maybe she should have checked into it, then? This all seems really petty. I would just ignore her message and move on. I had a ""frenemy"" who would get really pissy with me whenever anything good happened to me (I struggled with weight and when I got fit, she made snide remarks about it constantly; she made snide remarks when I got a job I'd really wanted, when I started dating my now-husband, when I got engaged ... she could never be happy for me, ever). Life isn't a competition, and it's too short for that kind of crap."
56,The break was probably done *so* she could sleep with him. 
57,You hit the nail on the head. He never grieved or 'had closure' or whatever on his marriage. People really should wait to date after divorce. 
58,"Short answer: he's an asshole. He might be hurting, he might have mental health issues, he might be in trouble, but he's *choosing* to be an asshole, and there are just too many people in his life enabling those choices. 

You ever hear the joke about how many therapists it takes to change a light-bulb? Just one, *but the light bulb has to want to change!* 

As long as there is no consequence to him for crashing cars or binge drinking or neglecting his health or thinking of himself as unhappy, there's no reason for him to change any of that behavior. 

He might have mental health issues, but binge-drinking plus no exercise plus bad self-talk can look a lot like mental health problems at a distance. Likewise, being absent-minded, not taking care of his home cleanliness or his work tasks *might* be a mental health issue, but it might also just be a lack of routine and discipline. 

Until he *chooses* to try something different, and makes a real effort at it, there's no way to know if there are any medical issues. And because he's explicitly, repeatedly **chosen** not to address these things, that puts him in the asshole camp.

Now, the better question is what do **you**, OP, want do about it? Because it's very likely that you've crossed that hard-to-see line from ""supporting your partner"" to ""enabling your partner's bad choices"". "
59,"I wasn't aware cooking food and owning a dog a dog we're against my lease... Because they are not. We cooked pork that night, with windows open. I get that shoes aren't meant to be left outside, but each of my neighbors have personal belongings in the halls (wreaths, mats, etc) and it was a half an hour..."
60,[deleted]
61,"I don't know, it's unclear if she even knew that he had a gf. It's phrased like maybe she was checking if he had a plus one and he offered up the idea of uninviting gf of his own accord. "
62,"Well, you kind of already betrayed your sister by opening your mouth to your boyfriend about it. Too bad you won't say something to your BIL. I won't go as far as saying that you are as awful as your sister but you are close. I can see why your boyfriend is starting to have trust issues with you. "
63,"I'm very worried that you seem to have ignored virtually all the advice given, and the way you describe your current situation sounds like an immense amount of work on your end to end up several steps behind where you started, but I sincerely hope that this is indeed working out and we don't see you again."
64,"You're not compatible. 

But  you should note, describing your arguments as logical and hers as emotional is a huge fallacy. You're just as emotionally invested in your arguments as to why you don't want children, they're not magically logical because they come out of your head. "
65,"It means he's willing to cross lines that people in their right minds wouldn't cross. There is a concern, not a certainty, but she would be wise not to wait and see what he's capable of right now. "
66,"&gt;Babies are disgusting, children are annoying and teenagers are just scum of the earth.

I'd love to see how people would react if this was said about any other group of people. "
67,"When I met my husband he was really similar to your husband.

I'll give just one example: he used to lose bank cards ALL THE TIME , literally when he'd go into the bank and order another they'd make him pay for it because it was the twelfth one he'd lost that year. 

He used to carry his card around loose in his pocket, when I asked why he had no wallet he'd say ""if I had a wallet I'd lose that too"". It was INFURIATING, the time we'd waste while he looked for shit, or him realising he had no way to pay for something and calling me to come and bail him out. 

I basically just told him that I wanted to date a grown up, it sounds terrible but I just shamed him into changing. Told him he reminded me of a useless kid, and that I'm losing attraction because I don't see him as a man when he acts like that. 

I bought him a nice leather wallet, and he made an effort over time, he's a lot better. I think, like your partner, he just doesn't realise how unattractive these traits are.. people are sometimes encouraged to play up the ""oh I fail at adulting lol"" thing and really don't realise how infuriating that behaviour is if it persists.  It's not cute, and anyone can change if they make an effort. "
68,Sue him for 15 years of back child support. 
69,I don't think you understand how relationships work.
70,"Oh my god, you're so right. This is infuriating!!"
71,"Even in a Western context, I've been on dates with men who seemed obviously bothered by my expectation that we'd split the bill.  One guy even told me ""it's normal for the man to pay!"" 

There's also the fact that women typically earn less - *especially* in more patriarchal cultures. I mean, I don't think her specific finances are particularly relevant here, but that's part of what feeds into the ""man pays"" cultural expectation. "
72,I had the same thought fwiw: she's his girlfriend not his mother. He just seems like an ass honestly.
73,"Yeah, OP literally gave her ex textbook reasons for breaking up and described a future she wanted that literally describes being single... but then called it a 'break'. I'm not trying to be cruel by rubbing salt in the wounds or anything, but I really just can't understand how anybody could rationalise this as anything other than a break up."
74,"&gt;She's quite entitled to voice her concerns but she's not entitled to flat out tell me I can't do something.

I completely agree! But she is entitled to decide she doesn't want to be with you anymore if you ignore her concerns, right? "
75,That's the saddest thing I've read in a long time.
76,or you could find someone who wants and desires the same level of sexual intimacy that you are able to provide. Note for some people it also takes a lot more than three months to feel totally comfortable. 3 months isn't very long at all. 
77,"Life and love are definitely not black and white, but that is not some kind of get out of jail free card. Everyone has excuses for their actions and people rarely see themselves as the bad guy.  If this was the 50's I would be more inclined to not be as harsh, but gay pride was going strong 8 years ago too. Cheaters, for the most part, are extending a relationship past its expiration date. Most of those relationships were started with good intentions and true feelings. OP's relationship was under false pretenses from day 1. This isn't something that changed over time or a bunch of small decisions led him down the wrong path. I can't see any way to justify what he did, and therfore I have no sympathy for it."
78,This is exactly how I feel
79,Just because she has expensive tastes doesn't mean that it's your problem. Get her whatever's within your budget. 
80,"I really like the language you used here. My SO is extremely organized and dependable, except for when it comes to traveling. It's been bothering me for a long time, but he finally got it when I framed it not as a right or wrong way to do things, but as something that was making me anxious and upset. OP's boyfriend may be fine operating this way on his own, but when it's something that affects OP, he should care about whether the process upsets her, not just the outcome of whether it worked out in the end."
81,He did. His coping mechanism is to find a mommy bang-maid that takes care of everything for him.
82,"You need to decide something. Looking at these texts you can clearly see that this was initiated on her end. He seems kinda reluctant and like he doesn't really want it to happen, **but your wife is pushing him to make it happen**.

Also the line ""i don't have to come in cray. I know what you drive""

Do you really believe that they were not physical? Sounds like they have done it in his car. With how heavily she was ""dying to see him"" and similar lines, I seriously sincerely doubt that this was not a physical thing.

She cheated on you. She will cheat on you again if the opportunity arrises. Just think if her boss has a lapse in judgement one day and ""calls her into his office"". Do you think she would stay faithful?"
83,"I'm not really sure. I guess a wife who is heterosexual, which obviously isn't true in my case but even if it was I don't really get why that'd be a bad thing. I've never heard the term before."
84,[removed]
85,"This. Exactly. The fact is that the stories we tell about why we did things changes from situation to situation (i.e. who we are telling, and why). I'm not saying that she didn't do something awful, but the reality is likely somewhere beyond knowing at this point. As children--even as we become adults, our parents' relationship is practically inscrutable. I mean, we aren't even always very clear on our *own* relationships, are we? Just recognize that we are all capable of being awful and wonderful. Her behavior probably sucked, but maybe so did your dad's? Don't evaluate living with a parent based on what they did with someone else, but rather how they treat you and how your living situation is, when it comes to mental and physical health and comfort. "
86,[deleted]
87,"I'm sorry this is horrifying. I don't think I have anything useful to add. She sounds terribly selfish and awful from what you described here but she's your wife and I'm sure you love her for a reason.

I hope this turns out the best it possibly can. You sound like a really kind and devoted person with what you are willing to do for others. You deserve better. "

92,"It's easier for her if Steve just comes but she does not want him there. I mean, she likes Steve to a certain extent, she's very used to him now anyways. It wouldn't bother her to have him there as much as it would bother me. She's totally fine with me uninviting Steve, she hasn't put up a fight about it. She knows Steve pushes boundaries and is an idiot. She was just dreading him being uninvited and whining to her for weeks about it. "
93,"Is he going on vacation for 3 weeks or is he going home to his wife in Paris???

You've already admitted that he lies to you every time you are together...."
94,"I think you're right. To me, it seems like she isn't actually upset about him using a vulgar example as much as she is offended by the comparison. It's not flattering to think of it as a compulsion, but it *is* one."
95,"Look man, it's going to be hard to accept, but your wife is being extremely selfish - to a point where I'd legitimately question her ""love"" for you.  She doesn't seem to be worried about your feelings and/or well-being, so it's time that you started tooling out for yourself. "
96,"I mean, he shoves people for cutting in line. I'd be shocked if that was the only disproportionately violent response to everyday life."
97,"Imagine what sort of memories you two are going to share on a *dream vacation*.  Imagine your girlfriend imagining that while she's stuck at work.  Imagine her having to deal with you two talking about all the amazing memories you've shared together, once you return.  Her boyfriend and one of her best female friends.  Imagine her trying to come to terms with the fact that you and her best female friend now have this special connection, all while it was supposed to be her.

You really get to know a person on a month long trip to a *dream destination*.  You see the good and the bad.  You work through itinerary issues together and work as a team.    You bond emotionally big time.  You live through memories that you'll remember for the rest of your lives.

Try to see this from your girlfriend's point of view.  Just because there's no sex doesn't really matter here."
98,"What horrible, nasty people all around. Your SIL for cheating and lying and abandoning her son, your ex-BIL for kicking the child he raised for 16 years to the curb at the first opportunity, and your wife for jumping into this onslaught of toxic sludge headfirst without a second thought. Your poor, poor nephew.

I'd never be able to look at her the same way again. She prioritized her worthless sister over her innocent nephew and is doing her level best to drag your equally innocent daughter into this shitstorm of terribleness because she can't seem to face that the family ""he"" destroyed brought all of this on themselves. I think I'd be done with her. That's a fundamental character flaw that won't be easy to overlook. "
99,"I teach 10 and eleven year olds. I am not going to venture a guess on a medical problem, but girls that tall are not that rare. We have several girls each year who are that tall. Most of them have hit puberty (and ""growth spurt"") early and do not get any taller as they grow up."
100,"This is bad, your wife needs counselling fast. Her sister is the one tainted with evil here, no one else, especially the boy. he did not stuff himself into your SIL womb.

This problem needs professional help. Her irrationality is now having a negative impact on you, your kids and your household. 

So you have to indicate that she has some choices to make and some behaviours to re-consider in that in being a support for her loser of a sister, she is failing as a mother, a wife and an aunt. 

To me, it has to start with her understanding that this mess begins and ends with her sister. That is were the flaws and faults lie. If she can't do that I feel that she may permanently damage your household. Also, if your wife continues in this way, she will erode the respect and affection of her family.

Also , could you confirm that whether your post indicates that the SIL had only one affair or two. 

Congrats to you for being a concerned dad, husband and uncle.
"
101,"Holy crap. A midlife crisis may include a sports car purchase or the sudden urge to travel, but this is way overboard. Honestly I'm not sure what you should do. This is not normal and sounds really stressful. Your mom should start seriously making sure your dad's behavior is not going to ruin any kind of retirement she had planned. An intervention could be good. Point out all the things you've listed here, how different he is, how it's affecting everyone, and ask him whats wrong and what you could do to help. Don't be surprised if he just says ""fuck this"" and leaves or something though. At that point, further actions by all family members should be to protect themselves from his erratic behavior, whether that be financially, physically, or emotionally. Sorry you're all in this situation."
102,"What the fuck dude, who cares if people turn their backs on her? SHE PROBABLY WANTS TO KNOW IF SHE'S BEING CHEATED ON AND THAT HE CHEATED ON HER ON THEIR WEDDING DAY.

Give her some respect, dude, holy fuck. Who are you to determine what is best for her?"
103,"Yeah I agree with you, but remember that if she genuinely is in a funk, telling her the kid probably isn't autistic or that the kid being autistic "" isn't so bad"" would come off as invalidating. "
104,"Feel insulted, hurt, and ready to find someone new. This boyfriend is defective, please exchange for a better model. "
105,"I told him this when we talked about the hot water tank. I said I didn't want it to leak/explode/whatever and damage anything. When I said ""what about your [insert expensive personal item stored near the water heater] he shut up and had nothing to say. I agree that it's lazy. I told him he's lazy. Then he says how I have more time off (even though we both work 40 hr weeks) because my time off (AKA time between shifts) sometimes overlaps with day time hours, therefore *I* should make the phone calls, etc. I respond by saying he has lunch or days off too. He says mine are easier to manage. He's constantly trying to justify pushing all the responsibility onto me."
106,"She cheated, had sex with him, trickled the truth to you, and is fighting to avoid accountability. This is not the kind of person I would want to be stuck with for the rest of my life. You're incredibly young and you don't need this. Trust me. "
107,"Tough spot to be in for you, but I wonder how sure you are of what's going on? A second phone number and observation of your mother meeting up with another family member don't seem to be the clearest smoking guns to me. Like, was it a hotel where you saw them meet? Why would the 'affair number' be registered to a physical location so easily traceable/wouldn't it just be the billing address? 

I would probably dig deeper and have some solid evidence before speaking with your dad about it. 

"
108,"FFS, the sister's godawful BF *threatened* OP. OP has no reason to want this guy in the house, and every reason to think her sister won't change her behavior. The idea that OP should have somehow known the future (that the BF would escalate his shittiness) and planned accordingly is ridiculous. OP, don't listen to this person!"
109,"Check out the website Surviving Infidelity. Whether or not Ralph was involved this was cheating. I don't think there anyway to justify this. Messing around with your own spouses in the same room is a large distance away from getting sexual with anyone else without your spouses knowledge and consent. Talking about a fourway doesn't give her permission to have sex with them on her own. Even if Ralph wasn't involved this would be cheating. The lying and trickle truthing only makes it worse. How can you trust what she said about what happened?

Deal with your emotions now. It is possible for a relationship to come back from infidelity, but it takes work from both partners. The one who strayed has to admit fault and take steps to regain trust.

Right now you might let yourself calm down. Check out that website and the forums on it. Consider talking to an online counselor, or even a ""listening service"" like Seven Cups of Tea. Wait to make a decision and problem solve until you see your wife in person. You may need to bring this to couple's counseling."
110,"Lifelong friend or not, Janet is a child abuser. She physically and emotionally abuses a boy who has no support network, and she sees nothing wrong with that. Just think of it.


I am a stepmother myself, and your friend is a disgusting human being. "
111,"To be totally dependent is of course bad. 

But  the rest? *cue  music from The Jungle Book* ""THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR""

HE just doesn't want you coming to him with your problems. And he doesnt understand how friendship works. And he doesnt understand how SOCIETY works. Ever since we were monkeys we've gone to each other for support. Thats what society IS. Would he turn down social security? Does he have insurance or health insurance? Did his parents ever feed and clothe and house him? Then he is a hypocrite or an idiot."
112,"Its such a relief to hear that. I feel like I've been going crazy trying to accept his belief that I shouldn't expect him to be there for me, especially when he can be. I actually just tried talking to him again, but to no avail. He stuck by his claim that its controlling of me to have the expectation for him to be there for me and that I need to learn to take care of myself. He says its his choice whether he wants to be there for me or not, and I shouldn't be upset if he's not even if he can be. But I think I'm going to stand my ground on this one. I'm glad I was able to get some clarify from this post. Thank you so much! "
113,The point is that providing income is not enough. A child's parent should be involved in their life. Kids as young as Max don't see their house and clothes and food as expressions of love- they need parental involvement to feel loved. 
114,"I can understand you feeling inadequate if your boyfriend has landed so well... but please remember just because you feel inadequate, doesn't mean it's true!! 

TBH you ARE in a new place, starting all over again. And that's okay. In fact, you should be proud, you've come so far! You have years ahead of you to keep on moving forward and making progress... either in your career, or outside it!

"
115,They've literally only been talking for two weeks and been on one date. She's ending it tonight. It's not like she let it go on forever. You're acting as though she strung him on for months. As soon as she realized he was being clingy and weird she's ending it. 
116,"Change your meal time so you eat before him.

If he wants to eat, he's then either got to cook for himself/takeout/ask you to cook something.

If he asks, straight up tell him that you aren't cooking for him and that he is a grown man. If he protests, tell him to Google a recipe and follow the instructions that are broken down so that even a 3 year old can follow them.

If he continues to order takeout, you then re-adjust how you split bills for food so you aren't financially burdened by his lazy nutrition. Him deciding to order expensive food is not your financial burden, it is his.

If he cooks for himself, progress.

I'm willing to bet if he gets takeout repeatedly and is the one that financially covers it, that it won't be long before his wallet hurts and he'll learn to cook out of necessity.

And the entire time, you just stick to your guns. You've eaten. You're sick of catering to a basic skill that he refuses to learn.

All of these are completional rational and logical, so if he turns any of them into an inflated issue/argument, then you should really take consideration about giving him an ultimatum.

You should not be with somebody who is so unaware of your contributions and doesn't value them at all."
117,"I just doubt they fancy her. Seems more like they resent her. But yeah, either way, shitty people."
118,It is disrespectful. Someone said they don't want somethign and you give it to them you certainly aren't respecting their right to choose. 
119,"I had a similar situation happen with my younger sister. Views and personalities and all. I ended up going straight to the root of the problem. I've told her how our conversation was just wasted words, and how I intentionally avoided her because of the way she's carrying herself. I let it all out man, especially the dead inside feeling you get when you shut down,and how that manifests the moment she opens her mouth. Then, after I let it all out, I allowed her to express her distain towards me without interruption. With all of it out in the table, I asked her one simple question: 

 • Are you content with the outcome of our 20+ year feud?
• Do you want to work at being people to each other?

She chose to be people with me. And I use the term people because there is a basic level of courtesy you give a person regardless of their status in your life. From people, I'm hoping I can work on a friendship with my sister, and work on giving her time to try to connect with me where we can genuinely find some type of fruitful communication level. It's the small things like communication that ruin your relationship with your sister. Maybe coming back home will be the best first step of being people to each other. "
120,Depression can and does stop people from being able to do simple things like send a text. 
121,"Tell him. Write him a letter if you have to. Tell him all the things you wrote here about what you went through when you were young and how much you miss him. I would avoid criticism about his lifestyle. Just be straight up and tell him you miss your friend. It may not work, but at least you can move forward knowing you gave it one last try."
122,"...did you even read the post?

She's talked to him about this. Multiple times. He just doesn't ""get it"". "
123,"I feel like the big issue here is that it was microwaved.  A lot of recipes call for pre-cooked chicken, and it is ok to cook the chicken for it the day ahead.  That's not even really leftovers, just following a recipe.  

Just thinking now about microwaved leftover mashed potatoes and how those taste.  I love love love mashed potatoes, but leftovers microwaved are an abomination.  Fry them in a pan where they get a little browned and they're back to amazing, though.  And my one year old can definitely tell the difference between microwaved vegetables vs ones cooked on the stove.  It's not some special skill to notice that. "
124,"&gt;My ex does not even like her or her boyfriend, so there is clearly only one reason they are all hanging out and it's also made pretty clear by the posts. 

Er, what's the reason? If the ex doesn't like her or her boyfriend then why are they hanging out and why isn't she hanging out with you instead of this guy who doesn't even like her?"
125,"Thanks, that's a really good way to put it. Especially the ""I know you're kidding, but tell me you're kidding.""

She's not kidding... but maybe that would help her to see it as an awful joke. "
126,"yes! this is some ""Sliding Doors"" shit here"
127,Too soon to say you're not gonna get crazy yet.
128,"Great point that I suppose some people might not realize. Adderall (and similar medications) are controlled substances, and in the U.S., there is no way to get or fill a prescription earlier than your regular ""schedule,"" which is typically a 30-day cycle. 

It's stressful enough to try to make sure I keep track of that precise schedule (since I am often out of town for work, and many pharmacies treat these prescriptions like heroin, so it can actually be difficult to get a prescription filled at a different pharmacy where they don't know you. Ugh."
129,"You are waayyyy too young to be dealing with this girl. If you take her back, expect that she'll pull something similar again now that she knows she can twist your arm. Get out there and meet some other people! Who knows, maybe somewhere down the line she'll grow up and you two can get back together but tbh, you seem extremely more mature than she is and can do a lot better."
130,"I don't think you're crazy for wanting to meet her. If she's an ex and staying with your bf then he should allow you two to meet so there isn't any drama and to quell any uneasy feelings you might have about the situation. I wouldn't try and be with them every minute of the two days she's there, but I would be very honest with your bf and offer to take the 3 of you out for drinks or lunch or something like that just to meet her and speak with her. Show him that you trust him by letting them catch up as friends without you there but he should also show you that there's nothing to worry about by allowing you to meet her . "
131,"That's kind of how I feel, but he (husband) is super non-confrontational and uncomfortable saying these kinds of things. "
132,"Sure, that's a reasonable amount. 

What alone time without the baby do you spend with your wife? I'm sensing a disconnect developing and now is the best time to address that. A weekly date night without baby will be the best thing you do for your relationship."
133,"An absolutely ridiculous response. Dude just told you that the game changed... from being the most insane time sink in the world to being something you can play successfully 1 HOUR A WEEK.

Your response shows that you really just hate the game that much and are going to be unreasonable towards any sort of compromise."
134,"I take Adderall and Norco and I keep them locked and I've had to cut a friend out of my life because all he'd do is harass me for my meds. 

I have to lie to family members, especially my brother and father, about taking Norco because they ask for some every time I see them.  I've never shared a single pill. But it doesn't stop them from trying. 

My husband mentioned in passing to a couple co-workers that I take Adderall and someone from a different department heard about it and asked him for some. 

This shit is too real."
135,"If he would lose money on deposits, etc. by not going then I understand.  Otherwise, I think it's pretty thoughtless.  But I also think it's kind of strange that you've been together 4 years and don't feel comfortable talking about this openly....also you haven't talked to him in a couple days?  It sounds more like a casual relationship to me.

edit: read one of your comments and it sounds like YOU'RE going to lose some money from the deal?  You should include that in your OP.  That is way different and pretty fucked up."
136,"I don't know about you but I had 75 of my nearest and dearest there to witness our wedding. Pretty sure that it's still completely valid despite no child witnesses, lol. In case you can't tell I'm a little salty at your insistence that everyone must get married your way. I really hope you are a troll because I just can't get past the entitlement. Live your life, and let people live theirs. What is the purpose of insulting people who think differently than you."
137,Tell this guy to piss off. This type of garbage would make any girl's vagina slam shut. There are Plenty of men out there who would love to hang out and have yummy dinner and spend time with you. Go find one right after you fling the curry all over this fucker's face.
138,"You might just want to make a separate post. 

No one is going to address the issue of favoritism when it is buried in the comments and under all the babysitting, moving, sister etc concerns.

Ultimately, your sister isn't the problem. Your parents are. They are the ones deprioritizing you and your family and hurting you. "
139,"You don't think you do, but obviously you do"
140,"For what it's worth, I think very similarly to your girlfriend. I wouldn't say divorce is inevitable but I absolutely believe that divorce is *always* on the table. Because...it is. We live in an era where it's quite literally always an option. Pretending that it's not an option just makes you complacent. For me, acknowledging that divorce is always an option is motivation for me to make sure that divorce is the least preferable option. My husband could leave me--so, what are we going to do, day to day, to make the marriage worth staying in? "
141,"Poor table manners are gross to some people. Not everyone wants to hear people smack their lips, lick their plates, and chew like a fucking cow at the dinner table. "
142,"Everything ""good"" she did because she wanted something from you. She stopped acting that fake role once she learned she wasn't going to get it. Now you see her for who she really is once that act was dropped. You were friends with a fictional character, whom she is no longer interested in playing."
143,"&gt;Neither of you handled it well

He handled it perfectly. He just has to now follow through.
 
&gt;now you know that going forward, a break is a breakup. 

OP already knew this. "
144,"My first question would be timeline. Timeline, timeline, timeline. Go get an ultrasound done, then you can really have a better understanding of when this child was conceived. Secondly, find out if baby daddy #1 wants to be in this kids life. And OP, hate to say it, but you need to rule out the possibility of there being a baby daddy #3. Time for a serious conversation with this lady of yours"
145,"Point her toward food banks and food pantries in her area.

Sorry to be a skeptical Redditor... but have you guys met in person? This sounds a bit like a catfish scheme to get money."
146,Except that the grandma takes their child most afternoon/evenings and OP says he does most childcare and chores on the weekends.  It doesn't sound like there is a fair or equal division of labour.
147,Literally every person in the world except for a small hand full is selfish then.
148,[removed]
149,"Yes, you're being selfish. At some point, you're going to have to learn that situations like this are nobody's *fault*. Right around your age are when peoples' lives begin moving, and they don't always move parallel to those of their SO's. It sucks right now, but in the long run, it's for the better (for both of you). 

Your last paragraph just sucks, man. His career isn't about you, and it's completely unreasonable to make him feel like dirt for trying to pursue something good for him, simply because you feel ""tossed aside"" whatever that means. Stand on your own two legs. 

Here are the comments that I feel are especially immature: 

&gt;I told him I felt heartbroken and like he’s choosing his potential career over our relationship. 

&gt;I feel like I don’t matter and my career doesn’t matter.

&gt;I just feel so tossed aside.

&gt;my needs getting shoved aside because I don’t want it to end.

You're making a hell of a lot about you. What about his needs? His career? You need to start thinking about yourself, and how you're going to manage without him, because he's doing what's best for him, with or without your support, and I commend him for that. The opportunity to become a writer in Hollywood comes with an extremely short window, and he can't wait for you to decide what you want to do with your life. 

You need to work on yourself, and your life on your own, instead of casing blame on him, and making your happiness his responsibility. "
150,"The thing is - they were not ""snooping."" Also I edited my post because this is not a house. That was my mistake. It is a hotel and it's called The Lake House. It would make no sense (to me) that folks can't walk around a hotel at their leisure, especially when no one said it was off limits. "
151,They were not entering bedrooms. I don't know where you got that. I would consider that suspicious (who wouldn't?). I'm trying to appreciate your perspective but I just don't agree.
152,"Well obviously?

You're wanting to uproot your household and life to chase after your mom whilst also expecting your husband to be comfortable with something you're actively trying to avoid. Avoiding so much you're willing to make such a big change in your lives."
153,"&gt;From what you've shared, being a crossdresser for you is the same as me saying I'm 100% lesbian. 

sexual orientation is not a paraphilia"
154,"Long story short:
We went out to a group gathering and I upset him (a justifiable reason on his part) and he left me there. I was driving so he Ubered home.

This is where it got ugly: he came back about an hour-ish later and pulled me outside to ""talk"" about the issue. He didn't get the answer he wanted, so, he dumped my dog and bag of stuff on the sidewalk, telling me not to come back to his place. I drove back to my apartment later on.

The thing is....he came there with the intent of dumping my pet and stuff , not finding a resolution. Red Flag, breakup territory and I caved to his pleas not to dump him at the time; he seemed so genuinely  remorseful."
155,"Ok yeah if he cares this much about micromanaging the cooking then he needs to roll up his sleeves and cook for himself. Because he is micromanaging it. Like, he's way over the line of being reasonable. If it's important to him to discover every food intolerance that he may or may not have then he needs to step up and be an adult.

You can make him a basic salad or something so he doesn't starve to death but the rest is on him."
156,"""I'm sorry, but this doesn't sound like the kind of party I'd enjoy. Please have fun without me.""

Because seriously, don't go to a party that's supposed to be about you where you will be doing nothing you actually want to do."
157,"Throw her back, grab another fish, it's done. You'll be miserable and untrusting from here on out."
158,It's not that big of a deal. If she is going to dump you or cheat on you she is going to do it whether or not she lives with a guy. I lived with my brother and a male friend of ours when I was dating my boyfriend and he couldn't care less. 
159,Good question. Fucking hell. Have some self respect! 
160,"Yeah, plus I sort of keep seeing it as a psycho joker-type smile"
161,[deleted]
162,"Honestly, I echo the sentiment of the other commenters, that this is obviously written to serve your own purpose, but you still come off as being in the wrong. Everyone has covered all the other bases, but I wanted to touch on this- are you honestly offended that your husband told her that she looked beautiful on her wedding day? 

I am not trying to cut you down, but maybe you should consider therapy for your jealousy and insecurity. If you continue like this, it's possible that your husband will grow tired of the constant struggle and leave. "
163,That can be part of it. But *planning* (and relatively far out) for another dog her husband doesn't want/ they can't afford doesn't fit. That's just her plainly not GAF what he thinks.
164,"That's a very good point...I'm assuming that as a child, they made him eat leftovers? However, if he saw his mum cook something with ketchup once and refused to eat anything she ever cooked again, I bet that has something to do with it, too. What else does this extend to? What other foods? It can get very exasperating quickly.

My mum is a bit of the same way. My brother and my dad never think they can eat leftovers, even if it was just from that morning and we eat it again for supper (like if eggs, rice, and bacon were cooked for breakfast, then we had leftover rice to eat with supper.) My mum has gotten clever with it, and just told them it was cooked fresh, and they never notice the difference, unless they saw her put it on their plates. It works for them, because otherwise we'd have *so much wasteful food.* Even more than with OP's boyfriend, actually.

I'm not like OP's boyfriend, but I'm a bit psychosomatic. If I think something tastes funny, I can't eat it anymore, so my mum does the same thing to me as she does with my brother and dad...difference is that I don't mind. As long as I don't see it, I can trick my brain into thinking it's fine, and I'm perfectly happy."
165,"Possibly. Could be the Adderall interacting badly with an undiagnosed condition. The month prior to my mom's cancer diagnosis, she was going through the same type of physchotic breaks that OP's fiance is going through. It wasn't until her 10th admittance to the hospital, someone decided to do full blood work and discovered that she had three types of cancer, all of which were interacting badly with the various medicines she was on for other stuff (which turned out to be misdiagnosed stuff that was actually the cancer). Once they switched her off those meds, she started to go back to her normal mental state."
166,"Yeah, something is only an issue if it affects your ability to function and get along with other people.  If I was spitting out food someone had made for me, I'd probably consider that a big enough deal, but maybe not everyone does.  It's definitely more than a ""dislike"" at that point, though.  "
167,"&gt; your whole post comes across as very braggy 

I really don't get that at all, and I don't find it very hard to believe that people who are struggling, or who just don't have the financial freedom that OP does _are_ jealous. It's human nature.

The fact that a lot of people in OP's life compare their situations to hers and envy her doesn't necessarily mean she's insensitively flaunting her good fortune; if they knew her when she had less $, they may just think ""Why her and not me?""

178,"I have a question: are their safe/harmless ways to put them off?  When we first moved to our new place (pretty woodsy, very few neighbors), they would come up a lot because the people before would leave cat food on the porch.  It's now been at least 7 months since there's been food they could access, but i saw one hanging out on the deck during the day within the last week.  

I love them and would love to magically have a raccoon buddy, but the closest house to us has kids and it worries me how brave these critters are with people (had a couple try to walk up to me while I was outside and wasn't quick to run away to loud noises/big movements)."
179,"This guy is making a *classic* divorce mistake, and it should be a major red flag to you for just how short-sighted he is. He should NOT start dating before a marriage is a officially dissolved. He is not emotionally ""starving"" and he doesn't need you or anyone else right now. What he needs to do, is take care of business and terminate the legal bonds that keep him tied to another person if he is 100% serious about ending it. 

Want to know what drags out divorces? Extramarital relationships. Those relationships do one of two things: 1) show the separated spouse how much they actually love/miss about their soon-to-be ex and actually drive them *back* to their soon-to-be-ex, or 2) provide fuel to the divorce fire that could have otherwise been contained. 

You are not crazy at *all* for not wanting to be physical with him. But I'd recommend putting more distance between the two of you and finding someone with a little more sense. "
180,"Because many of the issues posted here involve abuse.

Now is the time for setting boundaries and limiting contact and hoping to god that this poor woman's mother can be trained and corrected with consequences for her actions. You know, like a bad dog.

At this point, I don't think you can change your husband's mind. Your decision is to either cancel the adoption and try to work on your marriage, or announce that you'd like to proceed with the adoption on your own as a single mother, if the bio mom and the agency would allow. "

203,"This is no more his business than your scars were theirs. I firstly find it odd that the cashier asked so many questions; I work with the public and recently encountered a young woman who I knew, through routine communication, is associated with a young folks rehab center. She had cuts up and down her arms. I didn't acknowledge them and I certainly didn't ask. But alas, you cannot control the behavior of others; I just find the questioning to be in poor taste.

Following from that, your bf should understand your unwillingness to expose such a personal part of yourself to a complete stranger. It's not up to him whether you tell the truth to them or anyone else. I know he's likely associating this with your ""ability to lie"" but that is beyond immature. He's turning this - which is about you and how you feel and cope with your history - into something about his own insecurity.

I am not suggesting that you go the nuclear route but you need to nip this one in the bud. Gently yet firmly sit him down and explain that you don't feel comfortable sharing such details and would appreciate his understanding. Ask him to explain why he's so angry."
204,Well I hate to bust your bubble but other girls will find him attractive. He's a person not a possession.
205,"&gt;But I am upset because working was my burden to shoulder. I wanted to suffer through the daily grind so that she wouldn't have to. 

Everyone seems to be reacting the same way to this, because this thinking is not helpful.

This would be my proposal:  Why don't YOU stay home?  You regard work as a grind.  Your wife doesn't.  You two have already planned on living with one income alone.  And you're worried about the attention your daughter is getting.

212,"&gt;How is it appropriate to fawn over another woman like you wish you were the one marrying her at the wedding?

Nothing you have described could be construed as 'fawning'. What, they danced? They looked at each other? They talked? They laughed? What on earth is inappropriate about that?

You are projecting. You are projecting SO hard. And your projection is destroying your marriage. You need therapy.

&gt;I do not think I'm wrong for that.

You are wrong. But hey, if you can't handle the subtle way in which he apparently 'fawns' over her, then divorce him. 

But you are not allowed to ban him from seeing her. He hasn't done anything wrong and you're acting like a crazy person."

&gt; I approached him very sympathetically because I knew the stress he was under and he denied it all and Very defensively saying ""I don't need this shit with all I'm going though.""

Are you missing this? She literally did give him a chance - *very sympathetically* - to come clean and he treated her like shit for it."
214,"I strongly suggest checking out r/justnomil and taking some time to evaluate whether your mother is *one of those*. If your gf's complaints are accurate, there may be issues with parental overattachment, codependency, overly controlling behavior or even a Jocasta complex going on with your mother. 

If she is raising concerns about these things, it is because you cannot simultaneously make your mother the #1 woman in your life and have a healthy relationship with a partner. "
215,"This. It's about setting boundaries in one's own home. Call it female nesting behavior, whatever. You might not be too bothered with it because it's your mother, but for your girlfriend, it's kind of an intrusion on privacy and control of how she wants to make her home as she sees fit. I have the same problem with my MIL. "
216,"Yup, OP if you haven't realized this yet, please do. You've saved a whole bunch of kids from suffering. "
217,"Your mom's behavior is totally inappropriate. She absolutely needs to be taught to back off, and YOU -- not your GF -- need to be the one to do that. 

When you talk to your mom about this stuff -- which you should -- DO NOT make it about your GF. That will just drive a wedge between them. Don't be like, ""well, Julie was really upset about this..."" 

No. Do not throw her under the bus. Your mom is the one in the wrong here. 

You need to tell your mom that WE (you and your GF) need her to be more respectful of YOUR (shared) privacy and choices.

Get on your GF's team real quick here or be prepared for your relationship to go down the tubes. "

222,And then you both went to the gym right?
223,"Pfew, what an infuriating read.

Alright, immediate first thought from an outsider's perspective: consider that your boyfriend has been lying to you about his previous relationship. Given his current attitude towards you, your money, and his blatant lying about his efforts around the house I would not be surprised if he was not exactly telling the truth about how he got ""financially screwed over"".

Second, he is blatantly disrespectful of you, your boundaries and your needs. I get that the assertive, playful-aggressive lines may be enticing and sexy but **that behavior should not continue outside of a sexual context**. You appear to be in a dominant-submissive sexual dynamic but that only works if he understands and respects you, otherwise **it is abuse, plain and simple**. 

I'm really sorry that you are in this place again OP, but you appear to have settled for yet another abusive relationship that only seems less abusive because it was not as blatantly bad as your previous one. From the sound of it I doubt you will get what you need and deserve from this man, but if you want to try you will have to sit him down and make some *very* clear demands if he wants to keep you. Communicate your needs, communicate your boundaries, and if he doesn't listen or talks back to you, get out. 

You absolutely deserve respect, and you *do not* have to settle for less. You can take care of yourself financially and emotionally, you don't *need* this guy, so it all comes down to what you want. "
224,"I hope you don't take this the wrong way. Me and my partner were married to the business, NO. The start of the business is always the toughest part and once you maintain the growth, it is relatively easy to manage. I didn't get married until the company was well into running smoothly.

&gt; makes me think he is right in feeling that way, its like he was taking revenge out on you for being distant and preoccupied (too busy)

We just came back from 3 week vacation from Italy and Greece. Trust me when I say, all the time we were married he didn't have a problem with my attention. The only problem he had was my friendship with James.

What sort of guidance have you been given by your parents?"
228,"A word of advice...

Not fighting 'very' often isn't great phrasing. Fights not being *'extremely'* bad is even worse phrasing. Plus you decided to talk about this highly charged situation while drinking which, for real dude, was not a good decision at all.

Are you controlling or abusive? Not in my opinion. Could you get some communication help? Yes. Both of you could. I think you need to not think about this as 'being open with that stuff' because the communication issue seems to be getting worse. Her throwing out the 'Maybe you are controlling and I just didn't see it' was seriously hurtful and, in her drunk state, probably deliberately so. If this problem gets any worse you really are both going to be fighting *very* often and it's going to get *extremely* bad.

You feel stuck, accused of something you don't understand, and don't know what to do next, right? *Counseling* is what you do next. A professional 3rd party to help you is what you do next. "

231,"Seriously, I wouldn't say anything about weight to a former anorexic.  If she relapses, there's a serious risk of death.  It's a really dangerous illness.  You don't have to stay with her if you're not attracted to her, but don't push her back into anorexia.  She's better off being single than being dead.  

And I'm sure she's smart enough to figure out what you mean when you say ""Let's get healthy together!"" or cook low-fat meals at home.  That's so transparent a child can see through it.  For a normal overweight person, there's nothing wrong with doing that - they know what you mean and they know you're doing that out of love.  But for an anorexic, this is dangerous as hell.  

"
232,"First off, there are people of varying levels of attractiveness everywhere in the world. Gorgeous people, average people, meh people, hideous people, they're all there. There are successful, happy, well-adjusted people in the US who don't look like supermodels. I can promise you the same is true of the UK and any other nation.

I'm sorry men have been so cruel to you. No one deserves that kind of treatment. If we're being honest, when it comes to attractiveness, the bar for women is way higher than men. We're expected to do so much more just to be considered desirable, whereas men can get away with the bare fucking minimum - sometimes even less - and people are fine with the way look. It's not fair at all and I'm sorry you've been treated so badly because of this double standard

That said, there are things you can do to make yourself physically desirable to others. I won't address the weight aspect - if you want to lose weight, you can do that. I've known gorgeous women of all different sizes / body types, so, to me, losing weight is *not* a necessary prerequisite to being beautiful.

**Some ideas:** 

* figuring out a makeup routine

* finding a hair salon and having a stylist figure out the most flattering cut and color for you

* upgrading your wardrobe to clothes that are flattering *and* make you feel confident / comfortable. 

* getting your eyebrows done (they frame the face and can TOTALLY change the way you look)

* if you've got issues with your skin, seeing a dermatologist and getting on a skincare regimen

All of these require time, resources, and money, but if you have an internet connection, you have access to free resources that will teach you how to do all this stuff. Beauty is effort, which sucks. I can tell you for a fact that if I stopped wearing makeup, threading my eyebrows, taking care of my skin / hair, and dressing semi-nicely, guys might call me ugly too. 

What I'm trying to say is that so much of what society considers ""attractive"" is just shit that we do to ourselves and put on our faces and bodies. If I and so many other women can put it on and take it off every day, so can you, I promise.

Oh, and take some selfies. Figure out your angles and work them. Reddit hates them, but taking selfies is an awesome way to start feeling better about yourself.

237,"This is ridiculous OP. Your boss has no right telling you to walk women to their cars as protection. You are not a trained security guard. You could sue the company into bankruptcy if anything ever happened to you during these walks you were forced to do for protection when you're not a security guard.

If your boss is so invasive and involved, then why not report to her the racist garbage being spewed right in front of you? You don't have to put up with that! This is hostile work environment that discriminates on the basis of race. That is a protected class, this is illegal, and you have every right to report it. "

I wonder if you're considering this so you can ask the guy if he knew and then ""throat punch"" him."

241,"It's actually really easy to fall in love with someone.
You create emotional connection where you focus. In this situation, you focused on this woman. You fed your interest. You filled in the curiosity by spending couple times a week, every week for 6 months.

Not once did you stop and say ""wtf am I doing?"". You voluntarily  allowed your thoughts to fixate on this woman.

Now you're here. Obsessed with your infatuation. (because it's not love). Unhappy with your current life and chasing a life of mystery. 

You know how people stay in relationships with passion? They create it. They choose their spouse instead of a stranger. They mentally block any new romantic interests. Love is a verb. You love and appreciate something you worked hard for. And that should have been your wife. 


Leave. But you're going to learn a big, hard lesson on your own. And at that point, it will be too late. You will be forever separated from your family. You'll be witnessing YOUR kids being spoiled by another man, and YOUR wife being appreciated by another man. You will be on the sidelines with the life you chose out of curiosity and temptation.

Goodluck.

P.S - Your kids will be able to say ""Daddy left for another woman"" for the rest of their lives."

Why didn't the husband know, was it an affair?  

Why didn't BF shut her down HARD when she started acting inappropriately?  Sounds like it went on for a while.  

Why did you think ""this girl who slept with my bf is twerking on him, I should just keep the peace."" is the right step?

246,"I don't think that the lies are completely divorced from her asexuality. It's easy to convince yourself to have sex for any number of reasons that aren't actually desiring sex in the moment. Maybe she thought that if she just did sex ""right"" it would click for her, or that being uninterested in sex is just how most women are, or that once her relationship was deeper and more secure she'd start to enjoy things. Yes, she *should* have been honest with OP, but if she herself didn't know what the truth was, how could she?"

249,Your husband sounds adorable

That's rape. You're not giving consent. It doesn't matter that he's your husband or that he isn't violent, he's having sex with you without your consent. In fact, 30% of adult rape cases are committed by husbands, common-law partners, or boyfriends."
251,"Most likely because the MIL will be an insufferable brat and the fiancee wants to maintain a relationship with her parent. Honestly the best way to hndle it is if MIL doesnt like it, don't come. Simple as that. Sure there will be drama but frankly its her own mess and consequence. "
252,"So don't see him.  But there's no need to be unfriendly.  Why not keep it to email?  Tell him that though he's lost his mom, you're sure he doesn't have any regrets about having had the mom he did.  But that you're sorry he lost her.  Tell him you'd feel too awkward meeting him and really can't get involved, that you've closed that chapter of your life, but that you may be willing to answer some questions he may have.  Can you do that?  It's normal for him to be curious even if his mother hadn't died.  Especially tell him any medical history, and keep things short if you don't want to delve.

You might resent even the thought of any communication with this child.  But I'd recommend to simply get it out of the way.  Give this kid some answers, by email only, so that he goes away having at least an inkling of where he came from, while also understanding that you are gently closing the door of ever meeting in person.

Be glad he threw this temper tantrum so you don't need to find a polite way to refuse his invitations in the future.

I believe you did have an alcohol problem in the past and you have largely come out of it but possibly not entirely, and I'm concerned that the method with which you did was quite unhealthy, being essentially forced / guilted to by your husband who now holds you so tightly under his thumb you live an entirely different life, you ask him for permission to do things you should have control over yourself, and he is liable to lash out at you and attack your parenting because you take a planned night away once in two years. 

I think you are best to separate - it's like he's had a low level of dissatisfaction and lack of respect for you for the entire time you've been married and prior. I'm unsure whether his stance is completely warranted or whether this has been a long game of manipulation and control. His references to past broken promises is one area of concern - whereas you believed you had lived to the letter of your promise to him, he perceived or at least told you you'd let him down and used that as rationale to tighten his leash. My worry is that a) you may still have an alcohol problem since you describe that the few times you've drank recently it has been to the point of drunkenness, b) you have chosen to drive drunk repeatedly in your life including very recently - honestly you should know better even if your asshole husband is guilting you for not being home, and c) your husband may be readying to use your past alcohol problems as fuel against you in your separation. 

Again, there is a lot going on here. Please see a therapist and consult a lawyer immediately. Give up drinking ENTIRELY for the entirety between now and when your split takes effect. Document your life in terms of how you spend your time, how frequently you have drank in the last two years, and work on figuring out (after your split) whether you can drink in moderation (ie, a single glass of wine because you enjoy it, not deciding to have a glass and that turning into four)."

Him kicking her out, accusing her of lying about the infertility and accusing her of cheating? No. That's the bit that is unacceptable"
272,And it has the added bonus of looking like a good host who came prepared to make everyone drinks. If you really want bonus points pick up a cheese plate or some sort of snack tray as well. 
273,"Dude, if she's into it, she probably had this thing picked out a while ago, and for all you know has saved her pennies for months to get it. This is a new relationship. You are totally level jumping.

You are really grasping at straws here to justify your emotions. Ask yourself why this exclusion is bothering you so much. If it's something you think would be fun, then tell her you want to learn about and go pick out your own fur. I suspect it has nothing to do with the hobby and more to do with you feeling slighted for some weird reason. "
274,"Withholding sex is abusive if you're doing it out of spite for something unrelated. Not having sex because your boyfriend just jams it in and doesn't notice/care if you're in pain is not immature or abusive. She's not obligating to continue having painful sex she doesn't want just because they're dating. She isn't withholding sex, she's refusing to lay there and be used like a fleshlight. "
275,"It doesn't sound like she's trying not to be a burden, honestly. She's ignoring your wishes. You told her you didn't want furniture and yet she keeps buying it. Disrespecting you is burdensome.

You need to sit your mom down and lay out some rules for living with you. No buying you stuff and she has to try to find a job. You should also insist on her paying rent, even if it's small. That way, you don't have to worry about her manipulating you somehow with the bills, like ""if I'm paying for x, I should have some say over it"" or something. 

Honestly though, I think this might blow up in your face anyway. It sounds like your mom isn't planning on leaving. She's trying to take over your home. If I were your wife, I'd be a wreck right now."
276,"&gt; her parents are paying for most, if not all, of the wedding.

If you want independence on the planning and execution, don't take their money. 

If they are paying for the entire thing, they get a say. "
277,"Postpone the wedding, possibly until next year.  Save up money.  Take the time to pay for it yourselves and have the wedding you want, where you two make all of the decisions, even if you have to simplify it a bit to stay in budget.

When you let parents pay for things, parents get to have a say in things.  "
278,Do you want to end up a broke old woman because of this guy's inability to save or understand the modern banking system? Is that the life you want to lead 10 or 20 years in the future? 
279,"Yeah, I suspected you've broken up and quickly gotten back together again multiple times before. That's a staple of the shitty codependent couple playbook. Your situation sounds like another one of those breaks where you'll hold out until being lonely makes you more miserable than being wirh the other person, then go crawling back to each other. I would encourage you to seriously consider breaking the cycle. "
280,"No, not good enough. Listen I'm a married man of eleven years. DO NOT LET HIM PUT IT IN YOU UNTIL YOU CUM FIRST! You'll be surprised how accommodating he'll be when you make him work for sex :)"
281,"I think you also have a husband problem, and probably should update your post to reflect this information. "
282,Oh please. A 22 year old woman went on a spontaneous beach vacation with her friend and wore bathing suits and summer dresses and drank alcohol and her boyfriend of 6 months doesn't like it. You have to be possessive and jealous to get upset about that. Additionally his comments indicate that he's sex-negative and sexist and thinks poorly of her because she's had multiple sex partners. 
283,"&gt; she had stumbled upon them

...while she was snooping. 

Yeah, not okay or normal. When she saw the envelope or whatever you had them in, she knew it wasn't hers. But she looked anyway and then had the nerve to ""throw away"" something that belonged to you? (I'm picturing more angrily tearing them up. She probably also immediately tried to Facebook stalk whoever it was or some dumb petty thing.)

MAJOR red flag. "
284,"I am pregnant with my first and I have cut out a big chunk of family, including all grandparents. I will not let certain people even meet her. It hurts a little knowing she won't have much family but I'm not letting her into a similar situation as you. No trust (after multiple attempts to regain it) means no access to me or my family."
285,"Yeah, I think I'm going to try again being more neutral about the name. 

This isn't necessarily the hill that I want to die on, but it's still a pretty big one. I would be fine if I got to choose the middle name and just call the baby that. I actually don't know if she's chosen a middle name too because we've been so focused on the first name."
286,"I think you are being ghosted. It sucks, but it happens sometimes when people can't be up front about how they really feel.

From an outsider looking in, it looks like she may have used you - and you gave too much too soon when she didn't really show much credibility of trust. I would cut your losses and move on."
287,"It's your kid, too. You're going to have to force the issue."
288,"Yeah I was going to suggest writing a speech, recording it, and sending it so the brother could play it at the wedding when the best man traditionally gave his speech"

Everyone is a target for proselytism, and anyone who rejects the ideology is a threat. After a while, all your close friends are either people you've converted to the cause, or people you've met who were already in the ""church"", because you've chased away everyone else with your aggressive evangelism and creepy zealotry. It becomes your whole life, and then you can't leave without losing your entire social circle.

296,"&gt;On one hand, I do want him to feel like its ""our"" apartment, and not just him staying in mine. On the other hand, if I'm paying for everything, I think its fair I have most of the buying &amp; design decisions. I'm not sure if i'm being unreasonable/selfish here.

The middle ground statement would be that you shouldn't be buying anything that you wouldn't be alright with keeping should you guys go your separate ways, since in all likelihood you would be keeping it since it was your money.

However, if you want him to feel like it is ""our"" apartment instead of ""your"" apartment, you can't say ""my money, my rules"" and expect him to feel at home.

Is there nowhere your tastes overlap? Are there not things that you care about more and that he cares about more where you could lean more one way or another?"

Throw away because my husband is on reddit. 

I've learned a lot on this sub from you all and I want to say thank you. I'm sorry I am not the most eloquent and I apologize if my thoughts are rambling on unclear. And I will explain why. 

My husband has always worked in big businesses where he was always provided health insurance. And I have always worked in small local businesses where I would have to buy my own health insurance. We were married a little more than a year ago and when we were wed I was put on his health insurance. Everything was great and we had such a bright future. We were even thinking of having a child. Now I can't even look past a week without falling apart.

Unfortunately I took after my mom and have both her bad back and genetic mental health issues. The mental issues are generalized anxiety and chronic depression.  I have a psychiatrist that is so helpful and I haven't had a panic attack in at least 5 years. My back has both spinal stenosis and degenerative disc disease. Basically my spine has both thinned and also lost the pads between each spine so bone is grinding against bone. It always hurts. That wasn't diagnosed until about 4 months ago because I couldn't afford a CT scan with my old insurance. But I have had back pain for over 8 years. 

My husband is somehow completely different than me and also just like me. We fit like a complex puzzle. He was so great to put me on his insurance. 

This is the hard part.  He was asked by a friend to change jobs and work from home. I was hesitant because we would lose our health insurance and I was just scheduled to get an epidural that may or may not help my back pain. And if the epidural doesn't help then I would probably need surgery.  My husband said that we would be able to keep our insurance. My husband also all of a sudden hated his current job. He told me he wouldn't make the decision without my consent but also basically said he would be unhappy if he stayed at his job. I felt cornered and so I said yes. But I also said we need to find out more about health insurance and take it slow. He quickly put in his two weeks without me knowing he would do it so fast. He said we won't go without insurance. But I told him it's a complicated process and so much more than when a job provides health insurance.  

Luckily I got the epidural before our insurance ended but it lasted for only two weeks. My pain is relentless. I had to leave my job and be put on bed rest. I can barely walk. I was recommended by 3 different doctors to get surgery. But I can't get the surgery. 
 
I trusted that my husband had the insurance taken care of. I thought he had already bought it. But he didn't keep an eye on it and now this month we are without health insurance. 

I've gone from a healthy and active person that exercises to be only able to be in bed or on the couch. My medication is so expensive I have had to borrow money from my parents. I have to pay out of pocket for everything. It is the most shameful feeling to ask this at my age. If my husband kept his old job for a little longer I would have already had the surgery over a week ago. 

Every day becomes more painful mentally.  I can't feel hope. My thoughts are dark and frightening. My mental illnesses have been amplified and now I have panic attacks and suicidal thoughts. I have to take more medication for it and for my pain. So My mind is foggy half of the time. The other half is a hard reality to face. I resent my husband for promising me over and over he would handle it since I am so clouded. 

But he didn't make sure we had insurance and I have to pay a heavy price for it. Everyday my resentment grows. I talk to him and he gives excuses. I need his help but I also don't want to be around him. I have three more weeks until our insurance is in and I can be scheduled for surgery. But every day feels like a week. I don't know where to go or what to do. I barely can keep my head above water let alone work through our marital problems. I fear we won't recover the trust and love in our relationship. Please please an ideas or advice could make a huge difference in my life. 

TL;DR I need back surgery and my husbands negligence has led to me not being able to have the surgery and it's killing our marriage."
299,"Yup, there's a saying in Germany that goes, ""mornings like an emperor, afternoon (lunch) like a king, and evenings like a beggar"". Normally for dinner my family has smaller, lighter things to eat, like a bit of bread with cheese and some fresh veggies.  
  
However, this varies for many people, my family included, depending on what everyone is doing during the day. I imagine if the OP is making something from scratch that's fresh for lunch time, it could take an hour to prep and cook.  
  
edit: typo"
300,"This. Also, how is their presence a positive for your child? You're teaching her that abusive people are okay if they're faaaaamily."
301,I like your suggestion about sitting down to determine boundaries. I think it might make a difference if I could show her I'm committed to her and want a long term relationship. 
302,"Viewing it as cheating might be an extreme but cheating is really just going outside the boundaries you and your partner have set up. In the case of the OP he knew he was breaking it.

You're right that there's no direct interaction but watching someone else being naked and intimate isn't okay with everyone and who are you to say they are wrong in feeling that way? "
303,"My first reaction on hearing this story was ""OH HELL NO!"" Emotional reactions aside, I know how challenging it is to parent this age group, and it's important to show that you mean what you say. Please for the sake of this little girl, do not budge on this teaching her that badgering people is how to get what she wants. 

I agree that establishing boundaries right away great idea. All you have to do it state calmly ""I won't be giving you my phone. End of discussion."" And importantly - do not engage further. This niece already sounds like a strong-willed child who has learned that she can outlast and badger her way of out trouble with the rest of the family. There are some great books and resources out there for parents and family of strong-willed children. I personally like ""Setting Limits with Your Strong-Willed Child""; maybe you could buy it, read it, and pass it along to your sister. She clearly needs some parenting help. "
304,"I am imagining your daughter in therapy 20 or 30 years from now:  ""But WHY didn't my mother protect me? How can I trust her with MY child?""

Just break the cycle now. Make it a clean 100% break. "
305,"The fact that he's posting here with ""what tips do you guys have for proposing"" tells me he actually doesn't seem to know what she'll like."
306,"Big age gap. Moving across state to be with him for 4 months. Hiding criminal activity from you.

These are red flags and it's not a minor crime like not paying some parking fines or something, these are serious. "
307,"I'm really banking on this being a troll, but I also have suspicions that this is written from the perspective of the girlfriend, who is normally just sad about her relationship with her terrible choice of a companion, but has snapped a little, just enough to post this here to vent a little. Either way, good luck real-life-person who wrote this.

If this isn't a troll, seek help. You know what's wrong with you, and you may even be a little concerned at how nonchalant you are about it right now. The only gift you can give this woman to make it up to her is to leave, and never contact her again. Seriously, your life doesn't have to be a string of disappointing yourself."
308,"OP said in comments that she did cheat, and that this has been going on for a year. "
309,I just don't know how drunk one would have to get in order to not recognize their partner. I can really tie one on... But I've never not recognized my friends/dates. 
310,"The closer you get to him the more comfortable he'll be around you and the episodes will happen way more often. My ex had BPD anxiety and alcohol addiction. When I first met him about 6 months in he had a freak out where we were made to leave a party because of his actions. A few months later it happened again in a different situation. It got to where is was every major event that was supposed to be happy he'd freak out and ruin it. It became the normal. I had to leave, too damaging to me."
311,"I bet a LOT of men do not have this conversation. 

Whenever a heartbroken 18 or 24 year old man posts here saying his life is ruined because he got his girlfriend pregnant and she won't get an abortion, and it's so unfair, and men have no rights, blah blah....  If he seems like a decent guy I give him the talk that his parents should have given him at 14: How men have plenty of rights, but rights come with responsibilities like wearing a condom and having conversations. 

Btw, you didn't mention whether this woman uses birth control. If you really don't want children, you should make sure you and your partner each use a form of BC, especially if your partner won't get an abortion. Condom only could be risky."
312,[deleted]
313,"This. OP, he's pushing his boundaries. Just wait until the comparison to other women comes along.

If my boyfriend said anything like that to me, he'd be put in his place. I could never, EVER say something like that to him either.

Doesn't your boyfriend like making you feel good? Why does your boyfriend make you feel insecure? My boyfriend's comments on my body are to build me up, not to tear me down."
314,"Lots of women can keep surprises secret, even from their best friend. Just like there are lots of men who can't keep a secret to save their life. It really all depends on the individual and has little to do with gender. 

It may be hard to not act more excited than usual but that doesn't mean that there isn't at least one friend who could take her to get a manicure and not give away the surprise if OP decided to go that route. "
315,Thank you so much for this comment. It really helps in calming me down.
316,"You went above and beyond. Gave her multiple chances to get her life together and secure. 

 She is choosing this. If she wants to be your friend without mooching off you, that's one thing, but her friendship is now contingent on you financially supporting her bad choices. 

What about her daughter? Were you honorary aunties? Can you stay in her daughter's life, help her dad and give the girl two positive role models and two more adults who love her and are reliably there for her? 

A mother like that is really painful for a kid, she needs all the good, loving people in her life she can get.

319,"&gt;Girls don't lose it then feel like they lost they're innocence or that they've changed?

Umm no, you have a really creepy idea of women losing their virginity.

Just no. Idek what else to say."
320,Architecture seems brutal af. My SIL is doing it and has had multiple meltdowns due to the stress. That's why I've always hated how much they would shit on Ted on How I met your mother. 
321,"woman non mormon dating a mormon here. I think it would be better to hear from both sides (both ex-mormons/mormons) about this. My partner thinks your gf is being totally unfair to you, its her responsability towards her sexuality. Then again, he is a dude and I don't know how the church deal with women's sexuality. So yeah, I think it would be worth hearing about it."
322,Now's a better time than any. He's gonna get burned sooner or later and he hasn't been making an attempt. Do it.
323,[deleted]
324,"I totally agree with your last statement. If my partner was telling me he's 100% exhausted and can not do one more social event, I would be understanding. I'd put his feelings over anybody else's. If having to explain to people why your partner can't attend, just day he's sick! It's not that hard. "
325,"I worked with immigrants who frequently ended up naming their kids weird names hoping to pick very American/western names as a symbol of the new culture. My favorites:

327,"Well, if you didn't kick the girl out of your house maybe you could ask her. "
328,"Don't exclude your fourth child. Your daughter won't view it your way until she's an adult, by which point the relationship will have been damaged. Your child will notice and will feel less than her siblings. Don't set up your child for that. "
329,"When I read the title of your post I immediately thought ""well, okay, I bet OP isn't paying her and didn't give her parameters and this is the result."" Then I read the post - you're really *not* overreacting. The way she treated your animals is kinda inhumane in my opinion, given the weather conditions. I'd feel extremely hurt if a friend whose pets I'd cared for before couldn't return that favor properly.

It could partially be the thing I mentioned - that she didn't have parameters so she thought what she was doing was 'okay' or whatever, but in the heat... it's common sense.

I'm a big pet person so I think something like this would honestly impact my friendship (I'd absolutely think less of someone and not want much to do with them if they were like that), but I also hate conflict so I might just quietly get a pet sitter. The ""nice"" way to put it is to say that you're gonna get a pet sitter next time because you're finding that your pets need a little more hands-on attention. "
330,"Cracking undervalues what's going on.

Her religious values HAVE broken, since it's Mormonism we're talking about here.


 Sex is a big deal in that religion. If she repents appropriately for it, she confesses and goes through an extended period of time (I'm talking months here) where she, for sake of brevity, isn't recognized as a full member, does not receive certain religious privileges from God during that time, and all-in-all is literally branded as ""less-than"" im her own mind. It isn't made public knowledge and is kept very hush hush but that is how her psyche will view it and treat herself... a very serious ""less than.""



And it's not that she can't enter heaven, it's that she can't enter higher tiers of heaven which is also a big deal being a member. I won't go into detail but it's worth noting.



She is about to go through an emotional and psychological roller-coaster. She might run off the tracks and spin out and crash. She might land on some new tracks. She might go off a big jump and land on the same tracks. 


My point is she is about to drastically change if she wants to be right with herself again. I highly suggest a therapist to help her work through that even though religion is deeply rooted in it. It's less about religion and more about her perception of herself. That perception just also happens to includes themes that other humans made a religion about which turns the issue from a ""Am I OK in my eyes?"" to ""Am I okay to these irrelevant things I've forced on myself?""


This will lead to... are these things me? Yes no? If they aren't do I still think I should? Do I ignore it? Etc. Etc.


The only way this resolves is if she quits the religion or if she goes through a painstaking process to getting right with God again. Both of these trails entail her identifying that aspect as a part of herself which is already a massive deal that can take months if not years. That's answering ONE QUESTION... is it me or not me? Then the rabbit hole ensues.

333,The other religons don't send people to your house for the express purpose of paying that tithe.
334,"&gt; Idk, I think moving in together this soon is a bad idea, but an even worse idea is supporting someone financially this early, especially when they have other options.

I totally agree with all of this, I just think that the advice is muddied by the fact that a lot of commenters are assigning blame as if the BF is some habitual leech who somehow con'ed OP into paying for his ""lifestyle"", when none of the given evidence supports that.  There may be some bad decision making going on here on both parts, but I don't think either party is a bad person."

337,"OP isn't responsible fr helping her build that emotional intelligence, though. In general, I don't see a lot of benefit in accepting toxic people into your life voluntarily. If she wants a relationship, she isn't in the position to have one, and she'll drown OP imstead of being ""saved."""
338,"Dude, she moved in with another guy, got pregnant, and tried to emotionally manipulate you into fathering the child when she got dumped. Get the fuck out. You're never going to get over this, and you shouldn't. 39 is still young enough to move on with your life. I got married at 38 and I am happy as a clam. Every year you stay, though, is going to make it harder to be on the singles market."
339,SHE MADE OUT WITH ANOTHER DUDE ON YOUR FIRST DATE?!  And you were cool with that?  Are you like the biggest doormat in the world?  
340,"Yep. There's controlling for control's sale, like telling your wife she must wear certain clothes or spanking a child for microwaving a sandwich instead of eating it cold, and then there is ""controlling"" because the alternative is watching paramedics pull your dead wife's body out of her totalled car at three in the morning.  "
341,"If you have spent the last 6months complaining and looking for things to complain about instead of trying to make the situation into a happy one (like making friends, finding hobbies and generally building a life) then I can see where he is coming from. You seem unhappy where you are.

348,"You need to start giving him firm ""no"" answers.  Your soft ""no""s are unclear and are dragging this situation out.  

I think you should text him something like:
""Tom, please stop inviting me to things and coming to my door.  It bothers me when you do this.  If I want to hang out, I will reach out.""  

Or 

""Tom, you upset me last night when you came to my door and wouldn't leave.  You need to stop coming to my door.  You need to stop inviting me to things.  I will let you know if I want to hang out.""

Or 

""Tom, I'm not comfortable hanging out with you alone.  Please stop asking me.""

Or 

""Tom, I need to focus on myself now.  I do not have time or energy for a friendship with you.  Please stop texting me and coming to my door.""

These messages are blunt, and they will hurt his feelings.  But they are not cruel. His feelings need to be hurt at this point, because his behaviour is inappropriate and the feeling-sparing de-escalation didn't work on him.  The messages don't accuse him of anything, but they do clearly establish the things he needs to stop doing. They avoid mitigating language like ""I don't have time right now"" because he'll interpret that to mean that he should come back next week.  

Don't send him a novel about why you can't hang out - that just sets the stage for him to think he can negotiate or persuade.  Send him something short and clear.  You will be tempted to throw in mitigating language to soften the blow.  Do not do that, it will make your message unclear.  

If he responds badly to your message, tell him that he is scaring you and that if he continues you will have to get the police involved.  Then get the police involved.    "

351,"I had an ex who cheated on me, lied to me, strung me along and after the breakup up later disrespected me multiple times. I ended up being 1600 miles away from her for a while. I'm now in a situation where I have to work with and see her almost every day at work, and we share the same friends so we once in a while have to see eachother and all hang out. 

Her topics of convo are her judgemental attitude towards some things and people, and continuous discussion about the girl she's with now, the one she cheated on me with. 

Thing is, I let it go. She and I aren't friends but I don't have any reason to do anything outrageous either. If she is there then she is there. If we are all hanging out, it is what it is. It's not like she and I are exclusively talking to each other separately and I have no desire to do so. But if she's there, then it is what is. I have fun with my friends. 

What you did was pretty outrageous and as disrespectful as what she does. You wanna prove you're a better person about it? Leave them be. She says she doesn't know you, then you don't know them. You happen to be in the same place, whatever. You're with friends and she joins, whatever. She wants to talk to you exclusively, say no and leave respectfully. 

People are who they are. Don't give anyone any reason you can't move on and be better.  "
352,"&gt; I don't know if I should contact a lawyer about this?

If you have a copy of the will and can do so discretely it might be better for your piece of mind to do so.  You should keep in mind, though, that just because your sister's influenced her decision (assuming they did) does not make the will invalid.  If your mother was of sound mind she is allowed to take their advice into consideration if she wants.

&gt; I'm upset that I missed all of these signs from my mom and that she was this angry/upset at me to cut me out of her will.

You mention in the comments and in your post that your mother was always very fair AND that the change happened years ago.  It does not sound out of what little I know of her character for her to have decided that if your father took your sisters out of his will, she should try to make the end result fairer to all 3 of you.

&gt; They argued that I spent more time in the past 2 years with my dad and stepmother than my own mother dying of cancer. 

Did you?  If that's the case it sounds like she may not have been upset that you didn't cut him off, just that you clearly favored him over her for your entire adult life.

&gt; I'm struggling with the idea that my mom was that angry with me but never told me.

She might have just been sad and disappointed rather than angry.  And her decision regarding the will may be unrelated to her feelings about how you handled the divorce.

&gt; What to do now?

If there are any special mementos you want to remember your mother by, talk to your sisters about them.  If you want to purchase your childhood home, talk to a bank about a mortgage and see if they'll sell it to you.

Apologize (without any rationalization) to your sisters for not stepping up to help with your mother's care.

Realizing you weren't as close to a family member as you thought can complicate the process.  Talk to a grief counselor about your mother's death if you need to.  

If you need to vent about the will, do so in a setting where there are privacy requirements -- lawyers and therapists.  Don't vent to your sisters, your aunt, etc. unless you're looking to ruin what remains of your relationship with your sisters."
353,"Have you guys ever **talked** about any of this?

&gt;But he was a careless and selfish husband. This manifested mostly in the bedroom, with him taking advantage of me, pressuring me, hurting me, and shaming me for what I did express a desire for… and otherwise dismissing things that were important to me, like where in the country we lived, or the things that filled our home (for instance, if he got tired of a piece of furniture, I would wake up and find it gone, no conversation necessary. If he wanted a job in another state, he simply took it, and away we went.)."
354,"You didn't consent. When did you say yes to him? When did you push for this to happen? It's rape.

Seriously your options are:
1) Don't invite anyone you know to a traditional wedding but having to deal with the fallout from literally...everyone you know when they find out they weren't invited.

2) Invite people you know except for parents but just don't engage with conversation that tries to emotionally blackmail you into inviting them. Literally just don't engage with any conversation about them at all.

You don't have to be satisfied with it but you do have to respect it. I mean, EXACTLY what he said was going to happen is happening now. I don't think you should talk to him expecting him to change in any way. I think you need to cut him off for a period of time until your feelings are resolved."

360,"Kissing and stuff is, but what makes me wonder if she's not overreacting is the language they use- talking about adult movies, ostensibly trying to recreate some of the behaviors in them, talking about ""humping"" and ""making out"" with tongues. If it was just the kissing I'd say sure, lots of kids do that, after all lots of adults kiss in movies. Humping and adult movies? That's more of the red flag territory and where I'd start asking where she saw this and if it was in a safe setting for her."
361,"I'm with you on this.

I'm a casual, responsible stoner. My wife knew when we were dating, and we agreed to some ground rules. They've evolved over time to the following:

Never when driving 
Keep weed and paraphernalia responsibly put away 
Not every day - if you can't remember the last day without, you're smoking too much.
Not at social events where it may be frowned upon (work functions, weddings, etc,)
Not around the kids (now that we have a family).

Soon to be enacted rule: Get a prescription. Easy to do, and could possibly save a lot of legal hassle.

I still have plenty of opportunities to get high. "
362,"Nobody is molesting anyone; they're both consenting to the activities OP describes. If you find that inappropriate, that's fine. But stopping the playdates probably isn't going to stop the behavior, as it's very common for children to engage in this kind of sex play and OP's daughter seems to enjoy it and will just as likely find another friend to do it with. Cutting off their friendship is only going to deprive OP's kid of a good friend and tell her that she should be ashamed of what she's doing. "
363,ha ha ha ha oh you were serious
364,"I remember someone had a problem with a snoop, so they cleared all the ""juicy"" stuff out (if op has a trusted friend, she should leave journals and concert shirts at friend's house) and put in a few lock boxes. Each one empty except for, like, wadded up blank paper to screw with the person. 

Not a good idea here, though, until she's an adult. 


"
365,"I know. The odds are stacked against her. It's worth asking, though.

What this guy did was really, really cruel. This is such a shit situation because even if he could come around and be a good dad- there's only 2 months. Does she really risk being saddled with a resentful, bitter co-parent? Will she be okay being a single mother if he files divorce papers in 6 months? "
366,"The way I read that comment the question would be more, what is the definition of adult movie in the eyes of the kid. Because when I, at 25, say adult movie, I mean porn. Had you asked me 20 years ago it would be movies that are for 12 and up. "
367,"It's all in how it's handled. Wanting to have an adult table seems like the norm to me.  The adults can have an adult conversation and the kids are free to be kids without parents making them behave.  It seems better for both parties. 
 The rude part is him not compromising with or being willing to talk to you about it.  I'm sure he could put the kids table in sight of the adults if you don't feel comfortable with the situation."
368,"Yeah, I doubt that you're going to be able to guide him to remorse. He's proud of ruining his brother's future. "
369,"What do you hope to gain, if he does decide to share with you his service experiences? Are you prepared for the possibility that he may have committed acts that could result in you seeing him differently, possibly negatively? There's so many ways this could go, and I can guarantee that it won't be good for either of you. 

Ultimately you know your husband better than anyone here, you married him after all. So if you really want to push for him to open up you need to sit down and ask him directly, why he doesn't talk about his service life. You will, however, need to accept that he may not want to ever talk about it for valid reasons that you may not understand, and should respect that. You should also be prepared to accept that your husband has seen and done some extremely horrific things to other human beings that almost always leave a Mark on the psyche. 

Would you really want to know about how his best friend was spontaneously discombobulated by a roadside IED and he had to survive a 12 hour firefight with said friend's remains splashed all over his face? Or perhaps how he came face to face with a child of 12years, close enough to see the blue in his eyes, filled with hate, raising an AK47 towards him with intent to kill and your husband had only moments to instinctively send a burst of 7.62mm rounds through his youthful body, exploding brain matter all over the walls and ceiling, seeing the child's face shatter like a vase. Sometimes it's best to leave it alone for the sake of your relationship and mental health.

Remember that pandoras box cannot be closed once it is opened, and you may just regret ever trying to satisfy your curiosity. You do not need to know the details of his service, only that he did serve and that he's still here."

OP needs to have someone in her life that is more involved and BF is feeling strained from not meeting the unspoken expectations of his SO. Everything about this posts suggests they're not having a mature conversation about what they want from their relationship. Instead they're in this NC standoff;

&gt;OP: I want him to desire me and seek me out, I'm going to be available and expect him to contact me.

&gt;BF: I don't want to deal with this right now, I'll just wait till she calls.

If you want something, ask for it. I'm an outgoing person, when I want to hangout with friends, I organise something! I don't wait around for someone to call me or drop by, I want to be having fun now!

Please, I don't mean this to be condescending but you are only 20 years old. The reason he is the only man you've been interested in, is because you're 20 years old. When I was 20 years old, I dated someone who was my world (well i thought) but now at 28, I couldn't even tell you his surname....

I understand he's got a problem and you're loving and want to help him but he doesn't want to help himself. You cannot put yourself on fire to keep him warm. Right now, he has no reason to sort himself out. He has a loving girlfriend who takes him back no matter and gets to sleep around on to of that. Where is his incentive to change?

He needs to want to help himself. My advice would be to give him a final ultimatum. Sort out therapy for himself within the next month (and stick with it) or else you're going. For an ultimatum to work, you have to mean it and stick with it. This means you need to leave if he doesn't get himself help. Break ups are hard, extremely hard. Break ups send me temporarily loopy but I come out the otherside so much better and you will t0o. 
"
385,"This all sounds like I'm reading one side of a story.

The first thing that strikes me as unusual here is that you're ""catching"" him jerking off rather than walking into an opportunity to help him out.

I'm sorry if that sounds crass but you haven't mentioned anywhere else in the post that you have an active sex life other than the vague ""don't neglect your spouse"" part, but it sounds a little like neglect might be a part of the problem here.

If this is a big enough issue for you that you need to develop a stomping around system or text him to warn him when you're coming home, then he apparently has a pretty high sex drive.

I mean, how many times a day do you think he's doing it, 1? 3? 10?


The reason I'm feeling like there's more to this is that your post could easily be read as a concerned mother asking how to avoid walking in on a teenage son.
Particularly the part about assuming a text from his wife is enough to kill his arousal? It should literally be the opposite.
If I like someone enough to marry them, getting a text from them would be an uplifting experience.

It sounds like this masturbation problem is a symptom of a much bigger issue with your relationship rather than a cause."

391,"Interestingly, if you read the paper you'll see that the time restricted feeding had the same number of total calories as the unrestricted feeding.  That was carefully controlled for.

416,"&gt;Not let her see her grandkids

Yeah, lets talk about her mother seeing the grandchildren. It's precisely one of the top reasons why OP can't let that fly as easily as you think she should. 

I don't know if OP wants children but if she does she has all the reasons to think that she can't let them have unsupervised visits with their grandmother because she could easily pull off that kind of things with them as well! She'd probably disregard OP's wishes as to what her children could do or eat or not and, after the fact, tell her that she did it because ""she loves them and therefore knows what's best for them"". 

That's unacceptable and if I was in OP's shoes I'd be very very concerned about the fact that my mother essentially proved that what's most important to me- and let's be real here, not eating meat for a vegetarian is pretty damn important and they have the right to feel this way- means jack shit to her. It's honestly disgusting what she did to OP and I'm not even a vegetarian.

You have very skewed views of the role of a parent in their children's lives anyway, like they have the right to do whatever because they supposedly know best, even to the point of lying, deceiving and disrespecting their kids. And OP shouldn't even demand an apology because anyway her mother won't meant it and OP should somehow feels satisfied with that??? Wtf. That's not how a healthy relationship with your children should work."

420,"&gt; I miss the thin, muscular surfer/snowboarder he was...

Is it possible that he doesn't want to be reminded of how much he has changed? That he isn't the hot surfer anymore? For a lot of people, sports is escapism. Regardless, it sounds like that is his idea of a vacation anyway:watching a bunch of men chase balls.

My mom hates sports and it's about all my dad cares about. Dad constantly gets tickets to things and mom just doesn't care for it at all and it does lead to a lot of fights. The thing they need to still figure out (and this is after 30ish years of marriage) is how to compromise. Mom chooses half of the vacation and dad chooses the other half. 

It's messed up that hubby took up more than half (almost all) of the vacation on his own interests. That's not an equal partnership, even if he did misunderstand your intentions for the trip. Maybe you can compromise, 4 sport things and 4 nights on the beach like the good old days. It seems like the fairest possible thing, although he totally owes more to ya when ya get home for messing up in my book! 

Best of luck, as always. I hope you still do figure out a compromise and can have a nice vacation. Sounds like both of you deserve one!"

What I would do is tell him about it, be vague if you need to - but tell him you have been hurt and are thus sorta slow to trust &amp; maybe even admit that some of his affection makes you feel uncomfortable. 

Try to work from where that conversation goes. If he sincerely likes you, you're giving him necessary information.

The fact that this is two girls has absolutely nothing to do with porn and everything to do with child development and the mere fact that most children have more same-gender friends than opposite-gender friends. You're being really hyperbolic here and it's not going to help OP.

She's not banning you from all sports, only football. Pick another sport."

441,"Without reading any of the other comments, that is the meanest story I've read on Reddit. To do this to his own brother. What a mother fucking bastard. God, it makes me angry just typing this out, and I don't even know you. It's scary to witness people with such clear intelligence would also be so without integrity. It's frightening. 

He did this to his brother who he knew for 25 years, versus knowing you for 18 months. He has shown his true (lack of) character. This is such a clear sign to cut and run. What might he do to you...

Ugh, I'm not going to waste anymore time. Really, just leave 😳"

443,Op you have one life for yourself. Do not accept this. You need to move on.
444,"This this this 100 times this.
Your parents want to control you, do not go with them to a place that makes it easier for them. "
445,"Why does she make you so uncomfortable? You had a fight, sure, but it's not clear that either of you was entirely right or justified. Maybe she showed up at the bar to renew the friendship and didn't realize you now detest her? "
446,"Break up with her. If you don't love her after a year and a half then there is no way in hell you can ask her to stick around, especially since you're long distance and she's going to be even further away while she's traveling.

You can't have your cake and eat it too. "
447,"You just described my relationship with my soon-to-be-ex-husband!!

I even told him in January I can't take it much longer, and if things didn't change, our relationship was in trouble. 

Instead of changing he created an Ashley Madison account, and when I found it and told him it was over- ""I didn't think you'd actually leave""

So you thought I'd continue being a doormat and just forget that my needs weren't being met? And forgive you for sexting all those women?

Do you know me at all? Did you listen to anything I said? WTF, I guess not!"
448,"I think the best advice would be for you to make an appointment with a nutritionist and talk to them about your diet.

I think what is happening is you have got it in your mind that its ok for you to eat whatever you want during the day, as long as you restrict yourself at night.  And you are using the bloating as an excuse.

I think what you would find is that if you prepared your daytime meals in advance, and at a little healthier than say burgers, fried chicken, loads of pasta and bread etc etc...that you'd be able to be less restrictive at night time.

but regardless, I think you would be really well served to talk to a nutritionist about your diet so you can hear it directly from the horses mouth that this may not be the healthiest way to live"

450,the tale unfolded through a series of sticky notes
451,Can confirm. My friends did this (well something similar) as a prank at one of our other friends house when we were dumb teenage boys. 
452,"Yup, some people learn by being told, others learn by fucking up.  A very defensive tween who thinks she knows it all will most likely need to learn by fucking up.  Which is fine, it is a perfectly legitimate way to learn."
453,"&gt;  What exactly are they thinking that they can do nothing and still have a thoughtful, loving relationship?

Yes. Because there are a lot of people who will keep on trying and trying and trying and trying. And we see a lot of them here in this sub, and they tell their stories and many of us (those who have walked down that path before) are all like ""DTMFA!"" and then there's the small, subset of people here who snark ""I dunno why everybody is so break-up happy here, you need to talk to him more, it sounds fixable, etc"".

I think (and have experienced) the phenomenon that if you're with someone who really does care about you and is invested in you, then when you say something is a problem, they will work on it. No, it won't get all better right away (and it may never get ""all"" better), but being with a good partner means being with someone who will care enough to try, and work on it, and make a genuine compromise. 

Anybody who won't do that is not worth trying to have a relationship with. "
454,"I would look for employment elsewhere. The managers very obviously don't give a shit about their store or their employees. I'm betting they won't make Gina do her own work because they consider it to be too much trouble, when they can much more easily ask you or Alex to do it for her. Either way, I know managers like this, and you will never be able to reach them or make them care about their jobs. Quit and watch the place fall down when the only people still there are lazy kids and managers who don't care. They deserve it."
455,"Another commenter explained how screwdrivers are used in smoking with pipes, to push the drugs through. The lighter and the screwdriver together = a drug habit, crack or meth.

"
456,"Yes, very common."
457," &gt; I'm just feeling kind of sad about it- Like I messed up or something.

Don't feel guilty about being honest about your feelings. That's a good thing!

 &gt; How do I carry on as normal and not worry about this?

By understanding (as I think you already do) that your boyfriend is moving at a slower pace with the L-word and focusing more on this:

 &gt; I feel very loved by him.

I'm sorry you feel sad, OP. It's hard not to hear the words repeated when you're so willing to say them but sometimes echoes take time to bounce back."
458,"You mean, if you had never left him, suffered through the problems that caused the breakup, trapped yourself in misery for the rest of your life, he would still be alive?

But what kind of life would *you* be leading?"
459,"Honestly it was our ""normal "" to be mistreated, it's now that we are older that we realized just how bad it was. For example when my current boyfriend asked if I like hickeys, I told him no because it used to hurt when my dad put them on me. Or the time I was reminiscing about the singers I used to love as a kid and remembering my dad showing me a nude picture of one of the singers. 

We have cut him out of our lives, but now that he is getting older he realizes that we won't be there to care for him during his old age and is now trying to be decent and reach out to us. Not going to happen. 


"
460,"And honestly, what middle schooler isn't loud and obnoxious?"
461,"""I've been helping her with the end of her degree and her post grad. She's never had to pay rent or anything.""

This is so fucked up. So because she didn't mail a rent check, you get to send flirty messages to other women? I second what an earlier poster said, this post is all about you.

She would have loved to continue the relationship, finish post grad  to repay you and build your future together, but your messages ended that.

I don't think people should beat themselves up forever but, at the very least, they should take responsibility for their mistake. 

Tldr; she doesn't owe you shit"
462,I feel I was at least on the page of compromising and would have agreed to going out every night had he presented it honestly and maybe more options but six games that involved close to 25 hours of driving time in a 8 day vacation?
463,For calling him a fat fucking ogre? Yes. 
464,"You're being tested right now, but at the same time it's an opportunity to start making moves towards being happy. Kick him out ASAP. Move-outs are stressful but even more so with a newborn."
465,Twice. Both times seem like valid reasons. They're explained in the post. 
466,"I'm really wondering what kind of advice you're looking for here, though. You know what you need to do. You need to summon all of your strength, all of your courage, and enough self esteem to just end it and not go running back to him. 

We can't help you with that sweetie. It's gotta be you. Just block him and move on. Take back the life you want."
467,"Heterochromia is pretty neat, actually. Anyone who tries insulting you over that is really reaching for something to insult you about...so, consider yourself blessed. ;)

Regarding the cursing, a simple ""Sorry, I used bad language"" should do it. You don't need to do a ritual or anything. For some people, cursing is more taboo than others. I bet you'll get a few people shrugging and rolling their eyes.

On a related, if you cuss too much, you may want to cut back. I work near a bunch of sales people, and now that I'm older, hearing them cuss every few words makes me realize how silly I sounded."
468,Again? You need to full stop stop hanging out one on one with sister's boyfriend.  You are on track to fuck up your relationship with your sister beyond repair.
469,"It'll be hard to hear, but you can also give him *solutions* to the situation. No more smoking inside + a deep clean to get the third hand smoke out, no drug users/kleptomaniacs around the kids, house and bathrooms need to be clean. Basically, your dad's house needs to be a safe place for the kids. "
470,"Yeah I was going to say she doesn't sound controlling she just sounds inconsiderate/a little rude.

Maybe OP is from the Midwest? Where I'm from speaking like that would be considered largely unacceptable but where I live now [DC] it happens all the time."
471,Do it the other way. Telling your mom first eliminates the chance of your dad getting to your mom and trying to spin some BS story before you can tell her your side. 
472,"Yeah, I feel ya. I watched my four year old brother die and it sucked. I put some of his things in a secret box and I don't talk about him. I long desperately to move far away and be somewhere no one knows, because the looks of pity suddenly bring me back. I hate seeing people who look at my family as that tragic family. I hate it and i hate wondering what they are thinking. I want to run away and start over, keep the parts of me that are me, and just eliminate that part of my life."
473,"You absolutely should not be draining savings to pay the bills. That is profoundly stupid and unfair and you need to address it immediately. Does he literally not make enough to feed you and your child or is he withholding money to use for his personal benefit? 

The typical actually-fair stay-at-home parent situation is that the working parent pays *all the bills* and still helps with childcare when they get home because the stay-at-home parent has been working all day just like they have. A fair distribution is that you both do about the same amount of total work counting both paid work and household work. Your husband is *hugely* taking advantage of you. Can you keep track of everything you're doing, with time counts (e.g. ""fed baby, 30 min; washed dishes, 1 hr; put away laundry, 45 min; changed baby, 15 min"" and so on), to demonstrate concretely to him that you're doing way, way more work than he is if he's literally only doing his 40 hours a week at his job? "
474,Please don't communicate any further with your would be rapist. This guy is a piece of shit. The ONLY reason he didn't forcibly have sex with you is because your mum came to the rescue. Please please take this very seriously.
475,The most painful response and the most truthful..
476,Ugh. I don't even know your sister and I already dislike her from your brief descriptions.
477,"Did you figure out how you let it get to that point in the first place? This woman isn't magic, if you're willing to break vows and push boundaries with one woman it'll only get easier with another. Especially when you keep your wife in the dark about it."
478,"How are you 32 years old and still think that there is any one person or relationship that will give you ""everything you want for the rest of your life"".   That's the mentality a 16 year old with their first crush. 

No, this relationship isn't going to give you everything you want for the rest of your life.  If you expect it to, do the compassionate thing and break up with her now before you marry this poor woman, and then spend the rest of your life blaming her for your dissatisfaction and boredom. 

I don't think you're grown up enough to get married.  So you probably shouldn't. "
479,"$9000/mo isn't chicken scratch.  Clearly something bad happened, and you're affected for life.  I'm guessing you lost a limb or are paralyzed in a considerable way.

*Oh, what's that, sis?  You want some of my wheelchair money so you can go run on a beach?  I wish I could run on a beach, but I can't, because I got NO FUCKIN LEG!*

I mean, you could say something like that, adapted to the injury.  Otherwise, get a CFP or other qualified person, **not related to anyone you know**, and after that, *sorry, all my income is tied up, except for the essentials.  I can't give you money out of my grocery fund.*

It's funny, you learn what you're worth to someone when you either have nothing to give, or everything.  Take away the money, do these people help you out in a time of need, or is it ""Hi, it's me, your long lost brother""?"
480,This would make a lot of sense. I'd be terrified to spill something on my friend's handmade quilt or drop a hand-painted plate.
481,"He was trying to rape you, OP. Yes he was trying to hurt you. Not to cause you pain, but to just get his dick wet. 

The moment you said no, and he kept pushing, is when he crossed the line. Dump his rapey ass."
482,"&gt; It wasn't like he was trying to hurt me or anything

That's not what it sounds like to me! What would he have done if your mom hadn't been home? This guy doesn't respect your bodily autonomy. "
483,Correct. There's no way a date was a requirement. That'd be near harassment to the employees if that was a requirement 
484,This should be the top response
485,"So this sounds like sexual harassment to me. I am so sorry. I would head over to r/legaladvice or contact a lawyer to see if there's anything you can do about this. 

If this is a large chain you could also consider contacting their corporate office. Sexual harassment is unacceptable in the workplace, I don't care if it's coming from a customer and not a coworker. 

You said it was easy to find a bartending job. If I were you I would start looking for another job with a better environment. 

Good luck."
486,[removed]
487,Great points. I will bring these up with him. Can't believe I didn't think of that.
488,"To clarify, at the start of this relationship you were 20 and she was 15?  That feels a little problematic to me, but I guess what's done is done.

I feel as if you clearly made the correct decision.  Disregarding the black magic weirdness, it seems like you had some doubts from the beginning that were never addressed."
489,"Yeah, go to the hospital. Even though they are rigid and unpleasant, the knowledge that you can just let yourself feel however you feel and still be safe is really necessary sometimes. It can protect you while you get through the worst of you suicidal feelings. Plus, you sometimes get a good hospital and then you get real counseling support and possibly a social worker to help you figure out problems like housing or medical insurance. Not always, some hospitals are shit, but even those will at least keep you safe while you cry it out. Good luck!"
490,You can't compliment someone into liking themselves. No nice words will outdo their own negative thoughts about themselves. It really is up to op to figure out what she needs to do to get over her insecurities. Repeatedly asking if he's sure he wants her in the apartment she's already moved into is a lot to deal with. 
491,I'd say you are more than 50 percent responsible for your own unhappiness be sure you seem to be incapable of communicating or attempting to communicate with your husband. You are keeping it all inside until it's too much and you're either going to explode or leave him.  That's not really a marriage. 
492,"Yeah, I think maybe your personality may be a little in play here.  I'm guessing you aren't the happy-go-lucky type?"
493,"&gt;They've been dating for 2 months and I don't feel comfortable with it

You don't have to feel comfortable with anything he does. He's not dating you. He is dating someone else. That persons comfort comes first- not yours. 

If you aren't comfortable, find a new friend. 

&gt;it makes me really jealous, I hate her and I think he shouldn't be in a relationship with her

Do you just have zero emotional depth? If you are jealous, leave the situation and leave him (and her!) alone! It doesn't matter who you want him to date. It matters who he wants to date, and that is his girlfriend- not you.

&gt;What can I do to try to get him to break up with her, and maybe even to date me?

Nothing. It's disrespectful, immature, childish and just plain hateful to ruin someone's relationship out of petty jealously. 

&gt;I don't want to seem like I am just trying to ruin his relationship but I think he should have asked me about it before he started dating her

No. No friend has to ask their friend permission to date someone. That's disturbing that you even think that is how a friendship operates.

You need to back the hell off and get out of this guy's life. You are trying to wreck his relationship and make his life hell because you have the delusional belief that he belongs to you. "
494,"Well for one thing I would make sure that my arguments in this situation are 100% things that can be backed up and make logical sense.

Every time you bring up something that isn't actually much/any additional risk (like Zika), it makes it sound like you don't have many or any legitimate reasons to want to keep your son away from her family. I have literally no knowledge of the crime aspect. But continuing to play up stuff like Zika and Dengue, which you can get anywhere in Brazil, makes you sound like you're grasping at straws."
495,"I don't know, it's up to you what's worth breaking up over, not up to me, since this isn't my relationship.

If I was in your shoes, I would probably break up with him over the fact that he LIED versus the fact that he had naked chick on his phone. He could've gotten those images from anywhere, maybe not even for her, but the fact that he lied is much more damaging in the relationship.

And who knows, the fact that he MIGHT have been receiving nudes from another girl is bad enough."
496,"Let her know that you'll be there for her when/if she needs help getting away from him. but that you will never deal with him ever.

... or... let her know that if it's true."
497," If he cares about your opinion, why doesn't he respect your opinion on the matter of wanting to not be abused? You're  talking in circles because you're explaining * his justifications for abusing you*. I'd  put money on the table that I care more about your safety and well-being than he does. There is no justification for abusing another person, especially a loved one. 

I grew up with anger issues. Let me tell you - If I lived your life by your husband's excuses, I probably would have murdered half my family and all the women I've dated. I actually have an abusive past, OP. I was verbally and emotionally abusive. It was always the worst thing I could have done. I can't imagine also being physically abusive - talk about completing the nightmare. The difference is... I wanted to stop and worked on changing my behavior. I didn't try to rationalize my abused, I didn't defend my actions by blaming my partners behaviors, I didn't attempt to paint my behavior as a form of justice. I admitted that I was the problem, understood that my own misfortune was the result of me hurting those closest to me, and accepted that the only way to make those things better was to change myself as a person. Your husband is taking none of the blame and that is one of the biggest red flags here. 

He is 32. He is not a child, he knows very much what he is doing. The older we get, the harder it is to change. Honestly, truly, his lack of responsibility at this age is scary. Be careful, be safe, ask yourself if your patience comes at the cost of your self-respect, and take no shame if you do something for yourself. If you ask me, Your husband isn't thinking about your needs here, and he doesn't show promise to change that any time soon, if at all. If he can't start taking an immediate U-turn here, I encourage you to not wait long. You only get so much time on this Earth, and he has had plenty of opportunity to change already. "
498,Is the box in your name? You should be able to work with the bank to get access by providing proper ID if it's in your name
499,"As you get older, you'll keep seeing this happen. People placing blame where it doesn't  belong. You didn't do anything wrong. You know this and they know this but they're blaming you anyways because they're morons. Your father messed up badly and you paid the price. You need to worry about getting better. There is nothing you can do about your father's side of the family. They're making the wrong choice. Get better soon."
500,"If it's any consolation, you might not consider it creative but it did bring a smile on my face when I read it. It's like... no one ever thinks about the hat. It's nice to know someone thought about that hat."
501,Nah I can totally get behind that. Imagine living with someone who keeps his own space like others might keep a dumping ground.
502,Does he feel guilty for having a crush on someone else then? I didn't think so. 
503,"You got rough and physical with her. Stop defending it. Someone gets in a car drunk they may not *intend* to plow down an innocent person. But they chose to reckless and dangerous.  That's not an accident, it a direct effect from  selfish and bad choices"
504,"&gt;  I'm sort of locked in.

You *always* have a choice.

Don't fall for the ""sunk cost fallacy"". Just because deposits were made and stuff was purchased doesn't mean you *have* to follow through. That money is gone either way, but you can still take charge of your time and your mental health."
505,Wow. Just reading this I would have kicked your parents out already. 
506,[removed]
507,"I would tell him what you told us. I'd let him know everything. Be completely honest with your dad (as long as he isn't abusive, as one of the other comments said) and I think he will be a little upset that you lied to him, but will really respect that you told him the truth before things got out of hand. Apologize for being dishonest and just tell him everything. I'm sure he will help you sort things out."
508,"&gt; Yeah, it will probably break me, but that's life. 

Wait, what?? No! Signing up for something that will hurt you - possibly ""break"" you - isn't just ""life."" Life is not supposed to be pain (certainly not all or even most of the time, anyway), and _volunteering_ for pain is ... in a way, anti-life. Anti-_your_-life. 

There's a great saying on this sub: don't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. In this case, he's not expecting or even asking you to keep him warm, but you're all ready with the match and gasoline. Please don't do that to yourself!"
509,Good thing he didn't delete Tinder then
510,Honestly I think you need to prioritize what is truly important to you and your life. Realize that the vacuum being left out isn't the end of the world but losing the person you love might be. 
511,I haven't seen the actual marks but I know quite a bit about forensic and it sounds very much like the marks one your mum are defensive marks. You wife was attacked. You need to call the police and have a protective order against your mum.
512,You're going no contact... you don't need to say anything.
513,"So, being in a relationship is about doing things you really don't enjoy sometimes because it makes your partner happy. Does my SO *want* to go to botanical gardens? Heeeeeeck no. Does my SO like going to visit my parents at the camp ground they stay at during the summer? Another resounding no. Do I like hanging out with his brother and his brother's girlfriend on random weekends with little or no notice? I'd rather have a hot stake driven into both eyes.

BUT my SO does things that make me happy and I do things that make him happy. You do things for your SO that inconvenience/bore/annoy you sometimes because it's important to them.

FIVE MONTHS is a long time of not giving a shit about something that you expressed was very important to you. I find that very, very offensive and hurtful. 

This is a red flag, not necessarily a relationship ending one but if this is a pattern of chronic ignorance and refusal to meet at least part way, I'd start to take a more third-party perspective on the relationship. "
514,"Have you tried being a grown ass man?

'Cause you're a bit old not to be one by now.  

And good god almighty, are you really actually concerned about the relationship between your wife and parents?! 

You told your wife to trust you and she ended up assaulted in her own home. She's been taking abuse for you for years and you don't even have the balls to get your dad out of your home. 

The only relationship you should be worried about is the one between you and your wife, where you try to make up for the hell you have put her through and be greatful as all hell she stayed, because you don't deserve it. 

Why the heck would your wife want a relationship with people that attack her, invade her space, and ignore her boundries? What kind of loving husband would want their wife to be around people like that?   "
515,"You're totally assuming ""not allowed"" because it fits your narrative. She just cares more about her bf than you. She simply didn't want to. "
516,"Achievements aren't everything. Once you get out of high school, you will see how important the soft skills they are not helping you with like emotional intelligence are. You really need to work on building that up as early as possible because it will only get harder as you get older. Defining yourself by external accomplishments is a great way to fall into deep depression the first time you are in a situation when those aren't possible. "
517,"I was with you until you said you deleted her pictures without telling her. Thats not good, and two, it kind of makes grandma a little less crazy. I mean, didnt delete those pictures, but they are gone, and you were deleting something....So grandmas not all nuts."
518,"Yeah - the dog issue sounds entirely normal from all parties which is why I didn't specifically comment on it.  

The occasional bark is normal.  A dog barking a bit excessively in a new environment is normal.  The  property management stating how long they have to get the dog under control is also normal, and IMO 2 weeks seems fair considering the nature of dogs.  Since they attach to people rather than places, once the pup realizes their owners aren't going anywhere, they should calm down significantly."
519,"This is HER home, not your mom's. Not wanting clutter you hate in YOUR home is pretty reasonable. "
520,"That's part of living in an apartment. If you don't want to see, hear, or smell others - don't live an apartment. That's what those of us that can't tolerate shared spaces like that do.

Even living in a house, you get exposed to smells from neighbors. Are you going to complain about that as well. ""Your BBQ smell is drifting onto my property. Please reverse the winds or stop cooking.""

"
521,OP is going for the gold in mental gymnastics trying to avoid the problem.
522,"It is not abusive behavior.  If it means anything, I have a Masters in psychology with a focus on marriage and relationship therapy.  It is not abusive.  What a good friend would do in this situation is listen to what their friend needs, and in this case the friend said she needs distance from you."
523,"WTF, I thought the question was just gonna be about inviting her, period. Ditching your girlfriend as your date to do so is a whole 'nother level. Your ""friend"" (which if she feels remotely okay with this idea, has no ""friend"" thoughts in her head) needs to either find someone else to go with, get herself an invite as a singleton, or arrange to meet the people she wants to see another time. She declined the original invite, she'll survive the consequences of that just fine without you coming to the ""rescue."" "
524,"Right? Like, it's one thing if you say you're not good with children, or don't want children, but wtf is with people saying they hate *all of humanity* for the first 18 years of their lives. "
525,"I think you know more than enough now to back slowly away from this woman, making no sudden moves...."
526,"The problem with this story is that the neighbor has no reason to call you. Even if he did know about the sade why would he think your husband opening it is strange? And even if the ""strange"" thing is your husband watching cartoons with a teddy bear surely it's even stranger for your neighbor to have been in a position to notice that. And that's saying nothing about the strangeness of your neighbor feeling like this is something worth calling you about.

No person in this story behaves like a believable human. Try again."

Lying to get away with doing what you want isn't the solution. Don't make promises you can't keep and be a victim when you face consequences. "
533,"Trusting her isn't the only issue here. It's pretty clear that you're just not happy. As you mentioned, you feel like it's a one-man show. 

I can only tell you how I'd be in this type of situation and full disclosure, I haven't been, nor do I have a child to also take into consideration.  

First I'd ask myself; is this what I want? Do I want to work with my wife, do we want to work together knowing it's going to be a huge challenge, to see if we can still be together? Do I want to communicate how unhappy I've been and how I feel like I'm doing everything alone? And can I commit to putting in that genuine effort of moving forward, if she's able and willing to as well?

Or do I want to consider an alternative? Do I want to give her the time to navigate the loss she's just had, give her that time to grieve and process and also to think about what she wants for herself and our relationship, and then go from there? 

Do I want to just focus on my son, myself and our lives? 

It's a lot of questions, I know, which isn't necessarily helpful and I apologise if it's too much at the moment. Just wanted to put these out there for your consideration. Ultimately, you're absolutely between a rock and a hard place right now and need to put yourself, and your son, first. Take the time you need to let the dust settle, just keep the peace at home while you start to put the pieces together. Take kiddo out for ice cream, or to the park and have fun, which I know is easier said than done, I just mean try and let yourself have an hour or two with your son without stressing about what's going on if you can. 

Then regroup, do what *you* feel is best for you, be that working on this relationship or other options. My thoughts are with you, once again sorry to have written such a lengthy reply. "
534,"Oh my gosh, thanks for the correction! The advice makes 10000% more sense when one can actually read. :)"
535,"I don't know if you said this to your son already but tell him ""hey I want you to know that I love you very deeply and I am here for you no matter what"". And then demonstrate that you are there. Listen to what he says. Try and bond with him as a person not just as your son. And don't be afraid to say to him ""you seem very unhappy lately. I notice you behaving in XYZ ways. I am worried for you and I want to make things easier for you. Let me know if there's anything I can do"" and have a number for a therapist in your back pocket for when he'll ask for it. "
536,"I swear to God this has to be a troll post, right? I'm convinced. "
537,"Then you cant keep your financial situation and the settlement a secret.

"" Yes, my family is validly upset and confused. I dont trust them and I didnt tell them about my medical settlement to cover the $20,000/whatever amount on medical bills and that we had leftover to spend. So naturally, they think there is more that we are hiding from them.""

""But, OP, why not just tell them this?""

""I am only telling you because you are a close friend, so I need your discretion on this. Sister has a drug problem and I CANNOT let her know about my money""

The truth will set you free."
538,"And it was meant to be your pay for caring for her, like a salary. She's not been treating it like it was pay to do a job. It's like your boss fired you, but insists you come in and do work without pay, while he's paying someone else who won't work. Keep doing the work for free and no one is motivated to fix it."
539,"He might think it's an American thing if he's surrounded by other academic types. He's right that 1.5 years would be considered a quick engagement by most Americans, and though he's wrong that most Americans *in general* would consider 4-5 years of dating a typical timeline in your 30s, it is definitely typical among American *academics*. My husband and I only just got married after like 7 years together, and we're both American academics. (Just FYI, so you don't think he was completely making this up.)"
540,"I only have the one entrance. 

And I did consider that it missed her because the motion detection isn't the best but it has, historically, always worked if you get up close to the door. Even if it missed her coming in it should of caught her going out "
541,It's the best POSSIBLE thing to do!
542,I hope things *are* over. She deserves better.
543,"OP, here are the things that stood out to me in this thread.

&gt; He is excellent at his job and does extremely well.

&gt;When left to his own devices, he would only gather things that he himself wanted to keep/thought worthy of keeping.

&gt;Then, halfway through he started trying to get up to do something else.

Maybe he has ADD and maybe he doesn't.   Regardless, it should be 100% on him to take care of it.  You should not remind him or push him.  If he hasn't made progress in 1 week then you should move forward on plans to dump him.

The three statement above make it pretty clear that if something is important to him then he'll pay attention to it.  If he's not paying attention then he just doesn't care and at this point it sounds like he doesn't care enough about his relationship with you to pay attention to it.  The fact that you have told him you are at the end of your rope and he couldn't take the time to read through the entire thread should give you a very clear message that he doesn't care.  He doesn't believe you will leave him so he can just keep on being lazy with you and let you handle the fall out.  
"
544,"I think this feels like a breakup to you because it *was* a breakup.  Even though you asked that the two of you take a ""break,"" him moving out and blocking you on FB are pretty good signs that he's peaced out entirely.

Also, just wanna say really quick that this isn't an Indian vs. American thing - not all Americans want to wait 4-5+ years to get married.  This guy just doesn't want marriage.  He *wants* to want it, because it's what usually happens in serious relationships and because his friends are getting married, but it's not something he truly desires.

I honestly don't think you should try to get him back.  You say now that being with him is more important than having a timeline for marriage, but you're only thinking that because y'all just broke up and you feel sad, lonely, and hurt.  If you got back together, having no plans for the future would still bother you.  This isn't going to go away.  And it's not unreasonable or controlling to want to have a timeline for marriage, it's very typical, so I wouldn't be looking for /r/relationships to try and talk you out of that.

I think you need to date someone who actually has time for you and wants the same things you do.  Those guys are out there.  Give yourself some time to heal and then get back out there on online dating or something."
545,"Okay, this sounds like an unbearable situation and it affects everyone. Perhaps it's time for some tough love. Tell her that while you love her, you can no longer continue this way.  Honestly? You have to prioritize your children at some point. You have prioritized your wife, at great emotional and financial cost, far too long. "
546,It makes me feel a little embarrassed but excellent point.
547,"My understanding was that she could have done this in each suit. I feel like op may be too soft on her ex, or maybe didn't get the best lawyer. I feel like the second suit, they should have been able to rake ex over the coals. 

Ianal,  though."
548,Was looking to see if anyone noticed this. I definitely remember reading this before. 
549,"I'm not sure if she can afford a lawyer. She makes $13/hr in Ontario, Canada while my dad makes $80k a year."
550,"I'd rather them be open about themselves and not use another person for their own benefit. It's hard. I get it. But just because he's gay doesn't mean he gets a free pass. He's a shitty person who happens to be gay and used another person for breeding purposes, and when he didn't get his way, he gets a clean cut and all of the moral support because he came out, completely invalidating his exwife's feelings. "
551,"If he's in that much debt, he's not getting a clearance, with or without you.  Tell him not to list you and move on."
552,[deleted]
553,"You're having a break for a couple of days. Take the opportunity to make it a permanent one - his reply to you isn't an apology, it's sly and self-justifying. If you make 'unnecessary comments to your loved one', the appropriate response is for the loved one to make some comments back to you - not to crush your hand.

You've already learned something, he hasn't and never will, I suspect."
554,So you are afraid to tell that Adam is a disloyal and shitty person because he's going be a shitty person? 
555,"You have every right to feel betrayed and hell i'd be fucking furious if my mum was cheating and acting like that when my dad was in a time of need.

Your dad is the better person here, as soon as shit went down he left and did the right thing rather than trying to keep a failed family unit together.

Also what kind of fucking friends are they if they don't bat an eye at this shit? I'd cut my friend off for life if i found out shit like this from them.

As for now? go live with your dad, confront your mum that you know why and that the damage is done. She deserves to lose you both for what shes done."
556,"I read that line as OP conveying the way the friend talked about her, not how OP thinks of other people with weight issues. "
557,"I'd think a good person would at least feel bad about it though, and not cheat while their husband is recovering from surgery and illness."
558,How far away from you does it need to be that you'd want to still hang out with that person?  It's like a muslim hanging out with a guy who posts about hating other muslims but thinking somehow you're immune.  The whole attitude is poison.
559,Especially if you have loans and wedding money and visas and a husband back home sending you cash so you can ride out the year.
560,"I'll bet you $200 that she doesn't meet a new dude in Spain and never come home. It sucks that you'll lose the bet, but you'll need the money."

563,"A year is actually not that long of an engagement. That's just how long it takes to plan a wedding in a lot of major metropolitan areas. If you want anything even resembling a traditional wedding, venues book out that far in advance. "
564,"If she respected OP, she would have confessed her feelings to her and not to OP's boyfriend. The reason she told the boyfriend first is because she thought she had a chance."
565,"If my wife *EVER* told a 16 year old to fuck off, or any variant of that, I would pack my bags and leave her sorry ass.

Matthew is going to have TERRIBLE life long baggage. Not only because of his own fuck up parents, but because of your wife.

What an abusive piece of shit.

I know you want to 'explain' to her that this was 'wrong', but some actions speak louder than words; and inaction on your part is complicity."

Your wife needs medical help. You need to help her get it."
571,"Well, I do 95% of the cooking, meal planning, and grocery shopping in my relationship, but my husband does 100% of the dishes and 90% of the laundry. It works when nobody is Cinderella for everything. "
572,"&gt;It seems like it's some kind of defense mechanism where I see myself as a morally good person who wouldn't do hurtful things, so when she tells me something I'm doing is hurtful to her I'm just like ""well actually no, it has nothing to do with you!"" 

Dude, you don't get to define what is hurtful *to her.* 

Its understandable that you would be defensive a bit when you hear that you are doing something wrong, but to flat out deny that her feelings are legitimate is something else entirely. You seem to lack empathy. Are you an only child? Is this your first relationship?

You need to retrain your mind to give her feelings legitimacy whether you understand them, or not."
573,I would even wait til he fills this notebook to see if it disappears and is replaced with a new one. That way it can't be described away as a new habit of it's really just the most recent notebook implicating him in a very old habit. 
574,"Life isn't static. You had less money back then, which makes the situations impossible to compare.

However, you should discuss this with your SO. But whether or not you help our your sister shouldn't be based upon your financial situation 8 year ago, that doesn't make any sense. "
575,"Make sure you write a break up letter to him in crayon, and don't use joined up writing."
576,"You and your boyfriend want different things from a relationship. You want a partner with emotional as well as physical intimacy. Someone you share your feelings with and support each other in times of need. He wants a fuck-buddy with physical but not emotional companionship. 

He doesn't care about your feelings. He could not be more clear about this. They are not his problem and he doesn't want to be bothered with them. This is not some minor issue you can work through or make him understand. 99% of woman would consider this a deal breaker. If you are looking for anything deeper then sex you need to move on. If you are happy to have casual sex with him and not expect any emotional support or friendship (friends would listen to you) then keep it up. But don't hope for more you will only be disappointed."
577,"&gt;The secret had nothing to do with my wife

The secret concerned the wellbeing of her close friend, of course it involved your wife."
578,"I'm bisexual and I'm a woman, so it's a little more accepted, but I still have a hard time explaining it to SOs. Many of them act like the OP did, I had a guy break up with me because he was afraid I'd leave him for a woman first chance I got. Dating women is even harder- an ex of mine told everyone I ""left her for a man"" despite the fact we were broken up and I was single for A YEAR before I dated (yes, a man) again.

The way I look at it is this- most guys like several types of women. My husband has two ""types""- Caucasian curvy brunettes and very thin Afro-Latinas (I'm the first one). I can generally pick out exactly which women he'll find attractive with almost 100% accuracy and his past dating history is comically predictable . But just because he's married to a curvy white brunette doesn't mean he's also looking around to leave me at any moment for a skinny biracial girl. He just happens to like both. And as I explained to him, I'm the same, but my categories are gender instead of build or race. "
579,"Oh my god, is is it you? Are you the dirtbag and you're trying to defend yourself??"
580,"I agree with this. Her indecision points to a depressive episode. When I am in that phase I feel bored and even the most exciting suggestions do absolutely nothing for me and I have an excuse for everything suggested. This is how I know it's time to seek help. I see the signs as they start coming in. Have been dealing with it for 20 years now so I am incredibly grateful that I can see it happening now and do something before I get ""too far gone"" 


She's obviously not at that stage yet, but most people do get there because they don't want to feel like nothing, like the only way I can describe it is ""what's the point, I'm just going to die anyway"" which is a very very bad place to get to as its hard to get out. So she needs to learn to read her signs before she gets to that point so she can take action while still motivated to do so. 

This sounds horrible, but sometimes the only way to get them to get help without hitting rock bottom is to manipulate them into doing it, asking them to do it for you because you are worried and it's causing YOU horrific anxiety, you see most depressed people don't care about fucking themselves over but they do tend to still care about others. She needs help, fast and before she hits rock bottom because her rock bottom might be too rock rather than soil for OP to dig out of himself. "
581,"You can tell a lot about a person by how they treat those below them, and if she can't even give a dog water or clean up his poop then she's not that great of a person. Please, PLEASE find that dog another home. He does not deserve to live like that. The dog's health and safety is more important than your roommate feeling like a good dog owner."
582,"This is not schizophrenia. It sounds more like a fugue state or psychogenic amnesia if he does not have any physical trauma. Not actually trying to diagnose him though, just want to make clear that these symptoms do not represent a typical (or even non typical) case of schizophrenia at all. "

584,"He's never done it before. I didn't even know he had a ""fur suit"". Aside from this, he is a very intelligient, mild-mannered kid. "
585,"This is not a troll post. I can't prove it without revealing personal info, so I suppose you'll have to take my word. 

He's not on drugs, never been resentful towards me at all. His friends are a polite group, they know he is a ""furry"" but they do not share his beliefs. I've met a few of their parents, nothing about his social life makes me think he's being influenced by them. I honestly don't know where this ""furry"" thing came from, but I've been okay about it till now."

587,Doesn't matter if he's cheating. That's just icing on the cake. He's already not being a good partner or a good parent. Two perfectly valid reasons for her to divorce him.

590,"I was raised by my mom and two sisters. I've been living with my girlfriend for 4 years and I'm cleaner and more hygienic than all of them lol. 

Not saying all men are dirtier or cleaner, what I'm really saying is if I were you I would sit him down and basically tell him ""You have dandruff, buy some head and shoulders. You have gunk in your teeth, brush and use mouthwash. Cover your dirty asshole with a clean pair of underwear every 24 hours. Be an adult."""
591,"Mine too - it says a lot when the ""best case scenario"" is as bad as this. Poor OP, I really feel bad for her."
592,"You cheated on your bf and instead of cutting the housemate out of your life or atleast reducing contact with him, you decided to spend even more time with him. Then when you realized you had feelings for HM, instead of trying to get over it, you decided to confess. Hell, if he knew what you were up to behind his back, he really shouldn't give a shit about you."
593,OP pls update when you have a chance. I'm so sorry you had to go through this it's awful. At least you know you have this community here for you!
594,"The difference is you didn't intentionally let the cat loose, and then do the exact opposite of everything your girlfriend asked to find the cat. "
595,"Your WIFE was the one who made a decision to ruin her life. Anything could have happened when she got behind the wheel. You were trying to get her to make better decisions.

Your wife acted like a flat-out piece of shit and she needs to grovel for your forgiveness and maybe even think about going to a program for people who abuse alcohol.

If your wife won't fully apologize and take ownership of this situation, you need to re-evaluate the relationship. I personally could NEVER be with somebody that irresponsible."
596,"Ten years ago, I was an actively drinking alcoholic with untreated bipolar disorder. I was not nice and not pleasant to be around. (Admittedly not abusive)

In ten years, I've stopped drinking and through therapy and medication, reached stability. I do not associate with the people that I was friends with ten years ago. While I've given my fiance a quick summary of those years, I hope he never meets any of my old friends, because they don't know the current me, and don't represent who I am now. I bet a few of them are holding onto anger. At this point, I'm not going to dig it back up and apologize.

If, in three years, your bf has proven himself to be kind, trustworthy, and he makes you feel safe, delete her message. Have a solid conversation with him, and if you feel like you can stay in the relationship, then let his ex stay in the past."
597,"I'm betting your StepFather lied about the whole thing and just wanted an excuse to get rid of your brother and thus you and your sister too. Notice the pattern? Only his side gets to be there, look at my wife's kids they are all awful yada yada yada. Edit: The cover photot is exactly that, a COVER. It couldn't be meeee, I love all my step kids. Yeah, OP you really need to check out JUSTNOFIL or JUSTNOMIL, that manipulative behavior is classic triangulation tactics. Blaming someone else for kicking out your brother when it was really StepFather. "
598,"She is only 2, so unlikely she would even be able to tell you that something bad happened to her. You owe it to her to listen to your instincts, even if that damages the relationship with MIL. "
599,"Yeah, I thought so. I could give you details about her that might paint a clearer picture of who she is/why she acts like this... but it would come off as catty I'm sure. "

613,"I think that since you only get 2 hours a day with her during the week, minimizing your hobby time on the weekends is probably a good idea. Right now you're working most of the baby's awake time, which you need to do! Taking such a huge chunk of prime baby time, which you don't get a lot of, doesn't make sense in the first year of the baby's life. 

Could you shorten the hobby time on the weekend to 2 hours, or change it to 4 hours when the baby is asleep? "
614,"&gt;""If it takes that much effort I don't know why those people are still together. If you're meant to be together it should just be easy.""

Wow.


What's the longest relationship she's ever had?"
615,Kind of between a rock and a hard place. In order to leave I have to be financially stable. In order for me to be financially stable I have to stop paying my husband's debts... but to do that they need to get paid off. So I'm basically stuck helping this man until I'm financially able to help myself so I can leave. :/
616,"I'm reading all the comments and shaking my head at how little respect this guy has for you. This is the one that made me pop open the reply box. Please read the words you've typed here for us. Look at what he's really saying to you. 

Get out of this relationship, and find someone who gives a shit about you.  "
617,"You came on to him plenty of times when he didn't want to, without his consent. That is predatory. You're only thinking about yourself. Do you even give a shit about what he wants at all?"
618,"I agree.

Honestly, I've been in toxic relationships like this before and thought I was genuinely past allowing these things to happen after YEARS of therapy.
I'm embarrassed to face others and angry at myself for all of this."
619,"Is your boyfriend 10 years old?  I would absolutely dump someone if they lost my pet while ""playing"" in an irresponsible and avoidable way.  I don't see how your reaction was inappropriate at all."
620,"I think that whatever your budget is, whether you shop at thrift stores, supermarkets or buy designer clothes - it's still cheaper for a man to outfit himself then it is for a women. 

Not for one moment have I suggested that she carry on spending the way that she is, as clearly this isn't working for them. 

What I was suggesting to OP was that he has to be realistic when setting a budget for their clothing, that it's not possible for it to be a 50/50 split between them. "
621,"OP please please read this. Watch your food and drinks with him. This is exactly how it started with my sister's ex husband. He would do things to her when she slept and when she figured it out he started drugging her. Get out ASAP but if you can't or won't then at least be mindful that these things usually escalate. His reaction wasn't remorse, he doesn't want this to stop. 

My sister didn't leave right away (I'm not blaming her at all, it wasn't her fault) and it escalated to the point that he killed her dog, drugged her, raped her, locked her in a room with the rotting body of the dog, and nearly killed her when she escaped. And that's not even half of all the horrible things she went through with him. Don't stay. Please don't stay. A shelter is better than this. "

626,"no, that is also creepy. chat her up the next time you run into each other. sending her a electronic message before you're properly introduced is just going to be weird no matter what."
627,"Honestly, your wife deserves to be with someone who loves her/ is attracted to her as well. It's not about you, it's about her as well."
628,"You start dating by asking someone out. It's that simple. It may not be easy, but it is simple.  
You can also ask your friends to try to set you up with someone; plenty of people love playing matchmaker.

Finally, do not become friends with someone you want to be romantically involved with. It's not a good situation for either of you. You'll spend all your time pining and they'll feel like the friendship was under false pretenses. And they'll be right.  

If you're romantically interested in someone, ask them out. If they decline, consider whether you can be actual friends with them knowing that you will absolutely never date. If you find yourself hoping that you'll date someday, that answer is no.

Finally, nobody gives a shit about your sexual experiences or lack thereof. You don't ever have to bring it up if you don't want to. Most people (both genders) in their 20s are terrible at sex, so nobody will notice if you don't tell them.

Edit: PS Attitude check: She didn't friendzone you, you friendzoned yourself. You're the one who's romantically interested in her, you're entirely responsible for your pining if you stay friends with her."
629,I know he's trying to be cutesie but it comes across as whiny. 
630,"Girl. Tell him to call you when he's legally separated and living apart from his wife, at a minimum. In the meantime, no texting, no getting drunk together. 

Otherwise, you're the rebound at best. Or the side piece."
631,"Do you think you're ready to tell him what you just told us? Because I figure that should do the trick. 

Not that you'd need to go into that kind of detail regarding your trauma. But I think you should tell him that you went through some traumatizing experiences and what you'd want him to keep in mind for that reason."
632,"Most of the time you are right. However I have had standoffs with racoons who were not afraid of me at all (one that snuck into my house to eat my cat's food; one that was with her 2 kits). It's not worth provoking them that's for sure, especially when they're next to a food source. "
633,"How do you even reach that conclusion without knowing his views on birth control?  Maybe he trapped her, I've heard of men microwaving birth control pills before.  We don't know how either of them feel about contraception, maybe he is just dumb and hates to wear a condom."
634,"Almost all university professors and staff have a blanket response they use that says something along the lines of ""I have received your email but due to privacy laws and the University's code of ethics, I'm unable to share any information about student X. Please contact said student if you wish to discuss this issue with them. Have a nice day."" Some may add on that there's nothing they can do to help and suggest the student visit them in their office during office hours. "
635,"It's because it's simple to suggest the idea of adoption without providing any information on what the experience would be like, resources, or even just logistics. They get to lazily throw it out there as an option from their moral high ground. They get to walk away and feel like they did something good by suggesting the woman gives a chance at life to an embryo, without any consideration for the mother's emotional and physical health throughout the entire following year of pregnancy and recovery, meanwhile their suggestion is just complicating the emotional battle the woman is already facing. 

Heck, I'm just a senior in college, so if I were to get pregnant tomorrow, it would probably be logistically simpler for me to take time off than most women. I can easily take a leave of absence from university and I'm only 21 so I'm still on my parents' health insurance. I don't have real world responsibilities yet, and i still feel like it would turn my world upside-down right now to carry a pregnancy to term and then get no opportunity to bond with the baby at the end of it. (Edit: typo) "
636,"Of course not, but you said

638,That's so true! All my relationships in my 20s taught me exactly what I *don't* want in a relationship!
639,"""Imported Chinese""? Doesn't sound like you're even referring to a human being. "
640,"Why would you chase after someone who has told you he's not interested in a relationship with you? He dumped you and picked up with someone else very quickly. He was either not really invested in the relationship or he already had someone else on the back burner. He also sounds very controlling. Who tells another person how many clothes they should have? 

You were together for 3 years; that's a long time. But you've made a lot of progress in your own life. 1 year is really not that long...keep doing what you're doing in terms of improving your life. But also keep up the therapy. You seem fixated on a person who treated you badly - there's something in your thinking about him that you need to adjust and make a habit, like going to the gym."
641,"With regards to the swimming thing, you may want to (within reason) give her less choice about what she does. Just take her from one planned thing to the next - if she's feeling nervous and alone then her instinct may be to curl up in a ball and shut everything down. In which case it's better to lead than to ask.

You also want to talk to her sister. It doesn't mattet what your sister is used to doing, she invited this person and is letting her down as a gust, making what should be an enjoyable adventure into a nervous depressing nightmare. It's cruel, inconsiderate, and irresponsible. Tell her to get her shit together.  There's a real person with real feelings here, your sister can't just decide this wasn't as fun as she had hoped and back out of this now. She needs to grow up and take responsibility.

As for things to do - take her to a Chonese restaurant (it can be weird to see how her cuisine is differently represented, but also a taste of home can help if she's homesick and culture-shocked), watch a show you know she watches already (likely to be something like Big Bang Theory, Sherlock, or Friends, but talk to her and see what she likes - one of her anime shows, maybe?), play a game with a few minimal interactions that is easy to teach (Settlers of Catan has Chinese language rules online, Werewolf is quite popular in China so she may know it, or even more basic card games - or heck, play Mahjong), go shopping in malls for souvenirs and whatever else. "
642,"She doesn't have to gloat. 

Her boufriend is a bad teammate. He's refusing to take responsibility so letting her struggle with the whole load. 

This relationship is in a death spiral as it is. She's tried talking. He says he'll do better then doesn't. 

At some point she needs to stop picking up his slack. 

This is a freaking theater show. Not a big deal. She isn't letting him get fired or lose out on money or whatever. 

It is perfectly fair for her to say ""You hadn't decided on tickets. I didn't want to miss out over your indecision, so I got my own. You said you would take care of the tickets, so I trusted you to get your own.""


"
643,"First off, I am 100% pro choice. That means I support a woman's decision to choose, whether that's abortion, adoption, or having the baby. And I've been through the first and third options myself.

&amp;nbsp;

I had an abortion at 18 and while it was incredibly painful emotionally, I never doubted that it was the right choice. I had been homeless until that month and was terrified of being homeless again plus I was only eating when I was at work because I got comped meals... How could I bring a child into that? I was also completely unequipped to be a parent. But the biggest thing was my abusive ex had knocked me up and I knew that if I had that child he would use that as leverage to abuse and terrorize me for the next 18 years. And he would damage that child too. So  had the abortion.

&amp;nbsp;

In early 2014, I got pregnant again. The first time I got pregnant my abusive ex had actually purposely gotten me pregnant which just makes me sick to my stomach thinking about it. But this time it was just a complete accident. I was on birth control and I shouldn't have been able to get pregnant anyway, I was fresh out of rehab and hadn't had a period in 2+ years. Having an abortion was never an option, I just knew I couldn't go through with it and if I did it would drive me to relapse and I probably wouldn't survive long enough to get a second chance. So I had the baby and I've never looked back. My son is such a blessing.

&amp;nbsp;

The point I'm trying to make is if abortion is the right choice, then do it. But don't have one if you actually want the baby you're just worried about timing. The truth is, it's  NEVER the perfect time. But if you want this baby you can and will make it work. I'm a single mom with no financial help from family and I figured it out."
644,"Some disfigurements/tics/scars/whatever, in fact a lot of them, come from trauma. There's no reason to ask about this even if maybe it's not a big deal, it's better to not just casually bring it up when it has a pretty good chance of being harmful. "
645,I'm so glad that I now understand this reference! 
646,"I'm 27 and from the south and this is horrifying for someone my age, he's a creep and they're being creepy too."
647,"&gt; after trying and failing to have a baby for over a year, 

No one mentioned this. Did you guys both get checked up with a fertility doctor? 1 year is pretty much the starting point of when people will start examining thoroughly for fertility issues.."
648,"I agree with the others. Who Yaz wants to spend time with is her own business, if her bf wants to complain she's hanging out with Greg, so be it. Yaz is innocent (bad word choice?) is what people here are trying to say, don't blame her for the fact that Greg is attracted to her.

The problem is Greg. He wants to hook up with a 21 year old, and he clearly sees you as someone not worth his time compared to Yaz. It makes you uncomfortable, she's too young for him, and he spends all his time talking about her. If she was single, he'd probably choose her over you anytime.

This is on him, and maybe you should think about wether you want this relationship to continue.

TL;DR: THE PROBLEM IS NOT YAZ, IT IS GREG. "
649,"This would make my life a lot sadder. I like having food and doing fun activities outside the house with the people I have sex with, even if we aren't romantic or committed and never will be."
650,"Well yeah, lots of people that fuck casually end up dating. Just like lots of people that are friends end up dating. Doesn't make orbiting a good idea"
651,"At -10 and -11 I was told that as long as my eye sight stabilized for 2 years,  I could get LAZIK..."
652,"Here's what you say:

Bro - what your wife is asking is bananas.  I will not be blind for the whole day so that every candid photo is perfect.  Not to mention, id like to actually *see* you get married, not just hear it while I see giant blobs.  If she's not ok with me wearing my glasses, then I cannot remain in the wedding party. 

If he pushes back, you continue with:

If I needed a leg brace, would it be reasonable for her to expect me to go without it and be in severe pain?  What about hearing aids?  A wheelchair?  My glasses are not a fashion accessory. They are the way I can see.

Note - I have extremely poor eyesight. My contacts undercorrect my eyes and they are -6.5 in one and -7 in the other. I can see a few inches in front of my face if I take off my glasses. If I couldn't wear contacts, then I would take off my glasses for the formal pics, but that's all.  And if my sibling and parents didn't have my back I'd drop out of the wedding party. If they still gave me a hard time, I'd consider not going to the wedding at all since they clearly don't care about me."
653,"Go out to a bar and have a drink and listen to some live music.

Go out for a nicer dinner and then walk home and have a nightcap on the way.

Go to an art museum, then have dessert and coffee after and talk about the exhibits.

"
654,"Yes, if she's lucky he'll take her as his wife! Not all girls get courted like that, it's quite romantic when you think about it. She'll never have to work again! "
655,"I think this (the month off) is the best option. Take some time away. Do intensive therapy. Figure shit out. If you need to leave your marriage, and you and your husband can work out that he will be the primary caretaker, do that. You do not have to continue to be a wife and mom 24/7 if that is killing you. You do have to find a responsible way to leave, and that means still having *some* involvement in your son's life. I hope that some distance helps. "
656,"The girl has blamed her freak out on a ""hormonal slip up"" in her texts apologizing to OP. See last paragraph. 

Normally I'd have the pitch fork too, but it's the woman herself who has decided to go with a female cliché rather taking responsibility for her actions. "
657,"Is this conversation happening in English or some other language, where an English speaker might miss some implication? Because if this happened in English... I would encourage you to consider the possibility not just that you are overreacting, but that you may need professional, medical help with your anxiety."
658,You have a daughter now. Time to stop treating feminism like a filthy thing that's beneath you. Seriously. WTF. You force your wife into a role she doesn't want and then get mad when she can be a working mother like a rock star. You better sit and think about this shit before your daughter gets old enough to internalize your misogyny. 
659,"It is really not fair to put this entirely on her. It doesnt matter that she had to talk him into it. He agreed. He went with it. If he was dead set against this, he should have put his foot down from the very beginning, not gone along with the idea for 3 whole years and thrown this at her 2 months before the baby is scheduled to arrive. The way I see it is this dude wasted 3 years of OPs life letting her believe she would be getting a child and then at the last minute throws it away. "
660,Lots of women nowadays don't take their husbands name - stick to your guns and don't be forced into it. 
661,"Being ""happy go lucky"" and ""going with the flow"" is fine if you're single and on your own - and is *incredibly frustrating* if you're also responsible for another person beyond yourself. You're basically not making any effort to spend time with her or date her, and so forcing her to do that work or else see an end to that side of the relationship. Being nice when you *do* hang out is not enough to cancel out this lack of effort, it is *the minimum expected behavior* of a friend, let alone a boyfriend.

That's really shitty. Yes, you liked how easy your lazy single life was - it is fun to just chill and do nothing for ages! But if you want someone else in your life, you have to step up and make the effort to be with them, not just push all that effort onto her. You have the makings of a very bad boyfriend who does nothing and makes her do all the emotional, practical, and responsibility workload. Cut that shit out now and grow up, for her and your sake."

663,agreed times a million. they are old enough to be her father.
664,"Augh OP you are living my worst fear. I'm gay too and the bullying I faced messed me up horribly. I actually left the country and live a thousand miles and a border away from where I grew up, mostly to try to move on from that part of my life. 

No real advice, but you have my sympathy. "

667,I think you're projecting a bit. I took this as the fact most people cannot carry two people. It was a bit insensitive and the fact you think this woman is at all to blame here is disgusting.

"
669,Well then that's a sad heap of internalized misogyny you need to work on...
670,"It's perfectly reasonable to not have any negative thoughts or feelings about her making money as a stripper, or even if she was a sex worker.

That doesn't mean you need to approve of your husband being friends with her.  You can have concerns about the relationship without having negative judgments about either of the people in the relationship.

Here's a concrete example that (I hope) is easy to understand.  Let's say you were an alcoholic, and had been through rehab a couple of times, and had been sober for a few years.  Let's say that you had just met a pretty cool woman that you had some stuff in common with, and it just so happened that she really liked to party-- she spent most Friday and Saturday nights at clubs and almost always drank so much she needed to take a taxi home.  Most weeknights she'd go out with co-workers to happy hour before going home.

In that situation, it would be entirely reasonable for your partner to love and respect you, and to feel proud of you for having come so far battling your addiction; and it would also be reasonable for him to think your new acquaintance was pretty cool.  But wouldn't it also seem very natural if he told you that he had very real concerns about whether you should become friends with her, and asked you to not pursue the relationship?"
671,"I think if my partner of 5 years honestly believed I cheated on him, especially with no proof, I would be considering breaking up with him. I would definitely shut down and be unable to speak to him. It would hurt too much. 

If he couldn't trust me after all the time we've spent together I don't think I can honestly say I could trust HIM anymore. I would feel like he must have cheated or been wanting to cheat if he would believe it of me so easily. "

673,I'd go with option C) quitting your job and never seeing any of these people again.
674,"depending on blindness, and how smooth the surface we're walking on I think I can do without glasses (I am -8.0 in contacts). Of course, its still wrong. The whole taking off glasses for photos is definitely more of a compromise enough. we're all still in agreement that the bride is a bridezilla. I hope your brother stands up for you. "
675,"I don't think her friends were trying to cast shade, I think they were warning OP that her plan might be perceived as culturally insensitive. If I had a creative idea to add a twist to a ceremony I'd hope my friends would let me know if they thought I was about to step on someone's toes. "
676,Thin walls suck. Invest in high quality ear plugs. :)
677,"&gt; Your wife's reaction is not the reaction of somebody mistakenly accused of adultery.

Yes, but the husband was dwelling on this the whole drive home, and he ""confronted"" his wife. That may have set a very aggressive tone for the argument. With an accusatory and angry tone, an innocent wife's reaction might move from incredulity to anger quite quickly."
678,"Wow. I literally don't have anything to say except you seem like you are in a clash of cultures.  On the one hand you talk about how you are ""integrated"" (sorry don't know a better word) with your white friends and their ""culture"" on the other you are talking about the possibility of an arranged marriage as an actual option.  I hope there's a large indian set here who can provide you with some insight, I don't think anyone white would be equipped. 

I actually think you are placing entirely too high of a premium on being married as if that state is the gateway to a happy life.  It's not, if it's not with the right person.  

If you feel white guys are mostly into you for an exotic experience, is there no middle ground?  I mean.. can't you date Indian guys without it being arranged? I am not saying that you have to ""stay with your kind"" or anything stupid like that. I have a lot of friends who are in mixed relationships and I've never seen anything like what you describe with the guys dating the asian or the other-race girl for the experience.  Not saying it doesn't happen but I've not seen it.  Maybe it's not your race, you just haven't met the right guy. "
679,"I don't know why, but this is my favorite r/relationships comment I've ever ready. Probably just because it's so simple. "
680,"I would uninvite her, personally. She shows so much disrespect and disregard for others that I wouldn't even want her at my wedding. 

As an aside, SIL drove fiance home but had been drinking at the strip club? Not cool, if that's the case.."
681,"No offense intended, but you sound 16. Sixteen year olds are sometimes jealous, moody, even controlling. But nothing you described sounds like anything more extreme than some high school drama. That doesn't make you some horribly emotional abuser, it makes you a teenager learning how to navigate relationships. 

Not to diminish your pain. Just to gently point out that you will recover and move on, and you'll do better in your next relationship because you now know better. And in the next relationship, and so on. "

683,"I had this issue as a teen. My little sister would take my clothes without asking all the time, and then she'd stain them and rather than putting them in the laundry she'd ""hide"" them under the bed or something.

One day I got fucking fed up. I went to Lowe's and bought a new doorknob that locked. Swapped it out myself and everything. Then I waited for a day when she wasn't home. I was able to clear out her ENTIRE closet and dresser. Every garment she owned. I shoved them all in my room, locked the door, and left for work.

The enraged phone call I got from my mom a couple hours later was so worth it."
684,"&gt;our lack of respect for her needs

What needs are more important? A hair dye/lunch or the bills for the house?

Your assumption that women *need* to have their hair dyed or go to lunch or else they face ostracisation is far more sexist than anything OP is suggesting.

How else would you approach the situation OP is in? Money has to come from somewhere to pay the bills."
685,"Recommend posting to r/legaladvice on this one. Girl wants to destroy you, won't stop until she does or she gets scared."

689,"Yea, I feel like it might explain why Diane wants to get in touch now, in that the friendship wasn't in fact ever the problem. It may also be why Diane is spinning it as if OP was the 'one to end the friendship', as she may feel hard done by as a result of the potential resentment harvested towards OP's wedding plans. I know technically OP did end the friendship, but I argue Diane really did through her actions and her half assed attempt at maintaining a friendship as OP rightly puts it. Maybe Diane was feeling jealous hearing how excited her husband was for the wedding, that OP would be in the limelight that day in her destination wedding...who knows! "
690,"Are you sure you are 35?! 

You lied, acted maliciously, threw a fit, and this is only two months into this relationship. 

His boundaries suck, yes, and he deserves to get called out on that, but your behavior is insane.

Break up. There is no point to trying to heal and regain trust if you can't be honest and mature at the two month point. "
691,"As a child of high functioning alcoholics, the amount of alcohol he is consuming plus is depression IS CONCERNING. 3+ drinks when he's looking after the kids? That's way too much. More than 4 or 5 drinks a day every day on the weekends? That's binge drinking. 

I know from experience that drunk parents affect a child's life in very real ways. I tiptoed around my parents because their tempers were on hair triggers. I never knew how they would react to anything, and it made me anxious and afraid, all the time. Watching a parent fall down from being too drunk or shouting or crying or being out of control is really traumatizing for kids. Drinking makes you think in black and white and children do not understand that. What if he was looking after the kids and drinking and your child had to go to the hospital? Please address this with him! Make him get help for his drinking AND his depression. It is necessary for your marriage and the well-being of your children."
692,Op this poster has a really good point and I think you need to really think about it. 
693,"I agree with others that it feels weird you won't even *meet* Kelly's BF.  I agree with you that you shouldn't have to be friends with someone else to be friends with her, but you literally won't even go over to her house if her BF is there?  Meeting the dude doesn't mean you have to be BFFs.  Do you still have feelings for Kelly or something?  Did you ever have a chance to actually get over her?  It sounds like y'all went right from dating to being BFFs, which didn't allow for any time alone to work through feelings."
694,"I really don't have much advice to offer.  I'd like to tell this story to your wife though if you'd like to read it to her. I was 34 when I had my son. I had an elective c-section.  My ob/gyn was very supportive of that.  I didn't have to pay out of pocket for it. I also don't tell this story often.

When we're pregnant, people seem to relish telling us birth horror stories. You never hear good, easy birth stories.  That doesn't help.  I don't understand why people feel the need to terrify new mothers. As a result of that I was literally pissing myself with fear by the time I got to the hospital.  I was shaking so hard I could hardly sign the paperwork.  I'll never forget the moment that changed.  The anesthesiologist looked at my face, cant imagine what expression I had on it, and he said ""I'm not sure how to interpret the look on your face right now""  I burst out with ""THIS IS IT? I got all worked up and scared for this?? I FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT""  And it was true.  It wasn't bad at all.  It wasn't scary at all.  It was nothing.  I proceeded to breeze through the surgery and was up and walking around within like 12 hours.  I've had dental surgery that was worse than that. I've had a SUNBURN that hurt worse than that. Everybody had me so worked up about how bad it hurt.  I dont even rank having a baby on my list of painful things I've had happen.  Seriously.  I wanted to share that so you'd hear a good birth story for a change.  Maybe in some small way that will help.  You'll be ok.  It'll be ok.  I promise."
695,"Oh as a future FYI if you do ever go to have children these people won't help you.

I have a few family members like this.  It was always about them needing favors.  I called in some to help after I moved.  I received minimal help but they did quite asking me to help them with no intention of returning the favor.  

They found helping to be exhausting and tiring...lol"
696,"I appreciate the honesty. The more I've been letting my feelings out, the more it seems like my mind is telling me the only option is to leave. The other part of me feels so disappointed that it's come to this after 3 years. I've tried so hard to make him feel secure and loved in this relationship (deleting social media, limiting contact with male friends he deemed a threat) and it's clearly not been good enough. I would just like to go 1 day without being accused of trying to leave him for a younger man. Which, if I do get the balls to leave, that will undoubtedly be his first line of defense."
697,True. A coworker and I were talking about a message I sent that he wanted more detail on once we were face to face. One thing I noticed was that my name had been altered to be of the male gender he explained he didn't want to have to explain every female relationship if his girlfriend saw the name so he changed most female names to male ones. There was obviously something more that drove his decision but just throwing out a data point to support the idea that it was was not unheard of for someone to misname phone contacts to hide gender and info in a relationship.

Let me say this again: If you truly believe that she is in an abusive relationship, then you are putting her life in danger. "
704,"It sounds like your roommate is in no place to rent out a room, and it sounds like you are in no place to rent with this person.  My first suggestion is finding a place more compatible with your living style. 
 If you wanna try and make it work, read below.

I am basically your roommate.  Not literally - but I am very type A about my belongings, and I like my home to look a certain way.  However, I live with roommates and realize that not everyone likes to live like I do, and I can't fault them for that.  It's not their fault that my standards are the way they are.  I nag them about what matters for the entire house (ie: you can't leave dishes in the sink overnight), and I leave things alone that are none of my business (ie: my roommate's laundry situation... I don't care if they have clean clothes to wear), and I let some things slide (ie: someone not cleaning the bathroom to my standards, but HEY AT LEAST THEY TRIED!... I'll re-clean it on my own and not resent them for it, because my desire for extreme clean isn't their fault).  Your roommate needs to realize that by opening her home to another person who will be paying to live there, she can't expect everyone to hold her same standards, and she can't fault them for not holding them.  As a paying tenant, you need to set down some boundaries as well.  Yes, it may cause tension.  Who cares?  You're just as entitled to be comfortable in this place that you're paying for as she is.

""I really appreciate you welcoming me into your home.  Obviously, you like to keep your home a certain way, but please understand that I am not you, and I do not know exactly how you like to keep your home.  My standard cleaning routine might be different from yours.  I'm not doing anything to try and upset you, it's simply different than what you're used to.  I am more than happy to oblige to your cleaning methods, but I need you to loop me in.  I'm not a mind reader any more than you are.  

Also, I'm paying to use this room as my own, so as long as I'm not doing anything illegal (which I'm not), what happens behind this closed door is none of your business.  It's my laundry, not yours.  It's my mess, it's not yours.  What happens behind this door has zero effect on the overall use of the apartment.  Also, if I'm behind this door, it means I want to be left alone.  It's not my duty to entertain you.  If you'd like to hang out, you can ask.  But I don't always have to say yes.""

Now, none of this may work if your roommate isn't willing to listen. 
 That's still not your fault.  Set your boundaries and stick to them.  You've lived with this person for a month (am I correct in assuming you've only known them a month?).  You don't have to be best friends with them, and the chances of you interacting with them again once you move out are slim to none.  Live your life as respectfully as possible until you can get out.

709,"&gt; I know that logically my only two options are to figure out how to make myself un-stuck and marry her, or break up.

Well....yes.   She (and you) need to know the answer to a few quesitons:

1) Do you even want to get married?  
2) Do you want to get married to her?  
3) What do you need before you feel ready to get married? 

You really, really need to sort those out, and stop lying to yourself about them or avoiding them."

-Your mother is a POS bigot and its not ok. I get it. I REALLY do, my grandmother was the EXACT same way. Only difference is I moved away and she never met any of my partners.

-Your inability to stand up for your partner and yourself(because this shit is disrespectful to you as well) means that unless you bring home some fine ass jelly spined black man your mother will never be happy.

-Speaking of which: TO HELL WITH HER FEELINGS. You're an adult. You aren't responsible for her feelings.

-You need to stand up for yourself. Which brings me to problem #2 Tony

-You need to knock into his skull that what his parents do is no better than what your mother has done. Not ok. PERIOD and he needs to have a talk or 3 with his parents about their comments. BTDT and the well meaning but ignorant can be taught. 

that's pretty much it to be honest. he's made it clear on how he feels about your mother and until she grows the hell up you should NOT expect nor want him to suffer her bullshit for you.

So overall reaching advice - Stand the hell up for yourself. Take your mother to task and FFS get Tony around your other relatives. If all they know is what SHE tells them it might as well be fact. Don' let Tony off the hook either for his parents and again - stand up for yourself. "
715,"It's never going to feel like it's the right time because this is a huge secret.  If you try and wait for a low stress time you'll keep making excuses as to why that moment isn't right. I'm sure she would much rather you tell her and show you want to change (i.e rehab, not self detox in a hotel room) than find out herself. Do it for yourself because you don't want to ruin your life but also realize that if you don't, you'll cause a lot more pain for everyone along the way. "
716,"&gt; I'm really nervous and feel like a silly 15 year old girl but there's something about you that just makes me giggly and nervous so I apologize in advance for being weird or awkward but I really want to learn guitar

That would have the opposite effect if she doesn't want to get laughed at or talked about. "
717,"Yeah, no. Please break up with her immediately and go back to therapy, do not pass go.

There are certainly ways to engage in rough sex/BDSM that are enjoyable and fulfilling for all parties involved, but that doesn't seem to be what you're talking about at all. BDSM emphasizes safety, pleasure, and carefully negotiated consent -- if aspects of fear, discomfort, or pain come into play, they're by mutual agreement, so that everyone involved has an experience they find satisfying.

That is, frankly, WAY different from wanting your partner to be sad and anxious. You seem to get off on this woman's pain, but from the way you've described it, it's not a kink you've both agreed to engage in, you're just a sadistic jerk."
718,"Yeah, I think he just had no place to go, nowhere to turn to for support or comfort. I have no idea what kind of person he is, what life he's had, but to unleash that sort of message on a total stranger (me), with so much pain in the language, and then also backtrack and say ""I'm so sorry"" it just screams to me that he doesn't have a good support system around him to get him through this. I was lucky enough to have that when I got back home. 

I just feel sorry for him, and it's not his fault for what his dad did."
719,"She wanted a divorce because she didn't think for a second I would have every considered it.  Hence the crying when I bought her ears.  She was trying to give me what I wanted.  

That is why divorce is not in the cards.  

Now, my line is this has to be incredibly private.  I have no problem making posts to forums if they are anonymous, etc.  If she needs this satisfied outside of our marriage then we need to be through as that is essentially the end of my professional career.  I am not a politician but close.  Think, cabinet member. 

I think she knows this and it is why she offered divorce.

Second,  I know some marriages have open relationships but to me, finding another owner would be the very definition of cheating.  Something she would also never be okay with.

Same with Fetlife, no problem posting anonymously.  No photos, no real contact, no credit cards, etc.  

Edit:  Words"
720,"After all that, he is well within his rights to not have to endure her shitty behavior, just like you'd be within your rights to decline his family dinners due to their comments about your race. 

But OP, when you get married, your spouse defaults to your most important family member. You need, for his sake, to stop communicating with your mom if she won't apologize for how she treated him, set the record straight about her bullshit to other family members, and stop badmouthing him altogether. Maintaining this status quo is the path to divorce."
721,"So, if there's one thing I hate, it's when people are pissed off at me, but instead of talking to me about it, or deciding to be nice and get over it, they just grumble and grouch at me but refuse to address the issue.

You've made it clear to your sister and her girlfriend that it seems like the girlfriend doesn't like you, and both are pretending that they don't notice when the girlfriend is obviously baking a batch of grumblecakes every time you're around.

So I really like to use this technique that my dad calls ""laying the turd on the table"".  When somebody is kind of *implying* to you that they're unhappy with the *hope* that you get uncomfortable, instead of talking to you about their feelings like an adult, you draw attention to their behavior until they either stop, or they talk about it.  You do that by being pleasant and sweet and inquisitive, but pretending that you aren't picking up on any of the subtle shades of meaning in their behavior, and just asking what they mean.

So if she's muttering ""oh my god"", you say ""I'm sorry, I didn't hear you?""  Not like, a catty ""ExCUSE me?  What were you saying?""  Just as if you honestly didn't hear her but assumed she was saying something nice.  If she's grimacing at you, you say ""You look upset!  Is something wrong?""  If she is answering you in short sentences, you say ""Did I say something to upset you?  You seem angry that I'm asking you this question.""  Just don't let her get her way (you leaving or feeling uncomfortable) without using her words.  Make her explain herself.

And she might just be like ""No, it's fine.  I'm fine.""  Or even get mad like ""I'm not angry!  Why would you say that?"" And then you can just be as pleasant as punch ""Oh!  Ok then!  Just checking!"" or ""My mistake!"" and let it go.

The point of this is that you are pointing out every time that she acts rudely to you without making a big deal out of it.  You don't let it just hang in the air and then get ignored.  You draw attention to it, so that everyone (especially your sister) in the moment can see what is happening, and what precipitated it and no one can pretend that she's not doing it.

My guess is that this is some conflict that's going on in their relationship, and your sister knows it's happening but doesn't want to admit it and is trying to pretend that if she doesn't acknowledge it everybody is happy.  Don't let that happen.

Just be nice, be polite, and point out what is happening, and let them sort it out.  Not your circus, not your monkeys."
722,So you never loved your wife or did the love just fade.  It will probably fade with this new girl too.  If the relationship is good work on it.  Crazy love is exhausting anyways. 
723,It sounds a little like a manic episode. But it's not exactly the same.
724,"It's SO possible. Honestly. And the fact that I'm even able to date and trust again (I was worried I'd be broken forever!) just shows that healing and a more fulfilling life is possible after processing and learning from the last relationship in healthy ways. And if you can work on yourself, spend your energy rebuilding and getting back to what makes you you, you will look back and be thankful for the lesson, but even more thankful to have your freedom and some peace.

One thing I didn't mention is that I honestly have not cried or missed my ex ONCE since the end in January. He contacted me plenty (to beg me to come back, to tell me all the reasons I'm horrible when I refused, and then to reach out to me for emotional comfort that I had been providing for years and I just refused to be his cozy blanket anymore). I never caved. The reason it took so long to leave was because of the manipulation. Stay strong and good luck if you ultimately decide leaving is the only option. "

I dont see breaking up with the person when you couldve talked it maturely which is the opposite of what you did. You are breaking 3 relationships not 2 mind you....

Whether you get back together hell find about it eventually because of your need to escalate(drama)things. Most constructive advice to give you is evaluate your train of thought and become a better person
"
729,"&gt; In January this year, I came home from 6 months overseas. Brad and my best friend Lisa had become good friends in my absence and had created what I considered a brotherly/ sisterly relationship

Six months is a long time, like long enough to really fall for someone. She says ""brotherly/sisterly"" but didn't realize it was just a normal relationship. They knew she was going to be upset so they hid it. Their actions are shady but they are under no obligation to deny feelings for each other when there was no future between OP and the guy. OP is just stuck on him but wont admit it."

731,"For what it's worth - if it ever comes up in future relationships, maybe write a quick note or something if you happen to wake up early and step out? Your ex was an ass to get angry at you, but I know I'd be a bit worried if I woke up and my SO was gone. My brain works slowly when I've just woken up so it would probably take me a minute to remember where you probably went. "

750,"Those were the same things your ex did...isolating you, controlling you...this is another abusive relationship.  You need to leave him.

I don't see you mention counseling anywhere after your last relationship so I strongly recommend you get it after you break up with this guy."

753,"I don't think you're wrong in the way you feel at all. Of course on the other hand, i don't see someone with serious depression thinking about anything but how they feel 24/7.

I think the important question here is, what would have happened if you had not texted and talked to your wife during the period, and instead told her you can't really talk right now because you're seeing family? Would you see your family more? Would it make you significantly happier? Would it make your family significantly happy? would it significantly affect your wife? I suppose what i mean is, did you do the right thing here (even if you didn't like it)? Was it important to your family and you to be more there, or are you just super annoyed at your wife?

The other issue that seems to be unavoidable here is the question of to what point is your wife responsible for her actions while she is having an episode? I don't really know how to answer a question like that really. Is she more excused for being self absorbed because she is having an episode? Should she apologise after the episode over her behaviour? Is she generally not a self absorbed person, excepting these times? Do you need to have some sort of plan or understanding in place for these things? 

Anyway. I say stick with supporting her. Being upset with her doesn't do anything right now. And perhaps you can ask people in your family for a bit of advice while you're down there. But talk to her about the whole thing when she calms down."
754,There was a thread from a nanny in this sub some while back. She posted because both the husband and wife were cheating and each were paying her to not say anything. She had some guilt about the arrangement. Seems cheating in front of the nanny isn't all that uncommon.

Sorry not buying your second comment. Your first comment does not support that.

"
762,"I used to work in a secure dementia unit of a nursing home so I'll try my best to give constructive advice. She can't help it, first of all. Her brain is changing in ways that will change her personality and no amount of yelling will help that. I know you know that, but it's worth saying.

Secondly, we were always told to just humor them and find a way to agree while still keeping them safe. For instance, there was a woman who tried to leave the unit every evening when dinner was being served to go home and make dinner for her husband and little boy. At this point her husband was long dead and her little boy was 60 and in a different state. I'd tell her that husband and boy called to say they stopped at the sandwich shop after baseball practice and she should go ahead and eat here. Then she'd say ""Oh, okay, thank you for the message."" and head back to the dining room. Maybe when your grandmother says absurd or unusual things, just humor her. Say ""I'll have that talk with Mom."" and change the subject. 

Third, I hope she's being very closely monitored. Dementia is degenerative and while she may be able to live alone now, it may suddenly change. We had a gentleman on my unit who was, by all accounts, completely fine and able to live alone if a little absent minded until he burnt half of his house down when he forgot he was cooking and left to go for a very long walk. Thank god he left the house and didn't go to bed. It's really hard to accept that our loved ones are in need of more help than we can provide. Spouses of the residents would always ask me if I thought their loved ones could be at home and I always had to remind them that they were in the safest place possible."
763,"Am law student and worked in family law for a bit.  We had a client whose wife did this and she never got punished for it.  Once you're in divorce proceedings, you shouldn't touch the joint account or take everything out (because court has to divide it).

But before filing divorce, the joint account is both of yours and you can take as much as you want on either side because it's legally yours as well.  I don't know what your particular judge or lawyer will say (family law is notorious for being more ""personally"" based and not so much JUST on factors and law because it's all so context dependent), but if you did it before filing or going to see a lawyer, I think you might be fine."
764,"My situation was reversed from yours though...I wasn't unhappy with our marriage as it stood. He was. 

He told me he was unhappy 10 weeks before he left, and I validated his concerns and got my act together.... but he was already in love with someone else at that point.

I think that, in this case, you're the one who is unhappy with the status quo (your reasons are completely valid), so if you're telling him your concerns instead of hiding them out of fear of hurting him/making him angry (and then just checking out), that's hopeful. I think it's important to word it explicitly as ""I'm unhappy,"" because that makes it harder for him to stay in denial that there are problems.
"
765,"I wouldn't be comfortable with all this. You guys are different. I'd say your dating the wrong girl man.

766,good lord the drama llamas you're dealing with here.
767,"So shove him off and say ""no."" If he tries to enter you, tell him no, not until you're ready. And if he persists, get dressed and leave. And make sure to tell him it's because he's bad at sex.

Seriously, there are MILLIONS of guys your age that would love to spend an evening focusing on you and only you before getting off themselves. You don't have to tolerate bad sex. Ever. "
768,You honestly need to break up with him. This is just one of a million ways his selfishness is  affecting and will continue affecting your relationship. At this point he's not even looking at your face to see if you're comfortable or not before sticking his penis in you. This does not have to do with age as people have suggested. I've had many partners since losing my virginity at 16 and there were only a handful who ever straight up didn't care about my pleasure and that was always indicative or the rest of their personality and all guys I stopped sleeping with cause of their core selfishness and entitlement as a person
769,"I had the same thought about lying or exaggerating about her behavior when drunk. Especially since she says nobody else in her life has ever commented about inappropriate behavior when she was drunk. And he got furious at her for getting drunk at her own birthday party where she didn't have to drive, after which everyone else who was there told her she was acting normal.

It kind of seems like she doesn't hold her liquor well and her husband is using her ""drinking problem"" to control her. Who gets mad at someone just for getting drunk at their own birthday party?"
770,"This is so true. I actually don't mind kids, but have worked very hard to cultivate a sneering ""I hate children"" witchlike persona to get around the assumption that I'll just be so happy to drop everything and watch anyone's child at any time, or look through several dozen photos of your child, or whatever else."
771,"First of all, leaving your 15 year old kid alone in a park in a foreign country sounds pretty hot-headed, stupid, and dangerous. She's a teenaged girl, of course you aren't going to like her attitude a lot of the time.


But you aren't privy to everything going on in your parents' marriage and minds. I doubt this is one isolated incident. There are probably other issues that are theirs to deal with.


But eventual divorce doesn't mean that relationships were the wrong choice. Divorce doesn't have a bad thing. You can have an amazing 20 years with someone and realize you have both changed, and then go on to have an amazing 20 years with someone else. A divorce doesn't have to negate happiness or make you regret a marriage."
772,"I sympathize because you are on such dangerous ground here. Your father is making your relationship with him contingent upon wider access to your daughter than you are comfortable with.  He appears to be a doting grandad now to others.  But will all this culminate in weaponizing their relationship in later years- breaking her down once she hits puberty, or sewing seeds of discord with your relationship with her.  I think you are right to be worried, but it doesn't make low or no contact easier.  Losing a parental relationship is tough, especially when others around you don't see the situation as you do."
773,"Buying tampons is super embarrassing for a man. People might think you know a female between the ages of 12-60 (EW!) or be the type of person willing to do someone a favor (YUCK!).

You know how I know that this is nothing like what you are implying? 
Because I know with every fiber of my being that that shit could only ever go down over my dead freaking body.

You're in denial and lying to yourself, because you simultaneously said this:

&gt; One day, my daughter will have opinions of her own. I was a daddy’s girl before I turned 12, and one day it felt like he just turned his back on me.

You know what's going to happen. You can predict what's going to happen, so why are you letting him continue his bad behaviors, continue letting her develop a connection to him so that (1) it will hurt worse when he seriously betrays her, and (2) he has a better case for grandparents rights, so that your ""Dead freaking body"" won't matter for shit because they'll be able to sue for visitation.

Being part of a child's life is not a right, it's something you have to earn. They have done absolutely nothing to earn this -- if anything, they have repeatedly shown you that you are making a horrifyingly bad choice by allowing them to remain in contact with your kid.

Be an adult, be a parent, and cut the cord."
775,"Use that time for something for you. Take up a hobby or read a book, visit friends, etc. But you agreed to this, it's not forever, it's important to him, so you should be excited for him and give your support. This is a major accomplishment. He's already planning to slow things down when you have a child, so let him have this now. "
776,"Okay. You have some issues. Hopefully you can resolve them. I have a feeling you're going to still be whining 16 years from now about how your dad never loved you or your child, but you've really forgiven everything! Promise! 

Good luck to you, but you're NOT okay being around your parents, regardless of what you keep saying to yourself. "
777,"Her being ""into names"" doesn't entitle her to shut him out of naming his own child! He said he wanted to discuss the name, she just doesn't give a shit what he wants. 

She's being an asshole, putting him on notice about that fact doesn't excuse it."
778,"Wait, so... you have *definitive proof* that you are the perfect size for her--the size she chooses when she is in complete control and only thinking about her own pleasure--and you're *still* insecure?

I refuse to believe that you're worried about her pleasure. If you were, you'd listen to her when she says that you feel good and bigger hurts, and you'd be satisfied that if she has a freaking sex toy your size, you're just fine. Just because someone ""can"" (by your weird estimation) take more doesn't mean they *want* to. Like, surely a woman could be tighter than your girlfriend, and you could probably squeeze your way in, but should that make her feel insecure?"

783,"I think you're trying overly hard to be the reasonable, high-road-taking, 'adult' here that you can no longer see the forest for the trees. Honestly, I think you still need therapy to work this out. Stop with the soft approach and open your eyes. "
784,"He's by far the most likely suspect because drinks aren't typically randomly spiked. It's virtually unheard of for someone to just spike a drink without a target. Nor do people typically target someone who they don't have some way to do bad things to (so they won't spike some guy's drink). Like, where would this guy get a spiked drink from if he didn't spike it himself? There's no one else who tried to make any moves on OP. 

Contrary to the old wives tales, people aren't often giving drugs away for free, and certainly not to unaware strangers.

While we cannot be absolutely 100% sure it was this guy (so this won't hold up in court), its seems highly likely that it was him, even without considering the fact that he has reasons to do this and has tried to get OP to try such drugs in the past.

Thus, I firmly hold that OP should act as though he drugged her.

EDIT: I saw below that OP explained more on the drink:

&gt;it was Powerade he had purchased and thus had a lid. The actual incident occured after we had left the club and were on our way back home, sharing a cab with the friends we'd made to a halfway point, this was about 9am. I hadn't had a drink of anything since about 1am so the source was definitely the Powerade.

That makes it even clearer that this guy drugged her. Nobody else is spiking a powerade. Those things also have seals you gotta remove when you buy em and the lid would be a deterrence."
785,"Sadly some religious people really *do* think using a tampon has *any* effect on a woman's ....""purity"" or virginity, and the like. Ugh. So gross."

787,"It took me a while to understand that a lot of guys do find it as a big deal. As a pretty girl, I've had all sorts of remarks made towards me. I don't reciprocate but I've become so used to them that I hardly even think of them as anything other than a nuisance. 

So tell her that it made you uncomfortable without being accusing or anything. What matters is what she does after she's been told this. If she doesn't take measures to distance herself from this guy or be more firm in the future, then it's time for another talk. "
788,"Quit getting hung up on ""responsibility."" Accidents happen, it doesn't have to be anyone's fault. "
789,"Listen, this is important: relationships are about compassion and not fairness.

I'm a lesbian. There is a *huge* amount of ""this is how we are supposed to talk"" among most 20-something lesbians. For the most part, this is great stuff. My girlfriends and I always discuss, rather than fight, and overwhelmingly there is a huge amount of kindness and compassion that honestly seems more prevalent than among my friends in straight relationships.

That being said, lesbians (and other people who are on this feminist boat of ""here is the right way to fight"" (which I am also on, for the most part)) sometimes devolve into Picking Battles For The Sake of Semantics.

It doesn't matter whose ""responsibility"" this is.

When there is an argument / disagreement / point of tension, there are only two things that matter:

(1) Were one of you intentionally acting maliciously? If no, move on to (2).

(2) What can the two of you do together, as a team, to avoid this tension in the future?

When thinking about behavior change, think about The Reasonable Person Principle. Take a step back and take a good, logical look at a situation. What is the most logical behavior change? The most logical behavior change in this situation is ""if you are going to charge your phone in the kitchen, you're not allowed to be annoyed when kitchen stuff gets on it."" Either stop charging your phone in the kitchen, or don't care if it gets splattered on. 

Focusing on each person identifying ""what role they played in a problem"" is never, ever, ever going to create a productive dialogue. It will, most of the time, feel mechanical and formulaic for at least one person. However, framing it as ""oh man, we together, as a team, have encountered a thing that makes at least one of us uncomfortable. Let's now, together, as a team, talk for a second about how we can avoid this in the future.""

In a situation like this one where your girlfriend was doing the Normal Expected Thing of cooking in the kitchen, and you were doing the Marked Not Expected and Not Required Thing of charging your phone in the kitchen, this is a pretty clear case where the brunt of the behavior change needs to be on you if you care that much about oil getting on your phone."

Don't try to solve your marriage issues right now, or even think about them, honestly. You're probably on opiates of some kind right now, right? that's definitely going to screw with your mental health and clarity. Get through the next few weeks, get through the surgery, *then* address it."
794,I would hope he goes to the gym during his lunch hours or something. Admitting that they barely see each other but finding time for the gym after looong work days is pretty egregiously ignoring the relationship.
795,"&gt;  Because it's supposed to be a great thing, that a girl lost her innocence to you and will never forget you. 

OK real talk.  Losing one's virginity as a girl is a pretty shitty experience most of the time. It varies from uncomfortable to actually painful, especially with guys in their teens and early 20's who are not usually focused on a woman's pleasure and don't really know or care about getting a girl off.

I can barely remember the guy I lost my virginity to and it wasn't this super sacred experience for either of us.  I don't care to remember it (or him) that fondly.

I prefer to remember the times with guys who really cared about me and about making sure I enjoyed sex.

If you want to fuck around, break up with her and date around.

If you have issues with your GF having sexual experiences and it seems like you do as you call her promiscuous then perhaps you should break up. Is your therapist able to help you with this?

797,"It seems like there isn't much compromise in this. You are at the 'it's my way or the highway'... literally. You are thinking of leaving the man you say you love because he won't keep things clean like you want.

How about hiring a house keeper to come in once or twice a month? It will save you the aggravation of feeling like he doesn't listen and save him from feeling like he is a constant disappointment to you. "
798,"Possibly. It may also be that he is into her, he is just absolute crap at relationships and communicating. In which case, he is best left untouched just because he lacks maturity. "
799,Exactly: unless specified in a will; so if he'd wanted the kids to get anything... will
800,"She's ""not in love with you"" and not trying. How do you see this situation being remedied without action on your part? What action could you take?  
Therapy if she's willing.
Dump her and get out if this will only get worse. Which at its current trajectory....  "
801,"Gonna give you the same bit of advice I've given many others, including myself:

Don't stay with someone who acts like they don't like you.

And it only seems difficult because you're a good person who has given someone who hurts you the benefit of the doubt for too long. There is nothing wrong with turning away from someone who is bad for you."
802,"My dad hates his mother but sometimes behaves very similarly to her. It was pretty funny how calling him ""Grandma"" when he was at his most annoying made the annoying behavior disappear. Maybe next time he insults you and then teases you for being a baby, saying it was only a joke, you could say something like ""Wow you sound like my dad right now"" (or something like that). If he's a good, self-aware person, it should work. "

I don't keep friends with people I've felt romantic about, so this is goodbye.  I'm really sorry to give you this shitty news by text, it was cool to hang out with you and I wish you the best in the future. Thanks in advance for respecting my space and not trying to argue about this.""

""This isn't something I'm going to change my mind on. I know it sucks but we aren't gonna be together. I'd appreciate it if you don't text me again.""

Block, ignore, and if he is REALLY persistent, warn him once that further attempts to contact you will be interpreted as harassment. He has a perfect vision of you right now and I promise if you play mean and whip out a little crazy, he'll bail really fast."

It's a cult and it wreaks hell on female sexuality. I'd love to give you some podcasts to show her too so maybe she can open up to the idea that the problem isn't Sex and she isn't dirty but the problem is the religion. "
809,You can quibble over words. Bigots are still bigots. 
810,"It's not just pedantry, these words completely change the meaning of what you're saying. People seem pretty unclear on how you view your wife and what exactly you want, based on the different words you keep using.

For example, you're telling me you want to separate but you told others you want a divorce. Which is it? How are we supposed to help when it seems like you don't even understand the difference, and what you want to pursue? You need to figure that out before you talk to your wife about anything."
811,"Cut contact.  Literally every relationship I've had where I didn't cut contact I regretted it eventually, regardless of who dumped who - that time without having that person in your life, without being able to stalk their facebook page, without getting to wait impatiently for a response to your texts, is initially painful but so incredibly necessary.  You need to learn the difficult lesson that you'll actually be okay without her, and you need to cut contact to do that.

Once you're to the point where you'd be excited to hear about her new boyfriend and to meet him, then you can resume contact."
812,"Let's face it, there's no way he could ever tell you he's most attracted to barely legals and have that go over well. The extreme stuff though - a lot of people watch it when normal porn doesn't do it for them anymore. It's an addiction, and as with drugs, they start developing a tolerance. That could be why he's looking at the jailbait stuff, too. Not necessarily because that's what he wants, but what he's conditioned his brain to need. There's likely already a great deal of shame there. Going straight for the jugular (""do we have to keep you away from girls"") isn't going to make him turn to you for help. And he's going to need a lot of it. It'll take time. He didn't get there overnight. It's your decision whether you think he's worth it or not, of course.

Granted, this is on the assumption he's not looking at actual child porn, which is a serious legal matter, and you definitely need to place your own well-being first.

I am curious though, in the last 8 years, your sex life has been solid? No sharp drop in sex drive or ED on his part recently?"
813,"I do agree that cutting her out may be too extreme, but many of us come from the perspective that if someone is seriously impeding your happiness, preferred lifestyle, and creating consistent problems for you, limiting their presence in your life can be beneficial. You're already doing a good job with the information diet. "
814,"So I agree with basically everyone here, but I'm going to ask some questions I haven't seen explicitly addressed, because maybe in answering them honestly you'll be able to recognize how much of a tool you sound like to those of us living in the real world:

1. How much time do you spend working out/reading/focusing on your hobbies per week? How does this compare to her weekly free time?

2. What does a day in your life entail? When do you wake up, what do you do between then and when you leave for work? What does a workday typically involve for you, and what do you do between work -&gt; home -&gt; bedtime? How does this compare to your wife's daily schedule, and what do weekends look like for you as individuals and as a family?

3. How is childcare split between the two of you? Obviously she's the primary caregiver, but are you pulling your weight at all?

4. Have you done anything to try to alleviate some of her daily stress, and give her an opportunity to focus on herself as much as you focus on yourself?

5. Have you tried communicating with her at all?

6. Have you ever had to **beg** for sex from someone who says they love you? Who talks about it to strangers in a way that sounds boastful? Have you considered that maybe you are failing your wife as a partner and by extension your family? 

To be honest, dude, you sound like someone who's only missing the opportunity to cheat, and would happily water grass on the other side of the fence if someone hot enough showed interest in you. I'm sorry for being presumptuous, but that's how you're coming off. If I was writing a character study on a shitty husband right before he met his affair partner, it'd basically be this post. All the elements are there: young children, SAHM who's not given time for herself, and a husband who hasn't quite checked into farherhood enough to understand that losing baby weight is hard as is, let alone when you have no support from the one person who's supposed to be your teammate. If she's still breastfeeding, it's not even in her or your child's best interest for her to be focusing on weightloss, so maybe pull your head from your ass as a first step. "
815,"And how is she going to learn not to pull that shit again in the future. 
Sometimes its better to confront people."

However. She did NOT have a right to use joint funds for a decision he had no part in, and she does NOT have a right to prolong a relationship with someone she lied to who doesn't want to see her anymore. "
820,"Dude. She's 38 and still doing cocaine. If she doesn't have her shit together by now, she never will. Experimenting with drugs is for your early twenties, not after 35. Please rethink this relationship. "

We have an Alaskan malamute and high 80's would kill him. "

I was in a funk for a long time and ultimately just got lazy. He did everything and I let him. And one day, he just lost it. It actually took maybe 2 or 3 times for this to happen for it clicked how much of an asshole I was by being so lazy. 

So you know what I did? I grew the fuck up. I love that man so god damned much that if he wants a clean house then he's gonna have a clean house.

It's trash. Once or twice a week. Tell him to get his shit together. It's disrespectful.

I recommend reading ""The Five Languages of Love"". Even better if your man will read it. Read it together. We did and it changed our relationship. 

We learned each others love language because we love each other. Find someone who does the same, if he won't. Life is too short.

Good luck, I hope it works out in your favor. "
833,"If you are set on leaving, there is nothing wrong with ending things. 

If you want to stay a give these changes a shot, have in mind some definite boundaries/goals. As in ""I will stay for x months to see if therapy is helping"" ""I will no longer tolerate x behavior"" ""I need x issue to be handled in y way"" or whatever works for you and plainly and clearly communicate these things to him. Working with a couples counselor to do this may be a good idea.

Just hanging on indefinitely with no clear goals is a ticket to repeat history."

835,"Tell her over the phone. That way she can get off if she needs to. My best friend had three miscarriages and that's what I did when I got pregnant, so she could have some time alone to process. That pregnancy ended in a miscarriage as well for me. "
836,"The mistake was mad and her relapse happened. Those things are true and you cannot change them.

But...

If you really love her.. be there for her. Help her conquer the addiction in whatever ways you can. Life is fucking hard and its full of twists and turns that you cant predict. This one is REALLY bad but if you aren't going to be there for your loved ones (or conversely, they aren't going to be there for you) in your darkest of hours, then what the fuck is the point of family and commitment? Love is a choice not a feeling. If you stand by her and help her through this dark time, that is how you know, how she knows, and how you demonstrate love. "
837,"Ok, if you are really friends with Kelly, why do you care if she has a fiance? 

If you can't bear to meet him, that implies that you still have feelings for Kelly. I can see why Amanda would not be OK with that. If I were Amanda, I would feel as if you hadn't moved on. 

Kelly and you are done, supposedly amicably. So, whatever Kelly does with her love life should be her business. You don't get any say over what Kelly does with her life. That would be terribly unfair. 

Normally, when people break off a serious relationship, they go no contact for awhile to help themselves get over the ex. Maybe that's what you need. 

So, maybe a solution would be to tell Amanda, look, you are #1 for me, so I think I need to distance myself from Kelly for awhile."" 

Now Amanda might not understand. She might be expecting you to be a happy smiley face and have no complicated feelings. Just tell her that it's nothing personal, you'll come back around to seeing Kelly as just anybody else, but for now, for the sake of the relationship, for the next 6 months or so, you want to hang with her other friends, but sit the Kelly nights out.

839,"&gt;If he was unhappy in this marriage, he could have walked out.

That's the thing with cheaters.  They choose the easy way to get their ego kibbles and attention they feel they deserve.  A healthy person that is unhappy in their marriage talks to their spouse and asks to go to counseling.

It's too late for marriage counseling; however you should go to individual counseling for yourself. Sure you could try to reconcile, but he cheated early in your marriage during the honeymoon period, which means he is likely to cheat again.  Don't do this to yourself.

You have a solid prenup, good for you.  Speak with your attorney, protect your assets and get out of infidelity.

You may want to check out websites such as the Chumplady Or survivinginfidelitydotcom for support."
840,"Ugh, I just got done housesitting for a friend. She'd asked me to feed her dogs while she was gone, not telling me that she left the big dog chained up in the yard whenever she wasn't home (all day long during work, and at night if she went out). I felt so bad for him I stayed at the house all week so he wouldn't have to be out in the heat all alone all week. Not on my conscience. he's a really sweet boy too. "
841,"&gt;My sister told me today that she has heard her mom tell the step-daughter that ""my daughter has a lot of savings for college and we're gonna add you as a beneficiary and share it with you too""... yeah no. That's not going to happen. She was referring to the money I've saved.

How sure are you about this? I understand you not wanting them to count on the money and fail to save, but you could also be making things *very* uncomfortable for your sister in her own home if you engage in a confrontation based on a misunderstanding she more or less created. At least that's how it will seem to them. The fact that she used the word 'beneficiary' which doesn't really seem applicable to your money, makes me wonder if you and your sister really have the full story.

If they haven't asked you for money yet, I don't think you have any obligation to engage in this very uncomfortable discussion. It is their responsibility to provide for their children. It's nice that you want to save them trouble but since there is no chance she can get this money without going through you, there is no need to defend it preemptively. The fact is, if this guy didn't save for his daughter then nothing has really changed for them. His wife may have lied to him, but is that really something you want to involve yourself in? And if the mom is embarrassed by the daughter running off and telling you her conversations with her husband your sister could end up in an uncomfortable situation with her new permanent family members. I would just think hard about this. I think you stand to do more harm than good by opening this can of worms. I think it's enough to just reassure your sister that her money is safe."
842,"If I were you, I would ask her to agree to at least there's two points:

1. The money can not go to her 23 year old brother. He's 23. He should be able to take care of himself at this point instead of relying on his older sister. 

2. Does her mom work? If not, she should get on that. 
"
843,"Yup, I'm on the gf with this one.

If you want to make someone happy with your gifts then you tell them ""hey, I wanna buy you guys a new dining-set, which ones have you eyed?"". Just bringing decor to someone's home is considered invasive and dumb nowadays. 

If she doesn't set her foot down now, then you will not awknowledge the problem and next thing you now your house is filled with loads of stuff she bought, cause you don't know how to tell your mom off and mentioning anything will be met with ""but you loved everything i bought so far"", ""i'm only doing that for you"".

Imagine if your FIL came over, said ""you guys need more workspace in the garage"" and next time would come and install something he has chosen without discussing with you. Yeah, a nice gesture, but noone asked for it and you don't get to decorate someone's house without consent."
844,"It depends. The brother is 23, knocked his Bf up, and Dana already helped out a lot before the baby died. The funeral and necessary school supplies I can understand, but they need to have a talk about how much longer Dana will support her family.

848,"How long have you been with your therapist working on this phobia?

If your current therapist is not helping you with it, it's time to find a new one. Because this IS something that can be helped by therapy. Of course, that doesn't mean you're going to love every dog you see, but the fact you don't go to parks, or pet stores, or do xyz to avoid dogs, is hugely concerning."
849,"You're not crazy or controlling for having feelings, for being hurt or upset or for not particularly wanting to hear your boyfriend talk about all the other women who turn him on but never do the same about you. 

He's incredibly immature and lacks self awareness to the point where I'm wondering if he's trying to upset you on purpose because are people really that stupid? And if they are, do they have to do their growing up and learning on your time?

 I'm not sure I could deal with it if I'm honest. "
850,"So you're basically his mother not his girlfriend? I'd have a chat with him and explain how emotionally this makes you feel - like he doesn't care. Nobody likes doing chores, but it's necessary unless you can afford to pay someone else to do it. Tell him you need to see some serious change or it isn't going to work - because it won't if you continue to be his forced mother/maid."
851,"I agree with you, kids do not deserve to be put through that kind of hell. Another issue for both short and long term is what will happen to OP's relationship with her parents (and possibly any other family) if she stays with this guy after he suddenly blew up at her father and then went MIA for days.

Whether this is a mental illness or not, he's aware of the issue and has repeatedly dismissed it by telling her he ""can't control it"" and they should just break up if she can't deal with it. He knows there's a problem, but he's apparently not willing to do anything aside from brush these bizarre extended outbursts off as ""panic attacks"" and tell her it won't happen again."

Cool, that's your choice. Your wife has a need for social interaction that you don't seem to share. This seems to be a healthy way for her to get it.

Interfering with plans and socializing with others during quality time with you are no nos. For sure bring those up to her and ask her to put her phone down when you are trying to connect. That's reasonable."
857,She's not punishing you. You made the decision to not prioritize her. She made the decision to not prioritize you in the will. How come you're allowed to make these decisions and she isn't? Why are you entitled to her money. Are you also going to fight your dad on giving your sisters a place in his will? You seem very selfish about this. You don't give a shit about anything but the money

860,"&gt;They weren't on speaking terms when we got married.
And I'm typing that thinking ""of COURSE they weren't. She was probably upset he was getting married""

Yiiiiikes"
861,"I disagree. Even by OP's own recounting, it seems her husband has been quite honest....she's just been in denial.

Her husband, before marrying her, called Paige in front of OP asking if it would have been a mistake to marry OP instead of Paige.

All the clues have been there since the very beginning, in plain sight, with flashing neon red lights screaming ""You matter less than Paige! You matter less than Paige! I love Paige!"". He even TOLD her that in the marriage, she just has to put up with it, no ultimatums. What is that, if not honesty?? The meaning to me is crystal clear, even by OP's potentially biased recollection - he meant, ""by marrying me, you accept you will be second to Paige."" And she accepted! And continued to accept! 

It's not the husband that was dishonest, nor his friends. He was just lucky enough to find the one sucker who was willing to ignore the flashing neon red lights, the clues right in front of her face, for 10 years. 

At some point, even though this situation sucks and the guy is scum, you gotta start wondering why OP doesn't take some personal accountability.

It's that saying..fool me once, shame on you, fool me again.....

OP's husband openly mocked her before their marriage, and has been openly fooling her ever since. At some point, that starts to be on OP. "
862,Why? Because she slept with guys before they started dating? Why is OP even being suspicious of a woman who is not his girlfriend? 
863,"This exactly why I posted - I'm not sure if I'm being hypersensitive, or if there's a real problem here. He's not hurting or harassing the kids, you're right. I think that it's a bit different if as a kid you go to a family's house, and all of the cousins play together somewhere (for example). What I've largely gotten from these comments is a reminder that from the kids' pov, they're being told that they need to be on extra-extra good behavior for a day, and there's no reason for it other than so that I can sit with my brother and sister. They're not spending time with family, or being treated as part of the family. They're definitely unhappy - it's just not a fun day for them. Not necessarily in that they feel slighted, which I'm not sure that they do.

I don't know. I feel like I would feel so much better about all of this if it wasn't just my family being sent off to another room, and my family not spending time with the rest. "
864,"We definitely need to get it in check. We motivate each other a lot so that's when it comes up, but it never occurred to me it could rub off on her. Should have known the little ears are always listening! Lol"
865,"Agree with most everything already posted here. You sound insufferable. Your girlfriend's responses are terrible, to be sure, but you *are* actually instigating and then you continue on. You police her, you talk down to her, you essentially place the ""blame"" squarely on her. She probs lashes out at you like an immature child because you talk to her like you're some sort of ""parent"" who knows better.

For the record, when you approach someone in the morning and assume they are grumpy and then tell them: ""oh, it's okay, I'll give you your space because I know you're not a morning person,"" you're essentially making their decisions *for* them. That's no way to deal with your relationship! I can see why this would instigate and annoy her. Sadly, she seems incapable of stopping the domino effect in its tracks."
866,"I don't have kids of my own, and I dislike 99% of kids on sight.  HOWEVER, there is much to be said for sucking it up and dealing with it at a family gathering.  It's a few hours out of one's life.  Being ""childfree"" doesn't mean he gets a free pass to treat your family like crap.  If I can fake interest in Shopkins and Barbie for 3-4 hours, so can he.

Growing up, the kids were usually at a separate table (though in the same room or in the parents' line of sight), and we went to another room to play or watch TV while the adults sat around and talked about their bunions and impending colonoscopies.  It's one thing if you let your kids ""run the show"" at family gatherings and it takes the fun out of it for everyone else, but it's quite another if he's just being nasty or purposely aloof or whatever.  I don't care if he doesn't like kids, I think his treatment of your children is out of line.  

If it makes the kids miserable, then it's time for a conversation with him...I know you hold him in high regard because he's been good to you in the past, but he's not being very good to your kids.  You don't have to be confrontational, but maybe if he feels the same about you (you're all he has), then maybe he will compromise after all."
867,"Yes, this! I've lost 40 pounds making one tiny change at a time. "

874,"Is this bad enough to merit having *noone* left in my family other than the kids? I mean, their father is technically alive, but he's not legally allowed near us anymore. And my sister exists, but she's a mess. At least with my brother I know that (for example), when my ex hit me, I could take the kids and sit in his living room until I found bought tickets to my parents' house (they used to live across the country). And now with them gone - it's just the three of us left. 

He wouldn't take the kids in if something happened to me, but if as adults they needed something desperately and I wasn't around anymore, I do think he'd help. He's stubborn and frequently and asshole, but he's my brother."
875,"Some else with probably adopt it. Considering that it took them three years to finally get a child, there is someone else who would love to take the child instead "
876,"Take a walk around the city, go to a museum, go to a park or zoo! Many fun things to do to exercise!"
877,OP said herself she doesn't make enough to be a single mother. 
878,You might get better answers over on /r/raisedbynarcissists if you haven't already been there. 
879,"Your mom and sister fucked up big time.  This is the sort of thing that literally psychologically damages people and turns them into hoarders later in life.  And it really does sound like they are controlling people that wanted an excuse to exert that control over you thoroughly.  

It's hard because you're the kid and they are adults.  The only advice I can give is to get sneaky - from now on, everything that is really precious or private to you should go under a floorboard, into a hollowed out bedpost, ceiling tile, something like that.  Get a part-time or summer job and start saving so that once you hit 18 you'll have a head start on supporting yourself.  "
880,2 or 3 years feels like forever to a 15 year old though.  At least it did for me
881,"They are human beings who deserve the same kind of respect. 

People treat kids like this and are shocked when teenagers act out LMFAO. 

I treated my daughter with respect and she's a teenager who treats me with respect, because she wants to, because she enjoys our relationship because she doesn't feel below me. "
882,[removed]
883,"You're massively overreacting by wanting to call the police, and being massively unfair by judging the other girls mother so harshly...she could have the exact same reaction as you, considering this has happened with your daughter in your house under your supervision. 

I wouldn't worry about this in the slightest, actually. It sounds like most of your shock is occurring because you're interpreting an 8 year old's story through the eyes of an adult. ""Adult movies"" to you, for example, mean porn. To an 8 year old, adult movies are movies that their parents have told them they can't watch until they're older. 

Similarly, you're applying the adult concept of sexual desire onto these 8 year olds, when all they're really doing is acting out their understanding of ""exciting adult things"" that they've seen glimpses of in the ""cool older kid movies"". Neither of them seem to have any real understanding of sex -- kissing with tongues and pretending to hump with clothes on is the most outrageous, funny, and exciting concept they're aware of. 

None of this sounds sick, abnormal or worrying to me. I would suggest maybe introducing your daughter to some basic sex education seeing as she's starting to take an interest and become more aware of these things. Nothing in depth, just stuff like the differences between boys and girls, where babies grow and how they're born, where it's OK for people to touch them and where it's not OK for people to touch them (which applies to adults and other children), nudity and privacy, the difference between loving your family, friends and romantic partners, that some people are gay and some people are straight etc."
884,She didn't give her consent. It would be rape even if she was 18.
885,"If you are not able to be left home alone without a babysitter, you are not able to consent. 

And WTF were your parents thinking? As mother of a 16-year-old, the thought of some 30-something dude being eager to ""babysit"" makes my hair stand on end, there's nothing normal about it, 30-something dudes usually have other things to do, at the very least. I wonder how Steve talked them into thinking there was anything normal about this setup.

Edit: I think we all know how, lots of practice. I'd bet any amount of money you aren't the first, or even third or fourth victim of this creep. He has a well-established MO of pushing boundaries. It's no accident that successful assailants can be extremely charming and appear trustworthy, they work hard at cultivating that image (see Bill Cosby). And it's no accident he chose you. He figures you are in a position where you are too scared to tell, he's so confident of it he's talking about ""next time.""

I hope you prove him wrong."
886,"I think you're completely entitled to your feelings. What they did was super fucking uncool and intrusive. I can't believe they actually threw away some of your clothes.

Honestly, this strikes me as them thinking your room was lame, or not appreciating your style and interests, and trying to mold you into what they think you should be like. How awful."
887,Lol some parents might sign up for a couple days to go have some free time. 
888,[removed]
889,"You don't want to have to work too hard at the fun stuff in a relationship. They're always be fights about dishes, laundry, etc. You've also never experienced a relationship with anyone else. Don't get married because she pressured you into it and if she continues pressuring you say, ""I love you and you are my best friend. I want to spend my life with you, but I have serious concerns about what our sex life will look like. Right now we are having sex every two weeks. When we do it's amazing and it's an experience I would like to have frequently. Every two weeks isn't enough for me though and I fear it would only become more infrequent as we get older and demands of jobs, kids, etc take their toll and I know if I wake up 10 years from now with an infrequent sexy life I will be unhappy."" "
890,"Yeah, your cousins are using you. Prepare for many people to attempt to use you in life once they find out you have money. Sorry you're learning this lesson now but it's one that will continue to pop up. There is a reason why the most successful wealthy individuals are very guarded when it comes to dolling out favors or letting people know how much money they have. "
891,[deleted]
892,"&gt; I know it was sometimes hard for her, but I assumed we were okay.

That's what you get for assuming. If you had actually bothered to talk to your mom, you might have learned that you weren't ok."
893,It's tough - it doesn't sound like you did anything wrong. But he's probably doing the right thing for his relationship. 
894,"I don't know his friends all that well, so that's totally true that he's possibly constantly bombarded with this stuff, which I hadn't thought about.

And you and a few others have brought up that he probably just really wants to talk with me as an adult, not with kids around as a parent, which I need to think about more, maybe.

I'm not big on facebook (it's really just a compilation of vacation photos over the years for me), and I'm pretty sure I don't bombard him too much. I know he's not a kid person, so he won't be interested in whatever adorable thing a kid did that day."
895,"I've been trying. I had some friends, but moved, and it's hard where I live now. I tried really hard to make sure the kids would have a great school district, but *wow* is there a shortage of single ppl in this kind of suburbia."
896,"RIGHT? That's what's mind boggling to me.

How does a 23 year old just ditch his mom like he did and not even understand how he abandoned his mom? He seemed to have bonded AWFULLY fast with step-mom aka homewrecker while barely doing the bare minimum to ""keep in contact"" with his actual mom who raised, and fed, and cared for him his entire life!  

23 with no empathy sucks, but it seems like he's 30s now and not much better. "
897,"Ya, I am pretty shook up about the whole thing myself. Like I don't want it to be over though."
898,"wow no. You can be friends with whoever you want to be but replacing your gf with her best friend on a MONTH long trip, no just no."
899,That was just about the dumbest thing you could do. Way to ruin your relationship. 
900,"Just want to say that your mom sounds like a wonderful and respectable woman, and I hope your brother is able to realize and show gratitude for that before it eventually becomes too late."
901,This is going straight to my googledocs.  But yeah this relationship isn't working out.
902,"he doesn't hate the beach, and they picked the hotel together. he's just clapping back with a teenager-y ""well I DIDN'T WANT TO DO X BUT I DID IT FOR YOUUUU"" over something that never bothered him to begin with in order to make her feel guilty about objecting. "
903,"Proofreading and editing are different. It's one thing to draw someone's attention to their mistakes so they can make their own changes; it's another thing to fix the mistakes for them, without them even being in the same room or seeing what those mistakes were. I'm a HS teacher and would consider someone editing the grammatical mistakes out of another person' paper to be academic dishonesty, because part of their grade is on not making grammatical errors. I guess if OP was just adding comments to the document flagging mistakes instead of actually changing the text, that would be proofreading - but his post sounds like he was just changing her words with 15 minutes to spare, not trying to help her find her own errors."
904,"What's the rush? Do you have secure careers? Own a home? Have great health insurance? A couple extra thousand lying around each month after your expenses?

Having kids is insanely hard work, emotionally and physically and financially. They don't want her to go from being a teen to being a mom so fast. And they don't want to suddenly be thrust back into caring for a child. They just got her out of the house. 

Trust me, your future self will thank you if you do some real thinking about this and wait a few years. "
905,"One of the best comments on here.

908,"Wow. People are so weird, it boggles me. Its a freaking color. Can dogs even see purple? "
909,"You can't knowingly violate someone's express wishes for years and then laugh at them about it without malice. You need a fuckload of malice to be able to do that.

Mother doing what's best for you is one thing, but when you think it's hilarious to know that you've made your child not be true to what they want for themselves, you absolutely have intended malice. No caring parent would think this is funny."
910,"She didn't say anything about trying to join. She also didn't say he gets mad over text; she was saying she worries about ""warning"" him she on her way home will ruin the mood for him. There are enough issues here - stop making up shit. "
911,"Lmao that'd be like if my wife was super emotionally abusive and I was like ""well, aside from all the mean and degrading comments, everything is fine!"" If you're okay with bullies in your life, by all means, continue. But just because they're bigger than you doesn't mean they're entitled to bullying you. Thin people are shamed all the time for being thin, yet we're expected to just put up with it, because we're not overweight *currently*. That's never right. "
912,"Firstly; I don't think you were completely out of order to react that way. He had no right to make comments about you, call you names, and when you tried to walk away he continued. He certainly had no right to touch you like that.

However, I think what your parents mean by apologising is to just mention to the others at the party (individually) that you are sorry for the outburst, and didn't want to make a scene. But don't forget that it was his fault. It will help the others understand the situation and not be left with an inaccurate opinion of you. By the sound of the guy, I expect they will understand your reaction more than you may think!"
913,"I mean, do you NOT want your boyfriend to care about you? All of the instances you described are a good reason to leave work. Granted he probably could have explained better that he had a family emergency before leaving. As for the car accident, I can't blame him for being mad. He obviously really loves you and cares for you and you proceeded to intentionally keep him out of the loop after a car accident to prove a point. "
914,Then you need to cut down your contact with him. Stop making excuses.
915,"Here let me fix this for you:

""My [20F] ex-boyfriend [24M] has a crush on one of my ex-best friend [20F]

921,"Have a look at /r/raisedbynarcissists and see if any of it resonates...

You may see some of your Mum's behaviour there, to a greater or lesser degree.

Only you can make the decision of whether or not this relationship is worth repairing.

One of the other commenters has suggested that your Mum is looking to manipulate you through these purchases - do you think that's possible ? Or do you genuinely think she is trying to fix your relationship ?"
922,And we should refrain from making them because discussing people's weight is rude and unnecessary.
923,"*He tried to blame you?* There truly is no salvaging this. If he's not sorry for what he did, he'll do it again."
924,"May I ask, did your relationship last? Did he ever get better?"
925,"Thank you for your reply. I'm sorry to hear about your mother, but it's reassuring to read about someone so similar to my own - my mom is the kind of person who swears she is never at fault no matter the situation, refuses to take responsibility for her actions, and very rarely if ever apologizes. That's why when I saw these book titles, I didn't feel as though she was trying to self-reflect or improve her own parenting. It would be out of character for her. Obviously there IS a problem, I just didn't realize it was any different or worse than it has been the past 21 years."
926,"I bet that if your girlfriend were to give us her version of things, we'd be hearing a completely different story.

Either way, she can decide you're not what she's looking for anytime. Even if your side of the story is completely accurate and objective, it's obvious there are some serious incompatibilities between you two anyway. There is no right and wrong here. Wrong is stringing a person along when you already know you don't see a future with them. Deciding the incompatibilites are too much to proceed is normal, healthy and mature.

For future reference, keep in mind that finiancial help doesn't obligate people to stay with you. You actually have to be the partner they want/need on top of that. "
927,"Why? Current dog is beyond his ability to handle(which DOES happen with fostering), that doesn't mean ALL foster dogs of the same breed will be EXACTLY the same. My answer would be the same, then again I'd have had a leash ready knowing someone was coming and as best as possible non jumpable fence.

TBH any dog can be a problem, ANY. The only difference is level of damage."
928,Even if it isn't a breed issue it's totally fair for OP to ask her bf to not have something that could trigger anxiety around. If OP was a vet and asked that her bf didn't set off fireworks around her we'd think that was reasonable even if there was no danger. Same here. Her bf can rescue other breeds of dogs!!
929,"Honestly, not a long shot at all. This happens a lot in Asian families, especially if the parents are always working and there's a big age gap. I'm the older sister and my brother and I are 10 years apart. I basically raised him until I went away to university. Now that I'm in my 30s, my parents still call me to discipline him and parent him in their place.

Fortunately, I have a great relationship with my brother. During my twenties though, I didn't want kids until much later in life and that was directly from the experience of raising my brother. I can see how different people could internalize the experience very differently especially if they didn't get along with the sibling."
930,"Look, you said it yourself. You can't change the past. But you know? Actions have consequences. You and her dad had a choice on when and how to begin your relationship. You knew he had a child. You could have made a choice to wait on your relationship and do it the ""right way"". Unfortunately, for everyone involved, you chose not to wait. For whatever reason, you decided that whatever the consequences would be, they were a good price for starting your relationship under those shady circumstances. Welcome to the consequences. 

I think this is probably the most appropriate use of the phrase, 'You made your bed, now lie in it"".

That little girl has a relationship with you based, not on the person you are, but who you want her to perceive you as. That's not an honest relationship. You and her dad are making it seem like her mom was just a fragile soul who couldn't handle reality. The daughter deserves to know the truth about why her mom actually had a breakdown. The consequence of that truth is that she will discover that you and her dad were willing to put her well-being in the backseat to your relationship. She has every right to form a relationship with you based on the truth. If that means she pulls away from you and sees you differently, that's the consequence of your actions. Not the mother telling her, but the choice you made in the beginning. 

You decided, with eye's wide shut, to go down this road. This is where it went. 

If I were you, I would own up and be the best example you can be of accepting responsibility for your actions. Don't do the whole, well, your mom had problems before, and your parents marriage wasn't great anyway.. just don't. Own up. Accept responsibility. That will save your relationship with this person and set a much better example for how she will tackle owning up to her own mistakes in the future. "
931,"Ya, if she's actively choosing not to make more money she can't expect you to cover her. Full stop."

Your friend is jealous. She's worried she's losing you to the ""cool kids.""


Everyone involved here could stand to grow up a little. Once you move past high school these arbitrary definitions and categorizing people based on their interests (anime vs.sports, for example) becomes weird and immature. If your boyfriend knows you and likes you for you, and you're happy, then it's a good relationship worth pursuing.


I think an ultimatum is appropriate. Tell your friend she was hurtful and that if she can't trust your choices and support you then you can't spend as much time with her. And then I would look into yourself to maybe make some steps to get to know yourself beyond defining yourself based on interests and labels. "
937,"You'll have to use them. Just use them BEFORE sex. ""Hey partner, I get turned off asking for sex. But you don't seem to notice when I try to drop hints. Here's what I'm doing and how I'd like you to react without me asking in the future.""

Since you're asking him to basically do what a lot of guys would love to do it should be fine. If it's not you'll have to talk about incompatibility because he may not like giving the kind of attention you want. "
938,"&gt; (as snobbish as this will make me sound) when you socialize in certain circles, you are expected to be open enough to know and read body language. Example: touching during a conference is a no-no. Limited touching afterwards with a glass of champagne is okay, so is during a gala. Or during a family visit to a vineyard.

I'm going to assume family visits to the winery weren't that common when OP was in foster care. 

I don't understand why people are acting like a) the adult's behavior is understandable and b) the OP should have a better grip on his actions. First of all, he's a teen who is still learning how to navigate social situations - not everyone automatically *knows* how to act in certain settings.

Secondly, I somehow doubt his birth mother sat him down to say ""Now honey, if someone is drinking champagne, *limited* touching is perfectly fine, especially during a gala!""

Also, shaking hands is *very* different from touching a back. I'm in various social settings quite often. *Do not touch me other than the initial hand shake, especially if we do not know each other.* "
939,"Don't give the baby his name.  This is your kid, use your name.  Tough shit about the car, he should have thought about that before getting emotionally intimate with 2 other women.

Kick his ass out, tell your parents, you don't need to be taking care of yourself post-surgery, a newborn, and his immature leeching ass.  Who cares if he doesn't have anywhere to go, that's his problem and not yours.

"
940,"Yeah, he's a fool, should have run out the other door or a window and gone to call the police.  But what did you expect him to do, come get punched in the face by these guys too?  They'd have probably roughed him up a lot worse than they did a woman.

945,"Sunk cost fallacy is a terrible thing. And staying in an abusive relationship because ""divorce would be such a fuss"" or ""I don't want to upset the kids"" is just torturing everyone involved out of fear that things might be quite bad by leaving, when staying is already so much worse.

946,"Tell your parents exactly why you were uninvited.  If they are like my parents, they will skip the wedding out of solidarity.  My momma don't play that shit.

Also...Tell your mutual friends.  Don't shit talk either P or M, just lay it out.  *Apparently M doesn't want me there for some strange reason, so P uninvited me.  Is what it is.  Guess we aren't as good of friends as I thought we were.*

Annnnd....If this were me, and just because I can be a petty vindictive little shit, I'd fedex my wedding gift to P's parents house and ask them to take it to the wedding since you are no longer welcome.  That's some grade A level shit stirring.  Attach a nice note about how much you care for them, how you wish you could be there, but since you can't, you just wanted to make sure they knew how proud and happy you were for them and for P.  Really pour on the thoughtfulness.  

But, you don't have to go that far if you don't want to.  But you shouldn't be ashamed to tell people why you aren't going.  You were uninvited for nothing you did wrong.  You don't have to protect either of them from the repercussions of being asshats.  That's not your job"

Other widows/widow-equivalents have told me similar stories. It took like 9 months to get back to a kind of romantic equilibrium, where I felt like I could trust my feelings as not being some crazy ""rebound"" type of thing. In my case I just tried to ride the whole thing out for the most part. What she's feeling is normal. Acting on it probably isn't wise, but even that isn't entirely clear and she shouldn't beat herself up for it if she ""slips"" and enjoys some intimacy with someone at some point while she's grieving.

She should also definitely talk to her therapist about it all."
950,"This is totally an issue that your husband should be dealing with, not you.  Leaving it up to you is only going to make it look like you don't want her there but her son does....it won't do anything to further your relationship with her and can possibly be detrimental.  Your husband needs to call her and ask her to reschedule her vacation time...she can come out around Christmas (or later).

If you need to frame it differently for your husband, explain to him that babies don't have strong immune systems, and until vaccinations start happening, you're not comfortable with mil bringing a bunch of people around baby.  It's not safe.  Especially right now with all the anti-vaxxer nut cases letting measles and whooping couch come back into the population.  And I'm being serious...you have to protect and advocate for your baby...too many people don't understand how important it is to not come visit a newborn if they have a cold...or that they should always wash their hands before holding a newborn...or that kissing a baby can transfer herpes to a newborn with no defences.  Ask your doctor what they think.  "

954,"Completely false. My workplace had a manager who was sending sexually aggressive and inappropriate messages to many women he was managing. He sent the messages outside of work time, and he got fired. (It took a while and all the women he was harassing had to put together a full report of what he was doing and submitted it to HR to get it to happen. But he *was* fired because of it.) Even though it happened outside of work, it was still drastically affecting the workplace environment."
955,"All the signs definitely seem to point towards the inclination that he is cheating on you.

The biggest red flag here is that he had a hotel booking for this female co-worker (who he has a history of being too friendly with) on the same weekend that he had an ""emergency shipping"" issue to attend to for work. What a coincidence. I don't know of any platonic friends that not only share e-mail passwords, but ones that are a combination of both their personal info - those are not things that ""just friends"" do. Those are cute, personable things that lovers do. 

Not to mention that it is significantly easier to book a hotel yourself than through someone else - that would mean that this girl gave your husband her credit card info and other personal info in order to book this room, as opposed to just doing it herself? I call bullshit. They booked a room together using her name and her info so that (assuming you guys have joint financial accounts) you wouldn't see a random charge for a local hotel on the weekend he left. They are being clean and calculated in hiding this from you. Your husband slipped up when he forgot to close the browser when lending you his phone as he seems to keep communications between them deleted. By frequently deleting the evidence (all conversations with this woman) and letting you have regular access to his phone, he can create the illusion that nothing is wrong.

956,"&gt; I also accept the fact that hormones make her do weird shit that she usually would never do, but that doesn't mean that it's easy.

&gt;  But I was always underperforming in career and personal goals - I truly let my depression and anxiety get the best of me and that created a lot of tension and domestic issues.

Abusive partners usually make the victim feel like it was their fault. It sounds like that's what he did to you, and you believed it. You were 19 and still are only 22...how exactly are you supposed to perform? Most people haven't even graduated college yet at your age. 

&gt; But why is it so hard? I see and feel him in everything I say and do. 

He was your first adult love. No matter how shitty they were (and he was shitty to you), you will always have feelings after a break up for someone who you were in love with. 

So, you're going through your first ""adult"" heartbreak. That's okay. If anything, I think this relationship was a great learning experience. You seem to have some emotional issues (depression and anxiety) which you need to work through before you can have a healthy relationship. But also, it would be good to work through these issues so you can find a healthy partner. He wasn't. Besides the obvious emotional abuse he put you through and anger issues (it can be traumatizing to date someone with anger issues--even if they don't direct them at you...which he did), the age gap is quite glaring. You're only beginning to realize this, but our 20s are essentially a different kind of ""puberty"". Within a year, you'll be different. Within two, you'll be significantly different. The changing and maturing doesn't end at 18 or sometime in high school (at least, it shouldn't--the people who don't change are the high school burn outs whose glory days are long past). So, for him as a 29 year old to go out with someone who is still very much in a high school mentality is kind of a red flag. It indicates a lack of maturity at the very least, or a kind of predatory nature (abusers often go after younger partners because they are easier to take advantage because of their immaturity and automatically assume that the older abuser knows best). 

To summarize, you did the right thing, and now I think you need to work on yourself. I wish you all the best."
961,"Exactly. So you should be able to bring this issue up with him. 

Edit: actually I think I misread it a little bit. But that aside you should still be able to bring this up with your husband. "
962,"No, but you can;t pretend that a relationship with a clear sell-by date is the same as one where the end point is one of you dies.

Also, ""exclusive friends with benefits"" doesn't mean it's not a real relationship. You're being as judgmental as you're accusing everyone else of being."
963,"*Is there a way I can make her respect my decisions?*  I don't think there is, OP.  Your mother and father are feeding each other's delusions than they own their children and can dictate their lives. Their behavior is would-be cult like.  My advise is to separate yourself from them financially.  Put them on an information diet.  And limit your contact.  If one of them starts up with the orders, whines and demands, say ""I think not, Mommie/Daddy"" and hang up the phone.  Sad to say, your parents would suck the life out of you if you let them. Protect yourself."
964,But she's not asking you to be responsible. She's not asking you for anything. She's not complaining. She's not refusing to let your BF go through her room at night. She's dealing by keeping the lights on. What's the problem?
965,"Gather all the evidence you have, including the letter he sent, emails, texts whatever and go to the police. "
