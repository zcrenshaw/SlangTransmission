0,"You don't have to deal with that bullshit. They helped you out, as *any* parent should with their kid(s). Paying for your books (up until you were in highschool, at least) is their duty. You didn't ask for their help in college and paid them back in full + a very generous gift the *one* time you did need the help.

It absolutely is your money and it's up to you what you want to do with it.  If you really want to, you can always give them something. You should never, ever give in to the passive-agressive bitchiness your parents are currently displaying, though, especially given the fact that they can pay for their essentials.

Edit: couple sentences."
1,"Or she could very easily turn into the kind of Tiger Mom horror that OP is scared of.


And you don't get a do-over, so kind of a risky proposition there.  "
2,Thank you for taking the time to respond. You're right. I should've left when the deleting and lying didn't end. I tried to give the marriage a chance especially since I risked so much for it. Lesson learned. Thanks again 
3,"Asking is a good default. 

Did you tell that guy that you didn't like him doing so?"
4,Thank fuck I'm not the only person side-eyeing this.
5,"What are you doing OP?

This man *crushed you* in the most soulless, cruelest way possible. And when you lost weight, he came back. 

You know without a doubt that his attraction and love for you is based on *how you look*. And you're putting up with it. You're essentially shoving self worth out the window in a bid to try to recapture old love. 

**Your relationship will never go back to the way it was**. The sooner you realize that and move on, the happier you will be - because then you have a chance to *truly* appreciate you for who you are. "

7,She sure knows how to pick men. Omg he is showing signs of perv marrying desperate lady so as to molest her daughter. Big time.
8,"Ugh, yes.  Honestly he should have known that most wives would be at least a bit uncomfortable with an old fling moving in so close.  And I must echo what everybody else is saying- he needs to shut it down.  Not you, him.  It sounds like he's enjoying the attention, and it's entirely possible it is just an ego thing.  However, every time he doesn't shut it down is going to embolden her.  I'm with you, I'd be pissed at him.

Maybe you can show him this thread."
9,"For what it's worth I am proud of you. You're going to feel anxiety but I promise you, you're doing the right thing. 
"
10,I don't understand why you are still seeing him. And I REALLY don't understand why you are letting him film you having sex.
11,"That's not what ""playing the field""  means. ""Playing the field"" means you're actively engaging romantically/sexually with other women. You're free to find people attractive, you just shouldn't act on it if you're in a monogamous relationship. "
12,"&gt;She has apologized countless amount of times, and begged me to take her back, saying that she realized I was the one for her.

Yeah she didn't cheat because you guys weren't together, but that doesn't change the fact that she needed to go on a break and bang another dude to see that ""you're the one for her"". I'd wonder whats going to happen the next time she starts catching feelings for someone else. Another break so she can get it out of her system and ask for forgiveness?

I'd let her go."
13,"&gt;He invalidates my feelings by citing ""logic"", goes back and says he didn't say things that I know 100% for certain he said, etc. That sort of thing. 

This is absolutely gaslighting and emotional manipulation and you deserve better, nor is his issue one you need to hang around and try to fix, especially since he's trying to gaslight you into believing gaslighting isn't real with his ex wife comments. Run. You'll be better off."
14,"A lot of friends and family I grew up with are either dead or in jail because they didn't want to look weak.

She needs to grow the fuck up."
15,"The danger is that because of the 'double' relationship, what happens if they split up? It makes things very complicated.  "
16,"She's mixed, Black and Mexican."
17,"*I just feel like I'm taking too much from these people who have already been so kind to me.*

It's OK to take things which are freely given. 

And consider also, they aren't giving the name to you. They're giving it to your son. Sounds like they already consider him their grandson, biological or not."
18,"&gt;He got so mad at me he stormed out the front door and slammed it shut so hard he bent one of the hinges so it doesn't shut right.

&gt;""keep your fucking mouth shut unless I tell you to talk.""

&gt; He had such anger towards me he screamed 

&gt;I'm scared to death of his reactions 

Get out. 

Not only is he dishonest, but he's treating you like crap. "

20,"Your grandmother will likely have to evict them to get them out.  They are now residents in most municipalities. There may also be occupancy violations with that many people in a 2 bedroom condo. Paying the bill to get her out might be the safest and cheapest option. 

Stop trying to be cool and try to teach those kids to be responsible humans. Maybe if you and your grandmother nag all FIVE (too many people!) of them constantly they won't *want* to stay. "

23,"You don't owe her anything. So if you want to just cut all contact without any explanation then that's fine. If you want to tell her why it's over and not give her a chance to explain herself, like over text, that's fine to. Whatever you wanna do."
24,"Jeez, that doesn't sound like an issue with political differences, they just sound like assholes. It's not like there's a political party that's in favor of battering women."
25,"He is male but the title says 36 F. I read thru it first thinking this was a story about a woman until I got to the ""clean shaven"" part. "
26,"I wish people wouldn't hate on all age gap relationships so much. They have a higher potential for failure, sure, but they can and occasionally do work out very well. Just depends on the age of the younger partner, both their maturity levels and level of baggage.  I've had five amazing years together with my 14 years older partner so far--best time of my life. I love him.)"
27,"Go visit and see how bad things really are. If you deem them intolerable, look into a youth hostel you can stay in. Most cities have one, and they're usually pretty cheap. 

Once the holiday is over, call CPS and the city's health department. They'll do a check in and demand things be cleaned up, especially if the house has a major mold or fire hazard. They'll work with your parents to get the place cleaned up and to get them some sort of professional help. You can always do the report anonymously and claim it must have been a neighbor that peeked in or one of sister's teachers complaining about the way she smells."
28,Is that a serious question?

30,"If you feel like it's too soon then it is.

Personally I would not consider moving in with someone before I'd been with them at least a year. I don't think you can really know enough about someone in less time than that. 4 months is way too soon in my opinion. Evaluate after a year. But please don't do it at 4 months - you are still in infatuation stage and haven't experienced enough of life with this man to know how he will behave when stuff gets hard. 

Also, why the age difference? Not to be judgmental but 35/23 is enough of a gap that you'd probably want to be extra cautious here. There are some crazy guys out there. A guy this old targeting someone as young as you may not have the best intentions in mind. Be careful.  "

32,"&gt; He also experienced a traumatic event the previous night.

IDK, that might be a mitigating factor.

If this isn't a pattern, if it is a one time thing, I wouldn't jump to calling this controlling and abusive.

I'd cut someone who was depressed to start with, and then got assaulted, robbed or raped, some slack *the day after the assault.*

As a society, we don't really teach men how to process traumatic events or depression itself. We expect them to ""get over it,"" and when they can't it's very easy to start spiraling, because men get the message they are less than human if they are struggling.

Instead there needs to be a discussion on why this can't happen again, and how he needs to reach out to his support network and professional help.

If this behavior continues and becomes a pattern, *then* it's abusive.

EDIT: grammar"
33,"And there are women who have thick hymens and are shocked when their considerate, well-lubed first time results in a bloodbath. I was one of them, and it took a year of painful sex and a further tear before it was finally gone. It isn't the norm, but it does happen now and then, and it's terrifying when you're the unlucky one and no one told you it could happen. If I had been properly educated about this I could have had an OBGYN remove the rest of it surgically after the first time and saved myself a couple of years of trauma and being misdiagnosed as having vaginimus. ""The first time never has to hurt"" is an unhelpful falsehood for the unfortunate few for whom it isn't true. "
34,"He works 50-60 hour weeks as a chef (generally a high stress job), he *is* compromising his own health."
35,"You think one of his exes used him for his mouth? I think you over-dramatizing and need to get over yourself. 

Fix your jealousy and fix your attitude. You're not losing your attraction to him, you are destroying your relationship and whatever faithfulness he might have toward you. "
36,Looks like we found his girlfriend.
37,"Is 5 pounds really a huge portion of your budget? What do you each spend on coffee, going out, alcohol, etc? It sounds like his anger is grossly disproportionate. 

It is also disturbing that his reaction to having a conflict was to chug a glass of wine and then finish off a bottle of liquor. If this is not the first time you've seen him drink to deal with stress, maybe he has a drinking problem."
38,"&gt; Apologize, acknowledge what you did was inappropriate

OP, be specific about why it was wrong, and explain to your boss that you are sorry as you have explained to us. Don't tell him or her about how ""hot"" your victim was, but do let them know that you're open to sensitivity or some kind of training at work. Actually, I would let them know that you think it would be the most appropriate solution here. Frankly, I'm thinking you won't be fired unless they have a zero-tolerance policy. Look in your manual, or your old orientation materials to see what the policy is on sexual harassment."
39,"He's not just going to start treating you with respect if you stick around (although you deserve respect, as any person does). Try not to let yourself get too hung up on the sunk cost fallacy here; you already spent three years with this guy, but that doesn't mean that you need to keep spending time with him! How many more years of feeling this way do you want?"
40,She does not have to justify her choice.
41,Have you tried talking with your doctor or a sex therapist about this? They might know of things that could be affecting you or ways that have a good chance of working. I would definitely talk to a doctor or therapist about it. You both could even go to therapy and learn new ways together that might get you turned on.
42,"does that somehow make it not a real relationship? whether they'd been dating 5 weeks or 5 years, inviting someone else to thanksgiving and not his girlfriend is a dick move. "
43,"I think everyone else has covered your wife's behavior pretty well, but you also need to look to your own mental well-being, regardless. Having suicidal thoughts because someone is giving you the cold shoulder isn't normal. Working with a therapist can both help get/keep you on an even mental keel, as well as give you some perspective in your marriage. Take care of yourself!"
44,"&gt; You're totally correct and not at all rude about it?

Downvotes also help hide irrelevant comments, and the comment, though factual, is not relevant to OP's issue or the comment they replied to as it currently stands."
45,Gas lighting is a specific type of abuse. The term is highly overused here and is not applicable in this situation at all. 
46,"Wow. Just wow. This is what I would tell your mother.

*This woman is carrying your son's child, your grandchild. If you keep behaving this way there is a chance she will never bring your grandchild around to get to know, and I won't blame her. Behave better.*

Edit to add, yes go talk to Sara. She would probably appreciate knowing she has support in your brother's family."
47,"Maybe I'm just horribly cynical or something, but wow, I really didn't expect such a reasonable explanation for the drink thing. I still maintain that Will is mostly just a harmless weirdo and hopefully not an active threat to your relationship, but you're more reasonable than I gave you credit for. "

49,"&gt; I really can't imagine the mindset behind charging your partner rent? Living with a partner should be living together as though you're married..

It's semantics- ""charging rent"" in a partnership is more like ""sharing expenses.""   
If she lives in the home and enjoys the benefits of the home then she should share in the expenses of the home."
50,"I think the commenters here are being a bit precious to be honest. As long as you don't do anything outrageously stupid like sermonising about the politics of your ancestor's homeland without having any real understanding of it or talk about getting tattoos of a country you know nothing about, I doubt any one will care about your lineage. "
51,Yeah you missed the boat entirely.
52,"I'm catholic and lived on the border (donegal/derry) with half of my family in northern ireland. The IRA were and are terrorists. No ifs, ands or buts. Blowing up major economic centers with massive bombs makes you a terrorist. Disappearing people makes you a terrorist. "
53,"&gt; what is the difference between someone paying for sex as opposed to someone who's never had it paying for sex?

You're going to remember your first time for the rest of your life.

My first time was awkward (at ""late"" in life... I was 24 at the time), but I'm not embarrassed about it because I was with someone I cared about and, while no longer together, still talk to occasionally.

If your first time is with a pro, chances are you're going to feel bad about it and subconsciously associate that ""feeling bad"" with sex itself and nothing good can come of that.

But... hey, this is Reddit Pop Psychology at it's finest...

Edit: Also, to address this comment...

&gt; I've learned in my life is that I'm the kind of guy that women don't really like

The only kind of guy that women don't like are insecure assholes.  I can say from personal experience (I'm most certainly below average looks), that being confident and generally happy about being YOU will actually get you more women than you think it will.

Will you be dating supermodels?  Probably not, every single one of my ex's has been SIGNIFICANTLY more attractive than me and most of my relationships lasted at least a year.

So, get yourself to a point that you're pretty happy with yourself and make sure you at least SEEM confident. It works wonders.  :-D"
54,"To be fair, McGregor is my favourite UFC fighter too and I'm not even remotely Irish (or American). Or like UFC. That dude's just badass."
55,"So much this! I wore a light coloured scarf to an important meeting last week and it was nearly an hour before I noticed my partner's long, dark, curly beard hair right in the middle of it looking EXACTLY like a pube. FML."
56,"&gt; I bet plastic bags aren't sounding so crazy now

:-) "
57,"I consider it in the same line as well. Milder form on the spectrum, but still over the line for me."
58,"My older brother and I are similar to your brother.  I happily have few/no friends though I've forced myself into enough social situations that while it's tiring I'm able to interact with relative ease.  My brother has worked hard to have a solid group of friends but still struggles daily when interacting with people.

My personal solution was mostly years of customer service and management, however I think my brother's solution will work better for your bf.  He signed himself up for Toastmaster's a while ago to help him with public speaking (for meetings at work) and it's helped him be more confident in sharing his ideas as well.

For people like us, social skills are like a muscle and need to be regularly exercised to be of any use and he needs to find some way to essentially grind his Charisma score up."
59,"&gt;This is honestly so so stupid BUT the fact that he lied again is what gets me.

It's not stupid. If you can't trust him to be honest about little things like going out with friends and how much he bet, how can you expect to trust him on big, important things? Trust and honesty are SO important in every relationship.

If you want to try to work this out, you need to make sure he understands that you expect honesty from your partner. ""Don't lie to me to spare my feelings; I'm an adult, and I can handle it."" If he's not willing to meet that expectation, then you need to leave. But no more lies, period, not even little white ones."
60,"Yeah, that part creeped me out. It sounds like lack of confidence is something OP likes in his women."
61,"I feel like everyone has to learn this one day in our lives. It's hard when you feel a connection with someone in certain ways, and in other ways you don't think the same at all - it's difficult to comprehend. Anyways, best of luck to you and I think you are making the right decision."
62,If he's doing this to you he's probably doing it to other women too. Your sister might have realized this but is either too proud or too embarrassed to admit it. She just want a child maybe to fix the relationship or just to distract her from the crappy relationship. She needs to wake up.
63,"No, you can be together **any** period of time and if one partner wants to end things and isn't open to working through issues then the relationship ends. "
64,Then she's very lucky to have you. 
65,"I'm gonna talk to them about it.  I don't feel any different, honestly.  And honestly the more I think about it, I can understand why they didn't tell me.  I mean that's hard to explain.  Like physically mom birthed me but with different DNA, very confusing.  I think it required taking biology to understand lol."
66,He told me. He complained that he couldn't stop.
67,Thank you
68,This is a MASSIVE breach of trust. I'd be pissed off enough to break up with someone over this. She definitely should have known better. There's no excuse for her telling her friends about something this deeply personal to you.
69,"&gt; *commercial airline* and you are *not providing transportation for anyone for free*.

That is the opposite of how that works...  She isn't commercial and likely would be breaking quite a few laws if she did take money, though I would hope there are exceptions for family to pay costs, and only costs.

73,"&gt; The truth is, you did.

I don't see anywhere here that he chose porn and masturbation instead of sex and intimacy. Sex and intimacy were not an available option in this situation that he rejected. You can't say he chose porn instead of her if she's not on the table.

74,"If he is adamant that he doesn't have 37.5 seconds to send a text, it doesn't sound like he has time for an actual relationship"

80,"Understanding isn't required, only obedience.

If you don't understand why someone wants to keep something about their life a secret, fine. You just need to respect that they want it to be a secret.

If you need emotional support because of said secret you get a therapist."
81,"For real, you need to be responsible, both of you

-he needs to face that you told him and he didn't do it


Your bf is a bit like me. Does he drink; smoke or do drugs ? Could he be depressed ?

Anyway, what I do now is that I annoy him so he does it now and doesn't put that for later. 
I also calmly remind him of what he said. How he contradicts himself. But I try not to scream or be angry in my corner"
82,"&gt;He said I get offended too easily.

He said this. In an argument arisen from him taking offence to a casual conversation he wasn't part of....

There was nothing to get offended by, yet he still managed it. And now he's offended that you turn off his games, and offended because you're going to leave him, as he thinks he (somehow) deserves loads more chances in his lifetime.

tbh I'm offended you're still with this guy!"

85,"Though the OP doesn't specifically mention if she focuses on *healthy* foods, just that she shares ""favorite recipes."""
86,"&gt; You're right to be questioning your entire time with him because really,

Overdramatic nonsense. He did something really stupid and mean many years ago. They've been in a committed relationship for more than 20 years. Yes the time together over and above the period he was an arse is worth a hell of a lot more.

I really wonder sometimes if there's commenters on this board with a compulsive need to try and wreck people's relationships."
87,"&gt; Every other North American tourist tells you they're Irish despite having basically zero Irish ancestry.

92,"Heh I was an RA and one of my Residents went around stealing posters from every floor. I walked by and saw he stole a bunch of birthday decorations we made for another RA, among other ""souvenirs"" from each floor hanging all around his room. It wasn't a huge deal to me morally, but I couldn't just let it slide because he technically stole from my coworkers. He didn't even register what he did as stealing because the stuff seemed like public signage (aside from the birthday poster). I got a good laugh out of making him walk through the whole ten-story building and put everything back where it was! 

That said, this isn't too big of a deal and I think you might make your living situation more uncomfortable than it has to be by ratting her out. Let her get her own stupid ass caught."

96,"I don't care if he's fucking around or not. But you wanted theories and I gave one.  

Still, good that you talked to him and got an explanation. "
97,"Thank you for this. I think I do agree with you, so thank you for putting it like that. I tried not to show myself in the best light, but I think it's Human nature to try and position yourself in the right. 

You're right, we have had these discussions before but we can both be a bit... stupid. Like we'll have the conversation about saving and then a day later he'll buy us cinema tickets, for example. I can see why this was a source of annoyance for him though. 

As for the de-escalation thing, I try to give him time to do that, but sometimes he leaves the situation entirely and will give me silent treatment for 1 day+ so I'm never sure when to step in and try to sort the situation out, because it seems like no matter how long I leave it, he will never come to me to sort it out! "
98,"Why wonder and go so far as to post about it?  That seems way beyond day dreaming.  As a 25 year old woman this post actually made me physically uncomfortable.

111,"Confrontation isnt a dirty word. Its an important life skill. If you dont learn how to do it people will walk all over you. You cant depend on people respecting boundaries if A) They dont know where they are,  B)You dont stick to them and C) they dont care about boundaries because they arent good people that respect you. Confrontation isnt about screaming and yelling and calling people names. Its about standing up for yourself and realizing that what other people think isnt any where near as important as your boundaries. And people that ignore those boundaries after you make them clear arent people that respect you to begin with. So learn about the difference between friends and people that want something from you, because I suspect these people are the later. "
112,"It's just that now he thinks he can do better so he wants out to explore his options. It's just his scumbag brain in action. He's probably not doing it on purpose, so I don't mean that in a disparaging way. Anyone of us could feel the same way in the same situation. It's just proof that he wasn't really that into her in the first place. There was never really any admiration or feelings of commitment, not enough feelings of this person is really special.

You sound extremely naive if you don't think there is a difference between being a lawyer in a big expensive city and a small town.

Being a lawyer in a small town is extremely dependent on having local contacts and connections.

&gt; Breaking what Jennifer and I each considered lifetime commitments to people I love and respect when we made the original decision to move here. Throwing away what I've spent my life doing. If I was the attorney of the two of us, no-brainer.

Any commitments you and your ex may have made when married are null now that the relationship is over."
117,"&gt; Furthermore, the research is pretty solid and clear that outcomes are better for children in two-parent households.

This is... not how that research works. The only way your kid gets a two-parent household is if you somehow miraculously remove her from the woman who has been her primary caregiver for 5 years now. That, in itself, would statistically come with a negative outcome. Please don't try to twist studies like this. It's silly."
118,"&gt;Then I considered finding out her address and sending her a copy of Holes, by Louis Sachar, and 20 minimalist Pepes printed between the pages, with a note ""This is a riddle. If you solve it, I will leave my wife for you. Love, Fiancé"". 

So...wanna be best friends?"
119,"Every single parent will make huge mistakes. My oldest kid has no sense of danger. She would scale the house whenever I wasn't looking. Every.single.time. She was fucking awful. I turned into a hover mother beyond anything normal. 

And yet my twins fall off of something all the time. I will be watching one while the other dives off a counter top. Damn kids. 

My husband thinks he's dad of the year yet he never changes diapers when he has the kids and their genitals essentially rot off until I get home. He doesn't rememeber to change them because it isn't his usual job. I can't seem to find a way to fix that one...

123,"I love this response. Show him it's not some seedy job where she's secretly slinging drinks in a bikini. Bring him in. Show him the office, show him the responsibilities. Perhaps even let him talk to some of the dancers, not as strippers, but as real people working real jobs that she helps to supervise/manage.  Humanize this shit. If he still can't hack it, let him go."
124,"I think I should clear something up. This isn't about pain I caused them, this is about them having this idea that all addicts are bad forever. While I was under their roof, I never stole from them or anything like that. I was only an addict for a few months before they kicked me out, it wasn't like i was there for a few years. Sure it was a build up with pills, but when i started injecting, maybe 40-50 days after was when they kicked me out. I didn't even have the chance to do something horrible to them like steal their TV or something that a typical junkie would do. Sure I lied to them all the time about where i was and what i was doing, but i still respected them at that point. 

If I had stayed longer, I probably would have done something horrible to them, but you gotta understand this isnt about me doing something horrible to them like most addicts do, its just that they dont trust and despise addicts. Its not as if i caused them pain (im sure emotional pain), they are from puerto rico and the stigma against addiction is INSANE there. Like they view addicts as less than people, they view them as someone who should be killed or thrown in jail. "

-&gt; get her a salon visit (cut/color/style)

-&gt; completly ruin  the lingere before you help her burn it by trying to wear it yourself (make her laugh about it!). Tell her she can take a picture if she promises to stop hiding from you when she cries. ""Hulk"" out of it, etc.

134,"She may very well have a disorder that the doctor isnt aware of. Doctors arent by any stretch infallible. If it's been a year and it was a sudden change, something is clearly off. She should get a 2nd opinion. If she's nodding off like that, it could become dangerous"

If the issue is something like ""son doesn't feel a parental attachment to stepdad"" why can't they try to do something to change that? If the issue is ""son feels abandoned by his father"" why can't they try to do something to change that? If the issue is ""son feels bad because all his friends at school live with their moms and dads"" why can't she try to do something to change that? "

138,"&gt; hint that he may not be as macho/straight as he claims to be.

This is definitely about feeling the need to be perceived as masculine by others, whether he's also worried he seems gay or not. I'd ask him to go to pre-marital counseling, and consider counseling himself. He needs to reconcile the person he wants to be with for life with his self-identity, and I think that'll be a lot easier if he can let go of his macho self-image. It doesn't seem very easy to try to turn *you* into someone else, and he needs to confront these impulses head-on."
139,"One of my dear friends (white) was in a similar situation. They were together for years without his (South Asian) parents knowing. The one thing he told her was that if it came to a choice between her and his parents, he would, eventually choose her. But that if she let him handle it his way, that shouldn't be necessary.

They're married now with an adorable infant, and her in-laws LOVE her. By the time he told his family, they were just so relieved he has someone, *anyone,* they didn't even care she was white. And now one of his cousins is also married to a white girl, and that was totally nbd.

My point is, your frustration is totally understandable, but it's not a lost cause. Ask him how he sees this going in the future. Will he tell them? When? What happens if they react poorly? What's his game plan? And see if you find his answers satisfying. If not, then you may have your answer."
140,"She's not being callous. She is the one who has to look after him. You are literally leaving for 6 months (probably he won't live that much longer?)

You can't give someone else responsibility for your ""best friend"" like that.

It's easy to shit on your wife for wanting ""the easy way out"" when you're literally on another continent. She's the one who'll have to let him out every 4-6 hours, she will have to change her work schedule even further whilst you choose whatever you like, she'll be the one cleaning up after him 100%, giving him his medications and vet visits 100%.

As a pet owner I would listen to her, anyway. His health issues aren't great, and if you two really are best friends, he is going to miss you horribly. I couldn't cope with going away for 6 months when my elderly pet is on his way out. Do you not think it's better for you and him to say goodbye like this, now? Do you really want a repeat of your childhood dog again? That kind of thing can be very traumatic, for both of you.

The rule of thumb with pets is that however much in pain or bored you think they are it's probably twice that but they're hiding it. It sounds like he's had a beautiful 10 years with you, especially after being an ex-racer, poor thing. But you know he won't live forever.

I wonder... are you hoping he'll die/need to be put down when you're away? Because you have no experience with this? It's horrible but we expect to outlive our pets and it's best if we can be there with them at the end. I am sorry that you are going to lose your little friend. Please think about his quality of life, his relationship with you and your wife, and your relationship with your wife (I hope you haven't called her callous or said you're disgusted to her face!)"
141,"Don't lie, just say you wanted to fuck sock puppet."
142,"Oh, yes, I understand this completely. You read the situation exactly right. He feels he's doing more for the relationship and in return I am doing LESS. That seems very unfair to him and he is hurt. 

Both in counseling and outside of it, I've explained it to him like this: ""I can't be the way I used to because that was hurting me and draining me. It was exhausting for me to take responsibility for your emotions. It is also unfair for you to expect me to keep doing that when you admit you can't even be emotionally supportive of me when I explicitly ask for it. I don't like being hurt and exhausted, and I don't like giving when the giving isn't reciprocated. This is a time of renegotiation - and this is part of what we are negotiating. If you don't like the way things are, you can work on being more emotionally supportive of me so I feel like giving back to you again, or you can work on being more active in asking for what you need instead of expecting me to guess all the time.""

144,"Wrapping up Thanksgiving dinner at 6:30 seems a little early so could you possibly start the whole thing a little later?   

I host just about every family dinner because I live in an older condo with a huge living/dining room area, so I have the room.  My typical timetable is:

5:00 pm - arrive for drinks and appetizers in the living room  
6:00 pm - move over to the dining room and sit down for dinner  
7:00 pm - serve coffee and dessert  
8:00-8:30 - wind up conversation and make the move to say good bye at the door  
    
This is 3 to 3.5 hours but seems sufficient for us.  No one in my family has ever had a problem with this.  


I think what you might have to do is create certain 'indicators' showing that the evening is drawing to a close.  

- make one last check for anyone wanting a second helping of dessert or coffee  
- if not, start clearing off the cutlery, plates and coffee cups  
- do not invite them to move from the dining room table to the living room  
- if anyone migrates to the living room and makes themselves comfortable, do not offer them anything to drink  

There's no reason why you have to adopt a routine or tradition that mirrors your sister's.  Create your own hosting template.  

Good luck and let us know how it goes!  "

146,"Well, at least your wife is hot. I totally understand your discomfort with the situation. And I think it'd be different if she were just doing photo shoots, with a pro photographer and calendars were being sold at car shows. But the fact that she's doing that with the people she works with, and that the photos are likely to be up in the office.... That just feels weird. Your wife is going to become the office sex symbol. It's just way too personal. I think it's pretty normal for you to not be comfortable with your wife's co-workers knowing what she looks like on her hands and knees. It blurs and sexualizes their office/professional dynamic. I mean, the girls from the Go Daddy commercials aren't actually answering the phones there. "

150,"So you're saying it is your husbands responsibility to get you a job and because he didn't do it perfectly he ruined your career? 

Having boundaries for your partner is NOT the same as having insecurities, why the need to shame the guy over this? 

There is nothing wrong about not wanting your partner to be sexualized in this manner and there is nothing wrong with being uncomfortable with having sexualized images of them spread around their own work place.

To suggest this is because he is insecure is fucking asinine and absurd. From OPs posting it doesn't appear he is insecure just that he doesn't want his wife posing for a posting sexualized images of her self for others.

That's pretty fair.

&gt;Marriage is a partnership, which means your wife is allowed to have ideas and initiative of her own. 

That also means she has to respect her partner and his wishes. It is a two way street. It is completely inappropriate to pose for photos like this and post them in her own work place.

Even if he was ok with the pictures having them spread around her work is a line crossed.

&gt;She is also, ultimately, in charge of her own body and has to deal with her own decisions.

So does he. While it is her body as a partner she also needs to respect him and his boundaries.

He is not being unreasonable nor is he being insecure. What she did was wrong unless they have a standing agreement."

154,"I think you should go back to therapy and find someone who clicks with you like the rejected therapist did. Keep in mind that I'm not a professional anything, at all, but I do have an emotionally abusive, controlling, asshole narcissistic dad who did horrendous damage to my self-esteem and loaded me down with issues enough for ten people, mostly stemming from fear that I'd grow up to be like him, so I feel like we're coming from somewhat similar places. What I think is happening here is that you're subconsciously choosing assholes because your parents basically trained you to have absurdly low standards and expectations, to the point that they forced you into an abusive relationship with a loser probably for their own benefit (connections with a wealthier family).

It's a sick joke among psychologists and therapists that a woman with a history of abusive relationships at a party will instantly gravitate towards the guy most likely to be an abuser based on body language alone, and studies have shown that most abusers knowingly recognize and seek out victims with low self-esteem, and in many cases intentionally target people who had shit childhoods because they know they have a better chance of getting their hooks in. You're above and beyond this, since your parents for some unfathomable reason seem to have been actually *deliberately grooming you to pick losers*.

It's totally fine to not make being in a relationship paramount, or even want one, but it sounds like you do want to be in a relationship but you're just tired of them turning out horribly. I think the first step should be cutting off your mom so she can't keep doing damage and work with a therapist to exorcise the ghostly copies of your parents living in the back of your mind and constantly coaching you on how to lower your standards just a *bit* more, but up with just a *little* more from a BF you should have peace'd a while ago. I'm a lot younger than you and in a much worse place financially and education-wise (although your example of success despite the bullshit is extremely encouraging), but because of the damage my dad did to my self-image I've reflexively side-stepped every chance at a relationship I've ever had and had an extremely hard time even forming casual friendships, so I know just how badly upbringing can fuck over someone when it comes to interpersonal relationships. I've gotten much better over time, but I think I'll need therapy to fully overcome the negative thoughts. If nothing else, it will help you feel a little better day to day."
155,"How did your boyfriend react? I think you should cut out your cousin, she doesn't seem to be adding anything positive to your life, but you also need to talk to your boyfriend because it seems like he didn't draw boundaries with her - he let her hang all over him right in front of you and ask multiple invasive questions.

159,"If you're on a break... then you're on a break.  You are both free entities until the break is cancelled, unless you agree otherwise.  Thus, he could have had sex with this girl and it's not cheating.

That doesn't mean he wasn't a jerk for bailing when things got a bit tough.  On the other hand, he has the right to know his limits.  There is nothing that says he *has* to stay with you.  

To be honest, the decent thing would have been to end the relationship, period.  The whole 'break' thing rarely works unless it's discussed in-depth and boundaries are placed.  Even then... I've read too many stories about misaligned assumptions or expectations.

I think this guys is unreliable and you are better off looking after yourself.  I'd also dial it back a bit with the girl he kissed.  If she's a friend she should have known to stay clear.

160,"Set a date for the discussion.  Make it far enough ahead that he can't have a prior engagement.  Give the date and time to him in writing.  You're going to have to do the heavy lifting here, so have an agenda.  List the points you want to discuss and possible solutions.  Give this to him ahead of time and encourage him to add to it.  For the meeting, brew a pot of coffee and have snacks.  Perhaps even a light lunch so there are no excuses to cut it short.  Schedule a length of time for the meeting and *don't go over*.  Set a follow up meeting if more needs to be discussed.  "
161,"It sounds like you're feeling a little uncomfortable with the situation, that you're not interested in pursing anything, but you're worried he might be? 

&gt;What are warning signs that I should be looking for in a situation like this?

There are a few to watch for

- inappropriate conversations. Does he ever talk about things that aren't just unrelated to your subject, but are rather... personal? Does he discuss anything around, for example, drug use or sexual activities? Do those kinds of subjects seem to come up often? (i.e. you're discussing music and going to concerts, and he talks about the time he went to this one festival and everyone got really high and there was an orgy...) If this happens, use a blunt but quick re-direct: ""Hey, that's really not what I'm here to talk about. Let's focus on [work related subject ]"". 

- physical contact. This one's a big warning sign. Casual touching, a hand on the arm or a touch on the shoulder, is often the first step in getting someone used to physical contact. That's great if you're dating and want to be respectful of another person's space, but it's really shitty if you have a working professional relationship that you're trying to convert to a sexual one. So watch out for physical contact. If he touches you in a casual, friendly way, I recommend sharply recoiling, making eye contact, and saying ""please don't touch me without my permission. At all. I do not like to be touched, and I do not want you to do that again."" Make it awkward, make it uncomfortable. If he does it again, repeat the speech, and add ""...if you cannot keep your hands to yourself, I'm going to talk to [ supervisor ]"".

- Isolation, or 'private time'. Do you meet with this person in a public or semi-public space? If it's in an office, is the door always open? Can you meet in public spaces where other people are present or pass through? Or does he want to meet 'in private' or away from campus? It's not always sinister to want to meet somewhere quiet and private, but if the pattern is to shift meetings from public spaces to private, and to limit the number of people who can observe you two interacting, that's... a little sketchy. The proper response here is to move the meetings back to official, campus locations with other people around. "
162,"Your daughter needs therapy, too! both private and family therapy. I feel so, so bad for her. You, as her mother, should have nipped this in the bud when the first incident at 6yo happened. You're enabling your daughter's abuse."
163,"I'm with your fiancee on this. She wants to marry *you*, and she doesn't want you to come with the baggage of your crazy ex.

First off, your ex is insane to ask for child support. Do not give her any money.

I can see why your fiancee would have a problem with you investing in the little girl. Say you have a child with your fiancee. Do you really think she'll approve of you spending money on another child that's not yours, instead of investing that money into your family?

If you decide to cut contact with the child of your ex, better do it soon, so she's young enough to not remember you."
164,??? I'm just looking for advice on how to proceed without looking like I overreacted to something that might just be in my head.

165,"I 99% (would say 100 but who can be ""that"" certain) get you.

My GF is like this.  She ""doesn't think about sex"" but if/when I initiate, she's completely down and has a good time.

For me, it helped to check my ego at the door so to speak.  Like ""Ok I'm not making her want to rip her clothes off and gush right there"", which honestly is a stupid idea - but as ""a guy"" that is how I liked to think about it - it was flawed.

But I also believe she loves me - a lot.  It's kindof like if she asks me to go shopping with her.  I don't really get into looking at clothes/fashion.  It doesn't interest me.  But if I focus on it, I can identify things I know she will like and then I can entertain myself picking out patterns/cuts/whatever that I know she might like.  I participate because I know it will matter to her.. and in the end I don't hate doing it - just if I never had to go shopping again, I'd like be totally cool with that too. 

I think of her views on sex to be the same.  For her own reason, she's not into it (that I won't delve into here).  But she does participate for me.  

I don't think this is ""pity sex"" (which is a concept that I HATE). 

She has also developed a ""habit"" of talking big at times.  So when she's around friends and they talk about ""we should all go to a male review"" she will be like ""oh yeah!"".  That hurt when I first heard her say that because effectively that is her finding enjoyment in another guy - but I'm very convinced (now) she's only putting on the show for others to not stand out as ""the freak who doesn't like guys"".  

Take a good look at how you feel about this - if you **want** to have a woman that just can't wait to rip your clothes off, this isn't the right relationship.  Your wife is being honest with you to help you determine that.  But if you can understand that she's committing to something that while not necessarily into, she can enjoy - well that is a positive act of love right there.  As a bonus, concerns about her having an affiar drop down to zero ;)"

If you have sleep apnea and don't wear the CPAP or oral device it's literally impossible to feel better. You can't. I guarantee you if he starts wearing it a chunk of these issues will just disappear because he won't be exhausted. "
173,"&gt; Being gay is not a choice.

And if it was, why would that be anyone else's business? We're asked to respect people's choice of religion, partner, career, number of children they choose to have, choice of car. Why should being gay be any different, regardless of if it's a choice or not?

Personally I think, as a pretty much 100% gay person, the whole ""It's not a choice"" argument is a red herring. The haters don't actually care if it's a choice or not. The best approach IMHO is one of basic respect for other people's life choices / needs, when those have literally no effect on anyone else."

179,"&gt; Because OP's wife interpreted something in this way doesn't mean that's how it was ""perversely"" taught.

I am going to try one more time, because this is important.

The chances that OP's wife misinterpreted a benign religious lesson is miniscule. What she is exhibiting is fear. That sort of fear does not happen by accident. It is instilled by ""teachers.""

You accuse me of stereotyping. I am telling you that there are zealots who pervert that wisdom of Jesus's teachings and actively cause harm. Zealots who have forgot what it means to love, preferring instead to indoctrinate from a place of fear.

Turn a blind eye to this reality in order to protect religious beliefs as a whole (which I never condemned) is shameful, because it allows the abuse to continue."

182,"&gt;  I live in the midwest, so I don't know if its a cultural thing. 

As a fellow midwesterner, I wouldn't call it cultural, but if you grew up on a farm surely you're familiar with people that think animals aren't worth anything more than their meat. And heck, my grandparents have told me all kinds of stories of having to slaughter their ""pet"" chicken or pig.  

Normally I would air on the side of ""You'll just have to roll your eyes and ignore it"", but do they say this *knowing* you're a vegetarian? Because if they know that you're morally opposed to eating animals and still making jokes about eating your pet, that just makes them assholes.  "

184,"I feel the need to emphasize that it's not just about your vagina. The cervix and UTERUS both need to heal and close up before you can have sex, safely. So you can have an easy, untraumatic delivery with no tearing or cutting or intervention at all, and STILL not be cleared for sex for 6 weeks of more because your uterus is basically a giant open wound."

188,"And/or, will be a huge circlejerk focused on validating how excellently rational the OP is instead of the fact that he's moaning HIS OWN CHILDREN aren't vaccinated or educated without lifting a finger to change that. 

Not to mention the fact that when they married, she was a Christian marrying another self-professed Christian, but he can't stand ""who she is now."" Ignoring that although she's changed, he's changed arguably more.

And u/beatybeatclapclap actually stated that he sees his wife as a MONSTROSITY due to the fact that she slacks at homeschooling little children, partially vaccinated a baby, likes oils, listens to dull music, goes on Facebook, and likes yoga pants.

You sound like a pretentious 15 year old OP. I'm sure your music taste is the best and all these plebs don't know what good music is. I'm sure the gaming you do is far superior to Facebook. I'm sure the skeptic blogs you read are much more highbrow than the mommy blogs. You may think your wife is a cliche but I assure you that you are just as much of a cliche, though more like a cliche of a 14 year old ""skeptic"" than a 32 year old one. Maybe it's because you came to that identity later in life.

Guess what your wife is probably bored to tears taking care of your offspring all day with little to no adult human interaction. She's probably depressed and finds it hard to get moving. She's probably very lonely and stuck in the same sort weird echo chamber that oh-so-rational skeptics get into, that most people who get most of their socializing online get into. How did you go from Christian to skeptic? I'm guessing it was a somewhat similar route to how your wife went from her former mindset to her current mindset: the echo-chambers that come with getting most of your socialization from the internet. 

Instead of judging her like you are so superior, maybe try to reconnect with her and do things that you both CURRENTLY enjoy. Not, try to change her to your superior ways. Not, try to ""get her interested"" in your superior taste. Find ONE thing that you both enjoy right now, and delve into it. Cooking. Gardening. Making art. Hiking. Biking. You play an instrument while she sings; make her maranatha songs really intricate and cool musically. There's got to be something.

She also needs to get out more and socialize in the real world. Maybe make an effort for the two of you to make outside friends TOGETHER, not ones that you think will be ""a good influence"" but ones that you both naturally click with. Maybe once you find your new current joint hobby, you can find other couples to do it with."

So what exactly is your concern? That he may not just be watching TV shows, because that he could also do in your apartment? Maybe he doesn't want to wake you. Or that the neighbours start gossiping? Or that he will really creep someone? That's unlikely, anyone who sees him obviously is also up at odd times, and they may pass a remark about why.

I get that you hate when he just disappears in the middle of the night. Maybe he can put a post-it on your night stand when he goes so you don't worry."

2. ""Nina, that food is not for you."" You can't stop her from being in the kitchen with you guys, but maybe if she is stopped from eating she will leave? Feel free to blatantly ignore her/not include her in the conversation as well.

3. Just ignore her. Don't respond. Ever.

4. Again, ignore her.

5. Hide any non-perishables in your room. If you can afford a mini-fridge, buy one. If not, consider keeping a cardboard box in your fridge and taping it shut. Also, if she really keeps it up, I wouldn't hesitate to call her parents. It might not do anything, but they kind of sound reasonable so far so maybe they would say something. They probably don't want her in their house, so maybe they would even pay you for the food she eats. If all else fails, keep as few perishables in the house fridge as possible to minimize your loss. It doesn't sound like she will go through the effort of actually cooking your raw ingredients, so try not to keep ""easy"" food in the fridge.

6. Keep all soap and toilet paper and other ""house"" items in your room. Locked. Tell your other room mate that you're sorry to do it that way but you can't afford to pay for both yours and Nina's consumables all the time. Let her know that if she's ever in a bind though, you'd be willing to help her out (since she's not home much she might forget that she was running low on TP or something). 

7. Just ignore it. Ask your friends to PLEASE ignore it as well. Ask them to simply not respond to anything Nina says that has to do with her body or clothing or physical appearance in general. That they have your permission to straight up ignore her. "
204,"This was a big issue for me in the past.  It really tainted my view of my partner to have them spew 45 minutes of negativity to me the first time I saw them *every single day*.

A few things that can help.  There can be a ""tell me some good things that happened today before you complain rule"".   There can be a ""no complaining for at least an hour"" rule.  The one I like best is the ""go straight to the gym from work and sweat it out first"" rule.  

While its important to express your feelings, expressing negativity on the same person all day every day will eventually train that person to view your time together negatively.  Don't let that happen."

212,"Oh FFS. Who gives a shit how or why? Rationalizing/justifying abuse gives women in abusive relationships a glimmer of hope that their partner isn't really an asshole but is instead a wounded individual, which guilts them into staying to nurture and comfort their abusers if they even for a moment entertain the idea of leaving. Let's stop making it all about them."

217,"That is kind of reasonable, but consider this, do you think anything significant would change in the next five years? Or eight? Or if you married him? If it is going to be a train-wreck break-up regardless, and if it has been going on for years, I do not see it getting better. 

Naturally I do not understand all of the circumstances surrounding the issue, but the way I see it with the information I have, if the break up is going to be bad anyways, the clever thing to do would be to save yourself from years of a bad relationship and get it over with earlier rather than later. 

And if you lose some friends out of it, well, yeah, that sucks, but the question you've got to ask yourself is would it suck more than spending the rest of your life with this man. Nobody likes to be made to look like the bad guy, but if it was my choice, I would take it over being stuck with a jerk. "
218,"Her reaction is massively out of proportion. Don't allow her hysterical response make you feel guilty - you have nothing to feel guilty about. I would encourage her to continue therapy, but I'd maybe let things blow over first before mentioning it. "
219,"This advice is spot-on.  I have a no-yelling boundary with every person I interact with, including my husband.  Even if we argue, we do not yell- we're adults and can use words to express our feelings, not the volume of our voice.

If yelling happens, I leave.  I do not tolerate being shouted out like a misbehaving animal, and neither should you."
220,"So he should tell her, ""Hey we started having sex four months into the relationship and have been having it for the last two year, but now that you don't want to have it after I exposed you to my religion, I no longer want you. Because let's be honest, I only wanted sex from you.""? Because that's basically what he'd be doing if he told her, either she continues having sex with him or he's dumping her.

If OP valued his relationship at all (beyond the sexual part of it) he'd tried to figure just how long she intends to be abstinence and even if she claimed it was until marriage, he should at least stick around to make sure it isn't a phase. 

However, if within hours of finding out he GF of 2 years has decided to try abstinence, his first instinct is to dump her ... all that does it prove to her that he just wants her for sex and/or pressures her into having sex she doesn't want."
221,So basically his parents have him by the reigns and he just sits around 'falling apart' for a living. What exactly do you get out of this relationship? 
222,You might want to edit your post with this extra bit of info.  From this new angle it totally seems like he's dating/wooing the other chick. Completely disrespectful of you. :/ 
223,"You're young, and you'll learn this stuff over time as well, but girl you need to listen to what people here are telling you, and listen to your other friends. Many of us here knows what kind of girl this is. Trust in what you hear or see, here and at school. This girl doesn't have friends for a reason. She's a petty, nasty and vindictive person that likes attention, even bad attention, and she looks down at people as beneath her.

She even said more or less that she didn't want you to do what she had done to you back to her! I mean Jesus! She KNEW she did something really mean to you that she didn't want to happen to herself! That's almost a bit sociopathic! Cut this girl off now before she does something worse to you. And whatever you do, do NOT let her find out why you miss school. I go to therapy too, and anxiety is a real pain, and there's no shame in what you struggle with, but this girl is vindictive and petty and would absolutely use this information against you if she could just to hurt you. Just stop talking to her, and make up excuses. Don't give her more of a reason to come after you. And make it clear to your family and friends that no information about you can in any way get back to her."
224,"Honestly, if you are ever going to be close with them, it will probably come much later. In your mid twenties...there's not really much you have in common with a 15 year old. No offense, but as a 20 something teenagers are mostly work to be around. They're children to me. 

You haven't had enough life experience and so: no common ground. 

Ultra sentimental bonding moments between siblings is something heavily promoted through media, but i don't think you should feel bad if it's not happening for you...because at the very least they are being normal 20-somethings. Also remember that siblings are individuals, and different individuals are compatible in different ways. So you can never expect a relationship with anyone to go a specific way. 

My brother is 8 years older than me, and i am 4 years older than my sister. Now that we're all in our twenties/thirties we get along really great. I have enough life experience that i can somewhat relate to him as an equal (and i have friends his age anyway, i get on with older people easily now more than ever). And with my sister, we're only really getting started on being good friends! 

I have no reason to think your brothers dislike you, and a good relationship with them at this stage means you don't do much together, but: they will be there in a moment if you ever need them. They are meant to be guidance and support at this stage, not BFFs

And don't take this as a sign you're immature for your age, or not cool enough to hang with older people. I think it goes the other way around for a lot of us: getting older makes it harder to relate to youth, so your siblings are perhaps just as culpable! 

In short: focus on being a fifteen year old with your own friends, focus on getting through your youth. Get to have you own experiences now and you'll all have plenty of things to talk about later. 

"
225,"It's yours.  All of it.  If they're willing to cut contact with your parents over this, then they are not good people.  WWID?  I'd cut contact with *them* and tell your parents why...they're using a 4 year old as a pawn over money."

233,"It sounds like borderline personality behavior. People who date borderlines tend to get involved with them repeatedly because they are attracted to strong personalities and the intensity of the chemistry at the beginning of the relationship. They also tend to be co-dependent types that had NPD or BPD parents that just fall into that pattern in a relationship.

You've seen the early signs of the push/pull dynamic now and you know how this degrades over time. If I were you, I would end the relationship now and get yourself into therapy immediately. You need to dissect what it is that makes you attracted to untreated BPD and work on it so that you can get into healthy relationships in the future.

BPDlovedones is a supportive sub that might help you recognize some of your patterns as well."
234,"&gt;I was like why!! Why would you do that.

Have you had sex, or if not, do you want to have sex?

Why do you like it, or why do you want to have it?

Well, guess what: It's the same for her.

Women are humans with biological drives and feelings just like yours. They're not Disney princesses.

Do you think enjoying sex makes someone a bad person? (Spoiler alert: No.)

Do you want to have a healthy, happy relationship with someone who enjoys having sex with you? (Spoiler alert: Yes)

So: You need to be with someone who enjoys sex and has a healthy attitude about it. Good thing your girlfriend does.

At your age, pretty much everyone you meet has probably had sex. It's healthy and normal. Stop making it out to be a big deal.

Focus on the relationship you have now instead of obsessing about the past. If you can't stop obsessing about the past: Therapy.

235,"Jesus Christ, usually when people leave a needy relationship everyone here tells the op that they need to ignore the calls. Now this 16 year old kid was supposed to read her mind through her texts? Lay off, he's not a horrible human being. He made a mistake. Yes he needs to own up to it now, but you don't need to continue insulting him. Anybody in his situation would be scared shitless. "
236,"Can I suggest that you try to win just the battle with getting them to use your name? People can be funny about pronouns and it could prove a sticking point but the thing is, once you win the battle of getting them to use your name, the pronouns will very likely fall into place without having to argue them into it, because it's natural for people to match their pronoun usage to the name gender and they probably won't be able to help themselves. I'm assuming you're using a feminine sounding name.

One thing which I'm sure you know already but which needs to be recognised in how you approach this is that you can't actually force them to use your name.

Here's what you *can* do, in order of escalation.

1. Ask them use your name.
2. Tell them to use your name.
3. Give them an ultimatum to use your name, or else cut them out.

You need to work your way through these options, in that order. 

By the time you give 2 a try, at that point, either they will get with the program, or they will continue not to. 

If they don't, at that point you then you have to ask yourself: what's more important to you? Them in your life, or them using your proper name and pronoun? Only you can decide that for yourself, but you need to make a decision so you know whether to proceed to step 3 - because if you go to step 3 and they still refuse, you're already made the choice to cut them out - you've told them as much already at that point. 

Be aware that you don't control the terms of it, if you do cut them out. They may never return. Or it might only last temporarily. You can't know. That's why you have to decide and commit to your decision about what to do if you get to step 3."
237,"I really like this response, thank you. The funny thing is, he has a nose that was broken due to MMA and now it is slightly crooked and I love that about him.

I can understand his misgivings about me turning out looking ""ugly"", or just not me anymore. I hadn't really put that into perspective since I was more frustrated with someone telling me ""no"" for years.

Lots of stuff to think about from your post and all appreciated."
238,"Here as another kid whose parents should have split. My parents have stuck it out, and I hope they can be happy, right now though I'm not speaking to them. I couldn't deal with the dysfunction. I know my parents want what's best for me, but I'm a product of their dynamic they've created and the only way I saw myself being happy was cutting myself off.

Do your kid a favor and be happy, it's the only way they'll learn to be. "
239,"Your relationship will be doomed if you lie to her.

You have a larger problem, though, which is that you refer to your ""thing for"" Janie as if it's a thing in the present tense, not the past. If you're still romantically/sexually interested in Janie you frankly have no business dating anyone; it's not fair to your girlfriend. Your girlfriend is *right* to be suspicious; she can probably tell you're interested in your friend. "
240,"just an FYI, people are downvoting you because everyone with a chronic illness have been asked about diets. I don't care though.

241,"I think you're being dramatic. Getting to know a SO's family is hard.

242,"some people just don't think about it. When I go on work trips I don't tell my boyfriend exactly how many men are going and if I'll be hanging out with them at all, because it's irrelevant and he trusts me.

245,"This is hard on both you! Some good advice I've seen is the higher libido partner making extra attempts to help the other partner destress. Whatever is piling up on her plate that's taking up her energy, can you assist with lightening her load a bit? Take her out and change the scenery up, that really helps clear the mind. Give her a massage after a long day, go on a picnic, get all the chores done etc. this will help her maybe start to desire sex more if she has less to worry about. If your attempts don't change anything I would recommend couples counseling to work through this. "
246,"Is she mad at the sex or the drugs?

Since your numbers are so close, she has no right to be mad at you about your number. If it's the drugs she's not okay with, that's a different story. Drug use is a turn off to a lot of people.

Your first step is to find out which of those two factors it is."
247,"I felt like you did for a long time. I looked in the mirror, and sometimes didn't recognise myself. I saw my friends and family moving through life being happy. Not always perfectly happy, things happen. But I often felt numb or cold inside, whereas other people seemed to have happy, or at least content as their default mood. The only time my numbness would crack would be after drinking a bottle of wine alone. Then I would feel agony, and devastated that I was incapable of enjoying life like other people do.

It all came to a head last NYE when I realized that I was never actually *happy*. Sure, I'd have fun with people, but then I'd go right back to feeling nothing. And I knew that wasn't right.

Apparently, it's a symptom of depression and anxiety. I started anti-depressants and I had some (free) counselling sessions, and I honestly feel a lot better now. I have good days, and I have not so good days, but I don't feel emotionally bereft any more.

The medication has helped immensely, and I'd strongly suggest that you look into it, as well as some counselling. Please consider it, you don't have to spend life closed off emotionally."
248,"I'd be pissed off if my partner was fucking someone for money behind my back, too. That doesn't make me asshole.

Nobody in this scenario is an asshole except for her. His issue isn't even their relationship, it's that she lied about it.

I mean, most people like to know if people are in a sexual relationship of any kind if they're considering having a sexual or romantic relationship with said person in question."
249,"Since honesty is off the table for privacy reasons, your options:

1. Keep putting it off

2. Vague truth

3. Lie

The benefit of 1 is that you don't have to explain it, and the flirting has stretched out for so long already that this might be possible. Unfortunately, it could easily come off as disinterest, so you'll have to weigh your options vs how important he is to you. If protecting your privacy is as important as you say, then you may have to be willing to risk letting him go. 

2 is the middle ground option: disclose only details you're comfortable with. Maybe it's ""I like you, but I can't start seeing you until ____ for personal reasons"" or maybe even ""I'm having surgery."" The problem with vagueness, however, is he will probably fill in the blanks with his own imagination, and imaginary reasons can sometimes be more off putting than the truth. This can also lead to further questions or him trying to pry it out of you, depending on his personality. Or he could be decent about it and respect your privacy...you know him better than we do. 

3 is probably the easiest, but also kind of... Well... I'm not a huge fan of lying, especially if you're interested in anything longterm with him. But for the sake of protecting medical privacy, a simple ""sex hurts because of a cyst, which I'm getting removed on X date"" or something in the same general area could be a way to get him to understand *generally* what's going on without knowing the actual details. If things get longterm and you felt comfortable enough to correct the lie in the future...well...I'm pretty sure I'd personally be forgiving of a partner lying to cover up a medical issue that was embarrassing for them, because that's not really my business anyway. (Exception: something like wart removal, because I'd really prefer STIs be disclosed in advance.) 

But again, I'm not a fan of lying, so I feel a little weird suggesting it. If honesty or options 1 or 2 above aren't feasible, though, then it's pretty much all you're left with. Overall, you're going to have to weigh how you feel about honesty/disclosure against how much you want to protect your privacy against how much you want to be with him.

Good luck! And good luck with the procedure, too. "
250,I feel bad for your mom. 
251,"I really don't see the issues here. I keep momentos from all my old relationships, and I don't give a shit if my partner does too. I'm sure I have some envelopes of pictures with multiples somewhere in my storage too.

It's as much a time capsule of your former self as it is a past relationship. I would feel so angry if someone asked me to edit my own history to delete it.  Every 5 years or so I find my box from my first boyfriend and remember all my awkwardness and the silly butterflies I felt about going to whatever movie stub I found. I chuckle, I move on. 

So what if it's stacks of pictures? Like, she probably hasn't sorted through that box in ages. Obviously if she's asking you to look in the area of that box she doesn't really remember its existence."

Yes, 100%.

259,"If she is feeling lonely or dissatisfied and filling her social void with mommy blogs and social networking, she is probably feeling pretty awful. I am the same age as your wife and I feel like a lot of women I know in our age group are going through this. It is kind of alarming really. A lot of my friends are turning into the ""super moms"" and obsess over health foods, organic labels, yoga pants, perfect parenting, and all that. It can be easy to get caught up in it. I ended up deleting all my social media accounts and limiting my internet social exposure to reddit just recently because I feel like the anonymity makes people less obsessed with appearances. I couldn't take watching all my friends go down that rabbit hole and trying to pull me in with them."
260,"Yes, this exactly!  He is seeing what he can get away with and also gauging your reaction.  I agree he is really dangerous!"
261,So he pulled the trickle truth on you. How are you to know anything he says now is the truth? Look into your heart. Do you think you can trust him again or will you always be wondering if he is lying or being honest? 
262,"I was in a situation like this and we just passed down the deposit responsibility. So new roommate would just pay a full $750 deposit to you.

263,This is correct. He's cheating on her and deserves no special courtesy on his birthday.
264,"It's not necessarily a fetish. Some people are just into androgyny, just like some people are into very masculine guys or feminine women. Such is the spectrum of human sexuality. 

That said, you need to decide whether you're okay with being thought of that way and playing it up. I find that most people want to have people attracted to them for the way they perceive themselves, so if you perceive yourself as a macho guy and she's telling you how hot and feminine you are, that could be an issue. Buuut... it sounds like you could be into it, or at least open to exploring it. So why the hell not? Try it out, and if it's not your thing then you don't have to continue. "
265,"&gt; You don't need to protect other random women from showing up once and not getting passed to.

She doesn't *need* to, but if she *wants* to that's great of her and shouldn't be discouraged."
266,"Oh come on. You're just picking fights. You used the same argument against unicorn, but not you're trying to argue back when someone else makes the exact same point- if you were making a legitimate point you'd agree with this comment, not pick yet another fight.

Indulging the comparison won't help. He's got to work through this anxiety on his own. You can be sympathetic but also let him know that dwelling on this is not a good thing."

274,"No means no. Too drunk means no. Asleep means no. Violating someone without theor permission is assault.

You orgasmed because it is a biological/physiological response, not because you enjoyed it

Go to the police, file a report. They will decide if they have enough to prosecute. Maybe tell them about the other girl who accused John. 

Go no contact with him. You don't have to explain anything to your mutual friends unless you want to. If they ask tell them as much or as little as you want. But remember, you were assaulted, you have nothing feel guilty over.

Try to find a support group, or therapy. 

"
275,"You should do whatever makes you happy, it's your life. 

Why is he so concerned, it's not his nose?! 

I'd get the surgery anyways and deal with him after. Maybe he wouldn't wind up caring after he sees how happy it makes you. If he does, then I would seriously question why he doesn't want to see his girlfriend happy, maybe he isn't as great as you think he is. Seems a bit controlling/selfish to me. "
276,That is exactly what I thought. It seems like he wanted to punish her by making her think that she never meant anything to him. I recall once reading a story on this sub from a guy who posted about discovering that his gf was cheating on him and he responded by doing pretty much the same thing as the fiancé in this post.

&gt; she added me on Snapchat through phone contacts. My first question: Does this mean anything? 

Naah, not necessarily.

&gt;  We pretty much just talked and caught up for 3 hours.

HOLY CRAP!

You talked for three hours and you still have doubts ?

&gt; TL;DR: there's a girl I know, who I never flirt with

Yes you do, just in an unconventional way. Talking with someone for three hours is way beyond flirting in silly ways like ""do you think this dress fits me well?""

&gt; Should I do it, 

Hell yes.

&gt; and how.

Don't overthink this.

290,"I respect this sentiment, as it seems in line with my brother's feelings on the issue, but I disagree with your opinion that she should not contact James again at least once. I think she needs to at least let him know that she is alive and well and thinking about him.

 I had stood by my father for over a decade throughout his addiction and even though it was helpless at times and wanted to give up on him, I stuck by him. I continued to accept him and I forgave him for many things he had done.

Everyone reacts differently. You don't know how James will react. It might sting to remember these things, but it will also soften things to know that she is doing better. He can make decisions from there. "

293,"Truthfully, no. It just wasn't my thing. But after we clicked so well I started considering it. I wish she was more upfront about it in her profilr but I understand why."
294,"Do you have inside intel? 

By that, I mean a mutual female friend? She can check the size and also tell you if your friend is planning to buy it.

Otherwise, don't worry about anything. Shop cashiers will not bat an eye; they really don't care about what people buy, and anyways men buy dresses for girlfriends *all* the time. If anything, they'll find it quite lovely. 

And as long as you get a gift receipt, there's no stress. I'd go for the size 10, if you don't have inside intel. 

This is a lovely idea and I'm sure she'll be over the moon. "
295,"What a pathetic, last-minute cover up. Some people will say anything and others will eat up anything. "
296,"YES, understanding the dative case in German is obnoxiously difficult, and it takes a decently elevated comprehension of linguistics in general to know it explicitly. 

But there's a vast difference between being able to understand the basics and communicate what's necessary, and START learning, and mastering a language both communicatively and academically. I mean, how many years did you spend in school, learning the grammar of your first language? And how many people still suck at it by college? 

Trying to make this guy put in the effort seems like beating one's skull against a wall, but it's just as silly to say that German is too complicated to bother learning. Or that he shouldn't have already started picking up some Spanish, which IS much easier to learn (and, as an American, he's very likely already heard a lot of, even if Castilian Spanish is really different from Latin American Spanish). "
297,"You haven't ruined anything for her. Your mothers challenges are not to be minimized but it is incredibly immature and petty of her to assign blame to you. She is not taking responsibility for her feelings or for how she deals with  situations. Do not let her make you feel guilty for what to me seems funny. I don't even see where the harm was, that haiku was pretty funny to me. What possible reaction could she have wished for from her therapist? I would imagine that she may in fact have non-platonic feelings for this person and is somehow projecting her fear of rejection onto you. Don't take it, if she chooses to remain upset that is not your fault nor concern. "
298,She could still be complimenting you on your appearance even if she doesn't experience sexual attraction.
299,Hi radical-orpheus. He did say that among other things which I tuned out because I was trying to ignore him. I'm relieved we're not married yet.
300,"&gt;Since my husband doesn't want me spending much on clothes (he almost never buys clothes for himself and doesn't see why I want to buy new trends) I really look forward to the holidays as a time I can get some fun stuff I can't ordinarily buy. To be clear, it's not like my husband doesn't ""let"" me shop, there's just a limit on it. I personally think it's a bit too restrictive but it's not a huge deal so I let it go.

I'm not sure how you and your husband organise the household finances, but this part of your post sounded alarmingly like my SO's brother and his wife. They established early on in their relationship that she is ""bad with money"" - I'm not sure if this is true or not, but I can tell you that *he* is incredibly stingy and doesn't believe in the tiniest bit of spending on new clothes, let alone actual luxuries. This is in spite of the fact that he comes from a wealthy family and, while not a huge earner, is never going to experience genuine hardship. As a result of her being ""bad with money"", all the finances now flow through him (she's a SAHM) - she doesn't have access to a joint account or even a reasonable allowance. It's abusive.

Fast forward a few years, and they are both miserable. She doesn't have enough money to spend on things most people would see as necessities, and has to go begging for him for every little thing (further proof, in his eyes, that she's not capable of living within her means). He is unhappy because he feels that there is this great burden on him as the single earner and the one responsible for the finances (even though he engineered the situation himself). They've had horrible screaming matches in front of the kids and the word ""divorce"" has come up a few times. Last I heard, they were ""trying to work it out"" - which I honestly think is the wrong idea.

I don't mean to be alarmist, especially as you haven't talked about the organisation of finances in your relationship more generally. But you need to be careful about letting him dictate the terms of spending to you like this. You have to be on the same page - and that means that he recognises that you should get to have new things occasionally, within reason and within your budget."
301,"90 euros? That's like $95 USD.

302,Sorry to lol but I'm loling at being a sahm with no housework is not full time. Should I just lock the toddlers in a closet for a few hours? They're alive all day so I need to supervise them all day.
303,"Definition of abuse:
""to treat with cruelty or violence, especially regularly or repeatedly.""
He is cruel to you on a regular basis. Emotional cruelty is a thing. The thing about abuse is that it's not always bad, so you might not realize it was abuse until you've exited the situation. 

Pulled a quote from your OP:

&gt; ""On the days when he hasn't yelled at me because I forgot to call the plumber or I let some food go bad in the fridge,""

The fact that he yelled at you most days for shit like that is emotional abuse on its own. 

Editing to add: I hope my comment doesn't come off too firm. I want to assert that while it's hard to come to terms with experiencing abuse, you are in no way responsible for his behavior, nor are you any less strong of a person for admitting you've been abused. I'm just a stranger on the internet, but I can't even begin to say how proud I am of you being so strong willed and having so much self respect and leaving a damaging relationship. You're doing really well for yourself and you will come out of this in a better place. "
304,"You both were too young and immature to be married, and got married for the wrong reasons.  You need to cut your losses and move on -- alone."
305,"Sure, and he can pay her for hours worked caring for their children. National average is $16 an hour, or $652 weekly for a live-in nanny. But at that ppint it's petty. No one said stop caring for the kids or the house, just stop doing things that directly benefit her husband. As in his clothes or dishes he creates or his meals."
306,"Your going to have to get a job. No ones going to take of you, you NEED to learn to take care of yourself. It's simply not possible to live like that. 

Gain some independence Otherwise your never going to be able to leave him. 

But maybe in the meantime seek out a shelter? That sounds like your only option. Even look into women's shelters specifically in order to feel more comfortable. When my mom was younger and in a similar situation there was a women's shelter that helped her escape. They even had therapists there and a team of people that helped her find a job and get on her feet. I'm not sure if they have something similar to that where your from but it's worth looking into. "
307,"&gt;""She does argue poorly though""

Well so does fucking George.  He's a judgmental asshole who seems to have terrible double standards. 

&gt;""And women forgive men for cheating a lot more, I think it's because men can't proove if the children she has are their own""

Where's his proof?  Why is he allowed to express an opinion without proof but you're not?   

Also, George just seems to ignore the number one rule of debate, and that's respect.  Whether or not you agree with someone, we should always respect the fact that they are entitled to their own opinion.  Honestly, how does George have a girlfriend?"
308,"See, I don't think you're doing it right. Because every wedding story you gave, you basically let her walk all over you. You let her do whatever the fuck she wanted without drawing boundaries or voicing any objections.

Stop caving. Be you. Be honest. Don't let her push you into doing anything you don't want to do."
309,I wouldn't even say slightly abusive. Dude is gaslighting the shit out of this poor girl. She has sex up to six times a week with him and that's not enough???? 
310,"Just avoid him, you can get friends who you aren't afraid will rape you.  "
311,"No.

He's being controlling. 

You said:

&gt;So I went out, texted him before saying I'll still be able to talk etc and went out.

He decided that it wasn't what *he* wanted, so he's pouting. 

Don't engage in it. 

Honestly, the biggest issue in relationships in general is how we engage in bullshit which empowers either party to continue said bullshit.

312,"So, because you didn't get the advice you wanted, we are all assholes and need therapy?  Damn.  You REALLY need therapy."
313,"Nope,  you shouldn't."
314,"I was honestly shocked to see that the daughter you're trying to protect from these people is 19. I was expecting her to be around 5 years old, still forming a moral compass, needing to be protected from unsavory people. Take that as you will. 

I think you're being ridiculous, frankly. *She's 19 years old.* Your girlfriend's daughter and her boyfriend are hardly the first lazy ""drains on society"" she's ever come upon, and even if they are, do you really have so little faith in your own parenting that you think that spending less than a day around them could actually have an impact on her?

I wouldn't blame your girlfriend if she ended the relationship over this. Not because you're refusing to bring your daughter along, but because of what your refusal says about your girlfriend. You're essentially saying that she did such a terrible job of raising her child that you dare not tarnish your own child by exposing her to the monster your girlfriend created. You're insulting both her parenting and her progeny, and whether or not that's fair (I lean towards unfair, by the way, considering the worst thing you can say about them is that they're lazy sneaker collectors...hardly the vile excuses for human beings I was expecting to read about), it's still *wildly* offensive to your girlfriend.

THE HORROR!!

(It wasn't even at another bank for God's sake. He didn't have a Swiss bank account.  OP read about it in their joint bank statement. She just never inquired before.)

It isn't that he shouldn't have his own savings for when shit hits the fan. The real question is why she hasn't done the same thing. 

My wife and I have multiple checking and savings accounts across 4 different financial institutions. Some are joint, some are in her name some are in mine. This arrangement is altogether normal. Your opinion is alarmist, unwarranted, and disconnected from the lived experiences of many others ITT. "

It may be the norm for two people who have high libidos, but not everyone has that and it varies throughout a relationship and as people age and due to birth controls and other medications. There's lots of factors that determine libido and it doesn't always amount to ""fucking like rabbits"", even three months after the wedding. "
319,"You don't need me to tell you that you have every right to be livid at his deal-breaker of a lie. How can you be sure that he didn't sleep with her since you cannot trust anything that comes out of his mouth?

My advice, leave this alone. It's going to end up being a disaster. Find a nice guy your age or at least someone not old enough to be your father. 

Sorry if that sounds harsh. "
329,"So I'm going to take a different tack than some of the other posters and not jump on your behavior. Instead, I'm going to point out that you seem to at first (genuinely) misunderstand a lot of the comments here, and need to ask for clarification (asking is good, btw!). More than tends to be normal. And in other instances, commenters have been unclear what you meant in some of your comments--like, they re left genuinely confused.

I don't know if English is your first language, but if it's indeed, it might be worth reflecting on if you have communication difficulties in a lot of areas in your life. If you do, it might be worth seeing perhaps a psychiatrist to rule out any language processing disorders, and then barring none, seeing a therapist to learn better communication habits. Take advantage of being at a university where these resources can be much easier to access than out in the real world!

This is not for them. They will not change and they will not apologize. This is for you, to get this off your chest and out of your heart so you can remove this from your life so you can focus on finding people who love and appreciate you for who you are.

I agree with you on this one. Everyone is allowed to have preferences or even insecurities. But the way she is going about it is not healthy at all.

&gt;It is not normal for a 23 year old guy to have had sex with over 45 people. Yes I said it, bring on the downvotes, I don't care.

I don't agree with you here. You need to define normal. Is it normal to have had 1 sexual partner? 5? 10? 44? I think that as long as you do it because it feels right and not just to add to the ""women I have slept with list"", it's perfectly okay.  

&gt;Regardless of what is preached by hookup culture, many/most women consider sex to be meaningful, a route to pair bonding, emotional intimacy, and an expression of love.

Many women feel this way and many don't. Exactly as for men. Some can sleep with people and don't feel attached or emotional bonding and others can't. 

&gt;This guy has demonstrated DOZENS of times that he is FAR outside the norm even for other men his age, of not seeing sex that way. Of seeing it as disposable. Of seeing the women he has had sex with as disposable.

The step between liking to have sex and to see women as disposable is HUGE. not sure we're you're getting this.


&gt;And, odds are, quite a few of those women he slept with DID emotionally bond with him from having sex, and then were hurt, even if he was upfront about what he wanted.

Way to victimise women. Like thy are so fragile that they can't handle a man wanting a casual encounter. Women at tinder who are looking for a hook up should just be ignored because they're surely to get attached. Poor women who can't separate there we feelings from just sex... get over your self.if he is clear about what he wants and the women are on board, there is nothing wrong. 


&gt;I think OP is normal. She might not be able to get past this. It might be better for them each to find a person with their same attitude to sex. 

It is not wrong for OP to see this as a deal breaker but they guy is not in the wrong for living his life as he see fit.

364,"I have an issue with this whole ""emotionally cheating"" idea when used in this situation.  The credit card thing was going way too far, but the BF could easily be one of those people who tries to help out his friends, even when it's detrimental to himself.  I've met many people like that.

The other stuff sounds like regular ""bro"" stuff.  ""I heard that you broke up with your girlfriend, mate.  How're you doing?""

""You need a place to stay cause you just got dumped or you dumped them?  Yeah, I guess you can crash for a night.""

I see stories on this subreddit where the BF's friend is super flirty and puts her head on his lap and such.  If that was the case, then I'd agree with the whole emotionally cheating thing.  Right now, it just seems like the BF is being WAY too devoted as a friend.  I agree that it's unimaginably stupid, but I don't see any cheating going on.

365,"I think 'terrorizing' might be a strong word to read into this post. 

I am fast angry/fast recovery like OP. We are the scary ones (if there is a scary one), not the other way around. No one likes to get their partner mad or upset, and if the fights are not constructive, it would be easy for both of them to indulge in conflict avoidant behaviors.

In this conversation they managed to argue about two different things: going out to get something for someone, and whether or not she can have coke. His reluctance wasn't going out to the store for his partner (maybe her hands were full with something)-- his reluctance was to spend *two* dollars on her. And they are married but he seems to pay for everything? He decides how money should be saved or spent? She wouldn't have asked for the coke if they were on board on how to manage their finances. 

There are a lot of layers here that reflect a deep lack of 'being on the same page'. That is why I don't see one sided terrorizing in it.


&gt;How did you and your ex avoid problems of defensiveness, aggression, and blame?  

* Self-reflection, drive to be personally accountable, --&gt; tamps down on defensiveness and blame 

* being logistically minded/focused on 'how', **rigorous** agreement on priorities. --&gt; tamps down on blame...this one was probably easier for us than most. He was a lawyer and I'm pedantic as hell, so it was easy to go over our agreements with a fine tooth comb to make sure we were compromising fairly and were well aligned by the time we finished problem solving. If  you and another person have deep and pervading disagreements, you just have to be very very **detail oriented** about how fair the compromise you are deciding on looks in different situations.

* Deep investment in body language reading --&gt; tamps down on the aggression. It is hard for people who get angry fast and are very comfortable with anger to wrap our heads around how destructive and silencing it can be for other people. My advice to OP is to watch his wife's body language very very carefully for distress cues he is probably currently missing. Not anger cues, but distress, misery, stress, sad, defeated. His wife might be very reserved and subtle in her body language so it may be easy for OP to miss them despite being a competent guy, especially if he is only looking for anger flags in the moments where he is angry.

* Deep investment in each other's emotional well being --&gt; brings the will to change."

389,"You're missing my point and assuming I'm disagreeing with literally everything you're saying. I don't disagree that alcohol is as damaging a substance as anything normally referred to as a ""hard"" drug - though I'd also like to point out that I'm personally in favour of drug legalisation and treating drug abuse as a health issue rather than a criminal one because I'm of the opinion that people can make decisions about their own body, including what they want to poison their body with. But that is entirely besides the point.

What I'm saying is that you getting nitpicky over this is overly pedantic and it isn't at all useful in this situation. I'm saying that, as much as ""drug addict"" isn't the wrong term, it's just not a very useful term when you're trying to say ""this person is addicted to alcohol"". Because we have a word for that, ""alcoholic"". Say ""drug addict"" and people hear ""addicted to meth, heroin, cocaine, etc"". Say ""alcoholic"" and people hear ""addicted to alcohol"". ""alcoholic"" is just a word that says ""a person addicted to alcohol"". That word existing is NOT why we view alcohol addiction as being fine. We view alcohol addiction as being fine because it's been the norm for LONG before ""alcoholism"" was even considered a thing. That's like saying we only view meth as a bad thing because of the existence of the word ""methhead"". 

ETA: expanded on a point a bit.
ETA #2: also you went sailing past what I meant when I used the words ""drugs like cocaine"" - if you'd considered the context for half a second, you'd realise that when I said ""drugs like cocaine"" that was a shorter way of saying ""drugs which are generally referred to as drugs in the general usage of the term drugs, such as cocaine"". I wasn't saying ""drugs like"" to compare the two, I was pointing out that ""drugs"" isn't generally understood instantly by the general population to refer to alcohol when it's said in normal conversation.

Actually he was planning to break up with me because he literally didn't have the time or energy for the relationship, but when we met up to talk about our relationship i beat him to it.

Plus, your boyfriend is also being an asshole. Instead of just breaking up with you, he's trying to make you be the bad guy and break up with *him*, I think. You should not worry about that, though, and either wait until he contacts you again and see what he says, or just break up with him now.

You're right on many levels that your boyfriend suddenly supporting the IRA and making racial comparisons is completely out of line and unacceptable. 

But he *has every right* to connect with the roots of his family. At some point (although I believe it's been removed) there were ways to get your Irish citizenship if you were a direct descendant. So while there's an Irish poster saying OP is annoying (true), **governments** have still encouraged ""coming back to home"" by enabling people who have direct Irish grandparents to get their citizenship (source: Citizensinformation.ie). 

My friend was raised in a Brazilian-Jewish family (in Canada) and only knew a bit of Portuguese. But it wasn't until she became a young adult that she actually became interested in it, visited Israel and Brazil and embraced that side of her family. Is she 'whitebread' in your eyes because she didn't grow up with her culture like you did?

If you want to dump him because he's being an ignorant, racist, jerk, do so. But don't insult him because he wants to connect with his roots. 

EDIT:

Adding because it's a really unfair perspective:

&gt;I'm Pakistani and have a strong connection with the culture even though I was raised in America because my parents were born &amp;amp; raised in Pakistan, I speak fluent Urdu, have visited family there many times, parents insisted we stay close to the culture

Just like him, *you had no control over how your parents chose to raise you*. You don't get to look down on your BF because your parents *chose* to fly you back home, *chose* to raise you in Urdu and *chose* to keep Pakistani culture in the household. His parents at some point *rejected* their Irish culture and he was raised in that environment. 

Kids typically don't have the power to demand that the household speak Gaelic and that they been flown to Ireland every couple of years.

It doesn't have to mean marriage, but it matters to know that you are valued enough in the relationship to have around.

Part of what makes OP uncomfortable is the very fact that she was likely testing the waters with her ex, meeting up with him behind OP's back to see if she can get him back or if he still has feelings for her. I bet you he doesn't, so now she's coming back to him as second choice. C'mon lady, get real here, it's so obvious how wrong this is on so many levels."

445,"Why put yourself in a situation where you may have to remove a scary man from your home where you have a newborn? 

OP, listen to your gut. Part of recovering from addiction is cutting out other addicts. It's hard to be clean when you're still surrounded by users so this man has a high chance of relapsing. Do not endanger your family to spare MIL's feelings. She's a big girl, she'll get over it."
446,The three of you knew each other before moving in together and Bethany was the odd one out. Could it be that she felt that she wasn't included at all throughout college? Her lack of contact with all of you (and facebook deleting stuff) seems to indicate that she has a problem with all three of you.
447,"No, legit sounds like it's coming from inside the woods and outside the house. "
448,"&gt; Since when did ""not telling your girlfriend"" become criteria for cheating? I didn't tell her what I got her for Christmas last year - is that cheating also?

Okay, now you're being intentionally obtuse. You know that's not what /u/leukk meant. You even admitted to not telling your girlfriend the nature of your long phone calls with this friend. It doesn't matter if they're only occasional sexually suggestive remarks. You wouldn't tell your girlfriend about them, would you?

And why not?

Can you really not put yourself in your girlfriend's shoes, and consider how she would feel about your interactions with your friend?"
449,"&gt; She is worried because I don't know the new hires and the manager. 

This is ridiculous. Amusement park workers live on site with people they don't know; I had female friends who worked there in high school. You're a 23 year old man, if they can do it, you can do it.

&gt; I will do everything for her, like fix her medication, take her to the doctors, go eat together, help her around the house. 

Does she actually need your help or are you just being talked into doing it for her? If she actually needs help, find someone else to help her. They also sell little pill containers so you can put together all her pills for the week. Look into groups where she can find some friends. If need be, look into hiring someone for these little things. 

Also, does your mom expect you to do this indefinitely? What are you going to do if you get married, start a family? You need to stop this dependency because it's not going to get better. You're an adult, look at how you phrased this question. She won't ""let"" you take this job? That's not healthy."
450,"I have to say,  she's a disgusting human being for thinking this is something people need to accept. It's harmful to an unborn baby, period. If she can't make that sacrifice,  she can't be a mother. "
451,"You guys need counseling.  Your communication strategies are beyond crap.  Just starting with the light fight:

1. It's not a pressing concern or a pre-existing commitment, yet you demanded he do it **right now** when clearly he was doing other stuff.

2. He passive aggressively stopped mid-task knowing it was going to tick you off.

3. You escalated the fight **again** rather than just letting things cool off, knowing he doesn't want to help (with this task that, again, wasn't particular important at the moment!).

Add to this the other stuff, like him lashing out and escalating in fights (""you're nothing without me"").  I'm shocked you two are still together.

You guys **have** to learn to disengage.  Not all minor disagreements (seriously: fucking christmas lights?  It's **November**) need to be fights.  You can both lose sometimes.  Try it.
"
452,"OR she could realize that his timeline (which, again, he's clear about and seems to be happy with) isn't working for her, and SHE can be the one to move on. I don't think that the burden is 100% on Mike to call this off. Not to sound callous, but he's getting exactly what he wants out of this situation: a relationship (presumably with Callie) that could evolve into marriage once he finishes his doctorate. Callie's the one who isn't. 

Look, I've been in Callie's shoes. I would have married my now-husband within two months of us dating if he'd asked. Instead, he had certain goals that he wanted to see us achieve before marriage. They were reasonable, and so I agreed to stay in a relationship with the aim of marriage once those goals were met. When my feelings changed about that timeline (I wanted to be married while my grandparents, who were in ailing health, were still living), I sat my husband down and explained that I wanted to be engaged by x and married by y, and why I wanted those things. He agreed, and we're now married. Had he said no, it would have been my choice to either continue in the relationship, knowing that the wedding would be happening on his timeline, or leave and seek out someone who could give me what I wanted. Either Callie has not been that explicit in her conversations with Mike (I want to be engaged by X date and married by Y date or else I feel like this relationship isn't going anywhere), or they *have* had that conversation, and Callie's still hanging on, thinking that she can get her boyfriend to change. Either way, it's not healthy."
453,"I feel like there is some key information that you're leaving out.  It's the part about the past history between the two of you.  I think that would help people give you better advice.

I have told my mom I needed space from her before and that I wasn't cutting her out of my life forever but I couldn't have contact with her for a while (it turned out to be a year) because she was hurting me too much.  She would call me once a month and leave a vm saying that she loved me no matter what, she was sorry and she just wanted me to know that and know that I could call her whenever I was ready.  

I will never forget that.  

I didn't realize how important it was then, but now I see that it was so major in beginning contact with her again.  She was demanding nothing of me which was the opposite of her normal self.  I have a great relationship with my mom now because she makes a huge effort (when she never did before) and I do too.  We have worked together to have a relationship.  We both made changes.  So I realize that letting your child know that you love them through it all is very important.  But then I think about it this way...

On the other side, I have cut my dad out of my life and this is a forever decision that I am at peace about.  It's much better this way.  But he doesn't even know.  He just expects me to always call him and because I stopped, we don't speak.  It's been years.  It's so weird but whatever.  I do know that if he tried to contact me, I would block that as vehemently as your daughter has.  The thing is, it has taken SO MUCH for me to get to the place that I literally CHOOSE to never speak to him again.  A lifetime of abuse.  He did SO much to me and still, I would do whatever I had to to have a relationship with him.  Obviously he took advantage of that.

Children almost always want to do as much as possible to gain their parents approval and love.  Getting to a place where you cut them out period, much less cutting them out the way your daughter has, is telling to me.

There is more to your story.  A lot more.

Because of how you glossed over that part of your explanation of your relationship with your daughter, it makes me wonder how altruistic your concern is for her.  If she is that hell-bent on keeping you out of her life, she doesn't want you in her life.  None of us can tell you what to do about that because none of us know the story because you left it all out.
You're really not even asking a question.  It seems like you already know everything that everyone is telling you.  It seems like maybe you just want commiseration, which is fine.  But you're not going to get the real answers you truly seek (probably not the ones that you want to hear though) without divulging a lot more."
454,"Yes, OP, you are definitely being unreasonable. How *dare* you expect him to commit fully to the relationship and put his shabby one-time affair behind him?! What is this, an adult relationship where one party has done significant damage to it and thus needs to prove he is willing to make things work?! 

Tut tut, OP, have a good, long hard think about what you've done. Insisting a grown man severs all ties to his affair partner and enabling you to feel secure in the relationship, what is the world coming to?!

(... I hope people realise the above was a joke)

But seriously, he sounds like a loser. If he can't understand why you don't want him to have contact with her, why bother continuing?"
455,"Next time don't describe your partner as 'nuts' and be more attentive to valid concerns instead of gaslighting them for it.

That said, this is definitely for the best, so your son doesn't have to see you in a dysfunctional relationship. Do you have other family to help you out during your financial hardship? Get off dating apps and social media and focus on finding a new job."
456,I think this comment is unnecessarily harsh in ways - telling OP that he's not willing to make sacrifices doesn't seem to take into account that the reasons he gave are more centered around his ability to care for his family and not wanting to uproot his wife and son.

458,"Nepotism most of the time isn't illegal in private businesses. There is nothing you can do, all you can do is be cordial around her and focus on your work. You have no legal remedy against her in regard to her actions. You really have no reason to care. You're all at will employees, focus on doing your work and not getting fired. "
459,"honestly , if he has so little self control n admits to it then you should report him. I fear he'd make his activity more subtle if you threaten to report him first, and although I usually advocate direct confrontarion first n foremost, this behavior could easily develop into something far more severe.

Report anonymously (or not) to whatever services are available (campus security, police). 

If you want to give him a chance for whatever reason I'd confront him asap and direct him to a counselor or someone to discuss this behavior. 

Just my two cents. "
460,"OK... I've had problems with anxiety and truly, I've done some stupid things as a result.  But when it gets to the level of interfering with your life like this, you've got to surrender to the need to get help.

If I were in your MIL's place I'd be pretty hurt.  I don't quite understand why your fiance cancelled the whole trip rather than putting her in a hotel, but I think that's something else therapy could help you with.  It can give you tools to navigate oncoming anxiety rather than shutting down.  ""Hey, having people in my home tends to set me off.  Could your mom get a hotel?""

And as for your MIL, I think you should a) sincerely apologize and b) proactively plan a visit with her, so that it isn't just words, you are taking concrete action to get to know her.  Lean on your fiance for help with this."
461,"This is a very common problem. I posted this in a similar thread the other day:

&gt;Outside of dating, how do you feel about your life? Usually when people have this level of clingy-ness, it's because the rest of their life is pretty limited (not that happy, not many friends, unfulfilled, etc). Then when they get into a relationship, they see a glimmer of hope and try to grab it with everything they have. I suspect the answer to your dating woes has nothing to do with dating at all. You should focus on having a very full, satisfying life outside of dating, and then let the dating be the cherry on top."
462,"The words above are good, but you HAVE to follow through.  You need to implement consequences when she ventures into forbidden territory.  My suggestion would be hanging up/walking away/otherwise ending the encounter any time she starts talking about stuff you've asked her not to talk about.  I did this with my mother and job searching and it worked pretty well.  You may want to tell her that you'll let her know when you're ready to discuss it with her, but still lay out boundaries.  Tell her that you want to talk, but you need her to be supportive, constructive, positive, etc., and then as above, end the conversation if she fixates on something that you've specifically asked her not to fixate on."
463,"That's good that it won't be a miserable thanksgiving! If it was going to be just Mom and her enablers, you'd be totally reasonable to be like ""sorry, not going if you're not going to stand up to her."" Seems like a reasonable price for BF to pay for the privilege of your company at family holidays. Something to keep in the back of your mind if it really doesn't get better in the future. "
464,There is zero good reasons to contact him. He's toxic and I'd definitly base an ultimatum on that. 
465,"Get some boxes and pack any shit up she has in your room,her new bed is the couch till you find somewhere new to live .You could ruin her romantic weekend away by texting her that you know shes cheating .You dont have to give any proof , just tell her your done with her cheating "
466,"You leave. Establish how long you have left on your lease and figure out if you can sublet or what, but you move a lot of your stuff out.

I get if you can't afford living on your own - check Craigslist for roommate options, check local sources for ads on getting a place you can split rent with someone.

Call and see if you can get a refund on the airline tickets. If you can't, see if you can move seats and go - but go solo, use it to have your own singles adventure where you enjoy it on your own. If you have accommodations, make sure you're not in the same room.

You break up and walk away. I'm not sure how you can say they didn't have sex if he's talking about ""kissing her nipples"" - clearly they're physically being sexual in some capacity.

**Leave and split up with your cheating partner**. Print out her texts and leave them behind when you go. She doesn't respect you and she's actively and constantly lying to you - she's not with family, she's with this dude and being intimate with him, all while keeping you unaware and deceived.

And don't worry about self-harm - call a friend or family member of hers if you're that concerned so she'll have someone aware of the situation who can keep an eye out for her, but her self-harming isn't a healthy reaction and isn't your responsibility."
467,"She could divorce him, though, and choose not to adopt a child with him. "
468,I don't think it's so bizarre - they're brothers who want to stay out of their feuding girlfriends.  Minimize drama and all that.  I'm not too surprised. 
469,"&gt; If we already had each others numbers and saw each other on a regular basis or didn't talk in the first place, I just deleted them.

This is you failing to acknowledge how deleting your roommates from social media would further strain an already strained relationship.


&gt; I acknowledge my wrongdoings and their feelings whenever I am confronted.

Here's your statements about the vaguebooking:

&gt; My shared posts aren’t directed at anyone

&gt; I guess you could say they seemed vague

&gt; I thought it was silly but I apologized anyways to be a bigger person

This isn't acknowledging your wrongdoings. Apologies don't work if the person giving them thinks they are being ""the bigger person"".

No point harping on about it any further though. That's my advice to you, stop causing drama and stop blaming other people for it."
470,"None of this is a common sense issue. Having been to Mexico, mosquitoes were a huge issue back in the day and it might have been taught to her from her parents. 

I also can't recall the name but also when there, I think the term for goosebumps was ""chicken skin"" so I see her using the goosechickens as a combo of the two languages. 

I think if you can't ask her why she calls things what she does or respect her thinking as her opinion, then you should break up. Lots of people think lots of things when they're young and if anything, her speaking her mind means she's at least thinking. 

"
471,"&gt; she still expects me to pay

Why?  You need to have a conversation with her and figure out how you can split costs when going out (i.e. the strategy - do you take turns paying, split the cheque, etc.), or stop going out.

I mean, it seems clear to me that she's taking advantage of you because you let her.  Which seems like a big red flag to me.  How else might she take advantage of you in the future?"
472,"This is important.

Also Op demand an STD from him and get on yourself. Full panel."
473,"You're young, and you've been married for 3 months. If you had been married many years/had kids/house/assets, my advice would be different to you because you would have a lot at stake and may want to stick it out and try therapy.

But 23 y/o F, married for 3 months, no kids? Get out while you can. You have plenty of time to invest in someone decent who isn't going to cheat on you and put you at risk of getting STDs. Don't waste your life trying to make this work."
474,That's actually another part of why this bothers me in fact. This game was touted as being for beginners. So let's say I did completely suck. How exactly could I possibly improve if NOBODY will interact with me?

"
476,"It's called **talking it out in person**. Drop the condescending shit, do not attempt to let her know how she's supposed to feel. Simply say why you aren't happy and that you want to leave, you can explain that. This letter will piss her off to no end and it's more of a ramble than anything concrete. "
477,"He doesn't want to build a life with you. If he doesn't want to really get serious after 8 years, let him go. "
478,"A 26 yr old cannot be in a serious relationship with a 17 yr old. And when you're 26 you'll understand why. 

You need to cut contact with her and focus on relationships with people around your age group for now. "
479,"I can't follow what you're saying at all. You think it should be universally accepted that a woman will say, ""I'm uninformed."" about politics? Not suggest she drinks? Avoid saying things like ""Golly!"" or ""Shuckins!"" when she stubs her toe, for fear of giving Grandmama the vapors? If his list of silly demands were universal, he wouldn't have to give them to his girlfriend.

I understand trying to make a good impression. I understand showing some deference to the in-laws. I even understand moderating one's behavior, somewhat, to make other people more comfortable. 

But when you've reached the point of ""acting fake"", no, that's not being agreeable. That's acting fake, and anyone who requires you to act fake to get along with is not actually socially compatible with you."

482,"My opinion is that you are expecting too much too fast. 

A week between a date when you just met someone is perfectly reasonable. I would just take it slow. Enjoy the date, don't worry about over analyzing why he doesn't want a date sooner. People are busy. "

484,"There is a huge difference between professional criticism and attacking someone verbally in their home.  As for your boyfriend, when you expressed your feelings he moved into name calling.

485,"Are they actually hanging out and texting outside of work, or are they just having friendly conversation with each other while they're working? 

In the former situation, you have every right to be mad. In the later situation, you have to realize that you're making her choose between a work environment where she has enjoyable chit chat and a work environment that's super awkward because she told off a coworker for hitting on her. "
486,"&gt; I told him, that the first rule of ANY open relationship has and always will be open communication and the fact that he was bringing this up before a trip that he barely mentioned to me was appalling.

Oh, I like you.

So, yes, open relationship is completely off the table.  The question here is, do you want to give T a chance to try and fix things, or does it seem like what he wants is so incompatible with what you want that it'd be better to just go ahead and end this?  If it's the latter, then you know what you have to do.  If it's the former, you're going to have to break your silence and talk to him.  Personally, I'd start by pointing out that it's no wonder the relationship feels stagnant when he's deliberately shutting you off from most of the exciting stuff in his life, and he either needs to work on integrating you into that before he decides that monogamy is the real stumbling block here, or he needs to figure out why he seems to associate you and the relationship with losing his freedom and whether that's fixable.  Or both.  Then see how receptive he is and take it from there."
487,"&gt; You just don't feel betrayed because she cheated on you with another girl. I bet you would feel upset if she kissed and felt up another guy.

...well yeah...OP said literally just that. For him, it makes a difference that it was a girl vs a guy. All that matters is how he is feeling about it really. It seems very much like he's not bothered and feels a bit guilty because the social norm would be to be totally crushed and he just isn't feeling that way so he's come here to try to work it out. If he's truly feeling the way he's expressed, he feels like he'll be able to trust her again and he should just be honest about the situation and they should sit down together to discuss boundaries."
488,"Twist, there weren't there at all."
489,I don't think he needed to be more insistent - the gf and friend should have listened to him saying no. You shouldn't have to be cajoled into a sexual situation and then look back and feel bad because you didn't put up more of a fight.

491,"Sometimes, it takes a really big event like this to realize that this is who he is. My ex didn't care about me at all but I always made excuses to myself ""he had a rough day"" ""the holidays are hard on him"" ""he's just blunt and direct"". 

It took a death in the family for me to begin to realize he just didn't give a fuck about my feelings and that was who he was as a person."
492,"When Jess was leaving for university her family and my parents where the only people that knew she was ill, my parents or Jess did not tell me about her illness until around 2 weeks before she passed on"
493,"Both, honestly. He's not being nice to you, but it sounds like he *is* treating you pretty much like he treats everyone else.

Since you don't like it, I would encourage you to approach him, and ask if he has a moment to talk seriously about something. Then tell him what sort to ""joking"" you find acceptable, and what you find unacceptable. Be clear, and don't let him turn it into a joke. You might also let him know that you're dealing with this on a personal level, because you don't want anyone to have to take official notice of it. 

Ideally, he will take you seriously, and agree to not joke with you in a way you find unacceptable. Maybe give him one or two slips, provided he *immediately* retracts and apologizes. 

If he either fails to take you seriously, or continues to encroach, then get someone official involved, and nail him to the wall."
494,"It sounds like you never really had any respect for her; I'm not surprised she feels uncomfortable being alone with you while you're angry. Importantly, not that I am assuming you've ever been physical. The language you use to talk about being broken up with, ""betrayal"" etc, and your desire to ""take control back"" and to make her feel like shit, and your immediate assumption that she's ""up to something,"" make me think that she is actually being pretty logical to not see you alone. Have you considered that you might have been (un)intentionally controlling or emotionally difficult for her?"
495,"Well with the way you talk about your girlfriends in terms of rating their attractiveness, comparing them, and comparing your ex to other women /fantasizing about other women because they are hotter than your girlfriend , you could very well be the problem . Also you are the common denominator. "
496,"&gt; For the past month she and I occasionally texted each other to touch base with regards to whether we had moved on etc.

That part was inappropriate and arguably emotional cheating.

Honestly? Encourage the gf to tell the truth, and you need to go no contact with this girl. You might end up losing your friend in the process, because instead of shutting the crush down, you two kept prodding at it for months, and for what goal? What could be gained from focusing on that crush other than to encourage it to get stronger?"
497,"What would you do, then? Just let your daughter laze around the house, spending your money, eating your food?

I would assume you've not played many party games if you think *that* was out of hand! I think there must be more going on here than you're letting on."

505,"I understand the fear of feeling like you will be mourning two people, but recognize that you already are: you're not only grieving the son you knew, but also the son he would have become. You will be mourning both of these people for many years to come, and that just plain fucking sucks. No other way to describe it.

Here's a second realization though: no matter how much you may fear additional pain, you're pretty much already at your lowest point or soon will be. Even though it feels like you have more to go, you're not really going to hurt more. This funeral is going to crush you no matter what - it's going to absolutely wreck you - and you can't stop it. So don't try to control things that you can't, because they won't make a difference anyway.

All you can do is grieve, and at some point look to your own future. And when you do, you will be infinitely thankful for the memories of others' about your son. You will be grateful for that small glimpse into the man you did not know, but who he had become. And it'll hurt, but it'll hurt regardless, and at least now you'll have some peace with the knowledge that he had grown. You'll be so thankful for the words his friends were able to share about him, knowing how much his loss affected not just you and your family, but all of them too.
"
506,"What outcome would you like from it? Her to be friends with you again or just closure?

If she treated you like this over something that's obviously small or you would have remembered, she will do it again. Is the drama worth it?"
507,"Guys, let's all be realistic here.

The guy most likely smelled the crazy and rebuffed her. After all, he moved away IN HIGH SCHOOL, *almost a decade ago*. Like, he ain't even remotely close to being the same person now as he was then. She's still ""rekindling"" in her own mind though, but I doubt he was all that receptive to her reunion. 

If the ""explanation"" he provided was, ""I love you dearly as well, I've thought about you as much as you creepily have been thinking about me these past 8 years, we are clearly soul-mates, let's live together now"", then I doubt she would have come back and said anything to OP. 
"
508,How did he know she was pregnant? 
509,"I don't know man, I think that's pretty fucking creepy.

Porn is one thing, but pictures of mutual friends is pretty weird to me, it's people he sees often I'm presuming and he probably fantasizes about sex with them...

While he's not cheating obviously, the behavior seems pretty strange. You're not doing anything wrong.

That's my opinion anyhow. Keep an eye out to see if he keeps to his promise to not hoard pictures again."
510,"&gt; Why would I immediately put myself into a shitty situation with someone else while I am perfectly fine on my own?

Preach it!

You get to define how much you know about your SO's finances at whatever stage of the relationship you think it's appropriate. This looks like a responsibility and honesty red flag to me. Who knows what he's blowing his money on, but after cancelling the trip, it doesn't sound like he blowing money on you."
511,"If her ""lifestyle"" is dependent on guilting your boyfriend into chopping firewood for her like it's pioneer times, then she does not ""have every right"" to continue it, disabled or not. It's simply not feasible, and it's coming at your expense."
512,"She's still seeing him, and is resentful that she is required to end it to be with you. I think, at this point, she's readying to end it with you. 

But we can't read her mind. The real issue: your self-esteem. Love doesn't mean being a doormat, disregarding any need for respect or honesty. You have to be willing to break your own heart sometimes. You have to be willing to take a stand when you are being lied to and disrespected. Whatever is happening, or whatever will happen, you've set a precedent that you can be disrespected and will still grovel for more. You deserve better than that, and need to demand better than that. "
513,"Wut? Are you saying if a parent was German, and the child had German citizenship but had never learned German, you wouldn't consider the child half-German?"
514,Completely agree. I'm sure after 5 months of sex we are passed the STD phase (but I got tested before having sex for the first time to make sure).
515,"Your text was a zinger. I understand why she is upset - she put herself in a vulnerable position and you shot her down. 

You need to approach her in a calm, level-headed manner (I know you said you explained it to her, but I really want to emphasize that you must be sincere). Apologize for being so harsh and explain that it wasn't your intent and that you realize that your message came across the wrong way and how you know now how it must have made her feel. 

If she doesn't get over it and won't accept your explanation...then it might not work out.  "
516,"Yeah, ignore all my other points. You clearly don't trust her. You treat her like a child. You're at the very least emotionally abusive but considering 

&gt; I wouldn't hurt her again

I am going to say physically abusive too. She definitely deserves better. "
517,"&gt;  I asked him to pick me up and he said he would be there in 30 minutes. I waited three hours until a guy offered to take me home in his car. The next morning he said he ""forgot"". When one hour went by and he wasn't there, I called him again at least 5 times and he didn't pick up the phone. 

Ok that should've been the one and only sign not to be with this guy!

519,"you need to do a purge.  get rid of his texts, pics, etc. so you can't sit there and mope over them.  if you feel you must apologize, send him a card but do not expect a response.  or even write the letter then burn it or something so you can get it all out.  but absolutely do not contact him.

then keep making yourself go out.  it sucks, but only time will help so until then you have to fake it until you make it."
520,"Sounds like he thinks emotions that aren't ""legitimate"" (caused by something he considers valid, and not lasting longer than is convenient for him) are toxic and should be treated with medication. "
521,"Ugh get rid of this guy already. 

You wouldn't participate in a threesome with another chick, to which his response was to bang her one-on-one instead? Mature. 

I'm bi but when discussing my sexuality with new partners I let them know upfront that my bisexuality is not for their personal entertainment unless I allow it to be. Don't be afraid to draw that boundary. Trying to be Cool Girl and saying you'll have threesomes when you don't really want to just brings wankers like your should-be-ex-boyfriend out of the woodwork. "
522,"Sure, but how is that my problem? That's like asking every woman to dress conservatively so guys don't assault them on the street. Maybe correct the guy's behaviour instead of blaming the girl."
523,"Do you think alcohol was a factor? Was she intoxicated when she called you? And now it's all blown out of proportion?

And have an honest look at the night. I believe you when you say you had zero intention of hitting on her husband. But sometimes not only can we be more outgoing while drinking but if the other members of the group are drunk, they may also misinterpret what is happening. This is just for you to sort of pull apart what happened and see if you can figure out WHY they're thinking this. It's their problem but it may give you some insight.

Ultimately, I'd tell your sister that you didn't hit on the dude and if he or his wife thinks otherwise that wasn't your intention. And that if he has a history of cheating, that's their issue to deal with and you don't want to be pulled into it. And leave it at that."
524,"&gt; Preston should be man enough to tell his girlfriend to stay home.

Why is it ""manly"" and courageous to desert your partner in life and party it up alone, because your friend's fiancee is a jerk?"
525,"Yeah it's a fair point, but I know plenty of people in their 50s that like hanging out with a wide variety of ages. It's not crazy far fetched or as dodgy as a 35 year old hanging out with 16 year olds. They're all adults. "
526,You are *so* overreacting. Leave your spouse over something so incredibly minor makes me think you are looking for an excuse to dump him. Making him sleep on the couch is seriously petty. Grow up OP
527,"They are bluffing. the minute they want gifts or help with the kid, they'll hit up your parents. "
528,"Eh, I don't know about that. He'd be shooting himself in the foot to fire her, but he shot himself in the foot by not hiring another employee or just taking seriously the fact that she was really going on vacation. This does not appear to be a man who is entirely smart about how he runs his business. I would not put it past him to fire her out of spite. She should be prepared for that possibility, imo. "
529,"ideas?  Move on. She's made it clear that she doesn't want a relationship with you.  No matter what you 'think', this is done.  You'll only look more creepy/stalker-ish, the more you try win her back.  "
530," His girlfriends problem isnt that they're models. She didn't seem to care about their existence at all UNTIL he told them that he used to sleep with one of them on a regular basis. That was when she got upset with him, because he his that information from her for so long instead of just telling her at the start who Rachel was."
531,"I'm not sure why everyone thinks she's being hypocritical and it's just because of how many people he's had sex with. There are two major issues here. One is drug use, meth and GHB are drugs many people would be incredibly uncomfortable with, and he never told her about that kind of drug use. 

Another issue is how he talked about the stripper and the word choice he used. I'm not saying he did anything wrong, but that phrasing makes it sound like consent was not on the table. It's also incredibly disrespectful and rude. 

It doesn't seem like she's upset about the number of women and is being a hypocrite, rather the way he talks about women and the drugs. "
532,"We actually have something like this. If one of us is uncomfortable and wants to leave a situation we'll scratch the inside of the other persons wrist.

I expressed my unhappiness a few times over the trip, but my boyfriend seemed more concerned with avoiding a temper tantrum by his brother than my comfort. It felt like everybody was walking on eggshells because of the threat of his brother blowing up. I don't want to deal with this, but nobody seems willing to stand up to him."
533,"Yep.. I have it too (severely), and it's torture. Headphones is what saves me. "
534,"A) OP is male. I know the headline says otherwise, but this tells me that you did not read the post (or my post, where I refer to him as a son) very carefully. For the record, though, I am not a man and I'm not your mate, buddy. Edit: I see that you're annoyed to have your assumptions about gender corrected. I'm so sorry, *ma'am.*

B) Sounds like you're doing precisely what I warned about- projecting your own bad experiences with addicts (your ex! no wonder you're so bitter!) onto OP. Before you do this with me, I am not an addict myself but I have had some pretty shitty experiences with addicts. I just have more empathy about the issue than you seem to. 

C) On r/relationships, we always get one side of the story. Anything else is an assumption. In your case, your assumptions contradict the information OP has given us. 

D) Sounds to me like he is better off without his family, and he has every right to be upset that his parents kicked him out when he was a *minor*. They could have gone to jail for doing that without finding a safe environment for OP to stay instead and arranging to pay child support. Child abandonment is a serious crime and a terrible failing. 

"
535,"First and foremost, stop letting him have sex with you when you are not turned on and he has no interest in taking the time to turn you on. Jesus what are you putting yourself through for this jackass?! "
536,"Just tell people the truth. You shouldn't have lied but plenty of people your age do all the time. I'm sure they'll understand, given how you didn't want to hurt someone's feelings.

Worse comes to worst, they all hate you and you find new friends once you're out of that school."

538,"Best comment here.  Just because someone is skeptical of the mainstream (which due to certain leaks, I think is justified), does not mean they are a mental case, as others in this discussion suggest.

The discussion with your spouse should be about forcing these beliefs on you, being self-righteous, and how these dynamics are hurting your relationship."
539,"Right, because it's SO EASY to just leave an abusive relationship. /s"
540,"Introvert =/= not social. Introversion/extraversion describes your preferred social interactions and what situations ""recharge your batteries"", not whether or not you're sociable."
541,"I mean, you are entitled to choose whomever you want to date, but yeah. This sounds really nitpicky. 

All of these things, albeit annoying, sound completely normal. I'm sure you do things that are just as annoying towards her. People aren't perfect! 

My advice, is to tell her about these issues, PLEASE, so these can be solved for the both of you. She probably doesn't even realize that she's doing it. "

544,"My dog (an adult dog we got from a rescue) doesn't like to go out in the rain, so my husband holds an umbrella over her when it's raining and she needs to go out. Get this: he holds the umbrella over her, not himself. He stands in the rain, holding the umbrella over the old dog, like he's Secret Service and she's the president or something.  

I think you should rehome that dog while it is still cute. You guys are going to raise her to be ill-disciplined. That kind of dog is very boisterous and needs a lot of exercise and training. You were right to think of getting an older dog, which would still be work but could fit better (I adopted an older dog from a breed which doesn't need very much exercise, only short walks needed, already house-trained, because that would fit my lifestyle, but her old owners had never taught her to walk on a leash or to sit on command, so we had some training to do)."
545,...she's attempted to leave a dead body on their property.  That's a pretty big impact.
546,"&gt; Let's be honest here. Did you go to his games and shout and cheer and congratulate him afterwards? Or were you grumpy and always wishing you weren't there? I'm not seeing any reason that he should feel grateful to you.
&gt; 

I'm introverted, so not the heart-on-her-sleeve and/or jumping-up-and-down-and-going -'rah rah rah' type no matter what context. I'd often read at the games because the sport wasn't my thing, but I would congratulate him after his games and mean it if he won or try and say something nice if he lost, because I was never that much of an asshole. Sure, I didn't want to be there......but not because I didn't care about him but because his sport was not my thing to watch and because I wanted to have my *own* opportunities. 

"
547,"I can see why it would be frustrating to see her ""reap the rewards"" of his success. But, don't romanticize everything she has. Sure, she probably has lots of money to spend now. But, is she in a quality marriage? Does your selfish brother treat her well? Is he faithful to her? 

Not the same situation, sure... but I will share with you my personal experience. I live in a pretty upper-income area (we live in the more modest section, but have a lot of super high-income friends). I have female friends whose husbands are millionaires several times over. They don't have to work, have all kinds of help around the house, designer everything, blah, blah, blah. But, in many cases, their marriages are crap. Their husbands give them tons of money yes, but they look down on them, don't speak nicely to them, treat them like their less than, aren't always faithful, etc. So, in the end, I'm not at all jealous of them. You couldn't pay me enough money to be married to a selfish asshole (and it kinda sounds like that's what your brother is). "
548,"1.  Your brothers are jerks.  Your mother needs to do more than just ""talk"" to them.  They need a solid punishment for doing that to a 4 year old.
2.  The sickness is not due to him being cold.  Hypothermia works like that.  Colds don't.  Children are melting pots of communicable diseases.  Being cold probably didn't do him any favors, but he was probably getting sick anyway.
3.  Your aunt is right to be angry at her nephews.  They owe her and Blake a sincere apology.
4.  Fluids and rest are the best thing for Blake right now."
549,"You don't have to argue with him. He's wrong. Don't roll in the mud with pigs, it will only get you dirty too."

552,"&gt;they always ruin relationships for me, whether it is because my dad is a drunk, my mom is mean, or that they live in filth

Any sane person would not want to be around your family.  They can only ruin your relationships if you bring them into your relationships.

You have a choice to make:  having contact with your dysfunctional family or having a healthy relationship with your SO."
553,"I know this will be mind bending for you, but my daughter bought her own phone when she was thirteen.  She worked and saved her money.

Your father owes you food, clothing, a safe place to live, an education, and to raise you to be a responsible adult.  Sounds like he's doing a fine job."
554,"Curious what their kill rate is, that's insane. How do they expect people to be able to afford the dog in the first place?"
555,"If she gave you an out like that, why did you ignore it? The fact that you stayed probably gave her hope that you wanted the kid too. "

558,"No, don't do that. This is your holiday and you are perfectly entitled to take it without making up some kind of bullshit excuse. Give him one final no and then stop answering your phone."
559,"Dude he's 4, he probably thought she was body slamming his dad."
560,He does know and doesn't really care. Our relationship is very strong and he's supportive of me. His opinion is that I should focus on being friends with Melissa and not try to let my personal feelings get in the way of our friendship. 
561,Why would you want to be with someone who you genuinely (and I'd say rightly) feel you can't count on to be there for you when you need him? 
562,"I think it's because OP specifically made a point of asking how to address the issue without ruining or causing strain on her relationship with the owners.  She said she wants things to stay on good terms, otherwise she wouldn't feel comfortable living there.

It also sounds like a more casual rental agreement where this lady is renting a fully furnished bedroom in her home and might not understand the  customary/legal rules of having a renter.

So people are suggesting more gentle ways OP could respond to resolve this. Otherwise, if she didn't care about keeping an amicable and comfortable relationship with them, I agree she could take a more straight forward approach.

I liked someone's suggestion to bring it up as a 'misunderstanding' about the rental agreement. That she expected the room would be treated like any other rental space - which is exclusively used by the renter only; and no one else, including the owner, would enter the room without prior notice and authorization.

That way OP is basically educating the owner about her rights as a renter in a friendly manner. And can further explain she's not comfortable renting the room under any other arrangements because complete and total privacy over her living space and belongings, whether she is there or not, is very important to her.

Approaching like the above or something similar probably gives her a better chance of getting her point across while staying on good terms. And if the owner doesn't agree or want that kind of arrangement, OP would probably want to move out. Because otherwise, she either accepts an arrangement she doesn't like in order to remain amicable or she pulls the legal card and forces the owner to adhere to renter laws, but with a strained relationship.
"
563,"You're describing the child and family scenario who is the ideal target of a child predator.

Have you considered calling CPS?


Edit: If your husband is in counseling, you need to contact his therapist or doctor regarding these behaviors."
564,"&gt;What 4 year old does not like bad ass things? 

He's 4 years old, and you literally showed him a monster. He reacted the way most little kids would when shown the picture of what literally looks like a monster. You didn't show him Pikachu or the hoard of cheerful looking Pokemon. 

Yes, you should apologize. You freaked him out, even if you didn't mean to. So suck it up and apologize. 
"
565,"If he likes seeing you in that, what makes you think he wouldn't want to see you in a bikini?"
566,A good portion of the female population are always bikini ready year round. 
567,"Yikes. Sounds like you need to make a separate post about distancing yourself from your controlling parents, but that's for another day. "
568,"I had a child to 'this guy' when I was just 17yo. I stayed with 'this guy' because he was willing to stay with me to 'do the right thing. A year after my son was born and I realised I was already a sole parent, so I told 'this guy' he was free to go. Funnily enough hearing that made him think he wanted to stay and be a good Dad but I stood my ground. It was too late and he'd ruined my self esteem. 

I'm now 20 years into a relationship/marriage (10 and 10) that is 1000 times better than what I tried to hold on to with 'that guy'. 

So don't be 'that girl' like I was. Cut your losses before you have too many pieces to pick up and before you're too weak to pick those pieces up on your own. You and your child will more than likely be better off without 'that guy'. 

And if he didn't want to be 'that guy' he should have kept his dick in his pants.  "

571,What would happen if he went to his manager asked for additional support such as a mentor or can he be honest enough to tell them he realizes this job is creating health issues and see if they can accommodate with another position?
572,"&gt; I feel like a lot of the time I defer to him on things because I have some health issues and he contributes more money and time into the household than I do, so I never want him to feel like I'm ungrateful for things by putting up too much of a fight when he wants something.

Just because you have health problems doesn't mean your contributions count less. You're supposed to be a team."
573,"&gt;Get that fucking child predator out of your life

I can't believe she is even questioning whether or not he deserves forgiveness.


&gt;He thought nothing would come of it and that he was not going to do that ever again...so basically it was an action he took on impulse that he thought would have no consequences because he thought everyone was asleep.

Disgusting. 

What's he going to do when he's alone and feeling ""impulsive"" with your own [future] children and doesn't think he'll be caught? Will they be too afraid to tell you too? Don't let him fucking get away with this with a ""sorry I didn't think I'd get caught""... I'd report his ass straight to the police. Done."
574,"Exactly, I would not send it in a bank envelope. No one really is saying that, but an abuser will want to know everything especially money to see if they are doing something with their money that could mean them having some sort of separation. "
575,"Don't do it. After my dad divorced my mom he moved into his new girlfriends house. He has chipped in like 40 grand on improvements for the place, and now they are on the rocks and she wants to kick him out. Told him he's a dumb shit, and if you do this without anything in your name or no guarantee that you will get paid back in the event you leave, you will be a dumb shit as well."
576,"Just because he's acting kind doesn't mean he actually is kind. If you don't have this kind of reaction with anyone else, I would listen to your gut. There may be things he is doing that you don't consciously see but are throwing up danger signals. Kind of like when you feel like someone's watching you, and then you do actually see someone staring. Listen to yourself.

The most charming and sweet people can also have a terrible dark side. Not saying everyone does, but many abusive and people with psychopathic tendencies can be perfectly charming and respected people in the community. That doesn't mean that they're always acting charming and sweet."
577,"You're engaged but he gives you this:

&gt; In the end, he essentially told me that a blood family Christmas was what he wanted as well, as my expectation to spend all holidays together was unrealistic - he works 30 hour call on both Thanksgiving and New Years this year so I will be spending these alone.
  
Let me put it this way: This year I'm having a Family Holiday for Thanksgiving; my boyfriend of three years, my best friend, her partner, and I will be cooking and laughing and playing games together. We *are* family. And there's no marriage, blood, or even betrothal between the lot of us.
  
If my parents told me that my boyfriend wasn't invited to Christmas because it was a Holiday for family, I'd tell them that I *am* going to spend it with my family, and then spend it with my boyfriend."
578,"&gt;I got shitfaced with my friends, called him, and said some awfully mean to him while he was high on speed.

&gt;he's really depressed due to taking too much drugs

This is not going to end well...."
579,"This might sound questionable to some people, but I'm not actually looking for a long-term relationship. We're talking about a date, not kids and marriage. Yes, some people would be thinking of the future at my age and dating exclusively to find a life partner, but that's not me. 

The argument of ""what would we tell the kids?"" just doesn't apply here. 

But yeah, there are plenty of men out there. I just haven't felt this sort of pull towards anyone in quite some time. "
580,"I honestly think its a mix of him being jealous and a little controlling and you and Fred not having good boundaries at all. If I had to put a% to it 30% on your BF and 70% on you and Fred. 

Your BF has already had a talk with you about scaling your relationship with Fred back and you two were able to work that out which is great. But now you are looking to put a new activity in there, which to him probably looks as an excuse to spend more time together now that the other activities are off the table. 

A lot of people wouldn't be happy with their SO texting a recent friend of the opposite sex more than anyone else and spending frequent time at the bar with them each week. Also I understand your at lunch vs after work debate but to your  BF it feels like your choosing fred over him. "
581,"&gt; I mean, I ran into the grocery store for 5 minutes the other week while he was in another state, but he was furious that I didn't tell him until the next day because I didn't think to ask him - when I was trying to get in and out and make it to dinner I was going to with my brother right after.

Did he apologize for that? Does he realize he's being unreasonable?"
582,"Dude, you have no idea how much hormonal birth control can fuck up your libido. I'm not talking about just being ""less horny""; it can utterly remove *any* inkling of interest in sex. It's different for everyone, but I'd give her some more credit."
583,"Wow. I'm really sorry that this happened to you. 

Best way really is to focus on yourself right now, your hobbies, your family. Hopefully you have some good friends around to cheer you up. Time may help but there's no sure fire ""way"" to get over something like that instantly. "
584,judge someone by the company they keep.
585,"Ok, are you allowed to go with him, did he invite you?

Like ill concede if he had before you two were dating, I just don't see the need to have while you are dating but that is just me."
586,"&gt; Her husband and I are buddies though, and I like the guy.

If your wife was cheating on you and your buddy knew, would you want to know?

---

My 2¢ tell him, but let your wife know that you are going to beforehand. If she starts to balk, just tell her that your moral compass (values, ethics, etc.) just can't let you stand by when a friend of yours is being treated like this. Listen to what she has to say, but ultimately let her know that you are going to do what you feel is right.

588,"Lol can't have your cake and eat it to. If I were you, I would give up. If I were her, I wouldn't touch you with a 10 foot pole."
589,Talk to him about and be very clear about your feelings. If it's a deal-breaker then 28 is a better time to work on a family than say 38.

And your sister is a horrible person, I would not speak to her for the rest of your LIFE for this. Holy fuck.  I thought I had a couple shitty family members, but she takes the cake. "
595,"Their relationship was down the toilet long before either child came into the picture. Your father hurt your brother back when he decided to be an absentee father, this has nothing to do with your sister and niece. "

597,"I know right? I feel like there is still an awful lot of age-ism towards women especially on Reddit. Like the minute women hit thirty HOOO SHIT, IT'S ALLLLL OVER.

Like, damn, I have a FEW good years left in me."
598,"A couple of points I want to make:

That was a shit way for them to treat you and I completely get why you're angry.

They probably didn't even notice they weren't passing to you.

They probably also though that just by you being there, they were being women-friendly. 

Being passive aggressive will just end up with them ignoring you and your message, probably calling you a whingy bitch in the process. 



It is NOT your job, as a woman, to educate them. However, if you feel you have the emotional energy to get into it, knowing you might be able to make a difference but also might be laughed out of the room, I would suggest sending them an email outlining what you've told us. You were excited to find an ultimate Frisbee group that you could attend, but were very disappointed to feel that yourself and the other women were very much sidelined. Give them your examples. Do not let your message sound angry, keep it incredibly reasonable,  otherwise they will sieze on your tone and that will be all they respond to. I know that's tone policing bullshit but sometimes it's necessary to argue with sexist people on their own terms.



It's entirely possible that they didn't know /notice what they were doing, and hopefully once it's pointed out to them they will change. But it's also possible that they just don't give a shit how you feel."
599,"I want to comment on the ""waiting until the daughter is 18"" thing. It always seems like a good idea, but you need to consider what you actually mean by that. Do you mean that as soon as she hits the age of 18, it's ok to divorce? If so, why? Or do you mean high school is over? If so, why? Or do you mean when she's independent and moved out? If so, what do you plan to do if she doesn't?

My aunt and uncle stayed together until ""the kids were 18"". Only at 18, the kids didn't move out. The kids are now 25ish and my aunt and uncle are only just beginning the process of splitting up. They should have split years ago, because all that's left is bitterness, but they tried to wait it out for the kids. It was wrong, because there is so much bitterness now, and has been for years, that they can't really co-parent at all."

I've had tenants/housemates who have reached hoarder level  filth in their rooms and when they have been told to sort it out they literally look at you with a blank stare and do not see a problem. To them it is normal.

If anything she is feeling insulted rather than embarrassed because she may genuinely think it wasn't that bad.  A general rule of thumb is to not text things like that to people. It is a very poor medium and the tone been taken in a way that offended her. "
601,"They're illegal here too, but doesn't mean there aren't still a lot of them.  ;) 

Given the Swedish thing here, I'm going to revise and say you need to have your texting game critiqued along with your profile. Too much too fast? 

 Stop being put off entirely by the women who aren't looking for anything. They answered, right? Maybe they're just waving off men looking for immediate rewards. They seem open to texting anyway if you keep it cool. And occasionally that can go someplace. All the way to one of those fikas or something. "

603,"I do not know what HH is, but yes she is absolutely fine and you are being crazy and jealous and controlling. You are throwing up red flags, and if she posted here I would warn her she is dating somebody who is showing warning signs of being controlling, which often leads to abuse, and would advise her to end the relationship. You are 100% in the wrong. She is not doing anything inappropriate."

605,"N'aw, hun. Don't beat yourself up over this too much. This story reminds me sooo much of my first time getting really drunk. My then-bf had to take care of me while I was puking the entire night also. It happens. You don't know it until you try it. Most everyone goes through it, that's how you learn. I know it's embarrassing, but it'll blow over.

It was bad timing, your bf being sick and all, but it wasn't something you did out of malice.

I propose: 

- A lovely home cooked meal, maybe soup because of BF being sick.

- Pick up his favourite movie/game and have a nice night in with it.

- Pamper him for that night, like make tea, rub shoulders etc.

- Go back to being good together."
606,"That is a conclusion you make, nothing to do with me or what I wrote."
607,"Personally, I think it's the same with the genders reversed. Harassment to me would involve a pattern of behavior. "
608,"Yeah, abusive pieces of shit rely on making you feel like you deserve it. Stand up and stay strong. You are worth so.much better and you will find it, I promise. But wasting time on someone like this only makes it take longer to find someone who deserves you. You should get really angry right now and stay angry until he is gone. "
609,"He sounds like a creep who preys on younger, insecure women "
610,"I'm kinda flabbergasted by some of the comments  insinuating you're some kinda abuser. You felt neglected and acted out as a teenager. That doesn't mean you can't do some serious damage, but did everyone forget suddenly what it was like to be a kid? You're not fully grown as a teen, and when you became an adult you learned better. Your brother still has the right to be upset regaurdless, but it doesn't make you an abuser. I read through all the comments and your course of action is fantastic. Just don't let anyone beat down your self worth or convince you that you are horrible. Becuase you actually sound quite pleasant."
611,"You need to tell your mom what happened. What she does with that information is on her, but she has the right to know what's going on. Do not confront your dad about it, it's not for you to handle. "
612,"100% right. Also, I think ""DaMacaroniJabroni"" is a funny nickname for a guy pointing out unnecessary machismo."
613,I know what happened.  he groomed her.  they got married when she was 21 and he was 32.  he's taught her that she has no value and deserves nothing.  
614,"What? How? 

If I really like you and your not interested why should I subject myself to being in so Called second place? 

You're childish in fact. You can't handle he doesn't want to be with you as a friend and it's fine you don't see him as a potential BF but still. "

616,"You need more empathy if you're going to deal with this problem. It is so problematic that you're using the term ""ghetto"". You also need to realize this is a culture clash, not a case where your gf is full on wrong. People who fight like she does can resolve things pretty well with other people who fight like she does. Yes, in an upper class, mostly white setting, she's going to have to figure out how to ""resolve conflicts"" the way upper class white people do. And honestly, I'm sure that even in upper class white settings old white guys can do the old white guy version of what your girlfriend did and get away with it. This sub is full of people having to deal with hostile, aggressive old white guys at work-- just to put it into perspective that your girlfriend's gender and race is absolutely flavoring your and other's perception of her behavior. But for women, and black women in particular, it is such a drag, and it's hard. I have a terrible temper that I have been learning to restrain all my life. It physically hurts when I'm angry and force myself to keep it in and resolve conflict the way that is expected of me. It's not an easy thing to do. So, if you really want to help your girlfriend, I suggest you think about what it's like in her shoes, view it as a cultural adjustment, and be her sounding board for her frustrations so she has a safe place to release tension."
617,Can you get a lock for your room? 
618,"Have you talked to her about how you feel? Calmly, outside a heated situation? If not, that would be your first step. Also counseling. 

It's possible this marriage can't be saved but it seems like a lot of resentment built up over a relatively short amount of time and oftentimes these issues can be resolved with honest communication and a mutual commitment to serve each other.

Divorce can be a physically, emotionally, and financially draining experience, and it is probably worthwhile to explore other avenues first. "

Wait a year, put her in treatment as soon as insurance kicks in, make sure she finds a therapist she connects with, and I promise that your situation will be totally different. 

Honestly, the fact that you're jumping right to divorce so quickly makes me think that her depression is just your excuse to get out of a marriage you're regretting for your own personal reasons. You don't seem to want to believe that this will change-- and with treatment, it will-- so why not be honest about why you want out?"

You know why you think you sound like a huge dick? It's because that's what a huge dick would do. I get being frugal about gifts, that's not a problem, but who gets upset about getting something from the person they love? "
626,"This is interesting, because we see this post a lot of this sub - just from your brother's perspective. 

If I were you, I wouldn't push it at all. Apologize to your brother in some way if you hope to mend the relationship in the future, I know he won't take your calls so maybe an email? Do not mention wanting to be invited to the wedding, that ship has sailed. Be understanding of his perspective, do not talk about how you thought you were ""past this"" or anything like that. Just express your disappointment at the state of your relationship and try to mend it in the future. 

And then, for your own well being, do not spend the holidays with your family. You are not the bad guy in your own story, you don't deserve to be treated like one by the people around you. "

630,"Computer screens have an ability to keep you awake - far more than books and talking to people, so it's not surprising this is happening.  Another thing - social interaction is actually really tiring.

Case in point - my SO.  He will regularly stay up til the wee small hours playing video games, but when we're out with friends he will start asking when we should head off home by 10pm.

So, some strategies:

* Bluntly tell him 'dude, you fall asleep as soon as you start talking to me, but will happily stay up til 2am on your laptop.  What's the deal?  How much sleep is he actually getting a night?
* Enforce that 'no gadgets in the bedroom' rule.  Seriously, if he wants to use his laptop he can get a desk or set it up at the kitchen table.
* He needs to come see you in the bedroom (without gadgets) and talk to you about whatever for 15 minutes.  He can do this by sitting on the edge of the bed or the pair of you sitting together, upright.  Alternatively, 'couple time' needs to happen soon after dinner.

3. Ignored her when she needed you, and you still don't understand why she's ignoring you? 

Fucking get a grip, and leave this girl the fuck alone. "
640,"I had an ex like this. His grandparents on both sides were Irish who came over to North West England. He was into Irish-American bands like Dropkick Murphys and wanted to get a clover tattoo.

He had a thing were he'd like to mold his personality around cool characters in TV and film because he didn't feel interesting enough just being himself and this was an extension of it. Maybe your boyfriend needs a hobby. Something to give him an identity that isn't about coincidence of lineage.

Another thing that may have helped my ex was seeing a quote that basically pointed out that it's pointless being proud of a nation. Be it in your history or where you were born. People should be proud of their own achievements and skills, not of where they or their ancestors slipped out of a vagina."

This will be harsh, but for what was done and damage you caused him you do not deserve closer at his expense. As you said it, he's happy so why are you trying to drag him back to the depth of hell he finally crawled out of. If it's to apologize, do it by supporting people living with what he went through. I understand the 12 steps but opening old wounds so you can feel better is one of the most selfish acts, when you know the pain that was caused. I've witnessed people go back to a very dark place after being contacted through a door they closed a long time ago. Just my opinion. "
660,"This is really unnecessary judgmental. I don't agree at *all* that she should have been off her parents' dime before she actually lived her own life as an autonomous human being. Money can go far but it does not extend to your vagina, I'm sorry. 

I really disagree with you focusing on how much she messed up (she didn't; we have no reason to believe this was anything other than a mistake) and the emphasis on how she hurt her parents.

You're actually telling her ""I'm a Muslim, and you hurt your parents by not living your life exactly how they wanted you to live it, and since you didn't warn them that you were going to be autonomous and since I assume they are still paying for your college/housing, you should feel bad.""

No."
661,"Thank you. 

There is a huge cultural aspect here as well, which can't be ignored. 

Aspects that go beyond the religion itself such as trying to dictate that a person marries into their same race and culture.

673,"You have every right to be angry. Your brother is the classic golden child, but unlike so many other similar stories, he didn't turn into a burnout loser, which makes it that much worse.

But it is important to recognize something. YOU didn't sacrifice anything. You didn't willingly give up ballet, your school and friends to make your dream happen. You didn't stop having birthdays, attend his practices and games, and move so he could be a better player.  Your brother has no reason to be grateful to you. The most you did was get out of the way without making a huge fuss about it. 

It was your parents that sacrificed everything for their son, including you. 

While I think it is understandable that you're angry at your brothers sense of entitlement and arrogance, I think you're wrong to be mad at him and jealous of his girlfriend. It is your parents who are the real shits here. It's their fault your brother is an arrogant git. And it's their fault that you had to give up so much to make their dreams for him come true. They are the ones who are supposed to care for you, to look after your needs, and nurture you into a strong, confident adult. It seems that you have become one, but in spite of them rather than because of them.

I'm sorry but I doubt your family will ever acknowledge your truth worth. I recommend counseling and distance from them. It is better to make a family that cares about you than to hold onto a natural family that doesn't."
674,"&gt; even if OP didn't have a job, that does not mean she is not contributing financially
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; that is exactly what it means

No, it's not. Where I live, a very good daycare is still well below the national average for childcare services. It's still $100 *per child.* So, if they live where I do, it would be $200 at a minimum every week for childcare, soon to be three. Oh, and childcare for babies is more expensive. She can expect to be paying, when the baby is born, about $300-$400 a week for childcare.

This is why you have a SAHM or a SAHD. Because it makes more sense financially to ""pay"" your SO to watch the children, rather than outsourcing it. If she was solely a SAHM, she should do the bulk of the housework between 9-5. **This doesn't mean she's the full time maid. It doesn't mean she's a full time nanny. It doesn't mean she's a full time cook.**

She isn't advancing through her career as quickly as she should. She is making a *huge* sacrifice for her husband and for her family. She will have, when all is said and done, put her career on hold for almost ten years. Being a SAHP does not mean you should be working 24/7."
675,"Your husband is abusive, not just because he choked you once, but he's also emotionally abusive. He wears you down, makes you think you're worthless, and makes you financially dependent on him, so you have nowhere to go. You need to leave, I would say by any means necessary. Take your SS and birth certificate. Go to a woman's shelter (they will not take away your kids, I don't know why you think so?), and ask for their guidance. If you use the internet to research ways to get out, do so in Incognito mode so he has no way to track you down. If you have any acquaintances, friendly neighbors, some cousins somewhere, anything, perhaps contacting them and asking if they can drive you to a shelter or let them crash in your place would be helpful. If you're not very far along the pregnancy, think about whether this is something you really want right now. Once you get yourself settled in your new place, look for low-cost or free legal aid to get a divorce from this piece of shit."

You have a problem and I really hope you deal with it.  You aren't showing any respect for her at all.  And no, you don't get a say.  If a person no longer wants to be in a relationship, they can end it and that's that.

The best thing you can do is come to terms with this and use it as a learning experience.  Getting that tattoo was your mistake.  Building your life around her was your mistake.  It's not fair for you to use those things against her.  You are both young (her especially) and I'm sorry but people change a lot between 18 and 25.

On the other hand - I had the life in Asia we'd always envisioned (and he has wanted from the day I met him); decent job, exciting life, lots of travel, lots of new things to discover... and it's ridiculously hard to recognize that while I want that more than ever and couldn't really care about the state of our car because anything will get us from A to B, all of a sudden he doesn't want that life *we* talked about anymore.

688,"Hey there, first post here. I wanted to share about a guy who is in my friend group, who is 28 to 30ish age. I was recently told he up till recently was a virgin and I don't believe he's ever had a real relationship. He just recently met someone. Anyways, this guy has great social skills. He is nerdy, but in the way that appeals to other nerds, and is obviously charming and intelligent. He's not ugly or amazingly looking but I'd say he's average and with his personality and being very witty and a kind conversationalist who makes others feel well he's quite attractive. I was surprised to hear he had had no romantic luck because it's certainly not because he couldn't. I find him a bit attractive myself...as to why he's had the luck he's had, I think he does well making friends with people then going after female friends who don't have attraction. He forms crushes easily and I think girls can feel him idealizing them. I think he either isn't aware of or chooses to ignore women who like him, because I've seen girls hit on him. There is nothing wrong with him, I just don't think his approach to relationships is working.

 My advice to you isn't to look for what's wrong with you (as long as you are clean, nice, and not overly desparate or passive aggressive/rude) becausw there is someone out there for you. Ugly people find love, socially awkward or shy people find love. If you have good social skills and are at least average looks with a job just relax and instead of looking for flaws in yourself, I say try changing and experimenting with your dating behavior. Try being flirty in different ways, try approaching someone you normally wouldn't, try nourishing a friendship and see if it becomes more, try asking a girl out less as a ""try it and see if it works"" style but develope feelings for someone first, try being less formal. Feel out how you behave and adapt. Maybe you come on like you'd ask any woman out, maybe you seem detached and forced, maybe you try to force romantic intentions on uninterested parties or at the wrong time, maybe go slower... change your approach not yourself"
689,What exactly is elopement? I tried googling but all I got was people running off and getting married secretly 
690,"&gt; (And he says my mom sounds like a loon and that I maybe should consider legal action, but I'm not sure.)

He's right. She's contacting your employment, trying to get you fired because you don't want children. That is not the work of a balanced mind. You need to start taking steps to protect yourself."
691,"Question 1: Were you looking for a job before this guy showed up? For reasons unrelated to either this person's behavior, or your discovery of his deception?

Question 2: What outcome(s) are you hoping for? Do you want your boss to give you a good reference? If this person left the company, would you stay, or continue to look for a new job?

Question 3: This 'con artist'... how is he at doing his job? Successful? Average? Flying under the radar? Because if he lied about what school he attended, and left some jobs of his resume, but he's meeting his targets and providing his deliverables... what does it matter? 


Finally, about the whole 'con artist' claim... 
&gt;His previous positions held and his education does not match up (different on resume than on LinkedIn, different schools and didn't attend others)

It's extremely common to have different things on one resume' than another. I don't mention the three months I worked for a start-up before being fired on any resume'. My LinkedIn includes a short stint with a consulting firm that I usually leave off resume's. The freelance writing work I did almost never goes on a resume' unless it's for another writing gig. So discrepancies alone aren't really nefarious. 

You said:
&gt; He is also making my life very difficult and is not a team player. In a nutshell, he knows I am ""onto him"".

That second sentence doesn't actually follow from the first. Unless there's more you're not telling us, it might just be that he doesn't like you, or doesn't get along with you, or has a difficult personality and isn't a team player. But **none** of those things means he's a con artist, or that he's being unpleasant with you because ""you're on to him!"" &lt; dun dun DUN! &gt;

However, if it's obvious to everyone in the office that you two don't get along, and you go to ownership with a claim that he's a ""con artist"", you'd better have your evidence pretty solid, beyond ""his resume and his LinkedIn don't match"". Because it's not so much ""women are seen, but not heard"" as it is ""cococrispy has a problem with Bob, and is looking for something to get him in trouble"". "
692,"I also broke up with an ex because of a lack of sex. It was just one reason, ultimately he was manipulative and abusive so that was the biggest reason I broke up with him, but we didn't have sex for about 6-7 months before I broke up with him. "
693,"Or maybe when he's at home he wants to relax and eat the way he wants to? I wouldn't feel comfortable at home if I had to constantly think of my wife and how she wants me to eat. 

If the conversation happens three times a week and it's that bothersome, well, I guess that's the end of it. Either take it or leave it, he's already made his decision. At least he's making a habit of thinking of her needs 4 out 7 days a week.

I think you may be jumping to conclusions with:

&gt;Next stops: lowered personal cleanliness and grooming, and watching TV while having sex.

Going nuclear? Doesn't sound like solid advice. It will certainly, however, resolve the issue and maybe not in the best way.

&gt; that's a bad red flag for the future

This assumes quite a bit about the relationship that we know nothing about."
694,"As a woman, it's my experience that a *lot* of men would be up for something if I expressed interest.  Enough that I wouldn't be able to function if I were trying to avoid all of them.

Luckily, men are not animals, and most will keep a respectful attitude and not pursue a woman who says that she doesn't want more.  I'm drawing an important distinction here between ""thinks she's fuckable"" (completely unavoidable) and ""trying to fuck her"" (which is inappropriate whether he is her boss, ex, or a complete stranger given that she has said she is not interested).

If the guy is not a harasser and OP is faithful and both of them have healthy boundaries, there should be no problem with them continuing to be friendly professional acquaintances.

As far as I am concerned, the real problem has been allowing this joke to continue.  BF should have mentioned that it bothered him, and it would have been considerate of OP to shut it down even without that prompting.  If they wanted to fuck the opportunity was already there; why would the norm of ""he's my boss"" stop them if ""I'm in an exclusive relationship"" wasn't enough?

Her lack of interest/consent is a completely insurmountable obstacle to this happening, so the discussion about him being her boss or being interested is not relevant."
695,If you didn't send the video to her entire family you are a much bigger man than me
696,"You shouldn't have gotten married if ""giving up all other women"" was such a problem for you. First mistake. "
697,"Stop lying. You knew exactly what you were doing. And if 'Justine' hadn't have sent this information to your girlfriend you never would have felt even slightly guilty about it, nor would have told her.

Your girlfriend may leave you. And she's well within her rights to. You fucked up and you can't make this right."
698,And...you didn't consider that bad credit a red flag? 
699,"Is it possible to switch schools? And as you said, please never act on it. "
700,"OP's husband may be pushing OP because he thinks he needs a socially engaged spouse to help his career. If that is the case he should be explicit about that with OP. If husband isn't worried about career but just wants OP to participate in social activities he enjoys he should back off. 

If husband thinks he needs a socially engaged spouse for his career, and OP can't be that they need to have a serious talk about priorities. If husband just thinks OP will stop being introverted if she ""tries"" harder he needs to be set straight. "
701,"If by ""everyone else"" you mean my sister and her friend, then yes. Again, my mom and boyfriend are with me here. In any case, I still don't see how any of this justifies the cheating accusation. Even if they do think I flirt without meaning to, how does that equate to having an affair with one of their husband's?"
702,"&gt; Yes, she has three daughters but my fiance says that's different because she doesn't have a son

WTF?"
703,Book yourself a place in a hotel. Either a luxury place where you can get delightfully scented massages (to erase the memory of cat piss) or a motel where you can bring your cat and dog. Tell him to fix his mess fast.
704,"OP certainly should have been more sensitive, but frankly if the bathroom was that bad, she embarrassed herself. And she knows it, that's why she's lashing out. "
705,"Like judge judy says, if you eat the steak, you pay for it. You can't eat the whole steak, then say it was the worst you ever had and refuse to pay for it. She owes you the money. She's clearly unstable to have had the bathroom in that condition and became unhinged when you threw it in her face, which you did. "
706,"As someone who is exactly the same way about things, this is good advice. If I say I like something, I like something and I'll use it when I'm ready and have a use for it. That might be tomorrow, it might be six months from now or even a year. If it is the latter, it doesn't mean I don't like the gift, it just means I'm still finishing my current book or don't have the time to read for leisure until I finish exams or my thesis, or I haven't been out anywhere the jewelry is suitable for."
707,"yeah we kind of can. you practically wrote an essay about Bella, and your gf is written in like a thorn in your side. 
regardless of what happens with Bella, break up with your gf. it's not fair to her"
708,"That was the impression I got.  He's just expressing it badly.  

He's frustrated that he isn't having success dating.  He's addressed all the other problems in his life by taking command and making changes, but he can't do that here because he doesn't know what he's doing wrong.  And that's frustrating.

"
709,Yea I thought he hinted at other issues as well. That proof of the photo shoot is the only reason she was upfront. 
710,"Wait these situations are *not comparable at all*! She has a job! This wasn't ""I married a bikini model and now I'm upset that she's modeling bikinis"". It sounds like you have a very tangentially related personal situation going on and you're trying to shoehorn in your anger at that situation onto this OP, honestly."
711,Thanksgiving weekend in sunny Minnesota. What a paradise destination!
712,"&gt;Since then, we have gone out to dinner together twice (over a span of 6 months), without a label on the relationship.

There was a label on the relationship it's called a friendship. She told you that from the get go. But for some reason you think you two are dating and just without a relationship label.

You're sleeping in different beds because you're friends. She told you want the plan was to hang out and get wasted with a friend. If you're still into her I guess you can just wait until she is drunk enough to not be that coherent but not unconscious so you can claim ""it's not rape because drunk people can consent too"" because I highly doubt anything you want to happen will do so when she is coherent and sober."
713,You said that since OP hasn't mentioned race we can't assume. You made the assumption that their race was contingent on whether or not they were legal or illegal residents. 
714,"You might as well just say, ""gtfo pls,"" because that's going to emotionally destroy her"
715,"&gt; I've walked off mid-play and been like 'I guess you need a penis to get passed to these days',

lol. love it!"
716,"I'm just outlining a possible scenario-

He has his eyes on another girl, so he comes to you and ends things.

He goes to this girl and asks her out, but she refuses.

He comes running back to you wagging his tail.

DO NOT get back with this person OP. Don't be his backup. There's only jealousy, pain and sadness in the future with him. Move on. There are a lot of men out there who won't ditch you at the first sign of trouble or greener pastures."
717,"&gt; I'm planning on telling my sister. 

What the fuck! It's bad enough that you snoop on your mother's personal notes but now you want to go and tell people about this invasion of privacy. Where are your boundaries and where is your respect? Why are you treating your mother, the woman who raised you, as if she were a child?

If you are actually concerned about her happiness then why don't you do something to help? Visit her more, invite her to visit you, that sort of stuff. That's much better than getting in your parents marriage.


"
718,"I can guarantee you would be happier...

Don't stay with him just because of time invested already in this relationship. By that definition two people should stay together regardless of how bad things get just because they've been together for 10 years or whatever. It's the sunken cost fallacy."
719,"She's trying to cheat you out of money, though. Living together might not be such a smart idea at this point."
720,"You'll find others in your shoes at r/raisedbynarcissists 

I am NC with my family because of abuse. It can take decades to overcome the effects of abuse and neglect. ((Hugs))"
721,"I just had a conversation with my fiancé's favourite aunt -- she's basically his second mum, since she raised him because both his parents had to work because they were poor. She doesn't speak any English, and I'm still working on speaking their language, but we made it work. She ended off the conversation with, ""Well, if you love fiancé, then I love you. Welcome to the family."" It was so sweet, and it made me tear up a little bit. I'm definitely feeling the love now! "
722,"Lol ""only buying one t8cket is a terrible way to win the lottery""

Becoming a professor is not a serious option. Kids go for it when they can throw everything at it, before they have other responsibilities. Op has a baby and can't afford to gamble like that."
723,I think he's just trying to ease his own conscience and I hope you ignore him. Sorry it hurts.
724,That is actually a perfect solution. 
725,"I just want to say I'm sorry to see people on here having a go at you for your boyfriend's actions. It's obvious you're trying to do what's best - while being abused yourself as well - and they should be ashamed of themselves. 

I'm in the UK, so I'm not sure if my advice is relevant to where you are, but woman's shelters may have connections with people that foster your pets until you can get sorted, would be worth asking them. Possibly have a look for charities that do it in your area too, or for no kill shelters? 

Good luck "
726,Has anyone called you out on your spices yet? 
727,"Three years later? Holy shit. She's completely batshit crazy. 

Definitely don't unblock her, she'll be on your fucking doorstep with a boiled bunny or something. "
728,"Right, but those things are extremely unlikely to harm the baby in a normal pregnancy. Unlikely enough that, while it is understandable to worry about it, it is not actually reasonable to avoid sex for this reason.  "
729,"""Why didn't she continue her commitment to *my* friends and family after we divorced???"""
730,I was really just commenting in case OP didn't know that it's actually pretty hard to harm a baby in utero by doing normal daily activities including sex.
731,Stop. Calling. Your Jack Ass Ex.
732,"""from day 1 he's made it very clear that he intends to be in a heterosexual relationship and wishes to be viewed as straight""

Most people don't even think about that stuff consciously and actually making a point to your partner that you want to be viewed as macho and super straight is totally weird. He has some serious issues. Unless he's willing to go to counseling or face these issues in one way or another, perhaps you two are not compatible.  "
733,"Sorry if this is blunt or sounds harsh (I don't mean it that way), but perhaps she didn't tell you because she knew you'd be like this? Maybe she felt that if she told you the situation, you'd over-think it or get angry/jealous or whatever and it would effectively ruin her trip. 
I mean, I'm not saying that she is right to actively hide something from you (if that is actually what's happening here), but I can appreciate how telling you, based on what you've shared here, might make things more awkward or frustrating for her. If you trust her, trust her. If you don't, try having a open dialogue about how you're feeling (just be careful that you aren't constantly making mountains out of molehills with her, or she's bound to just get fed up and you'll push her away.)"
734,"&gt; I've tried every approach from being nice, to being harsh, to being logical

Have you tried simply withdrawing?  ""Mum, I've said that I'd prefer you not to bring this up, and I find it upsetting that you're don't respect my wishes.  So I'm going to go now - take care!"" *hangs up phone/leaves room*

The thing about boundaries is that you have to be prepared to both state them and enforce them."
735,"She didn't tell me right away, but she was definitely smelling like alcohol. I think I'm breaking up with her because I can't stand this. "
736,"When accompanied by a lie to enable the 'coffee with ex'...yes cheating every time.  Did a dick go into a vagina?  I have no idea, nor should it matter, the cheating is having an emotional connection with someone so strong that you'd lie to your partner in a direct and boldfaced way."
737,"In the US and Canada, there's generally one main dish and a side dish for dinner. In many other countries, there are multiple dishes to choose from, so if you don't like one thing, there's something else to eat. In addition, unless you're in a place where food is scarce (which is a different discussion), parents the world over take their children's likes and dislikes into consideration when making dinner. "
738,"&gt; the guy's family says that my wife used excessive force 

Your wife has taken martial arts courses, but she's not a professional (I'm assuming). How is she supposed to know *exactly* how much force to apply? And you said he died from the fall. So it doesn't matter how much force she applied, because his head would have hit the ground with the same force.

She was fighting for her life. If she didn't defend herself, the guy could have easily stabbed her and your son would be growing up without a mother.

She needs to stay off social media."
739,"Yeah nah. Friends who think they suffer near or just as much as someone who actually goes through something are just looking to be the centre of attention, even if its something awful. She doesn't need friends like that. Theres plenty of people who aren't going to be shitty friends that think in the time of something horrible, they need to unload on someone more than respect the privacy and friendship between the person that told them. People like that are just an emotional waste space, its exhausting. 
I've had terrible things happen to friends around me, but i wouldn't shit all over the friendship just to ""vent"" about it, and to a crazy religious nutter at that. Theres such a thing as therapists. I bet she didnt feel so bad that she was willing to fork out money to discuss it. She just can't handle something bad happened to someone and is taking the attention off her little pompous self."
740,"Ugh...those texts aren't great. I can't imagine a situation where it's ok for an 11 year old to be texting a 30 yr old?  And, did her parents know they went to the mall?"
741,I think she got rejected again and that's why she came back early. She's going to be running after him over and over and it still will never be enough. I think you need to break free from the drama. 
742,"&gt;You're misunderstanding. 

No, **YOU** are the one who isn't grasping the severity of the situation.  Right now you really suck as a mother.  You're failing to protect your daughter from your husband's bullshit.

Stop making excuses for your husband and face up to the fact that he's scarring your daughter for life with his screaming tantrums.


"
743,"She doesn't want to start relying on your help when you say yourself you might just bail.

744,"He sounds a bit like he could be on the autism spectrum. I don't know him, of course, but he seems unaware of social cues to some degree. Have you tried just pointing out to him that he talks a lot? He probably is not aware of it, even if he doesn't have any kind of disorder. Try saying something to him like ""while I am interested in hearing your side of things, I feel like I don't *ever* get a chance to say what I'm thinking. I know you're a nice guy and a great friend, but sometimes I can't get a word in edgewise!"" "
745,"He can go over her head to the pastor and have the pastor ""counsel"" her to obey him."
746,"Lol nah. It's not a question of her being a supervisor rather than coworker. I have an 'ethnic' name, and there is absolutely no way I would be down with my coworkers calling me something else because they're too lazy to learn my name. It's ok if it takes a couple tries.

OP is an adult. OP is a college graduate. He can fucking make an effort and say the name. It's insulting, regardless of professional position, for someone to say ""oh that's too hard for me, I'm just gonna unilaterally pick something easier""

OP, I know you see this as an issue of pragmatism, but people's identities are closely tied to their names. She didn't embarrass you. You did something kinda shitty. By accident, but shitty nevertheless."
747,"Oh my gosh I really hope you read this because I was literally in this exact position 6 years ago. I was 22 and he was 31 when we met and we were together for 6 years. He used to tell me that he needed me to be more like a robot and show emotions less. I was horribly upset because I had to put my childhood cat down and he freaked out saying ""I don't understand why you're so upset over a cat and you're really affecting me right now"". I eventually got up the courage to leave and afterwards i realized how controlling and manipulative this was. Always instructing me to "" control my emotions"" and telling me how to dress when I was around his friends (he hated when I wore anything that wasn't tight. No loose shirts were okay.)

Okay so that was me...... If I was you I would leave right now before I wasted one more year on someone controlling. Just go. Go now. Be free. I'm now married to the kindest man who, when I get upset, makes me tea and asks how he can help. You can marry one of these too. 

PM me if you would like.

748,Don't go.  Not if you're going to spend the whole evening hung up on her.  You can work on finding some other way to meet girls who are available.

Not sure which of you is asking the other out on dates or to dinner, but just start suggesting you eat at home. If she says she doesn't want to, then say ""I don't have the budget to eat out tonight. If you can pick up the tab then great, let's go. Otherwise, let's have dinner in."" 

Decide your boundaries and what you are comfortable with. And then just starting acting like it is the norm. She'll either start following and change her habits, or she'll get mad (and thus be forced to actually discuss the issue). "
751,"No guy takes that long to actually poop, most of the time is spent on the phone or enjoying your only moment of solitude all day."
752,"OP, I think there is a difference with being emotional (showing emotions easily and not hiding them) and being sensitive.

&gt;  The very first thing he says when he gets home is, ""Ewe, it smells weird in here!"". I had been cooking for him to only get insulted and because of that I broke down and started to cry.

YOU took this as a personal attack. You said you were insulted...but he wasnt insulting you, or the food...he made a statement about it smelling weird. By taking that as a personal attack, and crying...he likely felt obligated to comfort you. To do the emotional decompressing for you. You were upset that you put in effort and hardwork and he commented that he didnt like the SMELL. From your statement, it doesnt sound like he was saying you are a bad cook, or that he didnt appreciate the meal, just that it didnt smell good to him.

&gt; Anyways, the next night, we're watching 'Everest' and I start to cry again, because one of the characters had died

That ^^^ is being emotional, which is different then being sensitive. Seeing someone die in a film created an emotional response, in this case, crying. 

The way I see it, is he is blending your emotional responses with your over sensitive responses, but so are you. If these responses all seem the same to him, i.e., you crying over everything...he is not distinguishing between a healthy emotional response versus you getting upset with his words hurting your feelings. However, if you get upset over his statements easily and also display high levels of emotions in other avenues it may feel overwhelming to him.

I have been with girls that react/respond much in the same fashion you just described...and while I am a compassionate partner, there are times (for me) when I found it to be exhausting to feel like I was apologizing for everything I did or said. When it feels like you are damned if you do, or damned if you dont...its challenging and grinds on you.

I would make the suggestion that you need to communicate with him, when you are not upset...so you can approach it with a clear head. Sit down with him, and let him know that the way he says things can upset you/hurt your feelings. Be aware, you may have to face some truths about how he feels as well...but dont let the conversation get shut down because you cant handle what he is saying (as I would imagine, if he communicates back about how he feels...you may not like what you hear). It may also make him uncomfortable to talk about, because if he feels you are sensitive, he may want to avoid conflict all together.

I say these things as I have had to deal with similar situations. Communicating these things will at least put it out on the table so you guys can work on it...as opposed to just sweeping it under the rug. 

last note: Your feelings are are your own...and it is not right for him to say you shouldnt feel a certain way. Your feelings are valid."
753,"When you say ""not PC about saying things"" what does that mean exactly? Because sometimes it means ""is pretty blunt"" and other times it's used to describe people that are actually racist/bigoted/rude."
754,"Just to be clear, the gf was paying to watch someone on cam?"
755,"&gt;Did I ruin the relationship by asking the wrong question here?

Dude, at the end of the date it was mutually decided that this was going nowhere. Asking to be fuck buddies most definitely cemented her decision not to date immature, tactless boys."
756,"This is insane.  Are you literally not allowed to be friends with anyone but him?  Is that the only way he will ever be secure?  

This sounds completely exhausting for you.  

I think you need to get into couple's therapy ASAP and see if you can work this out.  He has MAJOR trust issues that he needs to get over.  If not, then maybe he isn't mature enough to be in an adult relationship.

Was he like this the whole time you were dating?  Why have you put up with this for so long?"
757,"No. If it's really about him, write him a letter, and then leave it up to *him* to initiate any closer contact.  For you to do so is to impose, and makes it about you, not about him.  "
758,"That's true. My question is, though, how does this person know these mommy bloggers are ignoring their (overweight) kids? What's she basing this stereotype on? Did she know someone once who did that, or does she think it's impossible to spend an hour here or there blogging without neglecting your kids? "
759,"As someone who deals with a boyfriend's bigoted family, I can you tell you that it does indeed create a lot of stress. I'm sure she understands these aren't your views. However, her free time is sacred, and I wouldn't want to spend it with people (especially family) who share those views either. Your girlfriend has a right to be upset. You have a responsibility to respect that right. There isn't a need to be divisive about it (i.e. pick sides). However, a simple conversation will do. With the ugliness that came out of the recent election, a lot of hatred has come to light and it's sadly coming from our very own neighbors, teachers, colleagues and sometimes even family. Comfort her, love on her, and be on her team. I wish you the best and I think it's a fantastic thing that you've reached out :) "
760,"It's a family business, though.  A family business that OP could potentially be inheriting/running at some point as Dad ages.

I think that makes a difference, and I think he should deal or break up with her.  "
761,Possibly illegal. We don't have enough information to know because we have no jurisdiction. A bad idea in every jurisdiction. Be blessed.
762,"This is such completely inappropriate behavior on your part. Why in your apology for insulting her would you bring up fucking a girl in college? You need to back all the way off and keep contact with this woman 100% professional at all times. 

EDIT: Also back the fuck up for your boyfriend's sake, this is so disrespectful to him."

That's a pretty clever plan.

Edited to unthan my then."
767,"&gt;she really doesn't forget about things like this and i'm worried that she's not going to ever really forgive me.


Forgiveness and forgetting are two different things.


If you girlfriend (or anyone who's been wronged, really) wants to continue with the relationship, she has to be able to genuinely forgive. It's fine if that takes a little time, it's fine if there are some conditions attached (such as you not lying again, etc), but overall for any relationship to move forward after any conflict, genuine forgiveness is necessary.


Forgetting is a whole other story. When someone messes up once, it's a mistake. When there's a pattern, then it's an sign you might be in an unhealthy relationship. I would not expect any partner to forget a conflict, because each conflict reveals important things about that person. So it's not good to ""forget"" - let's say you lie about someone else in the future. Now, it's a sign to her that you have a pattern of lying. She can't forget past incidents because they will affect how she interprets future incidents. 


The hard thing about trust is that is can only be earned with time. There's nothing immediate you can do, besides apologize and reassure her that it won't happen again. "
768,"Yeah reading through all the replies is helping me at least try to understand. He and I have had totally different memories of what happened in our childhood in some cases, and I think I was too harsh on him the other day considering what's going with his girlfriend and baby right now. I was shocked by his comments at first and didn't really think about the deeper stuff. 

Also, about my dad living 30 minutes away, I recall that we (he and I) spent a lot of weekends together and did tons of stuff together, but my brother and he did not. I remember it was because by then, my brother was a teenager and said he didn't have time or wanted to hang out with friends or something like that so it was just me and my dad, rarely all three of us. I took that memory at face value but I'm starting to realize maybe my brother was already pissed at my dad at that point in his life."
769,"Let it roll off your back. It's Facebook. Who cares? If she says something catty to you at a party, then ask her what gives."
770,"How does blocking you on Facebook make mutual social event gatherings awkward?  My advice is to just ignore social media stuff like blocking and respond to how she acts in person.  If she's rude in person, call her on it.  Facebook? Who gives a toot."
771,"Just tell him! ""Tim, i'm glad I could help you with your cat and whatnot, but I'm really busy with my dissertation. It is annoying and distracting when you interrupt my work. If I'm out in the lounge, it means I want to be social, but if I'm in my room, it means I don't want to be bothered unless it's an emergency."""
772,"Wait, which ethnic group are we talking about? I cannot think of an Eastern Bloc country that's so disliked in the US. 

Are we talking about the Kazakhs? Or Romanians? Quite honestly most Americans don't know that much about Eastern Bloc other than most of the countries are ""Eastern Euro"" and kinda shit as a generalisation, but not much past that. "
773,"Sorry, I've been gritting my teeth all evening, listening to my ill-informed relatives talk politics, and I seem to have lost my sense of humor."
774,"He doesnt deserve your forgiveness. Stop making excuses for him. ""Young and inexperienced"" my ass. He did a horrible thing to you and you shouldnt overlook that just so you can have a perfect life with him in dreamland. "
775,I totally agree. It was very wrong of me to do that.
776,"So....so you're saying it's possible to both raise a child while getting things done around the house during the day even when the child *isn't* napping? You're saying it's possible for a child to entertain themselves with the TV or a game while you type on a laptop 5 feet away and not feel guilty about ""actively"" raising your kid?  Get the hell outta here...."
777,"Or that having sex for him is part of a sane and normal relationship, and being abstinent is not. But you are right, probably it is a phase, so he should at least talk to her."
778,I think this is a pretty good idea
779,"She was able to grab the towel herself though. There was no reason for her to hold the laptop while he went to go get a towel, it wouldnt have saved her laptop if she held it why he wiped it down."
780,"So? At least he knows there are taxes and car payments paid, he just doesn't care to ask about how much. But he can't know to ask how much if he doesn't know about the secret account. It's fine to keep 55% to yourself if he knows about it."
781,He is angry. He wanted to tell her husband.
782,"I'd still sit down and discuss it with them using the terms ""sexual predator"" and ""pedophile"" and explain your suspicion that she was abused.

...and consider suggesting your siblings (and perhaps yourself) get therapy.  Even if you dont think you need it, you have no idea what subconscious issues this woman has given you all.  Ensure you don't repeat the cycle."
783,"First I want to say I think what you did was right, I've been where you have been with my wife were it's been a couple months and every time I try she would reject me.  Unlike you though we work on it and change things to help us get back on track.

I have also been in his shoes, when I was in my early 20's I was on an anti-depressant to help me with my social anxiety disorder.  It worked great in that I stopped feeling like I was always being watched and judged by everyone around me.  On the other hand I didn't have an erection for almost 6 months, in fact I didn't even think about sex the whole time.  It wasn't until I realized that It had been that long without any activity down there that I was able to make things happen.  It took more work than I was used to but I was able to perform if needed.  So I understand him not thinking about it, but If I was in a relationship with someone who was bringing it up more than once I would not blame them for leaving if I didn't even try.

So please stay strong, you'll find someone when you are ready that you'll fall for again and then won't be able to keep their hand off of you."
784,"You don't owe him anything. People like this also very rarely change, so I wouldn't hold my breath in that regard. You need to decide what you want to do for YOU, not your father, not your brother. If you want to see him and give him another chance, do it for yourself. If you feel like nothing positive will be gained in your life, just don't bother."
785,"the problem with this excuse, though, is if he was single or lived alone, he'd still have to cook food for himself. he wouldn't just starve to death, or he'd spring for takeout. he's taking advantage of his partner's domestic labor, and 'i cook all day' is a really flimsy excuse."
786,"Saying ""sorry"" isn't a reset button, especially if he wasn't sorry until he thought there were going to be consequences.

FWIW, I actually think it's kinda thoughtless to have a long telephone conversation in the room with someone who's not included in it, if you have the option of going to another room. It is distracting and it affects what else you can do while it's going on.

BUT, that in no way excuses being rude and arrogant towards someone you're meant to love and respect. I could even understand making a rude comment, but ignoring you afterwards is incredibly disrespectful. Why did he think that was ok? How is he actually going to behave differently next time? And that means what is HE going to do, not telling you you should have switched off his console. I think we all know that wouldn't have gone well.

I mean, that's the approach I'd take if it was a first offence. But you know him and you're at the point of leaving so maybe you should listen to your gut."
787,"It doesn't matter. She doesn't have to like it.  Tolerance and acceptance aren't the same thing. If she didn't want a cross-dressing boyfriend, she doesn't have to date him. "
788,Pulling out is only considered ridiculous because most guys are idiots and don't know their own body. I have used the pull out method almost exclusively for 9 years now. I have had 5 partners during that time and not a single pregnancy scare. I'm not impotent and I doubt all 5 girls had trouble getting pregnant.
789,"TBH, that's kind of overkill unless she's on the progestin-only pill (less common). Most women take combination pills and if she takes those within a few hours of her normal time, you're fine. "
790,"It's not new, it just hasn't surfaced towards you until now. There is nothing supportive or solid or pillar-like about her behavior now. This type of thing is only going to make your disorder worse, depending on your meds and if you're in a manic or depressive state. 

I say, there a billions of people in the world, she is not the only person that can be a pillar to you. "
791,She is going to hate all of you when she finds out you and your family knew and did nothing.
792,"She doesn't really have a choice (nor do you, if you want to stay with this girl).

You can't fix crazy. The best you can do is get away from it, and stop letting it control your lives. You're not children anymore. I know it sucks cutting off family, but there isn't a choice.

As long as you play by their rules, you're not dating Sally, you're dating her, her mom and her sister. If you want that to stop, she needs to learn to be independent.

Living on your own at 23 is hard. It's not impossible"
793,"I mean, you're *right*, but taking that position turns it into a coin toss as to whether the boss fires her on the spot right after that conversation."
794,"What money would you be using for start up? Can you set up dinner with the two of you and your mentor? It sounds like you've done some of the leg work. Have you talked about how long you would work at it without an income before you decide to get another job? Also, what are job prospects like if it doesn't work out?  

Ask her to make a list of things she is concerned about and then try to go through them and see if you can work out a compromise/plan that addresses each of them. "
795,"You should give her this letter so in a few years she can show it to her friends and laugh at the fact that she ever dated you. It is passive aggressive, condescending and shows you in a terrible light. "
796,I don't know why you're being down voted. It's ok to be uncomfortable living with someone who is attracted to your sex. It's also OK to have differing views on what is and isn't appropriate interaction between platonic friends.
