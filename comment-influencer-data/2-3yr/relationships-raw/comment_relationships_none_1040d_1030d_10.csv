1,"In my family, writing specific Christmas lists is the norm. We include pictures, what color and size we want, and prices. It's not a ""demand list,"" it's just something my family does. "
2,"That's lame. You were there for him physically, now he's not there for you. Selfish. He needs to get to the bottom of his sudden libido drop. Unless it's something like *severe* depression, which it doesn't seem like, then his behaviour is inexcusable. Even if it was he has to be willing and open to work with you through issues.

Not caring about your partner's sexual satisfaction is not a good sign"
3,"&gt; The studies have said that of people who have cheated, 45 percent cheat again. That means 55 percent DIDN'T cheat again. While roughly 50/50 odds aren't great it's not nearly ""Once a cheater always a cheater"".


That's good to know but not applicable to OP's situation, because her STBX **is** a known serial cheater. So always a cheater, always a cheater."

5,"Soo...you were dating her for 6 months before she even asked for a divorce?


Also, as for the original post, I'd insist that she call and actually talk to her dad about it first. Tell him that it is her, not you. You don't want his first knowledge to be while you are there."
6,"I think it depends on the type of accounts they're following. It says something different if OP is following hot actors and athletes and her husband is following random ASU students or sexy instagram models. 

If OP's following random hot guys she should hide that out of respect for her husband."
7,Yikes :O that sounds really bad! What happened?
8,"Nope not a deal breaker. What if a friend or relative were telling her something personal? What if she is planning to do something for you? But no, you go straight to cheating. Don't be a douche. "
9,Did you read the post?  I think she'd be happy to cut contact with him.  She said the pretty much the only reason she has anything to do with him now is because they have mutual friends.
10,You have to lose the insane girlfriend.  There is no other solution.
11,"If you've been bleeding for three days and it's not time for your period, then yes, you need to see a doctor. That's not right."
12,IDK what about a 16 year old dating a 19 year old? It sounds creepy as hell
13,"No, but for some fields, the prestige and contacts makes a difference."
14,"If the lying doesn't end it, the fact that you're clearly not even a little bit sorry about what you did likely will."
15,"You are being selfish and unreasonable
You said to him that you were going to study and when YOU ended studying you expected from him to drop whatever he was doing and talk to you. All of this is onesided."
16,"Common denominator: you. When you stop tolerating bad behavior, you will start attracting those who don't display it. Maybe you should try dating some of those people who you say think you're attractive and go after you all the time. Or, maybe you should stop dating altogether until you figure out why you're only attracted to men who will hurt you. "
17,"Exactly. I feel bad for him for being so neglected by OP's husband and his ex-wife. It's disgusting. I hope he grows up into a happy, decent man. And I hope OP's little munchkin does too. I think OP is doing the right thing here for everyone involved. "
18,"And what about the hard work from her? He isn't getting drunk and cuddling/flirting with female friends, that is on her."
19,"That sucks but is really eye opening (and disappointing). 

Well one day there may be worth in recording his outbursts and showing it to him at a later time. He clearly has no idea the impact these outbursts have. "
20,"I'll eat my shoe if one act of unpremeditated violence by a 12 year old child is enough for an order of protection to be issued. OP needs to protect her child, sure, but some of the advice being given here is really over the top. "
21,"hahahahahahahahahaha

You're a moron. Do you really think anyone will believe you blindly downloaded Tinder and then blindly swiped right on women and then blindly messaged them?


Guess what? You're a lowlife for trying to cheat and you're a dumbass for trying this excuse."
22,"My friend has adopted a rule of 3:

* 3 dates to determine if you are really interested
* 3 months to determine if you want this to continue long term
* 3 years to shit or get off the pot

If after 3 years you aren't sure you want to marry her, you need to examine if it's her or if you have commitment issues. If the former, you need to break up so you don't string her along. If the latter, you need to do some soul searching. 24 may seem young to get married and you will both change over the next few years but we all change constantly. At this point it's just an excuse.

I just got married a few months ago. It's pretty awesome. I live with my best friend and we have a pretty good DINK life (double income, no kids)."
23,"So.  Aside from all the other comments, some which did seem helpful, I do this.   What your bf did, I do this to my wife.     She found a loophole that kind of stopped this.   While she's cooking, she'll holler at me and say ""try this "".    Well, once I've tasted it and know if its delicious or meh, then she doesn't get upset as much if I decline eating any.    Involve him as the "" taste tester"".    More often than not he's going to say something like ""add pepper.  Add salt.""  Etc.   But he's gunna look forward to it vs just being like ""oh. Soup.  No thanks."".   Give it a shot. Can't hurt. "
24,"Hey, why are you getting something for her?

The normal not to mention polite thing to do for her would be to thank you for the wishes, say something about her day and assure you that it's no big deal that you forgot the actual day.

Especially since she hadn't mentioned it at all. Don't encourage people who expect you to be a mind reader."
25,"Look, you are young and naiive so you arent aware quite how bad this is.

Your boyfriend is disgusting.  An absolute pig.   The idea that you should feel obliged to let him HURT you because someone else has in the past is fucking horrific.

Please see this for what it is : he is angry because you wont let him sexually gratify himself in a way that hurts you"
26,"Why are  you dismissing the negative aspects of his personality?  You say his good behavior is ""normal"", but he's shown you how awful ""normal"" for him really is so pay attention.  

  **He will not change, this is how your life with him will always look and feel.**"
27,delete/deactivate facebook for 6 mo-year asap. then make it so its unlisted/unsearchable if people aren't already friends w you.
28,"I'm a black-outer too - I discovered this at uni, although I haven't done it in years because it's actually very scary and totally irresponsible. I'm having a great time and then just wake up in bed, with nothing in between. I then have to piece together from speaking to friends what I've done, and it always, always involves apologies, and sometimes chocolate and flowers (I only ever really barf from alcohol when I'm blacked out too, but when I'm blacked out i generally keep drinking so will at some point - I remember puking up maybe like twice and any other time during my terrible alcohol experimenting years at uni).

I agree that people are totally different (I'm an 'I love you' drunk, although not in a horny way in the slightest I just make brand new best friends and love my friends immensely), but that doesn't make it an accident if you have sex when you're like that. It means you didn't have control, yes, but unless someone has spiked your drink or otherwise taken the choice away from you, it's you who drank to that state. Most people are either careful of their limits, or have learned them the hard way, and there are no excuses for drinking so much that you end up blacked out and sleeping with someone else when you're in a relationship. I'd break up with my BF if he did it, and I'd expect him to do the same to me. That's a big part of why I just do not drink to excess like that anymore. Personally, I prefer to be the driver nowadays if I'm going out clubbing or something with me single friends, because it not only means they can all drink but means I'm well out of harms way when I'm not with my boyfriend."
29,Why do you hate PDA so much?
30,"Wow. I'm exhausted just reading this. First of all, you're an amazing daughter and niece! 

Tell your uncle to hire a property management company. If he has 5 rentals, he can afford it. You don't have the time, you don't need the stress, and you shouldn't be doing it for free. 

As far as your mom's SSI being cut off, there could be several reasons (I'm on SSDI, so I've dealt with the SSA- what a nightmare.) Believe it or not, if you accumulate too much money in your bank account, your SSA will be temporarily cut off. They figure you don't need it if you can save that much. Or she might have missed a mailed request for information about her medical condition, or her doctors did not send medical records that were requested. If you have access to her ssa.gov account, you should be able to find out why on there. 

Since your mom is on state Medicaid, she should have an assigned case worker who can look in to getting her a part-time caretaker, or seeing if she qualifies for assisted living. 

As far as buying Depends... get online and Google ""Depends home delivery"" and you'll find a zillion companies who will deliver them straight to her door! You can even check with her doctor and see if he'll give her the necessary diagnosis for Medicaid/Medicare to pay for them. It shouldn't be difficult, since it sounds like she's pretty frail and weak. 

Take care of yourself- and know that there are strangers on the internet thinking of you and wishing you all the best! ❤️"
31,"And she got pierced nipples and tattoos 'cuz the dude was into them? I mean...maybe if she was already thinking about getting those things, but those are permanent/semi-permanent changes to your body, yo. I'm trying to think about the kind of personality that would do that to please someone else, and what that would mean for a relationship with that person..."
32,"I think that if you participate in a shitty thing, then you are also a shitty person. Just because you weren't the one who made the vow doesn't mean that your completely absolved from any sort of responsibility, blame, or stigma. The fact that this is your contention, actually, is utter nonsense. If you knew he was committed, but you engaged in this sort of thing anyway, then you too are at fault, there's no 2 way's around it. That's basic logic. 

btw no amount of down votes changes that^"
33,"&gt; She says she wants to be with me, 

What reasons has she given you for _why_ she wants to be with you and how do those reasons stack up to her having maintained a long-term affair?"
34,"Lots of people are against abortion in theory, so long as it's a hypothetical, but when faced with an unplanned pregnancy of their own find it within them to support an abortion -- even if it's only their own or that of their girlfriend/sister/daughter/wife, etc. Abortion clinic escorts often tell stories of seeing the very women outside picketing against abortion rights later coming into the clinics for medical abortions.

If you and your boyfriend are using birth control and having premarital sex, he can't be that strict a Catholic. I would absolutely suggest you tell him you are pregnant and not ready to be a parent. Inform him of what your decision is. This is not something to be presented to him as a matter in which he has a vote equal to yours. Ask him for his support. If he won't give it to you, why would you want to be with someone who fundamentally disrespects your bodily autonomy, responsibilities, and life priorities that are not, at this time, inclusive of pregnancy and child-rearing, particularly when you're unmarried?

ETA: This is why I only have sex with pro-choice men. This is a topic on which I cannot agree to disagree because it is so fundamental to intimacy and handling difficult situations like the one OP is in."
35,I wouldn't really worry about the daughter in this situation. She's 8 and her dad told her it was okay. It's not like she went over on her own.
36,"You know what made it worse? The fact that another neighbor had to tell them. If you guys went over as soon as they came home, it wouldn't have been as bad. That would have been you guys being upfront instead of waiting to get caught. 

What's wrong with your husband that he thinks it is okay go to into other people's properties and take their things? 

You guys should be lucky they aren't pressing charges. "
37,"Is having them share a room REALLY that big of a deal? Is it wrong because they might have sex? Yeah, they are going to do that anyways. I know it seems a little inappropriate and just like crossing a line in a way, but I think you just need to get over it unfortunately. 

I think you should let her go. If you don't she's really going to resent you, and with her nearing legal adulthood, it's generally unwise to alienate your kid. 

The best thing to do is to just keep the lines of communication open. Tell her that she can go. Tell her that she is also NOT obligated to go. If at any point leading up to the trip she doesn't want to go or is questioning her relationship, that this trip should not play a factor and she should absolutely not feel like she needs to stay with him because this trip is paid for."
38,"If you like you can tell her about your crush and that you need to heal from it so are creating some distance. If you like you can be her friend again after you're healed.

but ultimately your healing comes first. Putting it off, even to spare her feelings, will only make things more difficult for you. "
39,"I have a copper IUD and it's badass. I got it installed in 2008 and barely have to think about it. The first few months were a nightmare, but since then it's been smooth sailing.

And I don't have to get it replaced until 2018!!"
40,You can tell her that you regard making out with anyone else cheating. That is a totally okay boundary to have.
41,"If you question whether to leave your girlfriend because something else may be better/more exciting, you should leave your girlfriend even if you weren't going to pursue the new interest. 

Your relationship sounds like it was dead from the start. The two of you are together for the wrong reasons, so break up for the right reasons: not because there may be somebody else, but because you two I aren't good for each other. "
42,I would be freaked out if I were her too. Imagine if it was her that got a job at this company where affairs are encouraged and lots of attractive people are available? How would you feel? Ultimately it comes down to..are you willing to live with this work environment and how it will effect your relationship? 
43,"Lol what. His siblings don't have the scars, so clearly the parents aren't into marking up their kids. It's extremely possible OP forgot about a traumatic childhood event, maybe a relative cutting in initials or something, but a cult is definitely not the most reasonable guess. "
44,"I'm pretty sure he means:

""My family? Search me--they must have seen it before."""
45,"So selfish! You don't even seem to care or understand how much pain you caused, to an innocent little child. You care about ""getting out of it"" and having your parents not be angry at you. You don't care that you hurt a defenceless and traumatised little boy with no family. Shockingly bad. Be a better person. "

47,"Public humiliation, especially in the digital age, is worth so much more than $400 dollars. "
48,"Well to break it down: most people don't like being betrayed by those close to them. Wacky, isnt it?"
49,Go with your dads school. You will not regret it. 
50,"This isn't about the party though. Not really. This is about his GF going behind his back to do something he expressly asked her not to do. Instead of talking to him about it and trying to persuade him, which is still pretty crappy, she's trying to do a run around to force the issue.

It's easy to miss the fact that this is pretty awful behavior because it's not like she's cheating on him or stealing his money or some other thing everyone knows up front is bad. We as a society are conditioned to think of parties as always good, and people who don't like them or don't want them as the ones with the problem.

This is an issue of disrespect and boundary crossing. 

This is not an issue about a party. "
51,Oh that's really passive aggressive of him. If you don't bring the chairs into your home he will complain about your decorating style even more and if you do bring them in he will regard it as a victory for light stained things. I think it might be best to just tell him you don't have the space and get someone else to take them. 
52,This...so much this. I am by no means the same person I was at 16. Your friend took advantage of her age and yes that is disgusting. 
53,"Well, now you know something about your husband's character as a man."
54,"you're not responsible for teaching him the error of his old-arse ways. that's toxic emotional labour that you don't need to take upon yourself. you know you're awesome; just keep that flame burning in your insides and grey-rock the old bugger if he tries that oppressive shit on you again. you don't have an obligation to expose yourself to his rancidness, 'even' if he is family. "
55,Thank you. :)
56,"&gt; I have a friend who started a relationship with a guy. But at the beginning she was not so sure about if she liked him or not. In the same time, she slept with her ex boyfriend, for I think a couple of months.

&gt;Then, she really got into this guy, her boyfriend, and fell in love for real. She stopped all contacts with her ex boyfriend and started a faithful relationship.

&gt;Obviously her bf does not know.

Assuming your friend started this relationship as monogamous, your friend is a piece of shit and her boyfriend should know.

If you cannot take a relationship seriously at first, then don't get in one...it's that simple! If you are on the fence about someone, then just date them casually instead of closing off their options!"
57,"What does race have to do with this?


Stop talking to blondie. Communicate with your girlfriend, tell her what happened.

Be single for a while, since you're apparently not capable of a monogamous relationship."

59,"I mean, you only really go on that subreddit if you completely disagree with the general consensus/moderation/content on /r/relationships. Of course you're gonna get a different answer.

&gt;guys and gals cant be friends with out sexual tension

I can tell you this is unequivocally stupid. "
60,[deleted]
61,"26 and 27?

Really?

Too old for all this shit. "
62,"You talk a lot about how she loves you. But it sort of reads like you don't love her as much.

That isn't healthy or fair to either of you. Being comfortable with someone is not necessarily a reason to stick around. If you feel stifled now, sticking around for years will lead to more resentment.

Have you tried including her on adventures you want to try? Try to spice things up with her. Tell her explicitly that you are craving more excitement. "
63,"Me too. But let me tell you. I've posted in here looking for advice and the least helpful, most demoralizing comments were the ""grow a spine etc."" people. Here were all these comments berating me for feeling the way I feel when I was really asking for help. People making strident bullying assumptions about me as a person because they saw my actions as weak and my motivations as worthless. You can't bully someone into...not getting bullied? Don't take your anger out on the victim of the system you're angry at. "
64,"Damn, this hadn't even occurred to me. Thank you!"
65,Many people in their early 20's are far from adults.
66,"I really hate myself when I'm insecure and paranoid. But I feel like being insecure makes me needy sometimes and then I'm scared that it will make him not want me and leave. It's like this weird circle of fears. 
Rationally I KNOW that I shouldn't be scared when he's going somewhere with Kate and I shouldn't feel bad or unwanted when he doesn't reply to my text or something small like that because he's amazing in person. But sometimes these feeling come out of nowhere and I just can't help it. "
67,Sounds like you should just break up
68,"I dunno, it's kind of one of those, my husband/fiancé/boyfriend is my soulmate and we're perfect together except for this tiny issue where the partner leaves socks on the floor and then proceeds to go on about the cheating, lying, gas lighting, etc. while still defending how perfect he is for her.

Sometimes people need a slap in the face from perfect strangers to see the bigger picture and realize that while yes, what they originally complained about is an issue, but they should really focus on the other red flags first. "
69,"forget this and move on

We all do regrettable things, to me this is very minor, so no good comes of dwelling on it. This can only make two people's lives WORSE, nobody gains"
70,"He's probably attracted to you know because you're taking care of yourself. Sure looking good is apart of it, but to actually take a step forward and bettering your health is very attractive. "
71,"Let's say you stay and don't take this offer, what will your life be in 5 years? What kind of job will you have? What benefits will you get from that job? Will you even still be dating this girl?

On the other hand being a officer in the Air Force opens a ton of doors for you even after you leave the Air Force. Not only that they give great benefits to you and your potential family. 

If you were single what would you do in the same position you are now?  

I'm going to say you would do what you think would be of greatest benefit and value to you, which I imagine would be joining the Air Force and I doubt you'd even hesitate. 

Now you aren't single but its fairly clear this is what you want to do but your considering staying because of your loving girlfriend who you think could be your potential wife. Which is fine but is that what's best for you or what's best for her.

Also are you certain you won't eventually resent her for this if you do stay with her, like say you never really find a better job for yourself. Are you sure one day in the future you won't wake up and curse yourself for not doing this when you had the opportunity.

My advice is if you would do this when your were single you should do it now, and if your GF doesn't want to move with you or try LDR you'll have to break up because when it comes down to it, you asking her to move is the same as her asking you to stay. It's just that staying is the easier option.

I can't guarantee you'll like joining the Air Force or potentially even hate it but you won't be the stagnancy you are now.

72,"I'm just gleaning from your responses that you may be Christian. I've spent my whole life sinning and any other girlfriends I've had that have cheated on me I had no problem dumping. My faith calls me to have grace, something I am not experienced with, this is my opportunity to work on myself in this manner. How can I ask god to forgive me for the premarital sex I've had for years and years if I can't forgive my wife for the same thing? "
73,It's amazing what can be accomplished when people actually talk to each other.
74,It's there. It's in hiding but once you start down this path you will realize it was there all along.
75,"I got a day and a half of relaxation and 2 days of freaking out and trying to figure how the hell to get home to my family. For the first time in 8+ years.

He's gotten multiple nights away (2-5 nights) on multiple occasions throughout our relationship, over the last 8 years, and I am not referring to anything work related, but go have fun, spend time with his family or friends type vacations (the equivalent of what I got...I went to visit my friend's family), or just go off and spend some time doing whatever (house sitting specifically. Nothing required of him (no pets, not even plants), his brother just didn't want the house to sit empty while he was gone).


And just out of curiosity....why is it that the kids are MY job exclusively? They're OUR kids, as much his as mine."
76,"Start by not calling them ""slutty"" outfits. You perpetuate the myth that women get raped for the clothes they wear, and they don't. "
77,This brand of feminism isn't about spreading a positive message. It is about playing out narcissistic fantasies for those who otherwise don't have a voice and clearly your friend is demonstrating that .
78,"This. I had this raging gut feeling my ex was cheating. He vehemently denied it, even til the end. His friends told me he was cheating. I found shady texts. After that I didn't snoop anymore, because I didn't want the climatic kick in the gut on top of the sinking feeling. The urge to snoop is indicator enough for me. 

"
79,He is too so at least they are on even footing. 
80,"I won't go back. Trust me. Definitely going to tell the manager what's been going on. I'm embarrassed I haven't already done so. I won't be alerting his parents. At first I had considered alerting them because he's so young and I felt bad, but yeah, I definitely don't want to get more involved. I haven't and won't be deleting the emails he has sent me, and I haven't blocked the second email address. 

I hope it doesn't get it to the point where I have to call the police. But I will if the situation escalates.

84,"Cheating is serious business on schools. If your son pulls this shit in college, he could be kicked out. 

If your son steals work and gets caught passing it off as his own as an adult, the best case scenario is that he's fired or reprimanded. Worst case, he gets sued and disgraced in his field. 

High school is much less high stakes, so I would just make sure the teacher knows that your son lied, stole, and cheated, and let him suffer the consequences, whether he's kicked out of the class, has to take an F or gets detention/suspension. "
85,We did - the whole email that this post centers around *is* Mike's side of things.
86,There actually is a band called skillet though.
87,People don't really actively go through just deleting text/fb messages. Especially from someone who they didn't have a horrific relationship with? I'd find it way weirder if she went through and deleted everything....
88,"Maybe he just really knows what he's looking for, and you don't meet that criteria in some way. He's not obligated to stick it out if he no longer wants too.

&gt;I'm feeling kind of weird because I don't know if it's just bullshit. 

OP, whether his reasoning is bullshit or not, the fact of the matter is still that he broke up with you. He is no longer interested in a relationship with you. Look at it this way: at least you know now instead of 2 years from now."

94,"I would RUN to the nearest divorce attorney. Figure out what your options are and how they will affect your life so you can go about it the best way possible.

95,"I think ""nope"" to the idea of sniffing after her continually checking to make sure she's not sleeping around. Why should he have to?

She tricked him into marriage. She led him to believe he was marrying a loyal, trustworthy person. Instead he got... her."
96,"This whole thread hit really close to home; I was this kid, I looked to my aunt for support. 

&gt;There's a big age gap in my family as well and even when I disagree strongly with my mums discipline, I have to support it in front of my sister so that she knows she can't play us against each other or try that whole ""I want to live with you"" thing.

I was your sister, only when I became aware of this it helped me be less impulsive and ""sassy"" with my parents. When my dad yelled too much or my mom was too harsh on me, they did nothing but support each other – and only a few times (most of those by accident) they let me know that one of them actually disagreed with what the other was doing. My aunt explained this to me one day and it was significantly easier to resist the urge to snap at my parents. I realized they were more reasonable and considerate of my feelings than I'd thought.

After a talk with his parents, OP should tell her that they're only harsh on her because they're worried about her, they want to discipline her, they don't want to be too lenient, etc. and the smart thing to do is to not say anything or just react as calmly and maturely as possible.

What she needs to hear imo is that her feelings matter. Her parents shut her down and I'm sure she feels like they don't care enough to listen to her, even though that is most likely not true. When I started seeing a psychologist I felt like my side of the story was finally being heard and my feelings were validated. It helped me realize that my parents weren't as terrible as I thought and they only wanted the best for me. She needs to hear that her parents *are* doing something wrong, but 
• telling her off is right
• she's handling it worse.

(This is based on personal experience so I can't guarantee that it'll work)"
97,"I highly doubt she's pregnant. Based on the information you've shared, she sounds like she has a lot of attention seeking behaviors, and is probably setting herself up to miscarry for even MORE attention. 

If she IS pregnant, it sounds like it's probably not even yours. 

My money's on her miscarrying within 2 months, before she should start showing. If that doesn't happen, and if she is visible pregnant, consult an attorney and demand a paternity test ASAP. 

Update us when she suddenly miscarries and blames it on the emotional distress you've caused her! "

It significantly raises blood pressure, causes damage to the heart muscle, causes havoc all over the cardiovascular system, can lead to blindness, and y'know.. death. 

And here's what I can tell you about sleep apnea and the study: The standard sleep study works like this - they're two parts. The first being the diagnostic (wherein Sleep disturbances are identified and a treatment plan is divised), and a therapy session (wherein the treatment plan is deployed and verified to work (in the case of CPAP deployment, therapeutic pressure is also determined)). It's rare to work differently than this because treatment plans (prescriptions) should be performed by doctors - not technicians that are observing. 

Y'know when this protocol can be overridden? **WHEN THE TECHNICIAN IDENTIFIES THE SEVERITY OF THE CONDITION AND HAS IDENTIFIED THAT THE PATIENT IS IN SERIOUS RISK OF DEATH.** 

I'll put it another way - your husband's condition is serious enough that the legal risk of not treating your husband is greater than having a non-doctor prescribe treatment. This is not something to be taken lightly. 

I'm not gonna lie - the CPAP kinda sucks. But the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, and it's not the end of the world. CPAP therapy is also about finding the right combination of equipment and therapeutic pressure. And when you first start using it, yeah.. it feels difficult to exhale. The body WILL adapt. There's what is called a ramp function that starts the machine at a much lower pressure and ramps up over time as you fall asleep. Additionally, there's a ton of different mask styles and machine types. Finding the right combination takes time and effort. 

If he's having headaches and vomiting.. his brain is likely suffering from lack of oxygen during periods. If he doesn't already, getting him to sleep on his stomach can significantly reduce symptoms. But if he wants to live and see his child grow up, a CPAP will likely be necessary. 

Sure, he could (in theory) lose weight to reduce, or possibly even eliminate the apnea. Great! Do that! But in the meantime, he is ACTIVELY harming his body - potentially irreversibly, potentially **FATALLY**  

Now here's the good news - properly treated sleep apnea is a life changing experience. You have NO idea how badly you're sleeping until you start sleeping well. For the first week or two of properly treated sleep apnea it's FUCKING INSANE how good you feel. It's like being on a damned coke bender. The amount of energy you have is crazy. It settles down after that, and then you know every time you sleep without it because you feel like ASS. "
99,"There ARE health conditions that make this very dangerous, but I imagine OP would've mentioned that. Also, IMHE, people with those sorts of conditions are even more diligent about making sure they have enough food."
100,So why do you say things were better 20 years ago? As a whole they were not. You feel like you're entitled to say it because of one specific situation but even this situation is so fucked up. Just because people didn't say anything about it back then it doesn't make it less wrong or messed up. And now you're saying I'm jealous of her? Why would I be jealous of her? I feel sorry for her.

103,"You messed up. Your ex doesn't want you back, and that's her decision. Respect it, and move on."

When  you agree to a threesome, you agree to share your partner with someone. If you aren't willing to get him off and the other person is why wouldn't you let him? 

You should not have a threesome.

111,"It's normal and okay to be jealous. As someone else trying to break into a different creative industry, shit's hard. And you meet people, and they help you, and sometimes you seem to take a step forward and they're a little jealous, or they do so exactly when you hit a setback. We all want to be in the position of more successful people. 

I would try to see this as an opportunity. Your girlfriend's making connections that you can use and if you're acting as her manager that's building relationships as well. If you really want to commit to music, use this as a sign to maybe form a new band, since it sounds like your current one can't work as much as you'd like. If you love her lyrics, maybe you guys can collaborate on something. Her success may not be forever, and your lack of success could end too. Or maybe you'll discover there's a different aspect of the industry where you'll thrive. You're only 21. You admit yourself you and Phillip mostly practice for fun.

I think it's okay to acknowledge your jealousy, as long as you remain supportive."

Why would you want to be with a guy who actively seeks sexual attention from other women while you're in a relationship that you both deem 'serious' AND THEN TRIES TO LIE AND CONVINCE YOU THAT YOU HEARD WRONG.

Ask yourself this- after this event are you going to feel insecure when he goes out alone that he's being unfaithful or disrespectful to your relationship? Are you going to wonder whether he asked that girl for her number with this exact intent in mind? I know I wouldn't be able to trust a guy's words after lying like this and seeking out attention from other girls. "
116,"OP you are in the privileged position to have experienced how he really is, before you got married. He is telling you who he is and that he won't change himself, because he sees no problem with his behaviour even after you explained to him how that was bothering you.

Believe him when he tells you who he is. You are not about to marry just him, but you are marrying into his family that includes all the distant relatives and his mother."
117,"There's a huge increase in the number of younger women pressured into anal sex they don't enjoy. Blame porn. I mean I think porn should be legal, but it's giving a lot of rude guys in the newer generaitons the idea that they're entitled to anal sex without regard to their partner's comfort or happiness. It really sucks.

OP put your foot down, and if he doesn't stop pestering you about it, find a guy who respects you."

121,"&gt;Has it occurred to you that the reason she didn't tell you is because she knew you'd freak out, exactly as you have now done?!

That makes no sense. Why would I have freaked out? Do you even understand why I'm ""freaking out"" right now? It's not because she had an abortion. It's because she had it without ever bothering to inform me she was pregnant. It's a breach of trust, a lack of respect. It's so much more than me finding out she had an abortion.

You're in to him, and it doesn't really matter if he is or isn't in to *you*. If you value your marriage you'll stay away from this guy. Period. That's all there is to it."
125,"My father is abusive.  My mother stuck it out for more than 25 years, for the sake of us kids (please don't do this, it definitely wasn't a great childhood).  She tried to get him to go to counseling (he refused), she tried to talk to him, she would argue for hours with him, she would do what he asked without question, she kept things private, she involved our families, she tried pretty much EVERYTHING short of leaving, and nothing was ever good enough for him, and nothing ever changed.  So, she gave up, and waited until my youngest sibling left for college.

This past year, she bought a house, and made plans to move out.  Suddenly, NOW my dad wants to change, NOW he wants a chance, NOW she's not giving him a fair try at making things work, etc.  Now it's my mother who isn't respecting their marriage vows.....nevermind that he seems to have forgotten the whole ""honor your partner"" thing himself.

It was only until she made a concrete move towards leaving him that he took her seriously.  I know that sometimes, one partner needs a kick in the pants and a wake up call, but.....I also feel that if someone needs such drastic action to take their partner seriously, then they aren't really deserving of the relationship.

You have to choose what's right for you and your children.  You can certainly talk to him and ask him why your (very real, very justified) complaints and wants and needs weren't important to him before this point.  You can ask him why he respects you so little that he would abuse his own wife.  But don't expect any real change.

Oh, and if you're worried about his involvement with your children?  My dad pulled the whole ""if you divorce me I will never see the kids again"" thing.  You really think that's the kind of influence your kids want around?  You think that kind of father deserves unfettered access to his kids?  In my opinion, any parent who uses their children like that are fucked in the head.  If you leave him, and he doesn't see your kids anymore, that is a choice that HE is making.  He's just using them to try to guilt you into staying.  Your boys shouldn't be taught that manipulation is how they keep a woman or man."
126,"Don't tell her, but do spend every single bloody day with her. Bend over backwards to make her home comfortable for her. You need to make amends, even if she doesn't know what it's for. 

This might be controversial, but I would also ask her not to put you in the will. Or if she does want to leave you something, ask that another family member holds it in trust for you until you're 100% better. The idea of an addict getting a large amount of money probably isn't a good idea."
127,"I get not wanting the threesome thing, that's completely your boundary to set, but if what he wants is casual sex then clubs, bars and Tinder might work out better for him than his current approach. "
128,"Wait, you say that you paid $10 for a bill that was $10.24. Did you think of asking your girlfriend with human words to pay the rest? Were you under the impression that $10 was enough to cover a bill that was over $10? Where are you going that has $6 beers but $4 salads?

In the thread he states that he didn't think she could turn her back on her own child, that she's a deadbeat (she pays 125% of child support), &amp; that he didn't think he'd have to do this alone.

139,"Maybe he was a bit annoyed that you didnt ask? I'd probably be a bit annoyed if my partner and I were hosting guests and he didnt run what he was serving by me. Especially if he spent ages and a significant amount of money on something that I didnt feel like, was kind of unecessary and wasn't necessarily a good fit for the evening. 

As for trying it, fair enough the polite thing would be to try it but I think after a certain amount of time together relationships get past the point of strict social pleasantries. I think it would have been different if you had spent over an hour lovingly making a home made romantic dinner for 2, but in this case he probably thought the effort was directed more towards the other 2 people there anyway, and the boy just didnt want soup."
140,"If you end up breaking up with her or get broken up with, make sure you tell your mutuals asap. They'll believe the first person they hear it from and she and her sister are going to try to paint you as a predator. "
141,"""I'm still making sure she gets off but she's still being angry before bed"" 

I don't have a solution for you, but I know why she is angry EVEN though you're still tending to her sexual needs. I had this problem with my ex, basically a lot of women don't care so much about the actual sex, but more about the fact that you WANT them. 

She probably feels like 'he's just going down on me to make me happy but I want him to WANT me sexually.' She could probably care less if you do anything for her right now, she wants you to be initiating to show her you still find her sexually appealing.

But yeah, I went through this with my ex too, eventually his testosterone just picked back up naturally. Ultimately, the reason you're not up for it is because your health is lacking somehow, not majorly, but just a little bit. Try eating healthier or getting a good night's sleep for a solid week."

Also keep in mind it will be far harder for your ex coworker to find new employment when she stole from her employer than it will be for you who was fired for transgressions 7 years ago (which is also ridiculous IMO regardless of the law).

Is it possible to get a reference from your employer?  I mean - if they had no intention of firing you UNTIL this girl went on a crusade against you then I can assume that you did a good job prior to that...."

Logically I know I need to get rid of the dependence I have on her but at the same time it feels like I'm losing something huge.  How do I sort out that feeling of loss / move past it?  How do I move past that feeling of ""I want to hear from her?"""

156,"This isn't lack of communication, this is lack of respect/care. If he cared, he would tell you where he was and why he wouldn't make it. That would save you hours of suffering and waiting. I experience this on a small scale, my boyfriend ACTUALLY has problems communicating and sometimes loses track of half an hour (NOTE: NOT HOURS OF TIME) and will leave me waiting to go to bed (we are LDR and skype before we sleep, it's a ritual we both respect and love). And when he's busy he usually texts me, but once or twice has forgotten to say it to which I say ""I was worried something bad happened, please text me next time you're going to be busy for a few hours"" and he corrects his actions, taking fault. Note, I worry not because I'm obsessive or anything, but because the few times he's not responded for days or hours he was seriously hurt mentally or physically and we are very regular and open with our contact. So yeah. If your boyfriend cared he would compromise for you. He would think about you more often and appreciate your gestures.

165,"She isn't ready to get married. Immaturity is a huge factor here. When you get married you pretty much are ready to acknowledge the fact that this is the person you will be with and she isn't ready to narrow her choice down yet. I don't think it is really a sex thing as much as "" what if there is something better out there?"" I mean what is she going to do if she is more sexually compatible with him and then marries you ? She will still have regrets the rest of her life. She is not ready for marriage, don't marry her yet, if ever. "

171,"You shouldn't have to be taking care of him but to the extent that you will be anyway, I think that conversation needs to stop being about what you think of him (you already made that clear) and focus on what he thinks of himself (he's obviously in his own crisis about his masculinity).

Perhaps a good way to get him out of his funk and back to the supportive role you need and deserve is to put it all in terms of his ""manly"" role.  He feels like he blew his opportunity to be the hero, whatever, you've made clear how you feel about that.  But right now he's moping about a past event he can't change when you need him to be present with you as your support and protector which is the ""manly"" role he actually could be fulfilling but is currently blowing.  Right now he needs to set his own shit aside and show up for the person he loves.  I see that as a very masculine role.

It's stressful as hell and no way would I tolerate it at home. "
174,"Yes, but OP did say she wants to space. So let's assume a gap of three years between each and no complications with babies made on first attempt - hypothetically, 32, 35, 38, 41 are the ages she'll be having her 4 kids if the stars align and the water temperature is right. (Assuming, of course, she has them with this partner; if she decides to find another partner those ages could blow out a bit.)

That puts OP at around age 59 when her youngest kid turns 18. Now, at this point this starts hitting home for me. My parents had me that late in life, and I am now a 24 year old who makes career and relationship decisions based off of how many years my parents have left. I have given up jobs overseas because I'm concerned that I wouldn't be able to make it back on a flight quick enough if something happened to them (Australian, so that'd be a nice long 24+ journey), and I've broken up with boyfriends I loved whose timelines didn't accord with having kids before 30 because I can't bear the thought of my parents possibly never being able to have an adult conversation with their grandkids. 

There's nothing wrong with having kids later in life, but I have spent my whole life envying my brother who is ten years older than me and who's been able to travel and take his time before settling down and having kids, or the other kids whose parents could go on rides at theme parks with them (something my own parents couldn't do due to health problems that came with age) or play with them or whatever. I wouldn't fault anyone for shying away from having kids in their mid- to late-30s, and that's completely ignoring the additional complications that can come with having kids later in life. "
175,"Well - we rarely post our pictures on facebook. We just don't think it's important. But I posted a picture some time ago, tagged him on it and I made it public. His fb friends even liked it. And it is still on his profile. It is my picture so I see that it is still public. "

***

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; got home. hugged my kids, kissed them...then went to bed and laid down...called her over...i couldn't contain myself guys

u/throwaway_calecia, I thought you were about to say you had done the big shit. Seriously.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; i'll admit i got dramatical and said...""you know, i just realized over the course of the day, that i could very easily let you go, but don't do it cus it wracks my brain to know my kids won't be with me.""

In your head, it probably sounded like you were saying she crossed an unforgivable line, but in reality you sounded like ""I realized that you don't mean that much to me"" to her. In other words, you started the conversation hanging an end to your relationship...

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; ""I had told you from the beginning of how i had done this with previous ex's for shit that was considered a show of how they no longer wanted to be with me and broke up right away.

...and then proceeded to accuse her, puting your baggage on her.
She is not your ex. Exorcize your ex from your mind. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; I saw your whatsapp and saw you've been having conversations with your ex for a long time and welcoming conversation that involves flirting knowing full well he's married.""

So was he single, would the situation be ok for you? Why did you bring his marital status to the table? It doesn't matter, op.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; i have a screenshot of all conversations with him over all these months, let me contact his wife and send her the screenshot...and if SHE SAYS there's nothing wrong i will apologize to YOU. She now says there's no reason to try and wreck a marriage over nothing.

You threaten her and someone else's marriage. Don't do this. Bringing pain to other people isn't going to appease yours or erase anything.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; THEN IF NOTHING FUCKING HAPPENED...LET'S SHOW THAT F'ER'S WIFE THE CONVO AND SEE HOW SHE LIKES IT...ARE YOU F'ING LISTENING TO YOURSELF...DO YOU KNOW HOW DUMB YOU LOOK HAVING TO BE EDUCATED BY YOUR HUSBAND ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE DONE WRONG AND HOW YOU'VE HURT ME...HOW DUMB ARE YOU!!???

Educated by you? You threatened, belittled, cursed and yelled. Right or wrong, it would be the end of us if I were she.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; She then went on the defensive 

I can't imagine why...

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; mentioning old back-pocket shit she's been keeping on reserve that she likes to bring up when she makes a mistake...
""Well, what about the times you've gone to your friend's[39F] house and smoked weed at her house?!""
So i say, ""YEAH, I SMOKE WEED WITH A GIRL...A GIRL THAT IS MARRIED AND HER HUSBAND IS ALWAYS PRESENT AND HAS NEVER EVEN FLIRTED WITH ME OR WANTS TO FUCK ME!""...

Be honest. Not with us, but with yourself. Has she already said she doesn't like you going to your friend's? How did you react when she addressed it? Because it doesn't matter whether there is something happening between you two, your wife doesn't like it, so you must think of a way to deal with the matter, and not just classify it as mindless jealousy and ignore it.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; all this sounds a lot harsher in spanish mind you

Oh, man. Knowing Spanish is more creative than English in the cursing department, you crossed two lines at once.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; talk about it with my best friend[30M]...he convinced me to go home and be patient and explain what she did wrong and have more patient and encouraged me to not be so self absorbed and maybe understand we're all humans and want to be loved...even if that love or admiration sometimes comes from other sources. He didn't say she didn't mess up, just that...it happens...and it shouldn't deter me from becoming stronger once we've overcome it.

Your best friend seems nice. At time like these, playing the devil's advocate doesn't help. Your friend must understand that, once he didn't lose time stoking up your anger. I just disagree with the *even if that love or admiration sometimes comes from other sources*. Of course it's impossible to a single person fulfill all needs of another one, but that doesn't mean the other one should welcome any love/admiration from any person.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; now i gotta GO TO HER...and explain again...like a 5 year old why she's wrong? i shouldn't have to do this guys...this shit should be common sense...YOU DON'T FLIRT OR LET A MARRIED MAN FLIRT WITH YOU!

You don't have to explain anything. You have already told her you are not ok with it and, yes, it should be common sense not to flirt with other people when you are married. But, hey, it should be common sense not to insult, threaten and, very possibly, shrug off your wife's discontent in relation to you smoking weed with your friend, too.

Your wife doesn't think she did anything wrong. Accept that her view won't change any time soon. You only have two options: forgive her, apologize and try to get things right in your marriage from now on or apologize for your behaviour (while leaving clear you don't think that flirting is ok) and move on.

&amp;nbsp;

***

&amp;nbsp;

I can't imagine a healthy future for you two right now, but I still think you should try to work your relationship with your wife out. For your kids. I'm not saying to stay married, but to have a cordial relationship at least. You two need to learn how to have a civilized conversation or your children will grow up in an awful environment. I'm sure you don't want that.

195,"Thanks for the info! I'd still choose autism over complications. But I don't actually think that vaccines cause autism (I'm actually on the spectrum myself, and so is half of my family; I tend to think it's genetic rather than vaccine-caused, since my family is not more nor less vaccinated than others) so my opinion is not really relevant here."
196,"Sadly this is my world with my girlfriend. She's not really affectionate, never initiates, rarely asks me anything about my life. Does not instigate physical contact, affection, hugs or kisses. She does hold my hand occasionally if she is out in public.

We get around to sex when I mention it again and again. I am forward with my sexual attitude but it's just met with indifference or just plain annoyance.

This only got worse once she got pregnant and then after the baby even worse. 

I am not happy about it.  I don't know what to do now.

If I were you go to counseling. Tell him how you feel. I told my girlfriend. It didn't change anything. You might want to move on with your life if this is really not making you happy"
197,"I'm so sorry. 


It sounds like you are starving in this relationship; starving for intimacy, connection, attention, affection, and even basic respect... _(That getting up and silently walking away when you've been trying to talk to him is NOT COOL.)_



I understand that he's being treated for anxiety, but it seems like there's something else going on; depression, aspergers, _something_. If not, then it sounds like he just really isn't interested in having a relationship. At all. With you or anybody.



I think you should ask him if he really wants to be married. 


Not just because it's comfortable and convenient, but because he wants to be an active partner, and participate in the give and take that makes a spousal relationship special, and deeper than any other.



If he's honest with himself and you, and realizes that he doesn't have any desire to connect with you on a deep, loving basis, he needs to let you go.



You have a lot to offer a partner, and not being able to give to someone is almost as damaging as not getting what you need for yourself..."
198,"Even if it's technically not your fault that you were abusive (I lack the knowledge to address this one way or another), from her persoective, you almost killed her. 

Let her go. This is broken beyond repair. Get your mental health together. When you can guarantee with 100% assurance that you are not a danger to anyone under any circumstances, then and only then can you contemplate being in a relationship. "
199,"I see 2 options...

1 - She was faking having you as a boyfriend and had to pretend to dump you for someone. If so, somehow talk to her in private and hopefully she'll apologize and explain.

2 - She's a bit crazy and actually had some kind of delusion you were going out. If so, just avoid her til she comes back to reality."

208,"You haven't caught feelings for this guy, you are infatuated with the idea of him. You don't know the current him at all, you only know he's doing well and seems happy.  Moreover, it's obvious your rejection was very serious for him. He actively avoided you after the rejection for more than a year. Honestly, I think it's pretty selfish to step back in and try to start something with someone who clearly had a hard time moving on, just because you now realized you can't do better.  There's a good chance approaching him will raise strong feelings for him, and a pretty good chance he'll find it insulting. Did he talk to you at the recent party? Did he show any interest in even wanting to be your friend? And I really hope the ""should I forgive him"" is a typo.

If you're going to do this, ask him out for something that could be just friends, like coffee. Don't claim you have feelings, you don't even know him. If he turns you down, leave him alone. I think you're better off looking elsewhere where there's no history."
209,"I'm not sure that's accurate. Lots of Counsellors and therapists specialize -- some deal only with adult trauma, other only have client with dismissive attachment patterns, others work exclusively with self harm. So, maybe OP you can seek out a Counsellor that specializes in complex or complicated grief. As sad as your story is, the general pattern of someone dying with whom you had loving and yet distant relationship with, a relationship that feels fundamentally unfinished and yet death has prematurely ended it -- well, that's certainly happened before. And a good grief therapist can you work out all the tangles of it. "
210,"No offense, but like... She's not a toddler that won't take a nap; she's a grown woman with a high sex drive. I don't think looking at this (or her) as a problem to fix is the right perspective. They just need an adult conversation to find a comfortable middle ground. "

When you find the right person they won't make you feel like you have to snoop."
220,"Ugh, this all sounds so familiar. I was with a loser who didn't treat me well, never did his part around the house, couldn't save, was horrible at sex, and all around entitled. I pretended I was happy for so long. I sacrificed. I put up with cheating and lies because I was afraid to be alone, afraid to leave him, afraid to admit to everyone that the perfect façade I put up was fake. I stayed way longer than I should have and married him when I knew in my heart that I shouldn't. 

Like you, I also convinced him and everyone else that I didn't want kids. That wasn't true, but I knew I couldn't have them with him. He was too immature, too much like a child himself than a partner (despite being significantly older than me). I almost had myself convinced that I didn't want them, although deep down I knew the real reason was him, and despite being married I could never tie myself permanently to him like that. 

I finally got the courage to tell my family what things were really like after I got fed up. I cried with my dad, gathered my strength, and pursued divorce. It was hard and I felt like a failure, but it was so, so necessary. I was in my late 20s and worried that I would never do better, but I knew I couldn't deal with that for the rest of my life. 

I'm now snuggled up in bed next to my wonderful husband with my beautiful 4 month old son asleep on me. I am loved and respected in my marriage. My husband is truly everything I could ever want and more: handsome, loving, responsible, an amazing father, funny as hell, supportive, kind, thoughtful, and the best fuck I've ever had. I'm so grateful for the experience of being a mom. It's more fulfilling and joyful and sweet than I could ever have imagined. And I would have never had this life if I hadn't had the courage to walk away from the person that was dragging me down.

You deserve that happiness, too. You deserve the life you want. You'll never get it if you don't take that scary first step, though. "

228,"If you guys break up now, you will still be in limbo - you can't find a compatible long-term partner until you know what you want long-term. 

Your partner seems happy to wait it out longer, but if it is weighing on you then I think you guys need to nail down some timelines. If he wants to have kids in 10 years, how long does he realistically have before he needs to start looking for a compatible partner, so he can find one, and develop the relationship to the point of having kids?

When you are a year or two before that date (or now, if it is really bothering you) maybe you should try some counselling to see if you can get an answer that's different than 50/50. "

232,Those are my thoughts as well. I think he was just trying to have his cake and eat it too. 
233,"Totally agree. It's not an open relationship. She's basically single except she's got someone she comes home to at night. Your partner is so still supposed to be FIRST even in an open relationship, but it sounds like she's basically pushed him to being an after thought. "

235,"&gt;I'm a friendly and nice person. I hate being rude. 

Telling someone you are not interested in dating them is not rude. Standing up for yourself is not rude. Refusing to accept harassment is not rude.

Consider that you're a friendly and nice person. Ok. *He* is not a friendly or nice person, his continued hitting on you after you've declined his advances proves that. So why does his non-friendliness matter more than your feelings? 

That said, I understand how you feel completely and I would probably avoid this person too in the same situation. I have and will continue to use my husband to block creepers, because in my experience most men will respect you as the 'property' of another man over you being a person in your own right. There is also the physical aspect to consider...in my youth I had several experiences of getting followed and groped and pushed up on and worse by men who refused to take no for an answer, which was enough to thoroughly and forever punk me out. After enough of that my standard response became 'I have a boyfriend/husband' and fleeing the scene post-haste. 

Hard to flee since you're at work, but maybe try giving him the 'stone-face' when he talks to you and short, committal answers. No smile at/to him, ever, some creepers take even a smile as flirting and/or encouragement. "

I started doing it back to him. If I saw him looking at me, I'd start whispering to my sister/friend/whoever was with me who was in on it and we'd both start giggling, I'd flirt heavily in front of him with guys I was friends with who knew what was going on, and I always dressed cute. Eventually he got so flustered with everything that he begged me to go out with him again, did not happen, but he sure as hell stopped acting smug around me. I eventually grew up and stopped going to the bar all the time and haven't seen him in a couple years, but seriously fuck people like that. I'd say give it right back to him, but people on here are probably right. You should probably take the high road and ignore him. "

Advice: You don't have to respond or decide this instant. Think. Maybe put you told us and more  in a letter to him - what you remember, good and bad, what you feel, what you think he feels, what you would and would not want from a relationship with him (if any).

Unless your teacher is completely clueless, they'll notice.  One thing to be aware of:  Mason seems like the sort of kid that thinks that they're in charge when the teacher is gone.  If your band director is the sort to leave movies/study hall plans when he's gone, it's fine.  But if he does sub-led or student-led rehearsals, Mason will probably try to take charge.  If he tries to take charge, LET HIM SUCK!  If the sub has any experience, they'll see through him and try to mitigate the situation.  If they don't, then you'll have the opportunity to quietly point out the disaster that happened to the band director when he returns.

Maybe he thought you were better off thinking he was dead than realizing how he was living. Maybe the call wasn't from him but a friend or relative who heard about you through him. 

The caller is the only person who can tell you. Right now you should call somebody else for emotional support. Preferably someone else who can be with you in person. Lose it if you need to, then start thinking about whether it is worth talking to him to find it what actually happened. You don't need to do anything right now.

She can say, according to your own words here, that you wanted an abortion then you left town. What kind of person does that after a 3 year relationship? Abortions aren't fun and they cost money. Why didn't you help with that? 

You're calling the kid your son already. Stop. You don't know for sure and you didn't want the kid in the first place. 

If you want to walk in to a situation you didn't want in the first place, go through legal issues, and possibly end up with the financial responsibility of a kid as well as the time commitment that goes along with parenting then go ask if the kid is yours. You absolutely have the right to ask but asking that question will probably have consequences beyond satisfying your curiosity."
273,"I am the birth mom in a two mom family. Our donor is known, but not involved at all. You need to tread *very* lightly. Any contact from you that implies you know you are his father will have them scrambling for a lawyer. This is *not* what you want because despite the fact that she technically deceived you, birth fathers are pretty high on the ""most likely to get fucked over"" list. She can make a move to sue for support as a preemptive strike, she can make up bullshit to get an order of protection against you, etc.

That said, if my son's donor told me in a very sensitive way that he would like a ""distant uncle"" relationship with my son *if I'm ok with it* I would probably be fine with it. Having two moms, I put extra effort into facilitating his relationships with the men in our family. It wouldn't be confusing to him to have another uncle. I don't want to tell him who his biological father is until he is an adult but if he already has a cordial relationship with that person I don't see that as a problem. 

In fact, I would prefer if my son had an acquaintanceship with his biodad before he finds out who he is. Kids can react all kinds of ways to learning the truth about their ambiguous parentage. I would prefer if he feels lied to that this ""uncle"" is really his biofather as opposed to finding out his father has been around but just out of reach his whole life and he never met him or got to know him. If tragedy strikes and the biodad dies, at least he will have got to meet him.

If you have any other questions let me know. I can't guarantee these women would feel the same way I do but I can offer some insight into their position."

280,"No one else seems to be properly addressing the fact that she LIED ABOUT HAVING A MEDICAL CONDITION. The non-consensual kink involvement is certainly bad enough, but this woman lied from the start of your relationship about a LITERAL MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH. She pretended to her romantic partner that she was unwell, purely for sexual gratification. I think that's hard proof of her untrustworthiness. She cried wolf about health -- if she WAS sick, could you believe that, now?

But yeah, one of these components alone would have been a deal breaker for me. The both of them.... yikes. "
281,"Yea this whole thing makes my skin crawl. It's like third party sexual assault or something. He's consenting the his gf touching him but totally unaware that it's all directed by some dude behind the curtain. It's so violating. Ops sexual autonomy is being fucking walked all over. 

Op this is so fucked up I wouldn't even hamg around for a why. There is no reason she could give that makes this ok. Ghost her because she honestly doesn't deserve the respect of telling her your breaking up.

286,"Your SIL sounds mentally ill. I think your best bet is to have a talk with your husband, where you can decide what needs to be done. The weak link here is your FIL. You and your husband both need to decide what to say to him that will be the best to get him to realize that this isn't working for any of you.

Present it as that you both feel very pressured. You don't want to cut SIL out totally-we both know this is a lie, but compromise is key-but you need time to have to yourself. Set visiting times, and if she doesn't continue, change the locks.

And you offered to pay for dinner so he wouldn't worry/stress about his already dwindling funds. He sounds horrible."
293,"&gt;I'm scared of the possibility of my parents saying no.

You are scared of the wrong thing.

You are scared that your parents will have a negative reaction to this idea, whereas you should be scared that a guy you've had one date with wants to take you away to Florida with him.

Yours parents' reaction is normal. They guy's idea is not normal.

I have a feeing you want an 'escape route' from the horrible things that have recently been happening to you. Actually, you need a bit of dull normality and safety. Give yourself a little time. If Jack is really so great, he won't pressure you and he will offer e.g. a long distance relationship so you can get to know each other properly.

Technically, your parents don't have a say as you are legally an adult. The guy doesn't need their permission to invite you to go to Florida with him. However, it may be worth listening to them if they are people whose opinions you trust."
294,"That's really wonderful that she's been seeing a therapist. Maybe you could ask if you could go with her sometime? Having a third party help you sort out some of these issues might be beneficial.

"
295,"This sub doesn't allow links, but this is advice from Dan Savage:
&gt;You're having a hard time getting girls. That sucks. I remember what it was like when I was 15 and wanted boys and couldn't get any. It sucked. But the sad fact is that most 15-year-old boys are repulsive--that is, most 15-year-old boys are awkward, half-formed works-in-progress. The fact that girls physically mature more quickly than boys means most girls your age already look like young women and they're attracted to older boys--and there you are, aching for your first girlfriend, but still looking like a short, hairless chimp.

&gt;But don't despair, TGTW. Your awkward/repulsive stage will pass. In the meantime here's what you need to do: Worry less about getting your 15-year-old self laid and start thinking about getting your 18- or 20-year-old self laid. Join a gym and get yourself a body that girls will find irresistible; read so that you'll have something to say to girls (the best way to make girls think you're interesting is to actually be interesting); and get out of the house and do shit--political shit, sporty shit, arty shit--so that you'll meet different kinds of girls in different kinds of settings and become comfortable talking with them.

&gt;Some more orders: Get a decent haircut and use deodorant and floss your teeth and take regular showers and wear clean clothes. Go online and read all about birth control and STDs, and learn enough about female anatomy that you'll be able to find a clitoris in the dark. Masturbate in moderation--no more than 10 times a day--and vary your masturbatory routine. I can't emphasize this last point enough. A vagina does not feel like a clenched fist, TGTW, nor does a mouth, an anus, tit fucking, dry humping, or e-stim. If you don't want to be sending me another pathetic letter in five years complaining about your inability to come unless you're beating your own meat, TGTW, you will vary your routine now so that you'll be able to respond to different kinds of sexual stimulation once you do start getting the girls. Good luck, kiddo."
296,"I totally agree. When I went on college tours, I only went with my dad, and my younger sister and mom stayed behind and had a chill weekend by themselves. No need to force everyone to go to something... merely going on college tours together doesn't make a ""family"". Family is about compromise and understanding, and honestly your fiancé just sounds like a self-centered, self- serving asshole who doesn't give a shit about your kids and your opinions. "
297,"People willing to throw an innocent child to the wolves to save face, and then blame you for not kowtowing to their emotional blackmail, are neither family nor people whose opinions you need to give a shit about."
298,"Your boyfriend is an asshole. He is trying to manipulate you into feeling guilty so he doesn't have to take personal responsibility. 


It doesn't matter if it's accidental. He is responsible for his own body. If his body causes damage to anything else, he is responsible. He should have paid for your bedding. He should be understand of why you wouldn't want him spending the night. He needs to go to a doctor and figure out why his nose is gushing blood at random.

Do not put up with his guilt trips. When he starts, tell him to stop. Tell him he is free to see a doctor, solve his medical issue, and replace any items that he ruins. He has to take responsibility for himself, and asking you to be his mommy instead is frankly pathetic and disrespectful.

Do not let him spend the night if he doesn't seek medical attention and agree to pay for any damages. Anything less than that shows he doesn't actually respect you or your belongings."
299,"One, I don't see anywhere in your post where you ""snapped"" and I don't feel you owed her an apology. Cut yourself way more slack. 

Also, if I were you, she would be stressing me the f out and I would nicely tell her that her questions about irrelevant topics and minutiae are causing me to have test anxiety, so you won't be able to study together anymore. It sounds like you have a good handle on what the tests will cover and she's not bringing you anything positive or helpful."

303,"You sound like you have a personality disorder of some kind. 

I've got one too, it's called Borderline Personality Disorder. I'm seeing both a therapist and a psychiatrist. On meds.

Talk to a therapist. Try to work on some of what's going on internally. If you want to PM someome about it send me a message. "

306,"You do not need your ex's permission to have an abortion. In your place, I would leave the state and get the abortion asap.

The other option, if you live in a safe haven state, and cannot obtain an abortion, is to leave the baby at a safe haven after it's born. If you google safe-haven law you can find websites that break down safe-haven laws by state."
307,"Not sure, you should ask her."
308,Exactly. OP should get out of this situation immediately. 
309,"&gt;They're still very polite, but they're not exactly warm and friendly now, if that makes sense. 

Put yourself in their shoes. They were warm and friendly to their new neighbors and the new neighbors wildly transgressed normal boundaries by letting themselves into their backyard and literally stealing from their garden. And by actually destroying some plants in the process, because the husband didn't pay enough attention to his daughter while they were breaking and entering. Would you be warm towards your crazy, boundary-transgressing neighbors after this? The fact that they're not outrightly hostile to you is pretty impressive, if you ask me. 

&gt;What's more is that the other neighbor who tipped them off about the pumpkin is the neighborhood gossip, and now everyone on our street knows about it too and we're getting the cold shoulder from a lot of other neighbors. 

I mean, again, see above. Maybe the other neighbor is a busybody and a gossip, but wouldn't you want somebody to tell you if your neighbor broke into your backyard while you were out? Wouldn't you want to know if this was another set of neighbors? I know your husband meant well, but what he did was a slight step beyond stupid and into illegal. 

Given that neither of you appear to understand precisely how dumb and wrong this was, let's make an analogy. You're baking a cake and you don't have enough sugar. Your neighbor has sugar but isn't home for you to ask. You know she puts her spare key under the flowerpot by the front door. Do you just go on over and borrow some sugar? No, of course not. And going into her backyard to abscond with a pumpkin is the same thing. 

&gt;What can we do to make things better?

Maybe nothing. You've presumably already apologized profusely to the neighbors. That's about it. You can't control your gossipy neighbors, particularly when all they're doing is telling the truth. Hopefully everything will blow over at some point. Maybe have your kid make an apology card and buy the neighbor some flowers, if you think they'd be receptive to that sort of emotional manipulation. (Although, really, she should do it anyway, because 8 years old is old enough to learn a lesson from this.)"
310,"While I certainly think its worth a lesson, I doubt the daughter had a sense of the gravity of the situation when her father was egging her on and actively **took** her over to the pumpkin patch. "
311,"&gt; this is NOT something to be ashamed of

No indeed. But it was well worth your stating it here.

But of course OP's problem is not society, it's her SO - and if she cant tell HIM, ouch."
312,"My ex worked with the managers of the bar for a good few years before we met, so I do believe him.

313,"This relationship should end now, due to the age difference and you two wanting different things from it, but primarily because she is too old for you.  "

317,"This is the answer. If she can't give you a straight answer to the apparent emotional connection she's having with this other guy that satisfies you, then it is time to say goodbye"
318,"The way you talk about yourself isn't a good sign. It's immediately apparent you have self esteem issues. I don't know if that makes you damaged, but the way you see yourself affects how others see you. Have you ever heard the expression, ""we get the love we think we deserve""? If you hate yourself and talk down to yourself, it's going to attract the wrong kind of people to you. I think therapy is a good idea. In the meantime, try mindfully changing the way you talk to yourself. It starts to make a real difference when that little voice in your head goes from ""I hate you. You are so stupid. "" to ""It's okay, baby. You're strong and you're going to get through this."""
319,"""I came across some messages..."" You were snooping, own it.

As for the content, it's clear that your girlfriend got into the relationship--and stayed in it--because she liked you. I know several great marriages and LTRs where one partner has confessed that their initial ""attraction"" to their partner was lacking and took time to build up. They ""liked"" the person but it wasn't until they got to know them that their sexual attraction ramped up.

I'm not that way and it sounds like you aren't that way either, but I think you should take a step back and consider the relationship you have today. Does it make you happy? Is it full of respect and kindness and love? Is there trust?

If so, evaluate the message on those terms and remember that, early in a relationship, sometimes we have unflattering thoughts about our new partner that might not reflect the totality of our feelings. That's what we have friends for. "

What if he needs to have surgery (or you do)? What then, if cuddling and affectionate behavior is not enough to get you through times, even when you know it's not personal, you need to take a look at yourself. 

Also, have you tried telling him you're feeling insecure lately, or any of the things you've put down here? Sometimes just knowing the other person is aware of these things and wants to try to make you happy (even if it isn't by having sex) may make you feel a little better"

STOP INVOLVING THEM. 

You guys are both basically begging them for a relationship, and the more refusal you receive it's like the more determined you are to refuse to accept reality. 

They do not accept you. They do not want to be involved. You will NEVER have a good relationship with them. Accept this and your life will be so much easier. 

Why is your husband in contact with them at all, really? What do they add to his life? They don't seem to have an actual relationship....so....why are you doing this? If it were me I'd have them at the wedding and not call them anymore. 

You have tried. It's not going anywhere. It's actually fascinating how determined you are to live in denial and force people who don't like you to be enthusiastic about you. They don't like you. Move on."

352,"That's a nice theory, but doesn't hold up to reality. The reality is that the innocent child's money is paid to the despicable mom. The reality is that the despicable mom gets to spend it at her discretion. The reality is that OP has virtually no say in how that money is spent or any recourse for her misspending it on herself. 

Child support is highly abused in the US. If it was for the child, a neutral guardian would hold the funds and reimburse the child's custodian. But that would require effort, so the judicial system instead puts on a big show, pretends it's for the benefit of the kids (even when faced with evidence to the contrary), and everyone pats themselves on the back for protecting the kids.

361,I wonder if their partners are as happy as you are.
362,"It is so a misunderstanding. You're just assuming that because OP told us that she was trying to get away and not cheating, he should have immediately realized it as well, and that's not fair or realistic. 

I don't know what the scene he saw looked like in the moment and from his perspective and neither do you. If it had been like you describe and it was obvious that she was pushing him and struggling to get away, then why would he have taken it as them making out? Also, thinking someone is lying when they're telling you that something you strongly believe you just witnessed with your own eyes didn't happen makes a lot of sense to me. 

I think it's a complicated situation and just saying, ""yeah, fuck no"" is irresponsible.  "
363,"&gt; He assumed that my bf and I were going through a rough patch and/or about to break up.

About to break up and/or going through a rough patch is still in a relationship, that makes your friend culpable. He should deal with the consequences and apologize like a man.

&gt; ...but I'm not sure how I can convince one man to apologize to another based on my own misdeeds.

Not just your misdeeds. See above.

If your boyfriend was smart he'd dump you right on your ass. This is a bunch of teenage drama getting dragged out by you. If you &amp; your boyfriend want to stay together and work things out, cut the friend out of your life 100%. Immediately."

367,"I think it's more about being a best friend and a sibling. My first long term girlfriend and girl I lost my virginity to was one of my sisters' best friends. She was pissed when she found out too. And for pretty good reason. If her friend came over, she now wanted to spend time with me instead if my sister. When my sister raised an issue with that, we just started not hanging out at the house. And when we inevitably broke up, their friendship was never the same. Even though I was okay with them being friends. "
368,"Could you try one more time to lay down the law and say ""Listen, I really need to concentrate on the slides, I'd appreciate it if you only asked me about those""? Not to make an excuse, but it sounds like she gets really crazy around tests and there's maybe a tough of anxiety there. Do you have it in writing that it's only the slides that matter? That might help."

370,I want to hear more of this story if you care to elaborate. 
371,"Dude, what the hell? She's emotional because she broke up with you she's emotional because her mom has cancer and you're letting her justify ass backwards logic keeping you in this limbo. What about you? What do you want? She broke up with you because you don't want children and now she's making you carry her baggage and yours. That's selfish. Do yourself a favor after your 11 hour day have a friend meet you with a pizza and a 12 pack at your place and pack her shit up and drop it off. It's going to suck but why put yourself through something for someone who *ucking left you?! This is beyond me."
372,"Be careful with job corps. Some very troubled kids get sent there and it's pretty similar to residential treatment centers. It's a step up, but not too high up. You're honestly much better off having your sister stay with you. They make it sound great in brochures but I know many people who went and are a mess because of situations they were put in while there."
373,"Hey there,
4 years back the same thing happened to me, except it was my dad and my mom (like you) was in the same bind. We ended up selling it and have never looked back. My mom made it clear that the stress and everything that went with it. They're going to be mad because they see it as his place, but at the same time they still don't own it. You know the stress and what you can take on. You could've told them you were going to sell and if they wanted the first pick, you'd let them. But either way, you know your limits. Trust your gut. "
374,"They shouldn't even be allowing the grandparents to give him anything at this point. It sounds like they would immediately bail him out and coddle him some more while trying to pit the parents against them, which is probably why Damian grew up to be such an entitled shit who stole his 8 year old brother's money in the first place."
375,This! Especially since she's been saying for years that she's thinks you two would work well. So I'm sure prior to your date wasn't the first time she's brought you up to him.
376,Phobias aren't rational. Please be supportive rather than dismissive.
377,"My opinion of this situation hasn't wavered since yesterday; I don't trust this scenario. And there's no logical or just reason I'm seeing for why he's seemingly so shady.
If it's a small thing, he should be able to say it right then and there to calm you. I wouldn't delete any comments from my partner unless there was reason for me to actively hide something- which I wouldn't do because we're on open-book terms with eachother."
378,"I'm pretty sure I've expressed all those same opinions/sentiments in my post and in the replies. But yes, thank you.

(Edit: Is it such a crime to reply in a salty manner when someone tells you everything you already know as if you don't already tell yourself those things on a daily basis? If it is, my bad.) "
379,"I had a boyfriend like this in high school. Eventually it escalated to verbal and emotional abuse. 

Your boyfriend violated your privacy and disrespected you. It's also very concerning that in your post you mention almost nothing about how you feel about the situation.

If you're constantly working to make sure your boyfriend isn't going to be angry with you then **you are not in a healthy relationship**."
380,I think the point is that OP IS feeling used.
381,Buck pisses on your floors because your boyfriend refuses to even let him outside. That's neglect. 
382,"Even if her relationship were appropriate, her reaction was not. The way you brought it up was calm and mature, and she acted like a child. She has shut down any conversation, and has made it clear to you that you should not communicate your concerns. That's one way to start building towards a divorce. 

It is not about being ""that"" couple, it's about letting her know what you consider to be appropriate boundaries. There isn't just one level (cheating), there are many different behaviours that we are comfortable/uncomfortable with. Nobody is right in these situations, which is why we have these conversations and try to reach the middle ground. Her defensive reaction is a red flag in itself. "
383,It's not about seeing the morning after pill differently. It's about the actual way the morning after pill works in the human body when you take it. It is not an abortion pill; if she is pregnant at the time she ingests it she will not abort due to that action. 
384,"He needs to know that you can't 'fight' to 'make' an open relationship happen. If one partner doesn't want the relationship to be open, that is a fucking deadbolt lock. "
385,"But you don't hang out with him one-on-one now, do you?

Did you break up with him? Because it feels like one of those weird moves some people do rub how well the dumpee is doing in the dumper's face."
386,"&gt; This is all happening coz he approached you at ur workplace and yet he's happy for you to be the social pariah. That is shit and says a lot about him as a person. If I knew me visiting someone at work was causing them issues, I wouldn't just keep going and pretend not to know.

This is very clearly blaming the kid for these issues that his mom is causing, unless today is opposite day. 

"
387,"&gt; He gets free rent and he also wants a free maid

And cook. And sex partner.


What an ass."
388,"You're gonna get downvoted, but, i see your point. You don't get into a guys bed and talk about condoms if sex is not on the table. She changed her mind, which is 100% allowed, he didn't respect that, however. "
389,"OK is no one going to point out that your father threatened to KILL you? No parent should ever under ANY circumstances say shut like that to their child. It doesn't matter how upset/angry they are, those aren't words that come from the mouth of someone who loves and cares about you. That's abuse, and a crime. Uttering threats is a serious offense. 

It sounds like you're just used to this kind of treatment, like you don't even notice it for what it is. It makes sense that his girlfriend is like this as well, like attracts like. OP, do you have anywhere else you can go? You should not be around these people, you should not have this kind of behaviour modeled to you as how adults speak, to each other, their kids or anyone. "
390,"Advice on this sub is mostly opinion, it's not right or wrong. You can disagree, but calling people idiots and whining about safe spaces just makes you look bad and will of course invite criticism, so don't act so surprised."
391,"We did not have a traditional wedding.  My mother really wanted to throw the bridal shower, and we didn't stick to stereotypical ""roles"" throughout.  We delegated tasks based on people's interests and abilities.  

I gave lodging info to my mom because she requested it and offered to pass it out.

As I explained elsewhere I felt like I could trust my mother with the dress because we had gone over in intricate detail the plan and schedule, and because my aunt (who was acting as a buffer between me and my mother) was with her the whole time.  Based on our morning schedule, having my mother bring the dress was the most logical plan.  Also, as my parents contributed a significant amount to the wedding, I wanted them to feel included.  I did not want to accept their money and turn around and tell them they could not be trusted with the details.

Please understand that I don't feel it is appropriate to write out every single detail of my wedding planning, nor do I think it is relevant to the issue at hand.  The issue at hand is how I should approach her request for my photos.  "
392,"Buying him a new one is way more then a nod, its accepting responsibility, and replacing the object. "
393," She's having a HUGE overreaction to this. It's his life, and as long as he isn't hurting people, he can do as he pleases. She may not agree with his actions, but they are his choice, and she was infringing on his privacy by walking in there. (you were too, but you aren't overreacting to this).

I don't feel there's any way to talk to him about this without him being angry.

His apartment, his personal space. Whether or not you agree with what he did has gone out the window when you breached his privacy like that. It's not a drug problem where he needs support, it's just him being a young man.

If he does tell you about his sexual behavior then do feel free to do this
&gt;  impress on him that if he is going to identify himself spiritually and religiously as he does, he needs to make a decision on where he stands and what type of behavior is appropriate for someone who professes faith as he does. 

But he hasn't invited you into that part of his life, and it wouldn't be okay to impose.

However since you brought up religious background, I understand and suggest you  perhaps confide in a priest/pastor and ask them for guidance, I feel they'd be better qualified to direct you than random internet people.

I feel like it's tricky because you don't want to go behind your wife's back, but she's being incredibly immature about this, and if anything, her behavior to me is more concerning. There's no thought about your son in this, she's making it about her."
394,I'm sorry you went though that.
395,"&gt; How do I get over having to man handle and restrain, my drugged up zombie girlfriend who at the time wanted to kill me.

So to summarize - she takes drugs, and goes on dates with other guys, and she basically went crazy after consuming something. This after you repeatedly expressing your perfectly reasonable boundary against it. Honestly, I'm not really sure what you're expecting here. You've shown and proven that you'll stay no matter what she does. You've forgiven her countless times, and she realizes this. Why is it a surprise for you that she keeps pushing it? You need to understand something here - without consequence, there's no lesson to be learnt. So expect her to keep consuming drugs. And although you've forgiven her for dating guys, you can also expect her to push that boundary as well. Expect her to keep doing all that, because she understands perfectly clearly that you'll always be there to take care of her.

.

You want things to improve? Do you love her so much that you want her to stop taking drugs, and start taking care of herself more? The solution is easy - you talk with her one last time, then you end the relationship. That's the only way she'll stop self-destructing. If no one's there to take care of her, she'll learn pretty quickly how not to put herself in such situations."
396,"&gt; Something about the positioning makes it easier to remember that the argument isn't me vs. them, but rather us vs. the problem.

I like that."
397,"He's the one that's saying he wished a three year old was dead, because let's be honest. "
398,"I don't snoop through personal computers or phones etc. It's a shared laptop, and since mine is currently broken, I use this for going online, and he knows this. "
399,"Yeah, my first thought reading this was that it sounded like a last straw scenario. "
400,"Do you guys ever have a date night or just time away as a couple? This needs to be discussed, but issues around communication can be hard to tackle alone. It might be best to see a couple's therapist who can unpack how your dynamic devolved to this point and how to get back on track."
401,[deleted]
402,"You're confused and selfish. So it has to end when you ""get your fill"" regardless of the other two people involved? Uhuh, ok lady."
403,I imagine she at least has to know a liiiiitle bit that she's a terrible worker just because she asked me. We only worked together for a short while and she's had other jobs since then. It's almost like she's recycled through everyone else.
404,"Yeah, I guess it's just like ...porn, ok fine, random girl you'll never meet. All the people you listed...you know in real life. I don't know, I don't have a real issue with it, it's just an uncomfortable thought, I don't think as many women can relate to that at all."
405,What part of the post suggested that the son's situation wasn't physically or emotionally healthy? Or that he doesn't respect himself or others? 
406,"You can't even navigate the most basic interactions with your *wife,* the person who has pledged her life to you, destroyed her body to give life to your child, the woman who is literally risking death to bring your child into the world.

She is an adult human being, who has some ability (I hope) to contextualize the terrible thing you've done to her.

Children have no such ability. They are totally defenseless. They are emotional vampires. They need to be treated with the utmost care, emotionally, or they can grow into terribly damaged adults.

You need to *learn* how to get a handle on your emotions, for your child's sake. A few months of therapy for you could mean a *better life* for your child. And it sure won't hurt your chances with your wife, who is certainly at least mulling over the idea of divorce right now."
407,"There are different tools for different purposes. We don't normally use a hacksaw to cut bread because it would destroy the bread. Relying on his peers to solve this problem gambles on two situations not happening: his classmates being okay with it or they bully him, in those cases the result would be detrimental not constructive. I wouldn't trust a group to be smart enough to give the correct level of feedback or even the right kind in these scenarios."
408,"Frankly, he sounds kind of sexist.  Even if you like someone better than your kids you don't show blatant favoritism because you still love your kids the most.  Or you should.  It sounds like this parent might love his kids less because they're female or disabled.
"
409,"Then you answer, YES it's so bad!

You have no excuse, OP. My own mother started out racist and homophobic, and it took me less than 3 years after moving out at 18 to get it firmly established that her behavior is out of bounds. You bet she now knows better than to say any of that stuff around me or anyone I know. 

You're a grown 42 year old man, you have no excuse to have let this drag on for so long.

And this reaction right here?

""When my wife complains, I say, ""I know right? That's my mother for ya! ¯_(ツ)_/¯""

Sad. Your wife deserves better."
410,"Yeah, that's a good idea!

My Step Dad and I aren't religious at all, so we both call Christmas 'Giftmas' (so clever I know... but we both made it up together)..."

412,"If you weren't addicted to drugs you wouldn't be doing them. End of story.

You're sooo in love but you're choosing drugs over your loving partner. Rightio."
413,Why isn't your fiancé putting his foot down? Are his parents paying for the wedding or are you footing the bill on your own? This is your wedding and you should be able to decide whom to invite and whom not. Time for your fiancé to confront his mum.
414,???? why is she so passionately mad about a waitress being overtipped $2 tho? wtf? am I taking crazy pills? why is everyone justifying her? 
415,"Finally someone I can agree with. This is worth a discussion of future expectations and some disappointment, but not blowing up bf's plans or family. Being absent for a holiday isn't the end of the world, even if OP had attached special importance to this particular one without informing anyone else. OP is only going to look crazy and demanding to the family that went out of their way to adjust their own holiday plans - a family she plans on being part of. It sucks but she should just do this year whatever she's done most years for her birthday and christmas. She and bf can have a special celebration for new years when he returns. "

417,"Haha well as with most things, what made me happy wasn't necessarily the bath bombs. It was that, in a somewhat tense time in our relationship, my boyfriend was listening to what I was saying and made a gesture as a result of what I was saying to him. It was very sweet, and I'd personally take something like that over some grand gesture any day. It doesn't take a lot to show your appreciation for someone."
418,"You say you don't have your own computer. Does anyone else in the house have a computer? If yes, you could borrow it while the girls are watching TV and stream shows online."

I would tell your parents, and very much limit contact with your uncle."
420,"Yeah. She had to lie the entire time and actively chose her affair over her family. She didn't even confess, she had to get caught! And the whole time she's telling your dad she loves him and playing happy families at Thanksgiving and the whole nine yards...

How do you trust a person after that? "

422,"It is incredibly difficult to have a successful marriage if you actively dislike and don't respect your inlaws.  It usually only works if your spouse is willing to completely cut them off.

&gt;I worry about our wedding. I don't want my family exposed to them, because I don't want them to find their identity stolen by one of them or maybe their purse goes missing. I worry about raising our kids and our kids being around these people. My fiancee agreed that we should never leave our kids alone with her mom and dad, but even still I don't want them to know their grandparents or uncles or aunts at all. I don't want to spend the rest of my life related to these garbage people, having to deal with them for the next decades. I always wanted a marriage where I didn't feel unsafe around my in-laws.

You need to express the above feelings to her in a non confrontational way.  Ask her if she is willing to completely cut them out of your lives.  If not, then it sounds like a deal breaker.

We like to believe that love conquers all, but it really doesn't.  Read about some of the marriages at /r/justnomil if you want some examples."
423,This is insane. My girlfriend is Hispanic and I've already planned my days off with work so that I can guarantee I will be free for her sister's quinceanera in December of 2017. This event would be pretty damn close to if OP's girlfriend wanted him to skip his sister's wedding. And that is no exaggeration. 
424,Can confirm that your boyfriend sounds really great!
425,Might also train the dog not to accept treats from them because Mom will get mad at him
426,This is the right way to go but I really don't think its emasculating to tell a man that what he said is not appropriate!

428,"Thank you very much for your response, I'll post an update when everything is sorted out."
429,"The husbands sense of entitlement is appalling. I just can't imagine why when faced with a disappointed 8 year old the response is lets rush out and steal pumpkins from the neighbors instead of ""I know honey, I'm sad too that it didn't work out this year. How about we get a pumpkin from the store and then go do X this weekend?"""
430,"If you're still in love with her, and she knows it, and she's not in love with you... Then, yeah, she's trying to distance herself because that probably makes her uncomfortable. And she definitely doesn't want to spend one-on-one time with you because of that.

I'm sorry. I realize it hurts. But you have to accept that she's backing out of this friendship. If you had gotten over your feelings for her, and just wanted to be casual friends, I think it might be salvageable, but since you haven't, it's probably best for both of you to let contact quietly fade."
431,"While the sub has general trends it's still just a collection of random people from random places. What can be upvoted one hours will get downvoted to hell another.

437,Somehow the nuance of this situation escapes me. 
438,"I'm definitely done giving him money. A job that forces you to be in red by missing ONE day is not a job, it's a joke. I am just not looking forward to him guilt-tripping me because he can't afford to get to work. "
439,"Gawd! makes me appreciate France a little more. But consider at least some sort of job, then continue to apply for jobs you *do* want, I think it looks better on your CV, rather than not having a job for 2 years. 

And still continue with your business on the side, one day you might get the breakthrough you need.

How far away from the border to France do you live? Maybe it's worth applying for jobs in France. Or try applying for seasonal work. Winter's just around the corner!"
440,"I don't know why you are allowing someone you've only been seeing for less than a year to make decisions for you based on your appearance, but from the way you make her sound, it doesn't appear see remotely cares about your opinion.

It's likely she isn't used to having the freedom to do what she wants, when she wants and may be over doing it a bit and frankly, I don't blame her.

But when you start walking on people who are supposed to be important, that isn't cool. And it's something that absolutely needs to be addressed.

As for the birthday thing, much like you I don't really celebrate it. And I don't care if anyone gets  me a gift. But what isn't okay is hyping it up, promising to ""spoil"" someone and then taking it all back because you blew your whole wad on expensive clothes. That isn't cool and frankly unfair to the person you are hyping up."
441,"A friend of mine moved into our a house a few years ago and unbeknownst to my husband and I, she brought bed bugs.  We had just bought new mattresses a couple mins than before she moved in too.  It took us about 6 months to get rid of them.  We we moving during the end, so we tossed out the furniture and anything extra.  We exposed our belongings to heat (summer in Southern AZ) so we were able to create the heat needed.  We eventually killed them all and got rid of them.  I learned I'm allergic to their bites and would have terrible welts.  She didn't offer to help in any way.  We treated mattresses, we sprinkled diamateous earth all over the place and finally.

I get that they aren't a symbol of being a dirty person, but damn...it's horrifying."
442,You should definitely tell Lily. Either directly or with your husband. It could be nothing or yes it could be a red flag. That's for Lilly to figure out all you're doing is providing the info you have available. You're not overreacting imo. She's your friend so deserves to know. 
443,"Trish really shouldn't be taking Plan B more than 3 times a year, it isn't very good for you! 

Also with a condom and BC, you don't need Plan B or to pull out. I'm sure she's very nervous about being pregnant but the stress is probably hurting her more than necessary. 

I used to use only condoms with my boyfriend for a bit and I was a little uncomfortable with that so I started taking the pill and now we use only that. It's been totally fine and I'm in I guess the peak of my fertility (yuck). "

452,"If I recall the poll that poster is referring to correctly, I think it was less like ""what age group do you find most sexually attractive"" and more ""what age group would you realistically seek a relationship with."" Older dudes still picked 25 year old women, while older women were more likely to want to date men their age. (Not sure if LGBT were included.) I think it was orchestrated by the OkCupid guy, who was just looking at his websites statistics. "
453,"This is absolutely great advice.  Regardless of whether Mike (or Lily) are crazy, OP needs to be completely honest with her own husband.

Husband may have some interesting views (about whack job boyfriend).  If Mike is truly a whackjob and Lily is sort of calling out for help by constantly referencing that Dave exists, OP and Dave both need to know.

There's something really fishy here, and while most of it could be Mike - let's face it, Lily chose Mike."

Any answer you give will never be satisfactory. If you say this one was more attractive, he'll obsess over it. If you say he's more attractive, he'll think you're lying and obsess over it. 

No matter what you say or do, nor how many times  you try to reassure him, it will never be enough to rid him of the jealousy and fear that he doesn't measure up.   He has such low self esteem, he's tied everything into his body image.  

I doubt he'll ever change without counseling in order to ever have a successful relationship with any one. "

463,"Your GF, who is not a resident in the house, used house property without permission and damaged it. By her own irresponsible use of alcohol and/or drugs, may I add. In what universe would she NOT be responsible? "
464,"i am going to assume he was raised in a family where a man is a failure if he doesn't have a job and quitting means he failed or wasn't good enough. this however we know isn't the case. I've worked production warehouse jobs and know the management doesn't treat the workers with any amount of respect because they can just be easily replaced by someone else in their minds. 
Have you tried to have a discussion about how his anger at his job is affecting your relationship? I know coming home every night from a job i hated and was being treated horrid at took a toll on a few of my relationships and it made me learn that killing myself at a job wasn't worth my mental of physical health. I would point this out to him and if he is still stubborn about it put in a ""you are no longer allowed to complain about work when you are home"" rule due to the fact he refuses to do anything about it such as quit and find a new line of employment or even as you noted go back to school. Overall you cannot get him to quit he has to be the one to make that call. putting in the no complaining rule and stressing the impact it is having on your relationship can help sway him to realize he should quit. best of luck."
465,"They are capable of taking care of themselves to an extent, but they obviously need guidance. Yes, they can take a shower and get up for the bus and do their homework and their own laundry, but they are also in special education classes because they both have learning disabilities. One is on the autism spectrum and the other has ADHD, and my mother is in frequent contact with the schools. If she left, I don't know how she would take care of that aspect. Most likely that would also fall to me, also. "
466,"1) Yes, ask her on a real date. Rejection is always a possibility, but you're never going to move to the next step until you ask. It sounds like things are going very well, so say that you're interested in being more than friends and ask her if she would like to go on a date to explore that potential.

2) A nice bottle of white wine would definitely be a good gift, either way. It shows you pay attention to what she likes, but its certainly not too relationshipy. Whatever you were planning on spending on a ring, I recommend spending that much on a bottle of wine and gifting that."
467,"&gt;I could really, really do with some advice on how to deal with her

Go low contact, only see her in public or at a place you can easily leave.  Get a life separate from hers.  Forge relationships with other people.  Most importantly

&gt;I know whoever I date now will be second to A in her eyes

Keep this in mind with any romance in your life.  Don't introduce her to any romantic interests until it is serious and warn your partner before hand.

Your mom's obsession is crazy, literally crazy.  Like, a movie could be made about this.  If she ever hints at seeing a therapist/psychologist herself then encourage her."

You need to control your own mother. Also, it sounds like you let your wife take the fall for your household decision that she shouldn't visit anymore, which is BS. "

473,"OP, this is the sort of thing which builds resentment and can lead to some serious problems.

You and your SO need to start making some proper time for eachother.

2 months is way, way too long for the majority of people."
474,Precisely what I was thinking. He'd be golden. He'd have his pick. OP really would not have fucked him over in the least.
475,"Don't think it might just be the in laws who meltdown on her. If I told my SO a secret and she went and told the person I specifically said you cant tell, the trust in our relationship would be damaged. She isn't just risking her relationship with BIL and other in-laws, but with her husband as well. 

You can say she should still tell, but it's much easier to tell people to risk their relationships and family when it doesn't cost you anything. "
476,"I mean...  It's super nice, but it doesn't seem she knows them at all. Bringing over some (kosher) food and giving your respects for 10 minutes is more than enough. I don't see a reason to spend actual money on this. "
477,"reading to communicate information (like we are doing on reddit) and reading for entertainment (like OP's partner is doing) aren't the same thing at all- the latter is absolutely a hobby. also plenty of people don't enjoy staring at paintings or sculptures because they prefer something else with more/less/different stimulation (eg if someone prefers something with sound), it doesn't mean they don't recognize that art is a form of communication. "
478,"Your sister needs to mind her own business, and you need to tell her that."
479,"Maybe he's shady or maybe he's wrong, but you sound insecure. You sound anxious. You sound overbearing. I think your feelings are completely valid but it sounds like you create drama over text and that sounds exhausting. That type of behavior is going to push him away and perhaps it already has. 

I looked through some of your post history. When your boyfriend was stressed, it seems like you literally couldn't understand why he would want alone time or why he wouldn't accept your help. 

This post sounds exhausting and nothing really substantial has happened yet. Have you considered therapy? Your anxiety sounds pretty bad. I understand you want answers now, but he said you're going to talk tonight (in person, which is better) and your reaction is to come here to make a reddit post. I think that only further exacerbates your anxiety. I think therapy would help you get a better control over your feelings and give you strategies on how to react to things. You can't control what other people do, but you can try and change your reactions. 

"
480,"She is absolutely emotional abusive. This relationship toxic and the sooner you get out the better off you will be. 

Do you really want to be with someone who thinks your inadequate? Someone who tears you apart bit by bit by constantly telling you you aren't good enough?"

483,"&gt;I would beep and beep my horn, working myself into a furious rage until he would come outside and move his car. 

Ringing the bell and asking to speak with him seems like a better approach. You don't say whether you have already spoken to the guy or your neighbours already, which would be a good place to start. "
484,"Be upfront with him about it and tell him support would be appreciated. This sounds like a temporary thing (or at least something that can be somewhat controlled once they find out what it is). Everyone experiences medical problems that make them unattractive...this is why wedding vows say in sickness and in health. Even disregarding that, everyone gets old and wrinkly and saggy some day. Looks fade and aren't everything. If he can't even support and accept you through what sounds like a temporary thing in the long-run, he simply wasn't long term relationship material in the first place. And this is coming from the person who was on the other end of this just a couple weeks ago. My boyfriend got a nasty cyst on his ass that ended in a very graphic lancing at the er that I witnessed, blood and pus and all. They had to pack it after and he had a horrible bloody pus tail for 3 days. It was *disgusting* - but here's the thing, we still had sex and it didn't change how attracted I was to him. At all. Because the ailment itself is gross, not the person who's experiencing it. If you love that person the only thing you want to do is to help them."
485,"Telling her now is the least you could do.

I think you do need proof. He's likely primed her for this, and she won't want to believe you. 

Maybe he's told her about some girl at work that's obsessed with him, that's upset since finding out he's getting married, so without some irrefutable proof, you'll just look like the psycho girl trying to destroy their relationship with lies. 

That will be the story that means her relationship and recent engagement aren't over, so she will really, really want to believe you're lying. I hope you have some very explicit photos to go with the texts, dates and times, and everything else you should provide her. 

Don't kid yourself about your motives. You didn't just now grow a moral spine. This is a combination of spite, and the need to relieve yourself of the guilt you're struggling so hard with. Yeah, maybe 5% is a desire to do the right thing, but that never mattered before the engagement so I doubt it's a significant part of your motivation now. Doesn't mean you shouldn't do it, though.

Also, have fun with the mountains of shitty karma you've accrued. Stay in therapy. You're going to have a reaaally hard time ever trusting anyone you're in a real relationship with ever again. "

487,"You've said ""I don't have anyone else"" like you think your only option is to stay with someone who routinely abuses you for his own monetary and personal gain, and who has manipulated you so badly you think he's doing you a favor.

I can't stress enough how many MILLIONS of men there are out there who would be happy to provide for you, love you, embrace you and your kid, and support you emotionally, who would also *not* involve you in sociopathic nightmare hellish reality-distortion while gaslighting you, pretending to cheat on you (if you can even know he's pretending at this point, which I doubt), and making you think it's your problem. Staying with this douchebag is *not* your only option. It is NEVER your only option. 

At the very, very least, if he has as many fans as you say he does, then thousands of them will be absolutely horrified if you just simply tell the truth about your experiences. Witness how many of us are horrified on this one subreddit. You will have support and friendship when you need it. You are not alone.

I feel like you haven't thought ahead. What happens when he decides cheating on you, abusing you, giving you extra fictional kids (WTF), bad-mouthing you, and making you look like a shitty nagging housewife are no longer enough for him to sustain interest in his online fantasy world? Will he start doing this to your son? Will he decide he needs to kill you off ""for drama""? At what point will he have overwritten you and your life so badly for his own gain that you've had enough?  

What happens when kids at your son's school make the connection and start telling him all the shit his dad is saying about his mom on the internet?  What is your son learning from all of this? I can't even imagine. "

489,"It's the standard sexual entitlement/ ego logic. If certain men believe that something sexual will happen, but then it does NOT happen, they feel that something has been unjustly taken from them.

491,"Neither of you handled that well.  You need to let her have space when she asks for it, with an agreed on time to talk about it later.  She needs to learn how to listen actively and engage in conversations that are proactive and can solve the issues at hand.

GO TO COUNSELING."
492,"This this this. This isn't about calls vs. texts, except for the part where he's using his call check-ins and the fact of calling vs. texting and his pissiness about the whole thing to control you."
493,Keep the love there bro and I hope it works out for you. I[26m] was like you and my ex-girlfriend[26f] was a little thicker but to me she is still the most beautiful person I have ever had the pleasure of holding. I would tell her all the time. When she broke up with me in July she said she wasn't happy with her self and she was being unfair to me. She said I was her best friend and she cared for me deeply but she needed to love herself first before she could belive some one could love her. Do what you can to helper her understand that she is beautiful but she also needs to see it for herself. Again I wish the best for you.

495,"I 100% agree with this comment! This hits it on the head. He likes her friend and is fantasizing about her. People are saying guys do this, but I could maybe see SINGLE guys do this...not in a relationship with your girlfriends friend. That's crossing a boundary. 
"
496,"I think it does cross a line a bit, I'm not so naive that I'd expect my partner to NEVER imagine women they find hot while masturbating. It's not something I like to think about, but I definitely know it happens. There is just something worse about getting an actual picture up, staring at it, and wanking."
497,"I get why this seems a little disconcerting to you, but it's definitely not a red flag or something that should cause you to question your relationship.  

You're missing something really important when you look at the issue like this:

&gt;He is so special to me, yet all the evidence point out that I am just another crush of his.

Maybe you WERE just another crush of his.  But now you ARE so much more than that.  

It doesn't matter if back when you two met he had crushes on pretty much all the girls he knew, and the only reason he started dating you instead of any of the others was because you were the first one who gave him a shot.  Because having a crush is just a starting point, and over time he developed MUCH stronger and more lasting feelings for you.  He got to know the real you, not just the idealized crush version.  He fell in love with you.  He decided he wanted to spend his life with you.  

Once upon a time he might have been equally interested in a number of girls.  But he didn't do any of those other things with them, and the odds are good that even if they had given him a shot it wouldn't have worked out.  The vast majority of people you meet are not someone you could fall in love with and build a life with.  If you two have that then you *are* special to him, and that's what you should be focused on."
498,"Don't marry her. It doesn't mean you have to leave her, you can always make that decision when you feel it's right, but don't marry her.

She needs to hear your reservation and you've got to make it clear this isn't a blackmail or bargaining chip situation. You simply don't feel comfortable making that kind of commitment with this part of your relationship struggling the way it is. Sex isn't the most important thing in a relationship, but it is important in a relationship.

Yes, she has PTSD. Yes, she's going to a therapist. But, as you said, it's not getting better, it's getting worse. None of us are experts and people recover from issues in their own time, giving them that time and space is a noble thing to do. At a certain point, however, you can't keep your life on pause in the hope that things will get better. At the very least, you can't continue to make further commitments."
499,"&gt; She's a tenant, not your friend. You aren't living in a dorm anymore and you'll find roommates from now on who don't care to be your friend.

Yuppp, I was like her when I was in college renting a house with other woman i didn't know. I already had friends/ a bf and I wasn't interested in building relationships with anyone new at the time, just do school and get out. They were also in different life stages as me as they were a bit older. That being said I wasn't rude to them but I did my own thing and didn't engage in convos outside of house stuff. They were like op as that they didn't want me there anymore as a result but they also took a lot of offense to it and made the living situation awful and would gang up on me in house meetings/I would always be the last to know about anything important. Like shit sorry I just needed a cheap room to sleep at not a new friend group"

Telling you to shut up is absolutely out of line, and you were right that it bothered you. Please down waste any more time with this clown."
506,"Well at this rate maybe he will lose his second son due to not ensuring he is safe around his first son,  so he is effectively choosing one son over the other. 




I don't even have children and I can already tell you I would be livid. I would leave. Your son absolutely needs to come first - would you punish your son if the positions were swapped? I certainly hope you would - because any child who hurts another should be made to know their actions are absolutely not okay. He is old enough to know better. At the very very least he needs to genuinely apologise.  




My ex had two kids,  the little girl was favored. She used to do things like pick up the TV remote and throw it at her brothers head. He was eight,  the girl was two. He would cry and their father would come in and comfort the girl. I grew to despise that little girl - she was evil, which is bad on my part since the ones in the wrong are the parents. Eventually I left,  I couldn't stand her father's behaviour towards his son (he was also hugely abusive towards me,  but that was my biggest issue) I thought it was utterly revolting and they weren't even my children! I lost all respect for him. "
507,"If she cheated on you, and was groveling at your feet to get you to stay, I'd say this likely wouldn't work. The fact that its you practically groveling at her feet tells me it absolutely won't work. Go see a divorce lawyer and get your ducks in a row. Serve her papers and leave her. Don't leave the house, and transfer all finances into your name. Take her off any joint credit cards or close them. Get all evidence of cheating you can. Start the process at least. Then, to her, it becomes real. Right now, she is stuck in fantasy land. She needs a cold, hard dose of reality. She is destroying her family. Make it perfectly clear that this is 100% her doing. She lied to you. She betrayed you. She fucked another person, not you. Regardless the reasoning, she betrayed her vows. If she wanted to fuck around, she could have come to you to end things. She didn't. She doesn't respect you or your marriage. I don't see any coming back from this. Your priority should be you and your kids. "
508,"Exactly. Poor Jen.

Maybe she is comfortable with this group and comes along as an attempt to be more physical and lose weight? 

Yes, maybe this group isn't entirely right for her - she probably is aware of this too. But maybe it makes HER feel better to be involved and try to do these things. Maybe she is being forced into these things. Maybe someone in your group should talk to her and how she feels.

It seems like everyone is going through her partner. She has a voice too."
509,"""Give him a chaaaaance!"" Um no. Why do i feel like OP's friends are the kind of people who, if Ben actually DID end up attacking or stalking OP, would turn around and be like ""Well OP why did you lead him on? Why didn't you leave when he started being creepy?""

Seriously OP trust your instincts and end things with this guy. "
510,"I guess I also don't ""see"" it. Like in the example I gave, I don't think she's talking back that badly. So what if she backtalks a little bit? I don't think it's a big deal, it doesn't bother me, and it's not that offensive (for an 11 year old.) I don't want to teach her to walk on eggshells around her dad, or to suppress her opinions. I'd rather her be outspoken and spirited than question herself or feel badly about speaking out. But I feel like that's the way she's being guided. "
511,How come you've posted before as a 21yo girl? Get a life dude(girl?)
512,"&gt; he's said he'd like to move in together in maybe 1 year

Well at least he's giving you a timeline and not trying to put it off.

You don't know that he *doesn't* want to wake up next to you every day, in all likelihood he's just being cautious.

I know it's repeated over and over again on this sub, but I really do believe in communication -- have you asked him why he wants to wait another year to move in?"

There's a laundry list of reasons to break up here and you didn't list any reasons to stay with her. "

516,"Thanks for all the responses everyone. I really got a lot out of it and have decided I am just freaking out right now. I think I've been letting my imagination run wild with my jealousy and the whole ""seeing what you want to see"" thing. We had a nice talk and so far have been hanging out like usual. Though moving forward I am going to focus on we are broken up now and to not worry what she is doing."

Most people want to have sex in a romantic relationship, and without stating how long you're really looking to wait, I'm assuming you want to wait a very protracted amount of time. You are going to have to go through a significantly higher number of potential partners to find what you are looking for, but at least you will find someone compatible."
519,"You ""accidentally"" downloaded Twitter, swiped right a bunch of times, and messaged your matches... 

Is your hand possessed? 

No?

You lost your job over this and nothing can be done? Is it because your name change was public record or something? She can't even get a slapnon the wrist for creepily contacting the school to get pictures of your kids? I mean, you reported her for stealing and her reponse has been to *retaliate*, and you can't do anyw legally about that? This doesn't count as defamation or something? This was a deliberate assault on your livelihood. "

Under the lease, you still owe rent, so you need to break it or you'll owe for next month, too. I would also seek your security deposit back once you do break it.

524,"It's also how you show you can ""hang with the guys"" in a male-dominated environment.

If y'all decided to try a relationship again, it's a new start.   Question - would it be any different if y'all got back together at 22 instead of 19..

 Hell, in many countries it'd be *illegal*!

I'd keep your distance. "

540,I got all of the recessive genes from our family so I have very different coloring than my father (and my mother and my siblings).

542,I don't agree with the wife letting them have it but I think the downstairs neighbours overreacted first. Who makes a complaint to the housing authority without even talking to your neighbour first? They escalated the situation prematurely. I would be angry too in the wife's position (albeit not angry enough to blast my downstairs neighbours if I want to continue living there).
543,"This is how it started with my ex. He was able to control himself in front of others because he actually cared how they perceived him. When we were alone, it was a different story. You should read ""why does he do that"" by Lundy Bancroft. I read it after my relationship was over but I wish I had read it sooner. It might be eye opening for you.

An abuser isn't abusive 100% of the time. I loved my ex, he was smart and funny. We had a ton in common and we looked like an ideal couple to others. But when we were alone, I was constantly walking on eggshells because I was terrified of saying or doing the wrong thing. It got so bad I started apologizing for things I had no control over. If he stubbed his own toe, I apologized. If he was driving and missed the turn, I apologized (though if I pointed out the turn to him beforehand, he would have yelled at me that he didn't need my help.)

It starts with the rage in private and it scares you into complying and taking more on your shoulders so you can try to prevent the rage. You will eventually get so bogged down by this that it will be overwhelming but it still won't be enough to prevent him from raging. Nothing will we enough for him. He likes how it feels to make you cower into submission. He enjoys abusing customer service reps. That's not okay.

Eventually, the rage will be turned on you. I got out of my relationship got that far, but he did start hitting the wall or door while yelling at me, which was enough to scare me. He said he would never hit me, when I made it clear that hitting inanimate objects was not okay. I'm glad I got out before I got to see if that was true or not."
544,Nothing in theory. But if it's your most prized possession to the point you're considering leaving your flat share early because someone lost it then you might wanna start thinking about *why* vaping weed is so integral to your life.
545,That  is really sexist. Urgh.
546,"Yeah, it's very unlikely OP's wife contracted anything. Still worth it to get tested to put his mind at ease. Besides, if she's so cavalier about cheating now, who's to say she hasn't done it before. "
547,He's so embarrassed hr couldn't be there for that he's going out of his way not to be there for you now? Dude this boy needs a wake-up call
548,"You wil hurt your daughter more by staying together. She also needs a break from this ugly situation, and unhappy parents are a bad role model for her.

End this."
549,"My advice is to be honest. Because if he finds out later, after you're married, and reacts badly, it will be so much worse because of divorce.

My advice to minimize damage, based on my own experiences and what I've read, giving him too much detail is a bad idea. He is not entitled to it (think about it, if you two had a sex life and you told other people graphic details without his permission, wouldn't that be an invasive betrayal?) Guys who won't judge you based on your sexual past will not desire to know explicit details. Guys who demand to know things like frequency, positions, time frames, stuff like that... they're asking those questions with an idea of what the 'right' answer is, and you're not going to be able to give that right answer. 

If it were me, I'd feel comfortable sharing number or partners, if protection was used / what kind, and when I was last tested for STDs. Also if there was any nonconsensual stuff, I would want my partner just to know that it happened, because it's a trauma thing, and you should be able to share that type of thing.

So if he is upset that you're not a virgin, it's important to establish why he feels that way, and then you work from there. Sometimes guys raised in religious environments believe that women are ruined or dirty for having sex outside certain parameters. If he's one of those guys you need to know before you get married.

Please understand what follows is not an attack on your religious beliefs. But, in a relationship, sexual compatibility is very important. There's a subreddit, deadbedrooms, that outlines what life is like for couples with mismatched libidos. Or if someone has a fetish that the other person cannot abide. It can't think of a way to sort that stuff out without actually having sex (the libidos, anyway.) Fetishes are hard because if shame is involved, people aren't always forthcoming.

Perhaps you guys have already considered those angles, and my bringing it up is unnecessary. It's good to talk about your expectations on sexual frequency before you commit to marriage. And talk about what if you're mismatched. Will one of you be able to live with less sex than you want? Will one of you be able to live with a partner seeking sex outside the relationship if no fulfillment... er, well, this is probably way ahead of the issue, now. It doesn't hurt to think about worst case stuff, IMO. But maybe I'm suggesting more than necessary."
550,"&gt; I just really don’t think he understands how this whole situation is affecting me even though I am constantly explaining to him how much I hate everything about this. 

He understands, he just doesn't care. 

&gt; How do I make it clear to him that this is NOT working for me without him just brushing it off as a minor disagreement?

By dumping him. Seriously. This guy doesn't give a fuck. "

Fine with me...but asking her to put in an extra 10-15 hours a week to help our lives run more smoothly and put in as much effort as much me doesn't seem unreasonable to me. 


Also, its a job in the loosest of definitions. She doesn't really consider it a job. She works there because her friend got promoted to manager there, and basically uses it to hang out and pass time cause she got bored being at home.

But crazier things have happened, and if you say you're not idealizing her and you say you have a lot of dating experience, then you already know how to get over her. You know it's just time, leaning on your support system, and self-care.

Good luck."
559,"&gt;is there a chance you might regret cutting her out? 

I honestly can't say. Even two weeks after the fact, I still find her repulsing and unsuitable to be allowed anywhere near my children. Maybe that will fade. Maybe it won't. 

The thing is, once I remove the familial connection between us, if she was just a spouse of one of my friends, I'd have no problems with saying goodbye forever. No second thought. But there is that connection between us, no matter how much I find it distasteful at the moment. 

&gt;I personally am just big on second chances

I'm not opposed to either. But you have to show you actually earned those. 

Her behavior, the length of her affair, her duplicity and constant lying - I'm not sure how to see her as anything else but an ugly old woman, whom I absolutely do not want anywhere near me or my children. "

One of two things will happen.  

If he's a respectful person, someone who's prone to lots of physical touch but will respect when someone doesn't want  it, he'll apologize, never do it again, and will behave normally around you otherwise.  

If he's not respectful, he'll protest or ask for more reasoning or tell you not to be uptight, etc. If so, he's an asshole and sexual harasser and you should immediately speak to the higher ups and/or look for another job."

573,"1) If he doesn't want to be with Lois, then he shoulkdn't be with her-- but he shouldn't ""leave her for you"". That puts too much pressure on you (your responsible for the break-up of his marriage! you have to make it work whatever happens or it will all be for nothing! All his future happiness on you!). And also, it's honestly kind of a sucky thing for him to do to his wife: ""I'm with you, but only because I don't have anything better, and I haven't felt properly in love with you for ten years. Yep, our youngest kid was two the last time I ""had feelings"" for you. I'd leave you like a shot if this younger woman says yes!""

He doesn't get to make you responsible for the end of his marriage. That's on him to do or not to do.

2) Okay, you do know you knew what you were doing as part of this? Like, you were definitely laying out the welcome mat for him. You were flirting with him, you were having what I would call an emotional affair leading up to this. 

3) Just-- it's very different being in a relationship with someone, then when they were your ~soul-mate~, and were treating you like... what did you say? That you'd ""never gotten the slightest inkling that he thought of me as more than the surrogate daughter way"". Well, you treat people differently when you're treating them as you ""surrogate daughter"" than your partner. Surrogate daughters, your job is to nurture them, to support them-- to keep them from the worst parts of you, to be the best possible self around them, because they're generally vulnerable in ways that you're protected. Your partner? They're the one that you're not always on your best behaviour around. They deal with you when you're weak and petty, when you're not a good example to anyone. They argue with you about directions, they've heard that same joke from you a hundred times. They love you and will care for you, and look after you, but they know you at your worst. You know the edited version of him, the one that enjoys being that person to you. 

4) Honestly, sometimes people are more attractive because of everything that goes with the, that they represent-- including having what looks like a perfect, sorted life, with a loving relationship of 20 years. That's part of them, and gosh, it's an attractive part-- someone capable of that, someone who can be everything that they are. 

I'm not saying he doesn't have fine qualities, but he's also someone that's spent, according to him, ten years in a relationship with a woman he doesn't ""have feelings for"", and that's not for the kids, that's for comfort, because it was easier to be with her than to break up. Or maybe now, it feels like that to him, and a year ago, or a year from now, he'll feel differently about it.


maybe you really love each other, but love doesn't make a relationship work alone. Fundemenatlly, I think you need to separate what you feel, from what he chooses to do."

576,"I agree. So why are you asking us? ;) (sorry couldn't resist)  

But seriously. Don't text him. He's busy. Probably with someone else who is getting the priority treatment. Don't worry about it. Don't send the passive aggressive and annoying ""It was so great to meet you. All the best to you."" kiss off text. Just move on, quietly, with dignity like he has done. Not responding makes it clear.  

He has told you what you need to know. If he gave the wrong impression, you can be sure he will be contacting you soon to clear it up. If he contacts you again with another semi flirty non committal text you can either 1 ignore it or 2 tell him how you feel.  Try not to waste too much mental energy on someone who is not being considerate of or thinking of you.

577,"I think part of it might be that you're assuming you're too different from other girls, which just isn't true. For example, tons of people love shows like Rick and Morty (me included, and I'm a girl). Don't rule us all out!

I've had problems making friends as well, but I know that more often than not, people enjoy other nice people. Try finding groups with similar interests by going to events/joining clubs/etc, and just introduce yourself and ask what's up. 

Keep in mind all of the red flags you've noticed in the past, things that might show some girls are really drama-centric or that guys are just trying to sleep with you.

Basically, give people a chance and keep an eye out in case of creeps. Good luck!"
578,"Get a lock for your room, you can avoid her there (lock the door after you) when she comes over. Cook foods she will probably hate. Steamed vegetables, rice, no oily stuff, salads with only lite dressings available, tofu, soup broths...lots of asian dishes that lack meat and make dishe with tons of steamed/boiled vegetables- there are lots of recipes there...they will come over less if they hate the food. This advice actually worked for someone else I talked to who had a moocher problem (someone coming over to eat for dinner, uninvited). Get rid of all junk and instant food or at least hide it in your locked room. Pretend you're trying to eat healthy :)

If she calls you while you're driving, just ignore her calls. Say you don't pick up the phone while driving anymore. You can even send her to a voicemail message: ""X is driving right now and values safety above phone calls, please leave a message and X will get back to you later"". Then don't listen to the message until after you get back home.

580,"I'm sorry but I don't like the idea of giving up on someone like you stated. Not sure if you didn't mean it like it's written. I agree her son may need to be evaluated or need extra help. But he needs to learn to ask for help - there were a lot of opportunities to do so from his teacher, mom, uncle or even his cousin. But he stole, lied and was going to screw his cousin over  (a zero since his assignment wasn't technically turned in). 
From his mother's account this is a problem of his own making. He lies about homework, ignores it and lies more. This is unacceptable behavior from anyone and he needs to know that in my opinion.

Edit to add -  to quell the downvotes...this was me. I was lazy and smart. I could pass most things without much effort but when I had problems with math in high school I hit a wall. Instead of studying I copied off my friend's homework and failed tests left and right. My parents were not as involved as OP seems to be but I got a ton of well deserved shit when I got a 37 on the midterm. 
My mom talked to my math teacher and they had me go into see her before school AND staying after school with her. I can say honestly Mrs. L went above and beyond for me and tutored me and helped me catch up before finals. My parents also called my math teacher and got a list of assignments I was behind on. So I would get home and sit at the dinner table and work on those.
I earned that 86 I got on my pre-calc final and honestly learned a lesson.  And the grounding my parents gave me for lying about homework lasted a long ass time. 
I only speak from prior experience of being a lazy punk. It would have been easy for Mrs. L to give up because I had no excuse for my behavior. But she pushed me to work through the hard things and not just give up or take a dishonest easy way out."

The only way you can get over it would be to distract yourself with useful hobbies. Listen to your favorite music, and go on a run until you can't breathe anymore.

602,"*Has* hepatitis B or *had* hepatitis B? Your risk factors vary accordingly.

&gt; If I am vaccinated, can I not catch it at all no matter what? unprotected sex?

If vaccination was effective (which is pretty much always), then yes, you're probably immune to hepatitis B. Discuss this with your doctor; if you have a partner with HBV, you can be tested for antibody levels and have the vaccine re-administered if necessary. 

&gt; If I'm not, is this something you can get by making out?

There's no evidence HBV can be transmitted in saliva alone. Kissing is not considered a means of transmission. ""Making out,"" depending on your definition, may carry risk depending on her and your oral health at any given moment. Discuss this with your doctor.

And if you're not vaccinated, you should get vaccinated. Even if you don't pursue this girl. Everyone should be vaccinated for Hep A+B unless there's a medical reason they cannot be. They're extremely common diseases, they can be horrible lifelong life-shortening diseases, and they're easy and inexpensive to prevent (through vaccination).

&gt; Is there still a chance to get it with protected sex? What about oral (giving and receiving)?

There's still some risk. Hep B is transmitted in vaginal fluid and blood, either of which may be easily and inadvertently spread to unprotected areas of your body. Female condoms may offer better protection (due to additional coverage and tidier removal) than male condoms for vaginal intercourse. Beyond condoms, you should also use gloves, dental dams, and other protection as appropriate (e.g. fingering or cunnilingus). There is no data on oral sex. Discuss this with your doctor. "

608,"I'm not really sure, I haven't asked him about it yet but maybe he thought it was something like me trying to say ""oh its not what it looks like"" or something? Idk"
609,"That's kind of why I think this.  He's, like, oddly over affectionate with her.  Not just holding her hand, or a quick kiss, or an arm around her.  It's hard to pin down but it's definitely NOT ""normal"" affection.  I mean some of it's obvious, like he'll sit there and rub her stomach, or try to put his arms around her and make it obvious to all of us he can't reach all the way around, stuff like that, but even without that, the affection is, like, fetishistic/worship-like rather than *loving*.  As I said it's hard to articulate what's off about it, but it's definitely something, because it was one of those things that everyone was thinking but nobody wanted to say until someone said it.  

I mean, maybe he just really likes the body type she has, but it's still just..... weird.  "

To just watch your partner cook, let them do the whole thing, let them finish and *then* say just say ""I don't feel like it"" is a bit rude, in my opinion. His reaction is just disinterested and unfeeling.

My boyfriend would say ""Oh baby thank you for cooking but chicken soup makes me gag, I'm sorry!""
And then I'd say ""I'm sorry hun I should have asked what you wanted!"" and it'd all be fine.

I dunno about this ""Nup not hungry"" and then ""Stop making a big deal"" shit. It seems weird and cold."

614,"She doesn't want to go out with you. Be cordial, but do not ask her out. "
615,"I can definitely feel your pain on this one. I came out of a 2 year relationship at the start of this year (after he cheated on me, so holla at a girl with self-esteem issues) and entered the nebulous world of online dating really for the first time.

First of all, I'd say make sure you've chosen the right dating website. I initially and unwisely, on the recommendation of a friend, started off with Tinder. 

I found that not only are most of the guys looking for sex, but it's just a really terrible way to meet people because you're judging them primarily on the way they look. I much prefer a meaty bio to a selection of selfies. In the end, I never met anyone off of Tinder. 

I switched to POF (Plenty Of Fish) after a few months and, within a month, I got asked out on 3 different dates by 3 lovely guys! It was kind of a windfall really. This was mainly due to the fact that I had taken the time to really look at their bios and they had sent me lengthy, interesting messages.

&amp;nbsp;

So my second piece of advice for weeding people out before they make it to first date stage is: look at his first message and how he presents himself. This is the first impression he wants to make on you and it's crucial.

Avoid messages that simply say 'hey' or 'how's it going?' because I usually found that these came from the guys just looking for sex. You want to look out for messages that say something like 'I saw this on your bio and found it really interesting' or 'I also share an interest in [x]'.

That way, not only do you know that you share common ground with this person, but you also know that they're willing to put effort into their interactions with you. They've seen your photos, (more importantly) they've read your bio, and they've decided they want to make an effort to get to know you better.

In short, they don't want to know what sandwich you ate today or whether you're going to the gym tonight. They want to know what makes you tick.

&amp;nbsp;

This leads me on to the third stage: the actual physical dating part. So, once you've exchanged a few messages with a guy, gotten to know them, realised you quite like them, and they (hopefully!) ask you out (or you ask them out, it's the 21st century!), it's time to go on that all important first date. 

I'd recommend cutting the 'messaging' stage to a week at most. That's plenty of time to make up your mind about whether you actually want to meet them or not, without leaving it for so long that it becomes awkward or weird.

In my opinion, it's the first 3 dates that are crucial and this is the time when you really need to stay vigilant for those warning signs. Keep **all** of those 3 dates to public places. 

Start off casual, with a café meet-up perhaps. Second date, up the ante with an evening cinema/restaurant date. Third date can be anything you like, so long as its a public place. And do **not** meet up for a drink in a bar, no matter how tempting this may seem. Alcohol is gonna cloud your judgement and send the wrong message.

&amp;nbsp;

So now, you're on the date. What should you be looking out for? This is where it gets tricky because everyone is different and we all want different things from our prospective partners. However, there are a few universal warning signs to watch out for.

How does he dress? If he's dressed well, it shows he wants to make a good first impression on you. If he's dressed shabbily or looks unkempt, it shows that he may not care what you think of him.

How much time does he spend on his phone? As a personal rule, if a guy cracks his phone out for anything short of an emergency on any of the 3 crucial dates, he gets the boot from me. 

A guy spending a lot of his time could show a number of things, from him messaging lots of other girls to him wanting to keep tabs on the football score. However, it can only ever truly mean one thing: I'm more interested in this tiny electronic device than I am with getting to know you.

How often does he talk about himself versus how often you talk about yourself? Ideally, in any conversation, you want to hit that nice 50:50 balance. Note how often he asks you questions and how deep these questions are.

Guys will talk about themselves **a lot** to try and impress a girl (it's called peacocking), but they will also ask a lot of questions because they want to get to know you. Watch out for guys who just talk about themselves and don't seem terribly interested in what you have to say. They're more in love with themselves than they are in you. 

&amp;nbsp;

And finally, we come to the physical affection aspect of dating. When is it okay to kiss? At one point should we get freaky? This is again different for everyone, but I usually follow two cardinal rules:

1) No kissing (on the lips) until the 3rd date;

2) No sex until we've agree explicitly to be exclusive (usually after 1 to 2 months of dating).

&amp;nbsp;

Sorry this is so ridiculously long! To finish, I'll just give you a brief example from the guy I'm now with, who I met through POF.

&amp;nbsp;

The first message he sent me was all about my bio, talking about how funny he found it, how interested he was in some of the places I had traveled to, how he wanted to know more about my hobbies. It was bubbly and full of humor. It instantly and effortlessly caught my eye, in spite of the fact that his photos were blurry and I couldn't quite tell what he looked like!

&amp;nbsp;

Our first date, we went to an arcade, got slushies, and played air hockey. We ended up spending about 4 hours together and again, it felt effortless. We laughed uncontrollably and had a fantastic time. At the end of the date, he immediately asked me when we would next see each other.

&amp;nbsp;

Our third date, we went out to dinner and, as we walked back to my car, he cupped my face in his hands and asked politely to kiss me. I found this particularly impressive, because it was both romantic but also very respectful. Respect is one of the major things that you'll notice will differentiate a guy who's actually into you and a guy who just wants to bang you.

&amp;nbsp;

After two months of dating casually, I told him that I'd stopped seeing other people and I'd like it if he did the same. Turns out, he already had! We arranged to have a city break together, to make our first time more special.

&amp;nbsp;

On the city break, he asked me to be his girlfriend before we had sex. And the rest is really history!

&amp;nbsp;

So, in short, you can find love online, but you just have to be that bit more patient and strict with yourself. It sucks a tonne and you'll meet a lot of frogs (trust me, the other guys I saw before my boyfriend were nightmares), but it's worth it in the end.

Best of luck to you and let us know how you get on!"
616,"You sound like a shit friend. You insulted her, I've read your post three times and can't see how, where or why you think _you_ were the victim here."

618,"Oh, come off it. Don't pretend that you wanting to go show up and force her to deal with you is about anything else but you continuing that selfish behaviour. Your behaviour in the first place made it clear that you don't *really* give a shit about her feelings.

She is entirely capable of calling you if she decides she wants to talk to you. If she doesn't, it's because YOU are the one who hurt her and being around/talking to you **may very well make her hurt even more**. Just because YOU think talking to her will make YOU feel better doesn't mean it's the same for her.

Quit being so selfish, kid. You got into this situation by only considering your own wants and needs and prioritizing them over hers; how in the world can you be so dense as to think CONTINUING that sort of behaviour is the right thing to do here?

Leave her alone unless she contacts you. I know that apparently this is a difficult concept for you, but you are not the person who gets to make the decision about whether or not you remain in her life. Let her make that decision.

620,"That's what I was thinking when I initially read this. His brother was overdue with rent and wasn't even around, so he was worried about contacting their older sisters because they're busy with school.

To be honest, they either need to suck up the burden of caring for a young teen and and going to school if OP is being so badly treated by their shitty brother. Or they need to place him with other family or friends. OP's older brother has no business being in charge of the welfare of so much as a goldfish, let alone his little brother."
621,"You seem to have no empathy or respect for your boyfriend. You disrespected the shit out of him twice in one night. 

To be perfectly honest, if it were me, I'd dump you for it. "

623,"This. I've seen it blow up spectacularly, among colleagues and fellow students, too many times to count. 

And know, OP, if this man is comfortable breaking the boundaries with you, he'll do it again when you are the girlfriend. We professors never run out of young, wide-eyed students for whom we could feed our ego, should we be shitheads. You'll never be secure. God, his poor girlfriend has no idea. "
624,"&gt; It is absolutely bonkers how out of touch and socially inept this shit is.


Seriously. 


I'm just going to go up to her and say, ""Hey, I got your care package, and while I appreciate the gesture, I think you should probably focus on guys your own age."""
625,I want to google but I'm skerred...
626,"I do not think you read what I wrote.

627,"&gt;First of all, I do not want to hit the lawyer. Don't ask me to do that.

Well, luckily for you, you're not actually married yet, so you don't need a lawyer.

That said, everyone is going to tell you the relationship is toxic/shallow, and at the very least you should put it on hold if not break up"
628,"Yes, but he has no right to undermine and interfere, either"

630,"He did that on purpose! He's 20, not 2. He knows that was a horrible thing to do and say. He's not trying to make you go to the gym, he's testing to see if he can control you and push your boundaries. If you go to the gym because of that it will be another thing next. You're lucky he showed you what he's like only a month in. Move on. FAST. "
631,"The Sunk Cost Fallacy. The Misconception: You make rational decisions based on the future value of objects, investments and experiences. The Truth: Your decisions are tainted by the emotional investments you accumulate, and the more you invest in something the harder it becomes to abandon it.

I think this is what you're dealing with here.  You made an initial emotional investment in this guy and then took him back, knowing he was bad news.  Now that you have him back, and he's still bad news, you're holding on instead of cutting your losses.  "
632,Would it be fair to say that's still primarily a communication issue? Like how to redirect a conversation or be firm that the topic is off limits? You could ask your question that way perhaps. 
633,"I think i have figured out that I need to be more specific about gifts that I want.

634,"He almost certainly isn't on the birth certificate. In most (all?) states in order to put a father on the certificate, if you're not married to him, he must sign a statement acknowledging paternity. If he doesn't sign such a statement, paternity has to be established through court procedures. 

The problem is at least some states she could establish paternity and ask for child support later, and in ALL states if she ever had to get welfare or food stamps the state would come down very hard on her to name a father. "
635,And make your Facebook private for fucks sake
636,"&gt; You can tell he is just so proud of himself for playing me. Always gives me a smug smirk and a small laugh.

What do you do in response?

I ask because I have a friend who was in almost the exact same situation recently (except it was at a workplace instead of a school) and, while I think the way she responded was immature, it definitely worked. 

She turned it around on him. She told the co-workers she considered her friends that she was the one who cut it off with the guy instead of the other way around. She told her friends that he was weird/awkward in person, awful in bed, and had a tiny dick. From then on, whenever they would walk past this dude and he'd smirk or laugh or whatever, they'd do it back to him tenfold. So there he is, walking towards a group of four girls (one of which is my friend, the girl he had sex with once and never spoke to again) thinking he's hot shit and giving her a smug smirk, and then all four girls would start laughing/giggling/pointing right back at him. She said he did it twice before he started actively avoiding her and the friends. 

Just remember: this dude is a total douchebag. Someone who obtains happiness/fulfillment from banging someone and then rubbing it in their faces that he knows they wanted to bang him again but he ignored them. He's a shitty person who views women like objects and he gets whatever comes his way."
637,"he has a girlfriend.  you should leave him alone.  if/when they break up (and they likely will give the ages here), then you can make a move.  but don't be that girl who moves on guys who are in relationships."
638,"Not a relationship problem, this is all in your head.

Look, boobs aren't like magic sacred fairy parts or something.  They're part of a body, and bodies sometimes collide.  You didn't feel her up, you didn't exploit your proximity to cop a feel, you didn't leer.  You just bumped.

If she felt uncomfortable you would have noticed."
639,"Agree completely. 

It would be marginally different if they'd been friends since childhood. But even then it wouldn't be cool since she's in a relationship. "
640,"Thank you. I may just take you up on that, as I have a feeling that I'll be needing all the support I can get."
641,"Dude, try to accept that she has broken up with you. 

When people break up, the reasons they give rarely reflect real life, it is just some BS either (a) to avoid hurting you, or (b) to hurt you.

She had to give some reason, apparently, and she chose one that you cant discuss or change. 

Let it go. *You* **can't** fix this, because either (a) it is not a real issue, just an excuse, or (b) it is a HUGE fucking great issue that would require an army of shrinks a lifetime to fix


EDIT: 

&gt;UPDATE -- we are back together and she's taking things pretty serious! 

yeah, I totally believe that"
642,"""Never bolt your door with a boiled carrot."""
643,"&gt; in general, you shouldn't expect other people to behave the way you would behave

This is really really important, OP!! When you feel close to someone, it's easy to expect what you might call emotional symmetry. But people have their own ways of doing things, and that's perfectly fine. The important thing is how you two communicate about those ways of doing things. "
644,"You're making that up. The only thing he mentioned about the sex (that OP actually quotes) is that she might get AIDs. 

Hyperbolic, maybe. But since he's given her an STD before and he is an unstable alcoholic, not an unfair concern to raise. 

And the fact that she's 32 isn't really relevant, considering she still lives with her dad. If anything, her age is going against her as she really should have her shit together more in her early 30s. "
645,"I hope this comment doesn't get buried, because i have honest heartfelt advice for OP:

Can you get him a standing appointment with a tutor every day after school if you're working?  Some schools don't charge extra for them. And if you school does and money is tight, there are other ways.  For example, my parents would hire a local community college student to watch my brother and i after school when we were too old (and way too proud!) for a babysitter.  The college kid was explicitly instructed to be a homework proctor for at least an hour each afternoon, and then was available to give us help if needed.  It's a relatively cheap way to provide structure for Zane without making him feel like he has a babysitter, which at his age would be mortifying."
646,"Yep.

647,"why would someone lie about something like that.  I mean, it's not like you're not going to notice when you meet :/"
648,"I've heard people speak of totalling multiple cars, and that doesn't stop the rationalizations. Each one is magically someone else's fault.  

I might choose not to associate with someone who is a dangerous driver, and I might report someone who is an immediate threat to others, but I'm not going to waste my breath on an obviously doomed mission. Like in many other areas, the same knowledge you need to be a competent driver is the knowledge you need to realize you're not one. Very very few people believe themselves to be anything less than awesome drivers."
649,"I guess part of me wants to understand the fact they were together for 5+ years, so he was a significant part of her life, and it might be hard/long to get fully over him?

I worry and wonder if I'm making excuses for her now. "
650,"&gt;  Hell I even offer to drive my cleaner home because I know how much he appreciates an extra hour with his family vs sat on public transport.

This made me smile. That's very awesome of you!"
651,"Was marriage in the picture during this process? It seems like this guy is willing to stay with you for better, but not for worse. It seems to me he wanted to have you over, but he didn't want to be stuck with you - in terms of you moving in (or marriage).

He needs to get professional help. His lifestyle is tearing him down, as is his pride which keeps him from asking for help. Honestly, I think you need to start expecting a few things from him. Don't let him treat you like trash. If he's depressed, too busy to be with you and not looking for help, you can do better (edit: than him).

Btw - If Cordelia Fitzgerald is your real name I'd consider reposting this under a nickname. For all you know he might be roaming Reddit right now."
652,And that's not even as bad as the OP who went on vacation and came back to find her in laws had remodeled her kitchen and took out a load bearing wall. Talk about overstepping some major boundaries. 
653,"You're not wrong contemplating divorce. If this is a deal breaker for you, it's a deal breaker.

But don't do something you might regret. You don't necessarily have to make a choice right now. You can take some time to digest. 

There's a lot going on here. It was a five-month affair, but it was so long ago. She didn't tell you and *still denied it when you had proof,* but she has cut contact with him. She broke your trust, but you have an otherwise happy marriage. 

It has to be up to you to decide if you want the divorce or if you want to save this. If you want to save this, I strongly suggest marital counseling.

But no, to answer your question, you are absolutely not wrong for contemplating divorce."
654,"Oh honey, there is a phrase for what he is doing. Actually two phrases. ""Keeping one foot out the door"" and ""Keeping his options open.""

15 years ago, I was 30 and in your shoes. I had been with my guy for 4 years, was starting to want an engagement ring. ""Baby fever"" kicked in 2 years later. 

My guy was like your guy. He wanted to live together, be committed, but not get married, split everything 50/50 and 'wasn't ready' for marriage or kids with me. I adored his family, particularly his nephew and grandparents. They all loved me. He had a dozen aunts and uncles, cousins, huge close family. I wanted in. They wanted me in. Too bad he didn't. It was a huge part of why I clung to that relationship so hard. How did it play out?

He was never willing to marry me or have children with me. There was always an excuse why we couldn't. (We need better jobs/more in savings/better health insurance/to fix up the house etc etc). I begged. Pleaded. Cried. Got physically sick from the stress, the closer I got to that magic baby cut off age of 35. Had hives. Panic attacks. Thought it was too late to start over if I wanted kids, so I stayed. The relationship turned horribly toxic. I was terrible to him, because I was just so ANGRY he had strung me along for so long. He was terrible to me in return. No one could stand to be near us, because it was evident how much we disliked each other, but still stayed together.

When I finally went to therapy and got past it, things got better. Finally, at 42, he was 'willing to get married and/or have a baby, if that was still what I wanted."" Oh yeah. Go pick myself out a ring. I can pay for it with his credit card. Yay? How romantic.

By this point, I could no longer imagine having sex with this man, let alone having a baby with him, if it were still biologically possible. Way too much anger and resentment. Now I'm 45. Never been married, no kids, in a committed relationship for 19 years. That I will never get back. Our relationship won't survive it. For the past year, I have been quietly separating things and setting him up to move out. Oh yeah. And it was my house before we met, his name was never on the deed. Guess how that one is going to play out?

I really, REALLY hope you don't end up like me. Because it sucks. No guy should have to be brow beaten into marriage and kids. You deserve a guy that 1000% wants both of those things with you. Don't waste any more time with this guy. Believe him when he says he is not ready, and doesn't know when/if he will be. I hope to see an ""I left him!"" update in your future. {{internet hugs}} Best wishes, and good luck."
655,So your definition of PDA and your boyfriends are very important here. You have said holding hands is an intimate act and doing it publicly is uncomfortable to downright hard limit for you. This is going to be something that is hard for a great many people to understand. Your boyfriend may be one of them. Please think about talking to a therapist about boundaries and how to communicate them with others and yourself and your aversion to basic human interaction in public.   
656,"Fellow military wife here also... this advice is spot on. It's the same for all of us, and the nature of the beast, unfortunately. My hubby said it's the same for him, when he returns. I'm usually thinner and the kids have inevitably grown. And then there's the adjustment period of him getting used to 'normal' life, and you getting used to sharing your personal space. 

My hubby is always desperate for human contact/affection because he's gone months without even touching another person. But what works for us is taking it slow. We basically 'date' for that first week and ease ourselves back into a close physical relationship. It keeps our relationship fresh and fun, but by the end of that week, we're pretty much back to where we were when he left. Just don't put yourself under pressure - this is completely normal within our context as military wives! "
657,"If he is non negotiable on this imagine what he'll be like in the future when buying a house or on how to raise kids. Seems like a big ol red flag to me, I'd be wary. "

Furthermore, you can't melt her. she has to let herself melt, which she's clearly not doing. 

How can you help her? dunno. How can you help you? get yourself out there, get some friends, or spend time with friend you already have. Get yourself some therapy because you sound like you're struggling. Break up with your girlfriend. "

Could also be that there are other areas in their relationship where stuff like this goes on... Or OP just doesn't like having to treat his gf like a five year old. I'm not seeing in the post why she can't run out to get her own lunch. "
666,"I think introspection is pretty helpful for me, so I'll do that writing.

As far as leaving her, I really don't think I could do it since I know I can get through this and what we can be together. But I do want to do what's best for her; going to give it a little time and see how she feels."

670,"&gt;You need to have a conversation with him. Ask him why he didn't include you when he was planning the trip, did he assume you'd just go with what he planned?

edit: I'm not even condemning your views I'm just baffled that you can't see that the two of you are incompatible in a way that's not likely to be resolved and you don't even understand why she feels the way she does.  I don't get how you're surprised and I don't get how you think somehow she's being unfair."
674,"You had a snippy conversation at the end of a stressful day. Take some time, breathe, let go of the frustration and anger.

Then sit down and have a serious conversation about how you two want to handle financial obligations going forward. Money issues are one of the biggest reasons couples break up. "
675,"To be honest, I did know, at least to a degree, what I was getting into. "
676,You're welcome. I would also prepare for her to not want anything to do with you as well. You lied about a pretty big thing for your whole relationship together. 
677,"&gt; But you believe you are resigning her to roommates with no notice?

Better that than 2 years of a fake relationship with no romance and no future.  She's 28, if she wants kids I doubt she wants to waste another 2 years.  Though, based on his other comments, it doesn't sound like she has any motivation to change, despite knowing there's a problem."
678,"I (male) went through the same thing. Its honestly really hard to deal with. I noticed I was losing hair around 19 and it became quite noticeable a year or two later. You just lose so much confidence in yourself. Spent 2 years wearing hats. I don't like wearing hats. Very likely your BF wears hats because he is embarrassed of it like I was.

Once I took the plunge and used a pair or clippers without any guard #0, it looked so much better and I felt great about myself. The sooner he can do this, the better. "

680,Please leave her. The level of immaturity is staggering. 
681,"For the current question of ""Do I want kids now?"" the answer is a hard no. The question, however, is do you want kids in 5-10 years? To that question, she says ""50/50""

That doesn't seem unreasonable or strange to me. It also doesn't make her a hard no for the kids in the future question, just a hard no to the kids now question (and it sounds like her bf is also a hard no for the kids now question, so there is no incompatibility there)"
682,"You have your needs, you are justified in your request. He treats you a certain way and you don't like how it makes you feel - you want to feel better. Compliments (and less 'criticism') will improve the situation, so you ask for that. If he wants to be in a relationship with you, he is somewhat responsible for your emotions, to the extent of how his behavior affects you. If he doesn't want to do that, then this is a dealbreaker. If he doesn't want that responsibility, then a relationship with him is not in your interests. Honestly, his daily 'criticism' of you borders emotionally abusive."

For what it's worth, the guy I dated had ""relationships"" with several children that spanned years before we'd met *and the entirety of our relationship* and beyond, and I didn't know he was a paedophile until I hopped on his Facebook wall to wish him happy birthday and saw the news article about him being jailed.

Cult recruiting methods: 

x. Invitation to a non-threatening event (no hard sell right away)

x. Love-bombing (which can happen for quite some time)

x. Dangling ""The Prize"" in front of you (happiness, family, a place to belong, heaven, etc.) 

x. Extracting an agreement from you that you want the prize (a psychological hook). 

x. Shutting down your dissent by threatening to withhold the prize (with the threat of not having the prize and your newly found community of loved ones out of your life). 

x. Establishment of guilt (which you're probably aware of if you follow any major organized religion). 

x. Carrot/Stick (and again). 

and finally

x. Control of identity, information, environment

693,"Exactly. I look up videogame stuff for my bf all the time, and I've have to read it to him at a dull roar because he's half deaf, but he's always been very gracious about it because I was doing him a favour! 

Actually we both do it, because we're video game addicts who hate alt-tabbing out of games. "
694,"Wow. 

OK. That's... that's a lot to take in, a lot to deal with.

First, you get major points for settling the apartment/condo thing as well as you have. Seriously, you have a plan, and you're moving on it and that's good, so give yourself credit for that. 

Next, let's talk about who you have for support. OK, his family is off limits, and mutual friends are mostly off the radar, I assume. You have some acquaintances, some 'work-friends', so don't discount the support they might be able to offer.  Reach out to your friends back home, and (if appropriate) to your family to re-establish contact. Long-distance support is still support. 

OK, so you've got some folks to talk with, even if it's a mix of email, Facebook Chat, and semi-awkward conversations on break at work. Let's tackle the next thing. Schedule yourself some time to just be sad. 'Thursday, 6 pm until whenever - be sad'. Listen to sad music. Watch movies that make you cry. Buy a fluffy throw blanket and large stuffed animal and curl up on the sofa. Feel all the aching sadness you have in you. Cry until you're all snotty. Give yourself time to honestly feel all hurt you've got inside. 

OK, so at least one night a week, you're a snotty, red-eyed mess, and that's OK, because that's what that time is for. Let's talk a little about the rest of the week, specifically some self-care. Every week, once a week, I want you to do something nice for yourself. That can be a trip to the salon, or buying better headphones, or picking a coffee shop to hang out at and read the book/magazine that caught your eye recently. Once a week, you give yourself a trip to the ice cream boutique or the massage parlor or the independent movie theater that's showing a classic movie you loved as a kid. Once a week, *be kind to yourself*. 

If you can, exercise is good. 15+ minutes of cardio gets brain chemistry happier, and when you fall asleep quickly because your body is tired, you're not thinking about what happened. 

There are other things you can do, like picking up a new hobby or being a tourist in your own town, but that's for a little further down the road. Right now, take care of yourself.

Good luck. "

700,"After OP agreed to the travel at that time of year, once the arrangements are actually made, demanding BF cancel the trip and not see his family - or alternatively guilt him intensely over going - are actions many of us would see as abusive/controlling red flags.

701,"This is insane.  Why are you married to him?  You know this is some serious abuse, right?"
702,"Let me get this straight.....your girlfriend moved into a new apartment that did not allow pets, and proceeded to adopt a pet without making sure ALL the roommates were ok with it? Honestly I would never even dare ask my roommates if I could get a pet if the landlord didn't allow them!! Everyone who lives there could be evicted for that. You guys really screwed up big time and you better find a home for the pet you so carelessly and thoughtlessly adopted. And you're right, it's not the animal's fault. It's your girlfriends fault. Period, end of story. "
703,"Be gentle. Be aware she has serious issues and will need therapy eventually as cutting all contact with family is not normal behavior and implies she has been under the influence of someone very abusive. Her behavior may be erratic. Do not criticize, do not get her to open up unless it's her choice. Just let her know you're there for her and take it one day at a time. Maybe have her stay with you for a time as it may be harder for her to go to your parents. I would monitor her carefully though. Abuse is like an addiction sometimes and people can have relapses aka make sure she understands she's safe and has no obligation whatsoever to talk to that guy ever again. 

You're absolutely doing the right thing to pause work and life and go take care of her as she needs you. Just remember, take it slow. She may even have a hard time trusting you even though she reached out to you, just realize she's been under his influence for quite some time now so the journey back to normalcy will be slow and uphill."
704,"I'm really struggling to accept the results of Americans election and I feel depressed, hopeless, and scared.

No events ever held in your town? No bike paths you two can use? Did you google ""Free things to do in ___""?

You're also being silly by saying you ""exhausted"" them. Make them a tradition then - ""On Wednesday nights, let's go to the park and eat dinner under the stars!"" I can't imagine you've done every free thing in your area so many times that they're ""exhausted"" after 4 months."
706,"I cannot possibly see how this will end well. Your husband (whom you admit is your main priority) is not crazy about the idea. 

SO DON'T DO IT."
707,You say you have done your best to offer reasonable help but a two week stay in your one bedroom apartment is not going to fly
708,[deleted]
709,That kinda defeats the whole purpose....
710,"You're clearly in denial. At this point I don't blame him. It's very possible you came off as too clingy, especially since despite the fact you have PROOF he lied about not wanting a relationship with anyone, you refuse to believe it he didn't want one with you. What exactly are you looking for, here? "
711,"In my opinion we don't know too much else about her sense of humor from the description. This is the sort of thing I would do with my SO and he would burst out laughing... it really, really depends, but if OP was frightened by it, he has the right to set a boundary."
712,"Relationships are all about agreeing common boundaries. She's not wrong if she chooses camming, but he's not wrong either. 

If he sleeps with other people and she breaks up with him for it, was she ""being controlling"" over his body?  Nope, just a relationship boundary that was important to her. 

Different people have different boundaries; sounds like theirs just don't match up. "
713,"It doesn't matter what your feelings are. Relationships require TWO people and she's moved on. Your feelings do not matter anymore.

And no, you don't get to speak for her and what her feelings are. You don't get to say ""I know she feels blah..."" Nope. That's not your job.

It's over. Accept it."
714,"I don't think it's that big of a deal to repeat a few pet names, but maybe you should think of a couple new ones for this young woman. Mix them in with the best of the old, and keep making this relationship something unique from the last one."
715,You still need to use your words and tell he what you want.
716,Tell her if she threatens you you'll have to spill all about her relationships and the whole situation to protect yourself. 
717,"&gt; he feels bad when I have to clean his house for him

Not bad enough to keep his house clean without your help."
718,"When we spoke about it.  One thing she said was that she had no time to eat healthy.  So I proposed that I would cook for her.  Now I only recently spoke to her about this because last time we went shopping for clothes.  Nothing was fitting her, she had to go to the plus sizes.  I saw the sadness on her face.  I love this woman, I can't stand to see her upset like that.  So my first instinct is to fix things, help her where she struggles.  So that's what I did, I mentioned it, but things just blew up in my face."
719,You no longer have a girlfriend. Thank goodness.
720,"1) Her story about her friend's iPad is a lie. She was/is probably still using the app.

2) The app isn't buggy and her suggesting it in the first place means that she doesn't trust you, or as a way to prove she is trust worth and it's only done the opposite. Again she is lying to you.

3) She isn't that into you. This early on the relationship shouldn't be this hard. I don't think she has earned or trust and you are better off just moving on from someone who if they aren't cheating will still lie straight to your face. "
721,"I agree, OP admits that she's been a little too nice about it all. Something like what you suggest could be the wakeup call he needs to realize he's losing her. "
722,"Pretty much anybody would be mad about that. I know I would. That's his boundary, and you should respect it. "
723,"He slept with TWO girls?! Well your strategy now is to sleep with THREE dudes! /s

Do you see how this plays out? Learn from the experience, breakup and move on. "
724,"Yeah, I had that friend. She wants an accomplice, not what will make you happy. Ever. If you won't do the drugs and men she wants you to do, she'll make you/your life the problem. Been called a boring prude yet? That was a highlight for me as a bi woman in an open relationship. I guess my husband and I where just not cool enough, with our steady jobs, healthy child, and early bedtimes!"

726,"&gt; for ~~coming into~~ *breaking in* to your own house 

It was dark. Stepbrother did not recognize him, hence the video showing his horror when the light was turned on."
727,Sounds like she wants to divorce you because you cheated on her
728,"My dad would say similar things to me. He wasn't a creep (that I know of) just a sexist asshole who couldn't conceive of a woman dressing to please herself and assumed if you look ""sexy"" you're looking for sex (which is slutty and bad.)

Either way, let your mom know because you don't need to be dealing with his issues. 

Edit to explain: whether OP's dad is a creep or just a jerk (suuuper creepy comment on his part) what he's doing really is assigning OP with the responsibility of men's actions. He might be freaked out that his little girl is growing up. He might be a creepy predator. He might just be a run of the mill treats-objects-like-women type of asshole. Any of these don't excuse his creepy bad behavior. But it might give OP some insight into her next steps. "
729,"I dunno, I skip eating through work pretty much on the regular. Sometimes I have so much on the go I don't really have time to stop and eat, and I don't really even notice. "
730,"No, but op's son is a minor child and op is responsible for his mental well being. These are red flags for mental health issues or possibly a learning disavility, and it's op's job as mother to make sure those are evaluated and either ruled out or appropriately addressed.

Its also important because the goal of disciplining a child should be correcting behavior- and if there's an underlying cause, punishment alone wont help."
731,Or he's got a really specific threesome fantasy.
732,"What are some of your ""ultimatums"" or hard criteria for him?
E.g. no hard drugs, being willing to get a job etc.

I think ""not being BFF's with a sexually interested ex"" is on the list for most people.

Listen to you sister - and probably everyone else who isn't you (I bet even your ex knows this is inappropriate).

Edit to add: The reason he is giving you an ultimatum while you are not giving him any, is that you are doing something obviously inappropriate, while he isn't."
733,"I mean it's possible, I have no idea why she would say we were dating in the first place. "
734,"If you two are getting married, you're becoming a team. And he is already showing you he is unwilling to take one for the team to avoid an unnecessary $125 fine. 

Plus, he was the one *driving* your car. If he doesn't want to take responsibility when something happens, he doesn't ever get to drive it."
735,"Don't be so fast to trust, remember you could end up in a 2 vs 1 situation. You don't have a clue who this guy and his partner is. I don't think it is the best decision. Don't get in a car with him or them alone. If something seems weird, get the fuck out. Seems like you are going to do this anyway, so good luck. "
736,Get yourself and your daughter out of this shitshow. It's your job to protect your kid from this kind of mess. You are *failing* her. Go to Narc-Anon meetings and divorce your husband. You guys hit rock bottom ages ago.
