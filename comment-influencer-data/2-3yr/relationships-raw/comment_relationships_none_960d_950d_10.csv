0,To be honest it is none of your business. You need to stop meddling in other people's relationships. If they are happy to get married then who are you to delay it? 
1,"Totally, I get where you're coming from. It's really tempting to kind of put their noses in it like ""yeah it'd be great to see you guys if you all invited me out!! but you're not!!! so wtf??!?"" but you have to resist because nothing is actually going to come of it. they're not going to be real with you. maybe a few of them will mature and realize ""woah, we haven't been that cool to fakeassfriends, we should reach out to her,"" and then you can get your closure/understanding of why they're being weird, but you won't get that by initiating that sort of convo with them. but believe me I definitely understand &amp; sympathize, really anyone would react like you did. hope you find better friends that are on your level &lt;3"
2,"Yep.  It isn't a ""red flag"" issue, its multiple red flags.  To me the most important thing is how she handled it the next day.  Once you have calmed down, had time to think about what you did, and you decide to double down and try to excuse or justify your inexcusable behavior... To me that's the final straw."
3,"Dude, I would go APESHIT if someone purposely put my pet in that kind of situation! Why would he put HIS dogs in that situation? 

I'm not saying you should go nuclear on him, but I sure as shit would. "
4,"tell your wife the truth, it will be better in the long run. Tell her exactly what happened. it sounds like nothing more than a slip on her sisters part from sadness. I would however not allow her to be back in your house for a while. but definitely tell your wife. full disclosure is always best in these circumstances. Always. "

6,"Yep. You probably can't give yourself a sleek bob, but you can cut your own hair shoulder length or boy-short. I've done both and it's easier than you might think."
7,"I think she's just changing for the better to be honest. You're still in the same ""I'm young and I want to party"" mindset while it seems like she's trying to be healthier with her life. Nothing wrong with that, you two are just going down separate paths. I wouldn't be surprised if she eventually breaks it off with you because she's going to need friends with the same interest and life style. "
8,"""Recovered"" borderline girl here. She is BPD. Get the fuck out, please."
9,"&gt; she hacked my Facebook and Gmail accounts to delete the evidence

How did she do that? I have to admit, if I was him and you came to me with accusations that included that kind of claim... I'd get a little suspicious. It seems over the top. "
10,"If you were planning on keeping your finances separate after getting married, then it *would* sort of be like you were roommates.  As you've noticed, that works fine so long as your boyfriend restricts his lifestyle to that of someone your income level, and saves the rest.  It's not going to work the minute that he wants to increase his expenditures and expects you to live beyond your means.  It becomes a serious problem at that point.

I am confused as to why the two of you are even having this conversation, because normally I would take this to mean that your boyfriend isn't really ready to commit to marriage yet.  Which is fine, its just that I'm not sure why you're simultaneously talking about buying a house together.

The bottom line, your boyfriend's plan is quite possibly 'fair' from some sort of equal-investment perspective, but it isn't fair from many others.  You'll be contributing a greater portion of your income to the common good.  Your resources will be proportionally more tied up in the relationship.  You will be making more of a commitment.  Your economic future will be disproportionately impacted by the decision to buy a house.

Presumably, if he hopes to have children with you, he's planning on compensating you for the opportunity cost, and everything in his system is worked out to be scrupulously financially fair.  But in human terms, the plan requires you to take risks that he doesn't have to take, and it requires you to be more invested in the relationship than is required of him.
"
11,Clearly OP has been doing a slow fade. She just finally stopped the last activity. 
12," No. 

 My son did not leave once this situation started.

 I was bumped from my position due to nursing cuts, which meant I had to work on as an needed basis. I did not know my schedule in advance, so I was having to go in last minute on a daily basis, be it for 7 am, 3 pm or 11pm. Due to not knowing if I would get my hours or not, once at worked, I would stay for doubles or twelves when asked.

 This was becoming difficult for my son due to his need for structure and routine.

 This was a decision made well before this man moved in. It involved myself, him, and his therapists. Making a decision that was best for my son for the time being.

 it was not an easy decision. I did not however, choose to give this man a place a stay over my son. My son would be at my mother's until my work situation is sorted out be it he's here or not.

  As I said in another reply, most days I visit my son at my mother's house. On the days he is here, this guy is not. I also hide all traces of him living here.

 The reason I do this, is because my son knows the options of living here is available at any time. I do not want him to know there has been someone staying here, as I do not want to influence his decision at all. He knows his mother's house is his house, and I am not going to let a man being here make him uncomfortable.

 I realize I am in a bad situation, and obviously have some serious self esteem issues, but my son did not leave due to this man moving in. 

 There was never a point I chose this man's comfort over my son's."
13,"These kind of posts happen all the time. ""I would let you go through my phone!"" As if that gives them permission to manipulate you. Both sides have to agree on something like that."
14,"I think that buying a home, or potential home (as land is) is a different thing from buying a car or computer.  In her shoes, I wouldn't feel it was my place to tell you what to buy, in terms of goods.  However, if we were planning our lives together, I would definitely consider it my business where you were buying a house or land.   Your location is important to the continued life, or death, of the relationship.  Reverse the roles: if she bought a flat in Paris, and had plans that involved spending a lot of time there, would YOU be happy?"
15,"Maybe he loves you, OP. I don't know. But he regrets Sydney. 

I think that's going to consume your relationship."
16,"I so remember when I was in your position, so it's easy to get warm wishes and advice flowing! Good luck to you!"
17,"Just this week I got harassed by a creepy dude on a bus stop while I was wearing pokemon PJ pants and a baggy hoodie. 

You need to do some serious work on yourself instead of calling out your girlfriend for how she dresses. She has no self respect? Please, no self respect would be allowing you to give her a dress code. 

Edit: clarity"
18,"&gt; I think this is due to her past, and I believe that if we live together for long enough, and we do have a great relationship, that she will eventually want children.

Oh, fuck off.  Seriously, you're a complete tool for thinking you know her mind better than she does."
19,"Set clear boundaries with your boyfriend's mom. Have an honest conversation about her actions making you feel disrespected and violated. This conflict will set the tone for your future relationship. If you let her get away with it, she will continue to be in control of your possessions (including your potential wedding and children). If you are serious about the relationship with your bf, take care of it yourself. He hasn't been successful setting boundaries in the past, he won't be successful now. "
20,"It seems like this is what most of them would do, especially the aggressive ones like OP's. They are already oblivious just based on them insisting on coming at that important time. "
21,"I have to agree with a few other commenters here:

Are you happy? If you are that's great, but it's concerning that that doesn't come across at all from your original post.

I'm also slightly concerned that you talk about romantic and friendly relationships as ""owing people shit"". Personal relationships are also about what people can do FOR YOU. It's totally ok to not want/need those relationships, but as someone who struggled with depression for a long time and exhibited many of the antisocial behaviors you described, just take a look at your relationships with other people and make sure you are really and truly happy with the socializing you do now."
22,"well, it sounds like you are an adult baby."
23,It was also traditional for them to pay for the wedding. They seem to have conveniently forgotten that part.
24,"Telling people what they don't want to hear is difficult - they have a way of just not taking it on board.

I'm afraid you're going to have to persevere."
25,"She's way too flaky dude. She's ghosted you twice now, it is not meant to be. "
26,"Never ever ever ever let ANYONE push you into accepting her. Not your aunt, nor your uncle, nor your grandma, nor your BROTHER, NOONE.

If they pull out the guilt trip card? Tell them they dont care about your feelings at all. And you're THEIR IMMEDIATE FAMILY. Call them out on it.

Her part? What makes she thinks she deserves any of your time? any of your life? any of your attention at all?"
27,Try several different pictures then. Maybe start with your profile picture if it has the two of you in it? 
28,"He already said maybe in a year A YEAR AGO. Now he's doing it again. Guess what will happen if you agree to wait a year? He'll say the same thing. How do i know this? Because he's already done it twice. He doesn't want kids and is hoping to run out the clock until ""oh well, looks like you can't get pregnant!"" Sit him down and really have an intense conversation about it. Like, sit at a table when you have free time and don't leave until you both agree on a solid date to start trying. If he can't do that, there's your answer."
29,"He's a dumbass is why but I don't know. He just does stuff like that I guess, like rip down peoples Christmas lights or a joke he and his friends play is to push shopping carts in a ditch because they know the special needs guy who works for Kroeger is afraid to go in the ditch to get them. He's just kind of like that. I don't have a good reason why he did it. We broke up so fast after it happened and I don't speak to him at school or when he comes to our house so I just don't know he did or what he was thinking."
30,"I mean you make it sound like I come home from work, kick my feet up on the coffee table and say ""Where's my beer, woman?!""

The first thing I do when I come home is feed the baby...sweet potatoes that I puree myself, mainly. Then I give her a bath, get her in her PJs, read her a bed time story and hand her off to my wife who breastfeeds her. Then we take turns getting up every couple of hours with her. Admittedly, she gets up with her more since she breastfeeds...but at 5:30-6am I get up with her, change her, dress her, play with her, feed her for 2-3 hours while my wife sleeps.

Every. Day. This is a 24 hour day job for me too...the only difference is I have the additional pressure of maintaining a full-time job and dealing with all that shit to boot."
31,"I've read of enough divorces were the payment for the children's college education was part of the divorce settlement that I no longer think that that is rare. Especially if a dedicated college fund was built up during the marriage.  
Do you know if this was discussed between your parents during the divorce? Or if such a fund existed?  

Apart from any such legal obligations, he simply does not have to pay for it and is probably no longer feeling bound by any promises to your mom. It's shitty, yeah. But it simply is."
32,"Or it may peak their interest.. IDK, but when I first read this I found their motives seems a bit suspect for the double bed booking. Boundaries people!"
33,Leave pokemon out of this &lt;3 
34,I too want to be an edgy artist doing nothing all day and being supported by others!
35,"Hello, just saw your edit

Please don't take Ativan and drink.  That's a dangerous combination. "
36,"I think this is edging into emotionally cheating territory. If I were your gf, I'd be very upset. Namely this:

 * She and I have spent most nights talking and texting. Her fiance thinks she is seeing someone (namely me) and she told him a few days ago she doesn't love him anymore. She had to stop texting me from home.for 2 weeks because she promised him 2 weeks to let him try and rekindle.

If she has to cut you out to work on her relationship, then you two are being inappropriate. Does your gf know all of this stuff?"
37,This!!! If he wants to be separated he takes his kids! They are his responsibility. Don't let him take advantage of you like that. You need to work on your issues and put yourself first. Do not let him pawn the kids off on you and use you as a babysitter!
38,"Significant others don't fall under the window of ""plus ones,"" though. Traditionally, plus ones are only extended to truly single guests. Significant others should be invited. Plus ones are 100% optional. "
39,"What's crazy is that this kid is obviously under so much stress from his step brothers not respecting his space in an alien environment. He's a 15 year old kid who doesn't know how else to say ""stop messing with my things"" for them to listen. 

This kid obviously needs to be disciplined for the property damage, but the bigger issue is how the father lets the step sons walk all over his child. "
40,[removed]
41,"Yeah, no. Part of being a responsible parent (or even a halfway decent babysitter) is not letting them play around broken shit. It's really not hard at all to tell a kid, ""I'm sorry, but that window is broken. Do you want to look out this other window?!? I bet there's some cool stuff out there! Let's play ""I spy"" out Nana's not busted window!"" "
42,"&gt;you can stay close to your siblings while they're at uni, which is kind of nice. 


nice? Hmm. Not for all tastes, that."
43,"It sounds like she has been unwell for the whole relationship. Also someone unwell means you are understanding, it doesn't mean staying in a parasitic relationship."
44,"  Ya'll are young, like *really* young.  I'm 43 and last year I had a cancer scare, it was a lot for my wife (that I've known for 25 years) and I to handle.   
 He may come around, he may just run from the pain and regret it later, it's a fuck of a thing to deal with, and you opting for euthnasia might feel like you're leaving him."
45,"Why can't she come as a friend of the bride? There's no reason why any of his crappy family need to know that you're together, i spend time with my female friends at weddings without anyone assuming we're gay and going to hell. "
46,"Yeah, I don't get the ""doesn't count as a fever except for technically."" Dude, it's a fever. Period."
47,[deleted]
48,"Hey lady, it looks like everyone else has covered the dumping.

I'll address your future career. Since he's a local police officer (worse that he's in a leadership position) you're going to have to do some work to get away from him. Look at moving at least a county or two away to start applying for jobs. Have you done academy yet? It might be best to go to school far away too. It sucks, but public service careers are entirely a game of who knows who.

And of course never date someone you might know professionally again. "
49,"Sigh, *thank the stars above* that I'm not alone in thinking she's batshit insane. I'm glad the consensus here is that I should tell her to grow the fuck up because I have been dying to do that for a while now. There are probably still some things that I don't understand about I the demisexual...lifestyle, but as far as I understand it, if there's nothing about being demisexual that 80% of us don't already experience in our own relationships to some degree, can it still be called a sexuality? 


The rest of my friends see her as a very delicate and fragile person, but I honestly think she's been pulling the wool over our eyes. I do hope confronting her doesn't fracture the group dynamic, but I can't imagine I'd be saying anything that wasn't on the rest of our minds. "
50,"Four things to distinguish:

1. Politeness. (This dinner is delicious).  This is communicating gratitude. 

2. White lies (I can't come to your party because I had a prior commitment).  This is about not hurting feelings.

3. Holding counsel (-not saying anything when you describe your patio plans-).  This is about not presuming you know best what someone else prefers - i.e. respect.

4. Actual lies (I didnt fuck your dad).  Self-explanatory.

You are assuming 1-3 impact someone's honesty, and they dont.  You are fixating on the ""lie"" word in a fashion that some autistic people do - assuming anything other than blunt, inconsiderate and disrespectful brain dumping is somehow morally suspect in some way.

You are missing that 3/4+ of communication is not contained in the direct literal meaning of what you say, but the inferences.  

Examples:

- This dinner was delicious - by inference I am grateful for your effort and appreciate your invitation.

- I can't come to your party because I had a prior commitment - by inference I like you and value you as a friend.  

- -not saying anything when you describe your patio plans- - by inference I respect your ability to plan a construction project, to choose an appropriate design according to your own tastes and to carry it out to completion.

The alternatives are horrible:

- This dinner was too salty, and the texture was off - by inference I don't appreciate you and judge you to be a shit cook.

- I dont want to come to your party - by inference I don't like you or value you as a friend.

- -criticizing and overruling your patio plans- by inference I dont trust your judgement or competence and think I know better than you.


Serious question, are you on the autism spectrum as this nuance is particularly tricky for them?"
51,I made this throwaway for this thread. I have exactly the same problem and i struggle with it. I just hope more people will see this thread and help us with some suggestions..
52,I can't believe you haven't even asked him about it....?? This sounds like the plot of a cheesy lifetime movie. 
53,"Not OP, but this advice really hit home. I don't get ""obsessive"" in dating, but it has been easy for me to get wrapped up in a new person after I've been out of the dating game for a few years (ended a 3 year relationship about 8 months ago). Points 2 and 4 are especially helpful for me. Thank you for this!"
54,But it could be a money thing. 
55,"If that's a hard dealbreaker for you, then it is what it is. Might be worth saying it to him: I'm not living here forever. If that means this is the end, so be it, but I want you to know I wasn't making that up or exaggerating. "
56,A trifling ex-wife indeed.
57,"I know you don't want to dictate who your BF hangs out with, but really, your BF is the biggest problem here.  He can have whatever friends he wants, but what kind of BF lets his friend talk over, ignore, and lecture his GF and ""shoo"" her out of the house in a strange area?  What kind of BF makes no effort to understand why his GF is upset about everything going on in the world right now?  What kind of BF says he doesn't want his GF to avoid someone who's been shitty to her?  What is any of that about?  It sounds like your BF has a huge blind spot when it comes to this friend.  The way I'd feel about this/what I'd say is, ""BF, if you want to be friends with this guy, go ahead, but leave me out of it.  I'm never going to hang out with him, and if I see him at the wedding, I'll be polite and say hi and then go talk to someone else.  I don't like him, he's been a jerk to me, and I'm never going to be comfortable around him.  You are totally free to spend time with him without me.""  If your BF can't handle the two of you not being all buddy buddy, then maybe y'all aren't compatible."
58,"What do you think she meant by be careful? Do you think she was saying it because that's what mothers say or do you think she was actually saying be careful, something bad can happen so don't do it again."
59,"&gt;I'm just going to say that as a neutral third party who you really have no reason to lie to, I don't totally believe you either judging from your story  
  
Exactly what I was thinking. Why does she sound like she's begging for forgiveness from us? Lol.  
  
OP is either a nervous wreck because she can't handle conflict at all, and needs to work on her ability to remain calm and communicate effectively, OR she is hiding something.  
  
Either way, her abismal handling of these situations and blatant acts of distrustful behavior is more than enough to justify her bf's reaction.  
  
The desperation in this post sounds so panicked and guilty. If she really had innocent intentions with the bumble app and with the ex, she shouldn't be this frantic.  
  
If you're really being honest OP, talk with your bf about couples counselling. You need to be better at communicating honestly and openly.  
  
It's so fishy though, I really doubt your intentions were pure with bumble and with your ex.
"
60,"girl.

get out of there!!!!

there's a reason a 30something doctor would want to marry a girl 10 years younger than him (and from a lower social class, if i'm reading this right). "
61,"I was going to say ""...or you could just propose to him?"" but it sounds like your relationship is going down the toilet, so maybe just break up, unless you want to clean up after him for another 50-60 years."
62,"This is a rather classic problem with your family division of labor. Both you and your husband have difficult, exhausting jobs and (understandably) want to be appreciated for doing them. In your husband's case, he apparently wants that appreciation to come in the form of you not asking any more of him than what he already does, and in your case, you want that appreciation to come in the form of respect and understanding that although your contribution is not financial it is nonetheless very real. Your fight happened because you both got exactly the opposite of what you want from the other. You asked him for more (in his mind, saying you wish he was home more got translated into ""she wants MORE from me????""), and he suggested that your contribution is worthless. Ouch and double ouch.

Trust me when I tell you that this dynamic (though common) can get quite destructive if you both dig in your heels. You might try to talk it out with him, find out if you are each able to start seeing things from the other's perspective. If you get stuck, though, I suggest you invest in a few sessions with a couples counselor. (I am married to a psychologist and this would be a fairly easy thing for him to work with, provided that your relationship is otherwise sound.)

"
63,"It sucks that Luvox didn't help you--I've had OCD for most of my life and Luvox took my symptoms down about 80%. I have a friend with OCD who didn't have much luck with it though. What dosage were you on? I didn't see my biggest improvements until I went past 300 mg a day. My psychiatrist said he will prescribe up to 400 for OCD!

You might want to look into Dialectic Behavioral Therapy (DBT) as well... you mentioned you've done some mindfulness and CBT. CBT helped me for anxiety but not as much for OCD. Have you tried any kind of anxiety meds? Ativan also did wonders for me. I've been almost suicidal before over my OCD but now I hardly feel like I can say I have it anymore. It's such a nonissue now but it plagued me/consumed my days for 20+ years of my life. A lot of my overcoming my issues had to do with dealing with the trauma I'd experienced in my past as well as learning tons and tons of coping skills and decreasing my stress in every possible way while upping my life enjoyment in the small things. Eventually, 6 years of therapy + meds and a ton of self-improvement snowballed, I guess. I say all that to say I do believe it's possible to get to a place where OCD does not control your life, and to encourage you to keep fighting to be healthy and happy and sane.

Also, if you aren't already doing this, I'd suggest making sure you're doing a LOT of self-care. For whatever reason, this massively helps me whenever I get into a bad spiral."
64,"&gt; Out of my college friends, Chad is definitely one of my closest. We talk a few times a week, and our friendship is very important to me.

That's a lot of conversations to have. I understand there's no ""easy"" way for them to meet, but you might consider doing things that aren't just ""easy"" when it comes to what you say are important people like your best friend and your boyfriend. Like I said, most people would be eager for their best friend and boyfriend to meet, talk and know each other."

66,The point is to be casual and not put him on the spot
67,"It's as simple as that. OP sounds like a great person who would stick through tough moments to keep a relationship afloat. This guy does not seem like he would do the same. Depression can be something nasty, but it doesn't give you the excuse to lie, ""cheat"", and the other things he's doing. 

OP, dump him, and meet someone worth fighting for. What ever this guy used to be has basically destroyed that person by the actions he's doing now. "
68,I think most people can discern a difference between a relative and a friend you've fucked.

74,"I mean, she says it's the exact amount. I get the impression OP is from the UK or similar, where they have large value coins.

She is lying to you. 

There is literally zero possibility you could be the father of a child she is testing positive for today, if you only had sex with her a week ago.  Biology makes this impossible."
80,"In fact, let’s summarise what actually went on:

* You met her and were attracted to her
* You tried to talk to her about family but she didn’t engage
* You helped her learn to snowboard
* You spent a day with her over Xmas vacation (but you also did the same with the previous, elderly nanny, and presumably didn’t snog her)
* She tried her best to establish boundaries by calling you “kid”
* You asked for her number and she gave it to you (if I was a nanny for a family I would also want family member’s numbers, in case of emergency)
* You guys texted (wow)
* You watched a film
* You kissed her because she “didn’t say no”

It seems like any tension/interest was coming from you. There is nothing here that suggests she was into you. Also, you should do some research on what counts as consent if you think not saying no = saying yes."
81,"This reminds of a saying that I was taught as a child:  ""Bad associations spoil good habits.""

I've taken that to mean that sometimes you can't afford to get too involved with people who engage in lifestyle choices that are diametrically opposed to your own.

My guess is, by associating with this couple, your wife has gotten comfortable with their views and lifestyle.  The more normalized those views become to her, the easier it is to act on them.

I believe that if you want keep your relationship monogamous, you'll need to cut this couple loose."
82,"&gt; I am not interested in dating her

What does this mean in your case?  You are *heavily* involved with her already if she comes over every single night, even if she doesn't stay the night.  You have feelings for her, too, or you wouldn't be worried if she's okay.

Are you sleeping with anyone else?  Would it be a problem to agree not to?  "

86,"Normally deleting texts is shady as hell behavior, but you're paranoid and seem like you violate her privacy and harass her about her motives, so I understand why she'd do this.

Honestly, you sound like the problem,  not her."
87,"It is a bit of an odd gift... does he get her similar things for her birthday/christmas?

If he's a millionaire then it mitigates the weirdness, but not entirely. I agree with others saying that 600$ to him might be 6$ to you, but it's still a bit odd to spend so much money on someone regardless, unless it's a THING that this guy likes to spoil his friends with expensive presents/share the wealth. 

I'd probably talk to your GF about it and if she says, yeah that's how he is, he got so and so a trip to mexico for his birthday last year etc etc then I guess that makes it a bit more normal.   "
88,"&gt; he is not a predator.  

Forgive me if I say that you have no way of knowing that. 

If he is intelligent enough to graduate from college and become a teacher, he probably isn't an idiot. 

Consider the possibility that you are in denial that your boyfriend is a person who could be a predator. The denial is a very common, human reaction. 

From out here in Internetland, his behavior screams grooming, and I'll bet my house and car that the school, the school board, CPS, other teachers, and parents would see it my way. 

If you still don't believe me, please x-post to /r/Teachers, see what reaction you get, and show him the thread. "
89,"&gt; I think the real problem here is that you need to make new/more friends.

It's *a* problem, but I'd say her penchant for lying, gossiping, and being a questionable friend might be a bigger issue."
90,"Yep, OP is actually correct to be concerned. This is sounding a lot like something out of the troubled teen industry, which is pretty nightmarish. Anyone who hasn't heard of it, google it. We're talking making kids go on 10 mile long day marches through the desert in the summer without shoes or water ""therapy."" A lot of times the counselors have no actual psychiatric or therapy training, some of them really don't like kids, some of them like kids a little TOO much and see troubled teens in an isolated environment as an easy way to take advantage. Some of them will take away a kids necessary psychiatric medication by flushing them down the toilet, considering them drugs, then think the kid is acting out when they become unresponsive from withdrawals. They use antagonistic group therapy sessions invented by discredited cults like Synanon.

And if there is any mention of a ""kidnapping"" involved in this program that OP stumbled on, it's more likely than not a bad troubled teen therapy camp. I've also heard of the cases where those ""kidnappings"" go wrong - where the guys drug the kid in order to shut them up and make it so the kid can't tell anyone what happened and no one believes them because ""clearly the kid is on drugs"" even if the kid wasn't to begin with.

Parents get worried and paranoid that oh no, little Jimmy might be on drugs, and these predators are ready to swoop in, charge thousands of dollars for a couple months of ""rehab/therapy"", and the poor kid ends up in real therapy the rest of their lives to get over what happened to them there."
91,Other coworkers of your husband tell you about their conversations? How do they go about this-just chit chat or do they seem concerned?
92,"The fact that you are realizing this instead of doubling down into denial and defensiveness is actually kind of refreshing. Definitely get your ""adulting"" situation worked out before getting into a serious relationship. If you decide that this is a cultural norm you want to keep, you may need to accept that the cultural norm of going for an arranged marriage with a woman who fully understands you've never had to care for yourself and possibly never will / is okay with that might also be a necessity. "
93,"&gt;He will send me pictures of rings I like and talk about a wedding, but when we have a serious conversation about it he says we aren't ready.

This is cruel. He's got to stop toying with your emotions like this.

It honestly sounds like he isn't sure what he wants in life and seems to stuck a bit in neutral. I don't think you should give him an ultimatum like ""propose or I'm gone,"" but definitely one like ""talk real with me or I'm gone."" 

Sit down and have a serious come to jesus chat about what your future is together, why is *really* delaying moving in, why is he sending you pictures of rings and saying he's not ready, etc. etc. Give full, honest communication one more shot, and if you don't hear what you need to, it may be time to move on for your own sake."

96,Probably a bust. It would be a deal breaker for me. Don't drink so much next time!
97,"this is an excellent response, because it is a reaction to the actual problem. Your friend isn't ""disappointed that your family isn't homophobic"", he's just racist. "
98,"I'm about the same age as your daughter and my bio father pulled a similar stunt except he was a bit older than you and my mom stayed single. I found my father as an adult and honestly, I don't think it was good for either of us. I don't need a father. He has no real room in his life for me. There's no teaching me to ride a bike, or intimidate boyfriends etc. Just a guy who banged my mom and walked. It's an awkward fact to base a relationship on.

If you want closure, get it in therapy or get it from your ex. "
99,"This is just sad. That you have these preconceived notions about what makes for 'normal' sex is sad. Not your fault, it's what porn tells you, what the world tells you, so of course you pick up on that stuff and believe it. This idea that a vibrator is somehow more natural or normal or acceptable than her grinding her clit against something is bonkers. Is it more important to you that you be the one to 'perform the stimulations' than it is that your girlfriend enjoys sex with you? It shouldn't be. She likes to grind her clit against things, it really shouldn't be hard to find ways to incorporate that into sex. Even penetrative sex. Like ForMahPops says, try her on her stomach with something under her to grind on, maybe even reach under with your hand. Leave your hand still, let her work it against herself, because if you're trying to hit the right spot- you won't - because the ""right spot"" moves.  

Ugh. It's just so frustrating the ways people dismiss and deny and pathologize the ways women get sexual pleasure. As if women are broken."
100,"Honestly she sounds like an immature unpleasant person lacking in empathy.  Stop trying to persuade her and move on with your life without her.

You, on the other hand, desperately need professional help.  And before you start with the ""I cant afford it"" crap, you cant afford NOT to.  There are loads of therapists who do sliding scale fees (so cheap) and even some charities that will do therapy for free.  If you are in education your school can hook you up too."
101,"Because, hormones.


I once broken into an hour heart crushing sob fest because... drumroll... I couldn't open a jar of pickles. 

Hormones are stupid. "
102,"If she wants an abortion, you should be doing everything in your power to make sure it happens. Or would you rather be paying child support for 18 years?"
103,"Out of anger at her, it was his way of telling her to get out of his face."
104,"He's a mid-20s male. Of course he's going to hang out with the person who he's going to be having sex with more than the person he won't be.

Snark aside, it's sort of unfortunate that that's the way it tends to go. Especially at the beginning of budding relationships, those relationships tend to consume the time of the people in them.

One of two things is going to happen, and you can't really choose or even strongly influence which: either he'll find a balance, or this will be the new normal.

You could try talking to him about how you never seem to hang out as much any more, but... that's probably not likely to influence him much."
105,"Dude... Like I said in my previous post.  Grow a spine,  get a DNA test,  if the baby is yours lawyer up,  and then move on. "
106,"I first thought he was joking, because what kind of hypocritical d-bag would say something like this, so I laughed. That just set him off on a tangent of how I am selfish, never think about him and how I 'shouldn't get to shirk on my responsibilities to go on a mid week laze-about-on the beach booze up'. 

Why on earth would he unload this on you-sounds like either h doesn't have much respect for you or he has issues that you aren't aware of.

 I lost it and called him out on all of his bullshit, how I have been a fucking adult for the past month and dealing with everything on his behalf for the past month while he gets to gallivant on the other side of the world. I was, and am still so furious that I hung up on him.

Good for you.

have been ignoring all of his calls and messages.

What do the messages say?

When you are ready you can send him a very term message quoting  some of the things he called you and ask him to elaborate on his beliefs regarding your character.  See what he says."

109,This can happen to anybody doctor or nurse they check for patency before administering any drug. I know this doesn't help your anxiety but the good thing it was caught by her. Folks that get chemo injections tend to have brittle venous structure and eventually may require a special port for chemo administration.
110,"I'm sorry OP, but we're going to be on the side of your spouse here.  He's not doing anything wrong. You're the one with shame issues, and asking him to hide who he is.  He shouldn't have to pretend to be someone else around your family, when there's nothing wrong with who he is, and supposedly that's the person you fell in love with and decided to marry.  If your family has a problem with that, you should be supporting HIM and telling them to get over it.

If you want to save your marriage, tell him you're a complete idiot, you're still dealing with internalized homophobia, and promise to get some counselling, and that you don't want him to change or think he should pretend to be anyone else in front of your family.

If your family can't deal with this person you love because of THEIR homophobia, then maybe you should cancel the trip."
111,"That really sucks, and those guys are so rude. I'm sorry you went through that. They definitely weren't making themselves look good to your roommate by being so rude to you either!"
112,"&gt;  He can be very forgetful though, so there's a high probability that he just forgot the document was there.

Somehow I doubt this... even forgetful people don't leave something that could potentially blow up their marriage and family lying around...

&gt;I do have friends outside of him

That's good. I'd also say you should try to get an appt with your own therapist ASAP on the books. "
113,Sounds like youre furious because she might actually be in love. Maybe its taken her this long to find someone who makes her come off less cold. You didnt even make the age gap the reason for you to be mad. Just that she is having sex with someone in general. 
114,"You aren't compatible. He doesn't have the same life goals and ideals you have. And he also doesn't want you to have yours. Most people in happy relationships encourage each other to be happy and healthy and pursue what makes them feel those things. He shames you for prioritizing your fitness over time spent with him. He could encourage you, but he doesn't. 

Why did you start seeing a 30 year old man at 19? "
115,"This is a good point, and honestly the most likely reason now that I think about it."
116,"Why are you protecting your abuser? Abusers get away with abuse because people don't talk about it. Even if you're not angry with your mom for her actions, your sister has every right to be.

It sounds like you AND your mother are in denial. At 17 she's old enough to have a baby and run away to join a cult with an abusive man. She's old enough to know that people did this to someone she loves (i.e., you)."
117,OP buried the lede massively. They adopted Missy's kids after she would beat them. So yeah OP is pretty pathetic 
118,"I'm 40 and I fucking love it. I have confidence, money and a bit of wisdom. It's rad."
119,"Continue saying no. Explain that as roommates, rent is not split by income. You pay for what you get, and you're each getting shared use of your apartment and utilities. That's why it's equal.

Also, look for somewhere else to live after your lease is up. These guys sound ridiculous."
120,"Don't go on a second date. Not because it's a red flag (it might be pink), but because you don't want to. Never date someone you don't want to date.  

In the future, in that situation, say ""separately"", pay for yourself, get your change back, and don't make it a thing. And just keep paying for yourself rather than merely ""offering"" and leaving it up to someone else.  "
121,"I am undergoing EMDR for sexual abuse trauma. It's very difficult-- the most important thing for EMDR patients is having the best aftercare and strong coping skills. OP's sister is not a good candidate right now for it, but if she reaches some stability in the future, she absolutely should. It has been life-changing."
122,This is a really fucking terrible idea.
123,"Doesn't matter what your friends think, as long as you're cool with it."
124,"OP, stop being a creep. Try pursuing people who aren't taken. This might be the reason why you're almost 40 and still clueless about social interactions."
125,MAn you gotta set a no facebook policy when tripping. 
126,"&gt; You mixed things up.

Oh yeah? I merely linked to and quoted your own post. Your response is pretty telling."
127,"Honestly? No one in this house sounds mature enough to live with roommates. 

It's John's house. He bought it. He should never have agreed to it being a ""party house"". And the fact that ""everyone agreed"" means nothing. 

I realize you have deep cleaned and contributed. But it's always bugged me when someone notices something that needs doing and asks if ""someone can do it"". 

You may pay rent but John is clearly feeling overwhelmed...and seems unstable. 

You could organize chores, you could sit down as a house and agree not to argue and to each choose 2-3 things that you cannot deal with, i.e. ""Boxes in the fridge"" etc. If communication doesn't work, move. "
128,"&gt; Yes, my behavior with Lily is all above-board. I've been very clear about that. I don't save our Snapchats, so I can't show my girlfriend. But she should trust me anyway.

People tend to keep score more by what we *do* than what we *say*. 

Imagine her perspective for a minute. You're exchanging messages and/or pictures with a woman, sometimes *during your dates* with your girlfriend. There's no record of these exchanges if you don't want there to be, nothing to show if you're being ""above-board"" or not. You're insisting that you're not doing anything wrong, but you're also not saving any of these exchanges to show her. You're literally insisting that she take your word for it, and offering nothing else to support it. "
129,"First- him judging you for dating someone else- big red flag!

Also, him reacting like that- does that character have any overly bad sides to him? It may be a case of him projecting his faults somewhere else.

131,"That. . .would be a problem for me.  He can't be that oblivious to what it looks like when his own damn coworkers are telling him so.  That actually makes it worse; it's not just his wife, but the people at his job, who aren't half as close to him, who can see what this woman is doing.  "
132,"Unless there is some misunderstanding going on here, she is being absolutely ridiculous... what is her reasoning behind you having to wait for her?? ""Boyfriend, you had to wait for me to come back to go to that specific restaurant because ...."" 


The one and only explanation I can think of is that she wanted to show the restaurant off to your family and get some daughter-in-law points. Maybe she had already worked the whole thing out in her mind. "
133,Well he has a family. Tough titty. You don't get to be away from home 3 weeks out of the month when you're raising children. If he was posting on here I would tell him to get over himself.
134,[deleted]
135,"Maybe ""doesn't get a say"" is overstated- good parents should maybe get to say something, but they shouldn't get to give or withhold *permission*.   If I was the parent I would chew the OP out first and foremost for assuming my daughter doesn't have agency to decide for herself.  "
136,"Hell, no, you do not put your name on the lease with your abusive ex boyfriend, You and your sister move out and get your own place.  Where is your sense of self preservation that you are willing to put up with crap like that but are concerned about your sister *seeing* it?  And until you can get out, learn to dial 911.  He's physically, verbally and financially abusive. Get him out of your life."
137,... This guy doesn't know finances and is guaranteed to put a damper on any relationship and *especially* a marriage.  
138,"Why have you posted this again? You posted this yesterday and barely even tweaked things. Though you did change the ages a little. 

It pretty clear from the three posts I've seen you make, including the one little over a half an hour ago about his ""double life"" that you do not trust your SO at all. So why are you still in a relationship with him. "
139,"Definitely this. Getting blackout drunk at a professional event is easily the quickest way to make a bad name for yourself in that profession. OP said she was concerned about being the youngest one there, well she certainly proved it with her behaviour. "
140,"Um your girlfriend doesn't get to ""keep the peace"" with her Jew-hating family who consistently try to leech you for money. 

That's not how relationships work. Her responsibility is to ensure her family behaves in a way that is civil and appropriate. They're doing neither. 

Call her on it. You're not asking her to choose; but she is to shut that behavior down immediately, or accept that you simply won't spend time with her family any more (super bad for any long-term relationship goals).  "
141,"&gt;he honestly was just paralyzed until his brain processed the event 

Well, you just summed up how I felt. This is the reason for the 2 seconds. I was just stunned by this. When I came to my senses, I immediately pulled away."
142,"Why bother bringing it up? Do you really want to make the effort of convincing your boyfriend that you are a valuable and interesting person? 

Don't waste your time on this guy. There are so many men out there you could be dating who wouldn't make you jump through weird hoops to prove that you're ""deep enough"" for them. Frankly, he sounds like he never matured past his teenage years."
143,"Well, good. Up until now I believed you were completely in denial. Unfortunately, reading the rest of your posts leaves me to believe that your ability to delude yourself is fully intact. 

Do you honestly believe that this is just a minor issue with no consequences?

As an aside, how do you feel about your husbands apparent willingness to take the blame for himself?"
144,"We lived together for a little while until recently when he got an apartment closer to his new job and the area we were planning on moving to. I am staying in the house until the lease is up and he stays here on the weekends. He is on call a lot for work and it is closer for him. His dad lives right down the street and is handicapped, so he is also caring for him. 

He has a key to my place, but he only has one key to his apartment."
145,yeah it's like a running joke. Harem of Asian women with THE one white dude. It's a sad attempt to laugh at a seemingly creepy situation. 
146,He sounds like a pretentious ass.

148,"Well she definitely lied and so did the roommate. I guess they could both be lying about a whole lot more too! Maybe you should look for further evidence before you confront about this. She could easily deflect by saying it was before you got together - a lie is a lie though, and if she could lie about that, then she could be lying about other things between herself and the roommate.

Are you 10 years younger than her or was that a typo btw?"
149,"Honestly it sounds like you are doing all the right things already. 

Also: You didn't trick him deliberately, your upbringing tricked you into never considering who you might actually be. "
150,"It is glaringly evident in most of the huge age gap posts that the younger of the two in the relationship has very serious issues that require therapy to get past.  Sadly, they very rarely recognize it.  Sure, the older of the two has issues as well, but it's much less likely they would seek and/or benefit from therapy anyway (or want to change).  I'm speaking as a middle-aged person here, not an early 20-something. "
151,[removed]
152,"Yeah, no. 

This is a power play by the ex and she fell right into his hands. At this point I dont think it matters what their intentions are- I'd have a hard time taking a relationship seriously with someone who thought this is reasonable. 

I'll add that you need to learn to go with your gut. I think you are getting good input here that reinforces you initial feelings. Don't apologize in relationships for being reasonable. Your apology here was not because you were wrong (and I bet you don't even feel you are wrong), but out of fear of losing her. That's a shitty place to be. "
153,"Inconsequential or minor mistakes in your eyes can be large in their eyes. After 6 months you should be lessening those, and unfortunately, the reality is that you're going to have hard line bosses. 

Realize that it's toward an end goal and you're earning money to spend on your life outside of work. Few people actually wholeheartedly love their job, or at the least every single aspect about it. You can try approaching your 2 rotation physicians or the RN next time and ask if there's anything they feel you could do better, but you really unfortunately just need to suck it up. "
154,Quite possibly they were hoping you'd notice and correct your behavior.
155,"If you are saving it for your wedding night with the expectation that it will be some magical wonderful moment, you will probably be disappointed. Losing your virginity can can consist of pain, him not being able to get it up, him lasting for 15 seconds, or some combination of those, plus additional things. IMO, it's not worth it just to get some huge built up expectations at the risk of not being sexually compatible. Sex is something you will be doing the rest of your life with this person, wouldn't you want to give it a test run before agreeing to that? "
156,"&gt; She has the life a 19-year-old woman could only dream of already. If I were to quit, she would lose everything. We'd have to sell our huge house, beautiful cars, clothes, and I'd go into debt.

If she's living the dream, why the hell is she so unhappy? You just THINK she's living the dream because you don't understand what a woman needs. I don't know where you picked up this framework for a relationship (parents? TV?) but it's seriously flawed!

You need to do some serious soul searching because you can't have it all, despite what you currently believe. We all have 24 hours in a day and must decide what is most valuable to spend that precious time on. You've already cast your vote but don't want to make the sacrifice you're actually already in the process of making. Wake up.

I want you to be honest with yourself about where your priorities are and what you ACTUALLY love. You're in love with your work. Accept it. You sound like a full-fledged workaholic who tosses a few crumbs to his lady between work and sleep.

Please get this into your head: she doesn't need a big house, expensive clothes, whatever else material thing YOU think she needs. She's TELLING you what she needs and you're just not listening because you're so stuck up on what YOU think. Stop thinking for her. She loves you so much and is trying so hard to express that. I really feel for her.

You've got to find a way to balance the things you want in life. If you seriously cannot trim down your work load, you need to either let her go so she can be happy again OR keep going the way you have and deal with the affairs. It's one or the other - you choose."
157,"Well probably not ""eat like shit"", but I'd definitely say he hasn't exactly thought through that she won't be able to keep up with his meals and energy output with their sex difference and particularly his over a FOOT in height on her "

174,"Why?  Because you're afraid it'll get Darryl in trouble?  Darryl should be in trouble, if he thinks reopening a problem that had actually been resolved to your satisfaction and creating a whole new one in the process is the right way to handle interpersonal office conflicts.  Because you're afraid it'll damage your relationship with your boss?  If he's going to let the fact he likes and trusts Darryl on a personal level get in the way of what's best for the team, that's information you need to have, especially before you make a decision based on your loyalty to him that's not necessarily the best decision for you.  Or are you just afraid Darryl's going to complain to the whole office?  Then you can just say you went to your supervisor with a problem you'd tried to resolve on your own, and are disappointed it didn't end there.

What are your hard no's and what can you realistically compromise on?  Even in polyamory there are rules, and you need to do some research and consider what rules you won't break. Then date until you find the women who are in sync with what you are looking for. 
"
192,"So your planning on marrying her but didn't so much as bother to tell her when making a big life decision, even knowing that your GF doesn't want to live there. The fact that you didn't even want to know her feelings on the matter before making the decision (the person you apparently love and value and want to build a life with) is a huge red flag. Clearly you do not value her opinions or feelings so what about her do you value so much?
You made it clear that this is YOUR future, not hers, and YOU can do whatever you want with YOUR life - she has no place in your life or future to the point where you literally did not even think about her when making this big decision. 

It's not about asking for her blessing, it's about communicating. And even if it was - you wouldn't want your future wife's blessing on this? Huh. Hope she takes this as a wake up call."
193,"Doing something, even something not racist, just to get a reaction out of you is a really shitty thing to do. Continuing to do it after you requested that he stop doing it is even worse. You don't have to lighten up about something like this. He needs to grow up. I would consider it a deal breaker."
194,"&gt; I suggest you look up ""cognitive behavioral therapy"".

This, so much this. Look for a psychologist (not just a ""therapist"") because this type of professional is literally trained to teach you and use techniques that can gradually change your behavior. Behaviorism study just that - you won't go there to ""talk random things about your life"". This isn't how a session with a psychologist works."
195,"you can't please everyone. you can't believe everyone else's assessment of you. you have to treat yourself better, you deserve it. start by finding a good therapist, someone you trust and feel comfortable with. "
196,"Well, maybe you should both communicate strategies then, because what if she quits before you? Like maybe you should have a plan to quit on the same day and whoever doesn't have a job yet will have a back up plan."

199,"Sometimes you need perspective. Sometimes the perspective you need is from a member of the opposite sex. The problem isn't having the conversation with the people outside the relationship. It's when you make changes based on that information without coming back to your so. 

We all have problems we need to talk about with other people sometimes. This extremely insular view people have on this sub is often baffling. "
200,"I'd also point out that homelessness, lack of social support, isolation and family dysfunction are all risk factors present in human trafficking victims.

201,"He basically said the cat was unwelcome, though, and had a laundry list of reasons. "
202,"Disagreements aside, you did bring up something important.

&gt;I guess because I am sure I want this. He isn't.

He is showing he isn't ready to make the jump to engagement yet. There could be a myriad of reasons for this that many of which are entirely out of your control (like arbitrary time goals). The why doesn't matter so much as what you do next. You can't force him to be ready, but you don't have to wait around either. I understand logistically this sucks but if you keep forcing the issue there's a decent chance he'll make a decision and you won't like it."
203,"I am not doing wrong. Sex worker, prostitute. Just a title, one has more negative connotations. I am not bothered by either.

I am not corrupting my heart as I do not have any love connection to my clients, but have an extreme amount of love in my personal life. I am not corrupting my body as I always engage in safe sex. I am not corrupting my mind as escorting does not challenge my morality in the slightest.

I am not essentially a drug dealer. I don't deal drugs, I sell sex. It really is quite different.

I don't offer love or partnership because that is not the service I am selling. I do offer companionship, friendship, conversation, cuddles and intimacy. I offer intelligence and humour. I offer a solution to overcome previous sexual issues. I offer a way for clients to feel confident sexually, when they may not in their personal life.

 I don't think you, someone who has never met me, is able to determine whether or not my job is ""good for me.""

I do not receive a fundamentally small amount of money either. I receive enough money so I can afford to live debt free, continue to pay university fees, save to travel the world, and help my family with their finances. But please, if you believe this is fundamentally small, feel free to assist me in paying these costs.

I'm pretty sure I am still a person even though I have sex for money sweetheart x"

210,"I have OCD (diagnosed ten or so years ago); one of the tools my therapist has given is, when the obsessive thoughts start, interrupt them with a distraction - either a walk, run, reading, video games, etc. There are other things I do of course, but focusing energy/thought on something else (and giving permission to yourself to try five minutes, and then you can have the thoughts again, try ten minutes, twenty, etc) is usually what it takes for me to get past that cycle.

Of course there are other tools. But refocusing on games or playing a sport or some kind of crafting activity is a tool in and of itself."
211,Yeah.
212,"People are allowed to have whatever deal-breakers they want, you're allowed to have 'no hunting' as yours and he's allowed to have 'tries to tell me not to hunt' as his. But this seems like it's about more than the actual potential hunting. 

It strikes me as odd that he would mention it in passing as a thing he will 'probably partake in' in the future. This situation as you describe it gives me the impression, and maybe I'm wrong, that it's like he was purposely mentioning this thing he knows you wouldn't like just so he could show you that he'll do what he wants whether you like it or not and you can't stop him. 

It would be one thing if he had a history of hunting and had quit but missed it and mentioned he was thinking about starting again, ya know? I'm having difficulty figuring on what it is that makes him have a ""guaranteed interest"" in the first place. Did he offer any specifics about what makes him interested in it? Was it about cooking what he kills? About being with his pals in the wild? About helping to control animal populations? About an interest in using certain weaponry? About the thrill of being stealthy? Just some creepy joy of killing living things? If he has a specific reason for interest then maybe he's being genuine, but if he can't offer any reason for the interest in it I'd feel like he's testing you to see how malleable you are, to see if you're willing to compromise on your deeply held beliefs for him. 

I think it's for the best that you broke up anyway, considering you're so young, your differing priorities, and how big the age gap is. "

216,"No, of course not. That's ridiculous.

But that's not what is happening here. OP's wife isn't weighing anything, she's caught between two men telling her what to do. She's not asking for advice, she's asking to be taken care of, and since she's already chosen her dad to do that, it's not worth it for the OP to fight her on that, or to try to compete."

218,"I'm so sorry for this situation. She may have even been fighting this feeling for longer, who knows.

220,"You're not the one that's going to be judged. He will. Trust me, success and good looks don't mean shit. I'm in an industry filled with these types of people, success doesn't mean shit when he's beating a woman. All success and good looks mean is they will judge him much harder than some regular schmuck. The higher up, the harder the fall, and you can bet your ass there are people secretly wanting to take his spot. 

Why would anyone judge a woman strong enough to leave a guy like this? They would be admiring you and wanting to help you. The only way they would judge you is if you stay. 

Think about this, this guy has an anger issue and is getting physical with you. Who in the blue hell would like someone like that? I can bet you they'll be judging him even if they don't say shit, trust me I've seen it. "
221,Emotional dependency isn't cute.
222,"So, a lot of this is speculation since I don't know any of these people or you, but from what you've described, I wonder if your boyfriend isn't also saying negative things about you to either his ex-roommate or the girlfriend, which they then talk among themselves believing it to be true.  It's one thing to not like someone but still be friendly to their face--that's normal and it's just something we have to do in social settings.  But, if he's done the two-face act to the girlfriend to the point where he seemed obsessed about how terrible a person she is when he's not even the one in the relationship with her, I wouldn't really be surprised if he felt compelled to do the same to you.  I wonder if he either is crushing on the girlfriend...  Or, if he is jealous of the time ex-roommate is spending with the girlfriend instead of with him, and is now behaving like he has the hots for ex-roommate and is trying to isolate the two of them away from other women.

In either case, he's acting shady, and they're acting shady.  It does sound like there is some gossip about you going around.  If it's fake gossip--someone is spreading malicious lies about you--I think you would do best to ditch them.  You can try salvaging it, but it sounds like you weren't really close to or even liked these people anyway so it's not much of a loss to just leave.  If it's your boyfriend starting the lies--regardless of the reason, definitely leave.  A relationship is hardly salvageable if one party is going around *slandering* the other.

If your boyfriend is spreading truthful but negative things about you... well, I'd suggest reconsidering the relationship anyway because he should be addressing such issues directly with you, or in confidence with just one person... not an entire social group."
223,"Honey, you need to move back home and apply for Medicaid and financial assistance through your county.  I have no idea how you think you and 2 babies are going to survive while your bf is playing on his PS4.  If your dr or hospital call social services on you, you are going to have bigger issues than a cruise your bf wants to go on, like your children ending up in foster care.  "
224,"Right.  You think that marrying into a rich family means your money problems are over, actually they get much worse.  Marrying a rich girl means you have someone who is used to having everything handed to them and expects you to do the same."
225,"Big fucking difference between 17 &amp; 20 vs 16 &amp; 22, as well as between 50 years ago and now."
226,"Hi.  I am sorry for what you are going through.  I would like to suggest that you stop caring what other 'people' think and focus on what YOU think.   You do deserve an explanation.  That said, you cannot force him to talk to you and give you that explanation.  Take care of yourself.  Do what you need to protect yourself.   "
227,"Have you thought about careers that will actually enhance your ability when the time comes (example: careers in child development, teaching, careers that help with home improvement skills, domestic skills, etc.)?  Could you go to school instead of work and study something relevant to being a wife and mother, work for a few years after that, and then become a stay at home mom? Even if you can't work in this country legally, can you look into nannying or babysitting jobs and take a few classes on child psychology and development? 

Your boyfriend has said that as a prerequisite for marrying him you need to improve your self esteem and not lean on him so heavily.  If your dream is to marry him it looks like you're going to have to figure out how to do that. If your dream is just to get married and have children with any man that will want you, then maybe it does make sense to move on. But most healthy partners aren't going to want to be with someone who has low self-esteem and who is co-dependent.  At your age you should be able to support yourself regardless of what your future may hold.

Having a career won't get in the way of starting a family if you pursue a career that won't get in the way of starting a family.  Plenty of careers or jobs will actually help with raising a family.  It sounds like what you're really saying is that you just want to be taken care of rather than become an autonomous adult. Very few healthy people would want to rush into marriage with someone who feels that way.  

If your goal is actually to start a family what are you doing right now with your life, aside from dating your boyfriend, that will aide in that goal?  

It's a fine goal, but if it is what you want you need to work towards it.  First you need to be a healthy partner (which includes addressing the self-esteem piece and the overly dependent piece), then you should be saving now (while you don't have children and can work) so that you can afford to stay home in the future and still pay for things as needed), and finally you should be developing skills that will help you with your life goals.

I know of a few women and even a few men who always knew they wanted to be stay at home parents and they chose their early careers accordingly (one was a doula for example, another became a marriage and family therapist, and a third became a contractor and after marriage was able to repair most things in the home). If you bring nothing to the table in terms of savings, skills, or interests that is a problem. "

232,"Well it might be a good thing that you're not raging angry.. that will allow you to think more clearly.  It does no good visualizing what they did together or anything like that.

My [37M] advice would be divorce her.  It's a no-brainer imo, especially with the kids involved.  The kids won't be better off in a 2-parent household going forward if there's resentment between you 2 (and there definitely will be, even if you're not that angry now)."
233,"No but don't do the opposite, argue your advice with you and ask questions about why the other person told them what they told them.

How is he supposed to know? It doesn'take a lot of common sense to realize her husbands not a mind-reader of her dad and it insults his intelligence.

I get just as annoyed when family bothers me about technical crap that i dont even feel like helping them with, then ask me why whatever happened at best buy when they bought the opposite of what i researched them needing and instead assuming the sales guy has their best interests at heart.

It's insulting."
234,"&gt; Even difficult babies start sleeping through the night by 5-6 months.

100% not true. Some children don't start sleeping 'til the night until age 3 (my daughter was 2 before she ever slept through, she's 3 now and still wakes up in the night occasionally). 

As for the little speech you wrote for OP - absolutely not what he should do. If his wife has PPD that'd be a devastating thing to say to her - in fact, even if she doesn't have PPD it'd be a terrible idea to say something like that. This part is the most ludicrous:

&gt; After that I'm taking over and you need to let go of the reins. 2 weeks is what I'm willing to do. At the end of the two weeks, if baby wakes up more than once per night, then I'm taking over or I'm going to start sleeping somewhere else 

I know she's a SAHM and he works long hours, but he's the baby's parent too and he doesn't just get to bail because it's difficult. This part of your comment is also based on your incorrect assertion that ""even difficult babies sleep through the night by 5-6 months"" - it's NORMAL for babies of OP's child's age to wake during the night more than once. Saying to her he'll fuck off somewhere else if she can't change that is ridiculous."
235,It's over. There is no recovering from reading in black and white that you were never loved and he never even felt attracted to you. And he also lied about a class he was failing and had an emotional affair? Have some dignity. You don't deserve this. Nobody does. 
236,No one is saying the girl wants to marry you. Just that she might of seen your boner and been like....😏. Cause she's human. 
237,"This is good. She did use it, though, by telling the second guy he's one of many -- sounds like it didn't work :( "
238,"I think it's very reasonable of you to demand that he stop donating sperm. This is a huge betrayal and for him to act otherwise is either willfully ignorant, insensitive or moronic - and if you lay it on him how much this hurts on so many levels and he still refuses to consider stopping, I would demand counseling or a break. 

You also need to talk seriously about what kind of invlovement with the kids is expected or allowed here. Very rarely are sperm donors involved in the lives of their children at all. He almost certainly won't be a ""father"" to these children and may not even be allowed to interact with them. He will also likely be giving up any parental rights and will not have to pay child support. To give you an idea, my stepsister and her wife sought a sperm donor to have their daughter, and they refuse to even talk about his existence or identity with myself or other family. If someone refers to him as the child's ""father"" they consider it very offensive - THEY are her parents because they wanted her and they are raising her, the sperm donor was only a facilitator for that. That is more than likely the kind of situation you will be in - but you need to have a frank conversation about the mother's expectations and your husband's. "

First of all, I don't understand why an ex congratulating her ex on his marriage is instantly block worthy. Maybe she was just being polite. I sent my ex and his girlfriend an engagement gift and some presents for their new baby; I still am very fond of him, but there are zero feelings of love or attraction for him anymore. It's just something nice you do for someone who was a good friend and important in your life.

Besides it costing much, MUCH time, it'll probably also cost a _lot_ of money. I joined a sorority which was like ~300$ per month, but some others had to pay up to more than ~1000$ a month. Why invest that + lots of time into something you're not even interested in? Also not fair, if you were to join, to the other people that join.


Tell them that or say something like, ""Imagine a guy that isn't even remotely interested in dogs, but people around him keep pressuring him into getting an expensive dog. Finally, he caves in and gets that dog. But, he still isn't interested at all in the dog and gives it no attention and it costs him a lot of money and time, while he couldn't care less about the dog. Is that fair to both the man and dog? Not at all."""

254,"I think there is a mixture of your anxiety and insecurity talking here and a red flag of a not-so-Healthy person. 

Many of the things you've mentioned such as face symmetry and level of sharing are normal in a friendship. We see our own flaws so much more clearly than our friends do because they love us, sometimes more than we love ourselves.

However, the fact that your friend doesn't respect or celebrate your sexual orientation and wants you to change is a red flag. I would not be friends with someone who didn't love all integral parts of me. 


The fact that she is trying to force her religion on You despite your disinterest is also not awesome. Your boundaries should be respected by your friends. 

I don't think your friend necessarily sees you as a project but definitely doesn't respect or accept you as she should. "

260,"Dude. You gave him nine years. He isn't entitled to the benefit of your support as a friend when he's treating you very unlike a friend would treat someone they cared about. 

You also won't be able to move on as long as your heart is pinned to his happiness. Additionally, such a one sided relationship will torpedo any good, viable romantic relationships you try to pursue while propping him up.

261,"She sounds completely honest. I've read all your replies. I have no idea where your doubt is coming from apart from your own deep insecurities?

262,"&gt; ""Yeah, I smoke again; deal with it.""

There's your answer.  He does not genuinely want to quit for his own sake - and without that personal investment, it's not going to work even if he does put in the effort.  Which he pretty clearly doesn't want to do.  Besides...

&gt; Am not considering breaking up with him

I thought you said this was a dealbreaker?  Why should he take you seriously that this is a big problem for you when you just keep adjusting your expectations every time he moves the goalposts?  If this is a big enough deal to end the relationship over, you need to act accordingly: tell him he's out of chances, and walk away.  If it's not, then you need to come to terms with the fact you're dating a smoker and plan your future with him/any kids you might have with that in mind."

Just because people post this on the internet doesn't make it true or pertinent to your situation.  I'm sure that most people would not have a problem with their SO being friendly to an ex.  Friendly as in running into someone in public, exchanging a few pleasantries and continuing on.  But not many wives are going to stand pat why their husband is talking, texting, meeting up for drinks multiple times a week with their ex.  If he values her friendship that much, tell him to pack and bags and move in with her."

It doesn't matter to me the make up of our Thanksgiving table 10 years down the road, whether she has a husband or wife.  What matters is that she's still in charge of baking the pies, and that whoever she's with treats her with love and respect. "

268,"this was my thought too. let her implode on her own. 

Also, OP, you may want to bring this up to Ann - if she recommends Jane for the promotion, then when Jane inevitably melts down in training, it will reflect poorly on Ann. They may decide to scrub Jane's promotion and promote you - which will cost the company money, reflecting even more poorly on Ann. 

I mean, don't phrase it like that, but maybe tell Ann you're concerned that Jane's anxiety problems will prevent her from performing well in training, and if that were to happen, you're there to be her replacement. That might put the bug in her ear without you coming across as manipulative. "

And I am sure he would still have loved you the same if he knew that you are not genetically his. 
When it comes to your siblings, they are still genetically your siblings. I understand that you feel like you only half belong to them anymore, but that's just not true. You are their sister by blood *and* by bond! 
How old are your siblings? Maybe you could tell them, but it really depends on their age and maturity level. Only you can make this decision, because none of us know them. 
When it comes to your mom, I think what she did was unforgivable. You never need to forgive her for that. Give yourself time, and don't put too much pressure on yourself to forgive her. I think it may be best to contact her less for some time, or even not at all. 

Lastly, I think you would really benefit from talking this through with a neutral third party, like a therapist. You are not only grieving your dad, you are also going through a lot of uncertainty and confusion right now (as would every other person in this situation). You need to find your sense of identity again. 

I wish you the best OP. If you want to talk, I'm here. "
277,"Look, no one here can help you. This goes beyond the ""2nd date and I'm panicking"" sh*t you usually read on reddit. You need professional help now. Getting intoxicated when you're mentally ill and on meds is NUTS. Especially if you have a child. And what seems to be an irresponsible a**hole boyfriend. 

You say you love your child and yet you do this, what the hell is wrong with you?? I'm sorry if I'm being harsh I feel for you I really do, you seem to have had a tough life but this behaviour is unacceptable. 

I know you probably want empathy or sth now but tbh the first thing I thought when reading your post was that somebody has to take your son away from you for a while. You were willing to kill yourself over a movie, what if you hurt or killed your son during one of your episodes? Get help please. Just reading this made me fear for the safety of you and your child."
278,"I agree with everyone else. It is unfair that you benefit from her choice to buy a house but she does not benefit from your choice to save money and put it in account. I think she is calling it 'our' fortune to make a point, as you have probably been calling it 'our' house. "
279,"I guess there are some things we ask that aren't really questions. I think choosing to hang out with friends when it means ditching your girlfriend so she has to go home hungry and alone is a bad choice. I agree that there's some implied choice there, but I'm surprised that there was no suggestion made from either of them about other options. It was only get towed and be hours late for dinner or get towed and just don't go."
280,Didn't you post earlier about this guy not giving you civil partnership so you can stay in the country? Yes it is abuse. Every post told you to leave. You should leave but there is a barrier stopping you. Please figure it out and get out 
281,"I think it's justifiable. I know it's easier said than done, but there really isn't a reason to worry! :) "
282,I agree. The OP could have asked wife to stay home and rest while he went to the wedding by himself. 
283,"I think if you have skepticism about being monagamous or monagomy in general you are better off finding a partner who has similar views. IMO it's not fair to get into a relationship with someone of opposing views because you can eventually for what ever reason i.e. when the other urge comes on say ""well I did tell you I was not sure about being in a monagamous relationship so you should understand"" You seem to want to do some cake eating here which IMO would be taking advantage of someone who definitely is soley interested in monogamy."

285,"Yeah 5 months isn't that long compared to a lifetime... I mean, we have all been in bad spots before but he was crossing a lot of inappropriate boundaries and his whole situation with his new gf... 

Lost love can be a bittersweet thing but it can also be a dark, twisted thing that is clung to in desperation. I think this is more of the latter

Yeah, just try to get away from this guy as far as possible. It's only risking harm to you and himself"
286,"Also, do you trust him if your relationship hits another rocky point? That's where the trust would really need to come in."
287,"Never date a guy who calls you a slut, or uses the word to describe other women."
288,"Agreed. He sounds cringy as fuck and deluded as to what society and ""normal"" people expect and value. 

None of that strikes me as particularly autistic in the way OP describes it... It just sounds like he's cultivated a persona that is annoying and super lame."
289,"Honestly, you sound insufferable. Your sister and all her stuff with her boyfriend? The puzzle? That is A JOKE. 

You are 32 and drinking so much you are hungover when you know you have to wake up early and drive 300 miles? Umm...who is the rude brat in this story? I think it was your pounding head making her seem insufferable, or you have zero powers of self reflection. "
290,"&gt; But even though he does it without hesitation I'm scared to ask him because the next time we have the smallest disagreement he says I'm lazy or that I'm worthless and white trash like my family and that I'd never find another man as good as he is and that i have to deal because I couldn't provide for our son like he can.

You don't have a communication problem, you have a ""I married an asshole"" problem.  

Hire yourself a helper to help you with the baby so you don't have to ask him for help.

"
291,I feel like a lot of people came hard for OP just because her husband works and she stays at home. Like his time is so much more valuable than hers. 
292,"Sooooo, you don't even have visitation?  Wow."
293,"A ray of hope, OP! He is still young enough to change but you are going to have to have a difficult conversation(s) with your gf and set very clear expectations before you even consider blending your families. You don't say whether you've talked about this before, maybe you have. It seems concerning that she may view this as normal behavior. 

In any case, if you do decide to move forward, you need to have many conversations about discipline strategies, house rules and the like. I assume there are other parents involved as well (your ex and hers), so communicating and coparenting with the exes, etc.

Good luck."

295,"You're right. Stick with ""nobody gives a mouse's patootie."""
296,"As a person who's love language is rooted in touch, I totally empathize with him. Throw in having a fiancée that feels unattractive and works 12hr days and I'm searching your history for hints that you're her. (Nothing there.)

If he's anything like me, he'll want to have sex with you often. He'll want to hold you and be touched by you often. And not getting that will leave him feeling unloved and unwanted. At first he'll do things like working harder at cleaning or working out, trying to take stress off of you and get your attention/attraction, because how could he *not* feel like a rejection is personal? If it goes on long enough, then he'll stop trying those methods and come to a cross roads. If there's no sex for a couple of months he'll have to decide if he wants to continue to put up with this sexless relationship, or if he wants a sexually healthy relationship. 

Once a week isn't bad, but it has to be more than a quicky. Someone who needs touch to feel loved wants the whole experience. 

Now I understand that you're working on yourself, and you're doing the things that you need to do to cope and work through all the shit that you have on your plate, just don't let your relationship die because of it. There are things that you have to do to keep it alive and one of those things is figuring out your own sexuality. "
297,"&gt; Yes this is ~~a little weird~~ wildly incorrect.

FTFY.

"
298,"&gt;  and if she inquires about where you first did this,

I feel like this is a perfectly acceptable time to tell her a little-baby-lie.  Saying, ""Oh, I loved when my ex did it,"" is unnecessary and just not cool."
299,"I dated someone once who told me that I would just hold him back and ""stunted his personal development"" - he would send me links to super conservative YouTube videos and get frustrated with me when I wouldn't reciprocate or if I commented on any inaccuracies. 

Meanwhile, I have a successful career, my own place, and fulfilling hobbies and friendships - and he's currently jobless and living with his uncle. 

You didn't post a ton on your current situation, but I'd be willing to bet money that no matter what you do, it's not going to be enough.  And someone who would term this kind of situation as the ""last straw"" isn't really worth hanging around for. "
300,"Don't try to play detective yourself.  Tell the cops you think there's additional reason to suspect your ex, and let them make sure they take whatever legal measures they need to take to collect the evidence.  You don't want the sample thrown out in court because his lawyer claims you tricked him or contaminated it somehow."
301,"You are impatient for income. So is everyone else.

Gearing up for a pregnancy and gearing up for a career move are mutually incompatible.

So choose: baby making now or 5 years from now. Which do you want more?

ETA: Discrimination is reality. Laws are nothing without enforcement, so unless you are willing to pony up tens of thousands of dollars and years in attorneys fees and legal battles (and no,  it is NOT common to find an attorney that will work for free until maybe a pay out is had years down the road), her rights mean diddly squat. If her life is merely made hell, and she is not fired, I doubt you would have a case worth taking-- she doesnt make enough for the payout to be worthwhile for the attorney even if the case is rock solid.

Plus, you will then be living with a traumatized, hormonal pregnant woman who is even worse at stress management. Nothing about this is worthwhile.

You are better advised to ask her to take a second job nannying. It is temporary, doesn't effect her resume, and is in line with gearing up for kids."
302,Not to mention increased stress like this can really hinder chances of conceiving. 
303,[deleted]
304,"Girl, I've been there. I dated a guy who thought that porn was the be all and end all of sex. If he is already getting grumpy at you for not being his sex toy, it will not get better. It's 100% okay to show you things he would like to try. It is 100% not okay for him to get upset with you for not wanting a sex act to be a part of your sex life every time. Consenting to something once is not consenting every time, and if he is unable to respect that then you aren't sexually compatible. "
305,"Move the fuck on.  

You had one date and got along. That doesn't oblige her to marry you. It doesn't oblige her to ""give it a try"" with you. She has absolutely zero obligation to you.  
She knows what she's looking for. You're not it. She has the right to whatever criteria she wants. Stop moaning over this and go on a date with someone else.  

When you see her, be polite. If you can pull your head out of your ass, you might be compatible friends, and if that's not what *you* are looking for, you can at least be friendly acquaintances. "

307,"You can ask for a roommate transfer, and setup a camera in your room. Depending on your state you can likely set up one in your common area as well, but that's a variable."
308,"I appreciate your response, but I abseloutly was not snooping. I wasn't looking or suspecting. I was cleaning out a closet which I told him I was going to clean out the night before. So he knew I was going to be in there. The first page is a letter made out to ME, was I seriously not going to read that?? I don't feel like I have to apologize for finding something that he left out in the open.

I don't plan to confront him, I'm not angry right now. Just really sad. Obviously he didn't intend for me to see it or he would have given it to me by now. I don't think he feels the same way when he wrote this or he wouldn't still be here. I will talk to him about it."
309,"I think the answer is that it bothers him all of a sudden because he's now changing *his* diet to not include meat. Either the meat smell is making him hungry because he can't have it anymore (the same way people trying to quit smoking try to avoid smelling cigarette smoke), or it's making him ""nauseous"" because his morals are offended by people eating meat. I don't think there's much of an argument that he's allergic, or that there's some medical reason for his aversion.

Either way, he punished the entire group for his convenience, and is feeling the effects of being disliked because of his actions."
310,The fuck is this shit? You're confident the husband has someone on the side too? what a generalization. 
311,"You sit her down and you *firmly* and *unequivocally* BREAK UP WITH HER.

No JADEing.  No ""I'm sorry,"" either.  **Anything other than ""This relationship no longer works for me.  I am breaking up with you.  I will be blocking you and do not want any more contact with you.  I wish you all the best moving forward,""** won't be taken seriously.

She'll want to know *whhhhhhhhhyyyyyyyyyy.*  DO NOT GO THERE.  Whatever you say she will vow to change.  Whatever you say, she will treat it as the opening round of a negotiation.  Honestly, this woman is so needy that I'm not sure she wouldn't hand her kid off to relatives if you claimed that you didn't want to date a single mother.

This woman is deeply, DEEPLY troubled.  Be prepared for suicide threats, if not outright attempts.  Be prepared for at least a light case of stalking--she may turn up outside your home or office begging for another chance.  Dear god, I wonder if she'll drag her daughter into this?

Do not worry about hurting her feelings:  **her feelings are not rational and can't be spoken to.**  There is no magic way to word ""I'm done here; it's me, not you"" that isn't going to stoke what I'll guess is a deep fear of abandonment.

The kindest thing you can do here is to end it.  You don't have to do it in person, in fact I would counsel against it:  are you really going to remain strong when she falls apart in front of you?  Or will you agree to keep limping along out of guilt?  Yeah.  Break up with her over the phone.

And maybe install some security cameras.  You know, just in case she gets *really* crazy."
312,"&gt;  I know he loves me

No, no he doesn't.  This isn't how you treat someone you love.  

&gt; ...and tries...

No, no he doesn't.  In any case, ""trying"" doesn't count for shit:  all that counts is DOING.

&gt;  he will be the man I know he has the potential of being,

***YOU NEVER EVER DATE A MAN FOR HIS POTENTIAL.***  That ""potential?""  That's *you* projecting your hopes and desires onto *him.*  That's YOU trying to mold him into the man of your dreams.

Your bf may be awful and a parasite, but he is an autonomous human being who exists separately from your plans for him.  He clearly has no interest in being The Man You Want Him to Be--*as is his right.*

You date a person as-is.  You date them on the assumption that what you see is what you get, with any possible change completely and utterly dependent on the person deciding that they would like to change.

That's it.  You are not god.  Do you love and desire this man *as he is now?*  Do you see a future with a man who steals and lies and refuses to work or in any way work with you as a team?  Because I'm thinking that this is where *your* thinking is all wrong:  you believe that relationships are hard work, don't you?  And that as the good, loving woman, you should be willing to do all this hard work on your own, a single ox pulling a cart meant for the combined strength of two.  While he lounges in the cart and tells you that you're moving too slow.

Ladies of the Internet:  *The Giving Tree* does not model a healthy relationship!

&gt; I'm tired of hoping he will be the man he told me he was

We've already established that this man is a liar.  And manipulative.  If you find the strength to leave him--AND YOU SHOULD--be prepared for tears and protestations that he'll change, oh, how he will change!  He will be the changiest man you've ever known!  And he may even mean it...until the panic wears off and he inevitably tries to play you for a sucker.  Again.

Just leave.  He never was the man you thought he was.  You were always dating a construct, a dream, a hope.  And that is no way to go through life, trusting a chimera.



"
313,"Yeah, so you were definitely in the right here. Your sister is way too old to being doing shit like that out of spite. She shared your personal, secretive writing with her friends just because you two had a disagreement. Not only is that childish, it's fucked up. She violated your trust because she didn't want to clean after herself. Until she apologizes, you shouldn't talk to her or let her anywhere near you. "
314,"It's rude to stare, I believe our parents taught us that one pretty early on. 

It's not ok to be a creep just because the other party isn't aware. Would you defend a guy with binoculars peering into the class? By your logic, that's completely harmless. It's disgusting behavior, and not difficult to control oneself."
315,"Don't date someone if you're embarrassed to be with her.  She deserves someone who's proud to be with her.  

If you're ashamed of being seen with the type of women you're attracted to, you should be getting help/therapy to come to terms with your issues before burdening women with the insecurities that lead to your embarrassment."
316,"This. Proportinal is the most fair in my opinion, and we have not had a single issue with it"
317,I feel like if her insecurity is the true reason she'd cut her sister out of her wedding there has to have been huge red flags up before this point. 
318,"Hi - Big Sister here, oldest of 5 with 3 sisters and a brother.  I'm 36, their ages run from 25 to 34.  I definitely was the first one around for my parents to figure out their parenting style and they've softened with age and as more of my siblings grew up, so I can see what you're saying.  All of my sisters are beautiful, they look like they belong on the pages of a magazine.  With my siblings that are 8-11 years younger than me (like OP) I've always thought of them more as a cross between my siblings and my kids, it's different from a regular sibling, it's a maternal feeling that I have for them because I knew them as babies and small children and was much older.  I babysat them all the time, changed diapers, read books to them, etc..  This is why I cannot understand where OP's fiance is coming from at all.  How could you be so hurtful  to your sister by not inviting her to your wedding - and because you're afraid she will look prettier than you???  That's just really mean and incredibly childish and shallow.  Sisters are for life and if she doesn't include her sister in the wedding celebrations, that is something she will regret for life and might possibly put a thorn in their relationship that they may not recover from.  "
319,Wtf has Benji done to be thrown out?
320,"&gt; I started crying, he comforted me for a few minutes and then proceeded to climb on top of me. I just let him.

This is one of the most depressing things I've seen on this subreddit.  And I say this as a cat lover (and owner of two) after a day of cat abuse!

Also, jokes aside, I've been in your shoes.  This guy is shit for you.  Leave him.  He is trying to manipulate you into sexual acts.  Fuck him in all ways that aren't literal (I mean fucking leave this asshole)."
321,Plus it's a 2 against 1 situation. The soon could easily feel like he has no place in the new family.
322,"I'm definitely going to transfer my savings out of our shared account.  We did talk today and will see how him getting into therapy goes.  My ""get help or we're not going to be together"" scared him, he said he didn't realize we were at that point.  We'll see."
323,"&gt;I've never had an one night stand, evem though I could have, but I did want to respect myself, my body and my potential future partner.

Having one night stands doesn't mean you don't have any respect for yourself. What it comes down to is that how many people she has had sex with doesn't define her as a person. Stop shaming her for having had these experiences, it doesn't devalue her and it shouldn't taint your image of her. If you want to get over it, you need to critically think about your feelings concerning this."
324,[deleted]
325,You gotta explain to him that it's not about a comparison between how much you love the cat and how much you love him. Obviously loving a pet and a human is like apples and oranges. What the real issue is with his little hypothetical ultimatum is that he's trying to take away things you love for no reason. It's manipulative and controlling and immature and ten other red flags. THAT'S why he would lose if he gave the ultimatum.
326,"&gt;He claims that since he stopped, he forgot about it over time, and recently remembered and started to scan his brain for other details he didn't want to keep hidden. He says this is why he didn't share everything upon initially telling me... it took him time to mentally revisit the scene.

This... is not the way memories work? OPs bf is making this sound like him being unfaithful was some traumatic experience he blocked out or something?"
327,"I agree that the dad's opinion doesn't matter and it's not OP's role to provide a great life for his wife (since they're partners), but dad does have a very good point about having more than $300k in debt that his partner doesn't know about. That's a lot of money and can impact their shared finances - it's good food for thought."
328,"Tell your parents you are tired of being the only kid getting yelled at. At this rate, if it takes you impregnating someone to get a reprieve, you will consider it. "
329,"I think you really need to apologise to your mom. She seems like she takes your opinion very seriously, and she might be thinking about postponing marriage talks with him for you, and she shouldn't. All of the issues you brought up are either not valid (if you were trying to marry someone after a year and a half it would be too soon, for a woman in her 50's it's reasonable), or more about you (you don't have to know him the same way she does. You and your brother are adults, it's not like he's going to be your new dad) than her.



Seriously you need to apologise and force yourself to get into it a bit for your mom. It will take effort and you may want to see a therapist to discuss your feelings, but you should be getting excited with her. I actually feel really bad for her, she was probably expecting some excitement, happiness for her and maybe some interest in the wedding, but you made it about you."
330,"Hmmm, good points. I appreciate your sharing them.  


I was reading it like the dad didn't know how to tell his son he was going away, so he just pretended that he wasn't. But, you're right - it is lying, and it is traumatizing his own son, so it's more serious. 


Thanks!"
331,"And if OP really wants to piss her off, you can go and start playing D&amp;D with your friends! Then you can PRETEND to be the wizard she despises so much"
332,What is keeping you two together?
333,"I definitely agree that she was way out of line, but you keep saying that ""family comes first"" and it's the ""family's duty"" but whether anyone likes it or not, she IS a part of the family now. I think it's kind of rude to say that one persons celebratory news is more important because ""they're family"" when the SIL is a part of the family, too. 

Yes, OP's SIL is a brat and needs to get over herself, but maybe she doesn't feel very welcome because the families are so different. Who knows. "
334,Nope. He usually sides with guys. Kindof re thinking a lot of things now.
335,"Holy crap I never thought of that, but I can ABSOLUTELY see that happening "
336,You realize that's actually a thing right? anti depressants actually do have a big affect on your libido and could easily the be reason she's not interested in sex or being sexual.
337,"OP, don't be left alone with her ever again. If she needs to stop by your place to pick up some stuff, make sure you have a friend with you and maybe even tell her you'll record the exchange because you are concerned for your safety."
338,Sure and it seems like they have a decent relationship. But she still needs an outlet to talk about healthy adult relationships without having to worry about hurting her dad's feelings.
339,Maybe the daughter wants her mom to know. I'd ask your daughter op. 
340,"I think ""I have to be married with kids by 28"" is arbitrary and vague, but I think ""I'm definitely not going to be ready to settle down until I'm 30+"" is basically the mirror image of that sort of declaration. It's just as arbitrary and vague. "
341,"Unless you plan on living to 112, this is more like 1/3 life crisis, if you're lucky."
342,"Him not listening to reason is the most insane part.

Ranting here, but one of our ""literally every week"" arguments is about my bank deposit.  Facts are: We do a fair amount of cash sales during the day.  My schedule is broken up, where I come in at 4 am to get the early morning baking done.  I leave after the morning rush, then come back at six to talk to customers, but leave an hour before close.  The bank is about a ten minute drive from the shop.

So, I've gotten in the habit of taking the deposit to the bank during my middle of day break.  It also gives me a chance to get change if we are low on small bills.

My dad thinks that I should either take the deposit before I get to work in the morning, or after close.  Neither makes much sense.  If I take it before open, I would have to pick up the deposit first, then drive to the bank, then come back to the store.  This would add twenty minutes to an already early morning. 

For me to take the deposit in the evening means I'd have to stay until close, which I don't want to do because I have to be up for 4 am.  If an employee goes to night deposit, they would have to be paid for their time, plus its an insurance risk.  And, if we need change, we have to make another run anyway!

But most of all, this is a totally inconsequential argument.  The deposit is taken daily.  There's no issue.

Yet week after week, he will see me leaving for the bank and stop me.  ""I guess we have to have this conversation AGAIN because you keep having this problem.""

Arrrrgh!

347,"Yeah, I get that all those reactions sound over the top in hindsight, but this situation could easily have turned out differently. I'm happy she's cool and everything, but that doesn't diminish the severity. I could have seriously hurt her. And I definitely didn't just hop around in pain. I hit her with my elbow. That shit hurts.

356,"You need to stop monitoring her water intake. You don't know if it is why she fainted. Some people don't drink that much water and are totally fine. In fact, I think they're scrapping the ""8 cups of water a day"" guideline thing, because it is too generic. 

Have fun with your girlfriend. If you're at the gym or outside and it looks like she's getting dehydrated, you could remind her to drink, but don't turn it into an interrogation of how much she drank that day. She is an adult and can manage that herself. "
357,Great point thanks!!
358,"Turn it off and keep it off. There's no reason to spoof GPS even if it was an option, that's just as ridiculous as her insistence that she needs to track you. Be a mature adult and simply stay firm and calmly explain your position.

362,"Thank you, I think that's what this is going to come down to. I'm probably going to tell him to start taking this seriously and realize he has to take care of himself, or he'll have to take care of himself and all the complications associated without me around. "
363,"I know I have. Sub-drop happens when you don't receive the aftercare you need.. I didn't read up on anything to do with that because in my mind I was thinking, ""Well, I wanted that... so why do I feel like this?"" And I felt so confused and lost and just depressed for about a week and a half. Then I made a post on r/sex and my eyes were opened and thankfully I've never had to experience sub-drop again. "
364,"It is, but it's surprisingly neglected. It's not unusual for vanilla people to try something a bit unusual like bondage/dirty talk which is very insult-heavy/anal and not look into or consider that sexual play can have real effects. The fact that your partner agreed to be told she's a dirty slut and a whore doesn't mean that she won't appreciate confirmation that that's not actually how you think of her. 

There is a severe lack of education in the basic care elements that come alongside most non-vanilla sexual behaviour, which I suspect is how you end up with certain situations where someone is outright abusing their partner (e.g. by forcing boundaries, ignoring safewords, using humiliating behaviour outside of the bedroom where it wasn't agreed upon) under the guise of being sexually dominant."

He seems super fragile and I'd be hesitant to be so straight to the point about something as big as that, especially since he seems like he's on the verge of a breakdown.

Whose toothbrush was it?

You acknowledge it's a girl friend's fantasy. It is physically intimate in a way. She publicly broadcasted having privileged access to something private with you, even if it's unusual. It's understandable why she'd feel jealousy.

Frame it another way... would you allow a guy friend to brush your teeth and post a video of it? Is there any more hesitation with that? Is there any small piece of you that feels that'd be grosser, or less acceptable? If so, that'd expose there's a sexual component.

What if your girl friend's fantasy was being a giant, and she had you crouch down small as she recorded a video of stomping you with her enormous foot? Would you go along with that? What if you knew she'd masturbate later watching the video?

This is weird so it's less obvious where the lines are, but I don't think your girlfriend should be instantly dismissed as being unreasonable. There might be something to her perspective."

Goverments limit density for reasons:

- health. Higher density leads to the spread of disease. If there are 20 people sharing one toilet, there is guaranteed to be cases of one occupant defecating somewhere other than the toilet. The toilet is guaranteed to back up. The result is  feces on the floor which leads to hideous disease.

Classy move, OP's BF. 

Are there any other topics that cause friction? Now that the idea of moving into your own apartment is a very real thing, how does he handle that kind of discussion? Is he under the impression this kind of shit flies when y'all live together in your own place (Fun Fact: It doesn't)?"
389,"My boyfriend did a few pretty insensitive things when we first started dating. Things that, at the time, I wasn't sure I would forgive. But he always apologised, we strengthened our communication, he learned what behaviour I find upsetting (which is not the same behaviour as his previous girlfriends), and the insensitive things are now few and far between. Now, I consider him the love of my life. 

&gt;  I was pretty upset that he would leave me to ride with a tow truck guy alone

&gt; He never asked if I got home alright.

Some guys, despite being understanding and sensitive, still don't get how frightening it is to do these things alone as a woman. It just honestly doesn't occur to them, until after the fact. 

If your Ewan is anything like my boyfriend, he wouldn't have had an issue with the situation had the roles been reversed (had he stayed with the car) and it didn't occur to him that you would be upset. Now he's cottoned on, and the promising thing is, he knows why you're upset. 

You're allowed to be hurt. But I personally wouldn't consider this a deal-breaker. "
390,"Yeah I had those. Also oatmeal, metamucil, coffee...

It's vegetables and fruit that I really need. If all you eat is processed food, especially cheese and the like, your bowels aren't going to move anything after birth."

396,"I purposefully left my sister out of my wedding.  She is an absolute jerk to me at all times and I have no contact with her.  Our wedding was about celebrating the love between myself and my husband, I did not want to worry about how she was going to ruin the day.  "

Oh, well. Good luck, but I doubt he'll stop recording/sharing conversations as long as his girlfriend's around. "
399,"&gt;But that does not mean there is a serious problem. It does not mean your relationship is at risk. In the real world, love is messy. All that really matters is that she's there with you. 

You can't really be sure with either of these statements though. 

I was in OP's position before and she ended up cheating on me with and leaving me for the other guy several months later. Honestly if I were in that position again I would run for the hills. 

So saying all that matters is that she's with him...doesn't mean much. It's possible that this is harmless but as it stands it's a pretty big red flag.

403,"I still don't consider them family. I refer to her as ""Dad's wife"" and them as her children. They will never be my family. If that makes me petty, so be it. 

In my defence, I've hated her since I was a baby, as she's always been around. She was a friend of the family since before I was born and my Dad started dating her when I was 13. I told him at the time, date anybody but her. I understand that he has a right to be happy, and this was told to me by many family members during our fight, but his happiness does not outweigh mine. 

I know plenty of blended families that work well but mine is not one of them. I hate when I speak to my Dad, and instead of saying her name, or ""my wife"" he insists on referring to her as ""your stepmother"". Seriously vomit inducing. Sometimes I hang up when he goes on too long about her.

But if your SO had a friend who hated you, never wanted to meet you, constantly talked shit about you, wanted her to come over 2 hours whenever she was sad and your SO bitched at you about not being understanding, how other exes didn't care about certain behavior you express discomfort with and thinks you're overreacting/calls you annoying and says you're qqing for no reason, like you can't say you'd just smile and go ""k honey whatevs""?"

So, that's called ""lying."" Which is not a GENUINE apology, it's just empty words you don't actually mean.

What you're saying is, ""I want to be able to say words I don't mean and have that erase the consequences for my actions."" Tough shit, that's not how it works. Your mom doesn't believe your lies, that's why she isn't accepting your fake apology."

Using that line ""[Sister] cannot enjoy her evening if she's defacto in charge of enabling Frank to look healthy and sane for the wedding and reception. She deserves a night to relax too,"" may be exactly what the Aunt and Uncle need to hear. "

411,Counseling would probably help. This seems like a ridiculous problem to bring to a counselor. I don't think he loves me less but I have no idea why suddenly he wants me to change. This isn't a recent conversation so I'm not sure I've asked the question that exact way. I'll try it.
412,Dance? Western secular or Indian cultural? I would figure traditional communities are more conservative. And how much of a community participate will you remain?

If he is willing to see his mistake and sincerely apologise, I see how things could work out. It's easy to get wrapped up in selfishness and miss the bigger picture sometimes. If he's not willing to listen to reason though, I'm really not sure what to tell you..

416,"Or maybe he was a real mess in highschool and now that he's a functional adult, she's interested. 

That doesn't make her a gold digger. I think the OP decided no one wanted his awesome self back then because he had no money, but hasn't stopped to think that there were other attitudes and behaviors he was exhibiting that were a turn off.

Coming to the party as a groomed, self sustaining adult made her interested. Yet he assumes it's just a money thing. Then he reminded her very strongly why she never dated him before.

Guess I ought to clarify.

I live about 45 minutes away from him in another city, and we visit every other week, so about twice every month. Along with me come my four younger siblings who love to watch TV and play video games. Since there's only two rooms in the entire apartment it can be difficult to focus on my work, and my ADHD certainly doesn't help my cause. This is why I elected to stay home to study for finals, just for one week.

Additionally, my mother and father never communicate, requiring me to act as a proxy between them to negotiate plans and pickup locations/schedules. Ofttimes one of them is tired or has work or has to study for whatever, leading to weeks or months without seeing my father.

Lastly, since my mother and father split back in 2010, I have always spent the holidays with my father. Always. I just wanted to spend this one with my mother this time. Is that too much to ask? 

I genuinely want a stable relationship with my father but his conditional love shit is honestly pushing me away from him."

441,"Wait. You guys have been together for 4 months and you're moving to another country/city to live with him? You're already having huge issues with communication and expectations because you don't even know each other. If you really only have known him for 4 months and I'm not misreading your title, it's a LDR, and you met this guy while on vacation, you really don't know this dude at all.

I can assure you though, she didn't break up with you just because of the wedding date. It was just the final straw for her. Sorry she didn't give you any chance to resolve your issues, but it sounds like her mind is made up. "
444,Writing it out is a really good idea

451,"She pays 4x what he does into the house (he pays what is equal to ""half of his share"", in other words his payments are equal to 25% of the mortgage payments, if his maths is accurate). I'm pretty sure that's not 'expecting [him] to pay for everything'. He's getting essentially free rent and paying a bit more for groceries and utilities than he would if living alone.

Edit: I'm actually adding to this because I'm quite confused about OP's finances. He lived with parents and now lives with his GF, paying far less than her monthly. He also says that she's the type to prefer staying in &amp; making food over going out or ordering takeout. So is she demanding these vacations and insisting he pays? Is OP deciding that they should go on vacation and expecting her to pay too? Are they both deciding to go and just having absolutely no discussions about what they can afford or who will pay?

OP how are you in debt when you have just moved out of your parents' home, are paying far less than you would be if you were renting or half owned the home, and aren't going out on dates etc often?  You should not be going on multiple holidays per year if doing so is putting you in debt. Where is all your money going?"
452,"You sound very level headed and reasonable, I have to say.  I think getting engaged maybe earlier and having a long engagement might be a good middle ground.

Maybe one day you'll be supporting her while she's at home with kids.  Good luck with your training and 2020, follow your dreams too.  "
453,"You should see what the funding situation is - I know when it first came out here it was free for girls under a certain age only. If that's the case then it makes *way* more sense for her to get it now, when the argument that she'll start having sex because of it is even more patently ridiculous than it always is anyway, than waiting until she eventually loses her virginity to her nice Christian husband on her wedding night as an adult (which, lbr, probably isn't what will happen, but it could) and has to pay for it. If she ever has sex with anyone who's had sex with someone else, even if they're the only person she ever has sex with, she can still catch it, so her modesty or purity doesn't matter in the slightest, and most people don't know they have HPV because it doesn't have obvious symptoms like other STIs. Especially men, who are also less likely to get the vaccine because it's often only offered to women or seen as not very important since they're mostly just carriers."

458,"Hey there, I'm a frequent lurker/commenter over at r/personalfinance (I see you mentioned us in your post). The *resounding* answer over there is to never ever mix family and money. It just doesn't work out in the majority of cases. We get threads literally every day of parents who commit identity theft on their kids, or children who agree to cosign on a huge loan and get stuck with a horrible score when their parent defaults on it, and other such horror stories. 

A better idea would be to get them into financial counseling so that they can dig themselves out of their own hole. Give a man a fish and he'll eat for a day. *Teach* a man to fish and he'll never go hungry."
459,"Yep.  This happened with my dad.  Apparently to him, the words ""since we've had multiple previous losses and are only 9 weeks along, please don't tell anyone yet"" meant ""immediately tell whoever you want and then come back to teenlinethisisnitro and expect her to be happy you shared the news"".  Ugh.  He means well but that man is now on a serious information diet."

466,"You're both extremely bipolar as you mentioned in another comment. He doesn't want to spend time with you. He isn't satisfying your needs. There are communication issues. 

With a mental illness thrown in, this is no joke. Maybe you both need time to deal with yourselves separately. "
467,"I know you don't want to hear this but you're not going to move on from this. He seriously destroyed this relationship. I mean you can work on the relationship but it will never be what it could have been. The potential is gone, and he's just a scumbag. I mean come on, your kids deserve to have a better role model, not some dip shit who can't keep it in his pants. 

You deserve better, and you really need to start working on your self esteem. If it were just you its your life you can pick and choose who you date. But you have kids and they can't be getting tied up with losers like him. 

You're young, you seem to have a good head on your shoulders and you play video games which is awesome. So meet someone else who likes video games but will treat you with the respect you deserve. Not some douche canoe who cheats. "
468,"Whether to stay at home or not is not really a choice if childcare is not affordable to all women. Why on earth should you go to work if all you do is pay out everything you earn back out? If you get bored at home, or start going stir crazy then you have the option to go back to work. That's your choice.

Your mom isn't really progressive because she doesn't really want women to have a choice, and she's not seeing the reality of how much childcare costs. She's also tied her self worth to what job you do, because that makes her look good (at least in her mind).

I'd be so mad after that email. Would really losing your temper with her work on her? Maybe she needs to know how mad you are about her behaviour and her lack of support. "

472,"Don't go back for more of this, OP. See an attorney about child support and custody. See a therapist about your self-esteem. Take a break from dating while you rebuild, then move on. You're so young. You can have a better life with a loving partner."
473,"I agree with you so much.

I proposed to my fiance. I'm not sure when he ever would have brought it up, but he was thrilled. Not saying OP's boyfriend will be, but rather that I would have wasted a lot of time and emotion if I'd just waited and waited for him to make the choice to propose. "
474,"Wait what?  

You guys weren't exclusive, ergo, you have no basis to feel angry or betrayed about her behavior during that period.  

She's being very smart by refusing to discuss details with you, and I recommend you don't push her for them.  She's got you correctly pegged as a person for whom knowledge of details will just make you even more hurt, controlling, and angry."

yikes."
482,"Especially as women are often told they don't initiate enough and that we are lazy about making our men feel wanted.  In my experience  (of much rejection when I've tried to initiate) if a dude isn't already initiating,  he isn't in the mood. It sounds like a big jump to conclusions, but I've asked around and other people have experienced the same thing. It is crushing to the self esteem when I think about how my partner can seduce me and turn my initial reluctance  into a burning fireplace of passion, but I can't do the same for them.  No is just...no."

484,"Armchair diagnosis: she has a crush on your boyfriend, is using him as an emotional crush, and trying to get him to ""save"" her from a bad situation. 

""She's asked before to make sure that I am happy with my boyfriend speaking to her, which of course I am, but I feel like this is just getting a bit too much for my liking.""

Aaand she's trying to convince him that he's unhappy in his relationship.

Here's another question: do they hang out a lot after work? Are they friends in other ways? Do the three, or four, of you hang out?

If not, why is your boyfriend her best resource for advice?"
485,"Oh lord no! 22 is still a baby! Your brain is barely finishing up it's development!

You can do this. People like us are overly sensitive, we feel every thing to the point of it being overload and we numb out.  

By the time you're 25 your life could be 180 different. Just keep making the very best choices each day and when you do make a mistake ***do not*** let yourself get into a self defeating cycle. Just move forward. One day you'll look up and realize life is kind of OK.  And later you'll feel life is actually pretty cool.

487,"I haven't had a manager search me, but I had a manager that called me a liar and a brat to my face very loudly in the store I worked at. She made my life hell, and when speaking up to management above her I was shut down. Honestly, leave that place if possible. Hell, transfer if you have to.   I'm sure any contract you have can be negated by the fact that your manager on duty illegally searched you in front of the clientele with no proof. She does realize that her actions ruin business, right? 

Regardless if you can't get out,  lay low for the next few months and promptly stand up for yourself. Don't allow her to bully you and don't be afraid. Tell her to roll back the tapes if she's so concerned. Tell that to anyone that accuses you and leave when you can because places like this pick on young people and obviously they get away with it too. Jobs always seem scarce but if you can sell yourself anyone will hire you for the most part. "

490,"And women don't have names equally important and representative of their tradition and family? Why is it fine for women to be expected to change but a huge deal for men? If it isn't (hint, it's extremely unfair to expect someone else to do something you feel so strongly against), then there needs to be a compromise. 

This way they're avoiding only one of them having to take the hit and sharing it, and both of their names are being incorporated into their new name, which represents both of them. This is a pretty awesome and meaningful approach which recognises the importance of the history of both their names, not just one person's, and the blending of those in the new family they're making. I would hardly call that shit, or say it's done for no reason."
491,"If you want to help her, send her one last message with the number for a domestic violence hotline, wish her luck, and then cut contact.  You don't want to get any more entangled in this than you already are, and if she wants out, she's going to have to take those steps herself.  Looking for some guy to rescue her (especially when if she can escape to the coffee shop without worrying about detection, she can just as easily look up information on a local women's shelter while she's there and get herself over to it) suggests this isn't going to be a quick or straightforward process."

Let's summarize:

* OP and BF have a good foreplay life (he can make her climax)
* OP told BF she can't always come through PIV, and doesn't *wan't* to, and is satisfied with foreplay
* BF continues to push OP and himself to the point of physical exhaustion to make OP climax, despite her saying she doesn't want it
* OP finally gives in and fakes it, to make BF stop

All of these communication problems stemmed from BF and his huge, butthurt ego, not OP. "
515,"Ghosting her shows a complete childish lack of communication. At the very least, he could have sent a text saying, ""I'm upset and need some time to think, hope you can understand.""

518,You kill everything. With magic. 
519,Quite honestly I don't think any oncologist or palliative care team would flat out recommend euthanasia or even bring it up. It's usually the patient who is the one actively seeking it out. Then the team will make recommendations on how to go about it. Generally if nothing is to be done we talk about symptom management and ensuring a pain free death. Perhaps euthanasia might have been mentioned but only as an option and I highly doubt they pushed for it. This post just seems odd 
520,"Communication. Confront, discuss, then make a decision. No need for dramatics. Sure, they could be doing the hokey pokey in their underwear, or they could be in the same city on totally unrelated reasons. Presumably you know your husband well enough to know when he's lying, and if you have any doubts, pursue a divorce anyway. If you are to the point where you're considering it anyway based off of the slim evidence you've seen without even talking to the man, your relationship is pretty well doomed anyway. "

"
525,"I would recommend putting a lock on your door and keeping all your belongings in there (maybe even investing in a mini fridge)  - but it sounds like he may just rip the lock off to get what he wants. Primary concern here should really be your safety rather than him stealing your stuff. If he's sitting outside at night with a loaded gun are you quite sure he won't 'mistake' you, your cat, or your boyfriend for aliens? 

Depending on how much you pay your grandmother (plus the cost of replacing everything he steals) moving may be the option you're looking for - even though you indicate it isn't viable. Sometimes you have to make things work (don't buy fancy shampoo and soap, cut out luxuries like alcohol for a while, religiously search through house share/apartment ads, call in favours from friends) for your own safety. 

Draw up a budget and really consider what you can cut or adjust so you can get out of there ASAP. At his age he isn't changing, and you don't have time to play nice with him until the little green men come. "
526,"Agreed!  When my marriage ended my ex was in an incredibly selfish phase in life and one that children should not be subjected to for longer periods. I recognized this and made her an offer to give her freedom. It was I raise our daughter, ask for no child support ( I make much more), took all the debt, I provide no maintenance and I kept the house which was for sale and sold a few months later. We are much happier. OP, every situation is different but you may be able to make this tough situation work in your favor. Get some strength, hire and attorney now and fight for you and your children. Your marriage is over, treat her like a business partner. No emails or texts other than items pertaining to the children or the divorce. Pining for her is only going to break your heart worse than it is. "
527,"&gt; that seems like an awful mind trick to me to tell him ""yes come in me"" if you don't really mean it.

that's really not abnormal in a BDSM situation, though.  Safewords exist, in many situations, so that the sub can, say, scream ""no, no don't!"" and not have anything stop.  BDSM is _about_ doing things you ""don't really mean,"" a lot of the time, that's why it's negotiated beforehand, as OP negotiated the ""don't come in me"" thing."
528,"This is exactly what I was thinking. Now that he's proclaimed his forever love for her in front of friends and family, it would manipulate her into looking like the bad guy if she leaves him."
529,"But even though he does it without hesitation I'm scared to ask him because the next time we have the smallest disagreement he says I'm lazy or that I'm worthless and white trash like my family and that I'd never find another man as good as he is and that i have to deal because I couldn't provide for our son like he can. So it's clear he's resentful that I asked and can't just do it all on my own.

OP left out that her husband is verbally and emotionally abusive"

533,"Seems odd that he ghosted and you have no idea why. When it's happened to me, I at least had an idea why they did it. I may not have agreed with it, but I knew. When I've done it to people, I usually tell them why, or it followed something that was self explanatory. 

Assuming that you truly have no idea, I would let your husband continue with the plans. Chances are he will be able to get some idea of what happened since they will be face to face. I would just take is the cost to find out what's going on, but that's me."

538,"There is also such a term as emotional affair. Cheating isn't always solely about kissing and having sex.

&gt; how can you be scared to lose something you don't own?

But there *is* a bit of emotional ""ownership"" of people in relationships. I use the term ownership loosely, because we're not talking about slavery here. People assume their SO's won't be physically and emotionally intimate with anyone other than them. And tooth brushing, as weird as it may sound, *is* intimate. Especially if your friend got pleasure out of it."
539,"This is definitely suspicious. I suggest you stay up a bit later, but pretend you're sleeping and listen in to their video chats.
If they do video chat and say things like ""i love you"" or anything like that, it's over. I would highly not suggest to still stay with him because it is unlikely that he will stop talking to his friend of over 10 years.
Good luck."
540,"If he wants to kill himself, he'll do it regardless of if you serve him a restraining order or not. Get the restraining order, you need it.

553,Your husband has a psychatric emergency. He is blacking out completely when this issue comes up and it sounds like he is close to a break down. Is there any way to get him evaluated or commited? Neither him not you can deal with this situation on your own. You desperately need professional intervention.
554,I wouldn't want to be with you because you're a vegetarian. I think it's fine for you to not want to be with him because he hunts. It's just a conflict of interests.
555,"I know right, I got a justice boner that grew larger with every word."
556,"I think I'm seeing a pattern here. 

Maybe it's the language barrier, but you seem to need people to validate your feelings in order to accept their answer. 

All this person did was word it a bit different, but their meaning was the same as many people who have replied to you so far that you consider to be being irrelevant. They just said ""sure, maybe she did like you""

the wording you give that this girl ""should have"" given you has no different meaning that what she did give you. you just wanted her to say she liked you, to validate you. She went with ""I don't want more""rather than ""I thought about it but I don't want more"" so to you, you think it is lying and it's wrong.

Maybe you have some issues you need to sort out there. Good luck with that. "

You've probably already told your brother something similar, but make a few things 100% crystal clear to him 

- He is choosing the side of someone who tormented you for years, and has shown not even an iota of apology or remorse. He KNOWS what she did to you. And by choosing her, he is basically saying that the fact that he is, for some reason, attracted to her, holds more weight then what she did to you. If that's the choice he makes, that's unforgivable. Doesn't matter if they break up after one week, or one year. It will NEVER change the moment when he made the choice between you and your bully. Nothing he can ever say or do will *ever* cancel out that betrayal. His actions will have consequences."

568,"Has it occurred to you that her not wanting to date you before may have had nothing to do with your wealth and you're reading too deeply into this?

She could have turned you down for: only seeing you as a friend, trying to focus on school, no real desire to date anyone, has a crush on someone else and is working up the courage to ask THEM out, coming to terms with sexuality (possibly bisexual or demisexual), and on and on. 

AND, even setting aside the money stuff, it's entirely possible that you've just matured, personality wise, and she found you more engaging now. Or her tastes changed (I used to HATE eggs with a passion right up until age 20 but actually enjoy them a lot now)! It happens!

The fact that you guys ""drifted apart"" after you confessed to her kinda implies that either a) you came on too strong so she pulled away or b) that you pulled away once you realized you didn't have a chance with her, implying that you weren't really friends with her in the first place.

(BTW, girls talk about their jobs with each other and other people, dude. It's a perfectly normal ""getting to know you"" topic, especially if you have an interesting job!)"

571,"&gt;  I just need some help on coming to terms with my family being split up and being removed as a very hands on father and being an every other weekend daddy who pays for his kids and doesn't raise them.

Why does it have to shake out like that? Why can't you co-parent 50/50? Most family court horror stories are about guys who just didn't make the effort to assert their legal rights - well, yeah, the way court works is that it's *your* job to advocate your interests, the only person who's there to do that for you is your own lawyer.

&gt; How do I deal with not making pancakes in the mornings or reading bedtime stories at night? How do I deal with the thought of another woman taking my place on family vacations?

I don't understand why any of that has to happen. You're divorcing on good terms, one presumes. At least, you will if neither of you lose your shit and act like adults. Why can't you have a guest room at her place? Co-tuck the kids in, sleep over, make pancakes in the morning. Not every time, sure, but I bet you don't make pancakes every morning, either. Eventually she's got a girlfriend or wife - and you will again too, one assumes - and then maybe you want to not be in each other's space so much, and to allow your kids to get to know your new partners. Eventually you want some space to get over your ex, too. But there's no reason you have to go from ""married with children"" to permanent estrangement."
572,"&gt; she is basically in a relationship for economic reasons

Does her husband know that?  Because if so, she should be able to go to him and say, ""Look, we're both in this for the security and to keep our families happy; why don't we just agree a bit of fun on the side is okay as long as we're safe and discreet about it?""  And you, in turn, ought to be able to confirm with him that conversation happened if need be.  I'm guessing that's not the deal here.

Your friend made a decision to take vows she didn't believe in for bad reasons.  It may not be your responsibility to hold her to the consequences of those decisions, but don't kid yourself that the circumstances mitigate the fact that what you'd be doing with her is wrong.  And it's definitely more trouble than a friends with benefits relationship is worth.  Tell her she's on her own, cut contact, and move on."
573,"&gt; For lack of a better term, I feel we are boring

You said ""for lack of a better term"", so let's try out some other terms and see if they fit better. How about ""comfortable""? ""At ease with each other""?  How about ""content""? 

If you're not happy just sitting at home, look for activities. Classes or hobbies on weeknights, or day-trips or tourist stuff on the weekend. Those 'comfortable silences' aren't bad, and you should still leave a little time for them, but if it bothers you, plan a few adventures. "
574,"He's old enough to get a job and his own place if he wants to throw parties or hangouts or whatever the fuck he wants to call them. No, I don't think he should be homeless. Nor do I believe he will be on the streets. Obviously his friends have taken him in and will most likely continue to do so.

He's not entitled to continually disrespect his mothers rules and his apologies are meaningless and she knows it. He doesn't even understand why he should be apologizing. You can't say sorry and keep doing the same thing, which is what he's been doing.

This will be a good life lesson for him. He'll have to grow up real fast and it sounds like this is exactly what he needs. She's giving him the boot and hopefully the kick will be hard enough to dislodge his head from his ass. "
575,"Your baby isn't going to care about multiple cares or fancy cars, but they are going to wonder why you prioritized meaningless objects over making sure they have their dad in their life."
576,"&gt;but he went and signed a lease. He didn't tell me until Monday when everything hit the fan. All weekend he was kind and loving and affectionate. 

This is honestly disturbing that he could go about his life like normal knowing what he had done behind your back. I'd thank my lucky stars that this guy is gone. I know it seems hard now. He doesn't love you. You don't do this to someone you love. "
577," It was perfect for me before I met my gf, and has been perfect for me since she moved in.

...

but there are two of you now, and i you're uncomfortable about that, it's ok....for you.. prob not for her. 

You should probably talk to her, not to us."
578,Things like this makes me consider just being single for the rest of my life
579,"&gt; To try to prove that he is lying. 

And how would that work out? Either he doesn't react, which is ridiculous because that doesn't mean he has ""no issues""; or he WOULD react, which could be anything from curling up in trauma to punching her. Believing someone was lying isn't a free pass to ""test"" their mental/physical issues. It's like trying to induce a seizure on someone because you don't believe they have epilepsy. Feeding someone peanuts because you don't believe they're allergic. Exposing someone to war photos because you don't believe they have PTSD. 

See what I mean? She may have had all sorts of justified reasons to not believe him but the way she handled it was disrespectful and irresponsible... downright rude, if you ask me."
580,"You need to go and get fitted to find your real bra size, because genuine 32DD is small, you say yours are big and stick out, that means you're bigger than a 32DD and you're wearing the wrong size bra which can cause pain and make them stick out more"
581,"You're both very young and I can understand her fear of being married and committing so early. However, you two were also in a 7 year relationship. She should've shown you more respect than coming out of the blue and deciding that she wanted to be free and single. I can also understand your anger towards her. When my previous ex boyfriend tried crawling back into my life like he deserved it (actually his words were: ""I LET you date other people"", even though he broke up with me and wanted nothing to do with me), I had a really odd feeling of anger and hate and absolutelt zero positive emotions. If you truly want to get back with her, I would make her work for it. However, if you don't love her anymore, cut her loose, simple as that. She needs to realize that she can't just jump back into a relationship with you when she feels like it."
582,"Dude, please, you need to seek help. You're going to end up hurting yourself."
583,"I was gonna say that I never want to talk about my first love either. It's not that I have any feelings or what-ifs, I'm just inexplicably uncomfortable talking about it. But this is over the top weird. How old is this laptop? 

Like someone else said, I would confront him and try to drag it out of him. If he doesn't give you anything to go on when pressed about the name and his recent behavior then you may have to tell him you found the insane folder. 

It's very strange that he wasn't upset until he found out it was a girl. Maybe he got this ex pregnant at some point and they were supposed to have a girl? Maybe there was a miscarriage, or the ex died after the broke up? This is wild speculation of course, I'm just trying to think of reasons he would be acting this way. 30-year-olds don't tend to hold candles for relationships that ended 10 years ago so it just seems like something unusual would have had to happen to make him feel guilty or sad or whatever this far into the future."
584,It certainly looks that way when you are fucking. 
585,"You can't latch on to the first person who makes you feel warm fuzzies. You have to learn how to be there for yourself and how to meet your own emotional needs instead of looking for someone to provide it. Before you look for love and compassion from others, show yourself the love and compassion to get out of this seriously dangerous situation. There are worse things than being alone. Would you rather be dead? That's where you're headed. You are the perfect target for an abuser. By your own description, you're naive, inexperienced, isolated, desperate, and willing to put up with anything to avoid being alone. This guy knows exactly what he is doing. He's already escalated to extreme physical violence in less than 2 months. He is not going to stop, he's going to get worse. You've passed his test--you've shown him that he can do whatever he wants to you, with no consequences. 

Successful men who beat (and in one case killed) women in their lives: OJ Simpson; Johnny Depp; Chris Brown. Criminals aren't afraid of the law. That's what makes them criminals. "
586,"What the fuck? What kind of disgusting slob nuts all over the fucking sheets and just continues to sleep on them without cleaning? That's one step above the cumbox story. Parking like a goof could be considered a bad habit and more absent minded, leaving shit in the toilet constantly after being reminded is pushing it, but Jesus Christ. 

In your shoes I'd consider that disgusting and disrespectful enough to be a dealbreaker if not immediately stopped. Sit Brandon down and tell him how dirty that is and how uncomfortable you are with it. Tell him you will not put up with it any longer, he either jerks it like a normal person, gets a separate bed or chooses his habit over you."
587,Does he have any really good points that out weigh this behavior?  if not in my opinion he sounds a bit tapped and i would recommend making tracks and running before he gets too connected.  Just be careful if you do though as he sounds like the stalkerish type.
588,"Oh my god, really? I think staying in a hotel room with another woman, when you don't have to, without having told your wife beforehand, is pushing boundaries and betraying trust enough to count as cheating in and of itself, even if they didn't sleep together."
589,Noted. Thank you for sharing! 
590,"Honestly, that sounds worse to me. The fact that you don't *need* to live with them but still do sounds like taking advantage. Your GF should be offering to cut their hair at home, and you should see what things *you* can contribute. "
591,"So this party 4 months ago, whose friends are these? Are they just hers? Are they friends of yours as well?


The reason I ask is that this dude felt comfortable enough around these people to kiss your wife."
592,"No no, don't do that. Just don't move in with those lunatics. It will only end badly. Also, stop giving them money immediately."
593,Im amazed youve lasted this long with this loser.
594,If the cigarettes mean nothing then don't pick a fight there and just get rid of them.  If there's nothing inappropriate going on then don't delete the girl off Snapchat.   Don't need to fight over every point though.
595,"Plus being 6 hours a way sounds like a really good idea. Before school starts, get a job where your school is and come back on your own. Or, go to school somewhere else. There are good colleges everywhere. As long as it is a decent school, no one cares that much when hiring you. "
596,This is really interesting. Thanks for posting this. 
597,[deleted]
598,You're the one who cancelled the date and told him you wanted to go slow... very princess-like of you to expect him to wait around for you after that conversation. 
599,"It's hard to see this ending well. She wants all the power, and has no feeling for shared fate / married life.

I can't advise you because I could never imagine living in that kind of asymmetric relationship, where you're literally paying her. Could never, ever imagine living that way.

If you can't make peace with it, then get out now, before children are involved."
600,Not inviting a spouse is just rude. 
601,"I understand that you love his children, but this really sounds bizarre.  He is proposing to move out of the family home and leave his children with you?  Is their mother totally out of the picture?  It seems to me that, if he wanted to separate from you, the normal course of action would be for you to move out alone, or for him to take the kids and leave.  "
602,"""Final farewell""...? Uhh? I hate to be that person, but how sure exactly are you that you're not secretly hoping for something to happen, or that he wants more? The fact that you said 99% sure instead of 100% sure, and the other fact that you said ""IF"" nothing happens. Don't you mean WHEN nothing happens because it 100% wont...? Jesus Christ get a grip, your poor fiance! 

If you were truly able to just be friends and are both happily committed to your current partners, why do you have to meet one ""last time"" instead of having a real legitimate friendship. "
603,"Even if sex means nothing to him morals and the safety of others should, fuck him."
604,"Well dont go for a home run off the bat man.  Just ask her out to a coffee date and see how it goes from there.  This is real life, not a lifetime movie, you arnt going to get married by some grand romantic gesture"
605,"You both work full time, the money you bring in doesn't matter, what matters is you both contribute monetarily to the household, so you should be sharing chores 50/50. And it sounds like his contribution is far from that even when he is home. So its VERY off over the course of time.

If he wants to only be responsible for contributing financially and nothing more he needs to be the sole provider so that you can quit your job and have more time to dedicate to chores, AND that needs to be a decision you come to together.

As it is now. He is pretty much living the single life while you live the life of a single parent. Leaving him wont change much and if you file for child support he'll still have to contribute financially, and because he has to schedule it he'll probably end up spending more quality time with the kids too. You aren't happy with the way things are now, you are holding house alone, you leaving would just make it official. "
606,"I mean hey if it includes free food, having everything cleaned, etc. that's a good deal but yeah it's pretty unusual to pay market rates to live at home lol. 

Then again, nothing about this particular situation is normal IMO. I couldn't really accept being in the same situation but this all seems pretty cultural."
607,"I mean, I'd be bummed if my bf and I were planning on going somewhere really nice and had been for a while, then he went with his family while I was travelling for work. But that's because our budget would be unlikely to accommodate a super nice restaurant twice and it's no longer us having a new experience together.

But this doesn't sound like that. Hopefully, she's just a little disappointed and moves on. Being disappointed is okay, throwing a tantrum wouldn't be."
608,"If that's how you want your relationships to be, by all means go for it. This isn't 1946. I don't need to be married. I can compromise and forgive and let a lot of things go. I won't change the things about me that are important to please someone who won't do the same for me, however. And I think you're in for a lot of heartache if you think you should give up important things about yourself for another person without even a second thought. You also shouldn't have pets."
609,She is essentially a single mother while he is deployed. Of course she doesn't want to give up her only support system. Jesus Christ that's not selfish. She's pregnant. 
610,"I just feel like theirs more behind this than OP listed.  Not saying he's lying but mentioning a big financial responsibility such as that plays into her moving in and why she may not be paying ""her end"". 

Just because it's (the condo) rented out does not mean that she is not still charged with its care and matanaince etc.

Also, at the point when she chose to move in fully, I would assume it came up, even in casual dinner conversation that she was planning to rent it out. 

Why didn't OP bring up then the idea of cost/splitting bills or did he tell her he would take care of it considering he made more?

Just looking for some missing clues to the puzzle."
611,"That kind of what makes this so sketchy from my point of view. Maybe he wants to dump all this on her plate after they get married and ask ""Well Wife what are we going to do about this?"" . "
612,This would be the first time although one of her good friends did tell me that she used to talk about him a lot at work a few months ago. Her friend chalked it up to the new guy in the office looking like him??
613,"Tell him that, and that dude will have no self esteem for the foreseeable future."
614,"Ooh, I'd be super mad. You're now their glorified babysitter without your permission. You will be expected to keep tabs and keep them out of trouble. If they're out of food they'll be at your place, if they're out of detergent they'll be at your place, if they're bored they'll be at your place. The moment they get in trouble your parents will be asking you how could you let them. And I'm pretty sure your fiance is going to react to this quite negatively too. If you don't have a backbone your marriage is effed before it starts. The fact that you're only conflicted and not breathing fire tells me you need to create boundaries asap. You'll be super lucky if your siblings avoid you at all costs but what's the chance of that. "
615,"Anyone can change. But here's the key....stop planning...and start doing. Go out for a run today. Start your new diet changes now. Explore a new hobby this weekend (I recommend something outside. Hiking is good.)

Actual change requires action, not planning. Do it :)"
616,"&gt; He yelled at me to get out 
&gt; He's REALLLLLLY mad at me right now
&gt; now he is super pissed at me for acting ""crazy"". 

All just a joke, right."
617,[removed]
618,"What a load of crap. When I was younger, I wish I had the option of someone taking me in. I would be on my best behaviour at a friend's house, hoping they would like me enough to stay. I thought that maybe the foster system would be better than this, even if my siblings and I were split up.

It honestly would not have crossed my mind to do something so publicly humiliating to a parental figure just because they threatened me to clean my room. I would have been grateful for the chance to live somewhere else with someone who cared. Does that mean I would have kept that room spotless? Probably not, as I'm still a messy teenager but I would have just cleaned up.

Plus with only a 7 year age difference, OP really doesn't have the experience or maturity to be a parent of a rebellious teen. They're more similar as peers than a father-daughter relationship. Either way, at 17 she should know better, and the intent behind her actions is pure betrayal, not just acting out like some child having a tantrum at a grocery store.

At the end of the day, OP is not her dad and he doesn't have to put up with teenage abuse. He can wash his hands of her if he wants to."
619,And I thought jar of spiders guy was cruel.
620,"Yes you tell your wife. It'll come out sooner or later and it's always so much better if it's sooner and it's you doing the telling. Tell it like you have just told it to us. Honestly. Humbly. She will likely be hurt and shocked. Perhaps don't spend time alone with your SIL in the near future. Maybe it was a daft one off. Maybe she has a crush. Either way keep a distance for a bit. I hope you can all move past this, it sounds like you have a happy marriage and that these sisters are also v close."
621,yeah seriously way to brush that under the rug OP. He thinks you can't take care of yourself and the PA is incompetent because women aren't as smart or capable as men. How can be in a partnership with someone who looks down on you?
622,"Yes...... This.... 

This woman needs professional help. 

You cannot and should not and shouldn't even try to help her. 

You need to leave for your own safety."
623,"Have you noticed that every comment so far has said you're wrong, yet you just ignore it?

You're wrong.  Stop ignoring it.  Focus on your husband.  To remove all doubt, yes, your friend has noticed, and no, she won't be your friend much longer.  Then you get to explain to your husband why.  Then, possibly, you'll get to explain to your divorce attorney why."
624,"From what you have described he appears to be a rude, condescending, intolerable jerk. Don't let him talk to you like that."
625,"I dunno a lot of narcs start clubs or beleive they're destined for greatness, despite any evidence to the contrary. 

Plus that re-spinning to make it all her kid's fault, oh yeah, that is classic narc. Like the time I was 8 and somehow ""faked the need for glasses."" Until I got an eye exam, then she was the perfect mother who felt so bad for her baby having to suffer."
626,"&gt;Well for one i am allowed to have friends over when she is here and drink with them. 

When she's there. You could have probably avoided all of this by asking her permission."
627,"I'm sure sharing will be painful. But informing her is arming her. Not just against her mother, but against anything similar that may happen to her. Write out what you want to share so you have something to refer to if your thoughts and emotions flounder."
628,"It's very commendable how you've stepped up and become your sister's guardian! I think teaching responsibility is great, but I don't think birth control is the way to do this, get the IUD. While there is some partying in school I think your sister has crossed the line, and some of the drugs she is using are very detrimental to mental health and do very real pervasive neurological damage. I think she should take an intermediate course on drugs and alcohol so she can make more informed decisions. I also think she needs therapy to figure out the motivation behind the drug use. Your sister has suffered major trauma at a young age, and again with her current situation. She is at risk for addiction and now is the time to take action.

I am sorry for both of your losses."
629,"Close but not uncommon for people do in office setting when talking to someone at a desk. 

What would going to her supervisor do? How would she benefit? This wasn't harassment or anything over the line. The most that will happen is she hurts her career. "
630,"I don't want to sound like I'm casting judgements, but you seem to frame this entirely from the perspective of how *his* difficulty is affecting *you*, which is fair, but when you gloss over stuff like this:

&gt; The difference is he would sit me down and say ""please don't push me away, you gotta listen to me"" when I was lashing out

I can't help but point out to you that this:

&gt;but I can't help but feel like I just want to wait it out... maybe he'll come back, my best friend

Sounds pretty narcissistic. If this has been going on for 3 months and you've nagged him to see a therapist with no change, then that's a different story.

&gt;...and just want to sit on the couch together for a whilte and joke and laugh like we used to... I don't think that's too much to ask but maybe for him, it is.

He does too. That's why you, as the SO not-in-crisis do your best help him and make him feel loved, rather than get upset that he isn't reciprocating. His capacity for love is compromised right now (I am not advocating that you become his doormat but this has been brief enough that you can do a lot to help at this point).

I don't think you are being unreasonable by wanting this situation to improve for yourself. But I think you need to look at how you can put in some more effort as well, and you really need to tell him this. You might as well show him your post."
631,"You mention twice about your issues with other people being a ""cultural thing"" and it makes me worry about how attitudes towards other cultures intersect with your mental illnesses. Can you clarify?"
632,You can tell the nationality of a white blonde just by looking at them? That's quite a skill 
633,"Lawyer up, this could bite you in the ass in future. At minimum you're owed a public apology."
634,"sweet jesus you do set yourself up for drama don't you?

Stop. Seeing. This. Person."
635,"I wonder if OP could contact the Hispanic group and ask them to speak to the neighbors and help them with whatever is making them so angry. Them slashing tires and harassing neighbors isn't something that is good for them either, so the Hispanic advocacy group might be able to talk some sense into them. "
636,"Well as long as you're on the same page, then I think you're okay. The only thing I would say is to be careful that she might say one thing and feel differently. You have to know if she's the type of person who bottles things up. If she starts to build up resentment then that makes things much more difficult. 

I was in that situation my first year in med school. Even though my girlfriend said she was fine, I could tell the lack of time we spent together was killing her. I had to end the relationship because I knew she would just go on being miserable. 

Either way, good luck man!"
637,I'm assuming by removing the abuser from the home he can stop trying to crush his daughter's self-confidence into the dust and she can get back to enjoying the game she loves. 
638,"I don't know if you are in the US, but if you are and are in a state like CA with stringent laws, you can inform them you need special accommodations due to disability (ADA laws), which if the accommodations are not completely interfering with your ability to complete tasks (i.e. No driving for a bus driver) they may be able to give to you accommodations (private area, small room, etc) after proper documentation. I dunno if things are gonna change now and the laws in your state. I would research this.

I would try OT for hypersensitive hearing. It may help you desensitize.

Finally, one thing I may bring to your attention: each family is it's own culture, please do not say messiness is cultural. I know some ppl from my culture that are slobs, I know some that are super clean. To label a whole culture as messy slobs cause of a few isn't cool dude.

"
639,So husband doesn't care that he cut contact with you without reason and will be able to have fun with him using the gift you gave them both?
640,"Dude, that's not cool.

Apologise, then assume she'll dump you, as she should

You dont pressure someone into physical stuff, not by force but not by words either"
641,"Keep in mind this is his sister- so they probably expect you to be quite involved in this child's life. I would ask my siblings + their partners to get vaccinated but wouldn't ask my friends. This is why it's been mentioned this time and not others. Maybe by questioning whether it was weird to be asked by his sister you accidentally implied that you didn't expect to be around his niece/nephew much? Or even just compared it to friends having a baby when perhaps it's quite monumental for him. Not saying that was in any way intentional but it could perhaps be why he was touchy. He was taking your remark as ""why would I need to do this for your sisters baby?"" "
642,"You are defending him, so you dont see him as a bad guy, but are you really surprised at the other people's reactions?  Its very coincidental but there is another post about a guy who is vegan and harassing the other coworkers.   

You cannot fix this for adrian, you will only get yourself excluded.  His approach was poorly thought and insulting so its his loss.  I would stop worrying about it and find something more important to focus on. Its his life, his actions, and his problem.  "
643,This is rough. If it were me I would print it out and find a marriage therapist before he gets home and make an appt and tell him what you found and that then both of you need counseling. Hopefully it was just a venting process from your rough patch but even so I would seek out marriage counseling to help heal the hurt and also to help communication in the future. 
644,"Yeah, the circumstances are so ridiculous that it makes me think it's trolling. People like this drive me nuts because they make vegetarians look like assholes. "
645,"If it's gotten to the point where you have to grey rock your girlfriend, she probably shouldn't be your girlfriend."
646,I don't think the length should matter. Someone who tends to add a lot of details can easily rack up 19 pages in a venting process.
647,It sounds like he is showing signs of hoarding. Buying these figures is filling some emotional need. It's the buying part that gives the rush and then the thrill of possession that keeps him from getting rid of them. Hoarding can be very difficult to treat but it's early for him and therapy might help.
648,"The analytical way you phrase your sentences comes across as overly mechanical and indicative of either a mental condition that alters your perspective yet still allows you to behave reasonably normally in social situations; OR a defence mechanism against underlying rage, as the above poster mentioned. 

Don't undermine your parents. Imperfect they may be, but they are entitled to their concern about your well-being, just as you are entitled to live the way you choose. But I have a hard time believing that you would even logically conclude there is no reason to maintain a relationship with them. You do show that you find it unreasonable to cut them off if you can find a way to sort this out and make yourself heard. You can defend your rights to your life and also remember to be empathetic to others, especially since you realize that your life preferences are not the standard. "
649,"Honestly, I'd ice them out. If they can't be considerate of you, you don't have to be of them. If they're at your home and speak with you reply in short, curt responses and continue on with what you were doing. You don't have to be polite to them, they've already shown you that they can't return the favor anyway. 

And if they ask you why you're being this way, calmly let them know that your feelings were hurt and you didn't appreciate being strung along and deceived. they should know how shitty they are."
650,"If I'm being honest I don't really want to put any more time or energy into these people. Even if the story I was told wasn't exactly how it happened I know for a fact that the agreement for the last year has been that we were all going to rent a place together and instead the three of them rented a place without even telling me before they signed the paperwork.

I've already decided I'm completely done with John and Jane, just not sure how to go about my relationship with my brother. I think I need to take a few days to cool off before tackling that hurdle - I'm bridge-burning angry right now."
651,"I don't think that is a softer way. It's much harsher. I get that it's annoying when they do stuff like that, but they're more likely to respond in a reasonable manner if you explain that you have a guest list and a certain budget and would they cover the cost for their extra guests as opposed to ""I'll send the invites when you send the money"". I think it would also be perfectly acceptable to let them know that you cannot invite any more guests. "
652,"&gt; 8 years and she's setill just your ""GF""

To be fair to OP, I see far too many people here getting married after knowing someone for less than a year, then posting here to complain that it didnt work and their partner turned out to be an asshole.

I'd want to live with someone for a couple years at least before feeling that I knew them well enough to know that I'd want to marry them."
653,6 months old is still young to start the cry ut out method. 8 months is a good time to start
654,"I hate to say this, but if your gf terminates at 33, and then waits until she's ""ready"", she may find it difficult to get pregnant again. Fertility starts to decline at 35."
655,"&gt; I'm not sure it's everyone's duty to do this in all situations,

Legal duty no, but morally, if you have reasonable reason to believe that a child is being harmed, you do have a duty to try to stop the harm. Wether CPS is always the best way to do that is certainly a matter for discussion, but yes there is a duty to do something. "
656,Good. Glad it worked for you. My wife doesn't want to do it.
657,She *used* to feel comfortable.  I'm sure after his tantrum she won't any longer.
658,"Everybody has their own lines as what counts on cheating.

Your SO intended to cheat and in my book, that's just as bad as actually cheating. It's even fishier that he is so suspicious of you but acts suspicious himself."
659,"Thank you, I had to scroll way too long to see the word selfish. I have never seen a post so carelessly disregard an SO's perspective. I don't think he really understands, and doesn't want to understand, what hell he put her through. He's putting the nice guy coins in the sex vending machine and nothing's coming out because he fucking broke the vending machine and raided it of all it's stock a few weeks ago and didn't restock at all! (sorry to compare a woman to a vending machine, but this reeks of that friendzone/nice guy scenario x100000 because they're married) He started running and gave her a book! WTFFFFF.

edit: wait a minute, she said she's considering leaving you and you think your relationship is in a ""weird"" place? I sincerely hope you get the help you need because there's something very wrong with your perspective on relationships."
660,"If a condom had broken on me when I also knew I was changing over my bc pills, it would have been time for the morning after pill discussion. 

Preventing a (potential) implantation is a lot less rough of an emotional and physical decision than having to terminate an actual fetus that has been existing in my body for over two months. 

It seems like both of you were a little slack with your birth control here. Nevertheless, please don't put pressure on her to terminate. It's not an easy decision to make at all, and if she makes it she will need to feel 100% responsible for making it on her own. If she feels coerced at all it could cause her severe trauma. "

662,"You can't change her. But you can try to protect any kids they may have. Call CPS. Over and over if needed, if you have concerns the kids are unsafe. Your cousin is choosing a shitty path and won't change until she wants to. But kids don't deserve to be stuck because of their parent(s). "
663,I just wanted to comment the first thought in my head is that you guys are Ross and Rachel. Friends were probably trying to be funny and it was just one of those things that is funnier in their head rather than saying it out loud. 
664,"that doesn't change anything. you don't get extra points for NOT continuing when someone says stop. that is basic sex 101. that is mandatory behavior. it doesn't offset the fact that he did something without consent, and in anger."

666,"This is one of those you can't put the genie back in the bottle situations.

If one partner is happy with monogamy and later finds out the other isn't it is a fundamental shift in the marriage. For some people it is just a fun suggestion/something to consider, and for some it's a horrible realization of not being enough. Add on top of that her insistence that you go through with it when you clearly didn't want to, now you have a worry where before you had none.

Your relationship will be different now, all you can try and do is find a way forward. And a counselor to help you with that is highly advisable. A building block of being married for you was just cracked. "
667,"No. I don't think you're being rude. And I understand your incredulousness. It's hard to explain why I've been (seemingly) chill. His work stuff, for example, requires being away from home for 3-4 days at a time, every few days. So the intermittent silence has been the norm for a while and we've just been working around it. And I know his regular stress response (shutting down) That's why I didn't think too much of it at first. I'm not being cold. I was just thinking things were the normal bad (for now), if that makes sense? Hitting the 5 wk mark is what threw me. "
668,"Totally get that it's super annoying to be touched by someone against your will, but...

You've been there for 2 MONTHS and you're still fuming about what happened on DAY 3??? To the point that you'd like 
&gt; clever suggestions on how to get revenge on someone who violated my personal space in the office ???

You need to worry about going to work, doing your job well and then going home. You're not there to make friends and if you're the joke of the office after all this time then it's probably you that's sending off negative vibes that people are just feeding off of. For them to truly consider you the joke of the office after something that happened 2 months ago just doesn't make any sense unless you've kept it going somehow...whether you know you did or not. 

Get over yourself and move on. Take the higher ground and stop looking for revenge! BTW, that goes for any situation. Revenge is never good and it just brings you down to their level and makes you look petty along the way. 

Be better than that."
669,"He doesn't need to pretend. But the discussion needs to be more productive than ""I want you to move here now, if we don't we're taking a break"". That's some manipulative bullshit right there.

If he actually wanted anything other than just his way, he'd talk, make it clear that it's not the job, it's the distance that he didn't think would be long term, and they'd come up with some compromise - they move somewhere between the two locations, they agree to only do LDR for a year, one of them commutes, whatever. It doesn't seem as though any kind of compromise was offered here."
670,"... why does it matter if they hook up? I don't see this as an issue at all, so what's gotten you so worried?

&gt;I have no interest in living with two people who are having sex with each other

Again - why does it matter? If you're worried about sex noises, you can confront them IF they start getting loud. If you're worried about them breaking up and the situation getting tense, you can confront them IF that happens. But I don't get why you're so worried about them having sex in the first place if nothing's happened yet."
671,I feel bad for the parents and sister. Two mooches living off of them while ruining an innocent childs life.

676,"Retail isn't exactly comparable to a proper 'sales' job. Sure you are encouraged and rewarded for up-selling but I don't think anything she has described as doing is 'wrong'. I used to work retail in Harrods and we were discouraged from trying to oversell too much as it could put customers off and appeared tacky, if she is working in the same sort of luxury department I think she is doing her role completely correctly.

This thread of hope you have going on is so sad, and I think now you have posted it, you must realize it is hopeless.

679,"OP is a great example of what's typically been called ""schizoid personality disorder""--they just don't feel a need to form relationships. Debatable whether it's worth a diagnosis, because they're not hurting anybody or themselves.

I can see as a parent why it would be upsetting; it's very hard for most people to imagine how that life can be anything but pathological and unfulfilling. "

683,"Right? 


OP, I'm still struggling to find a reason why you or your SO are even upset about these people cutting you out. I haven't seen one reasonable thing about any of them, and the fact that some dumb fucker literally shit himself because you were dating someone is just about the saddest and funniest thing I've ever heard. They're embarrassing people and you shouldn't miss them at all."
684,"Only toddlers can get away with saying ""I just can't"".  He is a grown man who has been sleeping by himself for decades.  He also somehow manages to sleep on the nights when he doesn't spend them with you.  Ask him why.  Tell him that HE needs to figure this out and come up with a solution that doesn't include you.  He is an adult.  Adults are responsible for managing their own sleep needs without infringing on the well being of others.  Forcing you to lie in bed when you are not sleepy or not ready to go to bed is not fair to you.  You need to explain that to him.  If he has someone how trained himself to only be able to sleep with you there,  he needs to do the research and speak to a doctor about his sleep needs because that is not healthy behavior for either of you two."

686,"I mean sure, if you're dating someone whose personal communications can be considered a garbage dump. I think most people in normal, happy relationships don't talk to other people behind their SO's back like that. I'm positive that OP's girlfriend would know that OP wouldn't approve of her talking to her ex that way.

I like to think that I've become a good enough judge of character in my old age to dodge these sorts of situations for the most part. In general, just don't date people who you have to snoop on to keep in check. These types of people will always disappoint you."

* What is the problem
* Why is it a problem (it is not good for her, she needs to be comfortable with other people, etc.)

That should be enough."

693,"That puts a slightly different spin on it.  Lets say you've been sexually active for three years, i.e. since you were 19.  That's one partner per year.  Not excessive.
If you assume he also started having sex at 19, that's 1.1 partners per year.  Not really that different."
694,"You need to get a paternity test. You also need her, despite the pregnancy, to step up and talk to you. Crying is excusable from hormones. Stalking her ex-boyfriend behind your back can't be explained and brushed off from being pregnant. Is his number in her phone? Is it possible he is listed under a different name, even a female one, or is using a hidden app to message him? Which friends house is she at? She begs you to look at her phone? If her rationale doesn't make sense, ask her to show you her bill, which shows text messages."
695,She really does. And why is she doing the whole thing while he is out of the country over text?
696,"I wouldn't say they never change. Certainly it is possible some haven't. There was one guy in my grade that would bully me relentlessly throughout junior high. He eventually quit going to our school, rumor was he got put in juvie and I didn't see him for a few years. Fast forward to my senior year and I walk in to one of my classes and there he was. I started to panic a bit, but just avoided him the first few weeks. Then it happened, we were put on a group project. The very first thing he did was apologize to me. He was genuinely, sincerely sorry. Working that project we became friends. I ended up inviting him to our school club, and we ended up going to a national competition together and placing. It gets even better. A few years later I end up dating my wife. We get engaged and ran into him one day, I find out he is her cousin.

So that's how he went from bully, to friend, to family!"
697,"&gt;Then I started arguing about my answers to her questions, asking her to explain WHY she didn't like them,

Here's a hint--never, ever do that again.

She put down a boundary. The ONLY thing for you to do at this point is respect it.

There's nothing to hash out. She does not want to be in a relationship with you. She owes you nothing.

&gt;And i'm just left feeling...angry!

Deal with it. That's all between your ears, it's no fault of hers.

&gt;She didn't even give us a chance!

She doesn't have to.

&gt;She didn't even _try!_

First of all, she doesn't _have to._ She doesn't owe you anything just because you are attracted to her. 

Secondly, yes, she did.  She went on a date with you. And then after that date, despite whatever red flags your conversation with her raised, she went on _another_ date and laid everything out honestly.  She gave it a great big try, and the answer to the question of ""would this work?"" is no.  You don't get to tell her she didn't try enough.
 I think she's behaved very sensibly here.

699,"She isn't coming back, there's no way to ""win"" her back, neither things you'll want to hear I understand but first things first;

*Put your kids at the heart of everything you do. Always.
*Then yourself. Focus on friends, family, hobbies, new interests etc.
*Don't beat yourself up, wonder if you could've done X differently or seen Y sooner. You couldn't. Willing to bet she's wanted to leave for a little while and through time made that her goal. It's why she can move on so quickly. It's not quick, she moved on some time ago now I'm afraid.

She's being harsh, brutal, savage and callous. Don't let that become you though. Stand up for yourself, sure, but otherwise YOU are your focus now after the kids. 

The fact she's wanting to know when your moving out sounds like she's dying for some privacy with him, chances are they've not had it before and she at least is getting impatient. Wanting her children out the way means she gets to just be her, doing what she wants, how she wants etc.

With you being together since you were 14 probably means you've never had anything with others, 20 years is a long time and I bet it's been eating away at her to try new things etc. It's vile but that's probably what it is. She wants to do all the exploring, adventure bollocks whilst not having to think about you or the kids. Like I said it's callous and brutal and savage. It's selfish.

It's going to take you time, obviously, but you WILL get past this. It won't be easy, obviously, but you CAN manage this and not sink to her level of selfishness.

Divorce, find somewhere new, make it a place and space for you and the kids so that when you have them (I'm assuming shared parenting is going to happen) they love being with you. Be there for them - take strength in the fact that whilst she evidently not longer feels for you how you feel for her your children will always adore you. 

I'm in the same boat, relationship breakup etc, sounds less callous and harsh than your situation, I can get through it through making it about my son, me and our future. What the Ex does is her business so long as it doesn't impact my son or the relationship between my son and me. 

Stay strong OP - It'll be tough for a few weeks, but you will begin to get clarity and find your footing. You've weathered the trials of a couple of kids, the tiredness, the tantrums etc - you will be able to deal with this. :)"

-she's asexual or very low libido
-she's not attracted to you
-she has past trauma like sexual abuse or rape
-she has sensory processing issues

Whatever it is the way forward would have been communication so you could either work out the issues or end it. You may want to let her know that her unwillingness to communicate is what is motivated you to end it. "
703,Please say that you just mistyped and meant to say won't be moving in. 
704,"I know you have. And I don't want to be harsh on you. And you've already taken steps to solving this.

It's a little late sure, but you're working on it now and it's better late than never.

Your relationship with her will change; you won't fear her anymore, for one. Your GF will be so happy to see that you do actually care enough for her and your relationship to stick up to your mom. 

You might feel uneasy about it and it might be awkward at first. But your mom will come around, you'll both set a groove that works for everyone. And she'll realize, from that conversation, she won't be able to make you fear her. 

What are you afraid of, btw? I can tell you that she'll never cut off or out of her life. But if she does over this, realize she was always going to be toxic and did you a favor.

It'll be tough, it'll take time. But I do applaud you for taking the steps to get this sorted out. Too many men are put in your position by their crazy, possessive mothers who don't want to let go of their baby boys. And they never figure it out or just play oblivious to not ""rock the boat""

At least this way, hopefully, as years pass and damage is healed, a *healthy* relationship can develop between your mom and GF/wife.

Update us! Good luck, man. You got the right idea. "
705,"&gt; many years ago..not with a person though..went to an event and it wasn't sanctioned by her...it wasn't cheating.....just a breach of trust though.

Your bro may be too independent and proud to take cash help, but perhaps you could give some gift certificates for local stores &amp; restaurants to them to help them out. The other suggestions for photos are good. 

Think about what the kids in particular love: they've lost all their toys, clothes, possessions... The adults, too, but my heart goes out especially to kids.

We had some friends whose home burnt down, but they were there and badly injured. I bought a lot of fancy food treats &amp; some books for the hospital stay, and we put as much $$ as we could afford in a plain envelope and passed it over. "
710,"Everyone is giving great advice so I thought I'd just point out the obvious. Did you or your husband research caring for a dog at all? In particular, did you research caring for a boxer? I'm not trying to come off accusatory - boxers are known for being needy and high energy. It sounds like you didn't really think things through (you say you just want a cat-like dog, and a boxer is the complete opposite of that), decided to just give in to your husband without addressing your concerns, or you tried to do so and your husband completely ignored you. Which is it? Because therein lies the relationship problem IMO.


As for the dog, the truth is she *is* being a good dog. She just wants your attention so I can at least sympathize with your husband's frustration. You did agree to rescue this animal so I don't think it's fair to send her back just because she's being a little needy. 


It sounds like you haven't really given her much of a chance. You basically say you never really wanted her at all and are not making an effort to stimulate her or reassure her. I think you might surprise yourself to find that you might become attached to her over time if you make the effort to bond with her (which is not just feedin and opening the door to let her out). "
711,"Do you make substantially more? Because you mention ""our"" bank account but somehow she's not allowed to spend the money in it. Effectively she's paying you so she can blow you, so...I guess you're living the dream."
712,So her family doesn't like you and she thinks your family is dumb. You sat in the corner while she didn't help you. Doesn't sound good. She's too young to get to the place you're at. Not gonna be good down the road judging on your post. 
713,"My nephew was walking across the street and was  hit by a car driven by a person who was high on drugs, in his summer break after finishing high school. He was in a coma for weeks. He had to learn to walk again, and still has trouble with that and with his memory and his moods. He will never be the same. I don't know if he will be able to go to uni as he planned; it seems unlikely. Maybe if your friend really thought about the fact that he could be a murderer, or a cause of so much pain to someone else, it would encourage him to sober up."
714,"Please ignore all the responders shitting on you. You have said and done nothing wrong. You offered advice when asked, she definitively disregarded that advice in favour of her father, and you said you didn't want to be involved in any further related decisions. That's completely fair; there is nothing **overbearing** about that. 

Reading the scenario objectively, it is clear the only overbearing character here is your FIL. And yes your wife is upset, but not really at you. What's she's really upset at is her father, and more importantly the lack of control she has in her own life. And she projects that onto you because it's far easier to do that that than to confront her father. He's been around as an authority figure anywhere from 3x to 10x as long as you (not sure how long you've been married). He's moulded her to be dependent on him and undoing that bad work is going to take a lot of time and dedication. 

Your wife needs to feel autonomous in her life. She needs to feel empowered. If you want to help her with this then stop taking over financial decisions for her - help her to become educated and make the decisions on her own or together with you. As she feels more capable she'll become more resistant to her father. "
715,"She's going to need a new job ASAP. Like she cannot be around that asshole at all. Also take the day off to really collect yourself. You deserve to have some time to think.

If you have someone you can confide in I recommend you leaning on them for support. You're not alone in this. Check out surviving infidelity for some stuff to read. But really your wife needs to start making some moves to work on this. "
716,screenshots of my conversation with Craig
717,"Again, not your problem. Her loans = her problem. The more you keep enabling her, the more she's going to keep taking advantage of you. You don't have to divorce your wife, but she does need to be held accountable for her choices. She racked up those student loans and that credit card debt, so she may need to file bankruptcy for the credit card debt and then slowly pay off those student loans on her own. 

She has never taken responsibility for her debt because YOU keep taking responsibility for it. It's very apparent that this debt (that isn't even yours) is causing you stress. She doesn't feel any of that stress because by paying off her loans, you're taking that stress on yourself. Let her feel what it's like to stress about making debt payments and not being able to have fun lunches or pricey girls' nights out and see if that doesn't change her attitude regarding money real quick!"
718,"I always wonder what people think any good  ""putting a good word in"" is going to do in terms of making someone become more attractive to the person they're interested in. If someone's not going to be attracted to you when you ask them out yourself, then sorry, but it's not like a friend going, ""Awwww come on! Give him a chance, he's nice!!"" is going to make a girl go, ""Ohhh shit! My Complete lack of attraction for that dude has been completed reversed now! Just because he's nice and I should therefore give him a chance!"" *swooooooons and drops panties*. 

There's literally nothing that a friend could say to me about a dude that I'm already very much not attracted to that could reverse my lack of attraction for him. Jfc, why would you approach dating like job searching?! It reminds me of trying to use the networking connections you made to ""put in a good word"" for a job you want to apply for. Gross. "
719,"Wow 23f has you wrapped around her little finger just like she wants. Dude this is so textbook that is frustrating to see you fall for it.

I *100% guarantee* that if you had not brought up this other girl 23f would still just want to be friends and nothing more. She doesn't want to date you, but she doesn't want anyone else to have you either because it takes away from the attention you give her. She likes to have you around because she knows you have feelings for her and it makes her feel good about herself.

And don't fall into the trap of fixing someone. No one can be ""fixed"" by anyone but themselves and only if they want to be ""fixed."""
720,"Dating choices are much more complicated than that. It's not just like, ""do you check these boxes?"" It's a feel. You are (or you should be) a different person than you were in HS, and she is too. Maybe you checked the same boxes back then as you do now, but the feel is different. Maybe you give off a different vibe as a result of your success in adulthood. Maybe how she's viewed dating has changed. 

It could be something completely intangible that clicked for her. It's not just some formula and now the money variable has changed, but even if it were the difference, it could be indicative of so many other things. Like now you're showing you're responsible. Being attracted to success is perfectly reasonable, and it'd be one thing if she was asking for monetary favors but she wasn't. 

You responded with an awful lot of venom leftover from a teenage interaction, and if you don't get a handle on that shit now, your dating life will continue to be rocky because you'll project rejection and ulterior motives onto your potential dates. You're approaching your mid-twenties, it's important you work through whatever made you say what you said.  Lashing out because someone didn't want to date you is unacceptable behavior for an adult."
721,"My cousin is really beautiful and she knows it. Random strangers come up to her all the time to flirt with her. When this happens, she scrunches up her face to look confused, looks them up and down, and laughs really loudly. It's so overtly bitchy that it usually stuns and embarrasses them.

If you did this every time a guy asked you to put in a good word for Lucy, not only would you get the point across that they're not good enough for her (which they aren't if they're using you to get to her), but it'll probably be pretty satisfying, too."
722,"I wouldn't ask/make the friend do it, it's just as awkward for them too. I'd just pack his stuff up and put it outside and he can pick it up or donate it to charity, he left without it and without taking things on his own terms, his problem."
723,"I want to reiterate this point as well. I didn't start healing until I realized getting back into the dating pool was only making it worse for me. I focused on myself, started getting better, met someone new completely on accident. It will be lonely, but FOCUS ON YOURSELF. "
724,Thank you. 
725,"""our way""? ""we""? No. The only guys who have ever shown up unannounced to my place were the ones I was trying to ghost. It's rude and creepy to show up unannounced.

Your mother clearly is about as immature as a high schooler. I hope to God this guy she left for dumps her ass in a month so she realizes what an fucking idiot she is. 

Second, I don't believe it's needed for you to postpone graduation. If possible, fly out to your sister on the weekend so you guys can make a game plan. Clearly none of this was expected. Make plans with each other this week and call family members to see who can help. Of course, she doesn't want to move around which is understandable, but the only way I see her not moving is if your grandmother gives her the ok to live there. Maybe even ask for some funds from your biological father to help with transportation and such. I know she can't get a job at all, but those are the logical chances I could see happening if your grandmother allows her to stay there. 

I hope all turns out well. I can't believe someone would go this far for a guy she probably just met. It's disgusting the things some people do to their family over something so small like a boyfriend. Just be there for your sister. She's getting the worst end of it as I'm sure you already know. Good luck with graduating and please keep us updated! Prayers are going out to you and your sister!

754,"Your anger and hurt is valid.

Take some time away from him, especially as he apparently gives no shits about your pregnancy. He seems very quick to jump on the train of 'how dare you tell us, now when you have a miscarriage we'll be upset!' without ever bothering to extend enough empathy to realise that the *reason* you've told them is you *might very well* miscarry and in that case, you will be more upset than they are and will want their support. Because, y'know, they're your family.

Given he's not interested in helping or supporting you, take a break. Focus on yourself. If he asks why, tell him while you accept his apology, frankly what he said was extremely hurtful and you still aren't past it yet, especially given his lack of concern for your pregnancy given how he hasn't asked about it, and that you'll be in touch with him when you're ready.

If he's genuinely sorry, he'll understand, back off and when you do come in contact with each other, actually ask about your health and the health of the baby.

Your dad is probably afraid of losing you too because and maybe seeing your reaction as a rejection.

I mean... there are a lot of things that a lot of people do they are very much social faux pas and trespasses that are unacceptable if open.  For example thinking your buddy's gf is hot and fantasizing about her is something that would be fairly common.  Telling your buddy that you are fantasizing about his gf and all the dirty things you would like to do to her?  Hell no.

If it has been like this for a long time with little signs of progression then maybe it's time to rethink it. Even if that seems like a huge mountain it may be better for your mental health in the long run. 

I've been in a relationship with someone who I suspected had NPD and it sucks the life out of you and makes you think our crazy after a while. I think his concern with what the outside world thinks of him, the impulsiveness, the lack of empathy etc are all indicative of someone who at the very least has narcissistic tendencies. Just from what you're saying! "
768,"OP, nothing has changed about you and your husband's rocky marriage except the pregnancy. 

All the hallmarks from previous fights are still there. Clearly he's been steadily unhappy, and it sounds like in the back of his mind he truly doesn't want to be with you. But he probably doesn't want to deal with the messy fall out of divorcing at this age/stage in life so he ""comes around"" every time and makes up with you. He eventually realizes divorce is expensive and difficult and he subsequently talks himself out of the idea. That's the point where he ""comes around"" to you.  

But honestly, I would BELIEVE HIM if he says he doesn't care and invites you to leave the marriage. He doesn't care!!!!!! About you, the marriage, and your baby. 

It sounds like he just... *Puts up with the marriage* whenever you're not fighting. But when you ARE fighting, the gloves come off and he tells you how he really feels. I mean, do you think he falls out of love with you *during* the fight but magically falls back in love with you when the fight is over? It doesn't work that way honey. Depending on whether you guys are fighting or not fighting, he teeters between actively not caring about you or simply *tolerating* your presence in his life.  

If having a father for your baby is really important to you, I would suggest you reevaluate whether or not you want to continue the pregnancy because I would NOT bank on your marriage getting better, or on your husband *loving the baby*. He already said he doesn't love you and that he won't be there for the baby. Do you intend to test him on that? 

If having your baby's bio father around is not that important to you, just leave him and move on. Continue the pregnancy on your own. The guy doesn't give a shit if you stay or leave but he obviously does not want to have a baby with you.

Either way, this isn't a relationship you should be in whether there's a child involved or not. However, if there is a child involved, there's even more reason to leave. "
769,"Is it just the high number of them that bothers you or is it also the fact that this represents a somewhat large amount of money? You do need to have a discussion on this, but perhaps frame it as a discussion about finances and better investments of time/money. It'd be one thing if there was a long term value associated, but these are the Beanie Babies of the 2010s. Figure out maybe what the long term goal is here. Is he just amassing them needlessly or is there a goal? 

Perhaps having him focus on one set at a time so it slows down? "
770,"I want to make sure I understand things. This is, essentially, your house. FIL/SIL got to live there (rent-free?), and in return they were supposed to fix up the place. When your hubby got out of the army, your SIL/FIL were supposed to leave. Now your husband doesn't want to evict them even though they've trashed the place and they were supposed to be gone now anyway. 

What is your husband's defense of his sister and father? It seems like they've seriously disrespected your inheritance, ignored the original deal, trampled over your boundaries, and aren't working towards any meaningful reconciliation. Your SIL might have a mental-health issue, but your FIL and husband are enabling her. She needs help, not to be in a house where she (seems to have) no structure and access to alcohol. 

Before mentioning divorce to your husband, go talk to a lawyer. Figure out what you'd need to do with your assets and whether it's a road you wanna go down. You don't want to threaten a divorce unless you are actually willing to go through with it. In the meantime, sit down with your husband privately and talk to him about ground rules and boundaries. Don't complain about SIL/FIL or get angry, but be clear about what you want. ""How can we help your dad find a place to move? I'd like to [remodel, begin marital bliss, etc] by X date so let's help SIL/FIL move out by then."" Avoid talking about how SIL needs to be an adult - they're aware of her behavior and pointing it out won't help you. Focus on your own emotions, the results you want and the positive ways you can attain them. 

If you do all that and your husband does *nothing*, I think you'll have your answer about the long-term future of your marriage."

If he attacked or kicked him out, that may have caused a mess. But he first said ""dude I've been there man"" and also reinforced that this was a bad spot.

However; we both earn substantially more than $85k, he has no personal debt, I knew about his student loans from the get go. 

I am really confused as to how he's paying this debt. I think on $180k minimum payments were like $2.5k so let's say he's on a income based repayment and he's paying $1500, the min pay on the $15k credit card has gotta be like $750 and the loan, we'll let's say it was 5 years that's at least $1500 a month. 

If his take home is $4.5k then he's got about $150 a week for expenses... doesn't add up!  Rent? Car? Gas?

That basically makes it seem like a double date, because there's the one couple, then you and the female coworker. I wouldn't be okay with that, I'd find it inappropriate. But my boyfriend feels the exact same as me about boundaries and what's appropriate and we laid those out clearly when we became serious. So if one of us did that, we would be breaking our agreement. If you and your wife never expressed that a situation like this was or wasn't okay, then it's hard to say. I'd suggest discussing boundaries again and what makes each of you comfortable and uncomfortable. And maybe take her out a little more, hire a babysitter. In her eyes, you've left your wife at home with the kids and havent went out for a fun night with her for months while you make plans with coworkers. "

812,"I dated someone very similar to him and lived with him and my pets for about 7 years. My situation was very similar. He set ""requirements"" for living with my animals and they had to take a back seat to his minor comforts and conveniences. I allowed that. Then when they inevitably messed up (barked, meowed, lived their lives) they they would be further restricted (to the point where they spent 90% of their time locked in a room). He had nick names for them like ""mamma's boy"" and things that implied jealousy and he hated when I chose to spend time with them. He often threatened to leave if I didn't get rid of them....but, like you, I told myself that deep down he liked them and it was ok because he did care for them because he pet them from time to time and did have little games he would play when it was fun for him. I told myself he would never hurt them because he was always gentle, even when he was frustrated. Eventually they started to hiss at him sometimes or wince when he was angry, but I still did not believe he would hurt them. Then one day my dog got loose and we split up to find him. He thought I wasn't around when he caught him....by the throat and picked him up as he was choking. I am talking clawing at his hand and gagging, it was no accident. For some reason I accepted his apology, but never left him alone with them. Then a few months later I caught him kicking a dog at my moms house. I never told him that I saw that. He left me a few months later...I don't know why I didn't do it sooner, but he left and I think aggression towards the animals grew as he grew more tired of me.  "

But Jesus I cannot communicate like that! I came from a very dysfunctional home so yelling and raised voices makes me want to hide and/or pee my pants.

823,"I think OP is referring to the days that he is at home, it sounds like his wife expects him to help all the time. That's not really a recipe for success - when he has to work, he has to work and that should be his full focus. 

When he's off then dad duties are his responsibility, of course. "
824,If you ever let your boyfriend take pictures of you that you wouldn't want on the internet for others to see then his lack of response is your cue to go into disaster recovery mode. Sounds like he's likely trading them with others online. 
825,"&gt;each other's actions

What actions do you feel you get to take, here? You seem like you're railroading her into a choice she really doesn't want to make, and going on about how ""logical"" it is.  Logic would also dictate you understand that she's running up against the end of her childbearing years, and that it's a LOT safer for her to have a baby now than in a few more years..."
826,"You're so right. It's just so hard because I feel so bad when he's sad. Then he blames me for making him feel fat. One of my friends said that he's being manipulative, but I don't know..

I'm not going to comfort him anymore though. That's on him. I can't keep lying and saying he's ok when he clearly has an unhealthy lifestyle."
827,"I respectfully disagree with this advice. You can continue on the pill until the month you are ready to conceive - don't go off it if he's not ready, because that's just asking for him to make a spur-of-the-moment decision to bareback it and risk pregnancy, even if he doesn't want a baby. That's not a great way to start a family. If you are on the shot it can take a few months to wear off and obviously an IUD or progesterone implant would need to be removed, but the pill can be stopped any time and fertility returns immediately, so don't stop until you are really ready."
828,"Think of it like training wheels. At first you catch them,but eventually you have to let them fall and scrape their knee.

But if you let them fall over and over because you're too lazy to put down your beer that'd be bad.

It can be hard to tell where to draw the line.timing is super important.the point isn't to never help,but if you help too much you can prevent them from developing skills they need"
829,"Well, if you stay with her you will be dead withing a few years...."
830,"Yeah, using me as a tool for their fantasy or whatever it is really pissed me off. I'd kinda like to give her a piece of my mind now, but it would be best to just break it off. No sense in making that complicated by explaining all this to her. "
831,"Leave her alone. You've written 1,000 words here, but it just reads as a description of months of completely normal interactions between two human beings. The texting back and forth was probably just friendliness/politeness toward her employer's family. Even if she is mildly attracted to you, she clearly values her job more. Maybe text ""Sorry, I realise I've put you in an awkward situation. I don't expect anything more from you than looking after my sister, and if you feel comfortable with it I hope we can be friends again."" Then let her get on with it."
832,I think they were hoping you would grow out of it when you grew older. 14 year you were just a teen doing her thing but at 19 they're probably getting more and more worried you're going to let your fandoms define you perpetually even as an adult. When people see you they see a Harley fangirl first. Some might see who you are but others might never get over the first impression. I guess it alarms them that you're growing to be an adult with seemingly no individual personality showing up. If you're using Harley as a shield to hide yourself or as a confident prop to head out in the world then it might do you good to find yourself with a therapist.
833,"&gt; because there is no lease and he doesn't particularly like her.

even with no written lease, she is still a tenant and he would have to go through the whole legal eviction process to get rid of her (assuming you are in the US or a similar country), or if your tenancy is month-to-month then he would have to give her notice and it would take a least a month before she has to leave"
834,"She does have a choice, but it's very, painfully obvious that she is hoping that by sticking around she will change your mind. 

If you care about her at all, end it. That is the only way she will get it through her mind that you don't want to date her. You're not forcing her to come over it holding her against her will, but by allowing this to go on you are giving her hope. You've been perfectly clear, but she is not being honest with you about her expectations and desires. She's thinking you might not be being honest with her either. That's allowing her to hope. 

Knowing this, if you continue, you are being an asshole and using her. Just FUCKING end it."
835,I think she has a crush on you.
836,"That is obvious, of course. What I'm saying is, if she had had the opportunity, she might have wanted to talk to me. Who's to say she wasn't on her way for that, for instance. She might have wanted to take a decision after being calmer and listening to more input than follow a declaration thrown in jest.

That's at least a possibility, that I would have been an asshole to ignore if, for instance, she had just refused to talk to me for a day. Which is what happened.

I think that's a reason why I feel uneasy. That doesn't erase the fact that she might have already had taken her final decision, nor that this is all too late now.

&gt; and consider the relationship over. If she wakes up and wants you back, she'll find you, but you need to stop attempting to contact her and her family.

I have stopped because I have understood it's futile. That's essentially what I'm doing now."
837,"NONE OF THIS MAKES ANY DIFFERENCE.

These are just excuses for being a sick fuck up."
838,"I'm not sure I'd call ""Drink enough water before working out"" a fad nutrition protocol. Like any health professional is going to have the same advice here: Girl needs to drink more water."
839,"I cannot imagine a scenario where something bothered me and I couldn't talk to my best friend about it.  I also can't imagine a scenario where if I brought up an issue my best friend wouldn't help me out with it.  I would actually urge you to take a step back and look at your friendship objectively.  For instance, who initiates most contact.  If you were to stop, would she ask you why?

Perhaps it's just me, but I don't see her acting in a very best friendly manner."
840,"This might be an unpopular opinion, but you two are at such different stages of life that I don't think you should pursue this. She is in her mid 20s and is a mother. You aren't even old enough to drink yet, assuming you are in the US. You aren't even the same age as she was when she became a mother in the first place."
841,She doesn't need to delve into why she doesn't like anal. She can try to rebuild the trust now and worry about that later.
842,"I never said anything about consent or him not stopping. So I'm not sure why you're saying this. Does he get points for that or something?

She told him she didn't want or like anal sex. He kept asking. That's rude. I'm not calling him a rapist for fucksake. I'm just saying it's rude, selfish, and disrespectful. 

Hopefully he has learned that pestering people for your own pleasure is a bad idea. 

Hopefully she's learned that her own boundaries are more important that his pleasure. 

"
843,"Op actually said in a comment he doubled his debt over the past year, so he's not actually paying it off, he is actively increasing it."
844,Agreed! Especially infant twins. /u/tossedawayq122 your children found you and that is amazing!!
845,"&gt; you have never been super nice or maybe even flirtatious for someone you internally hate?

Uh, no? Especially not flirtatious??? How does that help anything?"
846,"I had a mediocre looking boyfriend once who was terribly insulted if I ever compared his looks to anyone less than Brad Pitt. He honestly thought he was the hottest dude ever. He very much was not.

Mac is hot, yes, but your bf obviously thinks he's better looking. He has an ego problem. Probably some narcissism."
847,"You need to talk to a lawyer and get out of this relationship. Your husband needs counselling, but for now you need to secure your future for you and your child. If your husband gets help and he can prove himself to you, then maybe you can get back together... but for now find out your legal legs and get out! R/legaladvice will be a good starting point. 

Religious belief is not a reason to stay in a destructive marriage. Trust me when I say that God does not want you to be destitute just to be with your husband. Making healthy choices for yourself is the most important thing right now. "
848,That would be an incredibly shitty move for you and the sister to do. 
849,"I've got a well bred Crested myself, and she works as a farm dog. Swims in the ponds, ""herds"" the goats, puts the guardian dogs in their place. She's found lost and stuck goat kids, alerted me to snakes, and she once saved me from serious harm by an angry steer. 

Not to mention she has wiped out the rodent population in our hay barn. She's certainly no ""froo-froo"" dog!

However, mine has more energy than some of the Border Collies on the place, that's for sure. "
850,"Are they the sort of people who will get your children baptized behind your back and without your approval? Because it happens.

Hard-core religious people think you are going to hell if you don't toe the religious line. That is so terrible and threatening to them that they will justify any behavior that might make you return to the fold. Most major religions actually advocate casting out or disowning a disobedient child. If they think their behavior is influencing you they will continue it hoping for more. Be a rock from the start. Be clear that this is not open for discussion, that you will have to agree to disagree. Then leave or block communication when they persist. Consider doing a search on r/atheism for people who faced what you are facing. You might find some tips on how to cope."
851,"You're being so completely blind here. Your husband is never going to change. It's not going to get better. He will continue to cheat and treat you like garbage. He doesn't value you. And someday when you have kids, he won't value them either and it will be even harder to leave his sorry abusive ass. "
852,"Well, I cried off and on for a day from the shock of it.  I was created in a doctor's office using donor sperm.  Once the tears dried, I moved on.

I suggest the DNA sites only if OP doesn't want to actively contact the daughter, but wants to be available if she finds out and wants to make contact.

I found out two ways through Ancestry.  First, I wasn't a match to my older half sister, but I was matched with two first cousins I've never heard of.  On 23&amp;me, there weren't any close matches either way."
853,"This. These are solid numbers, assuming you do not elope or go for a simple wedding involving minimal planning or fuss. Even reducing the planning window to marry at 29, you're still looking at gaps and pauses. 

Biological fertility is a real issue when a woman starts to hit around 30, and that's assuming she has no pre-existing difficulties that might impact her ability to conceive a child. You may feel like you are rushing through this, but a healthy window for conception runs 18-35 for most women."

858,We actually did this! He fell asleep so we painted his paw with tempera and tried to get it on a bristol board. Unfortunately he has so much hair between his pads that it came out pretty mangled looking (read: more like a Rorschach test) but it's the thought that counts :)
859,"The answer is easy. Quit sleeping with your housemate and quit stirring the shit. Seriously, you're an adult. You can control yourself."
860,"You NEED to live on your own and if it breaks up the two of you, so be it, it wasn't meant to be. I think your feelings are totally reasonable, and frankly, I would have kicked is ass out long before I got in the hole financially. Just tell him ""I want to live on my own, by myself. Living with you was bad for me financially and it no longer feels like the right thing for me anymore. I love you and want to remain a couple, but I understand if you don't feel the same way.""

And no, really love does not conquer all, it just makes it harder to move on when we know we should."
861,"Just because of a couple instances doesn't work doesn't mean it won't work in her case.
If this happened to any of the many places I have worked at, she would at least get suspended without pay.
This is bullshit and needs to be corrected.
You can't let people get away with shit because it might not work."
862,"Honestly, I think he's scared of being angry with them? If that makes sense? I *know* he is angry, but he's been channeling it in other ways. He's been nesting SO HARD the last couple weeks, and his to-do list is nearly complete, but I do want him to just get angry at them already! They're being ridiculous."
863,"I think you need to forget about both girls right now and focus on yourself. How do you feel about sharing custody with your ex? Is it something you enjoy? Something you feel is worthwhile? Something that benefits you?

If the answer to any of those questions is yes, then you might want to consider risking your new relationship to preserve the status quo.  

If the answer is no, and you're doing this out of obligation or a fear of hurting your ex, you might want to consider ending the pet-sharing relationship, regardless of your new relationship.

Also, think about how you want things to be going forward. Do you want to ""coparent"" the pet for the rest of it's life? If not, this is probably a good time to end things. Something else to consider is how does the cat respond to all of this? Cats are notorious creatures of habit, and I wouldn't expect a cat to be very happy at being passed from house to house on a regular basis. And if the cat is not enjoying this, that is another reason to consider ending the arrangement. It's not fair for the cat to be miserable just to keep her former owner happy.

Overall, though, I think it's important you make the decision based on what YOU want to do, and what YOU are comfortable with. If you make the decision based on what someone else wants, be it the ex or the new girl, and that person turns out not to be a permanent fixture in your life, you might find yourself doubly disappointed."

866,"I'm trying so hard not to freak out over this, but I can't help thinking back to one time a few months ago where she refused to block him for a few days. It took me begging her for hours for her to do it and even then, she keeps in contact with his friends just to ask about how he's doing"
867,"The whole note on the car thing can come off as creepy/stalkerish to a teenager.  Teenage girls especially usually don't respond too well to grand gestures from boys like that outside of the movies. Just not part of cultural norms.

868,"*Nana internet hug*

I'm so sorry you had to deal with being victimized at such a young age. 

You take care and I wish you well."
869,"I think the longer you put it off, the worse potential outcomes are. Big dealbreakers and incompatibilities should be discussed early in a relationship before feelings for the other person get so intense that you want to try and make it work out despite those things. Because they will eventually catch up to you, make you feel resentful, and then you feel stuck in a relationship that can never be the right relationship for you. And if it is the wrong relationship, you have more time to spend trying to find a relationship that will keep you happy in the short term and the long term."
870,"You're a huge part of the problem. Stop bailing her out!!! As long as she knows you will pay her debt off, she'll keep racking it up.

She needs to cut up every single one of her credit cards, cancel them, and get into therapy stat.

You also need to learn when to say no. Its normal to want to help someone you love in a time of need, but by constantly bailing her out, you're almost enabling her.

This could be a deal breaker. You need to decide how much more of her horrible life decision making you're willing to put up with. At this rate, she will drag you and herself into bankruptcy."
871,"Yeah she's like ""nobody else has had a problem with this"" which either sounds like she's not dating monogamous people (which is fine if she's aware of this) or is being lied to. I cannot think of how someone can care for their SO and not care/be totally fine with them going to meet a strange guy often for sleepovers who lives hours away, hates him viciously, is possessive, toxic about how ""wah everyone is leaving me for their boyfriends"" and refuses to meet him. Like wtf??? "
872,"You lied to her by ommission about the extent of your history with E (just use fake names for gods sake) and then straight up lied about meeting her. 

You should choose. She has a boundary. Respect it by either adhering to it or breaking up with her. "
873,"Nope, not wrong.  

If you want to throw them a bone, maybe make the traditional first name a middle name, or pick another ""family"" name.  But that's up to you.

I mean, I can understand their feelings - but just because i can *understand* them doesn't mean I *agree* with them, and while i can empathize, I still think they're being childish.

You're just going to have to put your foot down. ""I am changing my name to X and I'm not going to put up with any more lectures about it.  If wanting to enjoy my own name is disrespectful, so be it."""
874,"Why should their relationship be contingent on him coming up with $500 to be in the wedding party?

I have always refused to be in wedding parties because wedding culture grosses me out. It's not personal. "
875,This little detail changes everything :\ OP is in an abusive relationship
876,"Have you straight up asked when or how this changed? If there truly hasn't been a difference in your weight since meeting, it seems weird that his attraction would be lost. 

I'm all for honesty but he was not considerate with this and you're definitely ""allowed"" to feel disgusted/uncomfortable etc. "
877,"I genuinely don't know. Yes, I have decided to let it be. My husband said he'd try to get to the bottom of it. Thank you for your reply! "
878,"She's 17, she's a minor, she doesn't get to make that decision. She needs her mental health to be evaluated, even against her will. TBH if the prosecutions go ahead, that'll probably happen anyway."
879,Let them blow their own worlds up. It's not your problem.
880,"I actually disagree with you here. Due to my line of work I've seen a lot of naked people of various weights and ages. One thing I've noticed is that if you are larger you tend to have less hallmarks of age. Less sagging, fewer wrinkles, skin that looks more pliable. This may be partly due to less sun damage as larger people tend not to expose as much skin to the sun, it may be due to something else, but it is a trend I've noticed in my years of working in healthcare.

883,"This. My narcissistic ex-boyfriend didn't *forbid*  me to have cats, but somehow they ended up disappearing. We didn't have pets for a few years, but part of my recovery (I ended up in therapy) was getting a cat and then a dog, then finally moving out with my pets. 

It wasn't that he was cruel or mistreated them, but they were a distraction from *him*--he didn't like sharing my attention.

I agree with the 'chipping away' analysis."
884,Ambition and a wage gap aren't necessarily the same thing. Never really heard someone describe teachers as lacking in ambition lol . 
885,"Well, it's ""our money"" and also ""our debt"" - which means, IMO, the responsible thing is to put the vast majority of that return towards their debt. "
886,"And even if it weren't incorrect, it's his damn phone."
887,"Well he could say his hobby is cheating but that doesn't make it okay. His ""hobby"" violates your boundaries within a relationship. Tell him that and tell him that if he continues to violate your boundaries then you are going to leave."
888,It doesn't take long to make a duplicate key.  I could probably go out and duplicate one of my house keys in less than 20 minutes.
889,"So, what you're saying is, you were attracted to someone physically and decided to pursue her because of that attraction. Then, you got to know her better through dating her, and now really like her.  Is that right?"
890,"I've been a victim of domestic violence and stalking after I dumped him. From my own experience, in-person support groups, online support groups, and people asking for help and advice here: The chances of her getting into legal trouble are super low in the United States. Most abusers receive a slap on the wrist at best. Don't be afraid to contact the police, it won't ruin her life. It's important to protect yourself. 

Also, don't take this as ""it's useless to ask for help,"" as that's not the case, not what I'm trying to say. Just that justice for victims isn't guaranteed. Cops don't automatically side with the woman, either. It's best to extricate yourself so that you run a lower risk of having to deal with the cops (if he stays with her "" She also threatened to tell the police I physically hit her,"" his future isn't going to be uncomplicated)."
891,"Speaking from experience, not always. But usually."
892,"Pieces of trash can come in all sorts of packages. He may seem like an otherwise nice and great guy, but there's obviously something ugly under the surface. 

&gt;  We didn't have sex for the entirety of June and July, which I believe is long enough time to get cleared for everything

Not true, what if he contracted something permanent? He knowingly put you at risk so that he wouldn't have to confront the truth. 

&gt; I was going through tough times as well, but I didn't cheat on him.

You can make excuses for him all day long, but this is the bottom line. Things were bad, but he had complete control and easily could have not done this shitty thing. 

Relationships ebb and flow and if you intend to marry him and spend the rest of your life together, you're probably going to hit another rough patch where you're both crabby and stressed. That's pretty normal. There's reason to believe he'd revert to the same shitty coping mechanism that he did the first time- cheat on you. 

You seem like a great friend and a kind person, completely undeserving of this. If you don't want to make your mind up yet, at least go spend the night with a friend, maybe the one who is also going through a cheating SO. I think she'd be a good person for you to talk to right now. Don't stick around your fiance and let him try to make excuses and sweettalk you. "
893,"First, I want to say how strong you've been through this. 

It's time to discuss this with your wife. She is your rock, your support, and you need to let yourself be supported. She can help you decide what to discuss with your children. I personally would leave how you became pregnant out until they are older, but discuss with them about how young you were and how you were too young to be a mom. If they ask questions, answer them honestly but feel free to water things down for now.

It would be best for your sister to know about the email, but this is ultimately up to you to share. 

If you would like an example of starting this dialogue with your wife:

""Hun, I need to talk to you about something. Remember how I've been sad for a few days? Something came up and reminded me of this awful thing that happened to me when I was young."" go on to tell her what you are comfortable with her knowing, including the pregnancy and adoption. Finish with talking about the email and asking advice about what to tell the children."
894,"Sounds to me like he wants normalcy and doesn't want to dwell on his illness.

Do your best to give him normalcy."
895,The fact that she sees something so petty like this as a dealbreaker is an example to me of how immature she must be. She should have enough respect for you to have your own privacy. If she has this attitude about something so small imagine what she would be like further down the line if you stay with her. 
896,You should plan ahead better if you ever plan to live with someone again. People have rights in this country even when you are justified in being upset with them. Six months is pretty quick to be living together let alone for one person to be paying for everything; maybe take things slower as far as financially supporting someone in the future. 
897,Ask him why he wasnt answering his phone. If that doesnt get you anywhere find out if his brother has a thing for you.
898,"He's definitely hiding something and using this situation to deflect.

2. The ban has been upheld to *not* include legal green card and visa holders. She'll be able to come back in."
901,"It's really, really good that you're not actually married."
902,"Then just be civil. Explain to them calmly, without profanity, exactly how deeply betrayed you feel. Make them realize that your opinion of is permanently changed. Do this in person. I suspect that they feel guilty about their actions. So, if you keep calm they will be force to confront their own shittiness. If you get mad or get revenge you only give the a way out of confronting their actions.

Only you can decide what your relationship going forward will entail. That being said, their actions seem intentional and unnecessary, i.e. real shitty. Shitty people are not worth wasting energy over. Your brother actions appear, on the face, to be the most egregious. You really need to question whether these are people you want in you life. You will only have deal with them for a limited amount of time. If you feel the need to completely ignore and avoid them, then that is ok so long as you do it after you have told them how you feel. Whatever you do, let them know what your position is.

Be Civil. Stay Calm. But, do you. "

904,"To be fair, we now live in a new house we bought together, so it is now ""our"" house completely, but initially, yes, he did move into my apartment I had before.

905,"He's not talking about a normal summer camp. There are some pretty abusive camps for 'troubled' teens that start with a middle of the night, parentally sanctioned abduction to establish the power dynamic and keep the kid from having a chance to protest. You can google for more info."
906,OP is helping by nagging her husband on family's behalf. 
907,"The proposal is not just the man's ""thing."" There should be an open, honest discussion about it between the two of them.  They're both entering into the marriage, and they should each know where the other stands.

 She's given him ample time and he just keeps coming back with these bullshit excuses. If he was honest with her from the beginning she wouldn't keep asking him about it. They're not all that young, so if they want children it's kind of getting to the point where they need to get their shit together. "
908,"OK so you want to be treated with respect and you want to not go on this camp. Right so this is what you need to do:

1. Get that keylogger off that computer. It doesn't help your case at all, and if your parents find out, they will explode, and rightly so. You want respect and privacy, you need to take that step.

2. Sit down with your parents and suggest some alternatives. They believe you have a problem, you need to convince them that you don't and to do that you are going to have to be reasonable. Go back to therapy, and remain calm the whole time. Kicking up a fuss doesn't help your case.

3. Accept that you are a minor and that your parents can make decisions for you. Which means you may be unable to convince them. In which case you are going to have to seriously think about why this is happening. We often have very little insight into ourselves and our behaviour and that means that if your behaviour is unacceptable, ypu might be the last one to notice."
909,"Yes - he works. He's gone about 9 hours a day, Monday through Friday. I work from home. Our income is close enough that I would say we make the same amount of money. 

He probably goes on Facebook at work too, but I am... you know, actually WORKING throughout the day and don't have the desire to monitor his activity. I'm not his mom.

And I will repost in r/mentalhealth. Thank you for that suggestion."
