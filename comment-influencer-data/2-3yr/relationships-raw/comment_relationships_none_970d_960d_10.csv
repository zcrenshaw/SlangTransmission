0,"Stepping back from 'living together in a committed relationship' to 'lease is up - open relationship' sounds a lot like he's telling you he wants to break up, but still wants your half of the rent until the contract dissolves. Don't do it. This compromise will not make you happy."
1,"If he got fit and grew a beard then the physical change is a lot less worrying!

I went to a college where cocaine use was pretty common. I was always a fairly light user, but a lot of my friends did a lot more than I did and the vast majority of them never developed addictions. I *have* known coke addicts, I'm absolutely not going to say it isn't a risk because it totally is, but I have known far more casual users. "
2,"The people saying there's no such thing as a casual user are honestly completely full of shit. They're either as sheltered as you admittedly are, or have just had bad luck with their group of friends and the way they reacted to the drug. Source: me and most of my friends are, or have been at some point, casual (i.e. like 5-10 times a year) users. We all graduated university, we all make close to or above six figures.

Ergo, point proven, casual use exists."
3,"If they had not been merely casual friends, they would have known your relationship with your aunt. No one. Absolutely no one has 50 close friends. You have maybe 3-7 close friends. The rest are acquaintances or less."
4,This is what I got from this as well.
5,"Because they don't want you to contact them, whether you've tried to or not."
6,"I'm inclined to believe this given my experience of living in a haunted bedroom and based on her actions lately - my 1st thought reading your post was a ghost.

Her actions will not go away until you move out - trust me. She is going to feel scared if not terrified 24/7 until you leave."
7,Wow. Please add that to your post. This explains why your wife kind of hates you right now.
8,"""Barista"" is Millennial for ""I worked at a coffee shop."" 

Now if you'll excuse me I have some kids that need to get off my lawn..."

10,I generally avoid going on dates that require me to decrypt the invitation.
11,"Aand in this case it might not help anyway, since OP's husband stated flat out that he got different soup because he thought it would taste better.  So even if she says why she needs something, there's no guarantee he won't just decide differently."
12,"&gt; I feel like maybe if I wouldn't have been as friendly and nice to them or maybe a skirt I wore was short or a low sweater, I don't know it just feels like it's my fault. 

People might even imply or outright state that it's your fault or that you encouraged it by being to casual with them, but it's not. These are young guys, they need to be taught that you don't interact with people like that. If they were harassing their classmates like that the school would do something. The fact that it's a teacher on the receiving end doesn't make their behaviour any less inappropriate. Honestly, it's better for them to learn it now than to grow into frat boys who believe the whole 'no means yes' culture. So if reporting it makes you feel uncomfortable or embarrassed, maybe it will help you tell yourself that you're really doing them a favour by making sure they learn appropriate boundaries when they're young."
13,"I completely understand your reasons for changing your last name, and I would mover forward with it. But when it comes up in conversation with your dad I would downplay the 'be your own man' aspect and play up 'I don't want to carry a racist legacy with me forever' part. Maybe emphasize how if there wasn't that history you'd be honored to share his name.
  
If it's true, you could mention that in a perfect world you would all change your name together, but you know that it's unreasonable and you would never ask that of your family, so going your own way is the only reasonable choice.
  
So, do it anyway. He may be upset, but I'm sure he'll come around, and it's your life."
14,"You are awesome, OP! Sorry you had to go through this bs with him though. :/

My go-to boys for heartbreak were always Ben&amp;Jerry and Ernest&amp;Julio. Mint Aero sounds good too."
15,"Hello, my new soulmate!"
16,"Fuck, I literally gasped out loud when I read that he tried to *push you out of the car while you were driving*. He could have *killed* you. He *tried* to kill you. The issue here isn't the difference between a boyfriend/husband relationship, it's that you are finding it difficult to fully commit to someone who *could have killed you*.

You are never going to be able to trust this man again, married or not. He's in counselling and has made improvements, which, great! But I think that this relationship will never be right for you again after all this. You will never feel truly safe around him again, and you will always have at least a small pocket of fear/anger/resentment towards him for what he did to you. You need to leave him.

**Edit:** Also, a favourite saying I have is 'Drunk actions, sober thoughts'. When I get drunk I tend to talk over people and hog the spotlight, which is an exaggeration of negative traits I try to control during my sober life. I have a tendency to seek attention, and often need to consciously stop myself, which I can't do as well when I'm drunk. Your boyfriend's drunk behaviour is a reflection of his less filtered, more distilled personality. If he tried to kill you while drunk, what do you think he thinks of you when he's sober? How many times has he wanted to do what he did when he was drunk? That's terrifying, that shows a scary hatred of you and complete lack of respect. What you do drunk is often what you *want* to do sober.

You don't just snap and become a different person when you're drunk."
17,"Here's the thing tho, he's not a child. She stated he leaves the chip clip things all over the house, so obviously he has a little trouble not picking up after himself. Do you enjoy picking up after grown men or women? As a grown man he should be fully capable of putting chip clips away or his dirty laundry, but he doesn't. So if he wants to act like a child I guess she has to treat him as such. So if he doesn't like her to ask him to do things that a normal adult would do on their own, perhaps he should adjust his own mentality and grow up. He can't have it both ways, he can't act like a child and be treated like a grown up,. "
18,"I understand what you mean about sex with clothes on being hot but the hotness does wear off when it's every time lol. He's been ""making love"" to me with candles lit and everything while I have to stare at Yoda on his shirt 😧"
19,It feels better to have an understanding of the situation rather than just being forbidden to do something. Good for you for seeing a different perspective. 
20,"Whether homosexual, bisexual, heterosexual, asexual, transsexual... if you're not compatible sexually, there is no fault in parting ways. "
21,"On some level you do matter to her.  But you're NEVER going to have a satisfying sexual relationship with her.  It's who she is, there's no waiting for her to change.  She's not bad, probably should have been more up front with this information, but things have played out the way they have.

You have to decide if not having sex is what you want in you relationship.

Sorry. "
22,OP should also change her number in his phone. Possibly to one of those fake dump them phone numbers. 
23,"We grew up really poor and my mom towed the line you're talking about here and you know what? She put us and herself in a lot of really dangerous and quite frankly, fucked up situations. I see what you're trying to say here but the reality of the situation is that people don't end up homeless because they're good at assessing risk and making decisions. A lot of the times it's substance abuse or mental illness or a mix of both that land them there and generally speaking, neither of those groups are safe people to have your kids around. It doesn't mean they're malicious or undeserving of help or compassion but people don't always have to ""mean it"" to cause others real harm. OP is right to be concerned and if her husband wants to offer help and support to these people there are plenty of ways that he can do so, even involve his children, that don't require that he puts them at risk like he's doing now. "
24,"If it were me? I would abandon ship. You do what's best for you though, man. "
25,"Suit,  bow tie and a fez... Is your son ""The Doctor"" and if so can I be his friend. Haha
Also most kids don't give a damn. What they wear at his age. I honestly believe, given how self aware your kid is , his IQ must be very high. Nurture that. Kids a potential genius. Could have the world falling at his feet and when it does. Ask him can I have a job ?  "
26,I'm not understanding the sequence of events here at all. He'll try to have sex and you turn him down because of performance issues? 
27,"&gt; I've been told being underweight makes me a ""novelty fuck.""

Wow. That is some kind of bullshit. People are *so* unkind to underweight women. I'm sorry."
28,"I hope you sorted out the payment. But I'd just like to point out cupcakes are even more unreasonable, seriously. Just bake 2-3 regular cakes and be done with it, fuck hand icing 150 cakes for free."
29,"You seem condescending and egotistical, so I hope this girl comes to her senses and stops trying to reconcile with you. Or you do it for the both of you. "
30,You already know your husband is a liar so why do you believe him about this?  He is clearly cheating. 
31,You've enabled him unfortunately. He won't change unless it's for himself and he certainly won't change for you. Cut your losses and dump him now 
32,"My husband's initial reaction would have been ""what can we do to help her"" not ""well there might be some way what he said was justifiable."" If it was somebody he knew really well then I could see some disbelief, but if I told him I'd seen texts from the guy verbally abusing her and threatening to rape her, he might need some time to adjust to this new view of his friend but he sure as hell wouldn't give the guy her location.

If he did what your husband did, I'd leave him too. Apologies and explanations after he'd finally seen proof he couldn't ignore? Fuck that shit. Too late.

You might also want to find out (from a lawyer) if your husband might possibly be charged with endangerment or something similar."
33,Seriously I agree. Have a nice night out and talk and go see a movie. 
34,[removed]
35,You and your husband could switch rooms with him? 
36,"I know I'm not either of you, but I think a proposal idea from strangers who know nothing about the two of you is not the way to go. You know her better than us, whether she would want it to be public or private. How romantic or short it needs to be. Tall to her about what she wants. You should be able to come up with something good on your own."
37,"Its not about her! Does it really matter where she sits/stands at the wedding?  I would absolutely not be creating any type of special role for her, no way. Nope. "
38,"This is a trap. It will kill you in the long run, maybe sooner than later.

Quit. 

Get a credit card if you can and worry about paying it off later. Your parents' funds shouldn't affect your financial aid at this age, but honestly, if you need to drop out of school and go live in a shelter, do it. Your life is literally at stake here."

40,"Don't make any sudden decisions for the time being. You've had two sudden, traumatic, painful experiences in quick succession and you're not in a good place psychologically. So first thing, go check in for your psychiatric treatment and commit whole-heartedly to that program and to getting stable. 

After you are discharged from inpatient treatment, I'm assuming there is no problem with you continuing to stay in the family home with your siblings and you have good relationships with them? So just move there for the time being. Have your siblings or some friends go over to the apartment and bring your clothes and the basic stuff that you need, maybe clean out the fridge and freezer, shut off the utilities etc but not necessarily pack the whole place up yet. Then just don't rush yourself, see how you feel as time goes on. You have plenty of options. Maybe a few months from now you'll feel able to go back and live in the apartment. 

If a few months pass and you still don't want to go back, you can pack the place up and rent it out, and use that income to help pay bills while staying in your family home, or use the rent money to rent yourself another apartment that can feel like a fresh start. When and if you are ready you can think about selling the place, but right now you don't need to panic or make snap decisions. 

The apartment is fine for now and you have a safe alternative place to stay for as long as you need it. Breathe. Nothing is urgent except your need to take care of yourself."
41,"&gt;How do I tell her this and sound sincere?

You don't. 

If you say ""Baby, I just want you to know I'm actually really turned on by [ legs of a particular shape ]"" then what she'll hear is ""So I'm not even a person to you, just a pair of legs? You're not interested in me or what I like or how I feel, you're just turned on by a part of my body?!""

Be nice to *her*, as a person. Do not bring up the topic of her legs. If she brings up the topic, just smile and try not to look too lecherous. 

Later, after you've been dating for a *long while*, you can mention that you're into a particular shape of leg, once you both feel safe &amp; comfortable around each other. But you're not there yet, so for now, just smile and be supportive. "
42,"It's a sad day when we don't value the absence of bigotry against people, but instead value the social skills necessary to conceal it."
43,"If he tells her about his leg fetish, she'll probably think her legs are the only reason he's dating her
"
44,"She didn't just complain to her family, she also outright told him as an insult during heated arguments that her family hated him.

If he's going to be a part of her life long term and ultimately a PART of her family (which clearly ain't happening), presumably she'd be concerned with making them like him--not painting him as a bad person in their eyes and encouraging them to dislike him.

It sounds like it she treated him poorly and he got out, which he should have. Hopefully he finds someone who treats him well."
45,YES!! That is SO tacky and beyond RUDE! Its like those people who propose to others at other peoples actual wedding. It isn't cute just tacky and raunchy
46,"Honestly, I don't think ""mature"" or ""immature"" matters very much in this case, but I respect your concern for when you separate. Does your school have any kind of counselor apart from a guidance counselor? Any super-sensitive or -kind teachers that you know of (especially if he has them)?

It sounds like you're his main support system, so you should work to help him get other supports in place. Also encourage him to make friends. Does he enjoy any activities? Would he join a team or club?"
47,"A lot of grandparents WANT TO support their grandchildren. That's not ""bailing you out"". But you need to tell them so they can plan and help you plan, too. 


How would you not tell them? Are you completely independent from them? Where do you and the child's mother plan on living when the kid is born? Where will the kid live?"
48,It's very much like a religion. You won't unconvert them.
49,"True, but (in my experience) it doesn't say what it was. 

So, yeah, I spent $40 at Bed Bath and Beyond on a blender, but all my bank website says is ""$40 BBB"" and crazy roommate could go ""I bought this blender for $60 at Target!"" "
50,"No, of course not, but that's not what OP's asking, nor what everyone's discussing."
51,"You apologize for lying. As long as you live under their roof, you gotta go by their rules. Otherwise, they can make your life pretty miserable. You've got less than 2 years left before you're legally an adult, and even then, it's still their rules as long as you live under their roof. Don't want to follow their rules? Focus on making a plan to move out when you're 18."
52,"UGH I'm a woman who was in a similar company for years right out of college. I was paid full commission because I ""ran my own business"" yet I was always broke despite working ~70 hours, 6-7 days a week. The cult aspect was so real, they crafted a personality cult around a few of the people who truly ""made it"" and you had to perfectly emulate their actions (constant work hours, all of which I'm sure were exaggerated). I actually made great friends there, which made working 14 hours a day somewhat fun. We drank beer in the office at night like our own little frat! A lot of the guys got into strippers and gambling, therefore needing to make more money. We were also encouraged to get into credit card debt (fake it til you make it) so that we had EXTRA incentive to work harder. 

Finally after 4 years of devoting my life to something that wasn't working for me, I decided I was over the Kool-Aid. The promise that if I did XYZ I was guaranteed to make six figures became an obvious lie. The real problem with these cults is that some people actually DO make it and that's enough to keep everyone else grasping onto their sinking ship. I quit June 2016 after landing my dream job and it's still haunting me. The company decided to come after me for money that I allegedly owe them. Turns out they have tried to get blood from the stone of every person who has left.

Like your GF's company, this is all regulated by the government and is technically legit. My BF works in financial compliance and he knew all along that my company was shit and I was doomed to fail. But, as other comments have said, if you tell her that she will dig her heels in so much harder. They have culty pep talks at these companies about what to do when no one supports you, be it SO or family, and the resounding answer is ""Once you make it, your SO will be eating their words!""

If you want to keep your relationship, you have to let it play out. And when she comes to you completely broken that she has sunken money, time, and relationships for years you need to support her and hold back any ""I told you so's."" Feel free to message me if you want to hear more, I feel for you guys so much. When I left it really felt like I had woken up in a cult and needed to call my daddy for a rescue mission airlift home."
53,"&gt; we tease each other frequently, but never cross the boundaries.

You may actually be regularly hitting sore spots but he keeps that hidden to go along with the game. 

My husband and I play like this but we also agree we can't blame the other if a barb hurts worse than expected. If it's very painful we speak up but don't accuse."
54,"If the mother always stunk of booze, and there were bottles strewn about with an always-screeching kid, that'd be grounds to call CPS, wouldn't it?

Same principle."
55,I would say it is better to cut your losses while you can and bail. She has hit the wall and clearly just likes the attention of a younger man. Do yourself a favour and find someone that deserves you and your feelings.
56,"Go to her immediately and apologize.  Tell her you care.  Ask her directly if shes planning to kill herself.  If she says yes do not leave her alone.  Break down the door if you have to.  Call the suicide hotline as needed.1-800-273-8255 

Tomorrow please tell a trusted teacher what happened."
57,"It may be a first world problem, but she has third world habits.

It's disgusting and potentially harmful to her family.

Tell her and don't take no for an answer (otherwise she can cook for herself)."
58,"You're right, this is a bad idea. Absolute best case scenario, you guys stay together forever and grow old together with each other's names on your faces. I don't know what line of work you're in / want to get into but outside of a very few select career options I guarantee this will limit your career growth, to say nothing of the inevitable stares you will get from strangers, especially when the two of you are out in public together.

zahcncam's suggestion isn't a bad compromise. "
59,"Yes, but at what point do you decide to quit?"
60," This a thosand times this.""He just skipped asking you to not hang out with guy friends and just went for the ""Your family members are taking you away from me"". run as fast as you can."
61,OP said in another comment he's already been physical with another man so it goes beyond crushes IMO. 
62,"""Fuck off, I've held crayons that are bigger"".

I am stealing that one."
63,"With one income, you are in a financial situation where all of your money is joint money and all financial decisions are joint decisions. That can work for some people, but the recent conflict has shown your wife that it doesn't work for her anymore. So she wants to create a financial situation where she has money she completely controls, first by selling her things and then by getting a job. It's totally reasonable, and if you hammer joint and individual finances out properly, it gives you money of your own, as well. And that is just one of many benefits of her having a job."
64,"When I suggested that she should date women while still in the marriage, she rejected it. She says it doesn't feel right to her and feels too much like cheating, even if it is with my blessing.

We have discussed exploring together in the past but it has never materialized and at this point, I doubt it will, for reasons I cannot put into words.

I owe a lot of the good things in my life to this woman and am having a very hard time on accepting an image of my world without her in it. Very much so, to the degree that I am willing to forego some of my own needs in order to see hers fulfilled.
It seems like the right things to do to me, for the big picture. The long run."
65,"Actually I was approached by a legit photographer over Facebook (been following him on social media for years) to be his model. I asked if I can bring my bf and he too said no. But the point is, he takes mostly nudes. He also gave me the same reason as the shady guy above. I was ecstatic that he wanted to work with me but his refusal for me to bring my bf is really unsettling for me so I rejected. "
66,I loathe anti-vaxxers so much for their dangerous willful stupidity that I'd probably keep the baby from them at least a full year. 
67,[deleted]
68,"&gt; Is there anything I can do to prevent others outside the group from dragging the rest through the mud, though? A single rumor can really hurt us, I think.

All these vague references makes me think your group is a revolutionary terror outfit."
69,[deleted]
70,"&gt;I don't know if the police can do anything, he didn't actually physically hurt me

If you ask him to leave your property and he doesn't, that's trespassing. The trick is when you call the cops don't tell them ""my father is harassing me and won't leave"" tell them ""there is a man in my yard and he won't leave and he's frightening me"","
71,"&gt; hey friend, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but she's cheating on you -- emotionally at least, and maybe more.

Given the nature of the messages:

&gt; the messages on multiple occasions have him going to her work to see her and him asking her if he can come pick her up.

It's practically a certainty that there was physical infidelity here."
72,"if OP had this medical condition, likely everyone at the wedding will know.  they could also put a cute note in the program"
73,"This and other similar comments that you've made concern me a bit because they remind me of myself with my starter husband several years ago. It seems that so much of your identity and ability to be happy is tied up in this guy . . . and that's not a good thing. To you, it's just a sign of how much you love him, but it really is not. There's a lot of flowery shit out there about how the 'right person' completes you, but that isn't true. The right person doesn't complete you. You should be whole BEFORE you meet them, not missing something or empty. The same goes for the other person. Otherwise you start having issues with codependency and such - it just spirals into more problems. 

I just get this feeling that you've wrapped up so much of your identity in him that it's damaging to you, and since he already left once to go sew his wild oats, what's going to happen to you if he decides to do it again? And again? What about any other time he lets you down or you're left doubting? And it certainly doesn't sound like he's putting in the emotional work to reassure you, which is NECESSARY to heal this. Yes, you were on a break, no, it wasn't cheating - but clearly it will lead to issues you need to work through and he needs to provide support for. That makes it even more concerning that you *need* him for that validation, since he isn't providing it.

I am probably projecting a bit, but - it's hard to explain, but once you've had both that type of relationship AND one where you have come into it feeling confident in who you are and complete as an individual, it's painfully obvious how different it is. "
74,You believe going to a couple court dates would be more painful to a baby than having her father help raise her? He has guts to feed you that line. Most people would have just laughed at that pitiful excuse to ditch his baby. I wonder what the real reason was.
75,"No, you're thinking of a goldigger, which you are not. You ARE a huge moocher though "
76,"If you have a bowl of soup with a giant turd floating in the middle do you say ""I hate that people keep pointing out the poop, I'm fine with just *eating around it*""?"
77,"Confront management at the local of office or escalating? If it is a local level, it is pointless they know and they don't care, if he goes remote he will probably get someone fired. And [I already said what I think about that](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5nsq0f/coworkers_are_starting_to_envy_my_situation_and/dcegcyv/)."
78,"I mean, in an open relationship it's still good to tell people you might be doing stuff with that you're in a relationship yourself. "
79,"It isn't psycho. She was paranoid and asked him about it and he was gaslighting. So for her own sanity she wanted to see if she really was being crazy or if he was lying. Her instincts were correct.

He probably found the GPS tracker AFTER the accusatory phone conversation. I bet he certainly didn't know about it beforehand. If dinner at 1 was no big deal, why lie? Why say you're at work? "
80,"Lol,his ""conflicting emotions"" and ""inner turnoil""?? Really? He kept the fact he had a serious 8-year relationship from her, got handsy, talked about sexual things, then asked her not to tell anyone what happened, that's not an accident. 

Who cares if he is even having doubts? Being attracted to someone and having doubts are not justifications for this shady behavior. "
81,Uh Muslims believe in Jesus. Your grandma is clearly racist. It's time to start drawing boundaries - I'm glad your mom seems to be understanding at least. 
82,"As a person ages they, in theory, should gain compassion. Find ways to use the things they have learned from living in the world to treat a wider range of people with compassion.

You probably feel weak because you've had your mind, body and spirit systematically undermined, weakened and destroyed by a person you thought loved you. Help yourself, please OP; the first step on the road to recovery is learning how to love yourself again and seeing you have more worth than what your abusive ass of an ex is telling you.

People do care about you, this person (I refuse to call him a man because he doesn't deserve it) does not care about you. Figure out who does and find ways to lean on them."
83,"You learn from your mistakes in your next relationship because she'd be an idiot herself to forgive you.  A few things:
* You are too old to not understand how periods work
* You need to take more responsibility in understanding the methods of birth control that you are involved in
* You friend is, in fact, a complete idiot and you should never take dating advice from him again
* You texted and called her an insane number of times in a short period of time about this, which is totally ridiculous behavior unless someone died or is dying

On top of all of that, you were very quick to assume the worst in her and to assume that she's some misogynistic stereotype, even when it goes against things she's directly and honestly said to you.  I'd take a good, long look at how you view women, dude."
84,"Uh huh, really reaching now, huh?

Look, its pretty clear you're just looking for drama, so just break up with him because he doesn't deserve this."
85,"Ugh, I'd have a really hard time being intimate with my SO after they pulled something like this. What if her birth control someday fails? Will you immediately jump down her throat and accuse her of doing it intentionally when she needs your support the most? "
86,"I would first say ""Welcome to our universe.""  It's cold here all the time.  I hope you brought a jacket.

Best responses to shit like this?  

1.) Long, unwavering stare

2.) ""Is that REALLY what you meant to say?""

3.) ""Wanna try that again?""

4.)  Walk away

Two things that govern my life and keep me from losing it:  Never attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity, and you don't change a lifetime of ignorance with a 20 minute conversation.  People need to be aware of their own behavior, but the impetus for changing comes from inside them.  So, once you've made your feelings known, wipe your hands of it."
87,"You will get a portion of your husband's earnings as if you earned it yourself.

Let's say that after your husband's raise he'll earn 3000 and you both agree that your efforts as SAHM are worth 1000. You will contribute for 1/4 of the household's value. After paying the shared expenses, you will get 1/4 of what's left for your personal needs and personal savings.

To be honest, all this maths kills a bit all the love and joy of having a child."
88,"If that's the case, you SHOULD dump him, for his sake.  Who would want to date someone who is full of resentment and not able to move past it?"
89,"Last night I went out with 3 guys from work until 11:30. I was the only girl (none of our SOs were there). We sat around a boutique brewery trying beers and ordered Vietnamese food and talked shop.

It's work drinks. That's just what you do. "
90,Single handedly the most humorously written post on r/relationships I have read. Props bruh.
91,"I would like to add that you still don't understand birth control. It would be a good idea to get a better handle on it, as a grown man who relies on it, and also to show your gf you made the effort. 

You don't take/skip the placebo (sugar pills) pills for a month, it's more like a week, depending on your type of pills. A lot of women skip the placebo week completely and take the actual pills continuously for a few months for health reasons. There's also the type designed to take continuously for a few months before starting a placebo period. 

During the placebo week, it's also not an actual period, but rather withdrawal symptoms from not taking the pills with hormones in them. This produces symptoms that mimic a period, but you're not actually menstruating, since the medication prevents you from releasing an egg. This is why it is no big deal (and preferable) for a lot of women to take the pills with hormones in them continuously."
92,"As someone who just started recently battling severe anxiety after a lifetime of being pretty chill, it sounds like your gf is in the middle of some kind of mental breakdown related to high anxiety. Are there any other stressors happening in her life right now? 18 is a pretty eventful age...lots of changes. I'd recommend you encourage her to go to a therapist, now...or maybe attempt to talk to her mom again first and ask her mom to take her. Anxiety will make you freak out in a way that is complete disproportional to the the urgency of the situation, and logical reasoning and a pregnancy test won't fix it."

94,"I'd be *super* pissed if the person I was in a relationship with ran this by her mother before me, because then that not only blindsides me to something other people are aware of, it puts pressure on me to say yes since other people think it's a good idea. "
95,"It does suck.

And if his attitude was more along the lines of ""Man this sucks and I fucked up, how do I raise this baby right?"", then I think they're be a lot more coddling and support (at least, I would definitely have a different tone).

But so far, his attitude has been ""I don't want to tell my parents and get a lecture"" and ""I don't want my parents to help"" and basically a lot of ""me, me, me"". His baby momma is already what, 5ish months pregnant? and he's still halfway in denial and trying to spin himself as a realist when he's actually being incredibly selfish and shitty. "
96,Me. I dislike it. Makes me feel gross and it always has.
97,"So, you have two kids. Imagine 30 years from now, one of those kids is married. His wife cheats on him with a family friend, one that he has welcomed into his home and that he frequently drives her to over to hang out with alone. For years. If your son (or daughter) came to you with this situation, would you forgive the daughter-in-law (or son-in-law) and the cheating partner? Or would you feel murderous rage toward the person who betrayed your kid and their partner in the crime?

Also, speaking of the kids, are you cool with lying to your kids for decades about the affair? It is clear that your wife is going to continue seeing this guy and bringing your kids around this guy regardless of how it makes you feel. Do you want to look your kids in the face and lie to them every single day, pretending that your marriage is a good one, that the dude hasn't banged your wife on a frequent basis for a couple years, and that your wife loves you?

I understand that when you're in a crisis, you go into shock and disassociate from reality and that's what you're doing right now. Your wife has told you who she is, she is a lying cheater who is willing to use you as a ""personal sex chauffeur"" as you have said, with a complete and total disregard of your feelings and a complete lack of respect for you. In fact, in all of this, all she cares about is her public persona, that no one looks at her differently and that she can continue her ""friendship"" with her cheating partner.

Wake up. Your marriage is over. At this point, you're just a guy who happens to have feelings for his roommate.

ETA: She agreed to the counseling so you wouldn't go all over town and tell everyone that she's a cheating scumbag. She's hoping to preserve her good name and make sure the breadwinner is still covering all her expenses  while she runs around and does whatever she wants. She didn't ""come clean,"" she just wanted someone to listen to her whine about how her bf doesn't love her anymore because she was emotional about it and she didn't trust anyone else in town to keep her secret."
98,"Theft in the same house?  The police will absolutely not do anything about this.  He has always let them out when she came home, and the police aren't there to adjudicate whether the dogs really wanted to be in his room or not.

This is a civil matter with a clear path for resolution.  Start proceedings to evict him.  Lock the dogs away from him in the meantime."
99,One of my concerns is that resentment is going to fester whatever happens. The only positive is that the parents are able to make their wishes known while they are still alive so there can't be any skulduggery after they pass.

It is fair to say they may not be compatible. I wish people would stop looking for an excuse to make their partner ""wrong"" and justify a break up. ""I'm not happy with this relationship anymore"" is reason enough."
104,You should have quit while you were ahead....

106,"&gt; All of the other guys in the car are looking at me and I felt pressured so I answered quickly ""whatever, sure."" 

I think I've discovered why you ended up at the strip club.  You agreed to go.

Sorry, unless there's more than you wrote here, everyone ""looking at you"" and wanting to go themselves is **not** inappropriate social pressure.  Your boyfriend did the right thing here and asked your opinion.  You're supposed to give it truthfully, and you didn't.

Consider his post about the same event: ""Everyone wanted to go to a strip club.  I asked my girlfriend, and we agreed.  Then she chewed me out and yelled at me while we were there.  What happened?""

You don't have a leg to stand on in this argument, sorry.  Next time your partner asks you an important question, tell him the truth.   You would expect the same thing."
107,"So either some or all of them are in relationships and cheated, in which case, he may have ended up doing the same. Obviously not cool.

If he was the only member of the group who didn't sleep with hookers, he would be kind of the odd one out. Not fun.

If he is the only one of the group who has a girlfriend and they are enjoying a single guys weekend and he is watching from the sidelines, then gee, how exciting.

Any which way this situation goes sounds like the best idea was for him to stay at home with the girl who cares for him! 

His friends can fuck off."
108,"I'm very sorry that that happened to you. That's absolutely horrific, and I can understand why it would make you leery of the police. But I think it would still be in your best interest to go. Take a couple of supportive friends with you if need be, but you owe it to yourself to at least find out what sort of help they can offer you.

As for her son, yes, it would be terribly sad for him if his mother went to jail or had to be sectioned, but if she's dangerously unstable/potentially violent it could also be in his best interest. Keep that in mind."

110,"She's 260 at 5'4 now, it's time to make a life style change and you have all the right to expect that of her. You can't marry someone who's willingly living a very unhealthy lifestyle that will almost certainly affect your -and potential kids- life in the future. People should do whatever they want with their lives, but you're in no way responsible for her choices and personally I'd see it as a big middle finger that she expects you to accept this. Also I'd strongly encourage you to take action. I know fat-acceptence is trending, but you can't let your fiancee eat herself to death, just as you would take action if she was using drugs or anything else that would harm her to that extent.

I suggest you make it clear that you will help her with every step of the way, with love and support. If she's not willing to do anything about it I'd leave."
111,"yeah. I mean I am not gonna lie the temptation was there for me. She is attractive and it would have been easy to just play along with it... But I just couldn't. I have been cheated on before. Not my style

112,"Those 150K developer jobs also tend to involve 60-80 hour workweeks that are primarily on-site and cultures where taking your vacation days is seen as not being a team player.  12 weeks of vacation comes at hefty price, as does the freedom to work remotely the other 40 weeks of the year.  It is not feasable for a 24 year old woman to be able to demand 150K salary, 4-6x more vacation than typically offered, and the freedom to work remotely 100% even if she's amazing at her work. Any attempt to increase her salary is very likely to require a severe restructuring of your lifestyle. "
113,"Only a Sith deals in absolutes.

I don't think anyone would make the argument that what he did isn't scummy, but a *lot* of people would consider video chatting random girls a very mild form of cheating, if they would call it cheating at all. If someone treats it as more serious than that, that's obviously fine, but it's certainly more a matter of opinion than you're painting it as.

Furthermore, not everyone would consider cheating once enough to end every relationship every time. It is personally an automatic dealbreaker for me, but some people find they can move past infidelity depending on the circumstances. There's no piece of relationship advice that's one size fits all, and that includes reactions to cheating."
114,"Maybe he's feeling guilty about dropping the friendship over time. But you did right, don't blame yourself for being scared and confused to stop him earlier. 
Sounds like the relationship prior to this craziness wasn't that deep, so I'd suggest to just tell him that you're not interested in keep in touch with him and that you neither have the energy nor the time for the attention he seeks. If he's not a crazy person for real, he'll get the hint and drop it off."
115,"I hate to state the super obvious, but many things change when children happen, even if they were planned but especially so with unexpected pregnancies. 

You have to be ready to deal with making big sacrifices, and I worry from some of these comments that resentment is already starting to build. Have you talked to your wife about how you feel in regards to the pregnancy? What has she said in response?    "

119,"Go talk to your OB/GYN, and if you don't have one get a referral from your primary care doctor.  If you can't do that for some reason, go to Planned Parenthood. The help you're asking for is literally their primary mission. 

So about 20% of all men have some sperm in their precum under normal circumstances, and you absolutely, positively could get pregnant from ""just a few thrusts"" if he's one of them. Just as importantly: 100% of men have some sperm in their precum *if they've ejaculated recently*.  You don't get it all out, so unless he's taken a good long piss between bouts of sex, the withdrawl method is absolutely not effective in those circumstances. "
120,"You are not in the wrong!

If he openly admits to masturbating, why is it any worse when you do it?

Considering that you have a background in abuse.... If he would have walked in on you masturbating, his reaction should have been ""hell yeah"" you seem to be getting over it.

What he is doing right now, seems more like he wants to force you back into the cycle of abuse. Yeah, his abuse is not physical, but holding masturbation over your head like a weapon- not a good sign. 

While it may seem mortifying, even if he has footage of you engaging in some self loving? It may hurt you in corporate settings, but it is still way better than you getting banged by some random thug. If he got you on camera masturbating, it is his loss. You were not being unfaithful, or immoral. If he has that footage and he puts it out there, you have the advantage."

123,Lol. She already says my butt looks better than hers and she likes to squeeze it. I make sure to mention it's because of squatting.
124,"It doesn't sound like your girlfriend is unintelligent, it sounds like her areas of interest are very different than yours. 

There are many different kinds of intelligence and it sounds like your girlfriend is really socially intelligent. She is warm and welcoming and can make anyone feel important which is a really important skill. 

If you're trying to talk to her about engineering things or other science topics it's not surprising she doesn't understand because she isn't interested. 

Only you can decide if being able to talk to your partner about these things is a requirement for you, or if you just need to find more areas in common with your current partner."
125,"This sounds great in theory, but I'd say not to do this. What if you damage her stuff in the process? Two wrongs don't make a right. This is different from a parent doing this to a child because a parent technically owns the child's belongings. OP doesn't own her roommate's property and damaging it could get her in trouble. 

Also what if the roommate retaliates and starts trashing OP's room? This is going to majorly up the conflict. The mature thing to do is to document the roommate's mess and present the evidence to the landlord, saying there's concern for a rodent or ant infestation, etc. 

Don't risk getting yourself in hot water for payback, as sweet as that all sounds. "
126,"Your current girlfriend isn't comfortable with the relationship you have with your ex. Eventually, you're going to have to choose which is more important to you: your relationship with your girlfriend or your friendship with your ex.   There is no logic that will ""rationalize"" away her jealousy or insecurity on this issue.   So you will have to pick. Literally anything you do with the ex will be seen as prioritizing her over your girlfriend.  One or the other, you can't have both.

That's pretty unforgivable stuff. 

You're a young guy, and you can find someone new. Hell, you're really too young to even be engaged. You're at an age where people grow and change so much. There's good life ahead for you, but not if you stay with a cheater who disrespects you so much."
130,Those arent the same thing. Being able to grow your own food is firstly not possible for many people and not a nessesity if you live somewhere with a supermarket as most people do. Not knowing how to cook however is expensive and/or unhealthy.
131,"&gt;You make more money than him. You do all the housework. He cusses you out when you ask him to help you.

132,"I don't think this actually is a financial issue. Why do you assume that he could have just overrode any veto she had over money spending and dipped into their savings? Presumably, they both have access to the bank account and if either one of them really wanted to do an end-run around the other, they could, but their financial deal is that the money he earned, minus a discretionary amount for each of them, is ""family money"" and has to be agreed on how it's spent.

This wasn't some double standard about his money vs. her money. I feel like people are trying to make it fit that mold when it just doesn't."

134,He didn't say it and you talk about his weight all the time so get over it.
135,So what are you gonna do about it?

137,"I'm really confused as to why this killed your trust for her. Who she dated 5+ years ago is no business of yours, at all, and keeping her past private isn't a lie or hiding it from you.

If anything, you are the one that violated her trust by snooping through her things. 

She's a private and reserved person. If you aren't happy with who she is, just leave instead of making up reasons to be upset with her. "

Yes, but this friend has a relationship, and I'm very good friends with their SO. "
141,"Often, when women talk about their problems, we're looking for validation, not solutions. She likely feels you're not supporting her because you're not acknowledging her feelings. "
142,Yeah my jaw dropped at that line. He is putting the burden of learning how to be an independent adult on her. Clearly it matters a lot to her (I would imagine to most women) and he can't even motivate himself to learn how to do it? Nope nope nope nope. 
143,"There's also us sports fans who can keep a level head.  I mean, I've got a buddy who works for ESPN and I'm not pumping him for info... I'll ask things from time to time but it's not a regular thing."
144,"&gt; whatever random box

Do you really think he's not giving you this ring you're so desperate for just to be arbitrary?  If you don't know exactly what needs to happen before he's comfortable proposing, then that's something you should be able to talk about and work through with him before you take this step.  (And if he doesn't know, then it's a particularly bad idea to push him, in case he figures it out after you're married and it turns out to be a dealbreaker; you can either give him time, or you can walk away.)"
145,"Yes, that's the difference in being a partner and being a parent. 

My husband went from home to dorm living to living with me and it was hard. On top of him needing to get used to doing things whether he wanted to or not and realize that there was no pop can fairy, we had to agree on what standard of clean living we even wanted to have. I refused to do everything for us, but it was like pulling teeth to work through things. I had to remind him that I chose to be his partner, but not his mom and that I was absolutely going to resent him if things didn't get better. I taught him a few basic things and then he used the Google machine to learn more. Now he's a regular subscriber to Cook's Illustrated and it's awesome. It was all worth it. 

But then again, we're now your current age and it took years to get here. I don't blame you for being turned off and not wanting to make such a commitment without him showing he's  motivated. Because you can't motivate him. He's got to find that himself. My point is that it IS possible for this to get better, but it won't be done in its own and it's not unreasonable to not want to parent your partner.  "
146,This. I think it all depends on how the father acted in regards to what was happening. It seems like he also just wanted to keep the peace and let his family feel crappy or was oblivious. Or he wasn't and tried. I don't think we'll know. But yeah. This.
147,"You see, she did point out that his brother's girlfriend of 6 months is coming despite it all being ""just for family"" and she pointedly is not supposed to.  

The older I get, the less shit I'm willing to take. And wouldn't be taking this one at all. "
148,You can't help someone if they do not want to help themselves. 
149,I think they mean committed to treatment and not committed to a facility. That was my impression anyway. Long term commitment to treatment and getting better is an absolute requirement for treating a personality disorder. It sounds like OP's husband is not commited to getting better and therein lies the problem.
150,"You don't know much about him, he could be a great husband. He is a human, a creature of error, and honestly it's hard to deal with a situation like this. She just needs to talk with him. Divorce should always be a last resort not a ""You hurt me one time and you're toxic so bye."" That's so not how relationships work. "
151,"She's not really your ex-wife if you're still married, you need a divorce with custody rules set in place. Go talk to a lawyer."
152,"You have posted similar things about your husband in the past.  The advice on all of them was to get out.  Please leave,  he is not a good partner. "
153,Don't be friends with this guy. He'll just take all of your emotional energy and make you comfort him over the fact that you dumped him and it made him sad. You have a number of significant problems that deserve all of your energy and self-care. Cut contact and invest your time in looking for another or a better job. Mourn your friend. Make a list of the most important attributes you want in a partner and don't let anyone who isn't what you deserve waste your time.
154,"Does he even own the house he's trying to play lord and master of?

He doesn't own you and he definitely doesn't own your genitalia. There are no magic words to reason him out of a belief he didn't reason himself into.

I'm sorry it hurts, but the truth is that people who don't love you unconditionally regardless of your natural, utterly normal sexuality don't love you. They may love an idea of the puppet they think you should be, but that's not enough. You're an adult now and you have to face the fact that you can't depend on your brother anymore if he chooses to ditch you over such a triviality."
155,"First of all, congratulations on opening up to her. Most people live with this until the situation becomes unbearable or just spill it out when drunk. 
&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I don't think she's my girlfriend or anything. I just don't know where we stand now. Before tonight, I had assumed she only saw me as a friend, but you don't have sex with people you only see as friends, do you? 
&amp;nbsp;

Sometimes people need time to process their feelings, but Yes, people do have sex with friends. The only thing that this makes clear is that she wanted to have sex with you, don't try to deduce her feelings, straight up ask her. A lot of people here will try to tell you what's been through her head, but she is the only person that can tell you that. The way she dealt with it could mean 1000 different things. Have a proper conversation, be brave and honest to your feelings!"

157,"Seriously.  Unless I was ready to leave right that instant and/or I had a long standing relationship with the grandfather, I would tell my SO to hurry and go, and to check in with me when he had the chance.  I'd also call my parents and explain why dinner with them needs to be postponed.  Most reasonable people would understand.

Just to consider things from her side, it's possible that the girlfriend is reacting to feeling like she's ""not welcomed"" or ""not wanted"" by not being invited to join in on OP's family grieving.  I can see why she might have felt abandoned when OP literally dropped everything and left (feeling can be irrational), but she could have stopped and at least considered things from OP's POV.  Ultimately, I don't think she really has an excuse for her behavior at all.

In the four-ish years I've been with my now-husband, I've unfortunately had to deal with a number of deaths or medical situations with either my family or close family friends.  My husband (then-boyfriend) would ask if I wanted him to come with me, and if I said no he'd stay home and periodically check in on how I'm doing.  He didn't have a hissy fit about being excluded from emotional family events."
158,"Cancer is just one of the things they were testing for. He most likely would have told you if it was confirmed.  I have had tests for different types of cancer as well, but I see no reason to tell anyone about a test until there is a diagnosis. Stop making this about you and be glad. "
159,"Nope, new counsellor.  And financial adviser.  Your old counsellor was wrong, and helped strong-armed him into a solution he didn't really agree with.

Suggest this to him.   Each of you should have a separate account that your paycheck goes into.  You set up the budget where he contributes about 2/3rds of all the bills and shared expenses.  Every paycheck he transfers $x into the shared account, from which you pay the bills and expenses.  Do this for 6 months and see if it works for you guys.  The cashflow is the same but this way he still has his own account as well.

Talk about the future.  When he makes more money he will need to transfer in a higher percentage.  Ensure that when you move you do not live beyond your means.  Discuss SAHM vs you working, and don't make it just financial; factor in what you actually want to do as well.  If at some point you become a SAHM, he will be transferring in 100% of the bills and baby expenses, plus some spending money to you as well.

If you liked Dylan but didn't text with him constantly and tell him super personal details of your life and go on double dates with him acting as your date, I'd say you could probably be friends with him, but...you are doing that stuff.  You aren't even super close friends and you're already crossing lines left and right.  If you're bored with your BF, just break up with him - he'll be fine.  It's completely unfair and uncool to have what I'd consider an emotional affair with Dylan behind his back."

However, your wording comes off as vapid so maybe that's something else you should try and figure out.

**edit**: Nevermind, reading all your responses confirms that you're a vapid shallow girl who is weirdly prideful about her appearance. You can enjoy being fit and want to have a fit partner, but I find it hard to believe that you seem to know all about being fit when you have no idea what goes into weightlifting and the process not to mention you're going to give in to your vain friends' opinions because you're being this terrible. Grow a spine, get better friends, and dump your boyfriend because he deserves better than someone who can't support him because he gained some weight ."

166,"&gt; And all the sudden he demands I tell him how he can fix this. What he can do to make me feel better. Asks me if I want food, asks what he can get me. He has apologized and told me he's done acting like that and acknowledges he has been terrible. Etc etc.

Tell him you want him to leave the house. He will likely refuse and go back to being his selfish asshole self, but at least you know in your heart that he's a bullshit artist and you're not deceiving yourself by accepting his love-bombing. 

Have you approached any churches in your area about help with accommodation. If you're in the US or Australia, contact St Vincent de Paul. Sometimes they can offer temporary accommodation for people escaping abuse.

He is abusing you. That is the truth. If he wasn't, you wouldn't be scared of leaving your cats behind, you wouldn't be shamed into isolating yourself from your friends, you wouldn't have been pressured to abort/keep the pregnancy, let alone being told that you won't get any support for your decision. I'm willing to guess that he got you pregnant on purpose to try and trap you into staying with him as it's a common abuser's method of keeping their victims from leaving."

Why are two 20-something year olds pulling on their kid brother like that to begin with, that isn't normal behaviour. Your husband not holding them accountable for their actions is likely a contributing factor to why Curly and Moe are doing the kind of stuff they're doing. Yes, they should pay for his medical treatment, and it's kind of mindblowing they aren't jumping at the chance to pay for it as a way to make amends.

Your daughters need to make their own mistakes, and your husband enabling them and refusing to treat them like the adults they are is going to keep them from maturing. Let them fuck up on their own and don't be there to clean up the mess, but for the love of God please make sure they don't play Stretch Armstrong with your son again."

I'm CF. When I talk about kids, either someone else asked me about them, or I'm commenting to my husband about how glad I am we don't have them, and how much I love our life how it is. I never say ""I'd love to have kids if XYZ were different.""

194,"I think you should tell her your side of this, and how her behaviors influence your desire to spend time with her. She seems to have cast herself very firmly as the victim, so it might be difficult to get through to her.
 If she doesn't respond to reason, you could make a list of behaviors that are unacceptable, like guilting you for choosing to live with your father or accuse family members of conspiring against her. Make it clear that if she engages in the behaviors listed, you will immediately end the interaction. Be aware that going this route demands consistency. If she insults you over the phone, hang up. If she insults your father in public, find the fastest way home. Don't engage her if she confronts you, pleads with you or tries to make you stay any other way.
 I suppose her seeking therapy is out of the question? You might want to consider speaking to someone yourself. It might help you understand her behavior and give you more tools to manage the situation.

Because she is divorced, but doesn't want her children to see that their father has moved on.  Very punitive behavior.

At any point in your relationship she could have met you, but chose not to.  Now she's forced to by circumstances and her daughter's decision. I understand her wanting to talk with you (about three years too late), but she should not be allowed to speak with you alone.  Your partner should be with you and a part of the conversation.

Stop letting her dictate how you and your partner act.  As long as you treat her daughter fairly and with kindness, she should not have imput.

Of course she is. Your mother is too mentally ill to form a healthy relationship, but not too ill to be lonely. She will probably always trade her limited resources for companionship. That's what people who can't have healthy relationships do. It's a survival mechanism. You could certainly tell her to shut the moocher out of her life, and she might even listen, but then what? There is no stable, equitable give-and-take relationship with a nice decent guy ahead of her. If you actually could convince her to hold out for Mr Right instead of Mr Right There, she will be alone until she dies. What she's planning is the lesser of the two evils, and she knows it.

So...pick your battles. Keep the lines of communication open. Be civil to the guy and kind to your Mom, and only try to intervene when absolutely essential. Otherwise, keep your own counsel and be someone she can come to if it all goes terribly wrong."

We started getting those the *day* we got engaged. And we were 20 and 21 at the time. And now that we are expecting our first child it's moved on to ""when you going to have the next!""

Because of this, I really recommend not saying something to your mentor. It sounds like her partner is just touchy-feely, kinda weird, and a little over the top. But I don't think he's necessarily hitting on you. Maybe you boss mentioned you don't talk about personal things much and he's trying really hard to seem like a friend or feel like he fits in at work events where he's the third wheel.  


But if you insinuating he's hitting on you, it's *not going to go well* with your boss. I promise you. Especially with no real evidence. You'll look full of yourself and a little bit crazy when the he-said-she-said hits the fan. 


I would just set boundaries with him about not touching like others suggested and mention that, nothing against him, but you don't really like talking about your personal life at work events. "
216,"Yeah I've been in your ex's shoes. 9 years and we were both 28, too. Weirdly enough he'd also made similar dumb friends who liked to cheat/fuck randoms. 

Yeah...you fucked up. Irreparably. You have probably learnt in life that if you say sorry enough times, someone will forgive you, but actually some things can't be forgiven. If she's the catch you say she is, then she has moved on, whether she's seeing anyone else or not. 

Just because she's not dating anyone, doesn't mean she'd be open to a relationship with you. I met my husband soon after becoming single, but I can assure you that I wouldn't have dated anyone else. I LOVED my new-found freedom of not having to worry about my ex's needs/wants all the time. It was fucking awesome. And it sounds like the exact same thing with YOUR ex. I would place a million dollar bet that she was an amazing partner to you, and is now feeling a sense of freedom in not having to look out for your whiny, selfish, entitled ass.

You still have a shitload of growing up to do, buddy. "
217,"Exactly! Op your husband is being a whiny immature baby and should definitely be put in time out. Ask him why he's upset about his brother being happy with a gift... would he have preferred to see his brother upset instead?

I've avoided this issue with gifts from me to his family always being from both of us but your husband needs to get over his issues if he doesn't want to come off less mature than the 12 Yr old."
218,"So, next time he gets 100k of free legal advice will he ask you to prostitute yourself? I have no idea why you haven't left yet....None of what you've written explains why you're still in the house with him. You're just a blow up sex doll to him. "
219,"This is so wrong it's laughable.

224,"So, how would he take care of himself if he wasn't dating you?

Seriously. His life is so hard. He can't be bothered to clean up his living space. What would he do in the event you weren't around to do it?

He can do. But why would he? You'll do it for him."

Like the one who called me a c, and no one, not even the DM (who was also my boyfriend at the time) said a word. No one. Why did he call me that? Because he tried to power pack his character to do everything and I made a little weird rogue and by chance of turn, after he did ridiculous amounts of damage to an enemy, I critted and made the actual kill. For this, I'm a c. I was legit more offended by no one saying anything than the actual name calling. I played it off (because you can't let someone like that think they've won), but I refused to game with any of them anymore. The sad thing is, there were 3 other women in this group, and every single other person was like, ""Oh sorry, I don't agree with him but I didn't want to make it awkward."" -_- Weak, dude. Super weak.

Op's cousin played a really stupid game and won a really stupid prize, and Op is guilty by association whether he likes it or not. I think you're right he needs to eat crow and *sincerely* apologize, make a point to not sit near his cousin at least for this class, and offer to transfer sections. Only changing sections is not only cowardly, but how can he be certain she won't end up his prof in a course he can't transfer out of? That's a bad risk."
237,"Did you just suggest she should have sex at a club? And lots of people have FWB that aren't strangers. The point is that these people have unrealistic expectations about sex and are imposing those ideas on their daughter. Of course they can make any house rules they want, they can ban red tshirts if they want, that's a stupid, controlling rule too. 

For her sake I hope she does move out. It's not a good idea to jump into buying a house after having never lived alone anyway. "
238,"I can't speak for the op but in my case, I'm scared. The reason why I know this is because the idea of having kids doesn't repulse me like it does child-free people. It freaks me out, and it overwhelms me, but I'm still not repulsed. 

I often catch myself thinking/saying: ""one day when - I mean if - I have kids..."". And even though I don't really like kids, I always feel joy with a pang of envy whenever someone announces that they're pregnant. 

I love the idea of having my own little family, complete with 3 (or more if I can get away with it) dogs in my future, but I'm terrified of  losing my freedom. 

But -- if my instinct to love and nurture little things is any indication, I'll probably go into mom-mode hard and love every second of it. So I know I want kids, I'm just scared."

And that might be an awkward conversation. ""Hi BF, I see that you're trying to help when you do X and I appreciate that you're there for me. What I really need right now is Y. Let's see if we can come up with some strategies that work for both of us."" You know what? Not everyone is good with emotional stuff. That's okay.

Do you think you'd have the financial security you currently have had you been raising a toddler alone for the last 4 years? What do think child care over those years amounts to? Why don't you look into the actual costs and how much childcare she covers while you are working. I think  coparenting has probably saved considerable amounts of money over the years and granted you that financial security. 

At first I thought you were asking your partner to give up her equal footing in the relationship so you could have security, but now I realize you don't even see her as your equal now. I think you should stop counting beans and start looking at the life you've been able to build because she was by your side. 

Personally, if my SO suggested what you are suggesting, I'm not sure I could get past the feeling that my contributions the relationship were unappreciated. I would be really hurt by it. "

I do belong to a small writer's group of five people who meet every two weeks over Skype. It's a crit group, basically - we distribute material to each other in advance, and spend two hours critiquing and workshopping each other's stuff.

It is an entirely voluntary endeavour, and if your BF can't be arsed to interact with his peers on even the most minimal level, and instead relies on you be his constant sounding board, then he is a lazy lazy bastard and is unlikely to be producing the dulcet prose that both you and he think he is.

I agree strongly with the user above that you're way overreacting. You can spend your money however you want, but cocaine isn't so addictive that one line hooks you forever. And even if it did, cutting off your kid is a better way to drive them further down that rabbit hole than to get them help.

And I too am confused as to why you included the line about him ""making love"" to the girl. Do you have some sort of moral objection to this in general? Because he's a 19 year old college student, so it's not really a shock that he might be sexually active."

285,"This is a hard situation to guage because there's more to the story probably...any of these probably could be true..

1) your projecting your own bias that you subconsciously have onto her.

2) You feel like she's being exploited because she's engaging in this for money but to you it feels like sex=money even though she's not prostituting herself. 

3) You like her and are acting jealous so make her feel bad about it to discourage her from doing it
 
4) She's your friend, you respect her,  and your concerned but you've become fixated on an issue that's not your problem or your decsision to make and it's beginning to weird her out. 

Whatever the issue is:

You're feelings are kind of irrelevent here. Support your friend and buck up. She's an adult. She acknowledged she can get other jobs but this is easy money for her. You aren't her boyfriend so it doesn't really matter if you're okay with it or not.

Except now she has confirmation the problems *were* there - and you knew it, at least as far as Michael was concerned.  She probably wouldn't be as upset as she is right now if you'd just acknowledged her feelings rather than dismissing them.

That said, the roommates she already knew didn't like her *really* not liking her is kinda small potatoes compared to what you're going through right now.

And I'm pissed right now because I am the one who is taking care of our six year old's needs mostly during this time because he's ""too sick"" (even though we all have the same sickness).

301,"&gt; I called my husband and yelled at him. HE STILL tried to defend Tom saying that Tom was just emotional because he hadn't seen his kids.

No. Telling Tom where to find Anna was horrible enough. Being told that Tom broke down a door and put Anna in the hospital and STILL defending him? Unacceptable, and I would have reacted the exact same way. 

You husband put many lives in danger:

* Anna's, most obviously

* Your cousin. Abusers do not just target their victims - they take their rage out on their friends and family as well. Sometimes fatally. 

* You - for the same reason as above. 

* Their children. It's not uncommon for an abuser to hurt their children to ""punish"" their partner


Continue living with your friends. Ignore your husband for as long as you need to. His family can fuck right off. 

Wait until this first wave of rage, anger, and betrayal has passed and you can think calmly and clearly about this. Then ask yourself: *Can you see yourself forgiving him? Can you see a future where you trust him again? What would it take to get there?* 

If the answers are ""no,"" ""no,"" and ""too much"" -- then off to the divorce lawyer. But give yourself some time to cool off first.

Ok, I somehow missed this part when I was reading it the first time:

&gt;

I honestly don't think there's any coming back from this. I could never forgive him. Never.

302,"Switch to formula. A lot of the research that finds a massive gap between the health of babies who are breastfed/formula-fed fails to take into account the socio-economic and lifestyle factors that make it more likely for a mother to be able to consistently breastfeed their child, so the difference is massively overstated (if it exists in any significant way at all). 

As for your girlfriend, you need to take your son and move out temporarily while you figure this out. He is currently not safe with her, and if you want to have any hope of her significantly changing she needs to realise how serious this is. Go to your parents' if you can, or to a hotel or something. She breastfed her child after doing coke, in this case I think there's little chance of her calling the police on you.  "

Conversely, if you said ""yes"" just to please her, you'd probably start to add up in your head your missing free time. So you need to have serious talks about it, with an open mind on both sides, to at least really understand each other points of view.

Did you have a conversation about it ? Did she say *why* another kid was important to her ? Did you explain your reasons for not wanting one ? How did she respond ? Could you see yourself changing your mind in the future ? could she ?"

Maybe the signs were there and you didn't see them.

It's done. Move out. Maybe once you've both come to terms with it, he can tell you on a deeper level why he broke it off, but he doesn't want to discuss it now because you might get pushy again and push him back together with you. He sounds mentally exhausted. "

You only have time for her ""part-time"" company right now anyway, and she's perfectly happy with going out with friends and doing her own thing when you are unavailable. If she were as introverted as you, she might resent your lack of time that you have for her, as she may want to just hang out at home with you every night and not want to hang out at home alone. But because she has a strong social network, she finds things to do while you're busy instead of pining over you. 

This should be the perfect set up. The only issue is that you don't like that she goes out with friends for some reason, even though you wouldn't be able to hang out with her then anyway. Seems like something you ought to get over if you trust her like you say you do, no? "
311,"Learning another language is a huge commitment as an adult.

He may also find it easier and more motivating to learn the language if placed in an environment where knowledge of it would help.  For example if you took a trip to your country of origin for a few weeks, he might get a lot more interested in continuing to pursue DuoLingo.

Ahh, this sounds familiar.  This threat was how my father kept my mother in their marriage so long.  Tell me: would you EVER in a million years threaten to leave the children you love so much just to hurt him?  Because that's what he's doing.  To me, that says he doesn't really love them all that much, if he's using them as a pawn to keep you in a bad marriage.  If he actually loves his kids and wants to be a good father, he wouldn't threaten to abandon them when they've done nothing wrong and you aren't putting huge obstacles in the way (like accusing him of sexually abusing them or something).  That's not what a good father does."

Setting boundaries with previous hookups or SO's is a given, but within reason.  She can't control who likes her pictures or social media posts.  Nor does it mean anything.

318,Tell your friend the truth and prepare for the potential fallout.
319,"&gt; I like to call myself his work wife. 

I internally cringed a lot upon hearing that. I find it really gross how you can call someone that when they are in a relationship. It is a creepy and inappropriate term and I would not want to be friends with you if you ever said anything like that to my SO.

&gt; My best friend can be very bossy and manish to her boyfriend. She rules over every aspect of his life and he seems to be very passive and okay with it. She wears the pants, if you catch my drift.

So you're talking shit about someone who is supposed to be your best friend, insulting her in a sexist manner (bossy and mannish, really?) and victimizing her SO. When in reality she probably just is outspoken and up front with her boundaries, something that I respect.

&gt; She was adamant about not having strippers at his bachelor’s party. She said she would end the relationship and jokingly threatened to beat him up if she caught him with a stripper.

So she laid down a boundary but tried to cut it with a bit of joking about beating him up just so he knew how serious she was but also didn't want to seem like a total control freak (especially since even her best friend pretty much thinks that about her. I am assuming since you think this this means that her SO/your coworker probably confides about their relationship to you.) Lovely, it is good she was honest about being uncomfortable with strippers. 

&gt; I saw this as perfect comedy material.

That's not a joke, that's you blatantly disrespecting your friends wishes because you disagree with her and undermine her in her relationship and you want to insult her. To me the way you describe her is how I would describe somebody I do not even like, and the fact that you want to disrespect her wishes so easily makes me think you are jealous of her or that you are a very mean, spiteful person on the inside.

&gt; I decided to jokingly hire strippers to come to his bachelor party, which was at my other male friend’s apartment. No one was in on the joke.

There is zero way this would be taken as funny and you were being deliberately secretive and deceptive with this ""joke"" because you knew it would not be taken well.

&gt; I assumed my friend’s fiancé, who was raised Mormon, would be embarrassed and would 
refuse a lap dance.

WOW so not only is he just someone who agreed to not have strippers but he is also a Mormon. What a really considerate and funny joke of you.

&gt; She called her fiancé every hour to check up on him and make sure no strippers were there.

I wonder why she was so paranoid. If someone didn't read carefully they might even focus on this sentence but I feel like you're exaggerating her controlling tendencies. Even if not, she had a nagging gut feeling which ended up being completely correct because you are a horrible friend.

&gt; At some point, he did not answer the phone. She said we needed to leave the bar right now 
and interrupt the party.  I thought she was joking but she paid the tab and ran outside in a frenzy. 

Wow, wonderful, so your friend repeatedly makes a boundary, is clearly not enjoying herself at her bachelorette(?) function and is paranoid and confiding in you. The entire time this joke is going on you do not think to tell her for one second that he has a stripper nor do you think to tell her you ordered one nor do you think to do anything. In fact I am assuming you probably encouraged it. I love how you like passing it off as ""lol I thought she was joking."" It's all one big joke to you, isn't it? Your friends feelings and boundaries and concerns and insecurities and wishes and fiance and marriage are just one big joke, might as well shit on all of them because it was just a prank bro, am I right?

&gt; We followed her and arrived at the apartment. She banged on the door for ten minutes straight until someone answered.

I love how you manage to follow her all the way to the apartment and watch her freak out without saying one bit. You are a coward. You knew what was going to happen and you chose not to speak up.

&gt; She pushed the guy aside and went into the bedroom where my friend’s fiancé was receiving a lap dance.

Well, birds of a feather do flock together. The fiance was also a pretty huge piece of shit too for taking a lap dance when his fiancee specifically asked him not to do that. Many men do not have strippers at their bachelor's party and it's a very gross and backwards tradition, one last 'hoo rah' before getting married when most people should be over the moon about dedicating their life. It's funny how you think your opinions and choices matter more than theirs about their life and you decided to insert your own beliefs in their and order one stripper. It's so funny at this point, right, haha? I love how you played the long con with this joke too and didn't once bother to explain or take ownership for your joke.

&gt; She started throwing food and items all over and slapping the boyfriend.

I love how you like describing this as though your friend is ""crazy"" or ""overreacting"" but you never once mention the fiance's reaction. Just the whole time negative and horrible things about your friend that paint her in the worst light while you are the cool friend and your poor poor victim co-worker is just abused and being so controlled in this relationship.

&gt; The stripper ran out and I apologized to her in the hall way.

""Sorry it was just a prank xD I know I put you in a terrible, unsafe position when you are probably doing this job to pay bills and make ends meet and you are constantly in unsafe positions but it was just supposed to be so funny though am I right??""

&gt; At that point I felt bad and decided to secretly go home during the commotion.

I love how you still at this point just leave without accepting responsibility, apologizing to your friends, explaining anything.

**tl;dr** You are a massive, lying piece of shit who managed to singlehandedly destroy your alleged ""best friends"" marriage systematically. You refused to own up any responsibility and still are doing so and you speak about the person you allegedly care about as though she is literal human garbage. You are the worst kind of friend and sincerely have likely destroyed two lives, possibly more as it makes waves throughout the community. I would say come up and say something but now obviously with consequences high and the fact that you didn't the entire time this happened means you are likely not going to own any responsibility. Shame on you. I sincerely think you were jealous of your ""friend"" or attracted to the boyfriend or you have serious issues for wanting to damage this relationship and I am saying ALL of this in the hopes that this might plant a seed of guilt in your mind and allow you to be honest and get this in the air so that the entire families of those two, them themselves, mutual friends and other members of the community aren't left in awe by this. You are likely going to lose your friend, possibly multiple and I hope you take this as a life lesson and never do something this callous and hurtful again. That is my advice to you: Fess up. Accept full responsibility. NO excuses. Be honest to everyone and publicly as your ""joke"" now brought multiple people involved. Recognise your mistakes, internalize this, and NEVER do something like this again. And I want you to seriously reflect on why you systematically did this. You and I know it wasn't a joke, it wasn't funny, you knew it wouldn't be received well and you basically encouraged it every step of the way. WHY did you really do it? You don't have to answer to me but you do have to answer to yourself and your guilty conscience and I highly encourage therapy for you to work out whatever made you lack empathy to do this.

I had a relationship that lasted 5 years at 20. I thought I would never be able to be with anyone else. and now I'm perfectly happy with my current partner, and all those years are just distant memories even though they felt truly intense at the time.

331,"Next time you need new furniture, just ask him to build it instead. If he says he's not a carpenter, you can explain how your dad came home from work, ate dinner with the fam, then spent the night in his shed. This is how men relax, alone in the shed building stuff for fun. Also, back in your day you didn't call electricians or throw out electrical equipment, your dad fiddled around with it in his shed and this is how he learned how the stuff works. If he couldn't fix it, then you bought a new one if you could afford it. Sitting down to watch the footy with a beer was only done on the weekend, but your dad preferred fishing with this best mates anyway, and he caught some good fish too. Men's hobbies were much more useful back in the day. Today it's watch TV, sit on reddit, watch porn blah blah.

I don't suggest you say any of this to him, except maybe point out his diaper example is shitty because there is no such profession as Diaper Changer, but hairdressing is a skilled trade. Hairdressing beyond a buzzcut is not a domestic duty, much like building furniture beyond putting together ikea furniture. But what is important is the balance. If he is actually doing masculine skilled trades (e.g. carpentry, mechanic, eletrician, handy man) as a hobby maybe he expects feminine  skilled trades (e.g. hairdresser) from you.

Which is fair because he doesn't have to do anything he doesn't want to but then no change means it's time to go for me. 

Still been crying since then but I dunno. It's for the best I guess. "

342,"Two things:

First, I don't date flirts. I'm not taking a moral high ground or saying ""flirts are bad and need to change their ways!"" I just choose not to date them because I think how they act is sort of disrespectful, and may inadvertently lead to an affair. You might have the same attitude as me, and rather than asking him to change (he won't, he's said himself it's just how he is) finding someone who similarly thinks the behaviour is crossing the line. 

Second, I find it troubling that your boyfriend is telling you to just forget about it and dismissing your feelings. I get that he wants you guys to act like it never happened, but it did. While you can't crucify him forever, you're allowed to mention it when certain behaviours of his make you uncomfortable based on what happened. Relationships change after cheating, and try as you may you can't forget it. He needs to understand that and rather than tell you to forget about it make you feel like you shouldn't be feeling what you are, he should want to talk it out."
343,"Sit him down. ""I feel like I'm being put second place to your friend. I'm still really hurt that I never got a Christmas present and she did. And I feel like you're neglecting our relationship in favor of the friendship. I want you to be able to keep your friendships, and I'm glad you have a close friend. But, I still want to feel valued while you are maintaining your relationships.""


Might not be the best phrasing, feel free to tweak it and make it your own. But it sounds like you've been silently suffering, and you need to let him know. "

I've noticed a few of my friends do it as well, but we are all in our 30's-40's so I guess we're less glued to our phones? Not that this excuses any of her behavior, but it does happen. "

348,End the friendship. Tell them you will not stand for that. Ghost them if you have to.
349,"Here's the thing though - if he says no, then he's NOT the right person for you.  I know you like him, but you're not going to be happy if he strings you along for months or years and still refuses to commit.  This isn't the only guy in the world.  He might not be mature enough for the type of relationship you're after, so why waste your time hoping he might change his mind."
350,This guy sounds mega creepy/pushy.  Continue to ignore him since he is obviously obsessed in an unhealthy way.
351,"I'm very pro-weed. But if you can't afford a bar of fucking soap, but you're waking up every morning just to smoke before he goes to work, then that's a fucking problem. You're living an addict's life with a non-addictive substance. I don't care who pays for what, where, when, why, how. You got a 4 year old child, I know you're a child yourself, but it's time to grow the fuck up and get your priorities straight. "
352,"Nope. You need to get out. He is treating you terribly; just because he isn't 100% awful doesn't mean he's not still awful. There is absolutely nothing wrong with you and EVERYTHING wrong with the way he is controlling your emotions to make you feel like garbage. This is emotional abuse, and you do not deserve this. You deserve to be with someone who makes you feel like the best version of yourself, and like you can do anything- not make you feel worthless. It's also possible that he treats you like a child because of the age difference, and naturally feels superior/smarter/more educated than you; regardless, none of that is an excuse for treating you like that. "
353,I think you're confusing marital satisfaction with general happiness. Further (if I recall correctly) happiness only returns to pre-baby levels after children move out. I don't remember reading any literature on grandchildren. 
354,"Wow, 20 pounds is an extremely small weight gain, I can't imagine that he actually became unattracted to you over such a minimal increase. I think there are some other issues he is having and that telling you that you gained weight and he isn't attracted is his way of deflecting the blame and avoiding the real issues.

EDIT: it looks like people aren't reading the post. This isn't a case of the relationship was good and then the OP gained weight and her bf became unattracted. They've had sexual issues from the beginning. "
355,"I don't know if this will help, but I had to have this conversation with my husband... except that it was me telling him (as gently as possible) that his weight gain was making it hard for me to be sexually attracted to him. I still loved him the same. I enjoyed being around him the same. But he... kinda gave up on taking care of himself and that made *me* feel less loved and desired. It made me feel like I wasn't worth the same effort anymore, and it made him feel less confident. All in all, it wasn't doing good things for us.

He was really mad at me for a day (which he didn't tell me until later), and then the next morning he went out, got a haircut, and some new clothes. He realized that he *had* stopped taking care of himself. He started working out again and, before the weight even started going down, I felt attracted to him again. 

I don't know exactly what your situation is, but you accusing your boyfriend of telling you that he finds you repulsive when he didn't say that is really not fair. I think you are WAY overthinking this and you're accusing him out of a place of hurt and insecurity. I know it was an unpleasant thing to hear, but you asked him and he answered honestly. 

I think what you need to do now is to take a step back and ask yourself if YOU are happy with where you are at. Are you putting in the same amount of effort as you were before or close to it? Is *he*? Are you guys coasting along? If so, what do you want to change and/or remain the same? Figure that out for yourself first and, if you still want to be with him, have a calm discussion about what you both need and want in order to move forward. 

ETA: I do find it concerning that the sex has never been that great and he seems to be rather bad with intimacy. So just keep in mind that the bad sex might be the best you're ever going to get with this guy. If you're not okay with that (and I don't think I would be), it's time to move on. "
356,"Holy shit I need a link to this video, like YESTERDAY, right!?"
357,"It seems to me that by going through your bf she's manipulating you to more easily say yes. I'd point blank refuse to consider the question unless she asks you directly, thus projecting your power over the situation."
358,"If you really love her then leave her alone. If she comes back to you hoping for a reconciliation then you can do everything in your power to not be a total asshat moving forward. 

I hope that she wants to have nothing to do with you ever again because you seem to be selfish, self-centered, self-absorbed, and I would guess you have low self-esteem that even being in a relationship with a woman way out of your league could not put a dent in.  Take this time to work on yourself so you can at least hope to be a better person in the future to someone else because I do not think you will ever be good enough for your ex-girlfriend."

361,What about Sally makes her sound like a great person?  Her family disowned her and all we have to go off of is that OP thinks she's a great mom.  There's more to this story that we don't know about.
362,"Leaving to try to make her ""relieve some of the power"" from her side is manipulative and will not end well"
363,"&gt;We played it cool, but the danger of this situation was too sexy not to take advantage of. We began throwing each other seductive glances, flirting without anyone noticing except my roommates who were in on the secret. Finally, she messed up, and he caught her sending a text to me behind his back.

So....you both found it super hot to be sneaking around. Sounds like you both thrive on drama and hurting others. Maybe this is the perfect relationship for you. "
364,"He should handle them better in future relationships, and stay far away from this girl. "
365,"A bridesmaid is not your personal wedding staff. Asking people to be a part of your wedding party is not an excuse to farm out duties and stress to them, especially something so monumental like this at the last moment. 

You have every right to be upset and to have been stressed over this. Its a very rude thing for them to have done. 

Honestly, it sounds like they have either been using their wedding money to live off of, overspent on a particular item (my guess is Pippas dress), and/or planned a lavish honeymoon with a portion of the money. Bottom line- they have misspent the money and have stepped on Marks fathers toes, yours, and probably a ton more peoples. Also, how does a wedding cake ""fall through""? They either didnt buy one in the first place or they didnt have enough to pay the remainder of the balance. All of this just screams poor planning, misspent money, and terrible treatment of family and friends. 

Maybe it really is time to rethink Pippa as a friend. "
366,"\*squints* No, but for entirely different reasons. 

EDIT: Yeah, I totally missed that this was a joke post. Total fail on my part. \*facepalm* "
367,"So I want to ask the obvious question, why haven't you divorced her? 

You're obviously a bigger person than most to be able to overlook and forgive her infidelity, but I can't believe that after it all she still insists to be his friend, she wants to take your children to this mans house? 

Arrange marriage counselling, or realise your worth and find someone who treats you right."

375,"Lots of people take family vacations. But they're vacations taken after couples have had their own vacations. I don't mean that chronologically, but in terms of priority. Family vacations are what you do with your leftover resources after you as a couple have met your own need to rejuvenate, bond, and strengthen as a couple, and it's typically negotiated among the parties, both family and affected in-laws. So, at Christmas, my kids, their partners, and we got together. We talked about their other commitments (seeing other family), how much leave they had, how much money they had, and how we could make dates and costs and locations work so that everyone's needs were met. The assumption was that everyone had their own need for personal time and couple time that had to be met if the arrangement was to work. It was not assumed that couples just had to suck up what we wanted. That is how healthy family vacations work. They respect the primacy of each person's primary relationship."

I would never even consider ending it because of the distance, and after two years of college we have only grown together and not apart."

380,"It's a flag, I wouldn't say it's a red flag. You can keep dating him and see if a pattern develops.

He might be managing a mental illness and associated suicidal thoughts. Or maybe he just has some weird romantic fantasy about rock stars and artists that died young. Or maybe he was just nervous and told a bad, insensitive joke. These things don't necessarily prevent him from being good relationship material."
381,"Friends of mine have three little ones and they love to smoke marijuana. However, only one parent smokes at a time and it is not around the kids. That's what being responsible is.

382,"I'm a little like you but have more sympathy for OP at the moment, she came early, tried not to ruin his existing plans (probably tried too hard!) and then he just kept saying ""wait there, I'll be back soon"" but never actually arriving?

383,"You spelled ""ex-girlfriend"" wrong.

He is not a friend, she knowingly went down a path that is disrespectful to you and the relationship. If you were not giving her something that she needs she should have relayed that to you. If you want to remain with her, she no longer gets to keep him as a friend and she no longer contacts him. I would suggest counseling, but really I would just cut my losses and get on with being single."

388,"I'm not a medical professional but what you've written interests me and I wonder if you might have any insight. My husband and I are vegans. He has been strict for 20+ years. I became strict, moving from being mostly but not strictly vegetarian to vegan, when we moved in together early 2012. I had a baby and breastfed mid 2014. At that time my B12 was checked and was good. By September 2015 I was having some weird neurological symptoms. As part of a check up it was discovered that my B12 was very low, the GP said, that it was almost undetectable. My husband and I were eating the same foods and his was fine. I had to have an accelerated schedule of B12 shots to get me back on track and I now use a sub-lingual spray daily. Even so, I'm struggling to keep my levels within normal range. I had another baby 2015 but consumed animal protein during that pregnancy to help avoid repeating the previous B12 deficit. 

Do women lose B12 more quickly than men due to menses or does breastfeeding use up B12 at a faster rate? It seems odd that my more longterm vegan husband has better B12 than I, who spent 9 months recently ""cheating"" and who supplements. "
389,"Not who you asked, but I know that many of these studies only use male subjects and bodies to conduct research, even though women may have vastly different responses or interactions. Perhaps the original study was conducted only on males and we have no data for females."

391,"I think your boyfriend would benefit from therapy, but I also think that you need to realize that you can't change or ""fix"" people who don't want to change.  He feels uncomfortable and insecure about something and it's not about you or how he feels about you.  This is a boundary that he is not comfortable crossing and he's made it quite clear to you.  Whether you think it's weird or not doesn't matter when someone sets a hard boundary.  Either it's a dealbreaker or it's not."
392,That's very true. I do have fixer syndrome a lot of the time which im definitely going to work on. But apparently it was a deal breaker too. He's been texting me about staying together but this issue will pop up again in the future so I guess Ill have to move on :/

398,"Oh sure he can have preferences, but I can also mock them. I also don't think it's ridiculous; we know there are people (of both sexes) out there who will compromise a lot when it comes to living a comfortable life with someone with money.

The issue is really that 'dating someone who's 20 when I'm 40' really has nothing to do with preferences, with partnerships, relationships, personalities... he's basically saying he'd like to be old with wrinkles but like a young, hot thing on his arm."

406,"He may not ever talk to you again and you should prepare yourself for that possibility. That said, have you considered writing him a letter? A real letter, on paper, with a stamp.

There's something special about receiving an actual letter, he's more likely to read it than if you made contact a different way. However you decide to go about it, just make contact once then leave him to it.

Anatomically, some people just carry a little bit more fat around their stomach, or they have a shape that causes it to stick out a little no matter how much fat is there. Currently, if I pinched my stomach, I wouldn't pinch very much fat at all. There's very little to grab. Yet somehow my stomach is always sticking out a little. I'm just shaped like that.

That just doesn't convince me, everyone changes how they see things around them, it's just growing up because everything around you is changing, but we are in a spot where we have a good life and there's nothing changing around us.

Why was it ruder for you to politely bow out with 3 weeks notice than for her to disinvite him with the same amount of notice?

&gt;He thought he should pay his house cleaner $80/hr

He sounds like a child.

I'm sorry but I couldn't be with anyone that divorced from the real world.


Mostly because that also interferes with the advice I always give on money: Both of you designate what you have as ""fun money"". and run things accordingly. 

In a full sharing relationship I'd expect the fun money to be shared. Like if he made 10k above expenses and you 1k you'd both get 5.5k.


But a year in I'd at least expect him to take shit into account. And I'd expect both of you to just have a conversation like ""I have 200 a month to spend"" ""O I have 400"", Lets do this together and you pay every other meal. 

But seriously, if he's trying to pay his cleaner 80 dollars an hour he's a total idiot. That means he never had a job as a teen. He never lived as a normal person. He's never had an allowance. 

So don't go for things like ""lets save together"" (that's more of a marriage thing) or ""lets make our own dinner"" (that's a saving cents on dollars thing) and more a realistic approach to money. There has to be a middle way where you can just discuss finances. "
434,"Girl, it's a 5 month-long relationship. It's not worth your time. He's clearly lying, no one spends the night at an ex's house and pretends like nothing happened.

Do you really think there aren't any women who use logic in the same way you do? You're totally off base. Do a little research if you believe otherwise. 

Also, you oversimplify people to a generalized view based on their gender and have a mindset about relationships that most people expect to see in teenagers. That's not meant to have a negative connotation, unless you take it that way. "
436,Your attempt to educate yourself is not stupid. 
437,What an awesome description of dating &amp; chronic illness! Saving this!
438,Totally...but they will prefer hope to reality.
439,This. Text book caterpillar to butt(head) scenario. He will realize what he is doing in a couple of years sadly.
440,"Not only for you, OP, but for any women it sounds like. Just in your post you mention two women who blocked him because he was being so inappropriate. Your husband is a pushy abusive pig, leave him!"
441,I feel pretty sad for you :(. This is not a good update in my books. I think you care about her a hell of a lot more than she does about either you or Hannah.
442,One of my dad's friends had a baby that died of sudden infant death syndrome before I was born. I found out that it scared him so badly that he slept on the floor next to my crib to make sure I would still be breathing during the night. He was such an awesome dad. 😭
443,"i don't agree. why should he humor her by going to therapy he doesn't need? it really just sounds like OP's significant is a little insecure about needing therapy when he doesn't, especially considering his upbringing.


It's obvious that OP does not think he needs therapy, so why open the door to her saying ""it worked so well go again"" or something to that effect? I think he should politely shut down the issue if he doesn't want to go."
444,"not unheard of that he would get in a fight with a supposed friend and that friend would try to mess with his relationship but i mean this entire situation sounds sketchy.

first, if your relationship was a secret, how would the roommate know to contact you to start even messing with you? and knowing that his roommate tried to mess with his relationship, he's STILL friends with him as if everything was normal? and on top of this, your relationship is a complete secret?

everything adds up here, but the result isn't a good one"
445,This is awful advice about putting his Father's ego over his own happiness.
446,"At first I just thought he was self conscious about his sexual prowess (perhaps another partner had used it against him?) but yeah, it kinda seems like he's hiding...something from you. I'd address that before I addressed the lack of sex, because my guess is that he's worried you're not going to be satisfied by him in bed. I don't know *what* to guess about the avoiding going to his house. 

If you want it to check out his place, I'd say something like, ""Hey, let's watch (something you both like) at your place this weekend! I'll bring (food, some board game, whatever) so we have more to do after."" And if he denies that, tell him you feel he's keeping you away from his house and it is hurting your feelings/makes you wonder how invested he wants to get in your relationship."
447,Guilt over snooping should go away when you have cause and it turns out to be justified. You did the right thing. Move on. 
448,"Thank you!!

It's anecdotal, but I know that is definitely an issue for me. I'm not even that heavy anymore (~4 pounds overweight currently) and generally like my body, but it definitely bothers me that I have curves while my guy has not an ounce of fat on his body. I would guess she's very aware of your differences in body type. Like I said, just make a habit of complimenting her and reinforcing your attraction to her. Good luck! :)"
449,"If this is out of character, it might be a smokescreen for a big surprise."
450,Tell him he can invite one more friend because you are not going. Otherwise you are literally giving him permission to walk all over you. You give in now the next time he is going to push the boundary even more. 
451,"&gt; If he was a jerk it'd be easier.

Repeatedly driving while drunk? That's far beyond ""jerk"" territory."

454,"Your boyfriend is a child trying to act like a man, and doing a terrible job of it. 

He feels disrespected? Does he how know disrespectful it is to have you sneak out of your house, then tell you that you don't have to listen to your older and much more mature brother?

Usually it's the people least deserving of respect whining about being disrespected. "
455,Hmmm... but rollercoasters are fun...
456,"Consistency is key. Know your animals. Positive reinforcement before negative reinforcement. 

For example my cats like to get on the kitchen counter to look out the window. They know they're not supposed to be up there but if it's the only window available then they'll do it regardless. This isn't a problem if I keep the blinds open in other rooms but if all of the other windows are blocked off then they will get on the counter. So I keep the blinds open during the day and they stay on the back of the couch. 

Another example: my cats like to get on my computer where the fan is because it blows warm air. They also know that they're not supposed to be there but it's been cold out so they've been sneaking naps there anyway. So I got them an extra cat bed, that's the positive reinforcement. Since they seemed to still like the computer I put some spiky plastic strips on the fan to keep them off of it. That's the negative reinforcement. 

If I ever do happen to catch them on the counter or computer (which is rare these days) I chase them off with a yell and a smack on the butt or squirting them with the spray bottle. When they're on the couch or their beds they get praise and pets and love."
457,"Hey, I know it's a tall order..."
458,"&gt;She apparently blew this guy ... but she came over ... We made out, had dinner and spent the weekend together.

If I read that right, she blew a guy and then almost immediately went and made out with you. Thats a big nope in my book. Although she is right that because you were not exclusive she could do that, she could have put you in danger of STIs given that her and the other guy were not exclusive either."
459,"My thought as well. It would explain why she's reacting so strongly... if the neighborhood 'kids' saw him he could be put on a registry or something. Sort of like that guy who was caught peeing really close to a playground and they basically accused him of being a pedophile.

wait was that an SVU episode or real life"
460,"I'd find it off putting if my girlfriend of two years was too afraid to say ""I love you"" to me. "
461,Ugh you are literally my fave reddit redditor right now. So glad you didn't put up with his BS. 
462,"Look. All I can say is that I've been in OP's shoes, and if I had been assigned the name of the racist white side of my family, I very well may have changed it as well.

It feels shitty being related to people who don't give a fuck about you because of what you are. I don't blame OP for wanting to distance himself.

And honestly, it sounds as though OP's dad did fuck all to protect OP, so his feelings here are irrelevant in my opinion."
463,Just block him and move on. Don't waste any more time or energy on this dude. 
464,[removed]
465,"I really wonder about the partner. I've known friends who have started excluding people in their lives or becoming distant to certain friends solely because their new SO hasn't liked that friend or has been a controlling asshole or whatever the case may be. Or the other way around, friends no longer want to hang out with one particular person because their new partner is a bad influence on them, or just not a nice person. Sometimes distance does happen organically, you just grow apart, but other times there's definitely a reason, and that reason can easily be the new partner. But there's no info about the partners of either friend here, so who knows."
466,"Your husband has a mental illness that he doesn't want to treat.
You have done nothing wrong if your account is accurate and you are protecting your kids by keeping them away from him. 

 I'd get divorced, go for full custody and only supervised visitation given his violent outbursts. 

I'd move in with family. I'd also get a restraining order given his history of violence and throwing things at you. It may not work but it covers you incase you have to defend yourself. I'd also consider a concealed carry permit"
467,"Or he has looked it up, but hasn't told his girlfriend."
468,"So if she doesn't mind you walking ahead, go for it. My son does this with me as he's really tall and kind of hyper. He goes ahead a bit and either waits or circles back around to me. If we are having a conversation sometimes he will face me and walk backwards. "
469,"Whoa lady you are way out in left field.  Either you are happy with him or you are not.  If so, be happy.  If not, move on.  Its that simple.  If you want him to change this early on to please you, if you are thinking life, marriage, and babies after dating a month and having sex 1 time, you are certifiable. "
470,"I'd just go ahead and do it. Your mom probably isn't stupid and knows your brother are being weasels. You'll probably get extra brownie points for not being useless, which is likely end up working to your advantage later on. "
471,"Based on your later comments, it seems that all your disagreements end in him over-ruling you. Welcome to the rest of your life: no compromises, his way or the highway."
472,"Then you're the ""strange"" one. I don't think anyone can make you understand what is strange about your behavior.

It's like a monogamous person talking to a polygamist. The monogamous says, *""but what would you feel to see your husband having sex with another woman""*, and polygamist says, *""I would have found it perfectly normal and okay""*. Just to be sure, I'm not saying that you intend to cheat or anything like that - this is an analogy - it's just that your world view is so distinct from your husband's (and in this particular case, from the overwhelming majority of people) that I don't see how there can be a consensus here."
473,"Everyone is giving you good advice. I want to add the perspective of a super duper Jesus freak Christian in case any religious aspects are holding you back. (Since you mention you want to""get right with God"")

The first step of getting right with God is to move in the direction you think He wants for your life. Does He want you to partner in marriage with this person? Or does He want you to reject the choice to partner with your husband and instead move in a new direction? That's for you to answer, but here are two very clear scriptures that show your husband being in direct opposition to the Bible: 

God did not give you a spirit of fear. He can give you a spirit of power and of love and a sound mind. (2 Timothy 1:7) That's what is actually in the Bible. The truth is that God wants to give you power. He actually wants you to be a woman full of power. Does your husband want this? Does he want you to be a powerful woman? Does he encourage you to walk in this power? Or does he do the exact opposite?

Another scripture that might help you: ""where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty."" (2 Corinthians 3:17). Not control. Liberty. Does your husband give you liberty? Does he encourage you to walk in and rejoice in liberty? Or does he do the exact opposite?

Be free and get out if that's the choice you want. "
474,He should tell her SO.  You're protecting her.  She's trying to fuck your BF and you're giving her the benefit of the doubt just because she's lonely.  You can't give people exception just because X reason.  They still have to function like a rational human being.  She's essentially cheating on her BF by trying to get with your BF.  You're response and actions in this matter are really surprising to me.  I don't think you're seeing what's really going on.  I'd be mad at you for (seemingly) not taking it seriously.
475,"I get she's not doing it on purpose but she is still ignoring your very simple request and that *is* on pupose. Sit down and have a ""come-to-jesus"" talk with her. If that still doesn't work, maybe have some clothes you keep at work or in the car for work. You can have your shirts professionally luandered and she won't wear them. That would be a last ditch effort though and I would try the talk first."
476,"""Zoals de waard is vertrouwt hij zijn gasten""? 

The English equivalent I think would be:

Ill doers are ill deemers

Or

Evil doers are evil dreaders

Or

Ill doings breed ill thinkings. 

Meaning, OP, that this concept is not new at all. And is common enough that there are many more just like that out there. There's often some truth in it, as people for who the evil thing isn't even an option, often don't suspect other people to think of it. It's very possible that she didn't trust you because she knew she ~~also~~ couldn't be trusted. "
477,"Yeah, that means that their grandparents are third cousins, their parents are fourth cousins, and they're fifth cousins. That barely counts as related! If you count back, their great-great grandparents were first cousins. Their great-great-great grandparents were siblings. 

Now, you have two parents, four grandparents, eight great-grandparents, sixteen great-great grandparents, thirty-two great-great-great grandparents, and sixty-four great-great-great-great grandparents. That means that they share two great-great-great-great grandparents out of their sixty-four great-great-great-great grandparents. So they have sixty-two great-great-great-great grandparents not in common. "
478,"Your girlfriend's parents seem too irrational to grasp that taking Plan B after a contraceptive failure is in fact the opposite of careless. That sucks, but you're unlikely to change their minds.

Make an appointment with Planned Parenthood so she can get a pregnancy test as soon as possible. Be emotionally supportive, but let her take the lead on handling things with her parents."
479,"He is territorial about all of his devices, but not to the point that it is a worry."
480,Because no one can figure out what's actually going on. It reads like a predictive text generator.
481,"Right?? What does she mean that the idea of marriage makes them uncomfortable? Then all of a sudden they had one talk and they're ""engaged"" but were too scared to talk about it before? And are too scared to hash out the details thereafter? So many questions"
482,"Don't worry, I wouldn't be bothered to actually carry that out haha"
483,Presumptuous and manipulative. 
484,"&gt; I absolutely think you shouldn't host her but I think you may be able to shift the battleground by changing it to, ""It's great that she does want us to get on! Maybe she can come up on her own another time, and we can see how that goes. Maybe in [september/november/whenever works for you], and if that works out, maybe she and some friends can stay with us in the future."" Make it all about that-- she's turned over a new leaf? Then she can show it, and then you can maybe be friends!

Wanted to reiterate this because it is such a good idea!"
485,"well, that, or you don't respect sex workers."
486,Except ... I'm in my 30s and still love travel and learning new things about our world. There's not an age limit on exploration. 
487,"Not filing the restraining order is essentially a favor to her, since she won't have it show up as filed against her. The mother is of course looking out for her child, but after 10 months the favors are simply not there anymore. For this reason I'd also disregard the mother's potential hurt in this.  

The sole factor in whether to file or not should be how you feel about it. If having filed it will bring you peace of mind in the future, then do it.

"
488,"I mean, at this point I would do my best because it's my friend, but tell Pippa that things won't be Pinterest-perfect and she'll just need to accept however the cakes come out. If I'm already there, the kitchen is there, someone is willing to buy ingredients - why not even try? If it's a failure no one but the snobby bride and groom will blame me and like you said, the friendship is definitely on the rocks.

It sounds like everyone else realizes how much the couple dropped the planning ball so I don't think OP is alone in her distaste for how things are going down. "
489,"I never exclusively text the boyfriend on my work phone because I have a personal cell too. You know why? The phone belongs to work! They can take that back at any time. They can look through it, IT does shit to it all the time, it is not secure for romantic texting.

It is odd both that he won't give you his personal phone number, AND that between the two phones he had to give you, he chose the *work* phone over the personal phone. 

Listen, NO ONE here knows if he's cheating but at the very least, I can say, ""That is unusual and makes me mildly suspicious."" "
490,"Yeah... So he shows he is proud by buying her a ton of lingerie, something he never did when she was a bit heavier?

Seems a bit deluded to just assume the things are unrelated.  

Why did he never do any of these nice things BEFORE she lost weight, huh?"
491,"She is married, and she does have a job. Her job completely varies schedule wise. Sometimes it could be as much as 8 hours, or as little as a half hour.

I'll look into the narc sub again and see what might work for me, thank you"
492,"Wut? This isn't some dark secret. What is he going to say if he finds out, years down the line, that she knew he was going to ask? 'Betrayal 4ever, divorce now plz'?"
493,"It's not. Seriously, don't have kids with this guy. You'll never get a moment of rest and you'll end up a resentful mess."
494,"Oh my God. Divorce. 

You already explained all the reasons why you should. And so now all I can do is say that I (though I'm just an internet stranger) support you completely on this.

Even if he's nice to you, you are now aware that he is empty in whatever part of him is supposed to have integrity. 

This is just horrifying.

I hope it comforts you a bit to have even the little bit of support that Reddit can offer. 

Huge huge huge gigantic hugs to you. "
495,Love it when /r/relationships just wants to bash on OP. Great help you're all being what the fuck.
496,"And telling this story from his point of view on RBN, maybe a post titled ""That time my EMom let my NDad an GC sisters make me sleep on the couch for years""

I really hope she steps back and looks at this objectively. She's probably scared of her family's reactions to anything they don't want, so she avoids those conflicts at all costs, that's why she can brazenly admit the daughters take priority. We think it's crazy, but from the inside, it might feel like a survival tactic, the norm for keeping some fragile peace."

503,"It is almost always people with money and status who become kleptomaniacs. Apparently there's not only a sense of entitlement involved, but the sense of being unfulfilled due to having life handed to you rather than earning your own place in life.

Counseling, and if that doesn't work, she can look forward to court dates and a loss of reputation in her society. Kleptomaniacs steal from friends and family, and are slowly frozen out rather than being confronted. 

So counseling, before this destroys her life. HOWEVER. She has to do this. She has to make the appointment, and show up, and keep a notebook of impulses and wins. She needs to acknowledge her own failures and begin returning things *without* making excuses. She has to own the behavior to deal with it.

I come from a long line of lower class kleptos, and it took me from 14yo to my early 20's to stop picking up insignificant little objects. Pens were the last -- it was so hard to stop walking off with pens. The biggest problem was that if I slipped up once, the next couple of times were SO EASY, and it would be much more difficult to control the impulse. "

That's not the type of guy she is going have sex with.  "
512,"Well my condolences, your girlfriend is just really dense after all.

Have you sat her down and said something like:

""Hey, I want to be supportive of you, but I love you and couldn't live with it if something bad happened. Please let someone sit in even if it isn't me so that I feel that you're going to be in a safe environment.""

If she still declines tell her parents and dump her ass because she doesn't give a shit about you or your feelings"
513,"I modeled for many years. Even picked up gigs occasionally on model mayhem (an amateur website) but a common rule of thumb was to NEVER work with a photographer who would deny you an escort. There's simply no good reason for that. 

Best case scenario is this dude is a total wannabe nobody who thinks he's starting his own modeling agency or something. Sounds more like a ""casting couch"" scenario to me though.  "
514,"Great idea!
I'd stay away from the more romantic parts though. Not because they weren't great, but because your relationship is transitioning to a friendship which is the aspect you want to memorialize.

Also, you don't want some future girlfriend of his to find the book,  have a jealous freak out and try to sabotage your friendship.

What's unhealthy is *your relationship with dating*.  Some guy ghosts on you?  Big deal, move on -- clearly it wasn't going to work out anyways.  You talk to someone for a week and the first date sucks?  Oh well, better luck next time -- it wasn't meant to be.

A nice relationship is great, but it's not necessary.  Stop treating it like it's necessary.  Stop acting like you're empty or less without romance.  That's the issue here."

518,"A lot of people feel angry and resentful at 15, and that's okay. I think it's best if you keep it to yourself though and try to understand the choices your parents make. Not everyone is perfect, including adults.

519,"you are absolutely doing the right thing regarding the cat. the guy is a sociopath to not realise that his cat was out of food/water/needed some goddamn attention. when he gets back and sees his cat is gone, you just play dumb 'hey man, i dont know what happened, did it get out? i wondered if maybe you took it to your girlfriends? we havent seen it in a while' that sort of thing. he has no care o idea of how it is so why should he expect you to be on top of it.
but also, you lost your whole deposit because of this dbag, before you even saw the state of his room because of his abandoned cat, he had already basically screwed you. you are more than fine (morally) kicking him out, just make sure you do everything by the book in that regard. but dont let him have the cat back!"

I'm sorry for your loss, OP."
522,"Look, just drop the you vs her mentality for a second.

It's fine if you didn't want to give money to her brother, but in her situation, she felt shitty and like she had no control. 

Do I think she's being a bit unreasonable? Yeah. It's both of your money, not just hers or not just yours. However, this entire situation has shown that's just not really going to work.


So you have 2 options.

1) let her go find her own work. At this point she feels it's the only way she'll have financial agency. If she does this, you can maybe talk out a way that both your pays go a bit to bills and stuff but still leaves you with money to spend/save

2) You apologize for how you acted about her brother. Don't lie, explain that you still felt iffy about lending him the money, but it's not your place to harass her about how she spends her discretionary funds. The entire point of those funds is she can spend them how she wants without question. If you want to support her as a SAHM, that's what it has to be. Doesn't matter if she spends it on a silly clown costume, her brother, or 20kg of sticky notes. 

Some couples can do the ""our funds are OURS"" thing. Me and my boyfriend do exactly that. We discuss all purchases and we're always on board, if we don't want something we've always been able to come to a conclusion about it. My moms needed money in the past and he's been able to say ""that's just not feasible right now"" and I can agree. I've done the same with his parents. We've also successfully given money to our parents when needed. Point is, there was always a discussion were both of us were at a happy agreement. 

However, again, this situation has shown you two CANT, because when a disagreement arises, like a real genuine disagreement that can't just be veto'd away, a happy compromise can't be met. So find a different way to do it from now on. "
523,"Spot on....  I hope the husband or his lawyer reads the ""nice timeline of our relationship"" to use in the divorce proceedings...."
524,"&gt;My BF was sucking on a lollipop and to prove to my family that the love was real, while they were speaking to me, I took the lollipop out of his hand and sucked on it after he had been doing so for a while.

That's sort of a weird thing to do to ""prove your love is real"". Very 10 years old. 

&gt;After my BF left, my parents told me that I should definitely breakup with him or they will disown me.

I'm sorry about that. That's very sad. That said, you can't live your life for anybody else. You can't live your life for your parents. You  have to live for you. And if your relationship with your boyfriend is important to you, then keep living your life. Your parents may make some choices. They may be hurtful choices. But you can't let that influence your choices."

526,"How is this taking away time for himself?

Does her knowing this information somehow take time away? 

He's also a grown up who is capable of controlling all of his various actions.  If he's drinking to the point of forgetting the existence of time then maybe he needs a new hobby. 

Her basic request of a general time in no way effects his ability to have a good time unless he has some mental health issue.

Not only is this a red flag but I would consider it a dealbreaker."
528,Could you get your best man to hold and hide it for you? Or someone else to bring it to you when you need it? She is being a little redicuous about it if she doesn't want you to pass out. I understand she's probably really stressed about planning everything but if she loves you she should be able to comprise about this one thing since it's basically between you having water when you need it or passing out during the wedding.

530,"Your wife felt a painful, traumatic medical procedure should be private. Yes, everyone wants to meet the baby, but the one pushing it out is the one that gets to decide who they want there during the actual process of doing so. 

You were the selfish one here. You ignored your wife's wishes out of your own selfishness, and then you were shocked when the hospital staff stood up to honor her wishes. 

You're the one who owes an apology here, at very minimum. "

534,"In my view, he's shifting the discussion to him being nice and you're telling him not to be nice, which makes you sound unreasonable.

The truth is that you have asked him not to do x, and he is doing x. He is doing something you have explicitly asked him not to do.

*girl kisses you, giggles, kisses you again, says see you soon, you ask her to see her again, she says yes with an emoji


""I don't think she's interested""



She is, dude. Nice!"
538,Definitely wouldn't make me sad. I told him before I went to sleep that he wasn't allowed to do it anymore. 
539,"It is absolutely abusive. My issue is that without feedback I havent known specifically how to change and work through my own issues. Hoping for details when he and I talk tonight. 

I am treating my bipolar... on antipsycotics antianxiety pills and a pill for energy and concentration.. abilify, lyrica and vyvanse are the names. And I just stopped an antidepressant 2 months ago.  See my psychiatrist monthly, a nurse whenevrr I need to talk between those sessions and am doing weekly CBT specifically for Bipolar. Also in anger management as of this week."
540,"&gt;I want her to be happy and I know I can't give her that happiness, so I actually wish she would meet another man who would fulfill those needs she has.

She gets to decide what makes her happy. You get to decide what makes you happy. If you aren't happy in the marriage...leave. If you aren't happy with yourself, get some help and work on that."
541,"Oh holy hell girl. Dump him already. You are making this a huge deal and I think it's obvious you're not gonna get over it. He deserves someone who is attracted to him, it's clearly not you. Move on. "

543,"My ex was a very smart man. He was incredibly artistically talented and knew how to program, had many interests and was successful in them. Now, I am smart and successful and have many interests and talents as well, but when we were talking about the things he was interested in I felt like I couldn't really keep up and was just there to listen and learn. I didn't feel dumb, but I certainly felt less educated and less interesting. 

Thing was, as brilliant as he was if he wasn't talking about a subject he was highly educated in, the dude was awkward as crap and came off as either uninterested or unintelligent. We didn't talk a lot about the many things I have a lot of knowledge in because it made him feel inferior. 

The reality was we were smart about different things. I'm quite socially adept, write well, love psychology and astronomy, and lots of other things. He was incredible with computers and music and puzzles and such. Neither were dumb, but if you measure someone's intelligence by what you're interested in and not what they're passionate about then they're obviously not going to seem very smart. 

Your girlfriend seems like a great, intelligent, passionate person. You should consider yourself lucky. "
544,"Your taking note of her each and every move is really creepy, dude. Just saying. Just approach her if you're interested and talk to her."
545,"So long as you stick in your denial that this could be your _wife's_ perception, and your _Wife's_ reality instead of yours, you won't be able to fix it.

Your intentions don't matter right now, because to your *wife* this is her truth. This is her reality. THIS is how she interpreted the situation. regardless of how you meant it, this is what is real to her and her feelings are valid. You need to swallow your pride and tell your denial to shove it and attend to your wife."
546,"This was my first thought, I hope OP reads this. Sounds like mom is the one pushing for sister's involvement, but would sister even want to be involved? The pushiness around other aspects of the wedding only proves that mom is unreasonable and doesn't think twice about others' wants/needs.

I'm not excusing your sister's behavior (because there could be relevant details left out), but she may deserve a little empathy for the state of her life. Be thankful that you were able to overcome your issues and learn life skills/meet a husband, whereas your sister might live the rest of her life miserably under mom's thumb.

"
547,Do not do this. It will come off as extremely passive aggressive and condescending. 
548,"I ""quit"" about 10 years ago. Quote marks because I've had a cigarette here and there since. My last almost 2 years ago. There are days I walk by smokers and it stinks, and others days the aroma is intoxicating.  Just keep one day at a time."

550,"&gt;I just want you to be happy, you deserve to be happy, even if it's not with me. Likewise, I would hope to have the freedom, if someone else came along and we had a better connection than you and I, that you would be happy for me.

Kinda sounds like she's not as into you as you are into her and she wants to let you know that she's keeping her options open.

If it were me, I want to be someone's first choice and not their backup plan."
551,Good advice. Also upvote because you made me laugh.

See if you can get ahold of a decibel meter, and maybe a decent mic (you may be able to rent these from a specialty shop?), then take a video of the decibel meter and record the sound. Be sure to timestamp the video. The really ridiculous, obviously purposeful noise sessions especially! 

Also keep a written journal/log of all loud noise (time, types of sounds, etc) and interactions. Include all the details you included in your post. Include anything you remember prior to the day you start the log as well.

Part of me wants you to leave the evidence on their front doorstep. No threats, if anything just a note of ""Please try to keep it down? Thank you!"" I don't know if that's a strategically smart approach here, as there may be laws about recording someone without their permission. I don't know if they exist in your country, or if they would apply in this particular situation.

ETA: Let your landlord know that the problem is continuous and you're documenting everything. Keep them aware of the issue. Also, if your neighbors are calling in hysterical complaints, it can't hurt to be the sane, reasonable ones with evidence in a situation that could come down to your word against theirs."
555,"Yeah, but then she has her answer and can break up with him and move on. If she asks him to propose he can say he's going to do it but then procrastinate like the last time they had the conversation. "
556,"He could be a great partner, a great person...but some flaws are a 'bigger deal' than other flaws.  In a relationship, it's a partnership - you have to think about both needs plus kids, if any. Any decision that impacts both parties has to be AGREED upon by both.  You didn't agree to support 2 people on your one income.  He needs to look for a paid full-time job, and then he can do his passion project on the side. 


Do note that money is one of the top 3 reasons couples get divorced.  And unfortunately, his lack of responsibility to the relationship and earning income doesn't bode well for your future together. "
557,"I got pregnant at around your age when my birth control failed, right at the end of a rocky relationship. We were broken up already when I found out (doctor called after my physical, and I don't recall why they even ran the test), and I knew immediately that I wasn't going to carry it to term.

Like you, I felt very calm about it, scheduled an appointment for an abortion, and contacted my ex after the date was set to let him know. I didn't expect anything from him -- he'd told me that a doctor had said he couldn't have kids (not sure if this actually happened), and I just wanted him to know that wasn't the case so he could be careful in the future. He called me every name in the book and accused me of cheating before giving my number to his new girlfriend, who did the same. Due to the stress, I had a miscarriage about a week before my appointment.

I had some feelings of sadness (probably because of the harassment and hormones), but mostly of overwhelming relief. I knew what the right choice was for me, and if I hadn't miscarried, I would have gone through with the abortion, without question. I hope I never have to go through a miscarriage during a wanted pregnancy, but years later, I consider it to have been the best thing that could have happened to me in that situation. I have no regrets, no shame, and no guilt about any of it.

What it comes down to is this:

You make the right choice for you. Feel the emotions that you feel. Your experience is your experience, and there isn't one right way to do this. Lastly, you may want to look into a more reliable, long-term method of birth control while you can still get it. I now have a hormonal IUD, which lasts for 5 years and has a success rate of 99.9%.

You can get through this! I believe in you and am sending you love. &lt;3"
558,"We got engaged because I still had blinders on, if you will. It was only when we moved in together that I noticed that she wasn't changing and wasn't putting any effort. "
559,"There are lots of ways to do this, but you both need to be comfortable with the plan. Proportionate contributions is absolutely normal and appropriate, especially as your wage discrepancy is so great. 

Are you planning to be together and maintain this arrangement forever? If you do, then over the long run the  impact of 50/50 on her finances will be much greater than on yours.

 You're in your thirties, are you investing in a partnership or a casual relationship? How does she see the relationship? 50/50 is more often (but not always) used when there's an element of convenience or lack of commitment. What if you have a child? Whose income will determine your spending habits? These are all questions more important than the specific %s.

In case it's relevant, my partner makes 60% of what I do, and I have significant savings whereas he has little. We live together and have a relaxed approach to money--it's all used in service of the life we want to live together, even though my personal accounts have more in them and I maintain a separate financial identity alongside our shared one. If he had to pay 50% of everything we couldn't afford to do all the things we/I want to, and I'd be accruing tens of thousands of dollars outside our relationship, setting up even more of a difference between us. We are in it for the long haul, so this is intuitive and easy. My previous relationships were never so definite or serious, so we went 50/50.

561,"Unfortunately, these kind of people take politeness as weakness. The more reasonable and willing to compromise you appeared, the more they thought you weren't deserving of any consideration. 

Now, this is not to mean you're in the wrong, because you aren't. It's just that with these kind of bullies you almost have to do the opposite of what normal social interaction dictates is right. Don't feel bad that you weren't able to handle them, most people would probably make the same mistake, at least the first time. Take it as a learning experience. "
562,"Yep, all of my doctors and nurses told me the only implant-related pregnancies occured because of incorrect implantation or because of the implant migrating somewhere else in the body (apparently can happen in overweight people)."

Even though 60+ years ago the world was a different place, that career path doesn't make a whole lot of sense. You say you've seen some of his financials... does he have tons of liquid assets? If so, why is he living alone in a basic apartment?

I feel for the old guy, and his situation is probably what I fear most in life. But I don't trust this situation-- and I'm a lawyer."
568,"This gets worse with every comment! Your SO sounds like someone you need to get the hell away from immediately. He's tried to wound you in front of friends, massively violated your trust and privacy, was intensely creepy and intimidating when he revealed said violation, is trying to gaslight you into thinking you're the person at fault, and is also trying to convince you that he's the only one with the power/right to decide to end the relationship. That's a whole field of red flags! Please don't wait around for any more. "

It's amazing that the BC that you need has a $0.00 copay -- I know that spending $80.00 a month on that was a financial stress. I'm a little confused though, because I gave you the $120.00 today, and you didn't mention this change. I'm not mad about the money, but I'm concerned about our communication. Can I hear your side of this whole situation? I'd love to talk about it like a team, so we can figure out what's goin' on.""

This sounds way more submissive than you feel, I know that. But if you have any chance of hearing something resembling the truth, this framing will be useful for you. Take a picture of the receipt so you have it when she tries taking it away."
571,Dump him. He is attempting to guilt and berate you into a sexual act that you don't want to do. He has zero respect for you and is treating you like crap. Why would you want a boyfriend like that?
572,"OP, he's doing this because right now, everything in his life sucks and it feels good to him to be a victim.  If he breaks up with you, he's not the victim.  If you break up with him, he IS the victim.  

He's literally begging you to break up with him:

&gt; and to do something for himself and be selfish for once.

and

&gt; He then tells me that I need to focus on myself and doing what I want and my own career (which is true)

I mean...he pretty much did everything except say the words ""We're breaking up.""  He wants you to do it to help further justify his phase he's in, and the unfortunate reality is that there's nothing you can do about it, so your best choice is to let him do it.  Even if he snaps out of it, who knows when it'll happen again?  Do you really want to sit around wondering when his next ""episode"" will be?  "
573,"Because you do not have the same experience as a woman his age. I know you may be 'mature' but at 20 you are still new to dating and relationships.  

A man that age can't relate to women his age. I am 32 and would be grossed out to date a guy who is 20. But you will not listen, so good luck to you and learn from it."

Get involved with a career counselor and a recruitment firm. Most jobs aren't advertised, so you need an insider to help you. "

That said,we aren't mind readers. Ask him if he wants to date you,he probably does."
578,"Obviously it is not minor because the OP is upset about it. Feasibly, a woman will have her period monthly (give or take depending on her birth control, etc all) until her late 30s at the earliest. Should she expect be treated this way, monthly, until then? No. It's juvenile of him. He's a child because he treats her like she is ""icky"" - she' not. "

Not I get to pick the location of our wedding, which will have monumental meeting, and you can choose the location over our wedding vacation."
581,You shouldn't be. But it does mean that maybe you don't get to have a kid and a personal chauffeur/wife.
582,She's a cheater and manipulator. I wouldn't want a person like that as my friend. I'd help the boyfriend and show him the logs so he knows the right thing is to leave her and she can't lie to cover all of those. She doesn't love him or you. She doesn't deserve either of you. That's some karma for her.  
583,"&gt;The guys I used to date...the ones that would take days to text back, the ones who'd stop talking to me cuz they met someone new, the ones who dismissed my feelings completely...I'm already emotionally damaged by it 

That's an unhealthy relationship with dating.

Have you ever spent any time just...single?  Not dating?"
584,You can never be too careful...
585,"&gt; ~~In her mind~~Legally, it was her money to spend, but you got mad at her anyway.

586,"Are you honestly that ignorant? Are you seriously unaware of the fact that women's sexual desires are often overlooked? Are you aware that women used to be treated for ""hysteria"" on the basis of having sexual desires, which were seen as aberrant and abnormal in women?

I mean, look, I could give you the history lesson. But are you HONESTLY telling me this is something you've never seen/noticed before? You've never noticed that men are expected to be sexual and horny, while women are expected to be ""gatekeepers"" of sex, or to use sex as a means of achieving other ends (like stable romantic relationships)? You've never noticed that we talk about men as the agents of sex and women as the recipients? (Think about how often we say ""he fucked her"" vs. ""she fucked him."" If you don't believe me, Google both of those phrases and see the # of hits for each.)

I get that you're probably anti-feminist and don't acknowledge that sexism exists, but can you really tell me that you've NEVER seen this gendered standard play out in your life, in the media, in conversation, ever?"
587,"Assuming her friends are around the same age as her, why does your wife need to provide contraceptives to 40 year old adult women? "
588,"Some corrections. We didn't have definite plans, we had ""tentative plans"" but its still impolite imo to keep someones day on hold while they wait for no update for 12 hours.

And her phone was dead after 630 I guess, but I checked messenger at 8 cause by 8pm I was like ""Okay wtf is up what are we doing"". She got out of work at 7, and didnt get home till 840 I guess.

Ive brought up this issue twice. "
589,This HAS to be a troll account 
590, Assuming the lady hasn't said anything to his wife either his wife may not want to stay friends. It seems kind of creepy the way she inserted her way into his life.

You need to be consistent with this because he will use every trick in the bad from threats of self harm to breaking up with you, he will be as hurtful as he can be.
You call him the next day, if he decides to give you the silent treatment you respect that, once he talks with you like a normal person again you keep on with the relationship. If he has another tantrum you cut the skype again and the calls. When he talks to you, you bring up therapy.

Second: Next time you're at dinner, just say, ""By the way, I feel that now I should mention that I have Asperger's."" And then just go back to talking about TV shows, preferably ones that aren't Big Bang Theory. If she asks why just say that it didn't seem important at the time. If she gets irrationally angry, find someone else. Almost no one really cares about Asperger's as a relationship deterrent, you'll find someone else without much difficulty."

599,"I mean... that wasn't ""just"" a slap on the butt. That wasn't violating parenting rules. He hit a 4year old with a belt! That's child abuse plain and simple. I would call the police and never let him come near my kid again. "
600,"Look, I was spanked as a kid, but what your dad did wasn't spanking.  It was BEATING.  Your. Child. Was. Beaten. Why are you being so passive and letting everybody else fight it out over YOUR own child?  You are a father and it's cowardly to offer your own child up as a literal whipping post just so you can keep the peace with mommy and daddy.

&gt;My parents are my parents, I owe them so much and can't bare the thought of never seeing them again.

Then you go visit your parents by yourself.  But they should no longer have access to your child, especially not unsupervised access.  And if your parents are upset at not seeing their grandchild, you let them know that's on your father.  Don't let them make your wife the bad guy here when she is rightfully looking out for the wellbeing of your child."

I really can't explain to you the massive amount of intricacies that are part of raising children. If you do have children in the future, and I hope you do, you may look back on your comment as quite a bit naive. It's akin to armchair quarterbacking. "
605,"Those aren't traits.

No one stays super hot. That's a temporary condition some humans happen to have. 

Liking death metal is an interest, and interests change often. Picking a partner because of this is shallow. 

Liking crappy horror movies is even more shallow. 

"
606,"You are incredibly brave and strong. Your daughter is lucky to have a mom with such positive traits. 

It is not like you could have foreseen any of this happening. When something this serious happens the mind starts to wonder. ""Maybe if I just"" or ""If I did x then surely y wouldn't of happened"". The truth is you can't really know something like that. Nobody can predict the future, anything could of happened there. 

You know what we do know though? You had the strength to recognize you were in an abusive relationship and you took action to get out of it. That is highly commendable. Getting back together with him would have been a bad decision for you and your daughter considering his drug problems and the way he treated you.

I'm so sorry for your loss and I understand how you feel about it. Keep on kicking ass with your daughter!"
607,For something that should be a platonic relationship between a parent and her kid's sports coach - it absolutely is a lot. 
608,"Yeah that's pretty fucked up on it's own.

Like that's cruel to her CHILD. Telling his dad he can't come - if I was her kid (obv I'm older but still) I would be LIVID and DISGUSTED with my mother if she tried to prevent my father from taking interest in my life for zero valid reasons.
"
609,"At the same time, he did say they don't know how far along they are which, if they'd literally only had sex once (or only in the past month or something) they'd have a pretty good idea. "

614,"Is your boyfriend easily persuaded by people? You really have to get at the source of where the doubt comes from. Did he have it and the friend brought it out? Or was he confident but persuaded otherwise? 

As for the actual planning of things, even simple weddings get stupidly complicated. Keep a consistent view of your core values, how small you want it to be, who you want to be there, the low-pressure mood, etc. The actually setting may change, but don't let the core change. and if he is the one making the changes, he should put in the work to address the changes."

621,"She knows what having a baby is. She said she is done. You have literally NO reason to think she doesnt know what she wants on this subject. 

I understand you are in love. And because of that temporary insanity, you kinda think, that you and she are so awesome she's going to change her mind and want to mix dna with you and have a third child. Just give it time?

If you need her to tell you again. Ask her point blank but this time, try to dig deep in that love filled heart of yours, and find the respect it takes to believe she knows her own mind on the subject."
622,"Think about it. He really liked her, and for once thought he might have a chance with someone he really liked... she rejects him, and now the truth comes out. That's why he is having this type of reaction to it. 

I would never stay with someone who literally treats me like second best "
623,Jesus.  It's been years and he's been quite clear that he doesn't give a single flying fuck about your comfort in your own damn house.  It affects more than just him and he's being a selfish baby about it.  I imagine you have a lease but I'd try to get out of there ASAP cause if you still think he's ever gonna change you're being delusional.  Sorry if that's harsh but he literally has been this way from day one.  It ain't gonna get better.  
624,"First off, friend-zoned isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Three of my four best friends are women and they can be a powerful ally.  They are great to bounce these types of questions off of and are eager to help bridge the male/female gap.  My (girl)friends have helped me out tremendously with picking up women.  Plus, they may have single friends and will put in a good word for you.  I would HIGHLY recommend having women friends.

Now on to your point.  You have to be somewhat clear about your intentions early on.  Do a little flirting and see how they respond.  If you are always their friend and there for them, that's kinda how they see you.  It takes a little bit of effort to learn how to flirt without coming off as a skeaze.  Just try not to act desperate...women can sense that a mile away and it is a turnoff.  Just be kind, confident and funny.  Not every girl will be into you, so don't take rejection personally."
625,"Then she said I told our daughter she can have sex, which isn't really true, all I said was ""you have to practice safe sex"" and apparently thats 'encouraging' our daughter to have sex??? 

As an outsider, you did say she could have sex. That's not encouraging her.

What was your wife like before that to both yourself and your daughter? She seems like a nightmare"

627,"You would be surprised at what deficiencies can do. B12 deficiency, can in some cases causes some psychosis.

My advice to you is this:

1. Never say things just to hurt the other person. Remember, you can't take back what is already said.

2. Listen to his point of view, try to understand where he is coming from.

3. Never go to bed angry. Even if you have to stay up until 6am, reconcile the issue. That advice in particular is the best advice I have ever received about being in a relationship. It has truly helped in relationships.

Good luck, I hope you two have many happy years together. "
632,"&gt;  it's because the players are sexist.

This, by extension, would mean that D&amp;D culture is sexist

Not that I agree that D&amp;D *does* have a sexist culture in general, but you can't say ""it's not the culture, it's the people!"" because the culture *is* the people."
633,"And if it doesn't last a week, then so what? It's not your problem if he'll end up with no clothes to wear."
634,"Three times is at least two times too many.

I've been with my boyfriend going on five years and neither of us has called the other any sort of name, ever, no matter what. Even when we are frustrated with or mad at each other, we love and respect each other enough that we would never say something specifically to hurt the other person, which is what name calling is. "
635,That's not what *susceptible* means at all
636,"I find your worldview is rather sad. You think so little of your SO - that him merely having female friends means he is going to be hurt, manipulated, etc, like he is some helpless child and will be overwhelmed by female attention. You think so little of your gender - that all girls lack respect for your relationship and are focused on competing for your SO's affections. 

You're went to the US for school, right? Studying overseas isn't just limited to what's in textbooks and tests, it's also about expanding your worldview - understanding that not everyone believes the same thing as you do, and more importantly people who don't share your ""values"" aren't automatically wrong. "
637,"It occurs to me that her dr may have okayed her having a bit more time on her feet by *spring* whereas she is not medically released to go yet.  And going to a few parties, where she can sit down if need be is not the same as indulging in a lot of hiking and exploring out in nature where there is not a hotel or bed nearby.  So talk with her about how disappointed you are you and she can travel together, but cut her some slack, imho."
638,"Yeah, I'd break up with him. He's certainly not looking for friendship on Tinder, and just the fact he had the app is ridiculous. Leave him, he cheated on you or still is."
639,"Does she throw parties for everyone else in the office? Just because your birthday is close to Jack's, that doesn't automatically mean that any celebration for Jack has to include you. She's throwing a party because she's dating this guy, not because he is her employee. If everyone else in the office also gets birthday parties and you don't, then you have a leg to stand on to feel excluded. Otherwise, you really need to move past this."
640,"I agree about everything else in your comment except talking to the guy. I think it's pretty disrespectful to discuss your feelings for someone when they're in a relationship. Because what are they supposed to do with that information? 

I think OP should talk about it with someone but not the guy he has feelings for who's in a relationship."
641,"Oh my god... I just noticed. It's been several years since I dropped 130lbs and, I don't even notice stairs anymore. No heavy breathing, no strain. How could I have forgotten that already?"
642,"I'd do what 8livesdown suggests, using her script. I think you will feel a lot better if you communicate that to her. "
643,"Dude, it's great that you can use music to sort out your feelings,  but it's not the best way to communicate.   Communication goes 2 ways, and giving her a song is purely unidirectional.  That's probably what is frustrating your gf.
     
You don't have to be good at talking,  that will come with time.   You do, however, have to talk to her.  
   
My suggestion is to write out your song and figure out what you want to say,  then instead of playing the song,  tell her what you figured out you wanted to say.

Welcome to adulthood. "
644,He suggests a woman's breasts can be worked so hard that they give up. It anthropomorphizes them. It's not hilarious but it's obviously a joke that makes no sense taken literally.
645,"Tell him this. Exactly this. Seriously. Im not intending that rudely. He needs to realize that this is a grown ups life and literally exactly what you were working towards. Unless he makes enough that you can quit your job and live the carefree life with him and thats what you want to do he needs to be made aware that you have an issue with his behavior and he needs to realize that you are grownups now. 

Edit: Also suggest that he get hobbies outside the house while you're at work.  He is obviously feeling lonely now, but he needs to work that out himself. You guys can't be together 24-7."
646,"Exactly. She's not going to go to the store to get junk food if she can barely move around the house. Fill the house with baked/grilled chicken, fish, and vegetables. And they definitely both need assistance with it for sure. But right now it would be fairly simple to make healthier food. Lots of easy recipes for oven-baked chicken, almost as simple as putting a pizza in the oven. 
"
647,"Ding, ding, ding! Clearly these people know that if they keep being aggressive toward OP's boyfriend he will crack and bend to meet their will, because it's fairly obvious that this is a known flaw of his. "
648,"So many questions! 

How come you live with your brother? 20 is really on the young side to be responsible for a kid, sounds like he fucked up. 

What's your health insurance situation? Was he trying to avoid the expense, or are you  covered?

You want out? Are there other relatives who can take you in? 

Sorry about your wrist. Hope you heal quickly."
649,"You think insurance will pay for that? I don't. So now a 20 year old who, because of inevitably shitty life circumstances, has ended up the guardian of his 13 year old brother, will be on the hook for $700 in addition to the $2500+ cost for the ER, unless they have no deductible insurance, which seems very unlikely."
650,Yeah what did the uber driver do?
651,"Adolescence is actually ages 16-24. Your hormones are closer to a 14 year old than a 36 year old.

So the example is still good."
652,"Wow, don't you think this is jumping the gun just a bit? Video chatting those girls was a mistake, but she said that was months ago and that he has been acting perfectly since. He recognized how hurt she was and refuses to do it again because of that. Again, it was a mistake to begin with, but from the information we have there is no reason that she should ""dump the untrustworthy loser and find a new person.""

"
653,"Oh, honey. You are okay, he just wasn't the right person for you to start trying with. I think being straightforward about it is the right thing to do, that guy just wasn't right.

Have you thought about talking to a therapist?"
654,"People also change too, and there is a chance that him staying with her was a way of him slowly pulling away from those friends. Which may be something they're starting to resent, hence them saying that to her."
655,"At this pace, he might be able to tie his own shoes in two or three years!

I'm exaggerating, but that is an *extremely* low standard for a 30 year old."
656,"Do you know how many guys I've heard actually say this, while I fully know that the girl they just slept with told me that she faked it to boost his ego/for convenience? Come on, I'm sorry but you're not a sex god who's above all men in this regard "
657,"Well, is there actually going to be a good time to talk to you about this stuff? Because she followed your request, and now you're upset that she didn't do something (wait longer) that you didn't ask her to do. But based on your schedule, this is going to mess up your sleep or your day off. Is there anyway to reduce the amount of work you do so you can actually be an emotional support to your wife?"
658,"It's quite normal not to be able to move on quickly after seven years together, especially since he dumped you. And even more since you're still living together. I don' think you'll be able to truly move on unless one of you moves out."
659,How about turning the tv off and taking your daughter to the park so your wife can sleep?
660,"As someone who will be marrying their SO of 8 years this year, thank you for this. I was excited before and this just makes it all the better. 

Hope you and your wife are doing well! "
661,"Exactly this. This is the top comment for a reason. Dude, about a year ago I went through almost the same setup with my fiancee at the time. She started to get cold, no matter what I did, no matter how I tried to re-spark our relationship, it seemed there was nothing I could do to make her happy. I found out she was cheating with a co-worker when we were together. I found out a bit after we broke up. I had to live with her about another 3 months before I could move out. Needless to say, we were set to get married and I had already paid 2 grand into a wedding I couldn't get my money back from.

I'm not going to bore you with the rest of the bullshit that I had to go through but there was two things I learned about my whole ordeal you seem to be overlooking.

The first is my girl stated the reason for the cheating and coldness was exactly what you said. ""you stopped being so affectionate to her and didn't do all the little things you did at the beginning so she felt like you weren't giving her enough attention"". I blamed myself for a while after these things were said but then I thought, just as you should, why then was she throwing your attention away when you were blatantly trying to give it to her before you found out? What did she do in the past 6 months (ask yourself) that showed she as giving YOU attention? Remember a relationship is a two-way street.

You aren't the only one who's supposed to control the amount of attention you two give each other. She also didn't explicitly say anything to you or even try to have a long talk with you about it. She just went and cheated with a co-worker instead. Now ask yourself, would you have ever done that to her and given the same excuses? Or would you have done something about it way before it came to that? Don't let her lie to you, she cheated just because she was BORED OF YOU BUT DIDN'T TRY TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT FROM HER SIDE EITHER. She's using all of that as an excuse to make her seem like the victim. That's not what a relationship should be.

2nd. She seemed to love the fact she was hurting you and seeing you a wreck. The three months I had to live with her still were absolutely miserable. It's a lot harder for us guys to get rebounds than women. She would do the same thing and just smile at my misery. Is that someone you want to go back to? Would you EVER, EVER, SMILE when she was broken down crying her eyes out because she didn't give you enough affection? Please think about that. Relationships are a two way street, and I realized after this past year moving back to my home state (yes i Moved 1200 miles for her) that this was the case. She really wasn't the person I completely thought she was and she hid a lot of motives and a lot of who she truly was from me over the relationship. I feel like the same thing is happening to you. As much as it hurts, and as much as you don't want to hear this. She will do it again. The only thing I can say is the next time it will be your fault. This time it wasn't. Don't forget that man."
662,"Is there a way to lighten your wife's workload? You know the food isn't the real issue. She may be more open to the swim team if it wasn't just another thing being added to her plate. Sadly your son is paying for her being overwhelmed. Hire a cleaner to come in once a week. It doesn't cost as much as most people think and will take a huge amount of work off of her mind. Hire someone to cook and freeze meals for you do that dinner isn't always on her mind. Or find a grocery delivery service to drop off food so that your wife doesn't have to shop. It's a bit more expensive, but definitely not outrageous. Once her workload drops, talk to her about how enriching a sport could be for your son. It would be a shame for him to miss out. "
663,"I think you kind of need to separate your issue with your husband from your issue with the sister. Firstly, you need to talk to your husband about how it makes you feel when he continuously minimizes how she's treated you. Once you guys work through that you'll probably have an easier time deciding what to do about her. You definitely need to have that conversation with him."
664,"im really glad for your personal feelings on it, and that your brother can at least consciously acknowledge that your sister is blameless. 

you seem like you're taking the right baby steps to maybe one day be the bridge between your brothers and sister at least, and i commend you for it. keep trucking, and i hope you have many long years with all of your family."
665,"If he were ""just friendly"" he'd be doing it to everyone, men included. And why would ""just friendly"" include trying to find out if OP is single?"
666,Goodness yes file it!  Best case scenario she leaves you alone and no harm done.  Worst case she continues and now you're protected legally. 
667,"You've tried the subtle approach.  Hasn't worked.  Gotta pull out the big guns.  Time to Hurt Some Feelings.

Get a picture of him when you started dating and take a picture of him now.  There should be a clear difference unless he is completely delusional.  Sit him down and tell him that he clearly is letting himself go and that lip service about working out ain't cutting it.

You have to get him on the same page as you.  He probably thinks it's fine and this is something you'll get used to.  I seriously doubt you've relayed to him that you're reaching the point where you no longer find him sexually attractive.  For a couple that's about to get married, that's A Problem.

So yeah.  Regardless of whether or not the solution winds up being losing 10, 20, 30, 100 pounds you BOTH need to be aware of what's at stake here and how serious this is.  The time for watching out for feelings is coming to an end if this is something you truly cannot live with going forward.  

EDIT: Just a thought, but it may be worth investigating whether or not your BF is suffering from depression.  If that's the case, this may require a bit more work and understanding than just you having him cut out the high calorie lunches.  I don't know your fiance, but a few details kinda rang out with depression as a possible culprit.  Something to look out for."
668,"I've given men chance after chance after chance hoping they'd change, hoping they'd realize how they were hurting me. It never happened. Instead they wound up breaking my heart. 

It's really difficult leaving because you think he'll change if he has one more chance.  But you can't help someone if he doesn't want to help himself."
669,"Dude.. i don't know these people but i can guarantee you that her parents are not done grieving. They are not on the road to recovery. In fact, get ready, there is no such thing as recovery. Not for them and not for her. When you lose someone you always will have lost them. When your gf is  86 year old and is meeting her great grandkid or accepting her nobel prize or is just watching something funny on tv she will still have that giant hole in her life where her BROTHER used to be. She will always miss him. She will always grieve for him. She will always have a bother who disappeared without a trace. And if she sees his dead body and is convinced that he truly is gone then she will always have a bother who went missing and was later found to be dead. This will never not have happened to her or to him or to their family. Encourage her to seek support from family, friends, and a support group because you clearly can't give it to her. "
670,"It's a switch, he's right. Sorry for the confusion. You pull up to engage it. "
671,stop spouting bollocks.
672,"&gt; How is him teaching her the right way reinforcing doing it wrong with mom?

Consistancy is actually really important for kids. If there's one set of rules for mom, and another for dad, that's a great recipe for some third worse scenario to play out. OP and his wife being on the same page is pretty important. "
673,[deleted]
674,"Are you sure? Cause she's asking to have his babies and describing him as ""perfect"" in detailed reasoning. Looks, smarts, all that. You're sure she doesn't want him? Cause I wouldn't talk about a man being ""perfect"" in every way and wanting to have his babies if I didn't feel something a lot stronger."
675,Yeah but she specifically said she doesn't drink.
676,[deleted]
677,"It's what i have been doing, then after today and last night i was just floored by how far they are willing to take it."
678,"This is like asking the best way to pull the pin on a hand grenade.  You gotta do what you gotta do, but don't kid yourself that there aren't going to be hurt people and permanently ruined relationships in the aftermath.  The best advice I can give is to be honest with your fiance and your own family, and diplomatic with friends and his family."
679,I think cancelling the wedding is something you reserve for *after* you tell him how you feel and asking him to make changes.
680,It was a criminal issue the minute he tried to force his hand up her shirt. They should have called the police the minute she got home from this encounter. They could be weeks ahead of it by now.
681,"&gt; I don't feel like me smoking a bowl with him justifies him not paying for anything. 

It's not that it does or doesn't justify it, it's that in his immature little mind, his contribution is sharing his supply with you. The goal here is to clarify and remove some of the fog from your relationship as far as responsibilities go. I don't think anyone here legitimately thinks that providing weed is a viable contribution to a household, but he might....which means any discussion you have is going to come back to that. As such, get ahead of him and remove that from the bargaining table for now so he can't turn back around and go ""Well, I provide weed to smoke"", even if it's a poor excuse. "
682,"Agreed. He's coming out of rehab, and probably has a poor and/or limited set of social, relationship, and emotional intelligence (for lack of a better term) skills and non-addict advice doesn't exactly translate to the situation at hand (trying to rationalize his guilt over his addiction vs. his girlfriend's infidelity - they aren't even remotely comparable). 

He needs to speak to either an addiction specialist or go to a meeting (SMART, AA, NA, whatever). 

"
683,"I don't think she is being creepy about your deafness. I think she is being creepy about YOU, and at this point, using your deafness as an excuse to be close to you.

Between the hugs, Youtube, inserting herself into your life, and asking personal questions, it 100% sounds like she has a crush on you. I think it would be a good idea to go to a supervisor and list everything you just listed here, because I have honestly never heard of a student / teacher relationship of this nature and if you have concerns, you would do well to address them before YOU somehow accidentally get into trouble."
684,"&gt;I don't like any of his female friends and I don't want him to hang out with them, some of them seem very possessive of him, like they think he belongs to them and I don't like that.

You are projecting. In fact, you are very possessive of him. If he were posting here, I would tell him to dump you. Since you're posting instead, I would recommend you seek help from a therapist and learn how to deal with your insecurity in a healthier manner. It is not okay to try to control your partner."
685,[removed]
686,"Wow. I actually totally get this. I don't want to delve into my relationship and hijack your post but my BF just came out recently and is having issues/finding himself as well.

I think the problem that we may have is we rushed too fast and fell too hard for guys that are at a different phase of their coming out process/life. 

Though he may have known he was gay and liked you for years, he is now just coming to terms with it. It sounds like the separation, the change in family dynamics, figuring himself out, and a new relationship is all a little much for him. 

Like my situation, you just need to give him space, give him time. It's going to suck that you won't constantly be hanging out or hearing from him, but you need to give him space to figure things out. I'm not saying you should totally ignore him, just send him a couple of messages and ask how he is, support him if he needs it.

If you hang out, I wouldn't try to make it or force it to be intimate or romantic. Just let the time be natural. It may take some time but he will figure it all out and hopefully you be there/be available when he does. But right now I don't think he needs a relationship but more of a good friend. Good luck and cheer up!"
687,"Nope, it's no one's job to protect their SO from other suitors. It's that person's job to protect themselves and say, ""Hey, I'm taken."""
688,"Nah, if you were man most of us would still think you're a controlling sexist. Gender has nothing to do with it. 

Some women, like men, have bad intentions because some people have bad intentions. This still does not make it okay at all to try to wrap your boyfriend in a completely woman-free bubble for the rest of your life because you are too lazy and selfish to deal with the bad behaviors of a few people in a mature way. "
689,"If they want half because you have 0 living expenses then they shouldn't be adding on the cost of food (unless they're just saying that you should pay for food when you go out and they'll still pay for food in the house, which is valid)"
690,"THIS. I tried to do the same thing with my boyfriend--we both clean the messes we make, but that turned into a reason to say ""I didn't make that mess so not my responsibility."" If you don't want the dinner dishes to be your responsibility, then cook your own food. But if there are some things that are being treated like teamwork, then follow through like it's teamwork. My ideal has always been how my parents handled things: mom cooks dinner, dad and the kids do clean up. You don't treat family like  you treat a messy roommate. "
691,"Your wife has lost her ability to control herself, and is behaving as if she is the only law of the land. Screaming and issuing threats against the family is much worse than what your 17 year old daughter has done.

There is going to be many more times that your daughter is going to need advice over the next 10 years, (educational, relationship, career) and by your wife reacting with such a low ability to behave like a functional adult, would give me great concern for your daughter and her future.

Parenting is more than screaming and issuing edicts. A 17 year old should have conversations with her parents, not screaming insults and threats.

For your daughter and her mental health, ask for a separation. Ask your wife to leave. Maybe she can move in with a member of the church? Force your wife into counseling. She should be told this behavior is abuse. And furthermore you are not going to stand by and watch her abuse the household. It's get help or divorce. 

"
692,"Yeah, it sounds like she thinks rehab is a camp for unruly teens. "
693,"How about you take responsibility for your life instead of putting it on women. 

You need to decide who you want to be. What are your life goals, what do you want to do with your career and free time? What do you want to achieve? Who do you want to be in 1 year, 2 years, 10 years, 30 years? Surround yourself with people that reflect and support the you that you are and want to be. If you know what you want, you won't be asking the internet (or unsuspecting women) to make your path for you, you'll be forging your own. "
694,"Even if she were charging rent, if OP's an American she falls into the following category:

""single-family housing rented without the use of advertising or without a real estate broker, as long as the landlord owns no more than three such homes at any one time ""

She's exempt from federal antidiscrimination laws, so yes she absolutely can deny her friend and the baby she's choosing to have based on family status."
695,"Car did not get registered. He was unmedicated with severe ADHD for a long time, and lots of things got really screwed up by his default choices. So I did step in, to save our relationship from further financial/legal problems, and tension with family members who had to rescue him for these things. But lately have backed off a lot because I want him to manage his own affairs. He probably does feel micromanaged, and also feels defensive because he knows that he doesn't think through things well, and that hurts his pride to have it pointed out. But dude it can't be all about him! If he lets me down because of these things, I deserve to be heard. I'm bending over backwards to accommodate his needs or at least understand them, and feel very little reciprocity."
696,"I think one of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard said is ""Every child needs to have their mom/dad in their life."" Your husband would be a horribly toxic influence on your child. Don't feel bad about not being neutral. You shouldn't be. 

Ask yourself: if you heard someone else describe the details of their relationship the way you just did, would you be concerned for the child? For the wife? If the answer is yes, and if you are a reasonable human being it is, then you know you are justified in ending the marriage."
697,Great comment. Great advice!
698,They think that hitting children is OK because it was done to them. It damages them and they continue to normalise that type of behavior throughout adulthood.
699,"Yeah, I guessed. Because anyone hearing this would advise you against marrying such a controlling bastard."
700,"&gt; We'd agree to a solution/compromise to a problem or issue, but after a couple of weeks, he'd stop doing what we agreed on. When asked why, he'd say he didn't like the solution/compromise so he wasn't doing it. Like, motherfucker, why didn't you say that to begin with and we could've figured it out together?

OMG were you dating my ex?  Same thing, except when i would counter ""i didn't like it so i stopped"" with ""but we agreed together this was our compromise"" his reply was, ""You don't always get what you want.""

There is no mature response to that, that i could come up with for about 2 years, until i finally did.  ""I can't have a spouse who compromises, you can't have me.  End of story.""

Yes, i totally left him over his refusal to recycle. Technically."
701,"My brother started getting fewer hours at his current place of employment because, for whatever reason, his manager started hiring a bunch of extra people.  He went straight to her boss (the district manager) and told him he was losing hours he WANTED to work (and was hired under the assumption he'd be working that many hours), and that his direct manager was pushing off all the cleaning/busy work on him despite hiring all these other people.

He now works mostly for their other store in town with the hours he wants.

I realize he didn't have to deal with the personal side of it, but still-go to the highest manager you can, explain that you were hired with the expectation you'd be working X number of hours, and you aren't getting them.  Keep it about that as much as possible, and try not to make it personal about your boss.  "
702,"True. She's probably too nervous to talk to the guy so is trying something. Will probably realise soon enough that the kid won't convey a message like she hopes though haha. Still, no harm in it if she's happy and the kid is getting free toys"
703,"You sound incredibly shallow and immature. If you spend the rest of your life expecting 6packs and basing your relationships off them then good fucking luck. 

This dude deserves way better than you. Be honest and tell him you're only attracted to the abs he used to have so he can find someone who actually likes him for who he is."
704,"I'm gonna advocate for the BF for a second and say that maybe gift giving is his way of expressing affection.

I had a therapist who talked about ways affection is expressed, and touched on a book called ""The Five Love Languages"".

I'm not saying this book is gospel, but anecdotally speaking, I do value acts of service and gift giving/receiving, and my wife values quality time and physical touch.

/u/popsiclecurse should have another talk with her BF and try to really make it sink in that the gift was a good gift and that she appreciates the  gesture. However, it's impractical and she would like the single one. (Maybe even let him get it for her as a gift).

Her BF obviously has an attachment to gift giving, so I don't feel like he's sulking, personally, I'd probably be hurt too if someone gave a gift of mine away or threw it away, but I've also learned to move on. Maybe he just needs help with the moving on part..."
705,"&gt; Both shorter than her so I'm not worried..(not trying to be offensive)

You sound pretty immature, which goes well with being controlling. Maybe take advantage of her requests for space to work on yourself before she runs out of patience."
706,my first instinct was that it could be an expression of control/possessive nature due to insecurity
707,"please beware of taking this load on as well. notice that you're willing to compromise the same boundaries that you were concerned about before, and then some as you listed keeping an eye on her before keeping her company.... i know you love your friend and her son, and i think you're amazing for the support you're giving, but it is beyond your capacity to take her on as a high-maintenance roommate along with her son. let professionals care for her, and support her in getting that kind of help. you have to stay healthy to be there for her after all. "
708,YES I was totally with him up until that point! So cringey.
709,"It sounds like it may be more beneficial for Allie to go stay with her mother. She has no job here to keep her, and a change of scenery and a mini vacation with her son could be just what she needs. Everything in their current home probably reminds her of the partner who abandoned her and of the daughter who died with no warning. Living in that museum of loss wouldn't be good for anyone. :("
710,"I'm surprised you're surprised. Are you sure you're almost 30? You got the internship because you were dating the boss's daughter. Sure, you must have done a reasonably good job to get the actual job offer, but don't fool yourself: You got the offer because you were dating the boss's daughter. 

Then, as you describe it, you showed poor character and judgment in repeatedly refusing to communicate with the daughter, repeatedly breaking up with her then getting back together. That's very disrespectful. If I were her father, I'd wonder if you'd behave the same way on the job -- throwing tantrums, storming off, refusing to communicate.

If you'd handled yourself and the relationship better you might have been able to keep the job. But that's not certain. In any event, you handled yourself poorly.

The problem is that you grew up with a bad model -- ""it didn't really matter how everyone acted"" -- and you expect everyone to accept that. Emotionally healthy people won't. Well, now you know the burden is on you to change, and to behave better. Good luck in the future.

Edit: ""Emotionally healthy"" substituted for ""decent"" last paragraph."
711,"I disagree that he is a necessarily a serial dick pic sender. I've noticed that unless I respond that harshly, some guys don't get the message immediately and will continue harassment. An immediate harsh response can shut down the conversation before it goes any further and leads to more harassment."
712,"Another possibility is that she has another romantic interest. The plan goes like this: she identifies another guy she is interested in, or learns of someone else's interest in her. She doesn't know if she wants to jump ship to this other guy, and also doesn't know if it will work out with him. She now has a problem: if she burns her bridges with her, and it doesn't work out with newguy, then she is single. She would prefer to stay with you if she knows it won't work out with newguy, but if it does work out with him then she is bailing on you for sure. 

Needing space nicely finesses this problem -- she gets to explore the new guy guilt-free, but can unroll the transaction and go back to you, no questions asked if that turns out to be necessary.

I stand by my recommendation to act as if the relationship is over. Hit the gym, talk to pretty baristas, etc etc.

Let's get real here. The reason that you supposedly think he isn't ready and the reason that you like him only having been with his fiancé are one and the same. He's been faithful to this woman for their entire adult lives. If you convince him to have an affair with you, that will in some twisted way make you feel superior. You're trying to get your ego kibbles at this woman's expense. And to add insult to injury you're trying to infantalise her by calling her a girl and insisting that she's ""not ready."""

720,This lady is absolutely right. The problem isn't the book. Give out a read and try to understand her point of view. Counseling and books like this can stir up a lot of shit.

725,"I disagree. Maturity has nothing to do with it. Mature people stumble all the time. Playing with fire always comes with the risk.

I mean, seriously ask yourself what does a ""good friendship"" mean in this context? The ""friendship"" exists possibly *in spite of* the unreciprocated feelings one has towards the other. That's hardly balanced. Let alone whether or not we can know if that imbalance has any impact on the nature of their ""friendship"". It's a facade!

So to say that it ""isn't beneficial to OP or the girl"" is completely missing the point. What about the possible harm? What about all the stories of infidelity we hear that are born in the workplace or at school from a simple ""crush""? What kind of subconscious agenda might emerge from the OP's crush? Can the crush truly just be a friend knowing that her ""best friend"" has a thing for her?

The bottom line is that any ""friendship"" that's subverting deeper feelings has the potential to have detrimental effects through direct or indirect influence. We've all probably experienced it in one way or another, whether directly ourselves or having watched someone go through it.

Fuck that loser. Too bad you can't dump him twice. "
727,"Based on what you describe in your post, it sounds like this whole time you have been operating based on your wife's timeline.  Perhaps, it's time to consider setting your own timeline where you're either actively trying for children or reconsidering your marriage.

Separately, your wife should put together a ""bucket list"" for things she wants to accomplish or do before she has children.  Perhaps you two could take your babymoon (or two) before she's actually pregnant, so that she can go into this process on her terms (at least, to an extent).  If there are other things besides traveling that she wants to do, set aside some time for her to tackle those or for you two to do them together before you begin trying for children in earnest.

You don't want to pressure your wife into having children because that will end badly for you and the children.  But, sometimes people need to be nudged forward and the above two steps would create a framework to this process that doesn't boil it down to an ultimatum.

Lastly, as a father of 2 boys, I can tell you that before I had my children I used to think I would have absolutely no freedom after becoming a father.  It got built up in my mind such that I was wondering when I would ever have a free moment for myself.  While children are a lot of work, especially early on, it was built up 100x worse in my mind than it actually turned out to be.  Perhaps, get your wife to talk about her fears and walk her through things you will do to help her to ease her mind."

You need to figure this out with him because ultimately it affects your relationship.  Does he want you to continue to be so uncomfortable in your living arrangement and at odds with part of his family?  
Something we learned in premarital counseling was that from here on out, we have to protect our new family.  No one should have any influence besides the two of us.  Of course we both want to please our families, but our needs come first.  If you're going to give this a solid go, you have to make a decision together, and stick to it."

741,"This is a weird post, and my comment is kinda bipolar because I am just a little confused. This is mainly to figure out exactly what you are talking about here.

&gt;I'd take a bullet for a husband, but a boyfriend should be able to fight his own battles

So, you would fully support your husband, but your boyfriend is just ""meh""? I don't get that. 

Okay.  What do you think being married changes? You are going to marry the person you are dating and changing how you treat them after that is basically showing that you were either a) putting up a false front or b) didn't care enough to fully commit to them before marriage. Neither of these things are good. You should treat the person you love like they are the person you love- not wait for some certain stage to show it. 

&gt;I do not feel obligated to always tell him everything before I do it

How and why would marriage change this? The only thing marriage should change what you call each other and how you file taxes. Do you just leave and tell him he doesn't get to know where you are going? I'm really confused by this. Giving your SO a heads up on what is going on in your life and what you are up to is so absolutely normal in any relationship.

&gt;I do not feel as though we should have a joint account (he recently suggested we do this, as he has recently disclosed he has insecurities regarding money &amp; women. Previously, when he lived at my apt, there was no discussion of a joint account. We currently live in a rental home in both our names)

This isn't as big of a deal. A lot of people don't join account until after they are married. However, since you are serious and living together, there should be many talks on finances, splits, and other such things.

&gt;I do not feel obligated to confirm my every decision with him

Can I have an example of a decision? Like, do you make big life decisions like quitting your job -which impacts him- or something without talking it out with him? 

&gt;I do not feel obligated to hold to ""for better or for worse"" or to ""love unconditionally""

What do you feel better or worse means? That you would work through issues while married and not when unmarried? 

There is no such thing as unconditional love, but are you like trying to hold back love until someone marries you? I'm still confused.

&gt;Where he feels loved and cared for/secure, but I don't feel as though I'm doing the ""wife work"" without actually being married?

Making someone feel loved and secure isn't ""wife work."" It's the basics of being a decent partner to someone. If you can't support and show love to someone without marrying them, that is a real and sincere problem.

Edit: 

&gt;we were going through a lot of issues, mostly caused by him, in our relationship.

You did get pretty ripped in the original thread. I think everyone was too hard on you. I agree that a heads up text would have been appropriate, but you aren't satan for not sending one. As for your phone, my phone doesn't autolock. I usually manually lock it and keep it in  my pocket when I am out in public with it, but it's conceivable that I might be careless and forget. That's definitely not a sign that anything is fishy bc I'm single.

I just think that everybody, including your husband, was way too hard on you, and I don't think this situation is resolved at home. I would be concerned that my partner would be so quick to believe the worst of me, and I would want that aired out."

It sounds like you and your wife may want to lead different lifestyles. That's generally a dealbreaker. 

Let me just say that most people don't get to take 3 months off out of the year. Have you considered that the constant travel and financial burden you're placing on her when she's making 1/4 of what you make is perhaps a huge contributor to why she's acting the way she's acting? Maybe she's so tired and stressed out from travel that staying in and relaxing is actually quite appealing?

It is absolutely possible for her to find a job with a better salary, but the kind of job with a better salary that *also* allows her to travel the world with you with 12 weeks of vacation time is maybe difficult to find.

763,"Ok, so I'm not monogamous, never have been, never will.  But there's a world of difference between not being monogamous, and not wanting to or not being able to form long-term romantic relationships.  Becoming emotionally and logistically entwined with someone is also a skill, and one that can usually only be learned by doing.  There's a huge difference between being able to chat up a woman enough to get her to go out with you and have sex with you, and being able to grow and maintain an emotional bond that lasts more than a few months.  If ALL you do with your newfound confidence is sleep with women and have casual relationships, you're going to reach your late thirties with absolutely no idea how to be solid, loving PARTNER who can compromise, be supportive, and work through struggles.  In shirt, you won't know how to ""husband"". And so at the point when you WANT to slow down and ""settle down"", you won't be able to find a woman who will do that with you, because you don't have those skills.

You need to think this through, but you need to think it through more efficiently. 

Marriage is a symbolic shorthand way of definitively answering the question ""Are you going to stick around long term?"" It requires effort beyond simply saying that you will, it's something that's too much of a rigmarole to go through unless the couple really means it. It's not foolproof, but the pain in the butt that putting on a wedding is at least proves willingness to do something out of the ordinary when the situation requires it AND that what you're doing for each other isn't something you'd do for just anyone.

I believe you when you say you're not trying to run away.

But the fact is that this is a question that needs an answer.

How much time do you think you'd need to figure out the answer to that question? Do you think you'll be able to come to a conclusion about this while she's still pregnant? If you do decide to get married, I'm guessing at the most you'll be able to push back a wedding to month eight at the latest, as if you back out on wedding plans she'll want to be able to get a plane ticket to get back to family before the baby is born and before week 36/month nine so she doesn't go into labor on the plane.

How reliable is her family? If it's her parents saying to come on home, that they'll help with the baby, (my assumption is that) that's more reliable than a cousin or a sibling offering.

Marriage or not, is your family willing to help with the baby?"
773,"But... why not? Look, you're young. You have your whole life ahead of you. Why this guy, who is halfway around the world and doesn't respect you?  "

Otherwise, you're sending the message it was okay for him to do this. 

Dan: Are you sure he's comfortable with your non-exclusive arrangement? Because it sounds like he was ""okay"" with it so long as you weren't actually seeing other people, then handled it terribly the second you were. You might have started this casually, but I can't imagine that a guy that spends hours on the phone with you &amp; sends you soup when you're sick is truly okay with a casual arrangement where you can go out with other people.

See, my husband would have cut this guy out of his circle immediately.  Not just made comforting noises about vaguely doing something, but stopped all contact with Dave.  I wouldn't have had to actually say anything because my husband is a decent human being *who is repelled by behavior like that--especially towards the people he loves.*

This is no longer about your bf anyway.  This is now about the excuses that you are making to yourself:  **in this respect, your behavior exactly parallels your bf's.**

Do you see that?  Bf has taken no action; *you* have taken no action.  *Both* of you are relying on stasis and inertia to magically resolve the problems.  You won't leave bf because Reasons you keep clinging to even as the situation sours, and your bf won't leave Dave because Reasons that *he* clings to even as the situation sours.

So.  How much longer do you intend to live like this?  Six months?  A year?  Five years?  Because fuck all is going to change in the meantime.

I think you are at ultimatum time:  him or me.  And be prepared for your bf's non-choice.  And be prepared to leave."
793,"100% agreed - sometimes men just need a quick fix, it's nothing personal! The only time I would be a bit concerned about it would be if he wasn't having sex for me for a few months but masturbating instead. But it doesn't sound like this is happening here,  so don't worry about it. "
794,"I myself am really wondering, based on the different details people have gotten me talking about and thinking out."

796,"&gt; In the meantime, try meeting and becoming friends with Asian girls! Or even just friendly acquaintances.

This is the most constructive advice in the thread.

I'm also an Asian-American woman and can confirm that most of us don't like these kinds of guys. It's not fun being fetishized."
797,"In theory a sexual assault charge could be filed against him for his actions since he went beyond what she consented to.  Doesn't mean it will stick but a charge would do a lot of damage.

So she could make the claim that she was sexually assaulted and she defended herself.

Doesn't mean it will hold up in court or during questioning but anything is possible."
798,"He *just* got out of rehab, she probably didn't want to cause a relapse. "
799,"Abortion is still a possibility until 22-24 weeks. Of course, the OP should consider all her options and make her own choices, just wanted to make sure she has as much information as possible."
800,"I had numerous things I dreamt as a kid that I didn't even realise were dreams until I talked about them as an adult. 

One involved a trip to London with my Ma and brother and speaking to the cast of a  cop show around Trafalgar Square  "
801,Dude is a bit of a creep for dating a 16 year old in his 20's. I'd be ashamed of myself in his position.
802,"&gt;I am more conservative and don't believe that people should have friends of the other gender when you are in relationship.

Then you are wrong. 

I don't normally say that about an opinion, but your views do not mesh with the culture of this country, and as an immigrant you're obligated to adapt to some degree. 

&gt; I asked before why they are friends with him if he has a girlfriend 

&gt; I have tried to be nice to his female friends 

Those two statements are incompatible with each other. 

&gt; One of his female friends also made mean comments to me about differing political views, she is Venezuelan, I am from Colombia and she said that I am racist for being conservative, so I made comment about Venezuela collapse and she got mad,

I would bet large amounts of money that she didn't call you racist for being conservative, but rather because you made some racist remark and then tried to hide behind your conservatism. Additionally, it sounds like you're directly antagonizing her about her home country.

You are a toxic person. You need to get over yourself, and quickly. 
"
803,"OP read one of his wife's texts to a friend, you could argue that OP breached his wife's trust by doing that. 

Drawing some conclusions from OPs comments, his wife has to vent at someone from the way his mother treats his wife. Nothing wrong with saying what she said in the confines of a private conversation with a friend. "
804,Sometimes it takes listing out everything to have the 💡 moment. 
805,These are 2 men and a situation you absolutely do not need in your life. 
806,"Wow! Everyone else has already given great advice. I'm glad you are going to buy mix. This was a selfish and unfair thing to ask for. I assume that things have been difficult for them in organising this wedding as so much is left undone, but also they have been taking advantage of people.

It's a shame that your friend is treating you like this. 

Good luck and let us know how it goes!"
807,"I used to think long term affairs could be forgiven until I discovered r/adultery and a couple of other subs where cheating is pretty much encouraged. Do you know what I noticed? Not a single post I read included the words ""I feel bad""  or ""I regret this"" infact it was the contrary they bragged about it and are proud it. Betraying their partner is an achievement to them. 

Please note that I'm not saying all cheaters are like that but enough of them are.

OP were there any word in the text that you read that implied reluctance from wife? If the answer is no, then that's all the evidence you need to know this isn't the first time, your wife is probably a pro by now.

Do you know why she doesn't want to perform those sex acts with you? She doesn't find you attractive, ask anyone that's has settled or has been  settled for. If your partner loves doing blowjobs but she doesn't want to do them to you, the blowjobs aren't the problem, it's you. In your wife's mind you're unworthy of those sex acts.

OP let's say 5 years from now you're dying, it doesn't matter how, are you going to spend the last years of your life trying to fix a relationship with someone that has proved to you that she doesn't care about you? Life is short, don't waste it  on someone that has been shitty to you."
808,"This comment should be higher!! From what I've read, your mother is unreasonable, and the only way to reason with unreasonable people is to talk with people they trust. Get your stepdad on the same page as you and she will probably be on board.

If she really truly doesn't stop, just tell your stepdad that he will always be invited no matter what your mom decides to do. He is not causing undue stress, she is. Make him see this."
809,"So I don't know if this is you projecting these feelings onto your boyfriend, or if he actually feels this way but ""porn has a high importance to him"" is...pretty bizarre and unhealthy imo. I think it's dead normal and fine to watch porn, but hearing someone say it's extremely important to them is weird. 

I don't know, I just think someone that states porn has a high importance in their life has some issues. "
810,"&gt; they're my friends

Are they, though?  They don't have to like your girlfriend, but they need to be polite - and by your own admission, they haven't been doing that for a long time prior to this blowup.  Not to mention the disrespect they're showing *you* and your choices by holding stuff against her that appears to be your decision, like the dishes.  I understand confrontation is scary, but as you're now seeing, avoiding it doesn't make the problems go away; if anything, they tend to get worse."
811,It makes me feel gross and awkward. I get nothing from watching strangers engage in sexual acts. 
812,"I don't think we have enough information to know this is true. For all we know, the OPs are making their friend uncomfortable by constantly going on and on about his abs, touching him, or bringing up how hot he is all the time, and his other friends are trying to tell them to stop.  "
813,"I'll try and stay out of the conversation as much as possible - I very much believe this is their decision and no one should be influencing them. I'm concerned that BIL will drag me into it though.

I don't think they'd go for equity release as wouldn't the lender then have a charge on the house? Could they force the sale once the parents pass away?"
814,"No offense to you, OP, as I don't have the slightest idea what you look like, but it's not because you're a hottie. It's because you are her one way ticket to a comfortable life in the UK.

Because I'm pretty sure Courtney will no longer speak with you if you get with Justin..."

818,"he needs to call them out, and not blame you.

 he needs to put his marriage above their drama. you need to talk to him and ask that he make boundaries with his family.

 if you don't make boundaries as a team, their drama will be toxic forever."
819,"You have, it was from the fiance's perspective and the guy in the post was clearly in an incestuous relationship with his sister(he wanted to bring her on their honeymoon). There's about a .1% chance this post is real."
820,100% agree with this response as well
821,"But I also think it's telling her primary partner, assuming they weren't real triad, continued to bring his girlfriend around despite their breakup. I would be very careful and prepare yourself for bad news bears when you tell him you'd like to renegotiate and talk about boundaries and new rules. Cause what he did is pretty disrespectful and telling."
822,"You need a lawyer. 

When my husband's ex found out he was in a new relationship, she got angry and went after him for child support. Kid was 4 and they had broken up when he was 1. She lied and said he never gave her any money for support, and my husband never saved any proof. His oldest son was also 4 at the time and he instantly owed so much back support that they garnished his check and kept his tax returns for years. 

You have nowhere to hide. Tell her, make alternative living arrangements, and get a lawyer. And then figure out how to make amends to ALL of your children because that is going to take you the rest of your life. "
823,"Actually, none of that is true. Fathers that fight for custody win MORE often, no matter what their background. "
824,"&gt; She wanted money above her discretionary amount, 

No she did **not**.

Selling her property is not going above the discretionary amount. It's finding another perfectly legitimate way to get the money without going above the agreed limit. These are **her things** and she should be able to liquidate them if she feels like it. Her husband should not get to veto that decision. "
825,I think that you're finding out why his relationships tend to last around five or six months
826,"Not that it matters too much, but at no point does the OP say the outburst was in front of the grandson."
827,"I was gonna say. 

OP please explain the Chipotle diet to us. Fame and glory await you."

829,"And if she does, you explain to them why. You explain to them that you are a person with happiness to seek, and that you still love them. Let them see with time that you are doing what is best for you, and in the long run, for them. "
830,Relationships aren't about forcing people to change for you. 
831,"Also, though, even if it takes him a million years to ""phase out"" the personal phone, that doesn't explain why he won't give her the number for the personal phone. If it's going to be ""phased out"" anyway, why not just let her know the number in the interim? "
832,"This this this. She accepted this was how he was--but apparently that is how he was with a 20 lb heavier gf. Being a little more effusive/sexually charged is one thing (it's kind of like getting to date a new girl without giving up the old girl!), but to not be invited to work functions or lunch is really offensive. As if being seen with a ""chubby chick"" would affect his status. I'd feel (and have felt) like OP."
833,"are you joking. she cheated on him, he can react however he needs to at this point. not only did she cheat on him, but lied to him about it for months. i'm not saying he should absolutely leave her or anything but you're out of your damn mind if you think he's overreacting by being distressed about this"
834,Actually I honestly think she doesnt have deal breakers other than like cheating or something like that
835,"Ask him if the real reason he keeps Frosty separate is because he doesn't like you.  

A bit backwards, but you may get more answers out of it."
836,"Augh, no.  **Never set a trap like that in a mature relationship.**   When (not if) it get discovered it will poison trust.  If you don't trust your partner to be truthful and open, then **that is the core problem** not whatever sleuthing you're trying to do.

OP, just talk to him and figure out what the deal is, with all the detail you know.  Be open about your own behavior too, and tell him how you found that and that you saw the facebook query history.  If this is a purely professional relationship, he'll have nothing to hide and you have nothing to worry about."
837,"Seriously - there's always people around (the bridal party, parents, the officiant, or worst case, there's THE PHOTOGRAPHER) while taking photos. Someone else can hang on to the water and no one would have any idea he drank some between pictures. Hell, I think my photographer even had a bottle of water in his equipment bag! 

As for the ceremony, I'd say that depends on how long it is. My non-religious ceremony was like 15 min tops. Some services can last a hour or more. But I find that the longer ones tend to have moments where the couple is sitting down, so it would be completely discreet to have a bottle of water stashed under OP's chair. His fiancé can even gift him a fancy engraved steel bottle to use. "
838,"OP, you don't need an excuse, just say you are not physically able to help, any time and every time your husband and his family brings up the subject with you. You should not let your husband or his family bully you into doing something you can't and won't do. Don't even try to defend your decision beyond stating your position as many times as necessary. If they still try to challenge your decision, walk away from them."
839,"I suspect your mom has some anxiety and panic about the idea of the guy and just doesn't want to run the chance of even seeing him. And that's perfectly understandable. She went through some trauma when she was young and probably didn't really deal with it. I know you want to go, but think about how your mom will feel if she sees a man who abused her friends. Imagine what you would feel. I wouldn't want to come face to face with someone I knew was a child abuser, and I didn't have it in my childhood. Yes the risk of anything is minute, but anxiety isn't rational and it makes you feel appalling inside.

You could try to ask her if you can go with just your dad, and that you'll stick close to him all the time. You'll avoid the leather work stall. Let her know that you understand that she must be feeling horribly anxious about seeing the man again and you don't want to make her go through seeing him.

She could also tell the police if it's a different jurisdiction from the one where he abused the kid in he past. They may want to put extra patrols on the fair or go and have a chat with him."
840,"Have an honest heart to heart with your boyfriend. You have gained 38% body weight since you started dating. That is not an insignificant number. If you like being this way, and he does not, don't keep dragging it out with future (implicit) promises of change."
841,"so her sister in dying and she's supposed to go out of her way for her husband to make HIM feel better?????? that is completely ass backwards. he should be doing little things for HER, and thanking his lucky stars that it's not his sibling in there dying."
842,"I think he really likes the ""party"" atmosphere of it. People sing, play guitars, play video games, darts, etc... We have talked about this and one of the things he loves is the ""authenticity"" of it. I get all of this. We both came from shit poor and abusive families and I think both of us think at heart we don't belong in a gated community with a pool. So I'm not sure if a soup kitchen would have have the same effect for him...for me it would be great. Sorry for rambling, I'm exhausted."
843,[deleted]
844,Zack why are you ruining OP's special day when he sees you own things all the time
845,"I kinda got this impression too when he went out of his way to say

&gt; Knowing that this process would take at least 30 minutes if we were lucky

that's kinda a low blow in this situation and fairly snarky considering the initial shock of it all is over.

It sounds like she wants to help and be supportive - and he's not only shutting her down, but judging her as selfish and not really giving her a chance to prove him otherwise.
My guess is this is why she's hurt.  
"
846,"&gt; We have major communication issues. I try to start off calm and bring an issue up and try to work through it but the second I say anything not-happy, he instantly shuts me out and stone walls me. 

You should not be considering marriage until you figure out how to communicate healthily. Without intervention, it will likely get worse. It's not just you that needs to see a therapist about it. If he's stonewalling and gaslighting, he needs an individual therapist, and it'd be helpful to have a couples therapist too.

&gt;  But I know it's not my place to tell him to stop, most people watch it.

Not necessarily true. Porn is this weird thing that the internet insists 100% of men do it and any of them who say they don't is lying - but that is simply not true. Lots of people feed into this stereotype though. I think if something bothers you in your relationship, you should be able to talk to your partner about it. They might have a different point of view, they might not see it as a big deal at all, but they should at least be able to understand that it's an important issue for you and try to compromise or come to a solution to help you feel better. For example, I brought this up early in my relationship and how much it bothers me, and my boyfriend said he'd stop watching it and be honest with me if he ever gets the urge to watch it again. Lies like that are a huge betrayal to me. I always appreciate how open and honest our relationship is in many regards, especially this one. We both talk openly about sex and ensuring our sex life is good for both of us. 

&gt; he does it near daily and 100% neglected me in bed

Yeah, this is definitely an issue, a big issue. Sex is really important in relationships, and sexual compatibility. If you guys can't talk about this or work towards a solution, you're headed towards a dead bedroom. Those are no joke, and without serious intervention they rarely get better.

&gt;  I know I'll probably be the bad guy but I don't know.

&gt; He always picks porn over me.

You're really not, stop being so hard on yourself. Have you talked about your low self esteem in therapy? You're worth more than being second place to porn and lying.

You have a selfish partner. He lies to you frequently - I doubt you trust him anymore and he's doing nothing to try and earn your trust back. He refuses to communicate with you. He gaslights you which is **emotional abuse** and you start to question if your version of reality is correct. You start to feel crazy. My mom gaslighted me a lot during my childhood and I only really understood why I felt like I was the one with the problems when I started going to therapy to unpack all of the emotional abuse that happened when I was little. He doesn't care about your happiness sexually (and I'm guessing in other aspects of your relationship as well). Do you really want a future of this? Either both of you get serious help for your issues, or you should get out. The relationship will likely become abusive in other ways, and you'll waste years of your life with this selfish man."
847,"This is simply not true.


Parents are required by law to make sure their kids are not in harm mentally or physically. You can't treat a kid however you want and just say ""it's your choice"". 


If anyone told CPS your underage kid stays at home and watches their underage sibling whenever they get sick and that your kid is not allowed to socialize on a normal day because it has to babysit, you would get in serious trouble. Not only is ""babysitting"" not a legal reason to keep your kid from attending school, it is entirely illegal to let a kid work more than four hours on a school day (in most states at least, even in those where there are no laws about this, 4-5 hours is still the rule of thumb). 


Even if OPs parents ""work their ass off"", it was their choice to have kids and they should suffer the consequences, not OP. There's no way to justify parents working their kid to the bone as a babysitter while spending a huge amount of money on themselves. I say this as a mother of 6. If the parents want to get time off, they could have gone somewhere cheaper and then have spend some money on their kids well being."
848,Uh. No. Do not do this there are weight classes for a reason in fights. He will seriously hurt you. 
849,"Can't say I agree - he knows the cost of going to Hawaii! If you were claiming a lack of time then it would look bad, but this is finances, pure and simple. If you can't afford it, you can't afford it. The fact that you can afford something cheaper doesn't change anything! "
850,"This may get down voted all to hell, but whatever. I would absolutely *not* go away for the weekend to see your friends. That allows him to have a guilt free weekend, at your home, at your expense. Fuck that noise. I would contact each one of the people he invited, explain that there was a mix up in dates, that your house isn't available for lodging that weekend but that you'll be happy to host them another time. They can change the dates of their travel tickets, and if there's a fine or a fee, honestly your boyfriend should pay for it. Then invite up YOUR friends, do activities that YOU want to do, and enjoy YOUR birthday. "
851,"If she wanted to be friends with you, she would be friends with you. You can't send her a letter asking for change while saying ""I dont expect anything for you from reading this"" while clearly telling her that things need to happen. That's just a really manipulative way to write. "

853,"Thank you so much, what makes it even harder was that it was her father (my sister's ex-husband) that did it. He survived of course and we're left with a giant hole in our hearts where she should be. "
854,"You should copy and paste exactly what you wrote in those 5 text messages when you kept accusing her before she got back to you. Depending on how bad it is what you wrote, that could affect what people advise. "
855,"Relationship is not the court, where you have to get solid evidence to warrant some action. If you feel uncomfortable, get out. You are allowed to break up even if you don't like the color of her shirt, she might complain to her friends that you're a jerk because of that, but so what."
856,"I really don't see the point in ""demanding"" an apology. To me, an apology is worthless if you have to demand it and questionable if you even have to ask for it. "
857,"This, so much. I only knew about the placebos because I heard it mentioned on reddit a few times. I wouldn't even necessarily blame OP for not knowing. In a lot of places they don't teach this stuff, and it's not so unforgivable that it didn't occur to him to Google it.

But the fact that he jumped to accusations and the worst case scenario, letting his friend poison his thoughts instead of having a reasonable conversation? That is a major fuck up."
858,"Same, my mom waited until I was already in a relationship at 17. ""Now that you're in a relationship maybe we should have the sex talk."" ""I'm good."" End of story."

861,I keep trying to remind myself of that fact. He knew this would end us and he's completely okay with that. Why does he get to soothe his feelings with having me still be there to talk to him? I miss him every minute but I'm trying to keep strong in the severing. 
862,Terse and perfect. 
863,"That seems like a huge red flag to me. You know, on top of ALL THE OTHER CREEPY RED FLAGS. "
864,"I'm not sure what you've done to earn any trust back, other than being honest (which is good).  You make it sound like you had a million chances to stop yourself from doing what you did, but did it anyways.  To me this suggests that you have poor boundaries and self esteem to begin with.  Honestly you need to do a lot of work on yourself and be patient."
865,"It's over and it sucks that it ended that way. He's not worth any more of your time. End it, cut contact, block him. Fuck that guy (but don't fuck that guy - ever again). 

Given that you were planning on moving elsewhere at the end of the month, it seems like a good time for a fresh start for you. Find somewhere else to live and forget about being ""perfect for him"" - work on being perfect for you. Find a hobby, spend time with friends and family, and move on in the best possible way - for you. 

Good luck! "
866,"Lmao wtf? She is making porn, and she wasn't okay with you just watching it?"
867,"Not even the benefit of the doubt, if there is doubt and you know nothing about how birth controls work at least take the time to Google it before trusting the sexist friend.

Trust but verify. Not kinda verify and then distrust"
868,"She should've broken up with you. You showed how ignorant, rash, and prone to stereotyping you are in one fell swoop."
869,"&gt;If you're initiating all the time, however, that may be an issue.

Not really. Not necessarily. A lot of relationships, guys are expected to do all or almost all the initiating. The fights, and the pushiness, are what aren't okay."

871,"You're allowed to break up for any reason or no reason at all. This whole relationship is cringeworthy starting with you apologizing for his abuse. You two don't seem to be suited to each other. When you have a gut instinct that something isn't right, it's a good idea to follow it. It's also pretty sad that he felt the need to get his mommy involved. Block her and him and move on with your life. "
872,"In an abusive situation, the victim is often the stressed one and the abuser isn't. The abuser has created a dysfunctional situation *because they're comfortable with dysfunction,* while the victim is stressed by it."
873,"If he's honest about the weight thing, he will find someone who either likes it or doesn't care. I like a nice gut on a dude.

He needs to brush his teeth and clean his house yesterday, though. Is he depressed? If he is and he fixes that, the cleanliness issues will fix themselves &amp; if he does want to lose weight that will come easier."
874,I 100% agree. I'm going to edit my words to reflect that.
875,Yeah I have no idea where in the US that could be. Like...Somewhere stuck in the Forties???
876,"you were broken up. that means you were allowed to sleep with whoever you want.  the fact that he's holding it over your head is unacceptable.

if he would either do it behind your back or break up with it because you're not willing to submit to his sexual demands, good riddance.

you need to tell him, bluntly: ""I am never going to want to have a threesome. You need to stop mentioning it because it is never going to happen.  You need to decide which is more important to you, me or the threesome because you can't have both.""

if he doesn't stop this, it shows that he doesn't respect your limits and that's not something you want in a partner.  You also don't want a partner who emotionally blackmails you and holds your past over your head.  you deserve better."
877,"I think you're overestimating the biological risks of having children in the *early* thirties. This happens a lot on reddit. The risks of pregnancy/childbirth don't really notably become of concern to health care professionals until the mother is over 35. Even then, it's still not *that* bad. Health care professionals don't really start to worry until the mother is over 40. 

Women feel enough pressure to have kids young due to the over-simplification of the ""biological clock"" thing. You're kind of making it worse. If you stay physically fit, the transition to having children will not be that bad if you're in your thirties. "
878,"&gt; My therapist gave me the idea of thinking of my recurrent thoughts about my bad breakup as if it was an annoying person who sometimes turns up to talk to me.  

This is a great technique, and really helpful. Thank you.

"
879,"NO OP. Stop making excuses for him. The fact that he has SECRETLY recorded you masturbating without your consent is VERY unethical not to mention highly probable that it is illegal. You need to find and or demand all footage be wiped clean. Don't let this go just because you think he will not distribute it. 
I would highly suggest to break up with him because you should not put up with this disgusting, not to mention very intrusive and scary behaviour.
I'd also suggest talking to an office or consult a lawyer/ r/legaladvice"
880,"Since you'll be gone in a few months, you shouldn't care much about what your current colleagues think. here's the thing: you'll likely never encounter them again. So, stop caring about saving face. Your problem is with Carol, not with your colleagues. They are inconsequential. 

Actually, I'd go even one step further, and say that your problem isn't with Carol, but with yourself. Reading your comments on this thread it feels to me like you are a person who likes to make everybody happy and that you can't stand confrontation.  You think that saying 'no' makes you mean, when really, it just means that you are not a meek pushover who people can abuse.

The fact of the matter is that a lot of people won't like you. The fact of the matter is that confrontation will happen in your life, no matter how nice you try to be. You need to accept this and learn to deal with it. You have to learn to be assertive, even if this means that at times it makes you disagreeable. This won't turn you into a bitch, just into a grown up mature woman who can handle herself. If you don't, be prepared to keep on encountering Carols time and time again, and you'll be as defenseless then as you are now. "
881,"I know right. People keep going on about ghosts when the actual situation is these people could be being poisoned. And if it's not carbon monoxide, OP's girlfriend should still see a doctor to talk about possible neurological or psychological problems. "
882,"People close to you can often see you more clearly than you can yourself, because they're actually looking at you. Holding people st arms length, that's a pretty objective observation, especially if she's including herself in this. I wouldn't trust her opinion on your possible depression, but the affection thing bothers her because it's directly related to your relationship and she's missing that physical connection. "
883,"your dad kind  of brought this on when he repeatedly exposed his children to this nonsense. let him be upset, he has his family AND himself to blame"
884,"""Allergic rhinitis"" is another word for ""hay fever,"" or ""seasonal allergies.""

Are you in the Northern hemisphere? If so, it's winter and unlikely that they'd play a significant issue--if she's showing symptoms, it's probably just a cold. 

Regardless, allergies are not contagious. Additionally, you very rarely go from non-infected to sick overnight; you were probably infected with a cold or sore throat causing bacteria or virus a few days ago, and your body is just now reacting to it. 

Don't worry about it. Kissing doesn't cause sickness; kissing while sick might spread it, though."
885,"I'm not married. But no men never have to ""choose"" whether or not to give up the name, it's assumed their name will be passed on. Only women do. It is a sexist practice. "
886,It's also creepy that thirty something year old was chasing after women a decade younger. OP dodged a bullet but a little too late.
887,"Ah I'm in LA and the same age as you. Had this exact problem until I buckled down and refined my Dating in LA™ checklist. First thing was remove alcohol from the equation. I stopped drinking anyway so this was a good way for me to get creative when meeting guys. It also helped in staying alert for potential red flags early on that get overlooked when you do drinks or other outings that involved alcohol. 

Second was removing intimacy beyond heavy petting until exclusivity. This was more for me and not an antiquated make him earn it bs but because I felt it important to really ensure the person was someone I wanted to share intimacy with. 

Third was review correspondence with a fine tooth comb. 
Were there offhand remarks that he threw out that rubbed me the wrong way but I ignored? Did he ask me something overly sexual? Were my intimacy boundaries being crossed or pushed? Did interests seem either superficial or just totally not aligned with mine? Did he not respond to message? Did his actions differ from what he said? If I answered yes to any of those it was a no and I moved on. This method helped me tremendously and I feel like the 2-3 guys I met before my boyfriend (met on OKCupid in January 2016) were also really good people just not for me.

Fourth was less important because I quit using Tinder altogether but the feature that shows you how you are connected to a match did wonders.

Edit: also forgot to add if you're very good looking and/or a minority I've found dudes are so entranced by your appearance and who they think you are (so many stereotypes) they might have you f'd up for the type who is interested in non serious relationships. Can't tell you the number of times I encountered this phenomenon as a very weird but also attractive person in this city 🤦🏿‍♀️"
888,"I wonder what the safe serv standards on such attire is. It just sounds unsanitary. 

If this is a boundary, i hope he respects it. If this is so important to him that he's willing to give up the relationship, then that's his problem"
889,"&gt; I want to hurt him bad without getting any consequences.

You've admitted wanting to commit violence yourself. This is not an impulse you want to be in the habit of indulging. Also, you've been subjected to violence over trivial things. It's traumatic. Trauma can cause problems."
890,"For towels you can sew a thread-dot in one of the corners. Goes for clothes too, if you don't remove the label, or putting it on a seam."
891,"&gt;I look nothing like the pornstars

*Nobody* looks like the pornstars. 

The *pornstars* look nothing like the pornstars - it's largely Photoshop.

 fantasy ≠ reality. 

Plus, it seems to be working for you, indirectly - the threesome for example.

No need to be insecure."
892,"If it was an isolated incident I could understand watching a playoff game with his Dad. Sometimes this is how dads and sons connect and bond. It might seem weird but it can really be important.

On the whole though, he is showing you through his actions that you are not all that important to him. "
893,"If you assume that he has a veto but she doesn't then, yeah, it would be unfair. Based on the post there's no reason to assume that, though."
894,"yeah, r/childfree is a bit variable, and a lot of crap, but they are also very good with concrete questions like yours when and if they are asked: I suggest asking a version there"
895,"Thanks, I'll try wording it that way."
896,"basically he thought he would ask some of his friends first and then fill the remaining space with my friends so we could have both of our friends up but then it turned out that everyone of his friends could make it so there wasnt any room for my friends so he didnt bother to contact them.

i like the skype idea as we skype quite a lot anyways "
897,"Block him and move on with your life.  Sounds like onset of schizophrenia to me, but whatever.  You don't need him in your life."
898,"I'm going to put another possibility out there. You say that your boss' bf is doing this in front of her and she's not reacting. Also, she doesn't mention any problems of cheating or anything. 

Is it possible that he's just trying to be friendly? The reason your boss doesn't say anything is because she knows it's just friendly? And not even just friendly but if you're this woman's mentee, maybe she talks about you a lot to her bf. Mention she's talked about you so much and sees you almost like a daughter that he feels like he knows you? And maybe she's asked him to be nice to you and make you feel included?

I talk to my partner about my mentees all the time, because I really care about them and I'm invested in them, so he'd probably know more about them than if they were just another employee. 

And maybe he's an awkward dude. He might be trying too hard and not realise how weird he seems.

Or he could be hitting on you in front of his gf who doesn't seem to care and who trusts you enough to tell you that they're having problems with his mom but hasn't said anything about him cheating. 

Either one."
899,Hard pass.  There are just so....so many ways for this to ruin everybody's lives.  
900,"&gt; there may not be much she can realistically do about this weight gain.

This is literally NEVER true unless she is bedbound and being fed through a tube.

Certain meds increase appetite or lethargy.  This makes it require more willpower and/or discipline to lose weight but it is never impossible.  And even if it is too hard for OP's wife to lose weight using all reasonable efforts, those efforts would at least reduce the amount of weight gain....and she isnt making them!

It's never ""not worth"" exercising or trying to watch what you eat.  It's never futile.

This pervasive myth is just a rationalization of bad choices.  ""Yeah I never exercise and eat loads of junk, but my medication makes weight loss impossible so what's the point"".... 


"
901,"Also, who is in the habit of leaving their phone lying around in public and doesn't have a passcode on it?!?!? AND it's a 4s to boot, so she's managed to hang onto it for what? 6 years? That doesn't make sense, she would have lost/destroyed it by now if she's that careless. I have a 4s and the only reason that thing is still alive and well is because I have taken great care of it and keep it securely in my possession (the three otterboxes I have destroyed have helped too). 

I call bullshit."
902,"He *threw* his daughter's toys AT HER, A TEN MONTH OLD BEING HELD BY HER MOTHER.

You look at abusive situations where the abuser ""lost their temper"", they *aim* it at their victims and anything/one they love. When they break stuff ""in a fit of rage"", most of the time it's their victims stuff that's broken. Abusers rarely differ in their techniques."
903,"Sometimes protection is another form of control. You seem to have a pretty good grip on the situation, but remember this if you ever start to feel guilty about turning your back on family: just because he thinks he's ""protecting"" you, doesn't mean he respects you or cares about what's best for you. He's acting out of his own interest 100% in this situation. "
904,"Yeah, maybe as a last resort... I bet it'd feel like a real gut punch. :/ Thanks for the suggestion."
905,"From the perspective of someone still at uni around your sons age: a lot of my friends have tried cocaine and I would certainly say that it's something people try. It doesn't necessarily mean he's an addict though just because you saw him doing a line, he might be doing it recreationally. That being said you're entitled to react to drugs and them being used in your home however you would like. I'm not sure you can convince your husband as drug taking is just one of the things that people take different sides on. I think you can have a compromise by putting your foot down and saying drug taking is absolutely not allowed in your house or in your presence, get the dad to talk to your son about responsible drug taking  and giving your son the bare minimum financially so for his food, education and accommodation to insure you're not paying for his habit. "
906,"Your ex cheated on you because he's an asshole, so let's get that out of the way. He is a big, disgusting, gaping asshole shitting all over everything and everyone in his presence. That said, I don't believe in ""bad in bed"" as a concept anyway. You can be selfish in bed, but there's no such thing as objectively *bad*. He said it because he's a huge, gaping asshole who wanted you to feel bad about yourself. If you're doing anything besides laying there and letting him do all the work, you're not bad in bed.

Block him, delete his number, and count your blessings that he's gone."
907,"She totally ate your food and is lying about throwing it out, but confronting her on it probably won't do anything. Is there an RA you can talk to? 

Either that, or time to start taking pictures. ""Oh you say we left it a mess?? Well this time stamped picture shows otherwise"" "
908,There's a reason people say actions speak louder than words. It doesn't matter how many times he agrees with you or promises to do better if nothing ever changes.
909,"Couldn't you say a similar thing the other way around though? Like, why ruin a good relationship just so you don't have to give a ring, have a ceremony and a certificate? 

At most you could probably say divorce would make things messy which wouldn't be an issue without marriage, but there are ways to settle divorce civilly and you can even prepare for it post marriage. 

Overall the ""what's the big deal"" can go both ways. "
910,"Not sure I understand here. Why would anyone be resentful of someone else sitting them down and having a serious conversation about marriage? I would think that that is part of moving forward, isn't it?"
911,"&gt; His ""passion project"" needs to stop, or at least be moved to 2nd place behind updating his resume and getting a job. Don't excuse his lack of work with this 0-income side project.
&gt; 

Send him some Gary Vaynerchuk videos where he talks about how many passionate creative people are forced to--and thrive--working on their passion projects between 8pm-1am six nights a week when working, getting to the gym, maintaining a real life. 

People waste so much time doing nothing while bitching about how little time they have. "
