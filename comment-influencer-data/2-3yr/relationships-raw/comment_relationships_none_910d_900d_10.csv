1,"Whatever you took out made your post impossible to understand.  She might be a liar, you might be overly sensitive, you both might be sentient mushrooms with the ability to type.  Need more detail to make any judgement at all...

2,God that would be exhausting.  I would've gone to HR a long time ago.

It's hard because we all have the same group of friends. So I'm not gonna not hang out with our otherwise cool group just because he's there. But yeah, when she invites me out to dinner so she's not waiting for him alone in a restaurant I'm gonna start to take a pass. 

His line is ""EVERYONE HATES ME AND IS TALKING ABOUT ME!!!11"" He's not wrong, but he takes it out on Emily big time. So we all have to tip toe around it. It suuuucks."
4,"I read somewhere on this sub recently that ""when people show you their true colors, believe them the first time"".

I can understand why ""requests"" and ""ultimatums"" are a thing in other people's relationships, but they just never really work for me personally when it comes to breaking certain boundaries. I would rather just get rid of someone than try to dictate their behavior.

Your bf thinks it is okay to add attractive women so he can oogle them, and that would make me super uncomfortable. Instead of asking him to stop, I think you should take a step back objectively so you can view his behavior. He thinks it is okay to act this way in a relationship, and you don't. Trying to police activity will create this odd dynamic in which you will feel a tad bit guilty and he will feel a tad bit nagged. Not really cool in my honest opinion.

Your boundaries do not have to be right or wrong; only you can determine what you are comfortable with. I, personally, have no interest dating a man who adds random people for the sake of looking at them on facebook. It's creepy to me.

I don't think you are in the wrong at all, I just don't think this guy is worth your time. "
5,"Did that boss enforce that rule, and how? Demand to see text message proof or something?"
6,"Big, or old. I had an ex who was obsessed with, like, rare old Lego from eBay. "
7,She doesn't sound like she wants to change. I feel like she'll just keep giving you the excuse that this guy is a friend. I personally would not be comfortable with this situation. 
8,"I totally agree! Plus sometimes you get a wider array of experiences online, and there could be more potential to identify with someone."
9,The major roadblock is I haven't been able to find a therapist who will see me on a monthly basis versus a weekly session. Once or even twice a month I could swing it but I just can't pay $100 a week for months.

11,"&gt;She seems to think I need to discuss every purchase with her

So it's pretty clear you wrote this out just to vent and hear people tell you what a controlling buzzkill your lame-o girlfriend is for trying to tell a grown man how to spend his own money. Sorry bro but your GF is being totally reasonable here. Discussing a $3,000 toy purchase with your live-in SO of 4 years is not at all the same thing as ""discussing every purchase with her"". "
12,"Private citizens don't ""press charges"", the district attorney decides whether or not to do that. And since the police didn't see anything worth arresting SIL over it seems unlikely that the local DA will pick this up and spend the time and money pursuing it. OP can sue civilly for any related medical costs, but those would be the only real damages that would be considered in civil court."
13,"Ditto on this, OP.

TAs aren't necessarily as well versed with these types of things and they hear complaints about group work ALL THE TIME.  It sounds like the TA is assuming this is a communication and interpersonal issue rather than an ethical one.

Also would suggest you get it on file (as in email, officially) with your course coordinator that you suspect your partner is a plagiarist so that if you do miss something and your paper is called up for plagiarism, there'll be a record that you tried to do something about the issue before hand."
14,I nearly vomited at the thought of wearing socks that used to have cum in it. Make sure to smear his socks in your period blood and just innocently giggle
15,"Yeah, its his age.

Give it a few years."
16,"I don't get why the locks are an issue for him, if anything he should *want* the locks to be different for security so that if they lose one key, they don't have to get every single lock on their house replaced. "
17,"Wh...why does he have so many clothes? Does he never do laundry or something? I have a shopping problem and I don't have 2 dressers + a whole closet's worth of clothes...he seems to have almost a hoarding problem if he has so much stuff that he apparently can't be parted from. Making you walk all the way to the other room to get your own clothes...wow.

Give him one last chance. Tell him that you need to be able to keep clothes and jewelry in the bedroom so you can get dressed, he needs to de-clutter his own stuff that's spread across everywhere, and there's no excuse for him to use the rent thing because he knew exactly how much you could pay from the very beginning. *He* was the one who chose to live in a place that was more than you two could split equally. If he refuses, proceed to exit strategy.

Are you on the lease together? If so, find out how you can get off of the lease ASAP. Find yourself a nice $400 basement apartment. "
18,"OBGYN nurse here. Those bumps could be a lit of tjings that are totally normal, such as :fordyce spots, angiokeratomas, or vestibular papilloma which is why all your tests come up with a whole lot of nothing. It's because there's nothing wrong with you. I bet if those spots weren't there you wouldn't feel anything, but you've got yourself all worked up so OF COURSE YOU DO. 

Yes, you should get your Pap at 21. You should do that anyway, all women should. If what you've written is true, you can't possibly have come into contact with any strain of HPV.  Therefore, you can't have HPV.

19,"""Ex's parents, I appreciate that you mean well, but I need you to respect my request for space right now.  When I am ready to get together, I will reach out and let you know.  Until then, please don't expect any more responses from me.""

If that doesn't get the message across, then unfortunately, ghosting may be your only option.  If they're trying to keep a foothold in your life so they can force you and Ex back together regardless of what's best for you, then their intentions aren't really as good as they might seem."
20,"&gt;I do like her but she does not feel the same way, **I respect that.**

Do you respect it? Because it sounds like she's keeping you at arms length for a reason, and people rarely do that without reason. My first guess would be that your advances/behavior/tone/interactions reek of trying to ""get with"" her or get on her good side....

Assuming you're being honest about your behavior towards her, it sounds like she just might not be able to handle being friends with a man who has an interest in her that she doesn't reciprocate.

Give her time and space, but be prepared to accept that she does not want to continue being your friend."
21,"I'm a advocate, but this isn't the place dude."
22,"This is what happens to child abusers. This is sexual abuse. You were molested. If you tell your parents now, there's a chance they can get her help. If she does it to someone else later in life, then she's going to prison, and then her life really will be ruined. "
23,"I think i'm mainly torn because prior he was the most genuine, loving person. So, this is all a shock to me. Otherwise it would be an easy decision. He says he knows he messed up and he is sorry. The hardest thing i'm having trouble getting over is the fact that he knew their relationship made me uncomfortable after finding the first texts and he didn't stop right then and there. He says he was more annoyed at the whole situation then (that I went through his phone and his parents got involved), so he didn't really soak it in.

26,"I hate to be blunt in what can only be an emotionally traumatic event, and obviously, this may not be her intent at all. 

But in my experience this far in life, this has usually turned out to be the case. I'm sorry if it hurts to hear. "
27,"&gt; I think he still owes you rent for the rest of the lease. You are already being generous by letting him skip out on the rest of the rent and leave the lease. 

Yep.  How much is rent, has he moved out?  Deduct rent from security deposit  

Wonder if 3rd roomie paid 2nd roomie rent and he pocketed it.  Contact his friend OP."
28,"You could try taking pictures of his mistakes and then emailing him.   If he can't be talked into being empathetic, force him by making him feel the feelings you are doing.  The bitchy part of me would want to say something like this after sex.  ""Well, that was completely unacceptable.  Three minutes of foreplay, and no orgasm.  I really don't like the direction this is headed.""  "
29,"&gt; Should I just go anyway despite his protests?

Not if you want to still be married to him when you get back. What a bizarre question. 

I think you're approaching this problem the wrong way, you are married. You chose to get married. You should be asking how to compromise with him to get him to travel a little with you rather than you travel without him. "
30,"Agree with the other top posters here, but want to add: your husband doesn't sound like a good boss. If he talks to his employees the way he texted you, then he's not winning any friends. A good mentor coaches you because they realize you are an investment in a mutual future, what your husband did was simply try to make you feel guilt/shame, which is not constructive.

Perhaps have him take a few courses or read a few books on how to be a better boss. It may have more wide-reaching effects."
31,There's no way that they're going to refund OP any money based on something that an administrative assistant who has nothing to do with  managing the company insurance plans said.  He might as well claim the mailman told him he couldn't drop it.
32,"?? Are we speaking of The Gift of Fear? If so, have you actually read the book? It's actually quite explicit about how paranoia  and being constantly fearful/suspicious is NOT conducive to safety because it blinds you to those moments when your gut really IS telling you something. I found, after reading it, that I felt much less fearful in general, and much more confident about trusting my own instincts."
33,"So so proud of you for doing this OP, it is way harder than people think but absolutely worth it. You're doing the right thing 100%. All the best to you. "
34,Calling the authorities is the only option. Tell your dad to think less about the relationship with his sister (who has brought this on herself anyway) and more about the future relationship with his niece and nephew (who may one day grow up and realise that their whole family stood by and allowed their mother to abuse them). Everyone needs to be calling DCFS here for the sake of those children.
35,"I have a vegan kid who is not at all malnourished - we're not gluten-free, but still, you can feed your kids a ""restrictive"" diet without them ending up in hospital. Though in our case we eat dairy-free ice cream and stuff, which it sounds like your aunt is banning her kids from having for whatever readon.

It sounds like she's got them on some weird, dangerous ""medicinal"" bullshit diet. No fat, no sugar, no anything. Some of these ""alternative medicine"" types are basically conspiracy theorists who believe all kinds of ridiculous stuff about food, nutrition and medicine, but because it's all a conspiracy they can't be reasoned with. There is no way of persuading your aunt that she is actually harming her children rather than doing what's best for them. I really hate to suggest reporting her to CPS, but those kids could die. Aside from the malnourishment, what if they got sick and she wouldn't get them checked out until it was too late? Illnesses like meningitis can kill very quickly. I'm assuming they're unvaccinated too, which is a risk to their health."
36,So what's the acceptable bodyweight for a female again? Seems like I lost that part of the instructions that came with my vagina.
37,"Bodybuilding is more aesthetic based, while powerlifting is more about strengths in 3 lifts (squat, bench, deadlift). "
38,"^ this. Emphasize what you said about leaving was your choice. And that since the incident you've had a change of perspective. And it turns out alot of what she said during the argument were things you needed to hear.

Then stress that, You're here, alive and well, she wont lose you, unless she chooses to push you away like she is now and that would be the most tragic thing in this scenario."
39,"&gt;  They would have to buy him out to move it.

But OP doesn't have to do the same?"
40,"you're premed, but you're also... 19. so you've taken, what, an intro course?

 the thing is, even intro to psych will tell you that while behavioural traits are due in part to genetic predisposition, environment plays a much larger role in how those traits present themselves. and inheritance of intelligence is not, in fact, well established - academics and professionals in the field of psychology have a difficult time even agreeing on the definition of intelligence, not to mention its usefulness as a metric for human value.

 this anti-adoption attitude is based on some untrue classist BS that i can't imagine any accredited professor spewing in front of a classroom if they want to keep their tenure, so i'm wondering who influenced this opinion of yours.

perhaps a 30 year old man trying to lock down a teenage bride?"
41,"&gt; probably by one of her closest family members.

Or more likely it was hired staff or any random person near or in the venue who saw a chance."
42,"Yeah, you need to tell your friend.  She's legit fucked up."
43,"I know this is what is crazy to me and is making OP seem unreasonable. Neither of them seem like bad people, they are just going through a new transition in their life. But to throw everything away when it can be solved by putting in a little more effort seems so weird. 


I am in a very similar situation to OP's gf, except that I have been vegetarian my entire life. My bf is a huuuge meat eater while I am very strict with my vegetarianism. But we work around it. We love each other so we compromise. "
44,"At first I thought this was my roommate making a post about me. Except he's a decent person, who actually knocks on my door to see if I'm okay. Good god dude. "
45,"TBH the children will thank you for protecting them from toxic family members, I do in my case."
46,"Well, it's making YOU uncomfortable and you are the one that actually lives in the dorm. I think you should speak to your roommate about not letting him just hang out in the room when she's not there. If you're too uncomfortable or nervous to do that, ask your RA to help mediate the discussion. "
47,You're right and I didn't mean to sound so judgmental. Its also doubly hard to extricate yourself when you're dealing with people like OP's mom who I'm guessing just assumes everything OP does will be run by her. 
48,"Also, OP caliming she's ""not your typical 21 y.o."" sounds like a product of manipulative older guy trying to convince her."
49,Tell everyone. They should know that Dave is a colossal jackass. 
50,Your edit does not make me feel better about the situation at all...
51,"You are who you tolerate / hang out with.

52,"No, text him saying she'll be 20 minutes late, then text after 25 that it'll be another 10.  Then block him forever."

55,So her continuing to have a life after a break up and you seeing a picture of her with friends after you are looking through their pages sends you into this much of a rage? Dude I think you might need help  with your anger issues...
56,"&gt;So Roy called me today and goes back and forth between irate and crying, I was there as best as I could be, reminding him to breath and tried to calm him down by talking about the wedding we are going to this weekend. I ask what's going to happened with him and Chris when he goes home to see his folks and all he could say was he isn't sure, it'll be bad but he's not sure. I asked if he planned on fighting Chris and Roy said yes, that he intends on finally giving Chris ""what he deserves"" 

Chris is a horrible asshole, but please try to keep Roy from physically fighting him.  He's not worth going to jail over.  

Maybe Roy can stay at your place until Chris is out of his parents' house?  Also, i think Roy should tell his parents that Chris is dead to him.  And his parents deserve a giant ""fuck you"" for enabling Chris to get away with shit for so many years.

63,"I have a bit of a story for you. 

One of my older cousins got married around 8 or 9 years ago I believe? Anyway, she got married to this guy that she absolutely loved, fell head over heals in love with. They were together from 24 to 29 years old. The relationship slowly failed overtime, and it seemed like one person (my cousin) was putting in all the work. It wasn't until after being together 5 or 6 years (I believe), that she found it she was her ex-husbands *backup* option. This devastated her beyond belief.

The relationship was strained, which led to her getting a divorce. Guess what? She just got remarried to an **amazing** man, who is absolutely head over heals in love with her. Her new husband got screwed around on in his first marriage, and she was in a marriage where he ex-husband considered her ""2nd"" prize. I hope you get something out of this little story. But, this women isn't ""the one"", not even close.  "

67,"So you let your daughter live in filth because you feel she's taking advantage of you? What on earth is the matter with you, OP? Have you heard cutting off your nose to spite your face? You're harming your child in order to prove a point to your wife. 

If you call DCFS they'll probably take her away from both of you, which might be in your best interest since you're willing to let her suffer in order to get at your wife.

Actually kicking puppies or supporting someone who admits to kicking puppies are equally shitty behaviors.

I really don't mean my comment in any judgmental way at all I am accepting of all, it might be useful to have an open conversation about your sexuality. While low sex drive can be associated with A-sexuality it is mostly no sex drive or attraction at all, this is the only reason I ask. What drew you to your SO to begin with? "
77,"You should definitely continue seeking professional help. This is all far above Reddits pay grade. 

You're having issues with relationships, have a lot of anxiety, and suffer from an eating disorder with a history of depression and suicidal thoughts. Again, seek professional help. Ongoing help doesn't reflect negatively upon you, it will only help you and the relationships you develop in the future.

In the meantime, remember that you cannot control anyone's behavior but your own. You can't force a relationship that isn't there but you can talk to someone about it.

"
78,"Um.... Yeah it's unappealing to be used as a fleshlight... If he doesn't want to put in the work to be intimate, he doesn't get intimacy. Not putting in the work and still expecting to get what you want is something most children grow out of past high school. Of course the most offensive thing about this is that spending time with you is work so even if you for him to do it, you'd be aware it's something he's only doing to get sex. Which brings you back to being his fleshlight. Just leave this completely disrespectful and uncaring jerk.    "
79,"&gt;And this is why you don't split furniture.

The real lesson here"
80,"He's using his coworkers as an excuse. Do you seriously believe that they'd look down on the fact that he's doing long distance with a girl he's been with for *6 years* due to career opportunities? He wants intimacy (and likely sex) with other girls while you're apart, but he doesn't have the balls to dump you. Your relationship is a safety net for him at this point.

I wouldn't be surprised if he's been doing this for 3 years and is just now making up this coworkers story to try and cover his ass before you move back in."
81,"He's hoping to just wait out your biological clock. He figures he'll either be hit by this mystical parenting urge so many people seem to have, or he won't and it'll just become too late anyway and either way he wins... But one of those ways, you lose.

To put this in a different perspective, I never want kids - and it would be an absolute dealbreaker for me if my partner expected me to just wait around for them to decide whether I'm good enough for them or if having kids is more important.

In your situation you cannot accept a ""maybe"" anymore than I can. I understand a lot of people are not firmly decided and don't see the need to be, but I can't plan a future around them because I don't want an obvious ax hanging over my head. They need to take my stance seriously and appreciate it because I am not likely to change my mind. Similarly for you, you need someone for whom having kids is a **priority** that they will make space for. Your SO is right in that you never know what life will throw at you and maybe circumstances will change the course of it in huge ways - but that's not a reason to just never have a priority/preference/decision related to the future. "

83,Me and my ex wife slept in separate bedrooms the last 5 years of our marriage. it can have nothing to do with the health of the relationship or have a whole lot to do with the health of it. 
84,"&gt; So if I asked I might get an answer which I am tolerant yet uncomfortable with. 

Mate, it kind of sounds like you'd just rather not know the answer in case it's not one that you want to hear. If you like this girl, the thing to do would be to err on the side of caution and ask what her expectation are - rather than doing what you want and then hoping that she's on the same page.

Having said that, if you do decide to pursue a relationship with her and she retrospectively finds out about your sexcapades and it turns out that she's not okay with them, no amount of ""but we didn't *define* the relationship"" is going to dig you out of that hole. Given that she hasn't slept with anyone else in nine months, I'm guessing you two have somewhat different approaches to dating and the associated expectations.

As a disclaimer, I assume you're in the US and I think dating culture there is quite different to the UK."
85,"I don't think, unfortunately, this is one you can make happen by yourself. All the talking in the world will make no difference until she has the epiphany where she wants to lose weight for herself. She's already 100lbs overweight (at least right, if thats 100lbs more than you?) so she knows she's fat. That so far hasn't been enough.

You talking to her about it will probably only make her resent you. She's looking at your success and while happy for you, she's probably also like ""well it was easy for him, because REASONS"". So she'll lie to herself and dismiss anything you say even if it is valid.

Honestly, all you can do is tell her honestly that you want to be able to grow old together, you're scared that she won't be there the way she is going, and is there anyway to work together on this. Lead her but let her make the decision for herself. Don't nag her if she ""slips up"" - she knows. Just keep showing her the next healthy meal, the next walk around the block, or work out at the gym. Hopefully she will build up the discipline to make changes she needs. But seriously, you can't do this for her.

So at some point you need to draw your line and hold her (and yourself) to it, which may involve walking away if needed. "
86,"A lot of people will disagree, but I agree with you. When it comes to being a parent and losing a child there's no place for logic. I absolutely agree that I feel I would have no purpose or reason to carry on. Why bother with the suffering and therapy and trying to cope? 'I'm done' is right. "
87,"&gt; she explained why the prank failed

The prank failed because it was inherently fucking dangerous. This girl sounds like a lunatic."
88,"Honestly, that's even dumber. If she thought it wasn't acid, what did she think it was? ""It's probably not acid, better just take it!"""
89,"&gt; I think there is only one main factor here, your love is conditional

All love is conditional ya dingus - or perhaps better said, relationships are conditional.

What do you think standards are? (hint: they're conditions for a relationship.) Would you also say that people aren't allowed to have standards?"
90,"It was probably noted in the police officers' report that there was a video that the perp made and that the cops made her delete it.

91,"Exactly -- she could be the unicorn that flirts with a guy in front of her new bf but has every intention of being 100% platonic and faithful while staying with that dude in a hotel for 2 weeks.

92,"I may be off base here, but dude, this woman seems to have an inordinate amount of baggage.  Is this person someone you *really* love and want to spend your life with?  I know she's fighting the good fight now, but I imagine you're going to end up the primary bread winner in the very near future.

That being said, I don't think it is reasonable for her to ask you to skip on the premise of ""I hate that you can go and I can't, boo me"".  "
93,"I've had family members say if they lived through my loss they'd kill themselves. It makes me angry because I feel like what they are saying is they love their kids more and better than I do because I've somehow, eventually figured out how to keep going. It's really not something that's helpful when someone is trying to keep going, or slowly going numb and wasting away. You'd be surprised what you can handle when it happens. "
94,"She started the bad blood not you, she's the bad guy, not you. 

I don't know why you'd want to keep things neutral, she just essentially stole $100 from you.  If you explain it to your friend group they'd all take your side. 

You can obviously handle this however you want, but I wouldn't let this drop. "
95,"I mean, for me, it'd be unfixable. Trust is the foundation of a relationship, and if my husband thought I cheated on him, I'd be done. I'm a trustworthy person, and I deserve to be trusted. I would insist on the paternity test, too, but I also wouldn't want to be with a man who didn't trust me, or who was so easily influenced to doubt my character by his friends. 

And if he pulled this shit *while I was growing his fucking baby*?? When I was already nervous about childbirth and tearing and experiencing pregnancy symptoms? Yeah. I'd be out. "
96,"A random suggestion here... How about trying one of those etiquette coaches parents hire when desperately trying to turn their teenage kids into acceptable human beings? 

Edite  to add ... Look for a relationship coach. A good one will be a coach and a therapist and will meet clients 'where they are at'. I have a client who is a relationship coach. With some people she just gives them behavior changes to work on. With others who need it, she gets into the therapy of why /how they need to change."
97,"Read what she actually says about it:

&gt;now that i look back on it and reassess the whole situation. Also i felt a little pressured by him to have sex

Does this sound like someone who was actually coerced into having sex? Or does it sound like someone from a religious upbringing who had a bad experience with sex her first time - had already destroyed the relationship - and is trying to rationalize that it's not her fault?"

99,"Your Point 3 seriously got me in the heart. I'm Caucasian and my best friend is half-Chinese. The first time I ever heard a racist remark directed towards someone is when we were walking together in school when we were 14 (We're 23 now) and I was so shocked that I was stunned. My friend shrugged and said, ""Yeah, that happens sometimes."" Last year her mum was working and was verbally abused and had dirty tissues thrown at her while the person yelled racist shit at her and her mum went home crying. When I found out I started crying too. I've never been a victim to a racist attack but I can't imagine lacking the empathy to be completely disgusted when you see or hear about it happening to the people you love. "

103,"*This is not about you*.  Right now, if you want to be a good partner, put aside the fact that your feelings are hurt by his lack of attention and put aside the fact that you don't have all the answers you want RIGHT NOW and support your boyfriend.  He is young.  His mother is dying.  He doesn't know what to do, how to do it, what he should feel, or how to move forward.  He has already apologized to you and told you that he is a mess.  Take him at his word and stop expecting things from him right now.

108,"I don't like this ""drop it"" thing. My husband and I have yelled and lost our tempers with each other plenty of time, however, I cannot even fathom either of us telling the other to drop it indefinitely and not resolve it. His behavior sounds super sketchy and like he's hiding something. My advice is to not drop it and tell him so, as in ""Actually no, I won't drop it. I need to discuss this with you."""

113,"The odds of the test being wrong are next to none. 

You can answer the question of which one is ""the product of a sperm donor"" by looking at your other cousin matches to see if any of them share your dad's family (just look at the first page of the matches and check their family trees). You might also want to look at your ethnicity results to see if they fit what you know about your father's family, and assess your other half-siblings' ethnicity results with the same goal.

If that doesn't help, and you're not ready to talk to your parents about this, you could buy your dad a DNA kit from the same company and have him take it in front of you, ""so I can put it in the mail right away"". When his results come in, either you and your half-sister will both show on his match page or neither of you will.

You are very, very much not alone in this. This happens to a lot of people who take DNA tests, usually just for fun, and learn that one or both parents aren't genetically their parent. I'm sorry you're having to deal with this."

126,"I think it's too early to say though my gut says he may have issues making room for another person.  What you can do is figure out, before you get too emotionally involved, your personal limits.  How long could you see yourself giving him?  Another two months or up to six months total?  

And make sure you two are on the same page about dating exclusively or not."
127,"&gt;For one, I've always thought it was just heaping additional burdens on the people around me.

Is this what you feel that your girlfriend does when she opens up to you about her problems or fears?"
128,"A. Why are they staying in the same room? I mean usually people try to avoid situations where problems could arise.  
B. I am sorry but someone who has feelings for someone for that many years does not just have them ""go away"".  
I honestly think both yourself and your wife are being naive, but hey in this day it seems if you even express concerns you are labeled controlling.  
Kudos for trusting your wife so much.  
I know I would be uncomfortable as hell with this, especially sharing a room."
129,"Who has the final say about what goes out? Who has the responsibility here? Personally, if I were running things, the buck would stop with you - your job is to edit and if it's edited poorly, that's on you. She doesn't get veto power if she's wrong. However, I have no idea how this works at your company.

Does it reflect poorly on you that her work isn't up to par?  I have to imagine so, and if that's true, you have to do it despite her protests. If you have the responsibility to ensure communications are well-written and professional, you need to also have the authority to decide ""this is what we're sending out"". I guarantee your boss does not want you to weasel out of that responsibility at the first hint of disagreement.

If you have that responsibility without that authority, you're a sucker. Go talk to your boss and make it clear that, if you're responsible for team communications, then you need the authority to have the final say on what goes out."
130,Her relationship is not even REMOTELY ready for marriage if she needs the internet's advice on this.
131,"Try not to be too defensive, the person above you was giving you genuine advice that I personally agree with. They are not saying sequester yourself until you are normal, they are saying don't wait until you are in a relationship to start addressing your issues. You can't expect a new person to ""help"" you through your personal issues. Normal people are not therapists, they are not equipped to handle emotional issues like that. You do need to wait until you have worked on yourself enough to be a partner in a relationship, not relying on someone else for emotional stability.

Moving forward, I think you will have to do a lot of introspection, and defensiveness will not be beneficial to you when trying to develop healthy relationships. There are going to be times when your partner will criticize you for behaviors that are rooted in your past trauma. If you want things to work, you will need the skill of listening to criticism or advice that you don't necessarily like without lashing out or getting angry."
132,"He went looking for her in particular, then told you about it. That's the most pathetic cheating i can imagine. Can you ever trust him and your best friend again? Sheesh. Girl, get some self respect.  Dump him and find someone who dreams about you."
133,"What exactly makes you uncomfortable with it? 

OP, you say you're more conservative, so I'll let you in on a little secret: some guys get amazing orgasms from stimulating their prostate. The only way to stimulate the prostate is through the thin skin inside the rectum. While I've never tried it, I hear these orgasms can be better than any through penile stimulation. Your boyfriend just wants to feel good. That doesn't make him gay or a bad person. "
134,"I think postponement and pre-marital counseling are in order.  I think you might find out that other people are upset with her behavior too, like her parents. Ana is way to focus on being bride and not a wife/ partner or being part of a family.  Ana needs to remember a wedding is one day and a marriage is suppose to be forever.  It is not worth burning bridges with beloved family over a day and minor inconviences.  "

Where will you guys be living - mexico or the US?  That could be a huge factor.

138,Absolutely tell your dad. Then stay out. Seems like your mom had an affair and tried to end things.

1. He had a lot of baggage compared to her considering his extended past. 

2. 21 is the age that people usually start to find themselves and party, etc etc..

There's a difference between ""You're disgusting and should be ashamed of yourself for that, good riddance"" and ""Hey, your choices are your own and there's nothing wrong with them, I'm just not into that and don't see myself being with someone who is."""

152,"This answer to your post and the following thread is really cruel, OP, and you should not listen to these people if you still value your friendship at least a little bit. As others suggested he probably feels like he's losing you and wants to feel closer to you by doing the same things as you, so maybe you can share more experiences in his eyes, and he considers you a good role model. Yes, he's taking it a bit too far, but just kicking him out of the wedding without explanation or any consideration for his feelings or your past is immature and cold af. It's not like it's your obligation to be friends with him, but you should realize this is going to hurt his feelings in a pretty serious way. People get traumatized like this. Just sayin'. :/"

160,"Sucking on dildos like lollipops is definitely strange, but as long as it's not harmful to your health and you're not randomly whipping them out in public when you get stressed, it shouldn't be too much of an issue. 

I *would* encourage you to seek therapy, because abnormal expressions of stress--especially sexual expressions--tend to come from some sort of unhealthy place. But that's on you if you'd like to pursue it.

No, there's no way to get your girlfriend to see this as *normal,* because it's not a normal method of coping with stress. It might be possible to get her to see it as *acceptable,* because as long as it's not hurting anyone it should be acceptable. Point out that it's not hurting anyone, make sure not to do it when it would be inappropriate to do so, and maybe do it in private if she dislikes it that much. Maybe sometimes try to replace the dildo with something else--like a lollipop--if you're interested in compromising with her on this.

171,"Ok - Firstly - Destroy that diary. Hardcopies can be used against you and are an on-going source for the person snooping. When destroying it don't just drop it in the bin as they could find it. Utterly annihilate it. Take each page out and tear up very fine, then dispose of in multiple public bins. Don't give her ammo.

Secondly - Secure your IT stuff. Phone, laptop, tablets. Change all your passwords. 

Thirdly - You aren't going to convince your father. You aren't going to win over the woman. There is nothing you can do to resolve this as he's bought into her bullshit and she's set against you as an obstacle to her getting him 24/7. So instead put your energies into working/studying and finding alternate place to live as soon as you're capable of supporting yourself. Don't be mean/awkward or anything to him or her, just let it breeze past you and focus on something else. The reality is he's going to have a life with her but that doesn't mean you have to have a life with her. 

Also - if you do get a chance to ""pop out"" again make sure you record/photo things/evidence if you suspect she's seeing someone else and you witness it again. Don't show her or your dad, don't even confront either of them or mention it. Keep it as evidence is all. 

Your dad doesn't need your protection; you've warned him, spoken to him and done as much as you can do and as much as he's willing to entertain or believe. If he's walking into a situation where she's going to rip him off or break his heart? Tough. He has to learn and he's old enough to know better or at least have some kind of reflection on his situation. If he doesn't then, well, he needs to learn that lesson.

Keep yourself to yourself, keep you things secure and private, remain calm, nice and very beige, don't argue or anything. If you persist in trying ""convince"" your father it'll only embolden the woman and raise his ire. If it's already at the point that he was contemplating striking you over an accusation then he either buys into her shit 100% or he suspects her himself and didn't like that fact you're also aware; because to do nothing would look weak. He won't want to look like a doormat but similarly he doesn't want to be alone either. 

Tough situation. Your best best would be to find an alternate place to live and have very, very little to do with your father and his new partner."
172,Maybe it's like living at a nudist colony. You just get used to it?
173,"This honestly could have been written by me. I just ended a relationship exactly like this. Jealousy over everything, even if I thought FOR SURE there was no way she could be jealous over that specific subject. 

One time we had gone out to a cool restaurant in the city which had fancy drinks that everyone knows about. I took a picture of it and sent it to a few friends from work and she instantly got upset and put us both in a bad mood because some of those people were girls. 

Just get out while you can, I stuck through it for a year always thinking it would improve but it never did... "
174,"Well, you stop whining that your Dad takes the safety of a 6-year-old child in his home seriously, and not say incredibly immature and hateful things like ""not even his real child"".

Then you ask your Dad, calmly and respectfully, what he thinks you should have done differently to prevent this accident. If he has answers, promise to do as he asks, to keep the child safe in the home you all share. If he doesn't, point out it maybe isn't your fault if it was a random accident that even he doesn't think could be prevented because kids do dumb shit sometimes...

EDIT: You two were in charge of supervising him while the rest of the family was out. You didn't supervise him. Punishment is a normal consequences for not doing a normal, expected family chore like watching a little brother for a while."

176,"I'm not sure how to help, but I just wanted to say that it's great that you're not making excuses and are owning up to your behavior. 

An idea. You could respond to him via email, acknowledging that you did all that, and apologizing sincerely, telling him that you are mortified that you never noticed your own shitty behavior. You could even mention that you clearly have a lot to work through, and will be taking steps to find the source and work on improving yourself. You deeply regret not being involved more, and while you would like to work on your relationship, you will give him whatever space he would like/respect whatever boundaries he has. "
177,"Yeah, I don't want to stereotype here, but generally a guy who is attracted to women doesn't think about sex as... ""an adventure""? 

It sounds like he might be depressed, honestly, and wants to find a partner but is having problems with finding a long-term relationship with a man. Anyway, unfortunately you're going to have to cut back on the friendship (unless you're interested in a completely platonic marriage?)"
178,"And it can be a surprise. But having this conversation with your fiance is important. ""hey hon, Joe said he was going to get strippers and I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that for xyz. What do you think?"" "
179,"How long has he been ""sleeping in"" til late and working til late?

Seems a bit strange to me; working hours are usually fixed?

prefers to sleep in til 11 and work all day and night, and now seems like he is finding reasons to be mad at you, and not showing you love. 

These are signs that he may be prioritising something else.. or someone else over you, and his own guilt is projecting onto you. I could be wrong here, but this seems odd to me."

184,"So I'll start with the obvious; have you talked to your doctor about trying other anti-depressants?

There are several different classes of medication used to treat depression, the most common being SSRI's, and Prozac is an SSRI. One of the most common side effects of SSRI's includes the sexual side effects you're describing. You can try a different SSRI, or try a different class of anti-depressant entirely.

Please just talk to your doc, be honest about side effects, and see what she/he recommends you try instead. **It is 100% normal, appropriate, and legal for you to specifically request to NOT take a medication, or to ask for a specific one you'd like to try.** A lot of people get nervous about that because they feel like they're drug-seeking or contradicting their doctor, but that's not it at all. You should be totally open with your doc ""I really liked how Prozac helped my mood/energy level/etc, but the sexual side effects (describe them) were too much for me to handle. What else can we try/can we try drugXYZ that I read about?""

Depression is a journey. A shitty, tough, journey. It can take several tries to find a medication that works, and that's frustrating. But you owe it to yourself to do everything you can to make yourself happy, and when you are sick (depression is an illness) you need to receive treatment."

187,"It's honestly probably even more innocuous. But yeah, all these people in the thread are telling her to cut ties with her best friend, kick him out of the wedding, or fuck with him. They're all clearly mean spirited children. The guy is young and struggling to figure it out. His friend had some cool ideas that he copied. The veganism was a bit odd.

190,"He's being a responsible father to his kids. A divorce is not only hard on the adults, it can be even more traumatizing for the children. Waiting til after the divorce to introduce someone new is a very good idea. And even if things are officially over between him and his wife, the kids might actually blame you for the divorce depending on how much they know of the situation. 

You didn't mention how old the kids are, and do you have kids of your own? 

If you decide you want to date him, you need to come to terms with the fact that he's a single father, and not just a single guy. Him and his kids come together in a package, and if you can't accept that, you shouldn't be dating him. It seems he got too wrapped up with the idea of dating you at first, and forgot to consider his children. Spending that Christmas together after knowing each other for what, 2-3 months at the time? would not have been a good idea. I get that you're hurt, but you need to take it slow. Even now, you still have the option to date him and see him most week nights and every other weekend. But seems like you don't want to unless he includes you in his children's lives, which is unreasonable on your part. "

So you are basically paying for him to stay home and jack off all day? Why does this guy not have a job?

&gt;going to bed at four or five (when I'm leaving the house for work), sleeping until noon or later daily, not interested in physical intimacy (either sex or even snuggling/cuddling)

What exactly do YOU get out of this relationship? It sounds like you are in a relationship with a 14 year old boy. You deserve better than this. You can't expect him to get better, get a job, etc. while allowing him to get comfortable with this current lifestyle. Is there even an expectation for him to do something with his life?"
199,Such a strong move!! You should be so proud of yourself!!
200,"That's because you've never been to one, probably. It's like at someone's house it's not at synagogue or anything. It's like a tradition of telling the story of Passover and reading certain stories and songs that tell us why we are celebrating and throughout you eat different pieces and then you get to eat the full meal. It's weird because Judaism is a culture as well as a religion so it's not quite as simple as a dinner but not as religious as an actual service. It's the traditional telling of the Passover story during a dinner context of having friends and family together to celebrate. There is also a tradition of having a newcomer learn about the story. So I feel like the expectation is quite different than asking someone to attend church services with you on Easter. Then again, it's not my family and it's not my decision, so op has to weigh her options and do what's best for her and her family

Edit: it's more similar to like singing Christmas carols and stuff like that, I would say, more than a Christmas church service"

Maybe you do need to date someone smarter but mostly what I'm getting is that you need to deal with your past- like maybe even some PTSD therapy? You have equated smart with safe and that doesn't hold up over time. (If anything, imo, kind + mindful equals safe.)

EDIT: Also, smart isn't the same as interested, I don't think. You might just need to date someone who's interested in things.

205,"Ha ha ha I had one of these too! Where do they come from and where do they get their ideas about what constitutes a relationship? 

In my case, it was this guy about 12 years older than me who I'd see out at various friends' houses and local bars. He would sometimes bring me a drink (not that I asked him to) or offer me a ride home (again, I would never ask, but he would offer, he didn't live far from me, and it beat waiting for the bus in the rain.) 

One day I came to his house because he was getting a medical procedure he'd be too doped up to drive home from. He'd asked me to drive him back from the doctor's. I was looking around his living room and he had a bunch of framed pictures of us together that had been snapped at the aforementioned parties and bars. He'd printed them out and framed them, for real.

""Bob,"" I said, ""Anyone who came into your house would think that I'm your girlfriend. Do you think I'm your girlfriend?"" 

Yes, Bob did. Bob thought, somehow, that what we had was a committed romantic relationship. We had never even kissed."

210,"&gt; it just bothers me so much that he could just cut of his mother so easily like that

This response makes me angry. Not all parents are good people. Your husband has every right to cut out someone who is behaving poorly to his spouse  (and him!), even if it's his own mother.

Perhaps because you grew up without parents, you have this idealized notion on how ""sacred"" the bond is. That parents always love their children and know exactly what's best for them all the time. That's a fantasy. A nice fantasy, but a fantasy nonetheless. This is reality: sometimes awful people procreate. There are parents that beat and verbally abuse their kids. There are control freaks that flip out any time their kid tries to get out from under their thumb. There are parents who sexually abuse their kids, who care more about drugs than their own children, who never have money for diapers but always have money for booze. Sometimes awful people are relatively good parents, in the sense that their children are provided for, but they are still nasty and controlling in other ways. Those kids sometimes grow up to be awful people themselves, but other times they grow up and become good people like your husband. 

The bond between parent and child is not sacred. History has proven this over and over again. What your husband is doing, this distance HE is putting between you two and his mother, is the HEALTHIEST thing he can do right now. What you are suggesting IS NOT HEALTHY. Your romanticized notion on how he *should* behave towards her is quite frankly disrespectful towards him. This is his mother, not yours. Don't put all your own wishes about how you think your own relationship between you and your late mother could have been on him. That's not fair to him.

I really think you should consider therapy. You clearly have some issues to work out regarding your passivity and trying to please everyone. In the meantime, back off and let your husband decide how much contact he wants with his mother. Don't decide for him, that's just rude. Grow a backbone and tell your grandparents why she's not coming to the BBQ's. Like another poster said: YOU are the one causing more drama here by not accepting this situation for what it is. "
211,"I'd say your relationship is the exception. Most relationships I've seen and been in consist of two people who care about what the other is doing.

So, you sound a bit like my husband, but (hopefully) not as bad.

After our second, I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia due to a botched C-Section. Sex straight up hurt. Orgasms hurt. And I felt miserable because I know he needed satisfaction, and I wasn't able to provide it. Unlike your wife, I gave him permission to find an outlet, but he never took me up on it.

It's reasonable to assume that some stuff got lost in this game of telephone, and you don't know how your uncle presented things to them.

Equal opportunity parenting, please) might need at least 1 additional person for assistance. Either way, part of the issue was you doing this second-hand, so contact them yourself.

234,"Sounds like he's losing control. That or he's now so confident that she'll stay/no one will be able to help her that he doesn't care who knows. 

It's a dangerous time for her, but also has the highest likelihood of prompting her to leave. At least one other person now knows what he does to her in private and it'll be harder for him to convince her that she's overreacting/misinterpreting what's happening. Someone else has peeked behind the curtain and does not think she's the crazy one.

Even if you don't see it now, you've done her a huge service by simply acknowledging that his behavior 1. is really happening, and 2. is unacceptable to you. So many people trapped in these relationships lose their ability to tell up from down because their abuser defines reality *for* them. You just made it more difficult for him to do that."

Don't get me wrong -- I know there are children out there who are fully aware of the stress they give their parents and have no problem continually doing stuff that will eventually give their parents nervous breakdowns, but I don't see that happening with this kid in particular, from what OP has said.

You're saying he should casually date her until they're in their mid-40s and then dump her like a hot potato as soon as her looks start to fade?!  What weird and selfish advice!  

If he only wants a girlfriend for sex, he should keep it casual and short-term (which is already moot in this case, since they live together); he shouldn't keep her on the hook indefinitely and ruin her chances of finding someone who would actually love her for who she is.  On the other hand, if he wants a life partner, he should find someone he can actually respect and have a deeper connection with for the long term."
239,"&gt; I'm so confused-- is it because curly hair is not an Asian trait so they think it's ugly? Just to piss me off and show their disdain? An act of anger against a baby for being naughty? Literally marking her ownership and power over her? I'm even wondering if dementia is kicking in.

243,"I always agree with this quote: ""Any relationship that could be “ruined” by having a conversation about feelings, standards, or expectations wasn’t really firm enough anyway, so there isn’t much to ruin.""

Your now-ex needs to work on himself and therapy. Passively being in a relationship with you isn't going to magically heal his trauma down the line. The relationship you have/ had with him is not firm, but very brittle. That's why it broke so easily when you were only doing something that is normal. 

You should tell him, ""Hey, I really care about you and think you need time and space to heal from your last relationship. Therapy would be a good option. I won't wait around, but let me know if you need any help."" And then find someone else who doesn't have that much emotional baggage."

I'm sure she could point out something unattractive on your body. To your questions, you can't repair this. The damage is done. Honestly, she should leave you."
250,Just because you love him isn't a good enough reason to stay. It's not worth all the heartache you'll go through again and again. He was in a relationship with someone else while you were together. There are so many people in the world that will treat you better. You deserve better.

But now she's compromising you and your relationships, and she's not doing it for any logical reason -- mental health or no, that's shitty behaviour. Moreover, it's *harmful*. To you.

You need to put stopping yourself from being harmed first here. There's no shame in that, it's the right choice to ensure your own health and well-being.

My bestfriend and fiance are poly. It works extremely well for them. She has a boyfriend and he happens to be her fiance's best friend. But there is no insecurities.  I'm bisexual so I was always interested in the idea of being Poly. I'm an extremely open minded woman so I figured I could do it. 

Nope, wrong. I'm just not wired that way. Jealousy is a big deal to me and I also need to be the only person someone lusts after (and that just wouldn't be fair in a poly relationship). So I'm sticking with being monogamous.

And, as far as other posters go, there are *plenty* of countries a woman can travel alone to these days, in perfect safety. If he was really concerned about her safety, he would be offering to go as well. "

287,"&gt; Your advice is: let your life pass you by because your husband is upset.

No, my advice is pick one or the other. I don't think she should let life pass her by, but if that's what she wants, she should find a partner better aligned with that goal.

I'm not telling her which one to pick, just saying she needs to pick. If she wants to travel,go for it. But if your life's dream is to travel, you'd better marry someone who likes traveling (or is at a baseline, ok with you being gone), otherwise you run into OPs situation.

There are some things you need to have in common with an SO. Kids, marriage, goals, etc. Traveling this much qualifies. The couple might be able to paper over it for awhile, but eventually it's going to build resentment.

&gt;A few weeks in a year won't kill the OPs partner.

No, but for a lot of people it's not insignificant, either. There's a lot of things that won't ""kill"" your partner, but are enough to break up over.

&gt;he can handle being without his wife for a few weeks, she is not disappearing

There's a big difference between what someone *can* handle, and whether they *want* to, though. Especially when it's optional. I'm not saying he can't. Every marriage has minor disagreements, and requires compromise. This isn't a minor one. It might be for OP, it might be for you, but not for everyone (and it seems clear her husband is in this category).

Many partners would put up with a hell of a lot before leaving- it doesn't always mean they should. If you base your choices on whether it's far enough past your partner's boundaries to leave, you don't have a healthy relationship.

&gt;He is saying that she isn't happy because she wants to travel and do other things with her life

She isn't happy, or she wouldn't be here. There's no way for her to have both of the things she wants without at the minimum, hurting her husband significantly (which presumably, matters a lot).

That means she has 3 choices. Travel, husband, or  travel and hurt husband and not care.I don't think option 3 is a good choice if she wants to maintain a healthy marriage. Husband *might* stick around, but it's still a bad choice. Being married shouldn't make you miserable.
"
288,"Eh, it's weird if he doesn't do it with any other friends."
289,"I've lost family to suicide and been there myself. And despite all that I still think it's shitty to minimize her depression because she has a ""nice life"". 

Could she maybe have waited to tell that? Sure. But she was drunk and depressed and maybe she wanted some comfort. Maybe she was scared she was going to end up like your cousin's girlfriend. Jumping down her throat is just going to make it harder for her to open up about her mental health later. "
290,Tell your parents immediately.
291,"""A thief thinks everyone steals."""
292,"I go out to work all day and have a fairly intellectually demanding job.  My wife stays at home with our two year old.  Who do you think has the harder 'job'?  

One isn't better or worse than the other, they are just different.  Having the emotional energy to keep a 2yo alive day after day despite their best efforts and help shape their little minds all while not getting a single minute to yourself (unless they are asleep, in which case you try to cram 3 hours worth of chores into 1).

Ask yourself this:  If being intentionally and thoughtfully giving to your GF is as easy as you are making it out to be, why not just do it for a month?  See how it goes?"
293,I know you want to have a normal relationship but it's not going to happen with this woman. 
294,"Can you explain how they accidentally started a fire?  Those are not young ages, they should know better....Were they smoking or some other crap?

What has your step-siblings done to make up for it? Have they truly apologized? Have they done anything to help? Have they offered money to buy replacements?  Have they offered to take you shopping to get replacements?  Tell your dad that you can't and won't forgive them until THEY actually come and make good faith efforts to DESERVE it.  It's not your dad's place to ask for them.

Second, In this case, your oldest step-sibling should have to move out...He's 18, he can fend for himself with family for a while.  They can't just cart you off for convenience sake.  If this shit happened to me and it was truly an accident, I'd be bending over backwards trying to figure out how to fix it up to and including giving up my room."
295,"What kind of boundaries is she setting with them? 

You have to remember that if you ""step in"", you'll basically confirm their view. It really doesn't matter whether they're wrong or right,  they'll feel vindicated. 

Take the lead from her. Talk about it with your wife,  not her nasty friends."
296,"&gt; So you're saying I should further jeopardize my health so that she can take advantage of me?

We are saying you are responsible for your kids just as much as she is. 

This isn't all about you. It's about your *children.*

298,"&gt; I was actually hoping we could still be friends once our FWB arrangement comes to an end.

I don't know why this is so difficult for you to parse, but you're not in a friends-with-benefits relationship, you're in a benefits-for-benefits relationship."
299,Yeah but if they get married she'd love it. Creepy depends on who it comes from.
300,"Your boyfriend has a boyfriend. If that's not something that's okay with you, break up."
301,"It sounds like you guys got married when you weren't ready to be, I'm afraid."
302,"No, he should not do this. He should use his words, and be clear that he has feelings for her and wants to go on a date with her. He should not try to kiss her when she has given him zero reason to think she's interested in that."
303,"Alright.  If you are approaching this irrationally then seeking advice on this sub is not going to be what you're looking for.  By all means, you are welcome to do (or think) whatever you like."
304,"I used to have this. When I was younger, I was so concerned over smelling that would shower 3x a day, brush my teeth 10x a day, wash my feet every time I took off my shoes....honestly, I wish someone had told me to get help; my friends just acted slightly bemused and confused. Now I have skin and hair issues due to disrupting natural oil production, permanently receded gums, worn down enamel...

I got help to understand where it was coming from and to develop coping mechanisms for the ""must be clean! I stink!"" thoughts. It was hard to acknowledge it was even ""abnormal"", as you say, since ""wanting to be clean isn't a bad habit, right???"" It's a struggle still, years later. 

All this to say, yes, it's so important to encourage her to talk to a professional about this specific issue. You can pm me if you like."
305,"Yeah me and my roommates usually always lock the doors, the time he showed up to the party my roommates just let him in because they are very non confrontational people and didn't see an issue with it, nor did they want to make a scene to tell him he wasn't welcome. I appreciate you're concern, I will definitely be more careful with the locks though and make sure my roommates are too"
306,"She booked a vacation all on her own, without your input? And didn't even apologize for standing you up on a lunch date? Yeah, these are problems. That vacation thing is *very* concerning, not only the decision made unilaterally but skipping time with you, and excluding you from the family trip. Really concerning.

When you approach her with a problem, do you focus on yourself and your feelings, needs, and wants using I statements? How do you bring it up?"
307,"She's dumb, honey. Dumb and ignorant. Don't feel bad for wanting to surround yourself with some intellectual stimulation. "
308,"I don't even know if she lost her cool. It's worded lile that because he thinks it's crazy, but she didn't yell at him or anything. He asked her if she was serious and she said yes and explained her reasoning."
309,It sounds like Nice Guy behavior
310,"See I think that people misunderstand me in this regard.

I trust her.

I just don't feel comfortable with her chatting with an old fling. Its a respect thing.  I feel grossed out and disrespected.

Also, there are plenny of people in this world, be friends with someone you haven't crossed that line with.

JUST MY OPINION  
i know i am not the only one.

"
311,Nothing you can really do. One partner isn't okay with you being with this guy. Can't force him to think other wise. (Not saying you are) It seems like pretty soon you'll have to make a choice though. I don't see him coming around and being okay with your situation. 
312,"i'm a single guy and I've never jacked off to facebook pictures....never once.  I find that really fucking weird that people do that, and OP, your BF isn't the only one

You know that you have issues and you're trying to get help for that, which is great.  It just sounds like, perhaps, you shouldn't be dating right now.  Having some ""single time"" to work on yourself might be in your best interest

I have no idea what you should do about your BF, but tell him that reddit (yes I speak for reddit right now) thinks he should just stick to porn for masturbation in the future"
313,Thank you.
314,"&gt;It did come up as part of a relevant conversation we were having 

You keep saying this again and again as if it excuses her behavior. It does not. She could have said ""Oh,"" or ""I understand,"" or ""Oh, I have heard some people are like that,"" or 1,000 other things. 

Instead, she CHOSE to create drama by saying ""Yes, someone warned me about you - but nah-nah, I'm not telling who!"" 

Example. Let's say we have a friend Biff who tells me that you were once in jail for stealing a car. One day, you come to me and we talk and you say ""Man, this reminds me of...well, let's just say there's something in my past I'm not proud of."" I'd say ""Oh really?"" and you say ""Yeah...see, once, when I was younger, I stole a car. I actually served time for it. It really sucked, and I have put that all behind me."" My reply is ""Oh, wow. That really sucks man, glad to hear you've moved on and you're doing well now."" 

Not once did I say ""Yeah, I know, someone told me,"" or ""Oooh yeah,  you're the car thief guy!"" or ""Yeah, everyone's talking about it,"" or anything like that. I keep that to MYSELF. Because I am not a drama llama, and there is ZERO need to stir the pot. 
 
Your friend is a jerk because you caught her participating in gossip, and now she doesn't want to rat out the gossiper, because she already fucked up by 1.  admitting she participated in the gossip, and 2.  betrayed the confidence of whomever told HER. 

She is NOT a trustworthy person, and don't confide in her."
315,"I have nothing to contribute but ""copper mining"" is my new favorite phrase"
316,For both of them.  It wouldn't be good for him to be in a relationship with a woman who doesn't love him.  How is it not the best thing for both of them?
317,"I just feel there has to be a better explanation then jumping straight to ""she's cheating."" Seems like an extreme reaction. "
318,Call the police to help you recover your stolen property.
319,"She is good at messing with your head. How are you going to ask if you feel that you are blowing her emotional affair and gas-lighting behavior out of proportion? 

Do you not see that she is trying to have a relationship with two people? "
320,"&gt; I'd tell your wife that you can't sit on this any longer and that she needs to tell her best friend that you saw them in public, that you know what's up and that you are telling her husband.

The problem with this is that the cheater can then concoct a story to discredit the OP and make it look like he is lying about her for some reason.  That's why you never let the cheater know that you are about to reveal their secret."
321,"You are 2.5 months into your relationship.....basically this is as good as it gets. This is the honeymoon, ga-ga, falling off of the turnip truck, googly eyes, warm mushy good feelings and everything is wonderful phase.

Yet you are being nit picked while you text your best friend ex. 

Think about that. "
322,"It can be very discouraging though. While it takes two to have a relationship, after two years with no trace can seem a little bit sketchy. Some people are cool with it, for instance if the person isn't very active in posting but maybe just uses it to stay up to date.

It's a good feeling to know the person your with shows pride in you as a SO, and if they never ever do that-- not even once-- eventually one person may be left feeling why there is no trace. Of course social media shouldn't represent the relationship as a whole... but some people may do this specifically so their options with other people stay open. OP has a right to be frustrated. Asking for a relationship change after two years is not asking for much. His excuse of ""not feeling like it"" isn't even a strong one at that. 

Relationships are about compromise, if he is refusing to change his relationship status under the impression that he is too lazy when it's only a few clicks to make someone feel more appreciated, why wouldn't he do it?

It's a small thing to ask for, not sure why he's having issues doing it."
323,"I think it's actually much kinder to do what you did than to just let something ""fizzle out"" (i.e., ghost on someone).  You've done your part, now I would just be done with him - ignore his texts or calls, ignore any mean comments he may make, block him on social media - and just move on with your life!  You handled this well, and he's just not accepting it for whatever reason.  Getting him to accept it is not your responsibility. "
324,My grandma would rise from her grave of 14 years and kick the ever living shit out of me if I ever said that.
325,Weird. Well I hope you find one that's more accommodating 
326,"This. OP you could have literally died. The **number one** cause of accidental death in the home is falling. 6,000 people die every year because they accidentally slip and fall in their house. Your soon-to-be sister-in-law intentionally and consciously created a scenario in which the thing that kills the most people in homes every year happened to you. And she filmed it. While you were naked. 

This girl filmed you naked without your consent and, for all intents and purposes, attempted to kill you (though unintentionally). And the family and your fiancé is taking *her* side. "
327,"Honestly who cares, he's just using you anyway. "
328,"I would make another complaint to the company and ask for an exact record of these additional fees and why they were not outlined initially.  I would send to everyone you've dealt with as well as the CEO.  I would also publish reviews EVERYWHERE.  And if it were me, I'd screen shot and tweet it at them. :)

As for your SIL, be civil but ignore her.  ""Hello greedy brat. I hope you're doing well.""  Tell your husband that you refuse to do more and you will no longer be an active part of her life."

330,"Crushes happen, they will happen for the rest of your life.  You let this one go too far, and you learned a lesson from it. 

Emotional energy is not infinite.  You found yourself taking from one to feed the other.  Now that you have experience you will see it coming a mile away a know to put the breaks on it in the future.  

What to do for now?  It sounds like you are at a tipping point.  You can **choose** to start pumping that emotional energy back into your BF, fake it until you make it.  Or you can choose to run with the feelings you have fed.  "
331,"Ask her. 

Myself, I used to only really get enthusiastic about sex when I had some liquor in me. Husband knows this, and I invited him to take advantage, because it was fun for me as well, both when sober and inebriated. But certainly with a different person, in a different situation, that could go a lot differently. "
332,"My ex's hands sweat a lot and we would walk holding hands, she would either let go of my hand and wipe the sweat on her pants and then take my hand again or we'd switch hands, as in she'd move to the other side of me to hold my other hand. It's not a big deal and she was more conscious about it than I was, I only noticed when she brought it to my attention. "
333,"Um...you should make your own post because this is fascinating and very sad, and I'm very curious whether this is something you've just accepted to be inevitable or whether it's something you're working on. "
334,"So because of you hurting her and being pigheaded about a completely callous request, you now feel too ""ashamed"" to talk to her. Get over yourself and think of how she's feeling like you are pretending to do here on the internet, swallow your pride and actually act in the way you know she would want you to. Ask her. Don't be that guy that pretends everything is so hard on them because they messed up, it's just dramatic, annoying and takes all the attention that should be proving how you are sorry and reassuring your wife you love/trust her and instead redirecting it to a pity party about how hard your life is."

It should say something like:

2. My photographs are being infringed

When they tell you they will disown you: ""It's too bad you are making that choice but okay, I won't contact you again. If you change your mind and are willing to accept us as we are I will welcome you back into our lives.""

When they try to start an argument don't engage. Don't JADE--Justify, Argue, Defend or Explain. Just hang up, don't respond to texts or leave.

Hard-core religious of any faith do have conditional love because leaving the religion is a direct threat to their world view. Any dissent or another point of view will be shut down immediately. They want to control you, not listen to you. You are an adult. You have the right to make your own choices regardless of what they think. If blackmail works this time, they will never stop using it.

343,"Out of curiosity did you ask your girlfriend if she would happy if you had sex with other girls to see if the sex with her is better?

An important part of sex in a relationship is the emotional fulfillment and she won't get that from a one night stand. All she will get is a short term boost to her ego and then some regret at the vacuous nature of the encounter.

She needs to find other ways to raise her self-esteem otherwise your relationship is not going to improve."

I'm assuming no, because you understand that people age and nobody looks the same forever.

348,"She needs to be aware that people are getting shot at for this kind of reckless behavior these days. That she ""can't help it"" is a pile of BS. She can obviously control her rage at other times that can be frustrating, like waiting in line or dealing with other day-to-day drudgery. Her ""never been in an accident"" is pure arrogance and means nothing. Working in auto insurance, I have seen ideal customers who have gone 25+ years without so much a single tow bill suddenly total 2 cars within a month."
349,"&gt;she's never been in an accident, etc, etc.

The problem with this logic paired with her behavior is that if she ever does get into an accident, it's going to kill her or whoever she hits.

I would almost be tempted to separate these issues out into two to better handle them.

- Road rage(flipping people off, tailgating, etc)

- Unsafe driving habits(texting, social media, speeding, swerving through traffic)

Either one of those is bad, but both is a recipe for disaster.  Are you ready to care for a severely wounded girlfriend when she eventually wrecks herself?

Are you prepared to pay the court fines, and potentially be her chauffeur when her license is eventually taken away?

Driving the way she drives WILL get her caught sooner, rather than later.  It's not like she's going 10 over the limit and sticking with traffic.  She's making herself into a neon sign that any traffic cop will want to catch if they can.  She's the kind of idiot they look for.

So, maybe start with talking to her about the unsafe habits before the road rage.  If she won't budge, then you refuse to get into a car with her as the driver.  If she gets angry at it, like she usually does, find some statistics about car accidents or list out stuff I said or others have said about how you aren't willing to bail her out when she gets thousands in fines and loses her license or kills someone or herself. "
350,I would not take the situation seriously myself if my boyfriend was freaking out that I got pregnant because he got precum on his hand before fingering me. You all need to learn more about reproduction.

353,"I see. To me, this is reaching intervention levels of emotional abuse. I think I would have a proactive sit-down with Emily and the rest of your friends that are on the same page. Tell her that you have watched her deteriorate because of him, and that you find it really unhealthy. That you all feel it would be best for her to cut him out, that she'll have 100% support from you all. That you all will likewise cut him out too. The choice is ultimately up to her, but if she chooses to stay with him, that it will have a real impact on your friendships. You might be happy to see her without Tom, but that you will not be endorsing the relationship any longer, and not invite him to join your group outings. 

&gt;she ""turned his friends against him.""

Tell her that he did this all by himself. "
354,"I can second this, I have this personality defect. I literally don't know how to react when someone has bad news and my brain basically spazzes out.

Just decide if you are ready for that for the rest of your life."
355,"I don't really understand why it's selfish to not want to be openly disrespected. You even agreed that his behaviour is uncalled for, why is it so unreasonable for her to expect her boyfriend to say something to his own friend about it?"
356,You've moved on. He needs to as well. 
357,Go for it. You'll regret it later if you don't and what's the worst that could happen? You suffer ~2 months of teasing (it's almost April and they're seniors) for a relationship that could turn out to be awesome.

Is leaving your partner sick and with a bad back in a blizzard really okay to you? You are definitely in the wrong here."

If somehow I had money there's no way I would want my husband to keep working his 50 hour a week job while I sat at home and read books (sounds lovely though!).

363,"Building off of this, you are contributing less financially to your relationship with Hannah than you contributed financially to your relationship with Lucy.  

There are more areas to contribute to a relationship than finances.  Are you doing more for Hannah than you did for Lucy in other areas?  (Do you have a shared hobby that you do together, such as swing dancing or cooking classes? Do you make more of an effort to spend quality time with her than you did for Lucy?  Do you give Hannah more affirmation?  Do you give her foot rubs or massages? idk. Hopefully you get the point) If not, then it might make sense for Hannah to perceive less value/effort. 

I would suggest talking about things that you do for Hannah and why expectations might be different, but why you value Hannah and how you show it.  Then, if the only thing Hannah cares about is financial contributions, there might be a problem."
364,"&gt; question his intentions

He knows you have a boyfriend and is actively pursuing you. Beyond the age gap (yep) his intentions aren't simply to be your friend, he wants more."

367,Good grief. There is no such thing as a freaking soul mate. You sound like a character in your own overwrought paperback romance novel. Leave them both alone and do some work on becoming a more authentic person. 
368,But she KNOWS that she did something that you wouldn't want her to do. Her reaction when you pulled up proves that. You don't need to explain anything. She knows what she did.
369,"First of all, she's not honest. She's been lying to you all this time even before you guys were married. She only said ""I can't lie to you"" when you have heard and caught her in the lie. Been there before with a boyfriend still in love with ex and it's just going back and forth between wanting the security and also the romance. You cannot have the cake and eat it too. Leave and don't drag this on, or else it will get very draining and painful. "
370,OP this is the right answer. You have your own depression to take care of and have resources available to help you with this person who has latched on to you. It sounds like (true to her former classmate's reports) she has become obsessed with you. 
371,"I mean, if he's so concerned that the keys don't match and he's demanding you fix it...you could just switch the other door locks to the same as the front door. 

But in all seriousness, while you should have told him before you just switched them while he was out, you're not being unreasonable in asking him to lock the door. I grew up in the country too and while, yes, we left the door unlocked if we were home and yeah we left the door unlocked if we went out for a walk, we *always* locked the door if we were going to work, and *always* at night. 

Even if your neighbourhood wasn't in a city, and didn't have safety concerns, I don't think you're being unreasonable, and it sounds like your solution was the best one for both of you.

I think you need to apologise for the unilateral decision - but *only* for the unilateral decision. The lock you have is a pretty good compromise - he doesn't have to worry about carrying keys, or his hands being full or just forgetting, and you have your peace of mind. Hopefully, he's just upset that you did it without asking and if you apologise for the surprise of him coming home to find he can't get into his own house he'll cool down. "
372,"Have you compared notes with your sister? Maybe her fiance has info about what happened.

I think when you confront him, don't let on what you know and how, because you're more likely to get the truth. If he knows what you already know, he will probably only admit to that and no more.  I'd probably just start by telling him that you know he wasn't honest and he has one chance to come clean and give the full truth. If he still lies then you need to decide what to do about it. I personally would not want to be in a relationship with someone as fundamentally dishonest as your boyfriend.

If he does come clean then give him a second chance, but also tell him he needs to take any job he can. His credit card debt should not negatively impact you in any way, and it's probably about time he stopped being a mooch."
373,"You're worried about causing trouble in someone else's relationship? If anything happens because you're curious and truthful, it's on her man, not you. Just like you'd love to know what's behind the shady shit he pulled....Maybe she's in the same friggin boat. Who knows. But revealing someone else's poor choices and actions doesn't make you the bad guy. "
374,"That is quite awhile for irritation and such but I still don't think it is any cause for alarm. Like the others said, stressing over it isn't helping. I know it's hard to ""remain calm"" trust me I have had issues down there (and do right now actually) but thinking about it all the time def doesn't help. Get the test in three months but until then quit looking up what it might be. That's a doctor's job and I am 100% certain they will be more successful at finding whatever it is. 

I know it's hard to do, but you can do it :)  "
375,"There's a difference between ""Why do Chinese people spit so much"" and ""Why are Chinese people so fxxcking dirty."" Big difference.

The latter comes across as prejudiced. It's an insulting generalization about the hygiene of an entire country's people. I think it's pretty clear why that comment is offensive and not just somebody ""calling it like you see it."" 

Also, any time you take one person's behavior and use it to make a negative generalization about everyone of that person's race, it is racist. There is no one behavior or trait that every single person of a given race embodies. If you say ""That guy is dirty,"" you are calling it like you see it. If you say ""Chinese people as a whole are dirty,"" you are making a racist statement. "
376,"I would bet $1000 she does not tell her boss to fuck off or kill himself when she has a problem at work. This means that she can control her temper, she just does not feel obligated to control it in your direction.  This person is an abuser, you can't fix this. Please take care of yourself and leave this relationship. "
377,"Yes, something has changed and she's not communicating something to you. Personally, I'd be calling her out especially her being on all these social media things but can't take the time to talk to you? No way! Don't put up with that. You need to ask her for a talk and see where her head and heart is and don't let her string you along. "
378,This is what is called an extinction burst. It doesn't​ just take one time of hanging up in the middle of the conversation. It will probably take way more times than that and your mother will escalate because so far it has worked. Stop giving into her escalations. She will eventually learn that the topic is not up for discussion if you keep your foot down.
379,"&gt;Let me go to the millions of immigrants in NYC and ask them, ""why HAVEN'T you learned English!?"" See how fucked up that sounds?

Er, no, that sounds quite reasonable actually, if you live in NYC you need English. What's your point? You seem confused"

381,"I don't think you understand the guy's point - the fact that your emotions are getting so heated you can't talk face to face is a bad sign. It's good that you recognize this and take to email, but being able to have a mature conversation about *any* topic face to face still beats that."
382,"Yeah, this would make it super painful. Too anxious for sex with him, down for a threesome with friends."
383,"The way he cheated on you, under circumstances when he was likely to be caught, suggests that this wasn't the first time. This is very weird: 

&gt; He's told me in the past when he's been at a bar at night while away for work and a girl has flirted with him. He would tell me and also mention how that girl could never compare to me.

I mean, why would he bring that up? You interpreted it as honesty and loyalty, but another way to read it is that he has a guilty conscience and is covering his tracks by feigning honesty and loyalty. I think you need to be open to the possibility that this is not a one-time incident. Someone who goes home with a stranger while friends are bound to notice he's missing . . . that seems like someone who's pretty comfortable cheating, not someone who is doing it for the first time. 

Others have pointed out that you chose to confide in friends and family for support, and now you're complaining that they aren't telling you what you want to hear. It's possible that they've noticed other red flags in his behavior that you've tuned out or explained away to yourself. "
384,"Yeah... you two are totally in the wrong here. Putting on ""his cartoons"" and leaving him is not watching him and your dad has every right to ground you two since you didn't take the safety of a 6 year old seriously. Of course the 6 year old was going to follow you two into the gym. Learn from this and next time you're asked to baby-sit your brother, actually do so. 

And ba-humbug. Your step-brother's biological siblings actually cared for his well-being. You're not going to get any sympathy on this sub for leaving a 6 year old kid alone and now dealing with the consequences. Better this than anything worse actually happening. "
385,"Oh, stop it.

You know very little, pretty much nothing of their relationship and you're making incredibly broad statements.

My husband and I are polar opposite. But that doesn't mean we're going to fail. I need his personality in my life and he needs mine.

Sometimes it's works, sometimes it doesn't. But in either case what makes or breaks it isn't just one thing,it's a cumulative of things."
386,"You didn't call her fat. You expressed how pleased you were to cuddle her, and how good she felt to you. Unfortunately her anxiety about her weight twisted your words so that she took it as a verbal attack. 

Neither of you are bad people, you clearly didn't mean it maliciously, and I am going to assume she is just in a bad place and likewise didn't mean to act maliciously against you. 

That said, this isn't something you can fix on your own, and it's going to be a very long haul for her to get that nasty twisted inner dialogue she's got fixed. 

I think couple's therapy to learn how to communicate together and individual therapy for herself. Her self esteem is shot. You deserve to be able to talk with your wife without fear of how she'll react, and she deserves to be able to come from a place of trust in you and in herself. "
387,"If you have a magnet board or other notice board you could get two magnets for food and however many magnets for water and then get everyone to move the magnets to their designated area when the dog is fed so everyone can see whether or not she's been fed. 
You can just say you have anxiety about the dog being fed and it would ease your mind. You don't have to blame anyone you can just say it's a weird worry you have like forgetting to turn off the stove. Also you would find out pretty quick if it's just a suspicion that they forget a lot or if they are doing it but you don't realise.
Same with walks.
A few walks a day and exercise a couple times a week sounds OK to me but I'm not an expert. 
The stitches thing is unfortunate but mistakes happen. Surely it's an expensive mistake if they have to take her back to the vet."
388,"So, it sounds like all the emotional labor in your relationship is left up to your wife?

Google ""emotional labor.""  It is *exhausting.*  If he is doing all the heavy lifting here...yeah, she's right to be pissed."
389,"Wow that is so embarrassing, you have the right to bummed out but not worth your relationship. We're you guys drinking, maybe impaired judgment"
390,If I tried pulling this crap on my wife she would smack me.
391,"This is not relatively normal. It is cruel and a narcissistic viewpoint - are you sure he hasn't shown these tendencies throughout the marriage? It would seem that you both placed a high value on your looks but he lacks the maturity and decency to withhold comments that serve only to hurt you. I would say that the fairytale you envisaged your marriage to be was a falsehood if he can be so utterly cruel to someone who has loved him for 30 years. What to do? Make sure you articulate that an affair is out of the question and then head to counselling - individually at first - to unpack what is reality in your relationship and what is not, then make decisions accordingly. "
392,Are you a barber? Do you have a history of cutting people's hair? If the answer is no she had no right to ask you to do so and even expect for a second it will come out right. And even if you were qualified to cut hair she had no right to assault you over it. Get away from her. 
393,"In the future don't talk to the secretary about benefits. Talk to HR or accounting.

Also, asking if you could ""stop being charged"" is different from asking if you could stop being *covered*. The way you worded it, she probably thought you just didn't want to pay and somehow wanted to get out of having to pay the premium. When in fact, what you meant was that you already have insurance and wanted to unenroll.

Knowledge is empowerment. Go ask for paperwork about your benefits and payroll deductions. Educate yourself proactively going forward and you will feel better. Take this opportunity to act on anything else you're unsure about and have been sitting on."
394,"Wow, he doesn't even need to gaslight you because you're gaslighting yourself. How would *him* abusing *you* ever be your fault? Normal people aren't like ""oh well once my SO crosses this line then it's ok for me to beat them"""
395,"Christ this reminds me of the time I overheard a teenager saying that he only likes old music like Panic at the Disco, and I realized I was officially ancient. Also when I was a teenager, all my friends made fun of me for being into something as mainstream and lame as Panic at the Disco, so your brother seriously has no idea what he's talking about. I think I went through a phase where I listened to The Misfits though and thought I was so cool and edgy for that and no one else knew who The Misfits was, so hey maybe your brother will grow out of it too.

Anyway, your brother sounds like he's at that stage in life where he thinks his taste in music or whatever is the same thing as having an interesting and unique personality. I'd just roll my eyes a little and be like ""yeah sure whatever"" or ""dude no one cares"" if he starts talking about it."
396,Your roommates are fucking misers.
397,"&gt; I want to wait for her because I do not know if she really is done with me, or if it's her pushing me away because of her problems 

Here's a life lesson, OP. Her reasons for rejecting you are completely irrelevant. It does not matter if she's not interested or if she's rejecting you to work on herself. Either way, you have to assume she is permanently done. You don't get to decide for her whether or not she means it. 

If you want to help her, respect her decision and move on. Do not stress her out by constantly hovering around waiting for her to change her mind. That is selfish behavior, no matter how you dress it up as being ""for her own good."" "
398,"&gt; I think he feels betrayed that I let us get so deep into it before pulling the plug.

This just speaks volumes about his maturity.

You let us get so deep?  More like, you constantly tried to manage his unrealistic expectations, but because he had no interest in helping at all, his expectations remained high and eventually slammed into reality's brick wall.

Your husband needs to grow up.  He needs to take equal responsibility for his own role in this."
399,"But it's not working, or you wouldn't have made this post about it. "
400,"&gt; I know that's dumb 

It's beyond dumb. Come on dude, it's 2017. You're giving all teenagers a bad rep right now. "
401,"Your boyfriend was almost 30 when he started to date you.  Why wasn't that 'sad' ?

If you were dating someone your own age,  I bet he'd have a lot of fun making costumes with you and going to the con.

Sure,  there are women who make porn in their cosplay.  Most of the ones I know who do that are married or in long term relationships.  Who cares if they sleep around though - why would it affect you or your old man? 

Have you ever heard of projection? Your boyfriend thinks women who make costumes are trash. Why is that okay to you? 

I've been cosplaying since 1998, and not once has anything like he's described transpired in my presence. Does it happen?  Sure,  but rarely without consent.  Conventions are the only place I've seen people actively preventing others from taking pictures without permission or saying something about sexual harassment.  Why do you think people feel safe to dress in some of the more provocative designs? It's honestly very liberating to dress up and talk to bunch of nerd friends. 

By the way,  I'll thank you to not imply that cosplayers get intoxicated and hump on everything without permission.  I've never been drunk or high in cosplay,  nor did I cheat on anyone.  Even if other people do those things,  shouldn't you wonder why your boyfriend finds you so weak willed as to be susceptible to the first person that asks you to do something like that?  

Then again,  we are talking about the single 30 year old guy who asked out a 16 year old. He doesn't want you bring independent.  Now run along and be a good wifey, and make sure to stick to his timeline of popping out his spawn by 21!

"
402,Making sure you aren't using someone to get over your ex is before you fully commit is hardly selfish.
403,I would tend to agree with you about being shitty. Two wrongs don't make a right-- just because your mom treats you like crap doesn't make it okay for you to live off of her with no intention of allowing her to do the same. If you have a problem with her just stay away. Don't try to justify your bad behavior with hers. Sounds like the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. She's a jerk and you're a user.
404,"It sounds like you were angry. You felt she was putting you in a bad light, and you wanted to regain control of the conversation by hurting her and casting her as a bad partner. Then you were angry that she hadn't forgiven you. If she accepted your apology after twenty minutes, you could have felt good about yourself again, but she was still upset, so you had to keep feeling bad for what you did. You felt powerless. So you decided to hurt her again to feel powerful.

Just my two cents. Something to explore in counseling."
405,"And...maybe his parents would be able to save more for retirement if they were not supporting their grown son, his wife, and their grandkid. "
406,"Thanks very much! We're not together anymore, largely because we were young and our lives took us in different directions so we naturally settled into a friendship more than anything else. However, we worked it through so successfully that there is no resentment on either side and we have been best friends for over 10 years since! We are both in ""forever relationships"" and our current partners are great friends too, so I consider it a success story even though we're not together in a romantic sense!

There was a lot more to the dynamic at the time though. I feel that for a while I almost became abusive myself as I attempted to work through the huge amount of anger I was feeling.  I don't want to sound like an apologist for abusers in any way (and I am a huge advocate for awareness of domestic violence), but my eyes were opened by the strength of the hatred and aggressive desires I could feel towards someone I ostensibly loved.  Although I never acted on the feelings physically I certainly said and did things during that angry period that were cruel and intended to cause pain, and which I was not proud of. I found it very hard to not only process my experiences of being a victim of abuse and the anger resulting from that so long after the events, but also the (as I perceived them) unacceptable feelings of vengeance and retribution that I was also feeling.  I felt that the narrative around abuse is very black and white and that I couldn't be the ""Victim"" and the one in the right if I also felt aggressive urges, even though my behaviour was a consequence of what had happened to me. To move through this period in a healthy way meant that I had to let myself feel and accept everything, and my partner had to be able to tolerate it in a way that didn't minimise their previous behaviour but that also set boundaries on what was acceptable behaviour from me- a very tough call as you can imagine! Letting me become the abuser in the relationship as a way of atoning or evening the score would not have been healthy for either of us. "

408,"If she is not unhappy with her life or style, I think trying to get her to 'spice it up' would be out of line and entirely self-serving. If you've found you just aren't compatible, which seems to be the case, I think it would be kinder to tell her you don't think you're enough alike and, despite being together for quite a while, you have trouble picturing your lives together. 

It is perfectly acceptable for a girl's closest 'friends' to be members of her family. Based on this brief write-up, she seems like a pretty normal person, just a different type of person than you are and that you want in a partner. So I suggest you refrain from judging her and feeling embarrassed on her behalf. 

EDIT: I agree with others about this being a 'grass is greener' thing. Think long and hard about how truly important it is to you that she dress in bright colors and be less of a homebody. Though you could easily find a bright and bubbly girl, she would likely have (perhaps many) other flaws and shortcomings. "
409,"I think its a bit harsh saying her husband has a ""new"" family now. As in, out with the old, in with the new. These aren't shoes we are talking about, it is a human being. Who has no one but his father, and this sub gets down on parents who don't step up and be a parent when they are needed. 

I totally agree that OP has the right to demand conditions. I think she should, but i also think it kind of sucks the position she is putting her husband in.

"
410,Pretty fucked up. Even if it is just a phase do you want to date some dumbass who thought he was black for some portion of his life at all? I would call it a lost cause and move on.
411,"I feel this thread is getting a little derailed over whether he loved OP or not.

Because to me, it makes it much worse of what he's saying is true.
If he's saying ""I love you, so I chose to hurt you. I love you, so I made you doubt your instincts do you wouldn't leave me. I love you, so I lied to you. I love you, and I treated you like this anyway."""
412,Seriously why do people think raging on a road in a metal killing machine is somehow not as bad as if you did it in a public place to strangers? If someone pissed you off in a grocery store would you walk behind them swearing and flashing a light in their eyes? I doubt it.

414,"Doesn't a intervention involve the person needing it? They might pretend that they were doing OP a favor (except for the whole ""publishing images of his home"" in the process) but interventions do not involve never getting permission to sloppily rearrange shit they were never asked to touch."
415,"When my coworker told him it wasn't cool, he said ""Oh come on, I'm just kidding!""

I guess part of this is that I also feel indebted to him because I wouldn't have this job had he not recruited me for it, but I know I can't just ignore this for that reason."
416,"Hah from personal experience I let the girl that broke up with me go to a concert we had planned to goto together and it was fucking awkward as hell.  Tell her it would be awkward and no she can drive alone you dont owe her shit.

Gee Im not bitter now 20 years later over my stupid decision am I? /s"
417,"Yea that really caught me off guard. OP, your dad does not deserve that. He may have his issues but at least in terms of financial support, he seems to be a very stand-up father. Please please don't take that for granted."
418,"Heck, I would just go up to Bob and ask if he and Alice were dating. No accusations, no drama, just innocent confusion. If he goes onto say oh no I'm not not just act confused and say ""everyone in the department thinks you are. Someone probably has placed bets on it. Was going to ask Brittany if she needed a wingman for a girl's night out since you seemed to be dating someone else.""

I feel like accusations never get me anywhere but getting people totally freaked out does. I can do the innocent face really well so placing the harsh truths in front of people is just easier. 

You can do the same with Brittany. No accusations but just use the opportunity to commiserate with her how you can never hang out with Bob solo anymore because he's always with Alice. ""He goes to the gym with her so why does he need to spend even more time with her."" Either she'll get the message or she won't but you've done your part. "
419,"FWIW, being a minister grants no particular wisdom, but what it *does* often grant is opportunities for experience with a broad spectrum of relationship issues; through working with couples on their relationships over the years, I've gotten to see (over and over) many scenarios that (thankfully) my wife and I have not had to deal with in our own relationship.

OP's situation is, unfortunately, not all that uncommon."
420,"It kind of seems to me like you're asking for what I call ""surface changes""- but whenever you think you want something or are lacking something- look a bit deeper to see what the common denominator is.  I feel like in your situation, (and I could be wrong), your main problem is that you're insecure and feel a bit undesired.  I would express these feelings to him so that he can solve it in the way he feels is best.  That way you're not really nagging him to do something small, and he gets to feel like he's still being himself (plus the added bonus of him making the call on how he wants to fix things)."
421,Do you actually talk when you're home? Do you actually have conversations? Or is it always small talk?
422,"You wouldn't have posted here if this was a good situation. He may have decent qualities. Many abusers do...they can be well employed, they can be handsome, they can have good relationships with their friends.

AND: They can still treat their relationship partner very poorly. He is treating you poorly. That is that. "
423,OP says that she gets that it might not work out and she may never have a relationship with her sister and that's okay with her. Sounds like she's saying she's not against meeting her sister when she's old enough to ask after OP but she's not intent on having a relationship. 
424,"call the baby's doctor.  The doctor may need to have a chat with your husband to explain the appropriate noise environment for a baby.


It's not fair for him to make all the noise and then expect you to soothe the baby. 


If this is deliberate, then it sounds like your husband is resentful of the baby.  Which would be ridiculous, but you never know. 


If a meeting with the doctor doesn't work, then can you move you and the baby in with your parents?  This has to be extremely stressful to the baby and his development."
425,"&gt;  it was easier to deal with two kids who missed their dad if they thought he would hurt them.

This is chilling to hear.

I'm very sorry for what she did to you."
426,"Yeah, that's what I was gonna ask. My dad used to come home from work late when I was a baby, and would often pick me up out of my crib and hang out with me. Sometimes I woke up, but he took care of me. He didn't just barge in and wake me up, then tell my mom to deal with it. In the middle of the night? She would have ripped him a new one. 

(It totally screwed up my sleep schedule, though. My mom still complains about it, haha)"
427,"I like how you framed this and totally would agree. But I think OPs wife is taking it a little too far. It sounds like her entire personality is changing for the worse (like how she can't take any light hearted jokes in her expense, and she won't show him praise even though he's asked and has supported her throughout her counseling)."

&gt; It's really simple. Change your statement to one of active intentionality. Instead of ""I have no intention of cheating on her"", try ""I intend to be faithful to her.""

This is perfect advice that really goes to the heart of the situation.  We have wedding vows in which we actively, intentionally promise to *forsake all others*.  Nothing passive about that."
432,My brother went for one when he was unemployed after being a student. He's a smart cookie and studied journalism so looked into it more right afterwards. He also did the maths for the rate of pay the guy was quoting was almost bang on minimum wage and he was supposedly a 'high earner'. 
433,"Resentment is my worry if they pay this off. We mentioned this to them and they said they would resent me more if this never came up until after her and I were married. The reason they want to do this is because they do not want to resent me. 

They want to size down the wedding instead, take 35K that they would have spent on a wedding and make sure we are debt free once we start our marriage instead. "

There are almost never reruns of CURRENT shows other than those three, and absolutely never older ones. Those have been moved to boomerang. It has actually become a bit ridiculous, as I'm not even exaggerating that it is *over 90% those three shows*. People over at r/stevenuniverse did the math haha! They have 12 shows being listed as ""airing"" but only show three during the week. So I doubt it's Cartoon Network giving the brother fear, but probably adult swim, which comes on the Sam channel late at night."
436,Everyone is different. I (girl) would much rather be with a guy who was talking commitment than one who never brought it up or danced around the issue. Kind of like getting engaged... 'I'm open to getting married' do you think that counts as a proposal? Not to any woman I know.

Did I mention your friends are black? We can't have that in our sheltered, narrow little lives. Some of that blackness may rub off on us and make us all ghetto like.  You understand right?

Don't take from other pots. Is this because you aren't bringing in money, so you feel like you  can't spend anything and have to make your own clothes? From the picture you've painted of your husband's job, your fears seem dramatic. Did you grow up very poor, by change? Have you talked to your financial advisor about your fears and worked though senarios so you know how much of a safety net you actually need? Maybe that could help you relax a bit. 

Edit: on the flip side, running senarios could also reveal that you need a bigger emergency fund, which would help your case."

455,"It sounds like you're making progress, which is great. It also sounds like your wife is making some positive changes, which is great. Overall I would consider if you might be being a bit defensive - your post and comments make it sound like you go to great lengths in general to give an explanation for why what you did is ""reasonable"" when really it would be more productive to your relationship to not nitpick tiny interactions or let tiny things stew that much. The degree of detail in your justifying and your play by plays of arguments and conflicts suggests to me that it's your anxiety at work - I have friends with anxiety and a shade of it myself (ptsd has some anxiety-like symptoms and I have that), and I think if you work at positive self talk it might really help you to deescalate these issues in your head and see them in proper perspective so you can productively handle them. 

For me with my ptsd, that means that if I'm nervous about a situation, I'll ask myself if there's a reason to be nervous (something dangerous, legitimately?) or if it's just outside of my comfort zone and it's really nothing to be nervous about. For you, maybe that means you you say hmmm, this situation is bothering me - is this something that I think was done with malice/intent to harm, or is it something done out of ignorance? (If it's the former, you get out of the situation, if it's the latter, you *let it go* and divert your anxious thoughts to a productive hobby or task instead). It's exhausting to be around people that constantly assume the worst of you, so in the interest of improving your marriage, I would suggest reminding yourself that your anxiety is making you do just that - inappropriately assign malice to situations that do not warrant that judgment. 

For the record, physical abuse is in that category of ""intent to harm"" and I hope you never forget what brought you out of that time and place. For a lot of people there would be no going back if anyone in life gets physically abusive, has drugs before having sex with them, sleeps around without their knowledge, etc, so just make sure you recognize the gift your wife and sons have given you by even willing to have a relationship with you at all after those things and that you use that gratitude for a second chance to motivate you as you combat your anxiety. You and your wife sound like you're making progress and it sounds like you're invested in the relationship still so I hope more progress comes your way. Hopefully you're making similar efforts with your sons, too, since you were physically abusive to them."
456,"For real, OP has hard set deal breakers and their partner immediately gets aggressive about them.

He's mad he can't use his usual tricks, and knows it."
457,I just want to politely disagree with part of that--OP owes nothing to the BF in terms of helping him save face. He has made incomprehensible decisions and lying more to cover himself is just one more. I hope OP sees enough value in herself to stand up for her feelings and leaves him to deal with his own consequences.

462,"Oh OP, this is fucking heartbreaking.

I'm reading your post and replies and you are twisting yourself into knots trying so hard to make excuses and rationalize his behaviour.

But here's the thing.  There is no rationalizing this- it is abusive.   You are in an abusive relationship.  You aren't stupid or 'weak', but neither are most people in abusive relationships.  You can be brilliant and capable and determined and still be abused.

I'm from a blue collar town, logging, mining, oilfields etc.  I've never once felt physically intimidated by a partner.  My best friends guy comes from a really fuckin rough place, and he would never treat her like this guy does you.  

You've only been in abusive relationships so this seems normal to you, or not so bad.  You have no frame of reference for what a good relationship is.  

So take it from me.  From your best friend.  From every single person in this thread.  **THIS IS NOT OKAY.**   This is dangerous, and you need to leave.  Please, please call the national domestic violence hotline.

People are able to guess your GF is Asian because of said habits."

Then, as you described why you enjoyed him being away, it was so you could watch what you wanted to watch.  You enjoyed not being reminded of his sacrifices for you, etc.

Frankly, you sound selfish and unappreciative.  I'm sure Dave has all sorts of flaws, everyone does.  But, perhaps this marriage isn't in his best interest either."

There's not guidebook on how to go about things, sure it's a FWB situation so it doesn't necessarily have to be formal but that doesn't mean it can't be.  You can text him, you can ghost him, you can fade away, you can have a formal conversation with him.   Whatever, it's not like he seems to really treat you with respect (chuckling at you, saying it will end when HE finds someone, but not entertaining the idea of you finding someone) so do whatever the hell you feel like.  

As far as what you said about yourself socially, I wouldn't call myself a late bloomer but I think I was close to your age when I realized FWB wasn't for me either, I don't think you're late to the game?  But hey, maybe I'm just trying to make myself feel better haha, either way, you do you and be happy and don't worry about it.  Dude sounds like a total DOUCHE so just move on.  I think you took the high ground by having a conversation and frankly, he's probably just butt hurt that things didn't end on *his* terms.  "
475,"Sure, but even so - she's 21. I know a lot of people who got theoretically-worthwhile degrees because they were scared to leave school and then ended up not wanting to work in that field. It wouldn't be a bad idea for her to go into the workforce before just jumping into another degree."

Or he's simply not into sports? I really don't follow most teams' schedules, unless it's a major game for my hometown's team. I don't know, manipulation seems to be a stretch here. I imagine he either just wasn't tracking their schedule or, like you said in your second paragraph, figured they could do something before or after the game."

Maybe she's just like me and has no motivation unless there's a pressing deadline or pressure from someone she is trying to create a good impression on. "
486,"OP, that fact that you only moved a few weeks ago is WHY he has escalated now. He's waited until he knew you were in a situation where you would find it very hard to get away or find support. He is RELYING on that.

Everything up until now has been an act to get you into this position where he can control and abuse you. The man you thought you loved was a lie and a front. His physical abuse of you will get worse. I honestly worry for your safety if he realises you're going to try to leave; the statistics on this speak for themselves.

Don't let him know what you're doing. Wait for him to be asleep or leave your home. Grab your passport and any other important documents you need, anything else that is 100% necessary (this might be laptop with your work on it, or health certificates, or other form of ID, it is NOT 'those heels you can't live without') and a single change of clothes, and get to the damned airport. Call your parents when you're there. Be honest. Ask them to get you home. Sack your savings if you have to.

Anything else can be replaced or handled at a later time. RIGHT NOW your life is in danger. You cannot be replaced. 

Please please please run."
487,"This is so important.

OP, losing weight is a difficult thing that you will always struggle with.  You might decide to overhaul your life to do that, or you might not.  It's never going to be as easy to stay small at 30 as it is at 20.  If you do decide to try and lose weight, I think you need to have a talk with your partner about realistically, what that's going to look like, how long it's going to take, and how you can't guarantee that it's going to happen.  You need to talk about how it's important to you to feel loved and appreciated.  You need to talk about what would happen if you tried really hard to lose weight but it didn't happen, or if you got pregnant, or if you got old.

It's entirely possible that your partner is worrying about the speed of your weight gain.  30 lbs in 3 years, maybe he's thinking ""I'm scared for your health, what is she going to look like in 10 years if this is happening now"".  If that's the problem, and it's not so much that ""if you don't look as perfect as you did the moment I met you I'm not attracted to you.""  If that's the case, even just talking about ""I can't eat and work out now like I did when I was younger and expect to stay the same size, I'm going to make some changes for my health"" is going to make him feel better, and that combined with ""here are the things I need you to do for me so that I feel loved and appreciated"" will fix things going forward.

But if not, he needs to hear ""This is my body and what it looks like.  I'm going to try to make some changes for my own health, but those changes might not result in my looking the way you want me to.  And as I get older, my body will have more changes too.  You can choose to stick around and show me the love and respect that I expect from my partner in life, or you can get out now."""

And the OP saved money by selling them ownership of the washer. Not access, ownership. That they would want to sell it on once they moved out was inevitable. It sucks, but he made this rod for his own back.

I mean, $30 is a stupid amount to fight over, but-"
490,I figured you just *really* liked the advice ¯\\\_(ツ)\_\/¯ 
491,"That sounds less self deprecating than it does flat out defensive - I really hate to say this, but it sounds like he has no idea what to do with you and no desire to try to figure it out. The fact that you're still making an attempt to communicate has backed your father into a corner he doesn't want to be in and he's getting short tempered.

I'd stay in touch with your cousin, let her know you're interested in meeting any family who's interested in you too. Let Rob do his own thing - if he reaches out, cool, but I'd be done putting the effort in, myself."

You met in your 30's. You survived before him and you'll survive after him, only now you know better than to be treated like a side piece.

Are you in therapy? I think it would be beneficial for you to learn more about yourself and what you want from relationships. Instead of taking what you can get, you deserve to get what you want which is marriage and a live-in partner who shares their life with you."
493,"This is really logically presented, I agree with this. Her source of self-worth (tinder matching) is not appropriate for a serious relationship. She needs to develop more sustainable methods of garnering self-confidence that do not borderline cheating so closely and tackle those issues with her therapist further. "

No shit.  I'd get angry too if I was working full-time and then had to take care of a screaming, difficult child while my spouse went off and had fun and games (and lunches) with single members of the opposite sex.

Especially if it had been going on for weeks/months and my spouse kept shirking their responsibility and staying out far longer than required."
495,"I know this won't make you feel any better, but you really seem like a great partner. Sometimes just knowing that you didn't do anything wrong can help. You should never say ""what if I did this.."" because you were already a great partner, and it's nothing you did, he just was no longer feeling the spark (which isn't your fault). Go on living life and knowing that you have a lot of love to give."
496,"Thanks for clarifying but after reading your responses to other comments, I'm still going to stick with the general belief that this dude is kinda immature.

If he brought up the idea of having a non monogamous relationship, then he nixed it, then made a post about how he thinks you'll resent him for it... that just seems very immature.

You seem to never have had a problem with any of these things, he seems to be kind of all over the place as far as what he wants and doesn't seem super secure.

It's hard to judge a whole relationship based off one post, but I'm just thinking that he needs to get his own stuff sorted out, bc it sounds like he is just very confused and complicated."
497,"I mean, chlamydia CAN be asymptomatic. If you're experiencing symptoms then get yourself to the doctor ASAP and get tested.

498,"Make sure you smell good

Dress well, not too formal but not a pair of tracksuit pants and thongs either

Smell good

Make sure you listen, don't get flustered and nervous and spend all your time talking and not letting her get a word in

Compliment her, make her feel special

When you talk to her via text, say some very subtle flirty things to test the waters and gauge her response 

For the love of god don't come on too strong, that scares girls away like crazy

Take it slow, i know you're young and you're crushing, but don't try and rush things, a rushed relationship is a relationship that is doomed to fail 9 times out of 10

Keep the conversation light and fun, don't try and rush into a deep and meaningful about love and relationships or your personal problems

Really just gauge her mannerisms and stuff on the day, look for all the signs

Invite her to hang out after your first date, if she says she'll see when she's free and doesn't suggest an alternative, than she's almost certainly not interested, if that's the case, just accept it and move on.


That's all i can think of man, best of luck, we've all been there once

&gt; There have been no 'mysterious trips' or secret texts like any other number of these posts - for the most part, we do things together, and she's not weird about her privacy on her phone or computer.    

But they've been in touch.  When, where, how was this happening?

&gt;But, every few months or so, this guy will text her or snapchat her and ask what she's up to. **And it all comes flooding back. She's tried blocking him, but the feelings don't go away.**

She's **tried** blocking him?  What about **actually** blocking him?

&gt;She swears up and down that she's never acted on these feelings, and even said that a few months before she got married he reached out to her and asked if she was happy.   

I'm so sorry.  She just told him ""**I Love you**, but I'm married.""  That IS acting on her feelings!  What the hell was the other side of the conversation about?  

At a minimum, please go for couples counselling to really unpack the situation and see if you can move forward.  Perhaps your wife would benefit from individual therapy as well (if she still has issues from her parents divorce).

Have you sat her down and asked her, face to face.  ""Is there anything else you want to tell me about your relationship with this guy""? 

I'm so sorry, please schedule couples counselling, a STD check and an appointment with a lawyer asap (this last just as a fact finding exercise).

503,"I think your mother needs to have one last talk with him to set him straight (maybe she should give *him* a spanking). I doubt he will ever listen to you if he's got THIS much of a chip on his shoulder. That said, he's been nursing this grudge for almost 40 years, I don't know if he will ever let it go. 

To be honest, your brother sounds like a bit of a fuck-up. A father at age 19 (I'm going to guess the pregnancy wasn't planned), three marriages - these are not really signs of someone who has their shit together. It sounds like he resents you for forcing him to grow up (he couldn't depend on mummy to bail him out of reality and raise his daughter for him). So he's still buying (and selling) the narrative that all his problems came from you, instead of facing the fact that he screwed up his own life. 

He's not right. He's wrong. And immature. And presumably unhinged. I would cut contact with him entirely - it sounds like there would be no love lost. And if you do both have to attend your mother's funeral, hire a big bodyguard. 
"
504,[deleted]
505,Yeah he would always try to pit his daughter and me against each other growing up and try to cause us to hate each other but it actually backfired on him and made us closer. She and I are best friends to this day and she thinks he's a complete tool and doesn't have anything to do with him herself. He was an absentee dad since he divorced her mom and never gave two shits about seeing her until she was spending time at her grandma's house (my mom) and he would swoop in to cause drama. Yeah he's just mean spirited. 
506,"It sounds as though they sent you away because it was unfair to have you in a household - you were getting yelled at, you weren't getting the attention you deserve - whereas at your aunt's, you somewhere much healthier.

&gt; No body will give me a right answer. It's always the run around.

I think it's more likely that they simply don't know the answer and there's no easy way to tell you that. Apart from the fallout of what to do with your brother and step-sister (one or both of them could potentially be kicked out/cut off), there's a pregnancy (both abortions and births/raising the child are difficult to handle) and there's no tellng when things will be better for you to return.

I know it sucks but I would concentrate on trying to make the best of the situation. It would be worth seeing if your school has a counsellor you can talk to or a teacher you trust - so you have an adult who can listen and offer advice since your aunt and your mother don't sound like they're in the spot to do that."

509,"You are being a bit culturally insensitive with this comment.  Different cultures can have different values than you, and you don't need to "" excuse them"" by saying not everyone does that. In fact that is you imposing your value of ""hygiene"" on another culture.

Those that do not do this are more westernized, but that it not necessarily superior as you seem to think."

511,"You know, this attitude is kind of bullshit. I don't tolerate abuse from anyone but this is kind of an extenuating circumstance. 

For one, crimes of passion are a thing. Grown men have walked in on these kinds of situations and have completely lost it. You can hardly expect a fourteen year old boy to have the same level of control as a grown man. And it's not as hard to fracture a cheekbone as you seem to think it is. One punch, at the wrong angle, could do it. He wouldn't necessarily had to have gone into a blind rage. 

Secondly, op's mom is already trying to make excuses for herself. (Marrying young was dumb, I mistook contentment for boredom, it was a mistake, blah blah blah.) No narrator is ever completely reliable and that goes double for someone who has an incentive to remember things differently. 

Thirdly, what op's mom did was very, very traumatizing for that kid. Fourteen is a sensitive age. He was just beginning to explore relationships. Seeing his mother having sex with someone other than his father probably had a very negative impact on all his relationships. He, as a child, punched his mother in the face. The mother, as an adult, gave her son psychological trauma that he will have to deal with for the rest of his life. If you want to write off the kid then you should definitely write off the mother as well. 

All that being said, I don't think you should contact him op. If he were interested in your mother or any of her other kids he would have tried to contact you or her. He hasn't, so he must not be interested."

Cancel the date.  This guy is not looking out for your best interests, and he's not going to listen if you decide you want to stop once you're there.  You can find someone else cute who will understand if public orgies aren't your idea of the perfect first meeting with some random stranger and his even more random ""friends."""
521,Right? Child support is like nothing. Most people I know pay less than $300 a month. Why was he paying for an apartment and who knows what else?

523,Does he have any black friends? They need to have a come to Jesus moment with this guy.
524,"Tell him good luck finding a house with toddlers that is clean. Your kids come before a pan being washed.

My husband and I have a verbal tug of war about cleanliness and we don't even have kids (we're 33 and 43 and don't want any). I leave crumbs on the counter from time to time and maybe a dish in the sink AND THATS IT. So his idea of 'clean' is different than mine. He still gets upset about it and I just shrug my shoulders. 

You can't read his mind on what he considers clean either. Sounds like he's a bit passive aggressive. Tell him to use his words and quit being passive aggressive."
525,"&gt; He's got to be questioning your motives there in some way. I know I would if in his shoes.

527,"To put this as nicely as possible: you don't sound like someone who is much fun to hang out with.  the passive aggression just oozes off of you.

528,"Are you Canadian? Because as far as I know the age of consent is 16 here. That doesn't take away from your dad's creepiness, though, and I know from experience - my dad fucked my friend from fourth grade for a while (we were both 18 at the time), and though it's over 10 years since I found out about it, I still get creepy shivers like spiders are crawling on my skin. 

I would recommend going NC/ extremely extremely extremely low contact with your father. He's dragging you and your sister down and you don't deserve that. "
529,"&gt; asking repeatedly is going to cause more issues

With a sufficiently diplomatic style of communication, talking about things repeatedly doesn't ""cause issues"" so much as just expose them to the light of day. Perhaps that's what you meant, but if OP's unhappy, there will be ""issues"" (for her) whether or not she speaks up. So I would say don't just speak up once, but rather speak up as needed, bearing in mind that negative feedback is about 5x as memorable to your partner as positive reinforcement, such that you do need to maintain (ideally) a 5:1 ratio of positive feedback to special requests."
530,"Uhhh either you trust your current BF enough not to string you along after moving in with you that you shouldn't have to marry him before that, or you don't trust him that much in which case you shouldn't be marrying him at all.

Do not bind yourself to someone legally because you haven't properly dealt with your personal issues from your past relationship."
531,"Tell her you have no ragrats for the time you got to spend together, but it just isn't working. "
532,"8 months,  5 timezones, guy who can't deal constructively with relationship issues... why are you wasting your time? 


What's the end game? Why are you so far apart? "
533,"So he's cheated on you, lied to you, shown over and over that he doesn't care about or respect you feelings, puts her above you and then promises to change but never does. You know this is over right?"
534,"there is no room for forgiveness on choking your partner. him being half asleep means he was half awake too. and not just that, but listen to /u/misclitoris (dat username :P). it's not just that he choked you when he was drunk, it's that he's not acknowledging that he was in the wrong or that he was shocked etc this happened like ANY good normal healthy SO would. he just brushed it under the rug and dismissed your feelings about getting FUCKING CHOKED. THOSE things make no room for forgiveness.

&gt; If he was choking me you better believe he'd quite drinking or whatever else would help solve the issue because he would be horrified and wouldn't ever want it to happen again.

does that describe what your boyfriend is doing? nope. also, listen to your gut on this. you know this isn't right and don't like it, you don't like what your mom is telling you defending him, so listen to your gut. abuse victims never think ""i just know he is the type of person to hit / choke me!"" they think ""he would never do something like this""

like on top of ALL OF THAT, this guy gets drunk enough that he starts choking his SO? who the fuck does that? no one in their right mind would want to stay around that mess of a man. no room for forgiveness. he should be so shocked that he goes completely cold turkey and is afraid to even drink again, he fucking choked you god damn"
535,It dries your mouth which then let's bacteria grow. Breathing through the nose (if you can) is always recommended in physical activity from running to yoga.
536,"&gt; I don't tell my SO every person I see everyday. There have been several times when I'll mention three days later ""oh! I can't believe I forgot to tell you who I saw the other day!"" or ""I forgot to tell you I grabbed lunch with [coworker], guess what they told me."" People forget things.

Do you then text those people and tell them ""I didn't tell my SO that I saw you today""? That's not the same situation at *all*. She didn't forget, otherwise the text wouldn't have existed. None of your hypothetical justifications explain it away.

Faux-flirtatious works for two reasons: it's over-the-top enough that both parties know it's not serious, and it's with someone that your SO knows you'll never actually be interested in. Neither of those are true in this scenario."
537,"I call at least half of my friends babe, I'm a bit confused as to why that is an issue?"
538,You're a fool if you think the age difference is irrelevant here. Would you date an 18 year old? Or would you feel like they're really immature and you're at different stages of life so how could it possibly work out? You two are at vastly different points in life and he seems to be handling his separation and relationship with you immaturely.
539,"&gt;  I never received any appreciation then but hey, I was doing it for her and that was important.

&gt; she no longer feels that she has to apologise for her mistakes (not that she would prior to the counselling) 

It sounds like you've always had problems with your wife's behavior (lack of appreciation, lack of apologies) and her new attitude is just magnifying them. This means that you might have a lot of material to look at as you think about your interactions and behaviors as a couple over the course of your relationship. I second the suggestion for couple's counseling to help you piece through it. "
540,"She pays him rent. This gives her sub tenant status. He can probably kick her out, but he has to follow the legal procedures of their state. "
541,"you couldn't see anything from the outside! i looked at them, even using a flashlight.  he has long, narrow, curvy ear canals that are particularly conducive to getting plugged with wax and difficult to clean.  he gets them flushed at his annual checkup now"
542,"Everybody reacts to situations like this differently. He obviously cares for his grandfather a lot and this is affecting him badly. And to be completely honest with you, for a lot of your post I was confused because it just seemed like you were talking about how shitty his family were treating him as regards to including him in the situation. "
543,"So, and you're free to take this any way you want, what are you getting out of this relationship?  

Because to this outsider, it sounds like the answer is ""not much"".  Do not make people in your life a priority when they have only made you an option.  It's unfair to you and selfish of them."
544,"I'm sorry but I think it's a little hypocritical that you don't trust her, but yet you're having a close relationship with a coworker that you are interested in dating and moving forward with. And this coworker knows that you would date her if you weren't in a relationship. Seems kind of inappropriate to me.

Those are some major concerns about where you will be living, and financially. I agree with other comments, I think you should have a talk with her stating these concerns and that it could be difficult to move your relationship forward if things stay like this. Give her a chance to improve on things. No one is perfect, and you will never be head over heels for someone if you don't communicate with them.

The grass is greener where you water it. But you have to decide if you want to put in that effort, or if you think she is worth it to you.

I just wouldn't want you to end this relationship, date the new girl, and have a similar situation in 2.5 years when the honeymoon phase ends."
545,"I'd just like to say that I agree with your fiance. Every single point she has made. It is inappropriate for these girls to be texting you, and you responding. Especially since you are well aware it makes her uncomfortable. 

If you want to keep your relationship you need to shut it down with these girls *now*. "
546,Thank you.  Your last point really struck a chord with me. 
547,"At no point did I say she couldn't get off as well.  I try to never be sexually graphic in my comments, but apparently I have to make an exception...  

Going a no-oral route could help her gain her confidence back because she is now overly-obsessed with her smell.  If his face is not down there and she is not obsessing, then she may be able to relax and enjoy herself and get back into physical intimacy again.  She can get back into feeling sexual with him by having him touch her in other ways.  For examples...he could: play with her nipples and/or clit, make-out with her, finger her, use toys, or even have penetrative sex.  Anything OTHER than oral, since that is what she is currently most concerned about.  

EDIT: Left out a word."
548,"I make my own tacos plenty. Fresh ingredients, seasonings, lalalala... And it's delicious! But it's different.

When I'm craving Taco Bell, I don't want my home made tacos.

When I'm craving Chickfila, I don't want my home made chicken tenders.

Most home made meals are an ""improvement"" on fast food equivalents. But if you have a craving for that particular fast food, no home made meal really satisfies you like the real deal."
549,"It sounds like two of the good dates were from before you were really over your ex, so those don't count as much.  Maybe the women picked up on something with you.  Did you talk about your ex during the dates?  Don't do that.  

Date 5 could have gone well, perhaps, but you were still upset about Date 4.  

When you say that the conversation was great on a date, was it pretty even on both sides, or did one of you do significantly more of the talking than the other.  Most of the dates I went on that I thought were bad and the guy thought were good had significant imbalance in the conversation.  Either he didn't let me get a word in edgewise or I had to practically force him to say much of anything.  Both are bad.  

Another thing, a lot of the women you are dating are kind of too young for you.  A 33yo man isn't going to have a lot in common with a 22-24yo woman.  You're likely in a different phase of your life.  

I would also recommend talking to your friends about suggestions they'd give to you, especially if you have female friends.  Encourage them to be honest.

Finally, when you say you didn't hear from the women again, you did try to contact them for a second date when you wanted one, right?  You didn't wait for them to call you?  "
550,you are going to run into more problems in the future...... I hope you learn how to deal with them instead of blaming others
551,"Never make someone the #1 priority in your life if you are only #2 (or worse!) in theirs. 

She wants to go out and screw this guy and act the fool while throwing you and your relationship away, she doesn't get to do that and then come back home like everything is okay once he tires of her."
552,"nope on out of there.

He's the one who made it into a physical altercation. you were trying to leave. "
553,"Why do you have to tell your family about the student loans?  That's between you and your in-laws.

And if your family takes offense at a smaller wedding that they don't have to pay for, then that's very petty of them, don't you think?"
554,"So, to make this pithy:  Your boyfriend needed space and time, during which he apparently required you to wait by the phone unendingly for his call.  When he finally decided to call you, it was at an inopportune time for you and you said you'd call him back.  He took this as a major affront and is throwing a tantrum.

Does this sum it up?

This is a very strange and unhealthy relationship.  I have no advice other than you two seem to need to kind of grow up."
555,"I'm 39 and happily partying on the wall. Or something.

If I'm post-wall, all it means is it's easier to weed out the redpillers."
556,"Make a preemptive strike and dump him first. If he even has to consider his ""choice"", he is not worth your time."
557,"I know that everyone's telling you not to let him rip out your IUD with his bare hands... and that's good advice so I'm gonna leave that alone. 

But my first thought was ""hm... this guy's already got 2 kids, has baby fever really bad *and* **got you pregnant within 3 months of dating**""? If you didn't have an IUD already, I'd suggest you check your condoms for holes. "
558,And can this dude even afford 3 kids?  That's a massive amount of money.
559,"&gt; So essentially in my eyes this test confirms that she is very, very materialistic. 

Careful.  Receiving Gifts is also my lowest love language and I struggle not to see them as being shallow too.  But it's not being shallow.  It's about feeling loved.  Gifts don't have to be expensive.  But they do have to be thoughtful.

&gt; Am I wrong to be angry that most of the nice things that I have done seem not to register? 

Yes.  You don't get to decide for her what she finds loving.  

Love is a deliberate intentional act.  The fact that it's not natural to you means that when you ARE doing it, it will be very obvious to her that you are making an effort and only doing it BECAUSE you are wanting to demonstrate love to her.

&gt; And am I wrong to feel less special, because anyone can give a gift?

How were all of the other things you thought were loving unique to you, and things that nobody else could have done?

&gt; Now I am angry that nothing I have done for her seems to matter and confused at whether we have any path forward. Am I wrong to feel this way?

Yes.  The way forward is for you to start developing and speaking her love language.  Nobody expects you to be amazingly fluent in it over night.  Be here's some things that you can do that 

* Leaving little notes around the house or in their lunchbox

* Writing a poem, or painting a picture that you think will be special to her

* Surprising her with her favourite beer or a flower or chocolate after a hard day at work

* Plan to make her birthday special and memorable

* Give her gift vouchers to a spa

* Start growing flowers in your garden so you can offer them to her each day

It's not all about the money.  It IS all about the thoughtfulness."
560,"Can you imagine being at home with your newborn baby, with this guy out cheating on you, then coming home at night and wanting to hold your son after he walks through the door? 

Not assuming you want kids, but staying with this guy could turn your life into a tragedy. 

I had to end an engagement once, and it was one of the most terrifying things I'd ever had to do. But what helped me do it is that my fear of being trapped in a marriage with that person became greater than my fear of ending everything. 

YOU. CAN. DO. THIS. You are a strong, powerful woman and even if you have to face hell itself you will conquer and find deep, lasting love from someone you deserve. "
561,It's not a good idea to pretend to be more religious than you are when you're trying to avoid a religous person.
562,"Yeah, it's possible it's cartoons or what not, but I wasn't even allowed to watch TV until I was about 16 and I was scared out of my mind aboud demons, the devil, possession, ghosts, spirits, and such before that because I'd learned about exorcisms and excising the devil and stuff from church and school. So it could be something like that IDK"
563,"I have this. Just two or so weeks ago, I started screaming in the middle of the night (scared the hell out of my boyfriend) because I was seeing a man at the end of my bed and he was trying to reach out and grab me. Most of the time I can't even scream, but this time I could. And even as a 27-year-old woman I started questioning if it was actually a ghost because it felt so real, even though I KNOW it's not and I don't even really believe in ghosts. For kids, it's 1000x worse. 

I feel bad for your brother, OP. Tell your parents about sleep paralysis and hallucinations. Maybe print out some easy to understand stuff about it to even read to your brother (nothing too scary or specific). It feels so freaking real but I promise him, it's not. "
564,"If this were me, and we had decided that we didn't want anything serious at the start, then the sex with other people wouldn't be the hang up, it would be you keeping it from me. Covering it up would make me think that there's more to it than sex, throw in that they're friends (that you presumably still see regularly) and it becomes a bigger issue. Where if you had been upfront during the 'casual' side of the relationship, then I would have been a bit insecure about it, but eventually gotten over my own issues."
565,"Hi OP, have you heard of Turia Pitt? I believe you can relate to her story. She participated in a marathon and got caught in bushfire. Similar to you, her partner stayed with her and now they are engaged. 

Edit: her partner wasn't responsible for her incident. Just want to point out that some people will actually stay and be with you, even after your physical changes."
566,"You ignored the part where the first poster said ""it would definitely be problematic behavior."" No one said that behavior would be okay, it would still definitely be creepy - it just wouldn't be sexist or misandrist, because society at large doesn't objectify men in the same way that women are objectified. Context matters, and sexism doesn't ""go both ways."" I recommend googling why you can't be sexist to men."
567,"If there's one thing I've learned from this subreddit, it's that when a guy picks on your nails, you need to *run* while you still have at least a shred of intact self-esteem.  It's a detail that only the worst kind of control freaks even notice, let alone consider important enough to yell at you about.

If you don't find that reason enough to break up, though...pretend for a minute that you are 100% sure you want kids.  Do you think your daughters should have to deal with the criticism and expectations and assumptions about ""what every woman wants"" your fiance is trying to place on you?  Is this how you want your sons to treat their girlfriends?

I know you love the guy.  But I get the feeling the reason he keeps coming back to you is that he's invested this much time in trying to mold you into his perfect Stepford wife, and he doesn't want to start the process over with someone else who might be less accommodating.  Listen to the voice in your head, stand up for yourself - the *real* you, not the one he thinks you should be just because you're a girl - and walk away for good."
568,But she also tried to lie to OP. 
569,Sounds like you'd be better off without her.  Cut your losses and leave.
570,"It sounds like your friend got you drunk to assault you, I'm sorry. I'd start by telling your girlfriend pretty much what you've said here: that your friend came around with alcohol, was insistent that you drink it, and that the circumstances you woke up in make you feel like you were taken advantage of. You haven't cheated &amp; that girl is NOT your friend. I hope your gf supports you thru this bc you're definitely not at fault."
571,"If she's not playing and just harassing staff, then getting surveillance involved and your Director will absolutely get her banned. She's not worth keeping around with all the issues she's causing!"
572,"You'd be better off working on finding friends and working out how to connect with people, you don't sound like you're ready for a relationship. You don't learn how to build meaningful personal interactions by sitting at home swiping right. If you've never had a female friend there will almost certainly be something slightly off in the way you talk to women online. Do you interact with women at work or at the gym? Or even with a sister or female cousin? Basically you need to learn to be around women as people, not as potential sex."
573,"I wonder if the OP simply hasn't noticed that she regularly takes it off, though. I never mention taking mine off to my spouse, and I do take mine off quite a bit. He also does for his job. We've been married around 20 years now and just maybe 4-5 years ago we were out with some friends and he was talking about almost losing his ring during a work trip, and at one point said, ""And I would have felt extra bad because she *never* takes hers off!"" I thought he was going a bit crazy as I take mine off all the time (I take it off for at least a few hours a day for safety during something I do with a high risk of hand injuries, and I often forget to put it back on so it's pretty common for me to go days without it). Turns out he simply never noticed and assumed I always wore mine.

Now, my husband can be remarkably oblivious, but it's pretty common to not notice little things like that unless you're looking for them. It's quite possible that she routinely takes off her ring and the OP only noticed this time because he happened to find it.

She might be being shady, too, but I've found that it's usually best to assume good faith when going into a discussion like this with your spouse unless you have damn good reason to be suspicious. If you start out accusing them and there's an innocent explanation, then *you're* the one undermining your marriage."
574,"Your husband needs to put his big boy pants on and just come out and tell his family.

You and your mom are doing nothing wrong and *his* family needs to remember not all practice their faith or want to observe it."
575,"They're correct in that speaking to one another in French while involved in a larger group or conversation is incredibly rude. If you or your girlfriend struggled with the primary language being spoken that's one thing, but if you're fluent in it and are switching to French anyway, yes, tacky and pretentious as hell.

On the second point, pronouncing something properly is just that, pronouncing something properly. Some people do it to seem more sophisticated, sure, but if you're not correcting others or poking fun at those pronouncing the words the localized way, shrug it off."
576,"So what if they're the girl's biological grandparents? Family should be held to a higher standard than others, not a lower one. Unhealthy people are unhealthy people, regardless of biological connections. "
577,"Yeah I agree. To be honest I find the top comments here quite strange. I don't think it's age appropriate at all and I'd be really weirded out by seeing this. 
"
578,"So, do you have any friends with alopecia who really like hackysack and Phish? Maybe you could re-sell it to one of them for $1000 or so. ;)

Regarding OP - you've got to give yourself a break. Mistakes happen, and they cost us some money, and we learn a lesson. Sometimes it's going through a red-light camera, sometimes it's marrying the wrong person and having to get divorced."
579,I'm glad you've realized that. You need to be honest with your gf and let her choose her next step. Personally I'd 100% leave you.
580,Are you paying insurance and registration on both cars? Both are in your name? Do you store your car on your parents' property. Sell or give back the other one. Use the money you save to move our. Maybe closer to work that is an hour away.
581,It's the fact that it didn't happen with the first kid but is happening now that made me think it is one of those two things. The sudden onset of the problem could be an indicator there are other factors at play.
582,Sounds like your parents are going to miss their grandchildren for a long time. 
583,I'm going to guess Rainbow vacuum cleaners.
584,"I actually think she'd be on Reddit either way, probably saying 'I decided to go on a trip to Munich but my bf can't go and he's upset about it'. I think it has more to do with OP wanting to go on her own without her SO, though absolutely she does need to work on her communication. We see posts here all the time where one SO regards trips as 'ruined' if they can't go with their partner, whereas the other partner is mystified or feels that they should be able to go regardless. "
585,"No, OP. He was a person. Just like your boyfriend. A person with likable qualities, with sad stories, with hopes and challenges. A person who also chose to do terrible things to his partner because his value system is fucked up and he wasn't motivated to fix it. 

There is no bright line between your boyfriend and this guy. No human/animal distinction. They are both people who made choices to treat other people badly, because it was gratifying. It got them what they wanted. "
586,"Is the issue she's fixing imaginary, or is it visual? It can't be both."
587,"Yep. Some people find it easier to use the same flat amount as a contribution, and others do it as a % of income. You two can decide what would work for you, though!"
588,"Another example I have of my hubby not understanding running a home was when asked what I wanted for my first mother's day. I said I wanted to do nothing but sit and watch TV.

Well the day started with calls from my dad about taking my mom out for lunch. So strike one - he hadn't taken time to inform family not to stop by or call or take care of our moms. Then we didn't have stuff to make breakfast, so grocery shopping. Then we ended going out for lunch to avoid a family meltdown. Then we got home and none of chores were done, dinner still had to be made. So I ended mother's day crying as I cleaned. He told me just not to clean. Well guess who is a SAHM and would have to clean it the next morning? So would it really be a break? Nope.

Doing nothing is lots of work. I asked for a day just to have a break but ended up with no break because nobody picked up the slack. He hadn't planned anything. Grocery shopping, cleaning, family obligations, cooking. We talked and he didn't realize all I did for the family. That one day took planning, thought and time. He had thought my plan to watch TV all day was going to be easy. Now we hire a babysitter once a week because it's so much better than him doing it. The house is clean, the kids asleep,fed ECT. When he tries I have hungry kids, a huge mess in every room and a melting down hubby."
589,"Looks like he replied a lot more since I posted. If that's the case then yea her being upset makes sense. He's basically saying I want to be a teenager again. Nothing wrong with that if you have the means, but you have to understand why a partner wouldn't want to sign up for that. "
590,Most likely he doesn't think it counts unless there's a dick involved.
591,"&gt; I don't particularly enjoy my job. 

Find another job you like more?"
592,"If you want to try one last time, lay it all out on the table, everything wrong with the relationship, and tell her that if it doesn't change, you're leaving.

Otherwise, leave.  Just because she sacrificed a lot for your relationship doesn't mean you need to stay if you're miserable."
593,"Yeah the first few times you use it that does happen. But if you do it for a few nights in a row you should see a difference. If not, I'd get medical advice. "
594,"&gt;  But when they came over to greet us after the ceremony they ran up to him and hugged him and they said hi to him but they didn't even say hi to me or look at me. This happened the whole night. They were sitting at the same table as us during the reception but they never spoke to me then either. 

And he didn't notice that they ignored you?? WTF."
595,Please don't stay in a relationship with someone that was basically a predator because her child will miss you. The girl will get over it. 
596,"That would mean her basically sitting on his injured leg. It might go fine, but I can see being really nervous about that hurting like a motherfucker."
597,Don't let your husband say a word of anything useful to you until he apologizes. This is ridiculous. If he can't trust his own spouse over some guy he was having an *argument* with then what the fuck is he even doing being in a relationship? He's clearly not mature enough. 
598,[removed]
599,"&gt; I want her to know what a shitty thing she did to me. How much she hurt me. What a shitty person she has apparently become.

Dude, that is not a good reason to meet up with an ex and you know it.

&gt;Again, I believe it's necessary to work through stuff.

Yes, it is. *Constructively.* Not destructively. This will only make things worse. Go no contact and move on with your life."
600,"My husband is quickly approaching conversational-level Spanish just from working on an ambulance in Texas for a few years. He's not even interested in learning Spanish! It's really not that difficult to pick up other romance languages, especially when you have somebody to talk to."
601,"The next time she does it publicly, you gently but clearly say ""friend, you are doing it again."" She will ask what. You say ""The anxiety compulsion where you try to make other people uncomfortable because you feel insecure. You are safe here, you're among friends. Do your breathing exercises."" 

If she lashes out, turn to whomever you are with and say ""I apologize for Friend. She doesn't mean to be like this. She's safe with us, right guys?""

Every. Single. Time.

As for when she does it one on one, you say ""Friend, I know you are feeling insecure right now, and you want to question me on a subject I don't want to discuss. So I think that is enough time spent together today.""

Pack up and leave. 
"
602,"&gt; No, I think she tries to ""talk"" to me in her love language. She gives me little gifts all the time but generally overlooks my needs. She doesn't enjoy going out and doing things with me, and she feels cold and detached to me.

Right, so BOTH of you need to work on understanding and learning to speak each other's love language.  Right?"
603,"""I broke up with my girlfriend because she still parties with people she had sex with"" sounds rather reasonable to me."
604,"&gt; I know I should have reminded him, but I forgot.

NO. It is not your job to remind him of his responsibilities to himself and his family. WTF is up with people who need other people to remind of them of shit like this? Your bf is not fucking 5 years old and you're not his mother sending him off to school.

He is copping what he deserves because he fucked up. 

&gt; He also has a habit of getting defensive and acting like he's not totally at fault. He didn't actually apologize for his mistake, and just said he was sorry he had to work, as if it was unavoidable.

This is why his family is still mad at him. Why didn't he offer to pay for the meal he missed? If this is really his favourite cousin, and he's really embarrassed and apologetic, he would be owning up properly and working on some actions to take to make amends. "
605,Let us know what she says after you ask her about it.  It's not 'stealing' but it is going against the set up of accounts you guys had agreed to.  You don't need to be aggressive and attack her.  Just say 'I noticed there was a $350 transfer to your account.  What was that for?'
606,[removed]
607,"Precisely. 

OP, do you want to be a parent or do you want to have a partner? Not trying to be harsh here, but I just wasted almost seven years with a very similar person. You can't build a life with someone who doesn't want to take responsibility for their actions and would rather pretend everything is OK than try to fix things. "
608,"Exactly. What kind of father practically kicks his son out of his house to go live with his sister with only the clothes he's wearing, then has the gall to ask him to forgive the ones who caused it? "
609,"If they had been engaged or dating for a year that's different. This is a 3rd date. If they are in an exclusive relationship that's cheating. This sounds like sabotage so that the girl doesn't end up dating someone exclusively. 

Edit: even if you thought they were exclusive the way you spilled the beans was poor judgement. But they said it was a 3rd date. You knew they weren't engaged or together for a long time. That was you being a crappy friend. "
610,"I think some of her issues are the classic ""repressed Christian"" situation. She grew up extremely religious and got sexual with this guy BECAUSE SHE FREAKING WANTED TO AND SHE'S AN ADULT HUMAN BEING, but upon doing so, she's disgusted with herself and ""what she did,"" even though there is literally no reason to be upset. 


She then took it one step worse and used the guy to vicariously beat herself up."
611,"When ever your SO has someone in their life that either dictates your SO's actions, or your SO defers to their feelings you are in for a rough relationship road.   Luis will always be a friend longer than you are his GF.  

Like many people on reddit will say, the sandwich may be made with the finest ingredient and be the most delicious sandwich ever, but if it's got small pieces of shit in you are still eating shit.  Mark may have a lot of good qualities, but he's got some deal breaker issues.  Being in a relationship and hoping the other person changes significantly is usually a losing proposition.  "
612,"Maybe you should just break up with him since superficial things like this bother you so bad. It's incredibly hard to find a job after graduating. That's not his fault since he is trying. I would hate to be dating you to be completely honest. There is nothing wrong with a man being a receptionist, and you seem pretty sexist. "
613,"I would imagine she's done a lot of fixing situations just to placate him. She's sick of it. I don't know if you've ever had a loved one who acts like this but it is absolutely exhausting. You're constantly on the hook for fixing things since they're too overwhelmed to deal with it and just spiral out of control.

She rightfully is sick of having to work around his anger problem. *He's* the one flipping out, so she gave him the solution to *his* distress: just fix it."
614,THIS IS ALL I KEPT THINKING!! What a stupid thing to say!! So the money she earns is their money and the money he could hypothetically earn is HIS money that he wouldn't want to share anyway. This dude is a jackass.

617,"Also, I think your username is funny so I looked at your post history, and one of your posts is this: 

Me [26F] with my boyfriend [31M] of 6 years, One week into a break is he already into someone else?

You need to break it off, stop waiting around for him."
618,"Seriously. Does your husband even understand the amount of effort it then takes to keep and maintain a home after you're approved to buy one? You can't buy a home that doesn't allow for wiggle room. You're going to be responsible for repairs, maintenance, wear and tear, etc. Your plan to aggressively save for another year was spot-on. I don't understand why he would let this blow up a marriage, unless the truth is that it's just a whole lot of work he doesn't actually want to be doing (that's how it's coming across to me)."

620,"I think there's a larger issue here than the showers. You mentioned that your roommate is depressed. Is this actual, clinical depression, does he have other mental issues that you're describing using that word, is he just moody, etc.? If it's one of the former two, he might need to seek out actual therapy and help. If you decide to tackle the shower question with him in a heart to heart, you could even frame it in a light of caring about his well-being (which I'm sure you do already); ex., ""Roommate, you mentioned that you take long showers because you're depressed, I'm worried about your mental health and while showers might help you cope I think talking to someone will be a better long-term solution.""

You could also discuss alternative coping methods for him to use to help both of you out."
621,"This is really great advice and happy that I am not alone in this type of struggle. I have tried the advice about putting hard stop to things but sometimes I feel as though we are speaking a different language. For example, when I say thing like ""this is hurting our relationship when you don't let me know when you are in the mood until after the moment has passed"", her response is something like ""Oh.. well I thought this is what you wanted. I guess I won't tell you at all the next day. Sorry for that"".  With respect to the chores stuff, my thought process has changed about it all together. I used to do it because I got lucky 50% of the time, but now I do it because it's a pretty simple way that I know works that makes her happy -- which then makes me happy. It was a total shift in how I viewed it but it worked and I'm hoping it doesn't still lead to resentment as you mentioned."
622,"&gt; Unfortunately they would find a way to use that in the divorce to tamper with his parental rights.

Child custody arrangements are not decided based upon who cheated upon whom these days. I wouldn't consider that a serious, realistic concern at all. 

I would consider that divorcing a religious fundamentalist leaves your child in the custody of said fundamentalist part of the time (OP isn't getting sole custody and neither is his wife, most likely), leaving the kid without anyone at home to counterbalance the religious nonsense when he's with mom. While ""stay together for the kids"" is usually bad advice, it's something worth thinking about here."
623,"Stop excusing your behaviour!!! Jesus christ.  You are the definition of a serial cheat. You have no remorse or regret for what you have done. You think you are justified. It makes me sick.

I have also been in your position so I know what i'm talking about. Except the abuse i recieved was verbal, with things being thrown etc. Fear. Still no excuse to cheat.

I was selfish and it still makes me feel sick what I did. You are selfish, and you are in denial. I hope for your sake the guilt catches up to you. If not, do everyone else a favor and stay single."

638,"&gt; I feel like there is a whole sea of girls that aren't dealing with these insane issues.

Those girls didn't have their brothers killed in a drive-by shooting. 

Taking care of someone who is going through mourning is hard. But you're not asking how to help her heal or how to communicate​ your needs in this relationship. You're strongly hinting that you want to leave because you're not having fun anymore. And that makes you an asshole. 

When your partner is mourning, 8 weeks without sex isn't that long. Have some compassion. You don't have to stay. You're allowed to leave a relationship for any reason. But every relationships will go through hard times, deaths, and no-sex periods. 

Also, spare a thought for your girlfriend. You can walk away from this death. She can't. "

I see a lot of my 19-year-old self in you and after reading this OP and your comments a measly 5 years later, I am just so, so happy I didn't get caught up with a controlling man a decade older than me. I was also ""mature for my age."" I was being paid to go to college, had my shit together, blah blah blah.

But over time you know what I've learned? I had my shit together ***for a 19-year-old***. There's a really short, unimpressive list of shit I could have had together at that age. Very unimpressive to me at 24 and I am laughing at how unimpressed I will surely be by my 19-year-old self by the time I'm 30.

OP, it's not about you being mature or not. Do you really want to date a man who is impressed by a 19-year-old?

16-year-olds are *children*. Jesus, I teach teenagers and they're obnoxious! Keep a journal or something, read it in few years' time and see if you'll consider your current self as being mature. And frankly, if your thinking and opinions don't change drastically in that much time then I'm sorry, but you're simply, objectively, and factually not as mature as you think."

You know what would make me nay-say? Finding out that a man in a *six year* relationship chose to hide his girlfriend and go out with another woman. At best, he's an idiot, at worst, he's been cheating, and neither are good options. 

Demand that he post your relationship online and correct his coworkers, like, now. If on Facebook, make sure the privacy setting is public and not custom. Maybe tell his coworkers that he recently got back together with you a few months ago to avoid torpedoing his reputation at work. If my coworker did this I'd assume he was crazy."
666,"Dan's past and present behavior hurt you a lot. Is there any chance of getting into therapy to work through some of that? In some ways what he did is still controlling and limiting your actions. Learn to be free of him and your past.

Then, when they bring it up again, ""We've already discussed this. I haven't suddenly gotten better."" Then change the subject. If they persist, leave, hang up, don't engage. 

You cannot control their feelings, just like they cannot control yours. You may have to deal with the criticism for a while until they finally accept that you won't change your mind."

681,"When we were younger and in college he had classes with and tutored a girl that was literally a model. I saw her one day and commented that she was very pretty and his reaction was like, ""Who? Her?!? I hadn't noticed"". I found that very hard to believe as you can imagine. 

Years later he admitted that he was playing dumb. He didn't want me to feel insecure. The thing is I'm not insecure! I feel like we should be able to casually converse about obviously attractive women. 

Throughout the years, he has played dumb on numerous occasions, most recently with Irina. I've never suspected him of cheating and I do trust him, but this is a pattern with him. I don't need to be protected. I know that attractive women exist. I'm not going to unravel because he has a pretty coworker.

This situation is different. I was surprised that she had gone back to his hotel room. The toys and the condoms added to my suspicions. If he's not cheating and he's just into solo anal play that's almost equally surprising to me as he has been vehemently against trying it for years. "

685,"Eh personally if it were me and I went on a date on Tinder I'd drop you as soon as you said that you had been seeing other women. I don't date multiple people at once and honestly until a few months ago really reading Reddit comments here didn't even realize that people are so open with dating these days that they're dating multiple people at once. Seems weird to me personally and if Amanda is someone that told you how she hadn't slept with someone else in 9 months it was likely to reassure you that she was being monogamous. 

I personally would leave you and I think your guilty conscience probably is because you were getting inklings at how Amanda felt but you want to argue with semantics. Semantics is fine and will win you Reddit points of course and will leave you ""technically"" having done nothing wrong but unfortunately real life is messy and she probably won't take it as easily. Be delicate *when* you have the conversation but accept her decision and try not to justify it too much- you had feelings, you ignored them because you wanted to experience the other side anyways and since you technically didn't have a talk. I never had an exclusivity talk in any of my relationships, we were just *dating* from day 1 and then it progressed naturally. Nobody had to point out ""oh by the way we're not seeing others!"" and it might have not even occurred to her to do so. Lastly, for the love of Pete please go get an STD test regardless. Lots of STDs (such as Chlamydia) often can be asymptomatic in men and condoms aren't 100%.

That being said, a lot of this is just my perspective and as you see there are a lot of people who feel differently than I do as well, but you need to also be prepared for her to be hurt and end things, and you need to accept at least some responsibility in this. If you have feelings for each other and are dating frequently, she likely didn't feel she *needed* to have the exclusivity talk because it seems like one of those things that people talk about on Reddit a lot but don't actually happen all the time, you know? Kind of like how people hook up often but not many just upright say ""CAN I SEE AN UP TO DATE STD TEST"" even though on Reddit here everyone says don't have sex with someone without knowing they're 100% clean and being aware of their sexual health and status.

So yeah. That's just one other perspective for you."

Essentially they throw the single guys in the barracks (they're like college dorms). The married guys and gals, though, get housing allowance and can live in a house with their spouses.

So lots of guys sort of reason, ""well I love her. So I might as well marry her since I have more money than I know what to do with it. And if I marry her we can both live in a house. What's the worst that can happen?""

OK, I know it's a stretch. These young men and women (usually men though. Good on you ladies) marry early. You've known David for years. If all you feel is pragmatism towards him, don't marry.

695,"&gt; I hit my 37th rejection.

1. That's not that many, even for tall white guys.
2. If you're counting, then your attitude is the problem here, not your height or race.

You're extremely bitter, and when challenged you say, basically ""well, how could I not be?"".  The answer is *you could be a different person*.  Other people see more rejection and don't get bitter.  If it's a challenge for you not to be so bitter then *that's your problem and that's what you need to change*.

&gt; I'm hearing numerous horror stories about Indian girls who reject Indian guys in their teens to go for men outside the group but ten years later when they run out of options they go to the Indian guy who'd play the safe, boring and reliable bank who's acceptable to their parents.

How horrible!  Imagine, having to settle for someone who isn't a virgin!

Don't worry, I'm sure that's a healthy attitude which doesn't in any way cause potential partners to reject you.  It's not like many women will find that attitude ugly and repugnant!

&gt; I never did good on Tinder or OKC. I only get matches with obese people whom I'm not personally attracted to.

You post this, apparently without irony, in the middle of a rant about how WOMEN refuse to date you because of THEIR superficial standards and their unreasonable fixation on your personal characteristics.  How terrible; if only a woman could look past your physical form and find attraction to the real you!

...but no fatties, of course.  You have standards.

I'm trying to be sympathetic here, but you realise that this is just rediculous on its face, right?  That you are writing things which read like a parody?  Your core point is ""I want to date women much hotter than me!""

Okay.  I'd like a functioning lightsaber.  But I'm not getting one.  And you know what?  You're not going to get what you want either.  Not, at any rate, without a much better attitude.

&gt; It was my mother's fault 

It's always someone else's fault, isn't it?

&gt;  Well in that case, if money is the only reason I'd attract girls, I wouldn't receive genuine love anyway - I might as well use hookers. 

Quite apart from the repellent bitterness and fake cynicism, that's also not how actual human sexuality works.  We're attracted to people whom we find attractive.  There's no ""physical attraction"" and ""non physical attraction"".  A lot of women (and men!) *are*, in fact, legitimately attracted to personality, character, drive, success, etc.  These are fundamental traits that define who you are; it's understandable.

And here you are saying oh no, I don't want someone who likes me because of who I am; that's superficial!  I want someone who likes me because of how I *look*!

Which would be a bad attitude for anyone, but is especially destructive if you're not super attractive.  See the problem?

TL;DR:  You blame your genes, your society, every woman you've talked to, your parents, and your mom in particular.  What's funny is you haven't identified the actual issue:  You.  Your personality, your views, and your attitude.

(Seriously:  Can YOU imagine wanting to date someone with your toxic ""the world is stacked against me"" attitude?  Doesn't it just sound really *tiring*?  Why would you even want to hang out with a person like this?)

701,"I don't want to jump on the 'you need to be there for your wife and put your sexual desires aside' train, but I feel like you might not understand what she's going through. And if she hasn't opened up to you about it, that's not on you. But I think you two really need to talk about all of this and come to an understanding on multiple fronts of this whole situation because it seems like you want to work things out.

I get it if you're frustrated, both sexually and mentally/emotionally. But please remember, that endometriosis is not a joking matter. The pain is VERY intense and can last for hours or days. It leave many women severely depressed and bedridden. It can cause women to have spasms and severe abdominal pain. All of which are things that are aggravated by sex and sexual play/arousal. 

If your wife does anything with you/for you sexually, you need to understand that she is trying to have a good time but is more than likely fighting through A LOT of pain and discomfort both during and after the fact- while also trying to be sexy and make you happy. That's a stressful thing to deal with. And we all deal with stress in different ways. 

As others have mentioned, regardless of if you two want kids, she found out she most likely can never have them. Dealing with that brings on a lot of emotions. Her hormones are crazy.

703,"Paten should call Dave out on his bullshit about not getting involved, since Dave called Paten to get verification on you guys dating.

704,"And I've even seen kid shows, like Adventure Time, that parodied The Exorcist and similar things."
705,"Ya time to end things. He has physically restrained you multiple times before and that is abusive. Some people like to stay and argue others like to walk away and get some space to clear their heads. He is constantly preventing you from doing what you need to do when you fight which is unhealthy. But he is also physically restraining you which is not okay. 

Ya you hit him but that was to get out of his grip i.e. Self defense. Either way violence has entered this relationship one way or another and it would be unhealthy and toxic as fuck to stay. Especially to stay with a guy who physically restrains you when he doesn't want you doing things, gaslights you, forces you to lash out in self defense, and then uses that to gaslight even more while conveniently ignoring his physical restraining. "
706,"&gt;regardless of the fact i told her to move in and it wasnt even her idea.

No offense, this isn't helping your case. This was not a good idea, even if you offered. I get that you aren't a parent, but moving in with someone like this is going to have a massive effect on that kid. If you break up (which is likely, since you hardly know each other) , it's really going to mess with them.

&gt;My last relationship was bad and they all said that one was fine, now i get into a new relationship and everything they have to say is negative.

People on the outside can only give you advice on what they see. That's how so many abusive relationships last- they act super sweet in public, and then the monster comes out.

It's also possible you just have terrible friends, but having someone move in (and meeting their kid like this) is a huge red flag, even the most dense friend would be worried for you.

&gt;and it's going to fail 

The success rate of people who rush things like this is really, really low.

&gt;the fact that she had her shit together.

People who have their shit together don't just jump into moving in with a guy with their kid. Sorry dude. You might have good intentions, but this has all the signs of recklessness and bad judgement. 

Especially since you're both super young, and it sounds like you guys haven't even met in person more than a handful of times. Never mind that you still can't see why this might be a bad idea to rush so fast.

edit:
&gt;Idk, the negativity i'm getting from this just sucks tho

Yeah, negativity sucks. But your friends are obligated to tell you when you're making a mistake.

715,"Well, they have supported me. While they favor my sister over me there's a whole other side to their relationship with me. The day my husband passed my mom dropped everything and stayed with me for weeks. She took on the housework and helped me with my first daughter. She helped me find a new place to live and helped me fix up my resume to get a better job. She helped me out so much. My dad took care of helping pay off the rest of my debt and they both pulled together to help me relocate the right funds to get everyone to a beautifully thrown funeral. 

However, you are right that they do ultimately favor my sister. But after helping so so much and pushing me into support groups and therapy after the death of my husband so early in my life I can't distance myself from them. It truly isn't easy to distance self from family while still going through something like losing a spouse.

My husband's side of the family tried to sue me after his death for money. I paid off the rest of his dad's house and gave his sister tuition money and then parted ways after that wasn't enough for them. 

But yes, I am a part of several groups and I have many friends here. But the issue I ultimately need to solve is reconciliation with my family over something that I do understand but am conflicted on dealing with."

It IS a consolation trip, because you know she's disappointed that the friend trip isn't for her and you want to make it up to her. That's a thoughtful, caring gesture. You can't change everyone's plans to include her; the best you can do now is arrange an additional trip with her.


It's understandable that she's disappointed, but if she can't let go of the idea that she should be included in the original trip and just enjoy the ""consolation trip"", that's on her."

You should hold off on reporting him. You are not the victim, the victim is now an adult, and you have no proof. You can encourage Anna to report it or give you proof, but that's about it.

You should however talk a a lawyer. Both to discuss your mothers divorce and what your legal options are here. If you have proof of mental instability, drug use and soliciting sex from a minor a lawyer might be able to use that to speed up the divorce or compel your father to get treatment. But you should ask a lawyer what is actually legally possible. Start by asking in r/legaladvice about what you can do with the info you have in a court.

You should continue distancing yourself from your dad. He's sick in a way that will hurt you and your family if he gets the chance sadly.

Also, be sceptical of ""Anna"". She doesn't seem to stable herself, and don't get dragged into her issues becaue you feel responsible or sorry for for. You want info about your dad from her, but nothing else. Be prepared to establish and uphold some strong boundaries with her.

You and your sister, perhaps mom too, should make some appointments with a councellor and check out some support groups in the area.

I think this situation is unreasonable because they've been dating for 5 years, OP hasn't dated his ex for over 10, and OP barely uses Facebook/is not actively engaged in talking with his ex. If it was such an issue, why didn't OPs gf bring this up years ago? "
754,"This is total bullshit and it's textbook behavior for the kind of asshole that will eventually go on to treat YOU like shit (more than he already is, I mean). 

He doesn't think people deserve kindness and respect as a baseline. That means every time he's upset about something, every time you guys are having a disagreement, every time things are not going his way, he will treat YOU as shitty as he treats everyone else.

It will start slowly while he tries to keep his inner asshole under control long enough to lock in a victim, but the longer you stick around, the worse it will get.

Save yourself the time and heartache. Walk away now. "
755,"First off I'm sorry this happened to you. It's devastating to be blindsided by something like this.

Once you begin dating again you will see that there are men out there that will see your value and want to be a part of your life and want you to be in theirs fully. "
756,"&gt; Should I just straight up say this won't work out

Yep.  That is all you need to say.  The more detail you give, the more room you leave for him to try and argue you into changing your mind - and by your own admission, you're not really equipped to handle that temptation.  But please do realize that you don't actually owe this guy anything, including an explanation why you're not talking to him any more.  He already knows that by all rights, he should've been blocked a *long* time ago, and that the only reason it's gotten as far as it has is that he lucked into finding someone who's more concerned with not making him feel bad than defending her own boundaries.  Get him out of your head and focus on getting to a point where you don't feel like you have to settle for crumbs of affection from a would-be predator."

758,"Yeah, she's not going to get over it in 2 months, and isn't going to feel like having sex for some time.  She's traumatized and hardly obligated to meet OP's needs.  If OP isn't interested for the long haul he needs to tell her that he feels like he already lost his girlfriend."
759,What should you do? Nothing. What should your husband do? Put his foot down with her the way he should have a long time ago. Why is he letting a snotty teenager disrespect his wife in her own home? Why is she still allowed to come over? Why doesn't he call her out regarding her disgustingly sexual behavior towards him?
760,"&gt;My parents have expressed offense in the past that they don't see more of her when she's here.

Possibly because they don't want her to spend her time with *you*, and if she's with *everyone*, she won't be all alone with just *you*.


Also - yeah. There's no reason in hell he needs her address. Phone, sure. Address, no. Big no.

**Edit:** When my now wife would visit when I lived with my grandparents, my grandmother would literally *count the silverware* - which was NOT actual silver, mind you. Just regular forks and spoons - and swore to me that my girlfriend was stealing her paring knives. With a straight face.

Being uncomfortable with you/me having a girlfriend can come out in weird ways.

No, they are not right. Your girlfriend is 100% correct. Don't try to broker peace and/or have a 'conversation'. Just stand in between them and her until you get out and then the two of you can live your lives."

And I don't think Passover and Christmas are a fair comparison. Christmas you just have a meal and presents, but you're basically just spending time with family. It's much more similar to Hanukkah.

Passover is different because you're not socializing with family as much, mostly you're reading/listening to the Haggadah. Plus my mom doesn't know Hebrew (I don't either) and she is not super fluent in English either so there's a lot that she won't understand."

765,"&gt; On the other side she still in love with other man and she don't want to cut off their communication.

Which is really the only side that matters.  Whether she *wants* to cut him off is not the issue here: addicts don't want to give up their addiction, either, but that doesn't make it any less dangerous or damaging.  If she's not willing to acknowledge that the marriage can't survive - let alone heal - as long as she's maintaining one foot in a future with him, and commit to at least making sure she's giving fixing things with you her full attention before either of you makes a final decision, then you're just wasting your time.  No choice in this situation *is* a choice, and she's not choosing you.

If it's the latter, then maybe separate beds or bedrooms are the long-term solution for you as a couple.

Thirdly, I agree. I don't think you guys will (easily) move forward from this, if at all. You can't trust him. He's destroyed that trust. He's only continued to prove he did not respect what you guys had agreed to do to solve the problem and now you constantly are going to be checking his folders, which isn't healthy (but not unearned). 

Secondly, to reiterate my thirdly, I think you should break up. But if you want to approach him, as much as I hate ultimatums, that's what this needs to be. You need to lay out the storyline here of how you guys have already been over this multiple times. How he's agreed to keep them deleted (and hello, how'd he get these pictures back *again*? it's one thing to have them from before you started dating but he's saved *new* pictures of his friends?! are these girls openly posting their underwear pictures publicly or sending them to him?!), and hasn't kept that promise. How insecure it makes you feel, and that you've explained you have no issue with porn in general. It's crazy to me that he doesn't save pictures of you but does save pictures of female friends. You are totally in the right here. I think you can do way better (and should) but he needs to know this is *fucking serious*. I beg ya, OP, you can do better. "

I've also told them I do NOT want it near my fiancé. He's grown and makes his own decisions, but if they consider me a friend too, they'll take this into consideration. 
Then they come around, talk about drugs, ask if we know where to get them, etc. This is what bothers me. "

779,"Can you talk to HR? They can't manage your personal life, but they can address his inappropriate contact.

Also, does he have any authority over you at work? "
780,"See a mental health professional. That's my main advice. I have some other ideas that I've written below. Maybe they will be of use to you.

I think you do need to see her and talk to her at some point. You will be dealing with her as your life continues and that's true whether you two reconcile or end the marriage. Under the latter scenario, she will still be the co-parent of your kids. Heck, you should probably talk to her just to get a better sense of her attitude toward the marriage and how you feel about her. If you put off talking to her for too long, I think it will become this big thing in your mind. You'll feel even more freaked out at the idea of talking to her. 

Have her relatives been visiting her? If so, I would ask one of them to pass a message to her. The message should be that you want her to get well and were devastated by her near death, but that you were also hurt by finding out that she'd been cheating on you and that's why you have been avoiding her. That would like to see her, but it would be hard for you not to also bring up the affair, and you would like to know if she is feeling well enough to discuss that with you."
781,"This.  

Also to OP, from my experience, there's no recovery from this sort of betrayal.  Sure, you can make things work, but that's the thing, you'll just be MAKING it work and there may always be this shroud of doubt with your SO.  But you have kids, and ultimately, this is all up to you now, but damn, I am fucking sorry this happened to you.  I'd personally take the kids, dip out, and not give a single fuck about her state of health.  I'd start moving on yesterday.  There's nothing like knowing a person and loving them, then finding out this person you love isn't exactly that person, and from there, the love just becomes confusing and painful."
782,"Grow up. All you have to say is ""Sorry I have a BF"". It's not hard to do and it's not at all mean or aggressive. Just say it with confidence and remain friendly."
783,"&gt;  relax and let it happen naturally

This, with a healthy does of ""communicate with your partner about what you want in the relationship and where you see it going"" 

Have your actions match what you want also. if you feel you want to get more serious stop sleeping with other people (which tbh you should have told her about anyway- you should make your sexual partners aware of anyone new/else in the mix so they can protect themselves as they see fit.) 

If you're worried about blowing the FWB thing, approach the subject casually. You think she's pretty cool and you'd like to try being more with her than FWB. If she says no you play cool and accept it, quickly moving onto other topics. 

Still a bit of a risk, but less than if you act super weird about it. "
784,Tell him he crossed a line and you're not interested in being friends with him. Then block his number and social media and just cut him off. Just make it clean and simple. You don't need either of them in your life space If you feel like they're toxic.
785,"&gt;so it's not like it's ever going to go away.  

You're either able to move past it, or you aren't. If you aren't, you break up.  

&gt;I started going to therapy for a period of about 5 months starting in May of last year.  

So you're not in therapy anymore? You need to go back ASAP.  

--  

It's great that you've done so much for yourself to improve yourself and your mental health. Seriously that's great. But being in an unhealthy relationship (and it sounds unhealthy from both sides tbh) will plateau you, if not inevitably drag you back down.  

This sub pushes for breakups a lot. In your case I would strongly suggest it. You two need to part ways. "

I don't do that anymore though. It's just inconvenient to have washed underwear drying everywhere...which is worse.

Like, the society around him might be okay with it - but his family probably wouldn't - so he just might not even consider *trying* to pursue a family as a gay man. So you're the 'safe' option.

If I were you, I'd tell him that if you ever got married, it'd be to someone who you were madly in love with, and who you had a terrific sexual connection with, *as well* as the nicer more platonic types of connections. Tell him that you can't think of anything more depressing than being married to someone just because you can manage to get along and like each other - and that's exactly what you'd have with him.

First of all, duh, you're a a reformed addict. This is how it works. Being a reformed addict means making choices to separate yourself from your desire to use again, which you are doing quite well. He's the one fucking up here. 

Second of all its redirection/projection which is a manipulation tactic. It's not about being ""right"" or logical it's about manipulating you into agreeing with him so he can get his way by shutting you down with the shame of being an addict. In other words he wanted you to feel bad so you would shut up. 

Never take the bait and never respond with a rebuttal, don't play along because the resulting fight just distracts from the issue which is that NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO BRING DRUGS (DISCUSSION OR OTHERWISE) INTO THE HOME

does he do this a lot? If so, it's a sign of being abusive. Sad to say but drug abusers have a high comorbidity with people-abusers. Don't tolerate it. Stand firm, don't let him confuse you, Gaslight you or muddle the conversation by changing the subject or redirecting the focus onto you. 

Put your foot down. Either the drug talk leaves or you do. If being sober is important to you, fight for it. Fight for the life you want. I believe in you! "
794,"&gt;a friend of mine recently asked me ""If you were single, would I have a chance?""

#

&gt;I then asked him if he was interested in me and he said no

...you really believed him? You thought he just asked that for kicks?

I get where your boyfriend is coming from, completely, although I don't really think it's his place to tell you how to act with your friends. This is one of those things where you need to find someone who has compatible ideals with your own.

Honestly though if someone is going to stop being your friend because you reject their advances because you're already in a relationship, they're pretty shitty ""friends"" and I'd personally jump at the chance to cut people like this out of my life."

796,"I think OP did what he thought was best. It was with good intentions. But just because CPS was called does not mean that she's going to be taken out of the home. That's the equivalent to poking a bear and not having a safe way to escape. The girlfriend has a right to be angry. She's afraid. If CPS doesn't see any notable abuse she will be left to cope with the residual mess. That is the scary part and that is why we never take action unless we're certain the person will be placed into a safer situation. CPS was called on my mother when I was 17. Nothing was done. Instead I was left with the aftermath which was far scarier than the previous abuse. OP I hope for your girlfriend's sake she is placed into a safer environment. Otherwise it may get uglier. I don't know what other advice to give other than next time ensure that your girlfriend 100% has a escape plan and is ready to leave. I know everyone thinks CPS can be counted on... but I've had CPS, teachers, other parents, and even police officers all fail me. Despite what people think, domestic violent homes are really hard to escape. "
797,"I agree with your friend.

It's not her fault that you constantly offer to pay for things, say no when she offers to pay, and buy her things that she never even asks for. Then, after all that, you blame *her* for doing exactly what you told her to do (that is, not pay). I get that you were trying to be nice, but you lied about what you actually expected.

Splitting should have been very casual. All you had to do was keep track of your expenses and tell her what she owes you either after each bill or at the end of the trip. In the past, she's even asked you to do specifically this. But you refused, and then grew resentful for something she offered and you said no to.

You owe her an apology, imo, but at least follow her request and never pay for her again. If you do, learn to split. It's very easy through apps like venmo. If I had a friend like you, I'd assume you were very well off and did not need to be paid back (because you keep insisting not to!)."
