1,Don't buy a house with her.
2,"&gt; she told me early on is that she will never apologize for anything she says

This is bullshit for ""I'm an asshole.""

&gt; If I'm hurt or think something she said is rude, that's my fault for interpreting it that way because she didn't mean it that way.

So in other words, she'll say whatever she wants, but is never responsible for how poorly or incorrectly that message is received.

&gt; Am I wrong here?

No. No, you are not. 

&gt;  I was raised that if you hurt someone's feelings or you're rude to them, you apologize.

For the most part, yeah. 

&gt; What do I do?

You tell her that you are tired of having to accommodate her inability to think about how her words effect other people. That kind of emotional numbness is hurtful unto itself because it says ""I don't care enough about your feelings and emotions to consider them."" If she wants to continue being this way, you gotta decide whether that's something you want to stick around for."
3,"StuffMomNeverToldYou also just did a podcast on this. It's really interesting and they say that companies are preying on desperate women who want to feel empowered and have connections with other women. They may be more accepting to this because is a podcast for women and is really careful to be skeptic while not attacking the women involved, but the actual companies. Worth a shot."
4,"Flow chart time!

First talk to your husband to make sure you two are on the same page. Include that even if you two want it maybe she doesn't and that you both must respect that, also that you want to have all three of you agree to ground rules. If husband isn't interested then stop here.

If, your husband's answer is yes he is still interested then feel comfortable bringing it up to Amy in the form of the question of ""Hey remember that time we talked about having a threesome? So...you still interested? And are you cool with rules?"" If Amy says no stop here.

If yes then get everyone together and, this is important, BEFORE ALCOHOL discuss the ground rules. IMO try to have as few rules as possible so it is simpler, but to each their own. If you can't agree on ground rules stop here.

Hey did you get enough yeses to be here? Well then add alcohol and do what comes naturally!

(Big thing: number one rule is that anyone can call stop at anytime and nobody gets to feel resentment. Also another safe rule is nobody gets to feel left out, if anyone does then stop and start at the beginning.)"
5,"Maybe I was being a little rough on the guy, true. And maybe to him, it doesn't add anything but paperwork and stress. 

But we're also talking about a guy who has known for at least the last two years that marriage is a priority for her. Him willfully ignoring the conversation says to me that either he doesn't care what she wants, or that he doesn't want marriage.

and either way is bad news bears."
6,"I mean, yeah, snoooping = bad. You'll get enough of those comments here.

Real talk - Feelings don't just magically disappear from people. Especially if the breakups didn't end on her terms. That being said, it should not actually lessen or make her feelings for you any less real. I love my partner - from very early on I knew I wanted it all with him. But I still had feelings for a previous guy, different, more overwhelming feelings. But he was not and never will be the person I should be with.  I'm sorry you are feeling hurt, but honestly, just trust her and let her get over it on her own time in her own way as long as it's not actually harming your relationship. Just my two cents."
7,"I don't understand this. With marriage, you are legally 1 financial unit, but you aren't acting as one realistically, which is troublesome."
8,"He did it to isolate you.  Less of a chance of people finding out what he's like if he gets you to feel ashamed of opening up to other people about anything.

I'm really sorry.  "

10,Doing Ketamine and Drinking Alcohol are not the same thing. I hope I don't have to explain to you why
11,"This is ridiculous.  You're an adult, and a VERY young adult.  ""The next step"" is a totally stupid idea.  There is no guideline to existence.  You know who needs to have kids?  Nobody.  You know who definitely needs to *not* have kids?  You and your wife, while you're unhappy and completely incompatible.  Getting married at 19 is crazy in itself.  

There are always more jobs.  There are always more people.  If your family disowns you, then it looks like you have one more motivation to do something different.  If you lose your job, you have one more motivation to find a new one.  If you get divorced, you get another chance to find happiness in yourself and with others.

You aren't a victim.  Neither is your wife.  You two just don't work together and it's totally fine, just get divorced, move one, do better.

Also, keeping a job as a minister when you were willing to cheat on your wife to hopefully force her to divorce you makes you pretty corrupt.  Maybe go for a different kind of career, and make better choices."
12,"I'm waiting with baited breath for my brother and his new wife to get pregnant, in hopes that will buy me some peace. But ironically, they're all telling him *not* to have kids anytime soon, not for years anyways. 

As an aside, it's funny that you mentioned that, because my grandma actually *just* told me this past Saturday that she wants to have a ""private"" conversation with me about that. Which I am **not** thrilled about, and am pretty sure I will avoid at all costs."
13,"Even if he wants you back, look at how this guy deals with problems. You told a mild joke, and he kicked you out/broke up with you for crying. Holy shit, when the problems get bigger than laundry, I'd be scared."
14,"I....can't really blame OP here. Unless *she* suggested in the group that it was a kink, she didn't do anything other than discuss some weird behavior she witnessed. She was probably trying to fish for advice (because that's...what people do when they're not sure what to do).

If anything, fuck the friends. A pedophile? What an asshole suggestion. That shit's serious.  "
15,"Honestly, it is repeated often that you shouldn't buy a house with somebody unless you are married. There is a reason for that. This guy has two condos and isn't willing to sell ONE to make HIS dream come true. That's a red flag. Don't sell your house."
16,"There is r/Missing_Person/ 

But it's maybe worth posting it to r/pics as well. You'll likely get some asshole responses there, but it is also a huge sub, so more people may see it. "

18,"At your age, you should know how to clean without specific instructions.  

The best way to ruin a woman's sexual attraction to you is to turn her into your mommy, just fyi.

Words are cheap, actions count.  Your girlfriend judges you on your actions, or lack thereof.  If you want to change people's perception of how you act, you have to change how you act.

I think your girlfriend views you accurately, it's your self perception that is off."

20,"It doesn't sound like Heidi is doing particularly good work, though. He's been complaining about her performance for months. And I doubt anything his wife said over lunch could have resulted in her being fired if she was performing well."
21,"they're not ""wired"", they're taught. "
22,My husband is one of those children who's stepparent resented him and didn't love him- it has affected him and his self esteem his whole life
23,"You don't seem to have communicated all this to your husband first.

*I know this might be a sensitive subject, but the way you manage your hair is driving me mad. Would you be up to try a few suggestions of mine?*"
24,"Delete them. 

Laugh

Profit"
25,That's the thing about apologies...you have to actually mean them and commit to changing the behavior/mindset that led to the incident for them to work.
26,"I am very sorry your own insecurities apparently led you to make this comment. I've dated men MUCH older than me in the past, do find older men very attractive, and I have absolutely no issues with aging, so I'm not sure why you felt the need to make that up. I am not lying to myself, or to anyone else, when I say I love my husband - that's why I'm so concerned about his well-being. Everyone else (including my therapist) has given me excellent and compassionate advice about improving this situation, it's unfortunately only you who felt the need to be a smug douchebag today. "
27,"She's trying to pressure him to have a baby while his mom is dying. She is wrong, period. If she's that terrible at handling her grief, she needs a grief counselor, not a baby. She is being terrible to her husband when he needs support. "
28,"But its not her fault at all!

She's punishing both of you for reasons beyond both your and her control, and that's at least a little weird."
29,"Aww, sweetie.  What you are experiencing here is cognitive dissonance.  The fairy tale he presented to you is vastly different than reality as it was.  It's going to take a lot of time and mental energy to process it.  And you're going to go through a lot of emotions - grief, bargaining, re-living it, wondering if was there something more you could have done, until you finally get to anger.  It's going to be a long road to totally heal.

You have finally seen his true colors, the person he was underneath all along.  You have to let go of the Prince Charming facade that he presented to you in the first place.

Use the month to figure out what to do next.  He's not going to really try, just ride out the time until your move out date - so don't put in a lot of effort on your part.  If you do decide to try, at the very least have a Plan B in case it doesn't work out.  Try to imagine life if you didn't move in with him.  Do you like your job and new city?  Can you see yourself building a life there?  Do you want to stay in a place where you might run into him?  Do you prefer to be in your old life closer to family? 

It's not your fault he deceived you.  He took advantage of your trust because he knew he needed a respectable cover as a settled 'adult' instead of living like a debauched college kid.

Take the next best step for you.  Do whatever is best for you career and yourself at this point - the universe moved you to a new city, maybe there's going to be new opportunities and people here; if you need the comforts of family then there is no shame in moving back either.  Just don't factor him in your future plans.  Good luck."
30,"Neither of you seem to want to compromise, If you're that opposed to it then break up with him. "

32,"&gt;I allow him to use porn or whatever outlet when I am not home.

You don't ""allow"" him to do anything.  You allow yourself to be in a relationship with someone who likes to look at porn.  If that's a dealbreaker for you, you need to allow yourself to leave.

If he doesn't see it as an issue, but is willing to change his behavior, and you're willing to give him the chance, then do that."
33,"I studied abroad in Prague, and my university (Vysoka Skoka Ekonomica) had counseling services. It may still be something you can look into."
34,"I mean, she genuinely loves him and wants to stay with him. If there's a way for him to *become* more attractive to her, it would save their relationship. Sometimes a band-aid is all it takes to heal a wound. "
35,"Would it be possible to try to handle the confrontation before the concert rather than as it's happening? How do you think she'll react if you text her that it's nice she going to see a band she likes you want to make sure that you are going to this concert as a special date with your husband and will have absolutly no time to hang out with her, even at the concert itself. If she reacts by dismissing you, then you can be more assertive in explaining your boundary and at the concert be (and perhaps more importantly feel) justified in completly shutting her out and not giving in to her manipulation tactics. If she gets upset and start an argument, then she will be angry and ignore you at the concert.

Sometimes an argument is unavoidable, but you can control the setting of it to be the least unpleasent for yourself. So adressing it ahead of time might be to your advantage."
36,"I'm not saying his argument isn't reasonable, saying it's hypocritical. If he's allowed to have other things to make him attractive that aren't his appearance, his wife should be given the same courtesy. "
37,"Gaslighting is abuse that involves intentional lies about your memory of events. Minimizing or belittling your emotions is absolutely rude and insulting. If it's a pattern of that behavior, it's abusive, but it isn't gaslighting."

39,Giving the benefit of the doubt it could be really far away. I knew people at uni who stayed in remote parts of the country where the nearest mall was 2+ hours away by train so they rarely went.
40,"If your brother is going to potentially beat you best to leave the talking to someone else. Could you anonymously report your brother to your teachers? And maybe just talk to the gay kid yourself, give him the support he needs?"
41,"More importantly, away from her mother."
42,"That's the sorta thing you send someone before you murder them.

I dunno if he loves her, or he's just gonna keep her skin as a rug; regardless, if you're not comfortable dissolving the bones in your bathtub, that's a perfectly reasonable limit and nobody would judge you for leaving."
43,"If you ""really don't see yourself having kids"" then don't date people with kids. Because if it gets serious and long term you WILL be a step parent whether you like it or not. "
44,"When I was a kid, those kind of punishments didn't really teach me anything other then to not get caught. I never understood on an empathetic level why it was wrong. Maybe that's the issue, your son was punished, but is he actually sorry? Or is he sorry he got caught? "
45,"I find it disingenuous since you weren't married to him. He wasn't your husband and applying that label to a now dead relationship feels off. Can you imagine an ex running around making stuff up about your old relationship? It wouldn't be fair at all.

As for people telling you that you should feel one way or the other, ignore them. They don't get to dictate your feelings. Though I would assume that you're excited to start a life with your current partner because taking a relationship to those steps is supposed to be excited your first or fourth time.

&gt;I also get annoyed that people who got a license kind of get ""credit"" for a relationship, where we didn't.

Do you often compare your relationships to those of other people?"
46,"i don't KNOW why anyone else doesn't mention how it's weird he actually has pics of other women on his phone. if my boyfriend had the audacity to do that, i'd break up with him solely off that"
47,"I don't know if I'd be hurt, but I'd be weirded out.

This is such a strange concern. She's upset that people underestimate a former relationship? Well, that relationship ended over 4 years ago. Why is she even still talking to people about him..."
48,"It has been three years. He's not changing. He's pushing you and forcing you to walk on egg shells out of fear. 

You are going to get hurt and you need to take care of yourself. "
49,"Look give it some time.  Everyone wants to shoot the messenger instead of laying blame at the feet of the perpetrator.  I don't know why people are like this but they are.  I got my sister to call the police when her husband was abusing her and he got arrested and had to spend the night in jail, everyone including my own girlfriend, were disappointed and telling me I had done the wrong thing encouraging her to call.  My sister was furious and yelling at me because she didn't expect him to get arrested she just wanted a paper trail.  And then there was a restraining order and he couldn't come home.  And CPS got involved because her youngest was involved in the incident.  But boy did I turn out to be right.  And eventually months down the line everyone had to eat crow and admit they were wrong.  

Right now everyone is deep in damage control, denial, anger, bargaining, grief etc. and you were the one who rained all that truth on everyone's head. Eventually the anger is going to land where it should.  Affairs can cost people their lives.  People get killed over them.  It is at its essence an act of abuse though it doesn't count as domestic abuse.  You did the right thing and ultimately you did right by everyone including your brother.  The sooner he got found out the sooner the damage he is causing his family and children could stop.  "
50,"You just learned your boyfriend is a raving misogynist who doesn't trust you, and thinks you have no morals. I think you know what to do with that information."
51,"&gt;Finally, don't be mean about it, but if he smells bad, also don't be afraid to tell him! 

My brother couldn't even smell his babies' dirty diapers. He had to look or touch to figure out if they needed changing, instead of sniff testing. Some people just have no real sense of smell. You may have to teach him things like ""When you leave out wet things, they mildew and it's unhealthy and smelly. When you sweat at work or the gym, it makes you stink - please take a shower before interacting with other humans (who aren't there working with you)."" If his parents didn't explain basic hygiene to him, he might not be able to sense the problem himself."
52,"Right? Like, if I can eat your booty without a second's hesitation, then I can handle a little bit of pee in the shower. I know it's not a direct equivalent, but us humans regularly deal with body fluids and other grossness without being squeamish."
53,"What are the positive qualities of your husband?  Did he used to do birthday things?  Did all this stop after the birth of your child?  Do you think he is working a lot more to provide the caretaker role?

Dynamics change, especially when a child gets involved and you've been married for a little bit.  What might have been a 'go all out' night when you were just dating can change into a bottle of wine and tv, when you're working and have a toddler (if you're lucky).

I think you just need to sit him down and talk about expectations and what makes you feel good in the relationship while acknowledging that you're in a much more busy time in your partnership.

To him, maybe he thinks working while you go to school and do the stay at home thing is enough to show he cares, who knows (hint: he does)."
54,"I'm willing to bet it has an awesome case, it's a fucking 1500 dollar sword, so obviously... He should ""display"" it somewhere that won't disrupt the aesthetic of the room (i.e office, hallway, or hell, the garage...), up high, maybe even in a locked glass case. The ""no swords in the house"" rule is ridiculous. Do he and his wife not own kitchen knives? "

56,"The pornfree sub is way healthier.  They advocate doing what works for you,  including masturbation and sex. Just no porn.  They're really supportive and none of the weird Dr. Strangelove essence stuff either. "
57,"Even if he does get signed, what does that mean for you? Do you keep working a atring of crappy jobs? Do you quit and follow him around everywhere, always relying on him to pay your bills? What if you fight? What if you break up? One of the only things that no one can ever take away from you is an education. It's also one of the only ways to make sure you can always take care of yourself."
58,"You've proven yourself unworthy of that faith at present. You'll have to work to earn it again.

Your brother and sister fuck around but they don't have letters saying they did zero work. Why do you think you're entitled to the same treatment when you don't earn it by doing your schoolwork?"
59,"This man, thank god, managed to defend himself against his childhood abuser who tracked him down. If he hasn't of broken the abusers arm and shouted as a show of power he could be in hospital or dead. You could have been hurt too!

Yes violence is scary but what he went through, facing his abuser, is a thousand times worse.

You can stop being scared by not dwelling on how it affects you and focus on what your boyfriend is going through. Have some empathy and go round and comfort him, because he needs it more than you."
60,"You have a stalker. Although the legal stuff can be expensive, you need a restraining order. Take screenshots of everything he sends you as evidence.

62,"I wouldn't be getting it to please others any more than cutting my hair, straightening my teeth, fixing a broken tooth (I spend $3000 every few years because the crowns on my front teeth break so often.) getting a tattoo, or wearing cute shoes is for others. I do things for myself.

Man, people have some serious baggage around cosmetic surgery in this thread.

EDIT to be clear, I haven't had cosmetic surgery and probably never will but to see it as more vain than fixing teeth or more frivolous than a new bike or gaming computer or something that's enjoyable yet not vital to living is hypocritical."
63,"So many people in every proposal/engagement thread here say ""Well maybe [woman] should propose to [man], did you ever think of that? Bet you didn't, hah!"" type of stuff. But as a woman in my late 20s who is (very) recently engaged, the _vast_ majority of straight men I know would not want to have their female partner to propose to them. They mostly consider it their 'job' and their role in the relationship.

Not only that - you should never ask someone to marry you when you aren't sure if they want it. The person who officially proposes should already know that the other person is interested in marriage - it's more a ""let's officially do this"" than a ""are you interested"" step. To suggest that these women propose to their partners, when the partners are saying they 'aren't ready', is nonsense."

67,"Just a thought from a new nurse (so take it with a grain of salt).  It's OK to look a little nicer in scrubs.  On the floors I've been on, the nurses that are a little neater in appearance (hair together, neat scrubs, earrings) tend to be the ones that advance.  There are some opportunities to advance that I have noticed - be on a committee or a task force, apply for a position that makes a bit more money, train the newbies.  

You have denigrated your job several times through this post, but nursing is a very important and difficult job.  I'm a little closer to nursing school, and I really remember all the complicated ad difficult things we have to learn to do our jobs.  It is highly skilled and the most trusted profession in the US.  Yes, we do have to do some menial things for people, but we are ready to save their lives if they need us to.  You could have a job upgrade simply by changing your personal rhetoric about your job.  You don't have to believe it at first, but just try saying positive things about your profession.  Tell your husband one or two challenging things that happened each day - brag on yourself!  Demand respect for your work, and you will feel your self worth grow.  "

69,"Don't you dare let this attention seeking trouble maker make you alter your plans. 

Part of this problem is the nature of offices. People at work are giving her exactly what she wants: attention and an audience. This would all end pretty quickly if people would just walk away or have the courage to say to her ""Oh *troublemaker*.. you know that's not true."""
70,Except... she has always said that she doesn't want to change her name. Where do you get your logic from?
71,"Are you seeing someone for your anxiety and body image concerns?  At this point you are making the choice to allow this to keep you from enjoying life, to the point that you are almost not going on vacation to meet your partners' family for the first time.  This kind of thing is going to keep coming up and it makes sense to do whatever work is needed to be secure enough in yourself to successfully navigate these situations. You'd rather be seen as aloof than actually have fun and have them get to know you for fear they will judge your body.  Think about that for a minute.  If you really are overweight no amount of extra clothing is going to hide that and covering up often just draws more attention to it then being secure in yourself.  I know it isn't easy, but look at this as an opportunity to work on your confidence.  Google plus size beach looks and find something you are comfortable in.  I'm not saying you need to get in the water this time around.  I'm saying that sitting and doing nothing because you are worried about what people think of you is contributing to the problem.  Right now you can't get in the water because you're worried about how you will look/ that will look, you can't sit on the beach and read because you're worried about how you will look/ that will look, basically you're saying all you can do is sit on the sidelines and watch at other people having fun with no recognition of a) how THAT looks or b) what you are missing out on by doing that.

It's okay to not get in the water, to plan outfits around sitting on the beach, etc.  but you do need to recognize that your solutions are also going to cause potential awkward moments that may reflect in a different way than you intend them to."
72,"Man, I was like your husband til wife told me to come up with a good reason why she should change her name. And goddamnit, I had no good reason. It's just an archaic practice, and until

73,"Is he close to his parents? Are you close to his parents? 

You cannot force someone to change, but given that you are young, married and have a child on the way, once he is out of the hospital, it might be worthwhile to stage an ""intervention"" (ideally with immediate family if appropriate) to see if you can convey to him just how serious his situation is."

75,Older man who exclusively goes after younger women is someone who likes feeling intellectually superior to others. What a surprise.

And it seems a bit de trop to worry that the cake is ""really gay"" when there are two women getting married at the centre of the event.
"
77,"Honestly, some of these comments are being very harsh about you not wanting to take in the child, and trying to make you feel bad for being ""heartless"" for not wanting to immediately take in your neice. 

Yes, OP made distasteful remarks about sterilisation and how the child is destroying the family but it is NOT his responsibility to take care of the child. His wife will feel more responsibility as it is her niece, but OP is allowed to not feel comfortable in taking in an abused child, one which will most likely have a few issues that might make her hard to handle.

Yes, she does need care and support. But what she doesn't need is to be put in a large-ish family with two children (one of which that already needs a lot of attention because he's a baby) that are planning to move and where one parent feels like they can't take care of her. 

It would be incredibly hard to just slot in a child who will most likely need a lot of support. OP is allowed to not want to have this. His wife is also allowed to want to put in the effort and support - but the differing ideals might be a deal breaker. It's not about ""having a space in his heart"" to immediately accept her. He is allowed to feel pity and want to support his wife's neice without adopting her.

Stop trying to shame him into taking in a child that needs to have things that OP cannot give her."

79,"In my experience, cutting out porn and masturbation can be extremely helpful to a relationship, but it has to be something both partners want to try. If you feel forced to give up porn it will just create resentment in the relationship. It can also take anywhere from a couple weeks to a couple months for your body to reset and arousal for your partner to return.

 You've become accustomed to seeing very stimulating images, and that can make it difficult for you to be turned on by a real life nude person- and I could also see that causing confusion about your sexuality.

 As an example of ways porn might effect sexuality, it's extremely common  for straight women to watch lesbian porn.  Partly because it's more erotic/romantic than straight porn, but partly because female bodies are seen in a much more sexualized way than male bodies. Many ""straight"" women and ""gay"" men identify as bisexual (straight and gay in the sense of only desiring romantic and sexual encounters with men) and I think there's a real possibility this has to do with the strong focus on attractive female bodies in pornography. Frequent porn use a huge effect on what we find attractive and arousing. 

Of course I'm not an expert, but it's something to consider."

Not only should (imo) you never stay with someone who cheats, you should NEVER EVER stay with them if they make you feel like shit about your feelings about THEIR actions.

Don't wait around for this loser. Seriously, what the fuck are you even doing, catering to him and letting HIS terms dictate? That kinda courtesy was out the window the moment he cheated.

Dump. Dump. Dump.

"
92,"Fostering might not *make* OP money, but at our shelter they provide the food and necessary supplies to the fosters, so there would be little to no cost."
93,Inappropriate? You're not 16. You're 22/23. 
94,"My point was that OP is not entirely blameless here either so she should be realistic about what the issue is, what the causes were and use that to temper how she approaches her girlfriend and how angry she is at her. It's pretty rich to be livid with someone for not taking a responsibility that is also yours, and not promptly completing a messy, unpleasant task you've never done yourself."
95,"Sometimes it's fun to be a little petty though, I can guarantee she'd cry and call you all the names under the sun if you did which will show her up as the hypocrite she sounds. Good luck OP! Just remember you deserve better than her :)"
96,"Lol, you didn't type a single redeeming quality that you like about your girlfriend. Just end it and find someone that is more compatible with you and your lifestyle.  "
97,"Yes yes yes! We have issues with my MIL because it's very clear the relationship we have with her is all about her. I get that same reading here.

If you're only concerned about having a relationship with my kid for you (so you can play grandma, etc) then I'm not okay with that.

Think about what you asked: why does she get more than I do? Not: how can I be closer to my son and his family? How can I bond with my grandchild when I live so far away?

If you really cared about your son and his family, this wouldn't be a contest. It would be about you taking responsibility and making an effort to build a positive relationship there. "
98,"When he was growing up, he was your minor child. Now he's an adult, and anything related to his sex life with his wife is between him and his wife.

Because that's what fertility choices are really about. You're wanting to be privy to the details of his sex life."
99,"Out of curiosity, do you have Asian or Indian parents?  I've only ever seen these type of posts (parents offering the use of their child's home to friends or relatives without first asking the children) when dealing with those cultures. Just curious. 

In any event, a couple questions:

1. Do your parents own or pay rent on that condo?

2. Do your parents still provide you financial support?

If the answer to either of those questions is ""yes,"" then you need to ask yourself if you are willing/able to risk losing that financial support. 

If the answer to both questions is ""no,"" then you owe your mom nothing and can tell her a firm ""no, they cannot stay here.""  Part of growing up is making sure you act like an adult, and occasionally making sure other people know that you are an adult. If you back down here, expect her to keep treating you like a child. 

And, regarding your boyfriend, do not under any circumstances have your mom give him a ride downtown for work. She already doesn't like him, and I 100% promise you she will do passive aggressive shit like making him late in an attempt to get him fired so that she can say something like, ""now he doesn't even have a job!  How can he support you?""  "
100,"He isn't interested. He knows that you are. You've made that clear. Had he changed his mind, he could have initiated any time in the past two months. But he hasn't.

If you try again he will definitely reject you and possibly end the friendship."
101,Thats a pretty rude comment from someone asking the internet for advice. Their comment was perfectly polite and to the point. Their delivery did not suck.
102,"Thank you. I have talked with him in depth and he claims he is not bi, but he dates women just to make his family happy.

His HIV status isn't a big deal for him because both his parents are big time lawyers and can afford his meds, but that doesn't mean anything for any girl or guy he might infect. And I hate to say this, but I feel like gay guys should know the risk, but a girl is innocent and doesn't know that a guy has this and sleeps with men. I consider myself a feminist even though i'm male and I don't want to see black women or any women hurt, so I had to betray him. I feel bad, but at the same time I know I was right."
103,What the fuck is the matter with you?? Are you insane? You'd endanger your life anf you future family over this?
104,"The ""slip up"" in the entire point of this post is that he's been fucking around on her for months with multiple women, without protection.

What perceived ""slip up"" do *you* think she's wrongfully leaving him and filing for child support for?

*(Setting aside the absurd notion that child support is used as payback instead of payforward for the children you participate in creating.)*"

106,"Eh, One Direction fans and other similar female fandomers have been shat on plenty of times, so it's not exactly a gender thing I don't think. Girls who have similar obsessions with *insert character/celebrity here* don't exactly do well in relationships either"
107,It sounds like you're not that invested in your relationship and are looking for reasons to end it. 
108,"Yes, but one of the beautiful things about a long term relationship is that you build a shorthand with each other. You know what a shift of the eyes in certain circumstances means. You know that touching them here or there means you are feeling a certain way. A squeeze on the arm or a facial expression can convey a lot of information for some couples. 

20 years together and my husband and I can communicate a lot with no one else knowing anything is happening."
109,"Don't believe anything he says.  He's shifting the blame onto you, it's a guilt and manipulation tactic used by cheaters. In fact all of his behavior you described is textbook cheater. You will probably never get the answers you are looking for, the best thing you can do is gtfo before you get hurt worse. I'm sorry. "
110,[removed]
111,Isn't it at all possible that she didn't agree to this arrangement and is venting about it? I must be missing something. 
112,[deleted]
113,What world? She is an adult. She is no longer wanted at OPs house. He is not legally responsible criminally or civilly. Stop playing fake lawyer. You can kick other adults out of your residence that dont live there. 
114,ABSOLUTELY 100% agree with this. 
115,"You are right to be concerned. His treatment of you and the dog are not ok. Find a new home for the dog and yourself (not necessarily the same home). Until you can find a new home for yourself, lock your door. Buy a chain or lock if there isn't an adequate one. If your mom says anything, tell her you are done being abused by your brother. That the things he's done/doing are not ok and you will not accept the treatment. "
116,"Yeah my wife and I tend to agree. I personally don't think he was on a ham radio message board but that's the story we got. The fact is, it's difficult to mistakenly upload a pic. It had to be open on his desktop or whatever. We don't know how many images he has, but frankly speaking, one is too many."
117,"&gt; stop carrying on before I smack you. Or if you don't stop, I'm going to knock you out.

Get out. Now. "
118,Predators wouldn't get away with anything if they walked around with horns and pointy tails.
119,You've only been dating for two years! I've been with my partner that long and we are massively attracted to each other. When we met I was a size 14 (size 12 now) and he was still super into me. Don't use time as an excuse when it sounds like you've always been lukewarm towards her and a poor sexual partner to boot. 
120,"I guess the concern is also that once bf discovers that OP is in fact not the only female in existence who acts like this, will there be anything deeper to keep them in this relationship?"
121,"Block these losers. They don't get to hurt you and then try to worm their way back into your life. You deserve better.

The likeliest case is that everyone is giving them a really hard time (as they should) about their crappy behavior and if they get you to come over to their side they might get accepted by your friend group again. I bet they're pretty lonely right about now.

Cut contact. You don't owe them anything."
122,"&gt; Not sure if that warrants a medical visit, but I suppose it wouldn't hurt.

Absolutely can't hurt, only help. Stress is not something to be played around with. Take it from someone who got stress-related shingles at the age of 22. You don't want that."
123,I think you watch too much porn. 
124,[removed]
125,"You're being abused. You're being threatened and lied to. There is no way to reason with this person. Just leave and cut off all contact. Get a restraining order if you need to. Document all instances of abuse. Write down all the things that happen when she's abusing you with dates and details. It doesn't matter if other people don't believe you, you know the truth. Your main goal now should be to protect yourself. You come first, remember that. Be strong enough to leave for yourself. What she does after you leave her is not your concern. She seems so volatile and violent that I would just suggest you leave out of the blue without giving her an explanation. If you talk to her about breaking up, that will only give her another opportunity to try to manipulate you or to hurt you. Do not give her that chance. Take care of yourself. "
126,"Some people have legitimate mental issues, but a lot of people are just inconsiderate. My brother is like that. He'll tune out when other people start talking, and you can't engage him, unless it's on a very limited number of topics that interest him. His attention span is measured in seconds, and he'll start fidgeting, checking his phone, looking in the mirror, etc when someone is talking to him for even a short length of time. He doesn't have mental problems; he's just a jerk."
127,I'm giving up my career for all them babies right now!
128,"&gt; we'll grab 12 boosters out of the box, each of us get 6 boosters. We build a 40 card deck out of them, and play with that! 

Another option is buying one of the duel deck sets. "
129,"Not really.  Last time they made a serious effort to reconnect it was by having a Aunt call to tell me they were throwing all the stuff I'd left at my childhood home going to college away because the kitchen flooded and the dumpster was there, so why not?  She told me if I wanted anything saved I needed to call.

I took the bait and called, but it turned out to be a trick.  My mom threw my dad under the bus for coming up with that one almost immediately and I haven't responded to messages from them or the Aunt since.

So no, no apologies or good terms..."
130,"Uh huh. You may be surprised to hear many grown ups have private shit they don't want people going through. If you are cool with people tossing through everything you own from your sex toys to your tax returns, good for you. Most adults value privacy.  

Roomie could have opened her fucking mouth like a regular person if she wanted to negotiate rent or trade rooms with OP. At any time in the last 8 months.  "
131,"Ultimately, this is what your girlfriend feels. She feels neglected. If you are saying that's not happening, you need to figure out why she feels like it is.

20 hours a week on anything that isn't generating income is a lot of time."
132,This post is confusing.
133,"If she had approached OP about the situation like an adult, instead of childishly swapping the rooms while OP was away, then I would agree with you. But now? Forget it. "
134,"Mate, if you use enough ketamine to have a dedicated spoon you are not compatible with this girl."
135,"I feel like this is clearly written at a bias, like there aren't all the details here.

Have you had issues with her being explosive at little things before? Are there other instances in which she's acted like this? Or is this the only one?

Or is it that you've had some mishaps with cars in the past and she's worried because of that?

People don't get furious like that over something as small as you've described. There's a reason, but you haven't necessarily provided enough context for reddit to decipher."
136,"Run. Please. She is abusing you. Sleep deprivation is a form of *torture*. Please don't leave her with your son - the way she is acting is NOT normal and could be a sign of mental illness. 
She stole your wallet. 

Start keeping a list of the things she does. If she scratches you, take photos of the wound and put them on an online/cloud drive she can't get access to. Please get help. "
137,"I've _never_ had a guy leave that easily. The first couple I ended up moving out because they wouldn't. 

The last one was an ""unemployed pothead"" for too long. He finally acquired employment but the issues never resolved, so after his first 30 days on the job, I asked him to move (late February). I wasn't leaving this time since I was there first, I had kids, and he wasn't even on the lease (just my name, the kids, and 1 extra ""unnamed adult""). 

By April he hadn't even looked. I ended up doing the house hunting for him, found a place, made him meet me there with the property owner, and dropped his completed paperwork and deposit off at their office for him. Move in date of May first. 

He was still in my fucking house come June. His new place sat empty. We ended up arguing about it one day, he momentarily put his hand on my throat, and that was it. All trace of him gone within 2 days. It was either that or I call the cops (he had never been physical with me at any point in the prior 4 years living together, so just having him gone was good enough).

I was prepared to legally evict him by July first at that point, anyway. So, yeah, some dumped SOs will hang on as long as they can. "
138,This is hands down the best answer. 
139,"We don't even know the wife did something to specifically get her fired.

She may have had a hand in it, and realizes she did, but may not have even done it with that intent regardless of how she felt for the girl. She may have just been venting to old friends from the company."
140,[deleted]
141,"I guess I'm in the minority here, but... it's not just your living situation that's changed, and she resents you for it. It's not that far fetched to see why. Babies are loud and even you say ""a handful."" 

Some people like babies all well and fine, but would rather not live with one, and that's okay! Let's not turn this woman into a villain for being upset there's two more people in a small house. "
142,"He's not ""in love"" with her at all. He's got a crush and his ego is all wound up in it. 

You cannot fall in love with someone who doesn't love you back. 


That's like saying you had great sex when really you were just jerking off. "
143,"I think that the biggest problem is that that revelation made you realize that you'll probably get another revelation about her trip six months from now. And then when you feel like you've recovered from that, she'll reveal something. And the longer you stay with her, the more trickles of truth you'll get. And you'll never know when she's finally told you everything. 

You really need to leave. You'll never be able to trust her again, and even if you do, you'll have to trick yourself because she's proven repeatedly that she can't be trusted. "
144,I really doubt he'd have raised you so well without loving you quite a bit too :) 
145,Could someone make this more generalistic and put it to the sidebar? It's fantastic advice for this kind of situation.
146,[deleted]
147,Don't listen to all the bogus advice from people pimping polyamory in here. It sounds like it's not your bag and that's totally okay - it's not most people's bag. But you need to recognize that this means the end of this relationship. It's game over. 
148,"Get therapy, dude. I used to romanticize toxic relationships when I was your age. YOUR RELATIONSHIP IS UNHEALTHY and her parents are right. Get some help."
149,"But he also lied to the step-mom about sending the gifts, so mentioning the gifts is fitting, though probably worth wording it better. Just clarify the baby hasn't received any gifts even though he told step-mom he did."
150,"I bet he has no issues remembering appointments/lectures/seminars for his double major, or he'd get kicked out for nonattendance."
151,"Why on earth is medical care the ""nuclear option.""  Obviously, you need more medical care, not Reddit."
152,"I don't even think making the mother like her is the point. She's willing to sacrifice her relationship with her bf to go yell at his mother. Sounds like she's got tunnel vision and is just on a mission to let the mom have it, consequences be damned. "
153,The fact that your husband's family expected YOU to send the card and got mad at you shows you exactly where his mindset comes from.
154,"Right like, him getting them from someone else is more creepy than if she sent them herself/he took the photos. That's some basic human decency shit that you shouldn't be partaking in at the age of 24"
155,"&gt; blinded by love so deep

I'd rephrase that to ""blinded by low self esteem so deep"". There is nothing about this situation that speaks of love. People in love treat each other with kindness and respect."
156,"You freely admit that you are ""paranoid"" and have no evidence of infidelity, so why are you snooping through her phone and ""monitoring her email""?  These are totally unacceptable within a healthy adult relationship; you're acting like a jealous teenager. I strongly suggest therapy or serious self-reflection to get to the root of why you're so untrusting of your wife without cause."
157,"I would recommend that you get therapy for yourself on how to deal with this much financial stress.  He endangered your child's daycare...that's divorce worthy.  Your entire post is full of red flags.  Maybe he was better than your ex...but this guy is not horrible with money...he is completely self centered.  That doesn't fly with having a kid.  And being married means you are one legal being so that whatever debts he has you would be liable for the entire amount if he doesn't pay.

Have you checked both of your credit reports lately???"
158,"Funny enough, I had the opposite experience. Since getting a foam mattress, I'm actually able to sleep without waking up with horrible back and neck pain. I never thought I could imagine the day when I would go without immense lower back pain. "
159,"Yes, Jake told them and you guys need counseling STAT. No joint family trips, full stop. Joint counseling. "
160,"I mean, some insecurity when other people think your partner is hot is kind of normal.  But you've got to own it as *your* problem, not your hot partner's, especially if (as you describe) your partner is not particularly seeking out that attention.  

Where your BF went wrong is that this is his problem and he's trying to make it your problem. More than that, he's making it a problem you don't really have any power to fix, short of permanently disfiguring yourself or something.

That's where I would challenge him: ""Honey, how do you see this problem being fixed?""  I suspect he's not really going to have a good answer, which hopefully might get some sense into him."
161,"&gt; I value my hearing and my sanity and I need some peace and quiet.

Then that is what you tell him. It's not that you don't like his singing, it's just that you would like some boundaries, because you enjoy peace and quiet. It might be helpful if you found yourself getting into classical music, so that you can play that in the car instead."
162,My wife and I would love to join you for dinner at your home. What time should we arrive?
163,"Give it a try next time. You'll shave a whole minute off your morning routine. 

While peeing in the shower is pretty normal, if she starts waffle stomping you have a real weirdo on your hands. "
164,"I was basically raised by wolves and don't have kids, so I'm sincerely curious when you say caring for a sick child is more than medicine and letting them sleep. What else is there?  My dad worked when I was small, and my mother wouldn't come near me because she was a generally selfish and didn't want me to get her sick. I was lucky if I got soup once. What is it you're actually supposed to do?"
165,"Well in our culture it's illegal and I hope she gets caught.

You don't want to be with a criminal.

Edit: oops I'm getting downvoted because laws are triggering to this crowd 🙄"
166,"So he lets you make all the plans, then stands you up last night, then promises to make it up to you by taking you out to lunch, then no-shows on that as well? Sounds like he doesn't really give a shit. Are you sure this is someone you want to commit the rest of your life to? "
167,If you can't be OK with him owning a cat that he doesn't assign 50% ownership to you -- then break up with him.  
168,This is definitely the point of no return. Abusers often wait for relationship milestones to reveal this behavior. So it's harder for you to leave. But you can still do it.
169,"He says he plays ~2-4 hours a day plus at least 4 hours a week at a game shop. I mean, that doesn't leave a ton of time in the day after work for being together, especially if he's underestimating the time in any way. 

One thing OP should consider doing is setting a timer and starting it the moment he begins playing and stop it when he finishes and see how much time is spent in a given week.  Also maybe consider if you're spending as much time in a week as you do playing MTG. If she gets less of your time, how much less time are you spending with her as compared to your hobby?"
170,[removed]
171,The language barrier is just part of the problem. The fact that your boyfriend doesn't stick up for you when his family is disrespectful to you is a bigger issue. You could start learning Spanish but he needs to learn to have your back and not let his family talk him into not translating or telling you what is going on. You can't do much about not understanding Spanish at the moment so it's up to him to grow a spine and not let his family treat you that way.
172,"You recieved great advice here. I don't want to add anything, I just want to give you a hug. Keep your head high, you can do this!"
173,"In a perfect world, HR will ""promote"" a positive working environment for the employees to bolster productivity and prevent the company from negative consequences, such as lawsuits. 

HR is created for the company, not the employees. A non specific complaint, such as my boss doesn't like me, won't do you any good. Unless there is ground for lawsuit, HR probably refers you to the next in the chain of command.

I guess Tina can file discrimination and ground for a hostile working environment and that will get HR involved. It won't be pretty and quite stressful frankly.

There is a fine line between what is real and what it should be. Alas, this is not a perfect world."
174,"This, this, this and MORE this!!!
OP, good on you for being so wonderful as to be concerned over your fiancées state of mind this week, and also for knowing deep down that this was an instant uninvited. 
Follow the advice above to the letter and your future wife will know you have her back when it absolutely matters most. 
I hope you have an amazing wedding this weekend and I wish you all the best for your married life together"
175,"I don't understand your question. OP literally asked for married women's opinions/experience on men being flirtatious at work. My opinion/experience is: it happens, and sometimes all you can do is make the best of it by brushing it off and never giving them the chance to act on it. If you have a problem with that, you are being unfair and unrealistic.

Again, I ask *you*, what should the wife do here to make her husband feel better?"
176,Thank you so much. I keep feeling like this is my fault but he really is just a creep. I am fairly confident that my friends will stick by me on this but worst comes to worst I don't have to see him after 9 weeks. I blocked him on Facebook and the messaging app that we are all using so hopefully he gets the signal. 
177,North of England - and please feel free to use it extensively. :)
178,Dude sounds like a real piece of work. 
179,"Is it hurtful because they are also being verbally abusive? Or is it hurtful because they have legitimate criticisms/complaints and you dislike having to face that you may have flaws? If it's the former; remove yourself physically from the situation and consider ending mutually toxic relationships. If it's the latter you need to learn to control your anger - when you feel the urge to lash out, remove yourself physically from the situation, take a breath and think about what the discussion is *actually* about and why you feel your position entitles you to have the total veto power.

Either way: Therapy. Get some anger management underway."
180,"But that's not the problem. OP says she is worried because he doesn't offer her any reasonings like that, he avoids these discussions, he just wants babies and that's it. That's pretty off-putting no matter how valid the reasons might be."
181,You don't deserve him. Can't believe you just packed your shit and left him like that. 
182,"This is how he wants to live his life. 

You can have a come to Jesus talk about the excessive phone calls, you can say, ""I feel that when you blow me off to spend time with your mom every single weekend, it makes me feel angry and lonely,"", you can even say, ""Either you commit to x number of days with me a week,"" but if he doesn't want to change, he won't. 

You should try to bring it up with him as a big picture event. Stop trying to text him, cajole him, bargain your way into spending time with you. Have a sit down discussion with him with concrete examples of behaviors that you'd like to change. 

""In the last week, I've figured out how much time you spend talking to or with your mom. You spoke with her for four hours on Wednesday from eight thirty till midnight, and again on Friday and Saturday. You dropped in for a quick visit on Thursday and Monday that both lasted three hours, and now you want to go this weekend to spend the entire time with them. We were supposed to go out together on Tuesday, and we had to visit your mom for nearly an hour before going to dinner. We haven't sat down and had a dinner or date night or spent time together to be a couple in months because this is what happens. I love you but it feels like I'm having to apply for weeks in advance to get even an afternoon with you and as soon as your mom calls, our plans go by the wayside."" 

Ask for the commitment to change. Regular date nights. Set aside weekends per month for his mom. Being able to have those boundaries. Put in place a deadline, even if you don't tell him it's a deadline. If in two months, you still see this/experience this attitude, why are you waiting for change that isn't coming? If he makes it clear, you won't win between him and his mother, stop asking him to choose. Get out and find someone who cares enough about you to not spend his time with his head wedged in his mother's house. 

If he doesn't want to change, if he doesn't want to commit to doing things a different way that prioritises you as a couple, he won't change. He has no incentive to change. You will end up playing the romantic girlfriend who does all his cooking, his cleaning, and his sexual needs to emotional-girlfriend-mother who does all the warm fuzzy emotional work and comforts him and keeps him firmly under her wing. You'll play second fiddle to a woman who doesn't want to give that up. "
183,"You're both seeing someone. Why would you say something? 

I get the wanting to be friends with an ex thing... but you're not a friend right now. You're an ex-girlfriend. Being ""real"" friends with an ex generally doesn't happen until you've been broken up for several years and the former relationship is a distant memory."
184,"Maybe she's scared and wants her mother there?   My mom explained that childbirth is one of those situations where you just want your mom.   Her mom gave birth to her and now she's giving birth.  You could be the best husband in the world, but you don't know anything about shoving a child out of your body and she wants her mom during this time- giving birth is scary!   

&amp;nbsp;

 *If that's how she really feels,*  that's a very emotional response and you might not be able to tell her she's wrong to feel that way.   Find out if she feels this way, and if so, maybe reevaluate your own feelings on her mom being there.  Think of it as supporting your wife.  Besides, the nurses there will be there to make sure no drama happens.  Giving birth is your wife's battlefield and she gets to pick her team.  This is not the ideal time to ask her to pick between the two of you."
185,we're not saying she should leave him over the sleep issue. We're saying she should leave him because he's being a selfish asshole over the sleep issue and she's been sleeping on an air mattress for six months while he sleeps in the brand new bed she bought. 
186,"jesus. i had to double check your age because you sound like a teenager.  you are too old to date a 20 year old.  you have nothing in common but a desire to fuck.  you knocked up this poor other woman.  time to put on your big boy pants, act like a responsible adult, and take care of your life.  you should absolutely never see the 20 year old again."
187,"This dude sounds like a complete loser and you deserve someone better who actually gives a shit about your feelings rather than prioritizing a video game waifu over you. He thinks your discomfort is funny, he's guilt-tripping you by sulking around like a kid who can't get a toy he wants when you express how upset you feel about this. He shows no signs of taking you seriously and stopping. This is not how a 24 year old should act in a healthy relationship, and I wouldn't be surprised if this isn't the only way he treats you poorly, based on the selfish and childish behavior you've mentioned. 

Liking video game characters or even having crushes on them is totally fine and normal, but this is not the case for him. He talks about this character near constantly and even forces weird fantasies on you when you're doing nice couple things like cuddling together, even though he knows you don't like it.
I'd say there's hope for him and your relationship if he had stopped this bullshit after you've told him how you feel, but he keeps going back to it no matter how many times you talk to him, effectively showing that this stupid obsession is more important to him than you. Your feelings don't actually matter to him, they're more of an obstacle to him, if anything.

He doesn't ""get"" how insecure it makes you feel, because he doesn't want to. He's comfortable with a lifestyle of infatuation with 2D characters who are idealized caricatures of what real humans are. You don't have to worry about being considerate or accounting for someone else's needs in a relationship when they're not real, after all. 

He's wasting your time, dump him and go date someone who puts you first and has an actual life outside of obsessing over a girl from a video game. This dude can have fun being single and jerking it to dorito girl while you find yourself a better relationship. "

189,"I don't think he's into you. I may be wrong but I used to be like your bf with my exes.

Basically, I was selfish and kind of a jerk to my ex bf. I'd get mad at every little thing and punish him for things outside of his control. Like basically the alarm thing. Any person who has a morsel of love for you is going to let this slide as long as it's not something that happens all the time. Maybe a little irked but definitely not silent treatment for hours kind of irked. It's cruel. I used to be that person so I know. I got some kind of kick out of watching him beg for forgiveness knowing that he won't leave me because he was so in love with me. Until one day he had had enough. Looking back and doing some soul searching, I realized that the more he catered toward me the less I respected him, until one day long long time ago, I stopped loving him. I still loved the comfort that he provided and companionship. But truly loving him as a person? No. You can't love someone you don't respect. 

Look at yourself. You're walking on eggshells. Is that healthy? Ask yourself seriously if you think this is normal. Chances are this isn't the only thing your bf gets mad about. You're bending over backward to appease him about waking up at 5am. Tell him to take an Advil and get over it if he's got a headache - like any adult would. If you keep following him around like he's better than you when he asked for space he's going to realize that you have no self dignity. You've said your apologies, if he can't forgive you over something that small, then he's the one with issues not you.

190,Do you have to live in your current city or town? Would a more diverse American city suit her better?
191,Ask your mom what she thinks and then if she's go bring it up with your step dad. It also might depend on what state you are in whether it's legal or not. In Ohio you can adopt an adult child for ease of inheritance or diminished capacity etc. but it varies by state.

193,"If you can afford it, I think a therapist visit occasionally would be great for you. It can give you that opportunity to be completely truthful and vent about what's going on in your life to a non-biased third party with no worry about hurting your partner in the process. 

Having no outlet isn't really healthy. I get why she's hurt, but you need to be able to at least talk about what's going on. "

195,"Wait, her problem is that you aren't married by now, i.e. in her view completely committed to each other, and her response to this is to have an emotional affair? She's clutching at straws here to turn herself into the injured party and not get any blame. 

If she genuinely stops talking to this guy, perhaps you can fix this, but it doesn't seem she's willing to accept that their relationship is inappropriate and devastating for you. It's callous, and I'm wondering if she's also in denial about her real problems in your relationship together. She's been with you since she was 18 - is it possible she wants to experience new people and relationships and perhaps just feels like she's 'missed out' on something by settling so young?

In any case, she's already said she would have taken things further with him if she had her way, and doesn't want to stop. She's willing to cheat on you, and hide this from you for months. It doesn't sound like she's happy to save your relationship, and I have to wonder if you're only hoping to save it because you have been together for so long and have been with her all your adult life. Yes, it's scary at first to be alone, but you deserve a happier relationship than this."

The OP's first responsibility is to herself and her children. If the addict refuses to seek help there is not much she can do for him. "
198,"What is it that bothers you so much?  That she is not a virgin?  That he is a jerk?  If you had the power to change the situation, what is it specifically that you would change?  Who she lost her virginity to?  The age that she lost it?  The way she lost it?  Or is it just the whole thing?"

But getting a lap dance from an absolute stranger is crossing a massive boundary. I know for a fact he wouldn't be happy if the same happened to you. 

It's like your boyfriend wants to act single whilst being in a relationship; he's basically an immature child who doesn't understand basic etiquette, and probably goes along with what his friends say. The fact that he told you months later suggests he knows in the back of his mind that you wouldn't be comfortable with it, which is a red flag. You can do a lot better, and you're being very mature about the situation too. Communicate with him, and see how he responds. There's a possible chance for forgiving him depending on his maturity and sympathy, but I doubt that would happen. "
205,Can you clarify something a bit: Does your sister already know your BiL wants to wait 5 years before having kids? Some of the comments are focusing on this but I thought that the fight they had was because he told her he wants to wait and she doesn't.  If he is being honest about his desired timeline I don't think there's any need for you to get involved. That's something they need to work out on their own. 
206,"&gt; she most likely had low self esteem and thought the only way to get OP to like her was for him to spend time with her.

How else to you get to like somebody?  I just don't see how this is indicative of low self-esteem. "

209,"Let's recap:

10 year age gap 

Alcohol abuse

Jealous/controlling of you spending time with someone else for no reason

Got drunk and didn't come home

Pouring water on someone to wake them up 

Made a fist and hit you

Screaming, public argument

.... literally nothing here to save."
210,"It would be like if he shot you in the foot *after* you stepped in dog poop. For your own good, of course."
211,"By not making mean comments like ""she's a busive for controlling who the family sees"" or ""she's a sweet girl even if she has a strong personality."" You've said them so casually here, I bet you make little digs like that in front of her and your son all the time, of course they want to spend time with her mother! They just had a baby, they don't have the emotional energy to deal with your passive aggressive bs right now.

Also, I like how you chose to move away, can't afford to visit, and blame them for not spending money to fly you out there. Again, THEY JUST HAD A BABY! They can't afford your airfare. I bet other grandma isn't asking them to pay for her travels."
212,"Yeah I love my family, but more than a week with anyone but my husband makes me crazy!"
213,"He has very real concerns about cat ownership. You do realize that while adoption is cheap, the care for a cat is expensive after that point? Why not focus on the non-money issues (cleaning your apartment and finding out if you're actually still allergic to them) before making this big decision. "
214,"&gt; but the more I think about it, the more I realize that his context for ""owning a pet"" was his parents, who basically did this exact thing but instead of getting rid of the animals, they just let them shit and piss everywhere and feed them human food more often than dog and cat food.

...gross. Yeah, it sounds like between that and your ex-friends abandoning their cat, he's got some hangups around pet ownership.

Do you think you and your husband could find the time to volunteer at a local animal shelter for an hour or two a week? Watching you help out with pets, clean up after them, etc might go a long way towards making him feel more comfortable. Also, there are foster cat programs, where you take care of a shelter cat for a period of time. The shelter pays for medications, special diets and vet visits, so your only cost is litter, food, and toys (and a nail clipper.) "
215,"His mom genuinely is amazing, I feel sorry for her - I would go for her. I know going will require a performance of a 'happy wife' and I feel sick. "

218,This is totally a therapy issue.
219,"&gt;  I realize what a selfish idiot I've been

So I think your question really is how can your ex believe that this won't happen again?

I'm not sure there is a good answer for you there, since she probably didn't think it could happen the first time.

Regardless of whether you get back with your ex, you need to focus on working on yourself and becoming more mature.  Why did you steal from your gf?  Why did you believe that you were entitled not to do your fair share in the relationship?  Why did you think that relationships weren't between equals?

&gt; I want to show her that I’m truly repentant and DIFFERENT 

Except that part of your problem is that you are rudderless and flip flop.  A sudden flip flop isn't going to be convincing to anybody that you've made a permanent positive change in your life.

You almost need to start courting her from square 1.  Work on developing yourself into the sort of person you think she would be proud of."
220,"You know you're being a terrible partner, right? 
You need to come clean to the cops and apologize to your girlfriend. Jesus Christ."
221,"He said he still wants to see you so maybe, but you need to cool off on the texts and wait for him to text you. Stop texting him and focus on other things. You've reached a level of texting that is truly cringe worthy and he has told you in no uncertain terms that it is freaking him out and you need to stop."
222,Uninvite them. They cant announce shit if they arent there.
223,"Your husband needs intense psychological intervention here, and maybe even psychiatric. He would benefit from a stay at a treatment center that specializes in extreme mental/emotional problems of this sort. Your husband very well may have a mental/brain illness such as paranoid schizophrenia, or a personality issue such as borderline personality disorder. It may not even be either at all, but whatever is wrong with him will only escalate and while you are the focus of his obsession/delusion, you and your children are in *danger*. 

If you stay, you need to make it a condition of the marriage continuing that he seek treatment immediately. Eventually you guys should seek marital counseling together but that needs to be way on the back burner, what you should focus on right now is his treatment. There is no treatment or counseling you can do together while he is an active abuser and while he is mentally trapped in his paranoid delusions of which you are the target. It is possible that he can change, but he cannot do it on his own and there is nothing you can do, as the person his delusion is focused on, to break the cycle. He has to seek professional help.

You need to tell both sides of the family, yours and his, what is going on. If you guys have living folks, both sets of parents urging him to get help will have an impact, especially his. Tell your friends. Have an escape plan. Honestly if I were you I would be gone today with the kids, but I have been through this before and I know how quickly this can become a life and death situation. He hasn't hit you yet, but checking your underwear, clocking your travel time to and from places, not trusting you to go/be alone anywhere, not to mention crafting an entire delusional cheating back-story off of gum in the foyer...well all those signs indicate that he has lost his entire mind and feels extremely hurt, victimized, and chaotic inside. To calm those feelings he has to lash out at you, and each cycle the feelings escalate and thus the lashings escalate. It's only going to get worse and worse until maybe even a maiming or death situation. I don't mean to frighten you or wish any ill on your marriage or life, but you must understand how serious this is for you and your children. 

If not for yourself please think of your children."
224,"This is the first thing that came to mind too. He is either projecting because he, himself is cheating or he is mentally very unwell. In either case, his controlling, jealous, and abusive behavior will destroy their marriage. 

OP, please seek counseling for yourself. I would also get an STD panel. "
225,"He sounds like he has dangerously low self-control. You should definitely leave someone who can hit you and tell you not to ""defy"" him with no remorse. Listen to yourself...he's caused potentially *permanent* damage to your jaw. There were a hundred other ways he could've handled the situation, but he chose the one way that would cause you physical and mental injury. That's awful. Not the actions of a good man.

PS, You should get your jaw checked out, if you haven't already. And probably you should talk to the police, so that you can have a police report when you try to divorce him. "

227,"If you can't get therapy you should learn as much as you can about the cycle of abuse, why abuse victims go on to become abusers, controlling your anger, healthy expressions of anger, etc etc using books or YouTube or the Internet.

228,"Do you really think your sister, who you've given a home out of kindness, who just made out with your husband, is going to demand 30 days formal notice?

229,Claire leveled up so you're just the opposite of a consolation prize. 
230,"For some brides, the wedding planning is so intense that there is no fade-out, just a sudden bump back to reality. You spend a year being treated like the most important person on earth, with everyone fussing over you and asking about the wedding planning, and every weekend and free hour is spent consulting with florists and catererers, and every single vendor is fussing over you because they want your business, and then you're the centre of attention at the wedding...and then overnight, the wedding is over. People stop treating you like a fairy princess. People move on with their lives. You have no big project to work on, no Big Day to look forward to. It's all over and you're back to boring old reality. There's a honeymoon, but mostly there's sending out thank-you notes and dealing with excess wedding decor, which isn't as glamorous as being pampered. Or maybe your magical day wasn't quite as magical as you had hoped, and now you have nothing to show for it except a mountain of debts. 

This is definitely not a universal phenomena that affects every woman, but I have heard of it happening. "

235,"No that's cool, I'm just saying it's not like they were in a relationship and he can claim you broke them up. I think you did the right thing. The fact that he's a closet case and only dates women to ""front"" is terrible on its own. He's just callously using these women as cover, the potential for a genuine relationship was never there. Also the way he reacted seems to indicate he had no intention of telling her he has HIV and in my view that's something you're morally obligated to disclose to a potential sexual partner (the legal situation depends where you are). Your friend isn't a good guy and I think you were justified protecting someone from him both physically and emotionally)"
236,"I just read your update and some comments posted after mine. Just reading that he started laughing at you for crying made my heart go out to you. The fact that he's trying to break into your devices made my blood run cold. I'm relieved that you can see this for the emotional abuse it is. 

What is your living situation, legally? Are you both on the lease? 

In your shoes, I would start calling everyone I trusted to tell them that I was trying to break up with my abusive boyfriend and he was refusing to leave. That he was trying to control all my communications and deprive me of sleep and I was really upset and frightened because he was acting insane and destructive. These things are all true. Keep saying them to people you trust until someone offers to help you. If no one is in a position to help you, call your local crisis line and see what resources are available to you. People who work on crisis lines know that abuse is not just getting punched in the face, that monitoring and control also constitute debilitating abuse.

I'm so sorry this is happening to you. "
237,"""my boyfriend is abusive and controlling, i don't want to leave him i want him to CHANGE!"""
238,"Um, this is a HUGE deal. You need to contact the potential landlord NOW, either via E-mail or whatever and save those text messages (take screenshots) and literally tell them that your soon-to-be ex-boyfriend has applied for an apartment with you as a leaseholder and your one-year-old son without your consent or knowledge and you are NOT interested in the apartment and you'll be seeking legal counsel A.S.A.P.!

I'd probably also head over to r/legaladvice and ask them perhaps what you can do besides talking to a lawyer. 

Seriously, stop trying to make a relationship work with this guy, he keeps showing you who he is, that he's unreliable and has no care if he leaves you high-and-dry."
239,"You're not being abusive. Sometimes it's necessary to raise one's voice to be heard! Her reaction to this? Bringing her mother into the matter? She can break up with you on her own. Maybe you should reconsider this relationship. She obviously lacks the maturity to be in one.

As for the tickets? You had an arrangement. If they refuse to honor the terms, or change the terms at the drop of a hat, back out. Unless you had something in writing it's one word against another. If you do decide to continue, at the very least see proofs of purchase, reservations, receipts or some record before forking any money over."
240,"I think your bf is being smart. Even if married there's one person who is the primary owner usually, bought the pet and is listed on vet forms, which is a good thing if the couple splits. 

I'm looking at adopting another kitten. The kitten would be everyone's pet but I would be the owner. Doesn't mean others can't love/enjoy the kitten. 

I think this is really about you and your bf. It sounds like you are worried he isn't fully committed or going to commit to you. Also why are you getting friends and roommates to weigh in on opinions about your relationship? That can cause issues down the line with friends/family giving opinions."
241,"There's a lot in this post that sounds like what happened to my friend when she had a full breakdown with borderline personality disorder.

You need to protect yourself. If you can't block her number, change your own number. Do not engage with her. Seek legal protection if necessary.

Warn your employer that your sister has a mental health issue and that she is making threats of interfering with your job.

If there is a safe way you can get her help, do it, but your first priority is to stay safe."
242,You have to realize that being forced to promise things like that reeks of deep down insecurities and worries. 
243,"As much as you want her gone, it's better than having to deal with your conscience if anything happened. In the morning, the train is her problem to deal with. Let her friends or family deal with it.

I'm just telling the guy, be prepared. Like, mentally prepare yourself for the jokes about ""fucking a dude"" or ""being gay"" or whatever. Best case scenario, it never happens. But yeah, planning for the best isn't exactly a winning strategy."
247,"There is a right and wrong way to debate. She's doing it the wrong way. Quite frankly, a lot of people who cherrypick at things like phrasing are the ones who depend on their ""opponent"" making mistakes because they know their own argument isn't strong enough to stand on its own. The food stamp thing is only true if she planned to have ramen every single day, and the overall pretentious demeanour is a scare tactic used to get you (and others) to question your beliefs and refrain from challenging her. A true intellectual doesn't seek to be the smartest person in the room because that implies they have no room to grow, she's all bravado and little substance.

You can disagree with your partner politically if you're able to respect your differences and maintain your individual perspectives/lifestyles without tearing each other down. I lean more right, a lot of my past friends/partners have leaned left. We didn't let it affect our relationship. This girl seems to get off on making you feel dumb, which isn't something that can happen in a healthy relationship. I'd break it off, because this is who she is as a person and isn't likely to change. If anything, you leaving will simply lead to her assuming ""you couldn't keep up with her."""

250,"Oi vey.

If you're really that traumatized, seek counselling.

252,"
This behavior isn't ok.  And you need to have a serious talk with him.  
You are the driver and the driver makes the rules.  The driver makes the rules because if an accident happens the driver can be held responsible and have to deal with all the repercussions (points on license, increased insurance costs, loss of car etc).  Your boyfriend was putting you all in danger by being a jerk to do what...impress his brother?  
Him being condescending was just the cherry on top of this shit sundae.  
Also, stop for gas any time you want.  Heck stop at a rest area or mom and pop store too.  It doesn't hurt to stop driving, rest your eyes, stretch and use a restroom on a longer drive.  It's also possible that with city or holiday driving you could find yourself stuck in traffic which will burn through fuel or make it so you can't get to a gas station when you're on empty.  "

254,"What kind of supports do you have where you're living now? Friends? Family? Hobby-groups? Book-clubs? Gym membership? Yoga class?

&gt;I'm starting to resent him because I feel like my health and happiness don't really matter to him. 

Who is primarily responsible for your health &amp; happiness? Is your husband as responsible, less responsible, or more responsible for these things than you are? 

I have to ask because most of the things your husband can do are supportive, while most of the things you can do are active. Finding a job that gives you a sense of meaning or purpose isn't something anyone else can do except you. Building a circle of friends whose company you enjoy and who inspire you to grow and be fulfilled isn't something your husband can do for you. Your husband can pay for the spin classes or buy wine &amp; cheese for the book club meetings, but you're the one that has to sign up and find the things that feel good for you.

So I have ask the first, most basic question:

&gt;About 6 months after moving here (Fall 2015), I realized I didn't really like living in this city

Why? What is it about this specific city that you don't like? Is it that you need a second car and you only have one? Is it that you don't have a large circle of friends? Is it that you haven't found a good sushi bar/jazz club/independent book store where you feel at home? 

EDIT: I see you posted something in reply to another comment: "" I feel like both of those issues could have been avoided if I lived somewhere else. I no longer want to go outside."" Rabies shots suck on ice. Antibiotic resistant infections are straight-up scary. But here's the part where things get weird: both of those things are pretty rare events, and both are in the past. It seems weird to both a.) associate those things with a specific city rather than seeing them as risks that exist anywhere you live and b.) believe that because two rare negative events happened to you, more rare risks are likely to happen. 

Losing a job sucks. Being in a city where you don't have a lot of connections, and then losing the one semi-social connection you had (your job) can leave you feeling really isolated and alone. When you say you're unhappy, **I believe you!** 

What I'd like you to think about, what I'd like you to explore by writing lists or clipping listings out of the classifieds from your local free weekly paper, is ""what kinds of things are you willing to try that might make you feel a little happy?"" Because right now, what you've posted is ""I am unhappy in city X and I will be happy in city Y"", and well... that's not necessarily true. What were the things in your prior city that helped make you happy, and how many of those things could be echoed where you are now? 

I'm concerned at how much time &amp; attention you have invested in 'how I am unhappy in this city'. You're not leaving the house to try a new coffee shop for a few hours, or to walk through an off-leash dog-park, or to try an urban food cart. You're only leaving the house to get medical treatment, which feeds back into this ""I only see this city when I'm unhappy"" cycle. "
255,"No, I think in the first paragraph it says that they divorced..."
256,"Gee, I can see why you're friends with her. 

Apparently petting sick kittens or whatever means you get a free pass to fuck married men for presents and lulz. I hope she explained that to their wives, I'm sure they'll suddenly be fine with the whole thing. Oh and their kids should know too, she should definitely explain that it's fine to sleep with their dads as long as she donates to charity, since that cancels it out! They'll understand I'm sure. "
257,"I'll be honest, I've seen this behavior before from people who drink less frequently than their partners. One either doesn't drink or only has a little once a month or so, and the other may drink either several times a week or have a glass a night, or whatever. I've seen this conversation take place, but this situation is weird because he skipped, like, three steps. 

He should have had several conversations before now about your alcohol consumption if it bothered him so much. He could have even said things like ""Hey, let's have a sober weekend"" or whatever. Instead, he jumps straight to demands and ultimatums. It makes me wonder if someone (one of his parents, maybe?) got in his head and convinced him that you have a problem and he needs to confront you. If it's this out of the blue, something just doesn't add up. "
258,"OP already said the baby has stomach issues with a bottle, and lots of new moms can't, with a day notice, pump enough for a couple feedings anyway."
259,because he actually gave a fuck about you. that's what's missing for poor OP.
260,"That's not a bad reason f you define good reason as ""it helps you communicate"". In this case it helps you communicate you are trendy."
261,"So you were walking along, tripped and landed lip to lip with the guy?  Wow.  That would be accidentally kissing someone.

Instead, you were hanging with a guy who kept making passes at you.  You enjoyed the attention - most women would.  But now you see the danger of putting yourself in that situation.  

That being said, don't beat yourself up over 5 seconds of your life.  The real issue was keeping yourself in that situation where someone was trying to kiss you.  That was much more than 5 seconds.

Even so, learn the lesson to shut someone down completely in the future so that you don't have to feel this guilt.  I would ""confess"" myself in this case, but that is up to you.  For some, a kiss of even 5 seconds is cheating.  For others, it is a momentary lapse in judgement.  I can't make that decision for you.  "
262,"If she happened to have had sex with the young man and not known he was a student in her school district it is different than knowingly engaging in sex with a student.

He was 18 and therefore an adult. It's not bending over backwards. If she wasn't a teacher in the same district there would have been nothing wrong with her having sex with another adult."
263,You're assuming they have one.
264,"Unfortunately, this is a real thing for some people. My (31F) father (73) has always been my idol, just like OP says of her dad. He was a diehard democrat my whole childhood, but, not long after President Obama was elected, he started changing. He had recently retired at the time so he had all sorts of free time that he never had before, and started listening to more conservative radio while he worked around in the backyard and Fox on the tv when he was inside. Now I can barley stand to have a conversation with him about anything. And he's angry all the time from pain and life in general. "
265,"&gt;I never thought my dad would be the type of man to think women devalue with age but his dating profile says another story.

It really hurts to discover these things. The best thing is to NOT interfere in his dating profile (his life, his way, his business), but to absolutely to make distance for yourself. Give yourself some time.

If you guys are close enough, and if after some time (a couple of months) you still want that closeness, you can tell him how much it upset you to help him write his profile and to see him take such an *unbalanced* approach to women- that it makes you question your worth to him, and how he sees you (if that is the truth of it).

He likely won't react well or how you would want him too. So just be prepared for that. Be prepared that this new knowledge of him will just dovetail with the natural distancing from parents that occurs in your early twenties. Don't fret about it. It is pretty normal and will be ok. "
266,"Well, it makes sense given the mindset they grew up with and live in.

- Gay people don't ""exist"", they are just confused/have a disgusting habit. 
- Gender doesn't exist, only sex, so Transexual*s* don't ""exist"", they are just confused 
- Men should only fuck women
- Transmen are women
- Men who fuck transmen are not gay
- Since Transmen are women, you can treat them like shit, as you do with all women.

See? Totally reasonable once you accept their preposition.

The sad thing is that there is so little communication/education, that these people do not understand Queer/Trans issues."
267,"Yeah. And in my experience everyone who has said their SO is ""abusive and manipulative"" as a way of justifying their affair, they really mean ""my spouse wants me to invest time, effort, energy and love into our committed relationship and is not okay with me pouring all of the above into somebody else"".

Seriously, if his relationship were truly abusive, he should be looking into making a clean break, not dragging OP into his train wreck of a life."
268,"&gt; Are you seriously 29 years old? The maturity you've displayed in this post makes you look like a teenager.

Well, she's been carrying on a crush with this guy since she was 14, so it makes sense that she's got the emotional maturity of a high school freshman. "
269,"you are not weak. Weakness would be to ignore the problem. You are aware of the problem. You want a solution that's good for you. This shows that you have a good head on your shoulders and that you think clearly.

Your heart will hurt, of course. But this is only temporary. The process is to go through shock and realization, then grief, and then healing. So, you'll reach healing eventually, you know this. For now, let your heart be sad or angry, as it is only normal, but your resolve should be strong, as you know where you are headed. 

In fact, one could say that it is necessary for you to go through all of those steps in order to get over this  relationship that's not going to work out, so that you may regain your independence and happiness, and eventually meet the partner who'll really be right for you. You'll be in a better position soon enough to find happiness in life. Maybe knowing this brings you some comfort. "

274,"First, you may not be able to continue being friends with them. You can still be friendly, even hang out with them, but understand that you are their boss.

Second. Be firm. Maintain boundaries, and don't let things slide. The trick is to be fair and to chastise people without embarrassing them. Hold them accountable, but don't humiliate. Also, go them for idea on how you could be doing your job better, but more importantly, how the team can improve. Don't be afraid to show appreciation for a job well done.

Do not micromanage.

Do not be afraid of coming off as bossy. You are the boss. That means that if/when challenged, what you say is the last word. Own it. If you have that confidence, but are willing to be fair and open with your team, most of the time, you won't have to be bossy."

But no... a fucking mobile phone game. I wouldn't even let my spouse look me in the eyes until I had divorce papers signed.... no fucking way. That's so embarrassing. What could he have been buying? 7.5k worth of ""daily tries""? I don't get it."

290,Your boyfriend lacks empathy and respect for you.  I would be furious.  
291,"&gt;I think I'm trying to figure out a way to not do what I know I need to. 

Why? Seriously...think about why you aren't leaving. If your sister or friend or a complete stranger told you this story you'd tell them to pack a bag. 

I'm going to take a guess at why. 

At some point you fell in ""love"" with this person. So you have an image of them. Part of you thinks if x,y,z changed they would snap back into being the image of them you had when you fell in ""love"" you believe that person is real and this other person is some mistake, some error that can be fixed. 

The reality is, this person. This person who gets upset over laundry baskets and the order things are cooked in and 3 bobby pins, this is who your boyfriend is, in reality. This is it. If he wanted to be a different person he'd wouldn't be doing these things. Accept his true self. The person you ""love"" isn't real. He's a made up version that only exists in your imagination. Based on who you thought your boyfriend was way back when you first started dating and he was on his best behavior. 

are you staying because you don't want to hurt him or are you staying because you don't know how or are scared to leave?

Are you staying because even though this is crummy and miserable you're holding on to the illusion someone loves you and the illusion of love is more important to you than your actual well being?

Everyday you spend with him you are robbing both of you of the chance to find other people. People who can love you for your true selves. "
292,"""I couldn't just leave the guys!"" So if they got hookers, would you go along? If they bought some meth, would you have smoked it? Peer pressure as an excuse is never valid.

302,"She didn't drug you to question you about items you set boundaries on previously before the occurrence. You're making a big deal out of a small moment where she was (slightly) opportunistic and used the situation to her advantage to fulfill her curiosity. Be cautious around her when your guard is down, but this isn't news to you since you've known her a long time.

You're overreacting. Let it go. Calling it unethical/completely crossing the lines/grounds to not see this woman is in my opinion, totally playing a victim."
303,"He liked the idea of having a legacy, 'someone to carry on his name' blah blah blah and the other things people romanticize about parenthood - and maybe he liked the ego boost about having knocked someone up as well to prove virility - but then reality set in and he doesn't actually want to be a father."
304,"You might need counseling to help you establish a 'new normal'. What I think you should keep in mind is that your treatment seems to have made drastic changes in your motivation and involvement in the home, and she's still reacting / adjusting to this change. 

This stuck out at me: 
&gt; I began taking on other areas of life. These were responsibilities my wife had kept up – things like managing a budget, organizing the kitchen, shopping for groceries, buying clothes for the kids, creating a chore list, and so on. 

and 

&gt; As far as feeling “trapped,” I’m responsible for most of the house chores at this point. Cleaning the dishes, taking out the trash, cleaning and folding the laundry, mowing, cooking, vacuuming, budgeting, paying bills, taking care of our dogs, dusting, cleaning surfaces, cleaning the back porch, getting at least two kids to sleep, cleaning spills on the carpet… 9 times out of 10 I’m the responsible party. 

So....you stepped it up in an extreme way, taking responsibility for most chores around the house, and are now annoyed that you are responsible for most of the chores around the house. I see that your main motivation was to make up for all the time she shouldered the burden but you can probably see why, esp in light of your having gone overboard with the chores at times (turning grocery lists into involved tracking systems), she feels displaced and perhaps like she can't do it right. Additionally, she wants time with you and you are feeling so overwhelmed by the pending chores, you routinely prioritize those over her. 

There is honestly too much here to be able to solve via reddit. Clearly your perspective is that she's doing pretty much nothing in terms of housework, cooking, pulling her own and maybe even parenting, and you need to find a way for you both to have more balance. Between that and the budgetary concerns, resentment over her going out with friends when you haven't had the chance to, and her pointing to a potential OCD diagnosis, I absolutely think you need to find a way to get yourselves to therapy.

315,"Your boyfriend is totally and completely off base, and it's a red flag for worse behavior going forward. 

The other major red flag is how you are already considering yourself selfish and a bad partner, when you can tell by the responses so far you aren't even close. He has likely subtly and slowly shifted the goalposts on you in lots of ways so you no longer have a reliable sense of what a good and healthy partnership looks like. This is going to start affecting you in all sorts of areas, not just this question. If you are not familiar with truly abusive relationships, it's hard to understand why people stay in them. One of the main reasons is because they can no longer see or judge their relationship clearly. I hope that you can see by the responses in this thread that you are beginning to see your relationship through tinted glasses. It's likely only going to get worse from here. 

Just to contrast, this is what this these discussions would look like in a healthy relationship 

1. You get engaged. 
2. You jointly discuss how much you are going to combine finances. If needed (especially if your plan is to mostly keep things separate), you sign a prenup. 
3. You discuss and jointly agree to long term goals (type of house you want, location, whether or not in laws are there, etc.)
4 Once you have your agreed to goals, you figure out how much it will cost
5 You figure out the most equitable and financially sound way of getting there. Which current properties do you sell? Which do you keep and rent out? What bank account does future rent go in? Do in law pay rent? If it's a healthy relationship so far, these questions are more about what's the best investment strategy than anything else, and the decision should involve spreadsheets. "
316,"No way on this earth should you do that! 

I'd like to hear what the rest of your relationship is really like, because I highly doubt this is the only instance of him telling you one thing and the truth being the polar opposite. 
Or maybe this is just him beginning to take control of your life. If this is him baby-stepping to control, I'd hate to see what his grand finale would be.

What is his reasoning for keeping his condos and not contributing to the down payment of this future house, while making FOUR times the income you make? 
Girl, you need to run screaming like a liquored-up banshee. 
Trust me, this man does not have you or your future children's best interest at heart.

Edit: Looking at his ridiculous financial requests,  I'm wondering if he actually does own 2 condos. 
You say you have been transparent with him, has he been the same to you? 
Because this is sounding like someone who might be drowning financially and is looking for a way out. You've obviously got a good head on your shoulders and are very responsible when it comes to money.

I could be completely wrong on that, but you might want to look into that if you aren't sure.

OP, there is not ONE SINGLE THING you can do to improve the situation.  Because he is making this choice.  And yes, it IS a choice.  He chooses to offload his anger on to you, even though he knows your history, even though he knows it hurts and scares you.  He KNOWS this, and he chooses to hurt you.

Manipulation. Good response.

&gt; he said that he was tired of hearing me complain about it so he was buying me a safe.

Gaslighting - one example of making you think you were losing your mind for 2.5 years.

&gt; last night he asked me if I could just not tell any of our friends or family about all of this

Isolating you and protecting himself.

&gt; He said, ""Are you serious? Yes I screwed up. But everything is still the same. I love you so much. I messed up big time."" Then he asked if I'm wanting a divorce and I said that I don't know what to do right now. He said said, ""Wow.""

Minimizing/blame-shifting (making you the bad guy).

&gt; I still don't feel like he even thinks this is that bad. He keeps adamantly saying that this is the only thing that he has lied to me about. He said to me, ""The only thing that has been a lie is this one area. It's in the light now.""

Minimizing. It's not ""in the light"" until every other leader at the church knows and takes appropriate action.

&gt; I want to be the honest person that I am, but I also feel like I need to be loyal to my husband.

There's no conflict here. Loyalty doesn't mean covering up criminal activity or protecting his reputation (aka ego), and an addict should not be a pastor. If your church doesn't take your side, they're enabling sin and you should find one that actually follows the Bible. 

&gt; I don't even know how I would handle a separation, logistically. It would disrupt every area of our lives. My family is states away and I can't afford our place on my own. He makes more money than I do.

It's really hard, I know, and I'm sorry your husband ruined your marriage. It's not your fault, and you can't fix him. All you can do is get support (friends + counselor), separate from him, and set firm, consistent boundaries/consequences. Make sure you use words like ""drug addict"", ""stealing amphetamines"", and ""manipulation/gaslighting"" when telling others - **do not** minimize what he's done, and **do not** go back until he's had counseling​, he's sincerely repentant, the church leadership knows, and they've taken appropriate action.

You've dealt with an addict before. You can do this, even though it feels overwhelming and impossible. PM me if you need support. ❤️ "

349,"I imagine he tried to file a police report because that's what the rental company said they needed from him. If the cop bothered to fill one out that involved you, you should have gotten a copy of it.

Source: I honked my horn at a lady who didn't go when the light turned green, and this made her lose her entire mind. When I didn't pull over to fight her, or whatever, she called the cops and said I hit her car and drove off. Cops had to investigate, but didn't buy it and were also very cool about things. They filed a report indicating a complaint was made but no damages were found and no one was considered at-fault. Nothing else ever came from it.  "

355,"You have two options.

1. Stay, and lose any self-esteem you have by marrying someone who works to convince you that you are worthless. This will escalate, and it will be harder to leave as you come to believe more and more that you aren't worthy of respect or love from anyone - not to mention it's way harder to leave when you actually have to get a lawyer and pay to get a divorce.

2. Make the decision to walk away, when he asks why keep it short - ""Because I deserve better."" Don't even get into a big argument about it; there's no point unless you want to listen to him try to convince you that it's okay for your SO to tell you that you are a disgusting loser. Temporarily feel like crap about the breakup - but eventually you'll be proud of yourself for it, and end up really happy either in a relationship where love is intertwined with mutual respect - or end up happy not even in a relationship. Either is fine!

The only reasonable response is the roommate acting like a god damn adult and discussing a change in rent with OP.

Also it sounds like OP's housemate is weakly justifying herself with ""you said I could use it"", in which case OP should just go ""great! I'm taking it back now"" and shut down further discussions of it. I really doubt OP's housemate would have done this had she not been away for a month, so so long as OP has no further plans of leaving the room unattended for an extended duration, she shouldn't have any further problems.

She kept touching me and grabbed my ass. She was pretty hot too, but I told her no way because I love you!' is kinda gross to be honest and just sounds like you want a pat on the back and that the whole thing was a bit of an ego boost. Now, to be fair, it *can* be an ego boost, even if you react in the totally right way, and that's all right. Taking that feeling and kinda showing it to your girlfriend like a cat that just killed a lizard is less okay in many monogamous relationships.

What my grandfather did was even worse.

He ended up dropping out of school thanks to them, developed PTSD, anxiety, depression - and he also had schizophrenia. Got into two accidents while working, leaving him disabled.

394,"Well firstly, your BF is incredibly stupid and really not very observant.  You've been dating 4 years, you lived together for two years - and he just now worked out birth control.  The thing you take every single day.  The thing that, unless you skip the placebo, means you have a period once a month - a thing I'd hope he would notice.

Wow.  That's some level of obliviousness and frankly, in my opinion, evidence of him truly not caring much about something that's extremely important to you.

Secondly, you've been dating four years and he blows up at you, refuses to believe what you're saying (even when showing you proof) and brings up ""SPERMJACKING"" (wtf) instead of say, trusting the woman he's been with for almost half a decade.

On top of which he obviously trusts his friends more than he trusts you and you know, all the scientific references you had.

OP, I'd say your instinct is right - skip the hike, take some time to work out how you feel about your boyfriend being this stupid and oblivious and not trusting you over his friend and other stupid people on the internet (we all know exactly where he got the ""spermjacking"" phrase from).

For me, this would be a pretty good indication that BF isn't the guy I thought he was and I'd be seriously considering dumping him.  I mean, seriously, he accused you of ""spermjacking"" - that implies a lot of what he thinks of your ethics, morals and approach to life.  "

401,"A while ago my SO said he'd like to start eating me out again (we haven't done that in over a year- I normally go down on his for 15-20 minutes before we fuck bc I enjoy it).


Last night I put a vaginal contraceptive strip in (kind of like a spermacidal breath strip for your lady bits).  I asked him to go down on me and he said ""I would, but like, you have a strip in,"" which I was absolutely mortified about. I haven't asked him to do this because I always feel like I'd taste bad. 


He winds up shrugging, does it anyway and is at it for roughly ten minutes before I say that I'm getting close. Another minute goes by and I still haven't finished when he pops up and says really aggressively ""Look, just tell me what you want. What do I have to do."" 


I was so completely taken out to the moment so I say to just fuck med- meanwhile he's gone completely soft. Mind you, he *says* that he really enjoys going down on me, so that was disheartening too. He gets back to it really roughly and I just pull him up and blow him until he's hard so he can fuck me and get it over with. 



In the shower afterward he kept asking ""What do you want? Was I not patient enough? What do you need?"" Which would be really nice... if he didn't sound so annoyed. I definitely won't be asking for this *ever* again. I've never been so self conscious or ashamed about sex before, and I've been in literal orgies.


So /r/relationships, how do I bring this up? Do I even bother to bring it up? Normally our sex life is so great, I've never had to deal with this with him before.

402,"Does the beanbag have a smell or stain on it?

It would definitely be your responsibility to replace it if so. But if you were lucky enough to be able to clean it so well that you can't even tell a rat died underneath it, I think it would be unreasonable for her to ask. If it's clean, I would tell her in a casual way and not make it into a huge deal - because if you found it, cleaned it up, and she doesn't have to deal with it, it's really not.

""So I was cleaning the other day and I found a rat that [cat] caught a while ago...eww! I cleaned everything up but I just wanted to let you know so maybe we can make sure to check under furniture more carefully - I thought she was only leaving them in the front hall. Sorry it took a while to catch it!""

Don't phrase it in a way that leaves it open to her demanding a new one; instead, phrase it in a way that suggests the topic is closed, you solved the problem, you're just keeping her informed.

I'm going to repeat though, this is only if the beanbag is *so* clean that you could never tell this happened. If there's any stain or smell at all, your responsibility is to tell her what happened, show her the damage, ask what she wants to do, and cover it. If you don't want to do that, maybe you shouldn't own a pet!"

406,"&gt; I don't consider it invasive, as we have always been a very close family. I don't think this is ""good for him"" and maybe his wife is isolating him. I am worried.

You sound like a textbook case of 'JNMIL' material, especially here. It's short for 'Just No Mother in Law'. It's a place where people go to vent stories about their invasive/clueless/dramatic/entitled mothers and mother in laws.

That bit about assuming his *wife*, mother of his newborn *child* is isolating him from you, especially when you talk to him literally every day on the phone is ridiculous. If he is getting some space from you, it is because **he** wants to have space from you.

If you talk to him every day, and he's your 'rock' (which is really just weird and unfair for him!), then if you two had a good relationship full of openness and mutual respect, he would be sending you photos naturally. He is not. This is a symptom.

I bet you stress him the fuck out, and he already has enough to worry about. I bet he loves you, but feels dread when those daily phone calls come. I bet he tries to just get through them as best he can, and because he is just weathering them instead of enjoying them, he is not engaged in them and so the thought of sending you happy photos doesn't come up.

I bet that you do a lot of talking about yourself and your problems in those phone calls. I bet that not a lot of support and focus is put on him, his daughter, his wife, and their needs."

- Probably didn't feel bad about it until she was caught.  

- Put you at risk of getting an STD.

She lied to you and denied when confronted.

- If this never happened, you would've never known. 

- Can't be sure if what you know is actually even the truth and could be worse.

To play devil's advocate, let's just say that what she did was a genuine mistake (unlikely) and there is a future.

- Can you trust her again to not cheat?

- Would it not bother you forever?

When people make a mistake and cheat they generally feel pretty bad about it.  But what she did was cheat on you at least 4 months of your 12 month relationship and showed a general callousness about the whole thing.  Didn't feel bad about it only until and because she was caught.

The only way I think cheating is MAYBE forgivable is when the cheater owns up to it quick.  By their own admission.  Getting caught, and cheating for a long time, then feeling bad is a deal breaker IMO."
421,"This is the type of thing you NEED to tell people about.

You should immediately inform people about what he said. If you're living with your parents, tell them immediately. If you know his parents, contact them. If he is in school anywhere, contact student services about the situation. Call the police non-emergency line and explain the situation, and see what they would suggest you do.

Of course you won't force her, because then you would go to jail. But saying ""if you don't have a major surgery that is none of my business and doctors probably won't even do it anyway, i will stand by and watch as my niece is put into the foster system"" is horrible. I agree with your wife, you do sound evil.

And why would you ask for inheritance money and not some financial help right now? If you are worried about the financial risk of raising your niece, how the hell is inheritance money going to help you? Your parents-in-law are still alive. Unless you just want to take the money in order to punish your sister in law? Which just adds to the evidence that you are a disney villain who somehow slipped into our time stream."
423,"You probably want to keep in mind that at this point, he might not come back. ""Dad's been sick for a long time.

424,"I have mentally ill people in my family and I see what you say (and the poster above you). But you are literally giving EVERY single psycho an out here.

I mean, I'm sure she didn't advertise she hates her baby or is beating on it as she knows those are feelings ""not to be had"". So there must have been some kind of knowledge that something is not going alright. 

So I see what you say, I do. I want everyone with a mental illness to get tons of help and I know that's not what happens, but it's hard for me to see that as a valid explanation if there was a little soul that was beaten so severely it nearly died. And I don't think that should be a valid excuse and acceptable. somewhere while raising that child to toddler age she must have known she can not care for it. I'm sure she didn't like the potential consequences that came with getting help (having the child removed?), but it'd had been better for it. 
Plus we really don't know if that's what happened or she just likes to beat on people weaker than her. "

There's a *significantly* increased risk of problems at that point for her. By 40 your risk of a miscarriage can climb as high as 50% and the odds of even *getting* pregnant without medical intervention have dropped to 36%.

440,"Most modern-day laws actually make a lot of sense. Those are called ""attractive nuisance"" laws (which is like, the best term ever). If you *assume* that it makes sense and then try to figure out what would be fair, you can usually reverse-engineer the confines of the law. 

Here's the Wikipedia layman's version of the requirements for liability:

* The landowner knows children are around who might trespass.

* The landowner knows children will be at risk of injury if they trespass.

* That children are too young to recognize the risk.

* The landowner can fix the problem at a reasonable cost.
The landowner does nothing.

Imagine you live in a neighborhood and you have a rambunctious three year old, and then a new neighbor moves in and places a super dangerous pool twenty feet from your yard with no fence. Suddenly, you're constantly terrified, right? If your kid slips away from you for even a minute, he can drown. And not only CAN, but he WANTS to, because he loves pools and he's too young to realize the danger. Is it fair for you to have to pay $600 for a fence because your *neighbor* built a pool? And if you don't have $600, and you just have to watch your kid like a hawk—let's say one day your other kid hurts herself badly, and while you're tending to her, your toddler runs next door and drowns. Would your neighbor's ""well, we never gave him permission to swim!"" defense feel fair? It's a blameless situation, but so easily prevented. 

The idea is that when someone does something (builds a pool) that creates negative externalities (the possibility of harm to kids who don't know better), the law should align incentives by pushing preventive costs onto the person creating the danger. 

You can totally disagree with it as policy, but it's not shocking, in context. "

Tell her you experienced a trigger which resulted in you going under the radar for awhile to put yourself back together.

Anyone who stays at home with young kids is working.  And I think there is a balancing act of how much the working spouse contributes.

So I can get why she doesn't really like that your girlfriend is still somewhere in the picture even if its just in the background.

However, I do tell stories and just use the word 'friend' in lieu of 'ex'. I don't brag to current boyfriends about anything ex related (unless it's said boyfriend's kink or something).

Ummm....sorry but what? This sounds kind of extreme.  Does Sara share her finance's political views?  It's perfectly fine for them to be conservative *as long as* they still listen to other perspectives and are willing to meet and socialize with people of other viewpoints. He sounds kind of cult-y and weird.

Do her parents like him and approve of the marriage? Are they eloping? Do they have any other friends or family you'd feel comfortable voicing your concerns to? 

22 is still quite young.  If she really wants to do this, that's totally her choice, but kids are permanent.  She need to seriously consider if she really wants a family at this age and how they'll be able to support a family on only one income if she's not working.  I'd try to sit her down alone, and talk to her, if you can. Or talk to her on the phone, if that's not possible. Don't attack James, but try to appeal to her with facts and data.  Raising a family on only one income is pretty difficult, even in the South.  

Are they going to try to live off the grid or form some sort of weird alt-right commune? 

Also, I know some farmers, and it's a pretty rough life unless you're already independently wealthy or have other sources of income. "
463,"1. Stop splitting shared bills 50/50. If she makes 2.5 X more than she should be paying 2.5X more than you on shared expenses. You are subsidizing her ability to save by paying more of a % of your income towards bills. This isn't fair to you.

2. Redistribute chores so that both of you has equal leisure time.

3. Tell her you have a minimum requirement of alone time during which you will do whatever you choose and her criticism of your preferences of free time will be considered disrespect and not tolerated.

4. Ask her, honestly, if she wants this marriage to work. Because it sounds like she's setting you up to fail. That's not how partnership works.

My biggest concern is your safety. You sound intimidated by him or what he might be capable of.  If he approaches you again, make it clear that you are uncomfortable speaking about this anymore.

466,"Okay, from the perspective of a second year writing class, these are the musings of someone who had a life before you. Yeah, these might be about her ex, but if I'm gonna get analytical here (because I am a pedantic jackass) she's saying that she remembers a time when she loved that person, but that person doesn't exist. these are poems about memories. Calm down, dude.  
  
This whole thing is you looking into something that you didn't have any right to look into. It was basically the equivalent of reading her journal. Don't read that stuff unless you want to read EVERYTHING about her, including stuff that has zero to do with you. These poems have ZERO to do with you. Honestly, if I were her I'd be mad as hell. Like, just SUPER mad, and I'd be justified in being so. Just because you're with someone doesn't give you unrestricted access to everything that she's ever felt.  
  
Honestly? You should feel bad because you did a dumb thing. And either admit you snooped (and found exactly nothing), and risk her dumping you. Or you act like you never saw this, and you NEVER snoop again. EVER. Because you're just gonna have a bad time because you'll realize you aren't the only man she's ever cared about.

475,"So a couple things going on here.

Number one, I get so absorbed in what I'm doing sometimes that I simply don't hear people talking to me. Even if what they're saying is important. I simply don't hear it. This doesn't mean I'm ignoring them, it means I'm occupied and they need to get my attention before they tell me things or ask questions. My husband usually does this with my name or by asking me directly for a verbal response--this usually cuts through my absorption. Maybe next time instead of trying the same thing five times and getting the same results, maybe switch up your tactics.

Number two, she didn't like your tone and she's allowed to have boundaries about that. The appropriate response is to accept her boundary, monitor your behavior in the future, and change your approach to limit the likelihood that you're going to be tempted to yell in the first place. If this sounds like too much work, you're allowed to decide it's a deal-breaker. Got to say, though, most people don't like being yelled at and developing better conflict-handling habits is important.

Three, involving her mother and using money as a way to punish you is preeeeeeetty bad. Then again, you started dating a 17-year-old. You don't get to date someone younger and then complain they're immature."

You were enjoying a trip with your family. What exactly is he so afraid of?

489,"&gt; Countless times we've discussed how we kind of imagined our first times with weed to be, and we thought it'd be fun and just nice to share the memory together when it comes.

This seems like the point to me - she thought this would be a shared thing you could do together, and you blew that plan off and did it with guys from work instead. Yes, her reaction seems a bit extreme, but if you're telling her it's not a big deal when **to her it is a big deal**, that's just going to amplify the issue.

Yes she should talk about it like an adult rather than cut you off, but maybe try and see things a bit from her perspective too, rather than basically gleefully tell her ""hey, you know that thing we'd planned to do together?

Or they will have a program of purely secular importance (e.g. a food pantry) and invite donations from the outside.

But no legitimate church is going to fund its general operations from cash donations from non-Christians.  It's completely unscriptural.

Doing so doesn't make them a ""cult"" necessarily - but it does mean they are not following normal Christian practices and beliefs.

There are supposed ""churches"" that send nonsense in the mail asking for contributions.  For example, ever since I voted in my first Republican primary, I started getting mailings from this one ""church"" where they would send a piece of paper that they said was a prayer rug, ask me to write my prayer needs on this prayer rug and mail it back to them, along with a contribution, and they would pray for it.

Six months is also not a huge amount of time, honestly. My advice would be to stick with it - you obviously do care about her and enjoy her company. Just let her know that you really value your alone time to decompress and enjoy the things that you like to do by yourself.

I remember walking on the street with my friend when we were in like 7th grade and two guys who looked to be in their late 20s pulled up next to us and started barking like dogs at us really aggressively. That freaked me out. Or the time I was walking to school in 5th grade and old men would cat call me from their cars literally every single day and someone threw metal change at me from their car once (it actually really hurt). Scary how many pedos there really are out there. "
507,"Memories are fluid, so they're already suspect for everyone.  Combine that with knowing I have TBI (traumatic brain injury) and I have no idea.  It's the brain, it's not like suddenly waking up without vision.  It's not ""Well, I would've thought this before, but now I think this"".

I think I'm mostly the same, but I can't talk circles around people anymore. I was a natural born lawyer with a brain like a thesaurus, but now I need to stop to think of words.  It kicked the legs out from under me.  I look better writing because I can think and I can use Google to come up with words that I can no longer remember.  "
508,"You slept with one of those girls in the couple of weeks you were broken up and told her about it, then told her you were going out to dinner with that same girl? Yeah, she would be angry. It shows that you're not really interested in her feelings or respecting your relationship. Obviously your relationship is not on firm ground and she would feel insecure about that. You should try to have more empathy for other people in general and work on imagining how your actions make other people feel—or just listen when they tell you how they feel instead of calling their feelings ""stupid"". You're also ignoring your (ex) girlfriend's feelings when she's already told you what she wants (which was to break up). She might still have feelings for you and be conflicted, but the final message was that you two are done.

If I were you, I would text her and say that you understand if she doesn't want to meet after all, and that you respect her decision to break up and you will give her some space. Then actually stop talking to her for a while."
509,"Especially because if OP responded in the moment and was upset, OP's BF could possibly have gaslighted her and made her look/feel like the crazy partner for fighting in front of friends. I also wouldn't have addressed it at the time and would have waited like OP did until we were alone and addressed it then. I think OP did the right thing. "
510,[deleted]
511,"I had an ex like this. Looking back, he was emotionally abusive. It was a push and pull thing. He would be detached and somewhat cold when he felt in control of the relationship, but when I started to come to terms with being single and happier without him, he went into the buy back period and promised to change, made some lovely gestures etc. it kept going like this until I finally left him. Once I was out of the relationship, I realized how much of me was smothered by him. Obviously you are the expert in your relationship, but you will know on some level if things are right for you. If you have doubts, pleas move on as you're stopping yourself from finding a better relationship while holding on to this one. "
512,[deleted]
513,"&gt; So my wife and I have been together for a while. Had 5 years of traveling and adventure. We never really fought and couldn't imagine being happier with anyone else. We decide to have a baby as that seemed to be the next natural step.

Did you actually want a child or did you do it only because it was ""the next natural step""? Unfortunately it seems like a lot of people just have children because ""that's what they are supposed to do"" and they never actually take the time to decide what they want. If having a child isn't something you consciously wanted then you need to consider how to address that."
514,"Why should you get to decide what the answer is? I don't know why that's supposed to be acceptable and I still wonder if you'd give other people assaulting others the same out. It was not my baby, but obviously, every child raised right and safely is making the world better and every child mistreated is making the world a sadder place. 

Hey, I wouldn't be bullying her, but yes I don't blame her coworkers and I don't feel sorry for her. I think it's one of those boundaries things. I for one don't believe you can come back from that. If you believe otherwise, that's fine. As I said, I do understand you, too, but I understand myself, too. "
515,"Um he sounds very insecure about your LDR and knowing what your doing and where you are. 

How long have you been together? 

How often do you see each other face to face? 

How long till the LDR is short distance? "
516,"The hygiene thing is something you should deffo mention, but I think you're being unreasonable to expect a face full of makeup and smart clothes at home. "
517,Make your bratty son write a 1500 word essay on why his actions were wrong and what he has learnt from it and present the essay to your boyfriend and his son 
518,"Nice bit of rationalization. For what it's worth,  I've never shared intimate details with a friend,  nor have they shared them with me - not even when we've dated the same guy at some point. 

My fiancé is the type of guy who lets others know that sharing private photos is wrong,  both in terms of the law and morality.  Keep sharing pictures that weren't intended for you - you'll end up in court like that playboy model.  Bodily autonomy is serious business these days.  You ruin sharing nudes for everyone by being a creep and sharing them. 
"
519,"Yeah, go to therapy to come to terms with that that toxic person did to you, not go to therapy to fix the toxic person. Or at least that's how I've always seen the therapy comments. "
520,"I think that trying to learn someone's native language so you can better communicate with them and/or their family is a great thing. Get new friends, learn a new language and you'll be fine."
521,"It's gaslighting, and invalidating."
522,[removed]
523,"This is EXACTLY what it sounds like to me, too.  It's the kind of ""help"" that is actually unbelievably condescending and infantilizing to the group in question."
524,"Where is she ""shaming"" him? Fucking Christ, people here are so sensitive. "
525,"I like this advice. Your bro is still your best friend, but you'll have to show him in different ways. Work and family is gonna stress him out on some days, so just lending an ear will be the world to him. He's just in a different stage of life. 

You'll probably experience this with friends, so take this heads up."
526,the op replied that he has to travel one and a half hours to go see his dad. so that would not be good for the baby who will need mom to feed. 
527,"That's what he wants though. He probably also thinks he wants a relationship with her, but he doesn't know her well enough to be in love with her. If he did, he'd respect her boundaries and realize she's not interested in him. If he doesn't know or respect her enough for that much consideration, how ""real"" can this be?

He's *in love with the idea* of her and *in lust with the image* of her but *he's not in love with her.*

Probably."
528,"&gt; he called me something like a ""prude 50s c**k tease"" because I never was ready to have sex with him and then said something like ""you're a baby machine with your brains, nothing more.""


No no no no no. Even if you two dated, that doesn't give him the right to harass you. To be sure this is harassment and you need to document and save all communication.

&gt;He said no one would believe me anyways and the kicker was this morning I woke up ""if you repeat things I said, it will only hurt you, the xxxxxx department and the university""

He threatened you not to tell. Which means he KNOWS there is a way he can get into BIG trouble. 

What I would do is contact the Dean of students anonymously. Provide context and details to what is going on without giving his name. Record what they advise you to do and what measures would typically be taken if a student were to report this to the school officially. Document what they tell you would be their action plan and ask if this situation has ever occurred and how they handled it. 

Do not provide them with your name and keep yourself anonymous. This is a call for you to get policy information and documentation to hold the Dean of students accountable when/if it comes time.

&gt;I have no idea what to do, I'm not really a gossipy person by nature but he was such a creep that this almost goes beyond gossip and things his supervisor needs to know. 

You are right, it is something his supervisor should know. It is irresponsible and most likely a violation of school policy. However, being that this guy holds the esteem you say he does, it is not only likely you are not his first victim but his superiors have had reports and have ignored them to keep the school ""prestige"" from him being a well known leader.

So, this is where I would suggest contacting the Senior editor of the school's newspaper. If they want to bite, let them know what you expect (if you want to remain anonymous for as long as possible) and what you will provide for the story. If they are a good newspaper dept. they will start to dig. 

Let them do this work if you are only interested in providing information as an effort to get this guy busted. You are the victim here. Be involved as much as you are comfortable.

The good thing about the school newspaper is that this is what they live for. This is what they will talk about in their 1st job interview out of college. You will not have to have the burden on you for revealing this scumbag and they will also have more access to getting information of possible other victims of his harrasment.

When the story breaks, it will be too big of a story for supervisors and unaccountable school administrators to ignore or shove under the carpet.

&gt;Also a part of me feels like I'm applying for jobs out of state

Sounds like a good reason you CAN speak up!

&gt;Should I just keep quiet?

Will you regret not speaking up? If yes, speak up! 

If you are finding yourself being re-victimized by taking any action as a result of his harassment towards you, do not speak up. This is not your burden to carry, you are the victim and you owe yourself health and positivity in life, same as before you met him.

Good luck and I'm sorry he put you in this situation. I know you are strong and will get through this whichever way you go!

530,"I don't think you should stay OP, it's clearly been damaging to your health. I think you need some space, some time to yourself to process things without her being there to reignite you're feelings for her, and a good network of friends and family to comfort you. 

Whatever happens, if you do those three things you'll figure out what you want to do. But don't forget, she's shown you her true colours; if you want to agree that she'll change then so be it, but to go to this extent to lie clearly
Shows a lack of respect and therefore perhaps there's not much stopping her from doing it again. 

Good luck. "
531,"But where did he gaslight her? 

He accused her of spacing out, which is true. 
He apologized for calling her names, so he doesn't claim he didn't insult her. 
He gets angry for her not apologizing, which OP never did. 

He is an asshole, but during the conversation he never claimed something happened/didn't happen that didn't happen/happened. "
532,"I think you just write it off, the apology ball is pretty much in her court. "
533,"Hey OP, did/does your SO do more of the household chores? Like when you were in residency, did he pick up the slack? If so, he might be putting in more time 'working' than you think. Does he do nice things for you with the larger amount of time he has, like cook dinner? How is your chore division?

Does the lack of ambition bother you? Or the passion for something? Would you prefer someone who's as motivated and driven as yourself? If he had a busy career, would you be disappointed that you'd probably less time together?

Just some questions that popped up in my mind, I hope you'll be happy with whatever choice you make :)"
534,They still have his bed
535,"Actually, it was the sending calls to voice mail that bothers me. It's like seeing your SO across the street and messaging them ""what's up"" and watching them check their phone, sigh and ignore. Not cool. "
536,Because you left SO while he was crying and needed you after having to defend himself from his abuser. And because you are afraid of him. Basically in your world violence doesn't exist because you are so sheltered that you never had to deal with it. You never had to think about your safety because other people always took care of that. Well nobody is going to protect him but he himself. 
537,"Okay, thank you. "
538,In this situation I really do think it concerns her. If it was a roommate or whatever I'd agree with you but it is so inappropriate for a boyfriend to essentially make an income off of his girlfriend like this.
539,"you are an adult, time to let your parents know that! this is also 2017 not 1958, times they are a changing. dont let them control you to the point you lose the love of your life and resent them forever"
540,"I don't let my husband read everything I write because otherwise I would censor myself the first few drafts.  Also, he's not a professional writer and tends to be overly effusive with his praise which doesn't push me the way I need to be pushed. OP – if you are working toward publication, he will eventually read it. But for now you have no obligation to let anybody look at your work. Writing is a very personal art form for many people and until you want outside eyes on it you don't have to share a thing. Maybe just tell him that at this point you feel like what you're writing is more similar to a journal and you're not at a point where you want to share it yet. Just because he's your husband doesn't mean you have to show him.

Edit: typo"
541,Or a fanfic author. Surprised he didnt mention cupid's bow when talking about her lips. 
542,"Can I present a different possibility? 

Is is possible that your friends husband feels like he has a hard time as it is to get the attention of your friend and he is competing with you for her attention? 

The reality is this is her husband. On the day they got married he became more important than you in her life. If he feels like it is a struggle to get her to give him attention (especially if that is the way he translates love and intimacy), he may feel like you two are competing and he is losing. 

Your friend may not be letting on to you that her marriage has some intimacy problems, or she at not even be aware that her husband feels this way, but I don't think the husband necessarily has an invalid argument by default. It could simply be that your friend is forgetting that her husband is by far first and foremost in her life and relationships, and he is failing to talk to her in an adult manner about it. "
543,"&gt;i am a jealous type of guy


That's not an excuse to be a controlling asshole. "

545,"The charitable interpretation here is that they're calling your phone because they know the kids will be with you even if they're not at home and that since it's a habit now, they don't realize it's an intrusion.

This is a perfectly reasonable boundary to draw with the parents.  You should just have a conversation that is like ""I know it's easiest to call my phone because you know the kids will be there, but I'd really prefer not to have the kids using my personal phone for extended conversations.  How would you like to handle this?  Should I have the kids call you back from the landline or from their iPad?""  Then let them decide how they'd like to communicate.

I wouldn't be surprised if they continue to call you, but in the future, when the parent calls, you can say ""Junior would love to talk to you!  Shall I have him call you back from the iPad, or do you want to call the house phone?""  "
546,"Being drunk, she may have simply meant she doesn't want grandkids in the near future, and suddenly she's in a grandmother role to a kid she doesn't feel a connection to who is admittedly ""a handful."" 

I'm not defending her, just maybe shedding a little light into what she may have meant by that.

Although it's odd that OP has no idea what triggered this. If OP is doing all the laundry, buying her own groceries and cleaning up after herself and her son, those are usually the triggers for someone not wanting the person around, so it is a sad mystery why the woman's turned on her. I can't believe it would just be a toddler's antics flipping her crazy switch."
547,"I think it would be helpful to reframe the issue. Saying you're uncomfortable with sharing **your** personal life, and your daughter is **your** personal life won't work. It discounts that your daughter is equally yours and her father's child. 

Instead, do some reading about the various reasons for keeping children's photos off the Internet. Safety, consent, etc. Bring those concepts to the table, along with good articles. Make this the first of many, many coparenting disagreements you and your ex and potential partners will have to discuss rationally and clearly. "
548,"I would feel the same way, somehow indebted with little to nothing to give as repayment. Here's the thing, though. They like you, they see good things in you and they want to see you succeed. They are *investing* in you with shelter, support and basic needs with a little celebration in there, too. You repay them by doing your best and being the best person you can be to them, yourself, your girl and the world. Someday you might be able to treat them when you are on your own feet. Do you feel pressured to stay with your girlfriend because of this?"
549,"It didn't kill him enough to never do it after the first time. It didn't kill him enough that he LET YOU GO CRAZY over it.

550,"Loose drawstring capris (for wading) and a light, breezy long-sleeve shirt are great for the beach. Bring sunscreen and a good hat, and tell everyone you're protecting your skin from the sun. Which you absolutely should be doing--your future skin will thank you. "
551,"So, he doesn't take you seriously when you state your intentions, he thinks your desire to determine *your own name* is a ""kick,""  and he doesn't see the point of getting married unless it's to allow him to control your last name?

IMO, if you approach him at all, it should be to graciously offer him the opportunity to apologize."
552,I hope one of you has green eyes. Get a DNA test on that baby.
553,"Listen to what she's saying and consider it.  Is she coming from a rational point of view, or is it obvious that she's grasping at straws to conform to her new social group? 

You might want to bring it up sometime when you are both relatively calm and ask her what's up.  It could also be that these things are bothering her but she hasn't been comfortable raising them until she experienced her coworker's complaints and now realizes that her issues are valid. 
"
554,"Sounds like she's really sick of you criticising her.  

Maybe you should look into why you feel the need to be constantly criticising your wife. 

If you are complaining about her so much that her turning it around onto you is annoying, imagine how she feels to be the target all the time in the first place!

555,"If it was your face, their sexuality would be irrelevant. There's no special face you can make that just gay men hate.

556,Maybe He doesn't even know who the father is?
557,"I disagree. I'd want him to keep it a secret in this scenario (only seeing as how it was so long ago and the fact that he truly believes he has changed). Would it bother him? Yes. But that's the price he was to pay. If he told me, he'd feel relief from his guilt and I'd be the one who had to live with that knowledge. It's his burden. "
558,"If she invites you to dinner again, I would politely decline. Or you could host her at your house and be extremely passive aggressive about portion size and how she's allowed to eat whatever she likes."
559,"you're not wrong, but you need to realize that him not saying you're beautiful is not the same thing as him not thinking you're beautiful.

it sounds like you should read the love languages book.  people have different ways of communicating that they care about people.  for some people it's verbal. for others it's doing things for them.  realizing what languages you both use can help you realize that he might be showing you in other ways."
560,Yeah the weight is just an excuse. She was never that attracted to you to begin with I think :( you can find someone whose attraction won't be gone after the honeymoon.
561,"If you were 70, you'd already be in the mall walkers club. "
562,"I agree with this. Being too ""tired"" to go to a friend's wedding that you already RSVPed to and knew that was important to OP? That's not an excuse, it's laziness and disrespect.

563,"Thank you.  I'm built more like a linebacker than a ballerina and I still have trouble lifting with my husband who has 5 inches on me.  What's silly is I can lift my ocean kayak (70ish pounds) by myself and load it into the truck but that task becomes harder when he wants to help!  
Not to mention but lifting nicely balanced, compacted weights with handles is really different from picking up a 13 foot kayak or a weird shaped box or a piece of furniture.  I mean movers, nurses and construction workers have special tools to move big stuff for a reason!  "

Also, actually have other plans. Don't be waiting around all week for this girl to make time for you. Do other stuff that fills your life with meaning. Gym routine, grabbing a beer with a friend, etc are all important commitments that you can keep."
577,"This reminds me of my ex in soo many ways (I am a hetero girl btw.) I could ask him 5 different ways not to mess around with my TV/video game/computer setup, but I'd always come home to things in the wrong position/place. Then I would get mad. Then he would act so surprised that I found it a big deal. Like, no it's not a big deal that you moved the charger. It's the fact that I've asked you nicely 5 times to do this one simple thing.

Lead to me doing really stupid passive aggressive shit, like hiding the remote control. Don't be like me. "
578,"i agree that they didn't do anything ""wrong"" but what they did is extremely manipulative... not necessarily in a bad way but working together in secret to steer a situation the way you want around something as major as getting someone married (probably not part of the original plan, but still the natural result if their planning works out) is pretty much the definition of manipulative.

decided to look it up: control or influence (a person or situation) cleverly, unfairly, or unscrupulously.

so yeah, extremely manipulative. i would have a huge problem knowing that a major aspect of my life was controlled by my friends and family without my knowledge."
579,"You haven't offered any advice on how to make OP's situation work more smoothly, aside from ""ditch your lifelong dream because your husband is insecure.""

583,"I grew up in a middle class neighborhood with an alarm on the house and constantly locked doors. I've lived multiple places, including across the street from a maximum security prison, the absolute shitty side of town, and on multiple closed access military bases, and I still lock my doors at night. It's not because I'm looking down my nose at people, it's simply because I don't want to become a robbery/rape/murder statistic...or have to scrub blood and brains out of the carpet from a well placed 12 gauge blast. 

There are shitty people in this world that have zero issues with harming others and taking what doesn't belong to them. You just got a taste of that. Stop treating your girlfriend like she's some paranoid idiot and start looking at her like a rational adult. Take 2 seconds to get off your high horse and actually google the crime rates for your area. How often are people mugged, robbed, assaulted, raped, and killed within about 5-10 square miles of your home? Now imagine 50% of the population is bigger, stronger, and faster than you are. That's what she lives with on a daily basis, and society tells us girls it's our job to keep ourselves safe. If she gets hurt/killed, she was ""asking for it"", or ""she shouldn't have been there/known better"". You can either admit you fucked up royally and hope she forgives you, or you can continue on as you have been and hope it's not worse next time."

Actions speak louder than words. He can piss and moan all he wants, what doesn't change is that him and your sister betrayed your trust and turned you into a private joke. It wasn't until he thought he was caught that he was sorry. 

It doesn't change that he selfishly led you on to be in a relationship knowing full well you wouldn't be with him had you known the truth.

And then waiting 5 years and you having a kid to tell you!?! That is emotional manipulation and flat out cruel. I'd even go so far as to say its abuse. 

And now you're supposed to just get over it and forgive him? Fuck him, and fuck your sister. You can easily do better than the both of them. "

WTF? Super insulting. 

&gt; Well yes, there are ethnically Chinese people in certain countries but that doesn't erase a country's individual culture and make them automatically Chinese. There are a lot Chinese people in Jamaica but that doesn't mean Jamaica is basically China.

Exactly. It's like saying American and British culture are the same because a lot of Americans have British heritage. 

I'm an Australian who lived and taught English in Vietnam for two years. I met a few western visitors like this. To me, Vietnamese culture is so complex and foreign that it took me two years just to get a grasp on what I didn't understand. But I met Americans who rocked up for six months, didn't mix much with Vietnamese people (often except for the ""girlfriend"" they immediately acquired, the one they dumped just before they left), and were experts on all things Vietnamese. So cringeworthy.

Your friend sounds like an idiot. Seek distance until she grows up. "
597,"contraception can fail too. Nothing is 100% secure to be honest. and if you only see him twice a month i really dont see the reason for you to take hormonal contraception. try explaining it to him. just like you respect him and his scars, he needs to respect your decisions about your body. do it in a nice way and i am sure you will sort it out.  

"
598,"&gt; I say forget her

I 100% agree with you. Fiancee is embarassed, and she should be. She's not even married to the guy and she's making demands about his house and family. "
599,"Right, OP has to be a troll, no one is this dumb in life."
600,"Was it CGI?  If not, he still contributed to the harming of innocent children, and he *should* feel remorse about that."
601,"All true, the trouble will be living costs while at uni - youth allowance is hard to get if you have parents that earn/own property, if you haven't officially gained independent status."
602,"Its funny how people think surgery is the limit. Not the braces where you live with metal in your mouth for years, not tanning where you look orange, making your hair blond when you are brunette, putting paint on your face so you look different. No, removing a hump from a nose is where the line is drawn. "
603,"She wasn't happy.  There's your ""true reason"".  Nothing more is required.  Relationships only work by mutual consent, and hers is withdrawn.  You got dumped, sorry.

It doesn't matter whether you ""feel you can work through your issues"", she doesn't want to."

605,"I lived in Italy for awhile and while I was somewhat okay with the language I wasn't fluid. Check around to see if there are any big ex-pat areas where people who speak English hang out, I found this helpful. This way you can get to know some new friends and they can also probably help you learn more about your new home/the language. 

And talk to your husband about how you're feeling. He is your partner and I bet he wants you to feel comfortable both in and out of the bedroom in you new surroundings. "
606,"&gt; I on the other hand am not sure about moving in, getting married, having kids, any of that stuff. I'm just not ready and I don't know if I'll ever be. When that topic comes up I kind of give non committal answers and push it off, which is wrong of me I know.

As you say this is very wrong of you. You're 1.5 years in and she needs to know where your relationship is going. If you don't tell her how you really feel, you are not a good person and you are wasting her time and yours.

Time to be an adult and have the conversation."
607,"Come on, everyone has clicked to know what the difference was. "
608,"Well who knows. I once had a huge list of things that bothered me about my bf anyone may have said the same thing too, but once I made the list of everything that was good and I loved about him it got easier to let the bothersome issues go. My advice is- something can bother you and you can deal with it yourself and tell the person how you feel about it, but it can be let go. So if I was you I'd say, ""I feel betrayed that you get annoyed with me when I am loving you."" You could let him know that it's uncomfortable for you to have those moments now too. You can let him know you truly love him and don't want things to end, but are at a loss as to what to do.  Maybe start finding a life designed for you. It doesn't mean he has to be out of your life, just have a life that is enjoyable to you with or without him and see what happens. If you are enjoying yourself and not connected maybe that's the best thing. If he has an issue give yourself space no matter his reaction. It will bring clarity. "
609,"OP hasn't explained exactly how she looked different. Chances are she put up some flattering photos and he was a bit disappointed (but obvs not too much at the time!). That's not lying. It's not a good way to meet someone who's attracted to you, but it's not lying."

611,"Basketball shorts are a style of shorts FYI. It's not meant to be taken as a sports team-specific article of clothing. It's like saying ""im wearing a polo shirt""


Edit: read more of his comments. He probably recognized the teams logo or colors from the group chat pic"
612,And that's just the one cheating partner that you KNOW of.
613,Increasing diversity can be a business reason. 
614,"I've never been cheated on but I can still say with confidence that what you are doing is cruel, selfish, and naive. 

Why even bother posting here if you're just going to pitch a fit when everyone calls you out on your shitty actions? If you don't want to be called out stop having an emotional and sexual affair with a married man. Bam, no more criticism. "
615,"Just to fan the flames here, OP's roommate *definitely* has had sex on OP's bed."
616,[removed]
617,"I'm sorry OP, but a few strongly spoken words probably aren't going to change your husband's views on this. Momma's boys are conditioned from birth to believe that mom ALWAYS comes first, and in this situation, where it's gotten to the point that he's *defending her when she assaults you*, that is *not* something you're going to be able to convince him of, at least not without some serious therapy. And even then, that's therapy he needs on his own - if he's not willing to accept he has a problem, which he clearly isn't, then you need to focus on yourself and your child. "
618,The very nature of consent is that it can be revoked.
619,"&gt; me feeling like he played the victim often.

Sounds like he's playing the victim now, too."
620,"&gt;Do you really think he's got the info to all my stuff? Should I change passwords or just... delete everything?  
  
Yes. And yes. I would at the very least suspend things. If I were you I would be driving to my friend's house and asking to borrow her computer. This is madness. "
621,"If one of us has a problem, the other will stop what they are doing to pay attention and listen. We talk out anything bothering us. If we argue, we hash out why it even began and apologize. We give each other space if needed. Sometimes he will rub my feet or my back without me asking him too! We take our time in bed and talk about what one wants to experience. At night we read from our books and call it a night. :) He makes a great steak too!! I could go on! I can't wait to marry him!"

623,"if you reframe your perspective I think you'll feel better about this. the fact of the matter is, you're learning valuable skills that you will carry forward throughout your adult life: what it means to work hard, not cut corners, live with integrity, cultivate discipline, etc., etc. The diligence you are demonstrating now will be an indispensable asset for you. I know it seems ""unfair"", but they are making their choices and you are making yours. Only time will tell which strategy pays off in the long term."
624,"I think I deserve to be loved and to be fought for... I think I am worth the fight... 

My parents have fought tradition and have won the love they want and they are still going strong, I think I deserve that kind of love..."
625,"lol well, I'm in SoCal (Anaheim to be specific) and would be open to that if you're local. I'm 30 as well. Sounds like our husbands would get along too. I know my post makes it sound like my husband is miserable to be around but that's not the case. I doubt that's true of yours either. We have fun. Just like you, we also have good sex. He's smart and funny. He simply doesn't have that ""grab life by the horns"" type of passion or attitude. He's a simple guy as I suspect your husband is too. I would suspect you don't fight about much else because that is true for us. To make it work you will need to find little things to appreciate. For example, my husband doesn't do gifts. He's not a romance type of guy. However, when I say I need or want something that's practical he gets it for me. One day I said I needed a bigger trash can with a step lid. That trash can showed up. How about a fan so I don't get so hot when I sleep? I got my fan without asking. A bigger cutting board so I don't make a mess? Yup. I had to learn to appreciate those actions and acknowledge that is how he shows affection. It may sound ridiculous to others that I was appreciative of a cutting board but with guys like ours it's all about subtlety. They love us but are going to show it in their own ways. Love isn't about grand gestures anyway. It's about little everyday things that show you are in his thoughts. It's about how he stops by Starbucks on the way home and gets you a frappe because he knows it will cheer you up. It's about how he knows you like chocolate chips in your pancakes so he always makes a little stack just for you even though he hates them. Then you sit together and eat your chocolatey pancakes while he eats his boring plain ones. You know what helps us a lot? A quick weekend trip. We are also childfree with dual incomes. Take advantage of it! Sometimes, just getting away for a couple of days makes everything seem less monotonous. Shakes these up a bit. Therapy will help and your post sounds like he isn't a bad guy. I bet if you told him you want to work it out he will go. I'm here to chat if you like! "
626,"OP, I've been in your girlfriend's shoes. For some people, being polyamorous is as much a part of them as being straight/bi/gay/queer etc.. I came to the conclusion that I could not be happy being monogamous... while I was in a monogamous relationship.

I didn't cheat. My partner at the time agreed to try dating other people with me. He wasn't able to handle it, and I wasn't willing to go back to monogamy. We should have broken up sooner as we weren't compatible. Now I don't date monogamous people at all - it's not fair to them and it's not fair to me.

OP, the most respectful and sensible thing you can do is break up. Don't try to force yourself into the poly mold, and don't try to force her into the mono one. You can split your lives up relatively amicably now, but if you wait until you've torn each other up in your conflict, it'll get ugly.

Good luck to both of you."
627,"One accomplishment junkie to another: dude, you gotta find the pay off. That means you need a whole mentally shift towards finding the payoff in a totally uncharted area: DOMESTICITY.

There are gems there. Instead of closing a deal you're growing a human. Instead of flying cross country you're teaching a being you created a whole new language structure (like when your kid says DADA for the first time). 

If you feel nothing for that you have two options: counseling to conform. Or, being that piece of shit that gets a pack of cigarettes... you know the one.

Either way you will be fine. You'll find your way."
628,that's not at all what OP is doing. It's just shitty timing and has put things into perspective for her. She already stated that she would be there for him; as a lover or not. 
629,"Im sorry to hear this, this sucks for sure. My girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me and I felt the same way. Took a solid 3 months to finally get the pit out of my stomach and another like 2 to feel okay about everything. Literally the best answer is it takes time. And make sure you force yourself to be with friends and/or people. That helps a lot too. "
630,"So... your coworker might be stealing your pens, putting them back just to mess with you? And also moved the magnets in a way where they look pornographic? Just trying to make sure I got all that. 

If you feel like your friendship with a married coworker is starting to pass a boundary then cut down on your contact and conversations. Your friendship has already reached past normal circumstances if you both miss out on actually working, because you're both too busy talking. That and you're crushing on a married man who flirts with you. Dial it back. 

If you have mental health issues in the past and you're starting to feel uneasy now, talk to your doctor if you need to start up therapy again. "
631,"You need to never give your mum the space or opportunity to say those things again. She's getting this worked up over shoes! SHOES. 

If she has this much of a problem tell her she doesn't need to come to the wedding. She could wear clown shoes and your mother shouldn't say those things about her jeez. "
632,"That's true, and I meant to add that there's no reason for him *not* to go to the doctor and be evaluated for dementia at the very least. It's just that (when I posted) everyone was immediately jumping toward brain tumors and the like. I just feel like /r/relationships tends to think zebras instead of horses, sometimes..."
633,So if your imaginary girlfriend had sexy pictures of her coworkers you'd be alright?
634,"Off topic response, I know, but what brand rotary cutter do you use? Mine kind of sucks and yours sounds pretty effective."
635,"Agreed. Also just wanted to say that it feels like you are doing the same thing your mom did when your stepdad banned you from the house. She just let him, instead of fighting to see her child (although there is the possibility that she didn't want to see you either). While she is your mom and you may care for her to some degree, she's not infallible and the way you paint the picture of her behavior compared to your stepmom I don't understand why you would consider not having your stepmom at any of these events let alone a speech at the wedding. Sounds like she did more parenting for you then your ""mom"" ever did after the divorce. I hope your stepmom and dad are the ones in the seat closest to you when you are at the end of the aisle."
636,"You know what to do. You're just hesitating to pull the trigger. And I understand that, because I'm also the kind of person to put themselves behind everyone else, but it's only been a year and a half with this guy. Don't invest more time into being unhappy. :/

The important thing to remember is that a breakup isn't a discussion. It doesn't require a mutual agreement. You decide you're done, and that's that.

In regards to the living situation, because you rent from relatives they should be on your side with evicting him. Plus I can't imagine they would let him stay with ""squatter rights"" or whatever shit he's pulled before. You can check tenancy laws in your area (generally he needs 30 days of notice, but after that period, the cops can evict him)."
637,"You really shouldn't have waited until the last minute to find a job. As you're experiencing now, things pile up, and pressure increases for everyone involved. That being said, your father seriously overreacted. You do not deserve to have insults hurled at you, or to have financial aid or his love (???) rescinded just because you didn't want to spend your summer the way he wanted you to. 

You might have to wait for a bit to see how things are after everything has blown over. At this point, there's really no way for you to tell if your father is bluffing about not letting you go to where you had found jobs, or any of his other threats. 

As for your boyfriend, let him go permanently. He sounds incredibly immature and selfish. "
638,"I don't know, I'd still be pretty pissed. I had issues with constant bleeding for 5 years straight. Not once did my boyfriend make negative comments about it or make me feel gross and unattractive. It never even occurred to me to feel gross and unattractive because of it. "
639,Op do not go to counciling with this man
640,there's also a difference between an 'admin assistant' and 'assistant'. 
641,"His financial sotuation is tight right? And you knew that beforehand?

Just because he wants to do something nice for you, doesn't mean he can. He wanted to take you on a date but knows that he should be on a budget. I think he expected you to understand that without him needing to restate it again. He is embarrassed about this."
642,"I mean, I was born with a hormonal profile that lent itself to acne. Not cystic, painful, physically debilitating acne, but enough that it was cosmetically unattractive. Would you say my going on accutane to permanently alter my skin is also me living a lie, or is the arbitrary line drawn at surgical intervention? To me it was more about taking care of something that bothered me and made my life less happy. Easy choice.

Also, if I want to get a nose job but don't because you as my partner are against it, am I not conforming to someone else's beauty standard regardless?"
643,"Yeah, I agree.  I could easily have a more high-powered career if I wanted to, but I've chosen to stay where I'm at because I enjoy my current job and it offers work-life balance that higher positions don't.  That's not a ""mistake"" or even lack of ambition, it's recognition of what I want in life and what is important to me - I value my time outside work over having a high-powered job.  The husband in this scenario could very well be the same, and that doesn't mean he's wrong or making a mistake."
644,Or for laughing while she cried and then antagonizing her with what made her cry?
645,"&gt;  I owe it to the person I married to get to the bottom of it

you owe it to yourself to get the fuck away from this lunatic"
646,Does the boyfriend have a key to your flat?  This is most likely a violation to your lease agreement.
647,"Im in the UK as well OP, we always just split evenly as well despite room size. I think the split by room size is an American thing?"
648,"She said she also got into a heated argument with him and said some stuff.


There's two sides of a story. What if she blew up on him and called him a ""babydick, good-for-nothing, asshole?""

We're only seeing one side of the story and OP hasn't made any replies, either.

I have a hard time believing there's only one culprit here."
649,"You do realize she may not want to raise sons to be like you, or daughters with a man who is so disrespectful to women?"
650,"The only positive things you've said about your wife - that she's lovely and friendly - were undercut by this:

&gt; and the person she really is (jealous, paranoid, insecure).

If that's how you see her essential self, that's not going to help your marriage. That's a step away from contempt, which is poison to any marriage.

I know you don't want to get yelled at about the open marriage thing, but you have to understand that that probably confirmed all of her worst fears, especially in tandem with the other changes you've made. I think you should take that seriously instead of dismissing her as jealous, paranoid, insecure etc, and work to show her that you want marriage with HER to work. 

I'm not saying that this is all your fault - short of abuse, few things really are all one person's fault in a marriage. And I agree that you should insist on counseling. But combined with your comment below, where you didn't seem to get the concept of dating your wife, I'm willing to guess that she's starved for affection from you. Try going out of your way to be kind to her."
651,"I want to make it very clear - you are NOT a monster. Not in any kind of way. It sounds like you did everything 100% right - you warned him in advance, you had discussions with him, you had a safe word, etc. It was on HIM to tell you that he didn't enjoy what was happening.

I think at this point you need to break up with him (since it is obvious he does not enjoy what you enjoy). "
652,Why did she ask you to leave though? And why did you grab all your clothes? That must've been a big fight. Why did you leave that part out lol
653,"If you don't want people going through your post history, use a throwaway. Whinging about it and getting snippy about it just makes you look immature."
654,"i dont have any words of advice really because i feel like i could have literally written 90% of your story. this is exactly how i feel with my wife after being together a little bit longer than you two.

was your husband always that way, since you started dating? or has he recently just changed?
I am worried that my wife is depressed because she never used to be that way, but if you compared her today to 5 years ago (which i know you shouldnt do) it would be surprising. She was passionate and focused. now, like your husband, 99% of the responses are ""if you want"" ""i dont care"" ""well what do you want?"" ""sure whatever"". Even though i know that she has preferences. 

Unfortunately for us, the sex life isnt as good as yours as thats another area thats ""well if you want to"", which is a huge turnoff.

i would love her to suggest an outing, or activity....or hell....i would just love her to suggest something for dinner at this point. 

My only suggestion is find things that make you happy. Maybe without him. I dont mean leaving him, but make some plans with a group of friends. or do a hobby on your own that you are passionate about. It could be that you are unwittingly doing the same ""whatever, i dont mind"", and he is just reflecting some of that. Maybe if he sees your passion he will follow. And even if he doesnt, at least you find something that is bringing you happiness in your life."
655,"Thank you, I'm glad you did. 

However, my personal opinion is that he's betraying you by behaving this way. Not the other way around, even if you were more specific on the call."
656,"I'm sure paying for you to break your lease is nothing to them so long as it prevents you from going through what your sister's friend went through. You'll get to the point where you don't feel guilty someday, for now just let your feelings and emotions happen"
657,"It's doubtful that he's going to change. If you can't stand things like that happening constantly and you can't work out something with him, then I suggest dumping him."
658,Positive relationships don't behave in this way.
659,"Right, of course you are. You've been told by several people to get over it an leave him alone. You're saying that you just enjoy talking to him so much that you can't stand the thought of not talking to him anymore, yet you say yourself that you only kind of text ""from time to time"". Clearly his priority is with his girlfriend, not with you, so when he's with her, he wants to focus all his attention on *her*, not his ex that he kind of sort of talks to sometimes. His girlfriend might not be okay with him talking to you while they're together- which is a perfectly fine boundary to have. I was good friends of SEVEN YEARS with a guy I dated and didn't want to end our connection after we broke up. Guess what, I had to, because his new girlfriend didn't want us talking. It hurts, but that's the real world, you have to suck it up and leave them alone.  

Again, get over it and grow up. "
660,"Girl, your relationship is a farce if it's not honest.  You have no leg to stand on in this. 

Also, you gave up on him when you cheated on him, so I think your perception of your personal priorities and loyalty is warped af."
661,"I think the mother should agree to get her tubes tied and forfeit some inheritance money, in order to keep her kid out of foster care. Why shouldn't she have to put some skin in the game here? 

I was just following your logic to the end. If most CPS placements are temporary and you're so confident she'll turn it around, then what is the big deal in letting the kid go to foster care for a bit until she gets it together? 

And you *still* haven't answered my other question. Are they obligated to adopt a second child if she does have another?"
662,"Did they get evicted from their apartment because of the disturbance? Why are they trying to stay with you?! Actually, it doesn't really matter. I'd tell them they had to go. I'd blame it on the landlord--that you're not allowed to have long term guests not giant dogs and you'll all be kicked out if they don't leave. (Even if that's not entirely true) Since your landlord doesnt want them there, maybe he'd be willling to come over and tell them they need to leave? Hopefully, that'll motivate them to get out. If not, call the police. "
663,Oh god I don't even know where to start with this. She seems not only mentally ill but also extremely toxic and just bad for you. I hope you do what's best for both of you. 
664,[removed]
665,"She wants to wear it. Her face, her choice. It's not your place to tell her not to wear as much make up. "
666,"I love going to the mall by myself, browsing the departments I want to see at my own pace and not having to deal with a friend or partner who is constantly huffing or rolling their eyes at me about how long I'm taking."
667,"Yea i'm putting bs on the surprise party thing. I'd even guess she invented that on the spot to throw you off. I think your instincts are right, those people hang out with you out of convenience. I know it can be hard but you deserve better friends."
668,Calculated swipe. No doubts here.
669,"The thing is, he should know that showing up at the wife's work event isn't about him. He's an adult, and he is there representing her in her place of work and should step up to the challenge. As a more general comment for this thread, I am absolutely baffled at the excuses that are being thrown out that basically amount to: men should not be expected to dress for a formal event without wifey/mummy's help. Ridiculous. "
670,"I emphasize with you. 

Maybe you can send a text asking how their weekend was, have him reply, and then say ""oh that sounds fun! Do you have any pictures from ____?"" 

If you send a text, it gives him something concrete to go off of, and at his own pace.

Asking how the park/zoo/birthday party/whatever went is a great way to stay up to date AND ask for pictures or a video. 

Also, you say they have social media, perhaps an occasional ""(grandchilds name) looks so happy!"" Or ""cute outfit!"" Or something to that effect. 

Just don't overdo commenting on the pictures, but occasional grandma gushing over the pictures signals how happy you are to see how the child is doing, etc."
671,"I agree, and I don't get the ""but it's just a party!"" attitude. I have been to no casual parties in my 10+ years of adulthood that include mailed invitations and RSVP cards. Only weddings. Unless the OP is leaving out that they sent out invitations on Facebook and not through the actual mail, it's super super rude.

Now, if the friend didn't mean to fall asleep? I understand that, and it would be easier to forgive. But if she knew in advance she was going to skip it for sleep, that's super rude."
672,"It's possible to have different, but equally important relationships with different people.

I am head over heels for my SO. But my best friend is the person I've known for close to a decade, who has gone through some of my worst times with me, and whom I trust unconditionally. This relationship will likely endure for the rest of my life. It's impossible to compare those two relationship dynamics, and it would be weird and extremely unhealthy of me to distance myself from my best friend who's like a sister to me *just* so my boyfriend could take some sort of imaginary first place on my emotional landscape. Likewise, I don't expect him to stop being best friends with the guy he's known since he was in grade school. We relate to those two people differently than we do to each other. That doesn't mean that anyone is ""cheating"". 

Also, tbh platonic cheating is pretty much an oxymoron. Cheating implies breaking an exclusive, *romantic* connection. I mean, you do what you want in your life, but calling a best friend relationship cheating is really really indicative of an unhealthy, possessive, isolating dynamic imo."
673,"I can't believe no one has said this yet.  The main problem is not his being obsessed with a character or not.  The problem is that he doesn't listen to you or care when you express how your feelings are hurt.

THAT is a dumpable offense.  He doesn't get to pick how you should feel.  These days people have all sorts of unique relationships to games that may or may not be problematic depending on the individual, but everybody still has the same standard of empathy."
674,"It seems like all OP's wife cares about is herself and her appearance as a ""successful"" woman.  Her goals are be married, have children, and be some work superstar.  She wants to have this kid and then run off and leave her husband to take care of all the busy work.

Her partner is likely facing the toughest period of his life and her response is to spring a child on him, when OP decides that's not in his best interest she guilt trips him and withdraws sexually.  Thus creating even more stress for OP.  It would seriously take a lot that OP isn't telling us to make this woman a loving partner."
675,"Generally, dating *is literally* hanging out to get to know someone to find out if you want to be in a relationship with him.  It's fine if you want to put off kissing or any other physical interaction, but getting on a dating site and insisting that you're going to be Just friends as a ""test"" to see if you're interested enough to date them is not going to net you a lot of interest.

I'm curious as to how you define a date.  Is it the physical actions of kissing, holding hands, etc?  Is it calling each other boyfriend and girlfriend?  

And how long are you talking about an enforced not dating?  A few not-dates is one thing, but to keep a potential date on the hook for weeks to months just *evaluating* if you want to date him- not officially in a relationship, but a test to see if you want to try to see if you two want to be in a relationship - is going to make people feel led on.

Now - you should absolutely not, in any way, ever be pressured by anyone into doing anything you don't want to do, so the fact that these men aren't respecting your boundaries is bad.  But if you're enforcing this ""We are going to be JUST FRIENDS until I find you worthy to go on a date with"" harshly, you may be driving away guys who would be more willing to give you a chance.

What I would do is ask someone you trust to go over your dating profile with you and make sure there's nothing there that sends the wrong message, and make sure that your profile makes it clear that you're going to take things very slowly, and you won't consider any sort of kissing, making out, etc at first.  And you'll know that any guy that crosses that line didn't pay attention to your profile and isn't worth any more time than it takes to block him."
676,So it was a factor outside their control (finance); they didn't dislike each other... 
677,The kid calls her mrs. ___ in what world is that not cold? 
678,Tell your parents to cut her off too when you get home. 
679,Yeah good idea on blocking him. This guy seems fucking weird and creepy.
680,"Lol, I did not propose but the plot thickens! I gave it to him because he did with a ring about 2 months before that. I left the ring with him and never tried to claim it.

684,"Be blunt with him and tell him that your workplace and events are more formal than what he's used to, so his wardrobe needs an upgrade.  Then take him shopping so that way you'll know he has a couple of work event appropriate outfits to wear.  Be clear with him about exactly what to wear to these things and that even if you don't care what he wears in ""real life"", his appearance at these events reflects on you so he has to dress up for them.

685,"How incredibly unfair to your current girlfriend. Break up with her so she can be happy with someone that puts her first.

687,"*empathize 

I think your advice isn't bad, but the OP will likely take it and not do it naturally. I doubt she will address the underlying issue of *why* she is not as close to her son and his wife, and will instead complain about the natural consequences of that in her conversations with her son.

She'll go in with expectations about photos instead of going in because she honestly cares about her son and his family in general."
688,"I see. It's unfortunate that you don't have an agency contact to help with the process. In that case I think you're right, going home sounds like the best option, unless you can somehow quickly arrange another placement through the same website or a different au pair agency. 

What is weird here as well is that these people have 2 normal well-behaved sons who they have been able to raise OK, and yet for some reason they are completely spoiling and screwing up their daughter. Anyway, that's not your problem though. But one thought I had was is it possible that this is not just bad behaviour but some form of developmental delay or health issue or intellectual disability or autism etc etc which is contributing to her behaviour? You shouldn't say that to the parents though.

I think your instinct to keep things professional and polite is right. Schedule a time to speak to both of them. Say that you've decided that unfortunately you are not a good fit for their family and that your ideas of child rearing and appropriate discipline and behaviour differ from theirs. Tell them you are prepared to give them a reasonable notice period so they can find substitute child care (I would say a max of maybe 2 weeks seems reasonable) and then you will go home - that will also give you time to book a flight and maybe even start looking for jobs back home online. Don't let yourself be drawn into an argument about their daughter's behaviour and whether it is appropriate or not. If they start getting angry or arguing just say ""I understand that's your view and that's why I don't think I am a good fit here and am not equipped to take care of your daughter"". Be prepared d they get angry and don't want a noice period, then you might have to go home at short notice, like maybe the next day, but hopefully they won't be unreasonable like that. It's possible that your wanting to leave will make a light go on in their heads that their daughter's behaviour is really extreme and not normal and they will agree to make changes but I wouldn't count on it, and you should go in not requesting changes but presenting it as a decision you have already made to leave."
689,She sets boundaries and grandma OP HAAAATES it 
690,"Honestly, based on what you're saying, some of the onus is on you here. If you valued these animals and got them together, you should have participated in learning about their husbandry and made sure the tank was set up correctly and maintained. It is not as simple as putting the fish into water and running a filter. At the beginning, you need to kickstart the nitrogen cycle with ammonia (before adding your fish) or you must very carefully monitor the ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels. This process takes many weeks to months to stabilize, and it would have been obvious if she were keeping up with it. When I started my tanks I had testing kits out all the time and got very excited when the levels changed to indicate progress. I think the root of the problem is a mutual lack of understanding about what these animals need to thrive, and while it's easy to put all the blame on your girlfriend, this is something you did together. 

Whether or not your girlfriend's bad habits have caused you to lose respect for her is another issue. "
691,Bang. There's your response
692,"So I went through your r/TalesFromYourServer and r/OffMyChest and agree that these people are two-faced and whatnot which makes it difficult to work with them.

But for some of the other things, like the fraternization between managers and servers, why do you care? Do you *really* have such an issue with them drinking wine in the parking lot nearby that you feel you need to report them to the GM/HR? Like yeah, the GM isn't doing their job about enforcing the rules but that doesn't mean you need to do it for them. 

I think your frustration with your fake coworkers are really shortening your fuse when it comes to other things. Don't go and blow up about the stupid and meaningless shit. Just focus on your job, cut contact with these fake coworkers to just professional interactions, and work in improving your skills in this environment. "

694,"&gt; Am I making this a bigger deal than it is? Should I let it go? Would you tolerate this kind of behavior? How would you handle it? Was this crossing the line so much that I should severely limit interactions with her?

I would say yes; it seems like a harmless question because she has no idea why you don't talk to your mother. 

&gt; He thinks I should let it go, but also respects that I don’t want to interact with her or see her. 

You have a good BF who gave his opinion and lets you handle it the best way you see it.

If you see a future with this guy and if you want to have a relationship with his family, then it is best to clear it out with his mother. Confront her and give her the truth if need be. It sounds like asking about your relationship with your mother triggers you for reasons only understood by you. You might want to think about that because I don't know if you would be comfortable with talking to anyone about your relationship with your mother. "
695,"i know how you feel, i got shit from my roommates too about being ""loud"" at normal hours of the day. I simply told them its extremely unreasonable as i have shit to get done and if they want to stay up late then thats their problem and not mine. I suggested ear plugs and they turned it down and then i said ""noise"" hours are 10am till 10:30pm and if they don't like it well too bad.

In your case i'd highly push ear plugs because in your case someone is always gonna be asleep and i think its not fair if they get to be noisy when you are sleeping and you have to be quiet when they are.

Also if its worth pushing that they get a bigger room plus their own ensuite and you have to be careful when using your own bathroom too."
696,"If he shoved her out of the way *during* the fight and she accidentally got hurt, I might agree.

701,"I second this suggestion. This subreddit is not the place for this question/situation. 

Society still hangs onto some strange interpretations of step-parenthood; we're expected to love the kids as our own, but not too much because you'll be seen as overbearing. You're expected to make all the sacrifices as a parent, but get none of the respect or authority. You're supposed to endure isolation, humiliation and abuse, but if you show any emotion about it, you're overreacting.

If your spouses' ex is hostile and attempting parental alienation, that throws a whole other can of worms into the situation that can make it impossible to forge a relationship with the children. If the non-custodial parent parents out of guilt (Disneyland Dad/Mom), that gives the children power in the home. These are very dysfunctional, yet common, scenarios that play out in families everywhere. 

Being a stepparent, especially a stepmother, is the single most difficult position in the family structure. There is a reason many stepmoms develop clinical depression. They can never win unless they have full 100% support from the spouse. You two will need to find a therapist that specializes in blended/step families to help you guys navigate these very difficult emotions. You also need to come together to create a parenting plan that respects your role in the family and lays out expectations/responsibilities/consequences. 

Again, don't look for advice in this subreddit. Entirely too many emotional responses with very little experience with the realities of being a step-parent."

712,"I think it couples with the ""suddenly you're exotic and special"" phenomenon u/glassisnotglass described below.  Some Westerners in Asia have the sense to get over themselves and understand it's a novelty thing.  But other Westerners, especially people who are already insecure or maybe felt uncool back home, take it as personal validation and build their whole self-image around being The Cool Unique World Traveler.  They delusionally consider themselves ""superior"" which goes hand-in-hand with considering the country they've moved to ""inferior."" They might complain about the infrastructure or language or etiquette, but they sure won't give up that sweet, sweet attention they get.

I feel like OP needs to introduce Cassie to the ""Charisma Man"" comics, not quite the same situation as it's about a white guy in Japan, but it skewers more or less the same attitude.  In fact I would just start calling her Charisma Woman whenever she starts up with her ""special insights"" about Asia.  If Cassie can't be corrected, maybe they can embarrass her into shutting up."

It isn't unknown for there to be women out there who have no clue how to cook, clean and be adults.  But they seem to pop up a lot less often than men.

Ask that he be a little more careful next time.

That said, a persistent bloody discharge that is also smelly isn't a good sign.  Apart from the breakthrough bleeding which sounds hormonal, you may have a bacterial infection.

&gt; I'm a little jealous/envious/worried because her ex is in their friendship group, he lives down the road and all her family are still kind of friends with him.

750,"Well, you can stop asking if people ""are okay?"" a lot.  I understand that you're doing this from ""a place of caring"", but what it really comes down to is a self-esteem thing, and an inability to handle thinking they might be mad at you or you did something wrong.  

What the reality of this behavior means is that you're basically constantly turning someone else's bad mood around to make things about you again - because what you really want to know is if you did something wrong or if their reason will make you feel better about them feeling bad.  It's basically a self-centric self-esteem thing and a lot of people aren't going to like it.  

I can confirm that as a guy, a girlfriend who asks ""Are you okay?"" constantly is legit one of the most obnoxious ""small things"" ever for that exact reason.  

On the flip side, it sounds like your boyfriend is communicating his irritation with your behavior in a really immature / aggressive fashion.  Since we can't fix your boyfriend's behaviors here, though, you should concentrate on just letting people have bad moods and allow it to be about them.  If you want to do something nice to make them feel better, just do it.  If they want to be left alone, leave them alone.  If they don't say thank you, don't start a big fight about it - they're already pissed and you'll just make it worse.  

Still though, boyfriend should be mature enough to handle this without lashing out and you shouldn't have to be afraid to say something (even if it's an obnoxious something) in his presence.  "

Is like he was saying ""my ex complained about this and that, couldn't do this and that, but YOU can, right?""  

Kind of normalizing his expectations onto me, if that makes sense. Of course he would explain them in a way that wouldn't make him terribly unreasonable. He was manipulative tho. And I don't know OP's boyfriend so he may as well be kind of dumb but this kind of reminded me of that. "

A consenting adult who wants to put a diaper on in private but OTHERWISE functions totally normally and has healthy social interactions is just a healthy person with an odd fetish.

So, whenever you have these guilty thoughts, like ""I should call my mom for Mother's day."" ""My dad should meet my child."", try replacing the titles for the title, ""Aubuser"". It more accurately describes their role at this point. The thought ""I should call my abuser for Mother's day."" Or ""My abuser should meet my child."" becomes so clearly wrong and absurd. It also makes your decisions very clear and should help you work on the guilt. This may take practice, but it should help.

Maybe its the ""primal"" nature or what have you, and maybe or maybe not the sex addiction is tied in, I'd assume it exacerbates the situation. 

That or he is just straight up way freakier than you ever knew. Sex and porn addiction is a slippery slope, even more so in tandem. 

My advice, if you honestly love the man and want to fix things, speak to him calmly and rationally about what you found, he will probably be mad, maybe even irrationally angry. Accept that the snooping was wrong of you, admit it freely, and try and work towards therapy as a resolution. Good luck. "

773,"&gt; Wedding season is like what, 2 months of the year? Her setting a wedding date 2 weeks before yours is not stealing your thunder at all. Even one week before should not be an issue. If her wedding was on the same weekend as yours, then you would have a reason to complain.

Pretty sure ""wedding season"" can run from April through September (or later, depending on where you are). Her setting a date 2 weeks before is absolutely stealing her thunder in many ways, just more passive-aggressively rather than overtly.

&gt;She said it is going to be a city hall wedding. These are not extravagant nor do they usually have a big guest list. This is the exact opposite of what a ""thunder-stealing"" bride would do. If she was really trying to one-up you, she would be going all-out for her wedding, not having a small ceremony at city hall.

This is not necessarily the case *at all.* The timing of it equates to a base level of thunder stealing. The mere fact that friends are going to have to make the time and take the effort to celebrate merely 2 weeks before is thunder stealing. 

&gt;Her co-workers are teasing her about not being married. 

OP explicitly states:

&gt;she **felt** that her female co-workers made fun of her

*Emphasis mine.* This could or could not be an accurate perception by OPs friend, and given OPs friend's unhinged behavior, I would err on the side of caution and say OPs friend is probably envisioning slights where they are not.

You make him call you Mrs. X. Are you his teacher? Some random lady at church who is always telling him to be quiet or settle down? You are entirely responsible for the fact that there is coldness and formality between you and this child. It is your responsibility to nurture affection. You are supposed to be an adult. You don't put the onus of affection and building a relationship on a 7 year old. I hate to see what happens when that baby prefers to be held and picked up by its father and not you. Then I'm sure it'll be the babies fault that it didn't bond to you.

You minimize the fact that you forgot him in a prayer, like it's no big deal. The fact that you are praying out loud and making your husband pray with you is indicative that your religion and prayer are important things in your life. And you're trying to play this off as you simply forgot? I don't buy that and rightly so neither does your husband. 

You resent this kid and it's obvious from the way you wrote your OP and your comments. Honestly I think they only reason your husband hasn't divorced you yet is because you're knocked up. You're playing this off as if it's a cultural thing and therefore is all correct and fine. When clearly it's not. You're husband is taking steps to divorce you. That is the only reason to get a post-nupt. He's telling you he's not there yet to get an upper hand. Instead of arguing with everyone here about how your ""culture"" (let me guess Bible Belt south?) is right about this situation maybe you should take their advice and try and change things about your attitude. And try it before you are a divorced single mom trying to find someone to love your kid.

775,"&gt;we had an immediate connection and fell for each other very quickly

*You* had an immediate connection?  Or *he* immediately lovebombed you?  

&gt;So, we keep in contact, texting and calling because we can't do no contact apparently. 

*You* can't do no-contact, or *he* refuses to?  

&gt;he hasn't seen her since 6 months before we met

Do you have any confirmation of this besides his word?

Based on this post I'm picturing a lot of manipulation on his part, but that may be an unfair assumption.
"
776,"&gt;  I decided to tell my mum so she wasn't blind-sided, and she completely lost it with me, saying that it was my fault that all the medication would be cut off and all the bad druggies will come and get her if they find out it was me. 

I hope I'm not the only person who's mentioning that you need to take what your mom just said seriously.... also, whatever ""protective"" nature you might think your mom has... assume she doesn't. Now, she's just a junkie who lost her connect and *knows who did it.* All it takes is her tweaking out about it to her (most likely) loser friends, and you could be in serious trouble. Do you have somewhere to stay?"
777,"I would care way more about professional dress at a work function than a wedding. A wedding is an event where he will just look like a jackass, but someone probably has a little brother or 19-year-old boyfriend who is also dressed like a jackass. Whatever. But having the people you work with look down on you affects their perceptions of your professionalism and future prospects.

I really didn't understand how much workplace clothing mattered until I read a comment in a law-oriented clothing blog where someone pointed out that a dress + short coat makes you look like a secretary. Because a professional should have the good fucking sense to realize shorter skirt = longer coat that fully covers it."
778,"The relationship won't survive long-term unless you guys get back to a point where you're equal partners. Subordinating herself out of obligation and guilt isn't sustainable. Eventually it will make her miserable and resentful.

Stop taking advantage of the boundaries she's relaxed, and make it clear that you need the relationship to be healthy far more than you need her to atone for the past. If you can't get her to understand that then she probably needs to talk about it with her therapist."
779,Tell her she's a fucking moron and smile and nod politely when she eventually reveals to you that she contracted syphilis
780,"I think you were out of line, and she fumbled because of that. Honestly, I would have been annoyed at a guy questioning me when he doesn't want to date me exclusively. Even if I agreed to the arrangement. By the rules, she's not having sex with anyone else. And you said it was in her photos, so it wasn't necessarily received that day either.

I think, if you still want to see her, you should ask to date her exclusively and talk about each of your boundaries. Then see if it goes anywhere and date/sleep with other people if it doesn't work out."
781,"You found a bonafide, genuine, real-deal sociopath. You didn't do anything wrong, you're not a crazy person. And there's nothing to salvage, do yourself a favor and don't even try. "

He's stolen your pills and lied to you since before you were married.  He's asked you to not talk to anyone about what's going on.  He's upset that you won't reconcile right away and is acting like you're a bad person when you don't have an answer for him about ever earning your trust back.  And then he has the gall to act offended when you aren't sure if divorce is on the table or not.

All this, after letting you believe it was friends, family, other people stealing the pills.  After he let you marry him never knowing the truth.  After he let you get to the point that you doubted your own mental sanity!!"

784,You are in the worst scenario.  This is an abused child who is about to go to foster care.
785,"The kid's mom's actions led to this situation in the first place; that's what they have to do with this. OP is willing to deal with the consequences of her actions since she can't, but under the condition that this can't happen again. He is looking out for the future, and trying to make sure if he takes a first, there won't be a second child he has to take care of that isn't his. You don't want to say whether or not you think he'd be responsible for another, but that is *exactly* what he is worried about and it's well within the realm of possibility. There is absolutely nothing to prevent this situation from happening again, and you don't want to address that possibility but he does, since he would again be looked to to provide. The grandparents' money is important, because their excuse for not taking the child is ""we're too old"", but they have means to help OP and his family stay on track for their plans if they do take the kid in.  

The obligation of keeping a child out of foster care falls on the parents; why are they *obligated* to take care of someone else's kid?"
786,"Going in person is definitely the right move. Unfortunately, he's not a child or he might be likely to get more help from the police."
787,"This is all pretty normal stuff, and I come from a liberal, first-name-using family. Different people have different norms, and this is all stuff you'll come across in future relationships too. You have to decide whether it's more important to do some annoying stuff that you don't agree with but also doesn't harm you in order to get along with the family, or whether you want to always do things the way you've done them (hint: If you choose the second option, you're likely going to struggle in future relationships too. Relationships are about sometimes having to sacrifice small battles for the larger goals of the relationship, such as having a pleasant relationship with your partner's family.)

Before meeting a boyfriend's family, I ask whether to address his parents by their first name or Mr. and Mrs. Whatever. It's awkward being more formal, but it's important to them so it's not worth fighting. For some families, younger generations using first names is seen as rude or impertinent, and it sounds like your boyfriend's family is like that. You don't have to like it, but it's not something that's going to change and it's better to just respect it.

As far as church, if your boyfriend's family goes to church together, as a guest it's your job to suck it up and go to church with him. You can tune out and make up funny stories in your head about the other attendees, or wear a watch and play ""guess how much time has passed since I last checked the time,"" or whatever else, but again it's about it being the price you pay to fit in with his family. I'm an atheist, but if my boyfriend's family gets decked out in their Sunday best to go to church, I'll drag myself out of bed at the crack of dawn to go too.

For the separate rooms, this is pretty common and is unlikely to change until you've been married. Deal with it or start paying for a hotel room with your boyfriend.

I can't find a nice way to say this last thing, so I'll be blunt: You're coming across very entitled and young in this post, especially pointedly using your boyfriend's mom's first name. That kind of insistence that everything adhere to your way of doing things isn't going to serve you well in life and it will definitely cause problems in relationships and jobs. You can be yourself without being stubborn and abrasive and that's definitely worth working on."
788,"&gt; Is she right?

No, you're right.  Good criticism is constructive, starts and ends on a positive note, is rare compared to the amount of praise that comes from that same source, and is withheld in situations where it's likely to be a one-off.  What you're getting is not constructive criticism; it's inconsiderate off-loading of your girlfriend's frustrations.   And it's not how someone usually treats someone they love.  It's a pretty big red flag for where she is in this relationship, and if you want it to change you better tell her so.

&gt;Internally, I simply wanted to say ""Next time, hang it up yourself.""

This is the right thing if your girlfriend is a generally warm-hearted person who has had a rough day and acting out, and needs a quick reminder to brighten up.  It's not the right thing for a pattern of behavior; it just helps her pick the fight that she's raring to have.    

Instead, you need to sit her down when she's in a good mood - not when she's picky - and explain to her how unacceptable this is, how you feel devalued, how it makes you feel she doesn't care about your feelings.

Listen carefully to what she says back.  She may actually be telling you that she doesn't care about your feelings.  If that's what you hear, no amount of conversations are going to fix it."
789,"&gt; He's not trying to be abusive towards you

I dunno, throwing a plate because she was crying  is a pretty strong statement."
790,"And anytime I see a post with the woman being shitty, all I see are comments telling the guy to leave and that she is abusive. So I don't know what this guy is going on about "
791,"I won't debate whether or not strip clubs are acceptable in relationships, because that's not the issue here.

You had a clearly defined (I assume) boundary that for you, this was unacceptable. He violated said boundary, gave excuses, won't apologise, tried to manipulate you into letting it go.

Honestly, this is completely acceptable reason to break up with him - not because of the strip club, but because he's not respecting you and your feelings.

Also, the fact that he's doing this all over text is kinda odd. This seems like a face to face conversation. "
792,There are ways to talk to a spouse that aren't corrective. You get to talk to him even if he hasn't done something wrong.
793,"She's giving off that vibe because the preeminent conservative political party is giving off that vibe. 

Mainstream conservatives have aligned themselves with the fringes to great benefit to themselves, if you're embarrassed about your bedfellows then get out of the bed. "
794,"Well, jeez. Why can you not bring your fiance with you? Sounds like a great day at the park, hanging out...

Yeah, I get that there's an underlying issue, but really, there are two or three. Most of the married people I know have friends together - even if it's one person's friend or the other, they can still spend time with the person *as a couple* and have everything be pleasant and friendly and cool. I know that as a single person, if I'm getting together with someone and they bring their partner, I'm neither surprised nor upset by it. Why... does that not seem to be a workable dynamic for you here? (Not suggesting it's a bad or good thing, just something to examine.)

"
795,"She says she's not feeling well or didn't sleep well. Understandable but she texts me first thing in the morning and our plans aren't until like 6-7pm at night. So my thinking is maybe go on with the day and maybe you'll feel fine later on? plus our plans aren't anything special other than sit at a dive restaurant for a couple hours and go our separate ways after. One time it was because she forgot she had plans with her friend.  

"
796,"You need to be direct and call her out on it. Don't be passive aggressive or even aggressive. Just ""It's really inconvenient to have to reschedule all the time. What's going on?"""

798,"DO NOT go through with this wedding right now. There are so many things wrong here I can't even count them all.

But overall, and the main thing here: this is not a healthy person you are dealing with. He is not of sound mind to be making a decision about marriage. Even if it *is* the medication (and I don't really buy that) you are much better off postponing the wedding until he's in a better place mentally and physically. Let him get some treatment for a while and then reassess. I'm not saying cancel, necessarily, but postpone.

Don't ask him to start a marathon with a broken leg. You should both be in a much better place mentally before you jump into this.

And maybe some of his anxiety is being caused by the pending wedding?

"
799,"Your 'mock-therapy' session isn't realistic. The therapist is never going to ask you ""why"" you have anxiety. That is THEIR job to figure out. All of your sessions are going to be mutual work and discovery to try to help you better manage your anxiety in the moment and to uncover why it happens. You don't need to go in there with all of the answers. In fact, if you had all of the answers, you wouldn't need therapy.

&gt;I don't really have a reason for feeling the way I do, there's nothing really ""wrong"" with my life.

Having crippling anxiety is wrong enough! Believe me, I see my therapist for much, much less than that. Some people just go for self-improvement purposes. Don't be scared that you're not broken enough. Your therapist is not going to judge you.

&gt;The common advice I see is ""Well, just try out as many therapists as you can until you find the right one"".

Baby steps. One step at a time. Why don't you see one therapist and see what you think. Don't worry about seeing the next four. I think with you the important step is just to talk to somebody and realize that it's not going to be as bad as you think. It literally doesn't matter who that person is at this point.

Here's what you're going to do. You're going to go to Yelp and sort the therapists in your area by ratings. Then you're going to pick the best rated one that deals with anxiety and takes your insurance and call that person. That's how you're going to choose. Just do it today. Brainlessly, using that algorithm. Don't think, just make an appointment. 

And TELL THEM that you are scared to see them. It's okay to let your therapist know that going to therapy gives you anxiety! They can help you with that too."
800,"Not only that, but responsible, well dressed, sexy looking academic doctors are the absolute worst! He probably isn't even interest in all of the tiny town drama.

804,"&gt;Why would it be a bad idea to get your kids together??? 

I mean it's worth asking because these kids might be severely traumatized. With children of divorced parents it's always tricky to introduce new SOs who might not work out, but in this situation it could be a lot worse."
805,"Aww OP, you are in for a rude awakening. There will come the time (maybe in todays argument, maybe tomorrow morning, definitely when she realizes you are serious about breaking up) when she will cry and beg and apologize and promise to change, and judging from your post and your comments, you will be easily manipulated into giving her another chance to change and this ""change"" will last for a little while and you will think things are looking up again when she is only playing the part. Then she will start to fall into her old habits again, abusing you. You will have another talk because it worked ""so well"" (this is so stupid but many people fall for it) last time and the cycle will repeat itself. You will always chase the good times where she played an act. You now know how she really is. This won't just magically change because of some talk."

814,"I'm not disagreeing with you? You don't have to convince me. I get it. I've done it, been the main breadwinner. It *is* a lot of pressure. I have also been solely dependent on someone else for the roof over my head and the food on my table.  It is a stress as well, you lose significant control over your life. 

His stress doesn't absolve him of responsibility for the family he chose to create, the house hold he chose to have. It seems like he understands that, which is why it seems like they are attempting to split that burden equally when both are home.

My point is they might not be doing as good a job of that as they think. Taking on some of the household burden is more than doing a dish here or there. Its taking full responsibility for everything related to that task.

815,This comment needs to be higher up. 
816,Op is family and If she wants to search for her family members who are missing who are you to suggest otherwise wtf? If you ever come up missing make sure to let your family know that only your parent and child has permission to search for you. 
817,"OP isn't married, relationship under 12 months. So many red flags here."
818,"Wow, that last line. Part of me hope I can use it one day to sound cool and all but then I have to consider what kind of situation/relationship did I get myself into in order to say it? Still, pretty cool of a line!"
819,"You can still ask people out. Lots of people don't bring up sex on the first date. Just don't string anyone along to where feelings are involved, cause this could be a deal breaker for some people. It doesn't mean you shouldn't get out there and meet people and enjoy a good date. "
820,"I'm kind of surprised at the amount of people saying you should 100% pay if you want a second date. It might be more common in America, but where I'm from (or maybe just the people I'm exposed to? I come from a progressive environment.), it's common courtesy to split the bill on a date. It's still 'traditional' for the guy to pay the whole thing, but I don't know a single girl who would feel comfortable with that. I'm kind of surprised a woman would refuse a second date if on the first one he didn't pay, haha, I'd love to hear the perspective of any women who feel that way, and why! (Though they might be scared to comment bc they'll likely get downvoted to hell)

There's usually a dance where both people on the date will offer to pay, and then agree to split. It's considered bad manners if either person agrees to let the other one pay the whole thing. Exceptions, of course, being things like if the person you're with doesn't have a job and you take them somewhere expensive, or you already told them it was your treat, or you're establishing a 'taking turns' type thing, etc.

I think your safest bet is to offer, and kind of hope she offers or protests. If she doesn't (or doesn't say something like thank you, next time it's my turn!), then at least you know she's not for you. It's a really unfair double standard that guys are pressured to pay for everything, imo, and I'm sorry for it.

&gt; I don't see why her time is automatically worth more than my time simply because she's a girl. 

I absolutely agree, but the practice didn't come around because society thought women's time was more valuable, it was because women weren't allowed jobs, didn't have their own incomes, and/or were only allowed low paying part time positions, which kind of makes more sense. It's super outdated in our days though.

Good luck on your date!"
821,You either know full well that you were being completely inappropriate with Heidi or your head is incredibly far up your own ass. 
822,"&gt; Heidi didn't seem to be doing it out of spite, she was just trying to connect to my wife.

No, a woman doesn't bring up another woman's dead baby to her to connect, buddy. It was either sheer stupidity (possible) or calculated cruelty (probable). 

&gt; She was pretty upset on her way of packing her things up.

Not sure why this is relevant. Most people don't go skipping out of the office after being fired.

&gt; The word around the office is that she wasn't meeting our standards, was tardy too much, and wasn't a good fit.

What do you want to happen? You had a crappy employee and covered for her because you have feelings for her. But the company figured out she sucks at her job and needs to go. So ... your hot work wife isn't coming back, and your real wife had her suspicions confirmed of your emotional affair. 

As far as next steps - I know everyone thinks this board jumps on the therapy train too often, but I think therapy would be good for at least you because you could learn how to communicate a bit better (which includes listening to your wife's feelings on a pretty serious matter rather than telling her to just relax). "
823,"It'd be one thing if your partners adult child just decided to move in one day because they could and because your partner was coddling them or whatever. That would be some definite ""I didn't sign up for this"". 

But giving your adult child shelter from an abusive relationship is one of those things you'd expect a parent to do. I would definitely do it for my own children, no ifs ands or buts. 

I can understand getting exasperated but at 32 there are much better ways to communicate your frustration. Seconded on the household meeting.

827,"He's the one who didn't want to have a discussion about exclusivity and moving forward with the relationship. He can either be that guy *or* the one who gets upset when you sleep with other people. He can't be both. It sounds like he's about to get his heart broken over you though (not your fault at all, not blaming you) so I think you should slowly cut him out. "
828,"Nerves can be weird. There's a thing called the ""photic sneeze reflex"" where you sneeze when you are suddenly in bright light. My husband and son have it, though I and my daughter do not.

I have Arnold's reflex (not sure exactly what it's called but it's something like that) which means that manual stimulation of that nerve (I believe it's a branch of the vagus nerve) through, for example, cleaning my left ear with a q-tip, makes me cough.

The wikipedia article on the photic sneeze reflex links to one on sexually induced sneezing, which says that nasal decongestants may help. "

Don't tie yourself to a new person so quickly. Try to date for at least 2-3 years before considering spending the rest of forever together. "
837,"Don't accept any gifts from him if he's going to use it against you. Do you have a lock for your door? Can you get one if you don't? If he comes around when your parents arn't there, can you avoid him or leave?

839,"&gt; I'm seeing a lot of ""you need to change what you do""! type advice, based on what dudes need after sex. So, your needs are less important?

I'm also pretty creeped out by some of the comments here. If you're feeling sensitive after sex and don't want to be touched, any touch can feel like a violation. This is a situation that isn't solved by forcing yourself to let your husband touch and grope you in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable. There's nothing wrong with being oversensitive to touch after sex and there's nothing wrong with wanting to cuddle. I agree that there must be some sort of compromise that makes both of them happy, such as what you suggested. "

842,"A child having '2 daddies' and '2 mommies' isn't the worst thing. I'm not a parent, but I can understand how someone can feel territorial over a title.

That said, you guys really need to do some counseling to better verbalize your thoughts and feelings. You also need to hash out what is expected of you as a step parent. 

It would also be good to maybe sit down with his ex and her partner? If your stepson is calling his stepfather 'daddy', but refers to you as ""Mrs. X"", that is probably confusing to him. Also language sends messages. What message does it imply and send to him if he can't refer to you something warmer.

Are you opposed to a nickname? I was raised in the same 'cultural mindset' that you *never* refer to your parents by their first name as it is incredibly disrespectful, but couldn't you two come up with special names? He's 7. Calling you Mrs. X puts you the same level as an unfamiliar, cold, authoritative figure. He probably likens you to a stranger which isn't odd due to infrequent visits and little warm interactions as per your OP. 

And lastly, for your sake, your husband's sake, your stepson's sake, and this new child's sake -- you guys really need to all bond. You need to actively make efforts to form a deeper connection with your stepson. 

He's 7 for christ sake, he's got 11 more years under your roof (at minimum). And it's going to be hard enough on him when you guys introduce the new baby into the mix. Be kind to him. Yeah, you won't love him like your own (and it's not a bad thing), but... It really fucks up kids when dynamics are as wobbly as this one. "

The reasons you're continuing to talk to her are self serving. Apologize for your awful treatment of her then block her. She will move on eventually and find someone awesome who actually does deserve her attention and commitment. "

848,"They're not comparing laundry to working full time, they were using laundry as an example for what ""emotional burden"" is in one scenario. It's not counting everything that a SAH parent might be doing. 

They're pointing out that while it is extremely helpful to the SAH parent for the other to pitch with for chores they shouldn't have to act like their partner's manager for those agreed upon chores to get done. They shouldn't have to keep track of what their working partner is doing or not doing and need to remind them to do their tasks. That's asking the SAH parent to be in charge of completing their own chores, the responsibilities of childcare and the children's schedules and appointments (and possibly keeping track of their spouse's schedule too), and having to check and make sure that their working partner does their agreed upon chores.  The shouldn't have to worry about keeping track of their partner's chores on top of their own. 

As an adult the working partner should know what chores around the house are theirs, how to competently do them, and be able to complete them without having to be reminded that they need to go do it every time. They should be able to get their responsibilities done without having to be asked first. "
849,Right?? Adds a lot to the narrative
850,"They can, but they're a lot harder to do- she'd have to get power of attorney over him for medical decisions, etc. "
851,"It is a really othering thing to do to someone, too. ""You're not me, you're not like her, you're this other thing."""
852,"What she is doing to you is pretty textbook grooming and early sexual abuse--she is testing your boundaries, and then slowly pushing them further. You described pretty clearly that this behavior has been escalating from fairly innocent shoulder rubs to her literally showing you her naked body and touching your groin.

She is getting off on the power. It is NOT NORMAL for a 25 year old woman to be getting this sexually aggressive with a 16 year old boy (let alone her STEP BROTHER. Gross.). 

Imagine if the genders were flipped here and a 25 yr. old man was using his larger physical size to pin his teenage step sister to the floor. Imagine he then whispers in her ear ""I can do anything I want to you."" Do you really not see why people here are super, super concerned by her behavior? It's super...rapey, for lack of a more fitting word.

You seem really resistant to the idea that she is sexually abusing you, despite the fact that she is using her position of power (she's her mother's favorite, she's physically larger than you, and she likely knows she's attractive) to take advantage of you. She knows that you are young and inexperienced and not likely to see this for what it is, and she is using that against you. She is trusting that because she is pretty, you would never report her for this (because everyone would assume you wanted it--this is not the case, by the way, as evidenced here in this post)

You have said that this behavior makes you very uncomfortable, and I don't blame you. Frankly, it made my stomach turn just reading your description. At the very least, this relationship is very inappropriate and involves a serious imbalance of power.

Here is my recommendation: Tell your parents that they can either remove her from the house and force her to start seeing a therapist (because again, let me reiterate: THIS IS NOT NORMAL) OR you will be talking to your school counselor about this. 

Any parent who would rather support the sexual abuser of their child over their child is either being very willfully blind to what is going on, or they are as sick and twisted as the abuser. I'd recommend showing them this post to help illustrate how NOT NORMAL OR FUNNY this is.

It doesn't matter that your step sister is pretty, or popular, or charming. She is also a sexual predator. She is actively grooming her young step brother for sexual contact. If she doesn't realize what she's doing, she needs a SERIOUS wake up call before she ends up on a sex offender list for the rest of her life. If the parents care about either of you, its time they started taking this seriously.

I'm really really sorry this is happening to you--it sounds super confusing and I don't blame you at all for feeling very mixed up about this whole thing right now. Feel free to PM me if you need someone to talk to while you sort this out."
853,"It sounds like in his eyes women are clingy jealous harpies who constantly nag and try to control what their partner does. And since OP acts like a normal mature person should act in a relationship, he thinks he found himself some magic unicorn, the mystical Cool Girl that is happy to talk about girls and doesn't blow up his phone and lets him chill out. I don't doubt that plenty of jealous, controlling women like the above exist (I know a few myself), but most mature people in relationships act like OP does. I think it shows a lack of maturity and/or misogyny on his part."
854,"&gt; [You] Yes they do! [drink place] at 7:45 tomorrow. Should give you time to put on your favorite blue dress.

I hate when men do this to me, actually. It's irritating."
855,"I've been in a happy and healthy marriage for 20 years. 

My basic point is him repeatedly giving this compliment leaves little room for natural change in the relationship. If she doesn't​want to oogle boobs with him at some point he's going to see her as a ""typical"" woman and he's made it clear that that is a bad thing. 

"
856,Don't feel stupid. People reach out for advice on all sorts of things. In some ways it's a lot easier to ask a stranger because their advice comes from a more objective place than people who know you very well. 
857,"The way he said it was certainly tactless. There are about a million ways to tell your partner something about them is bothering you and he chose the worst possible way. You're right to be upset about how he expressed himself, it would have taken no effort on his part to say ""honestly, it does bother me I'd like to see if there's anything that can be done to manage this"" instead of what he said.

In his defense though, it would be a turn-off to most people to see brownish discharge down there the majority of the time. I think he's wrong for how he expressed himself, but I don't think he's wrong for being being squicked out by it. I'm a guy, but if I had a leaky dick I wouldn't blame my girlfriend for not finding me as sexually desirable until I got it under control.

I think you should tell him how his comments made you feel, and explain that you think it was very callous for him to be so rude about it when he could have been more sympathetic. Aside from that, you kind of have to come to terms with the fact he had a right to be grossed out."
858,"I appreciate you responding. I'm going to change my question though, because this is more important: what does he bring to the table? What does he do *for you*?

Relationships are partnerships. You should be equals, making each other happy, keeping each other steady. Think of it like two vines planted next to each other: individual vines, but growing stronger together.

From what I've read so far, everything in this relationship is about what *you* can do for *him*, not what you *both* can do for *each other*. You aren't growing together. He's holding you back."

860,"This is such a great analogy, and I never thought I'd say that about anything involving cupcakes and punching cats!"
861,"Ask yourself who is raising your child. Is it you and your husband or is it your husband and his mother? 


Regrets are a part of life. He isn't stupid enough to be unaware of the fact that his parents will die one day. Your kid loves his parents because they get him get away with bad habits and bullshit which you're not ok with. It's up to **you** if you want to allow it or not, not your mother in law. "
862,"Other room is bigger and clearly better. Still you pay the same rent. Yeah, you are not going to return to the old situation amicably. You could try making the deal more fair to her by for example paying rent according to the room size."
863,"Not being in a relationship until you can get your emotions in check. On the relationship training isn't/won't work for you. Therapy, rinse and repeat."
864,"I...what? She did some things that are really quite dangerous and no, not normal tourist behavior, even now. I've traveled extensively and worked in Italy as a translator during college, and no, it is NOT a good idea to go home with people you don't know in a country where you don't speak the language and have no safety net. 

What's with the chip on your shoulder? 
"
865,"Yes, you should cancel the wedding. Your girlfriend clearly does not know what she wants, and there's no sense in further entangling your lives before she figures that out. Divorce is an expensive and time consuming process, so put the brakes on until you figure out if you're staying together. Her changing her mind every 12-24 hours is a big red flag."
866,"Repeat after me: YOU DO NOT OWE ANYONE ANYTHING.  Just because he spent money, it does not make him *entitled* to anything.  Spending money was his choice - if he only did it to get close to you, that's his problem. **Not. Yours.**

Tell Ric ""Like I have said many times before, I do not want any sort of relationship with you.  By not respecting me, you have only proved that you still haven't changed, and you're still not a person I want to be with.  If what you want to talk about is about anything besides this, we can talk.  But I swear to you, if this is about getting back together, I will stand up and leave and block all of your contact info ON THE SPOT.  So let me ask you this: do you still want to talk to me, or would you rather head home with what little dignity you have?"""
867,"So he just wanted to do a price comparison on prostitutes for the funsies? And he didn't have a story until he figured out what you were upset about? He obviously and absolutely was either going to do it and chickened out or did do it. There's a very good chance that your ex had unprotected sex with a prostitute and continued to have sex with you. Do you think he asked *her* to provide evidence of clean testing? No, he's a liar, a manipulator, a gas lighter and an abuser. He's trying to make you think you're crazy for thinking he was patronizing a prostitutes when you saw messages of him getting price comparisons for prostitutes! That's next level abuse, please run, don't walk. "
868,"I mean, have they apologized yet and made a genuine effort to reconnect on good terms?  If not, you did the right thing."
869,"Move out, and smoke weed in a place you pay for."
870,"If you are dealing with a near stalking situation, you have to share evidence no matter how ridiculous or ""poorly done""

If anything, they would prove her instability extremely quickly."
871,"Thank you! It is creepy! I think the envelope was posted directly from the Dorchester, so the postmark doesn't help. £400 for a meal for someone to be a little disrespectful? I'm thinking of calling the Dorchester again to try and get some information out of them, any ideas of what I can say before I say the police thing?"
872,"Okay, has the husband ever even talked to you guys about a poly relationship? I'm so confused. Why would you just randomly ask if he'd be open to that? That's so weird. Definitely do not do that. "
873,"Well, did this cousin invite plus ones to anyone else in the family? Have you talked to this cousin about how important it is for your bf to be there with you? If they unfairly left out your bf for some reason, that'd be one thing. But if they want to keep the wedding small and didn't invite plus-ones of anyone else, then you come off as much more unreasonable IMO. "
874,"I don't think you should be angry either, but I also think it's totally fair if you don't want to go - you say you're not close with her, and you won't be able to bring your partner along to keep you company so it might just be a boring evening. Your cousin is obviously trying to keep it a small event, and she'll probably prefer to spend time with friends she's invited rather than feeling obligated to talk to you when you're not close. It's possible she felt pressured into inviting extended family she wasn't close with. I mean I don't really know, maybe she feels closer to you than you made it sound and she really does want you there but doesn't want a bunch of strangers (i.e. plus ones)...either way, I'd say definitely don't be angry, but decide for yourself whether or not you feel like it's worth it to you to go. "
875,Have you talk to him about this. A simple conversation about this could solve everything. 
876,"As others have said, this is a bigger issue if his pride &amp; need to pay 50% remains. You don't want a partner that always feels lesser than you because he earns less money, or one that limits your opportunities to those he can afford on his own salary. It's good that he doesn't want to take advantage of you, obviously, but at some point, you're both going to need a team mindset that you're using your joint resources to create the best life for you as a couple. If he keeps this mindset, you may miss out on things like vacations your family pays for, weddings he can't afford to travel to, nice date nights, etc. "

878,"&gt;Is this a common thing that they expect you to change your plans at the last minute? If so, then it would be reasonable to push back and let them know you aren't going to change your plans. 

It's pretty much this. I end up changing my plans, building up resentment and feeling crap. I've worked hard to stop this cycle.

&gt;If this is a one-time thing where they had made other plans that fell through, it would be the nice, familial thing to do to help them out.  

Agreed. If they respect my boundaries and this happens once in a while, I love chilling with my brother. "
879,"Um, obtaining one in what way? Is he buying one? Booking one for a shipment?

If he's buying one, you call one place, get a delivered price, then call two more places to price shop and you're done (done this before).

If he's booking one, you contact your freight forwarder and they arrange it (this is my job). Or, if this is the first time he's doing this and doesn't have a freight forwarder, you contact 3 to compare prices and take the best one. Can 100% be completed by email and doesn't take up a lot of time."
880,"Ohhhh OK. Well. I'm sorry if I'm being critical of you. Honestly, your biggest problem is that you're a nice person. You've already tried communicating with her and she doesn't want to have any of it. Your only option at this point ia to be direct and blunt - and commit to consequences if she can't respect your space. I know you don't want to be mean to her, but do you deserve her bullshit that guilts you into sticking around?"
