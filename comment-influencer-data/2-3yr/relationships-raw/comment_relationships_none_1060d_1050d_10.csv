0,"Good riddance to the turd boyfriend. I mean seriously, he really thinks calling you a b**** is going to make you go ""omg, you're so right honey!  I love you!"" Urgh."
1,"There is no way for this relationship to happen, ever. Twin Sister will not betray your wife, and if she did, the resulting fallout wouldn't be worth sticking around for. You can stay and keep your mouth shut, or leave and keep your mouth shut, but it would be a TERRIBLE idea to let this information come to light. It will destroy your family. Get over it. "
2,"It's normal if you're okay with it. It's not normal if you're not. If you need to establish boundaries with your husband, do it. If he doesn't respect them, that's sexual assault. Doesn't matter how old he is, or how old you are, or if you're married, or whatever."
3,"Is it really so bad that he wants his wife to have friends?

Being a person's only emotional outlet and support can be massively draining. "
4,"Isn't he going to be unable to continue to live there when you leave? Why not evict him and get a roommate who isn't both a drain and damage. Why should you have to leave your lovely home and neighborhood if he's not going to be able to stay in the home? Your neighbors will like you a lot better if you get rid of the problem instead of leaving it.

Then consider glancing over the ASPCA's reporting animal cruelty page. While you've been there to pick up the slack, there's no guarantee future roommates will, and you can bet your ass he'll leave the dog to use his home as a toilet. Does the dog even get walked? I don't think there's anything actionable that's transpired so far, but it may be worthwhile to put up a red flag."
5,Then she should be well aware you need time to get over her before you can be her friend.
6,"I don't know that you can jump to, ""It's my fault.""  Even if you do cause some of the problems in your relationship, or most of them, he is still fully responsible for his own actions. Saying ""this is just what happens"" about such a low sex drive is just not true, but it sounds like until today he's said that it is about the fighting going on, that he's less interested due to that? It could be true.

Just because you have a mental illness doesn't mean you are the sole cause of problems in the relationship. You need to work on that illness, but generally *both* partners contribute to negative behavior patterns. You might need to consider a couple's counselor as well as treatment for your illness if you want the relationship to survive."
7,"&gt; Why do girls act like this?

Don't go there, man.  You will get eviscerated for sexist bullshit like that.

Either she is being totally unreasonable and you should TALK to her about it calmly when it's not happening, or you aren't giving the whole story.  For example, perhaps because you're taking drugs she is upset. Or because you're taking drugs you aren't fully cognizant of what's actually going on."
8,"&gt; The next time he wants to punish you (ie. hurt you because he's angry and can't control his emotions properly and wants to take it out on you), he could easily pick one of those poor cats up and snap their neck.

This.

I'm sorry OP, but his threats against your cat were never *about* that cat. It was ""I want to exert control over you, so I am going to harm something you love."" Assuming you love your current cats as well, they are not safe from him.

Don't get me wrong, I am not just concerned about your cats. *You* are not safe from him either. But you are a human adult, you can make your own choices about whether or not to put yourself into danger. Your cats don't have that kind of control over their own lives, you are responsible for their well being and you absolutely need to keep them safe.

I know bad relationships are like an addiction. You can know they're bad for you, but you sometimes feel powerless to stay away. But you're *not* powerless. You have the ability and the strength to take control of the situation and walk away. It might be hard, and at first you might find yourself missing him, **but you can do it**! If you stay strong, over time his influence over you will leave your system like a poison, and you'll finally be able to feel healthy again."
9,"I've asked to go with her to sessions and she says okay but it never actually happens.

I'll try rewording my problems like you've said. It's just hard to do when you're upset in the moment."
10,"She's allowed to go out, but so are you. You need to have a conversation about the double standard and just the expected behaviors when you two are out. Like just what you wouldn't be comfortable with and vice versa. But yeah it's definitely not fair to tell someone they can't go out with friends and have friends and party or whatever if that's what they want to do. If it's something you don't like, then you just might not be compatible. "
11,"You're not wrong for feeling whatever you're feeling, but keep a couple things in mind.

1) Her behavior is entirely up to her, and if you get her to change it for you, she will resent you. If she's going to stop getting wasted with her guy friends, it HAS to be her decision. You can tell her how you feel about it, preferably calmly, but you can't ask her to change her ways. It's a one way ticket to singlehood. 

2) Trust is great, but of course alcohol weakens us and makes us do things we wouldn't otherwise do, and honesty and forthrightness tend to go out the window. When someone steps out on a relationship while drunk, it's usually because there's something about that relationship the person isn't happy with, and they're lashing out without thinking about it. So, when she's out with those guys, and she's drunk, and the subject of you comes up, she could either be telling them how awesome and trusting and loving you are and how she could never live without you, or she could be talking about how jealous and domineering and parental you are. One of those things will make it less likely that something will happen between her and some guy, and one will make it more likely.

So really the best thing you can do is calmly express that you want her to know her limits, for her safety more than anything else, but let her know it's her decision and you won't say another word about it. You'll give her the chance to think about it for herself and (hopefully) come to the conclusion that she needs to slow down, plus she'll think you're being real cool about it so when she gets drunk she'll be thinking about how cool you are instead of how annoying you are."
12,"This is where you get controlling. She can't go out with new friends? Why does that bother you?

You need to get to the bottom of why it makes you uncomfortable before you have any hope of addressing it."
13,"Same here. I love my brother. I love all siblings. But the described behavior is just to much for me. Maybe it's normal for them, but I personally had a cringe on my face the entire time reading. A flamethrower would've been nice. Or maybe just a Samsung Galaxy lol"
14,"Not to be cliche, lawyers are good at lying and hiding their trail. Why would his brother take such risk? Trust your instinct. Don't marry him. Go and ask the woman. Just ask to be her friend. Nothing confrontational. "
15,"I would visit /r/alanon and also try to find one of their groups. I'm sure RBN might help, but alcoholism is a totally different ballgame of abuse."
16,"Thank you so much. I really appreciate your comment. You are 100% right, I need to get out. I've saved for 4 months now, and am nowhere near leaving any time soon, but I'll do it. I know I'm in a very emotional state right now, but it's weird how when a stranger tells you something you have thought about before... It makes more sense, you know? Anyway. Thanks a ton. When I do get out, I'll thank you again in my head, kind stranger. "
17,"He shouldn't need telling to do his fair share of the chores, and he certainly doesn't get to not do his fair share simply because he doesn't like the variety of tones you've tried asking in. You are an unpaid cook, cleaner, PA and sex worker. How does that feel?

You already said it - you've done. If you need confirmation here it is."
18,"&gt; However, what I do think is she's being a little elitist and stuck up. What is (to me) weird is the fact that she seems to look down on uneducated, working class people 

I have to be honest and say this is a sentiment I hate. 

Why is it so stuck up to dislike people who are openly racist and have been to prison? "
19,"I think incident two was accidental - the moaning which he asked you to stop doing. If he was getting some kink out of it he wouldn't have asked you to stop. It probably freaked him out and embarrassed him as you're his sister. Hence the avoidance! 

The other two aren't really that weird.

Either way though, you're feeling uncomfortable, and that's not right. Why don't you talk to him?"
20,"It turned out that I wasn't compatible with a friend once. It sucked. That doesn't mean I was in love. I'd be lying if I said I like it, but I understand why we had to go our separate ways, even if I didn't want to admit it at the time. I still don't, and it's been almost a year.

It sucks, but if you were in love and she wasn't and you figured out that it would mess up your friendship to try and remain friends going your separate ways was best for both of you in the long run."
21,"His attitude needs to be addressed by your parents, who are doing the actual parenting.

Every single action that disrespects or harms someone  else needs to have consequences. These consequences need to be enforced. 

As for you, you need to also be enforcing boundaries with your brother. Its difficult when you love him and want to support him even if he is acting out like this but the best way to support him is to let him know that you disapprove of his actions and not tolerate them. Kick him out of your home if he is being inappropriate. Call the police if he refuses. Hang up the phone if he starts cursing you out. 

If he is acting polite and respectful then give him all the love and respect that a sibling deserves but tolerating his bad behavior is showing him that there are no consequences for it, which does more harm than good."
22,"I agree. These people should know why you are standing by your grieving uncle and not them. It might cause one or two to rethink what they're doing and reach out to him in kindness. 

...orrrrr maybe not. But at least you'll have taken a stand. Good for you, OP. "
23,"You messed up, so she broke up with you.

Same thing that I would've done, to be honest. All you can do is take it as a life lesson and try to not make the same stupid mistake in the future.

You're blaming a ""weak mind"" but dude, come on, you're a human being with free will, only person you can blame is yourself. Until you come with terms with that.... Not much I can do for you.

Don't blame your gf, you only have yourself to blame."
24,[deleted]
25,I honestly don't know why I'm uncomfortable. I think part of it was I had a bad childhood and always second guess myself since I didn't have good examples of parenting. 
26,"7 nights a month seems very arbitrary. (Especially since the number of days in a month varies.) I would consider more along the lines of 2 nights a week, one of which has to be Friday or Saturday.

Keep in mind that if you start dating, you will have to adhere to the rules as well, so make sure they make sense to you too.

---

Otherwise, spot on advice from /u/arcxiii "
27,Even better! Seriously.
28,"Hi,

thanks for that. See, if a younger sibling would get married I'd sort of understand that... but it's not. 

Also, even though this definitely doesn't make it sound like it, we usually communicate well. We both agree we weren't ready to get married before, we have a timeline which includes getting engaged before the end of next summer (no, I wouldn't think of doing it anywhere near her brother's wedding), and getting married in summer 2018. If it had been up to me i would've proposed a year ago... We've talked kids, we've talked her being happy for her brother who until 5 years ago had massive problems with stable relationships etc. 

I just don't believe you're right. I'll make sure to ask this outright once she's ready to talk to me, and propose on the spot if that's how she feels. Better go buy a ring at the pond shop :D"
29,"Pretty sure its a troll. Either that or shes just a miserable, angry person regardless of her status as a mother."
30,"Your parents were bad parents. I say this not even considering  what your sister told you on your last conversation, but going by what you said on your original post:

&gt; Our dad traveled a lot for work, and while he was on business trips, our mom would get staggeringly drunk.

Your dad having to travel a lot for work does not make him a bad parent. But continuing to do it while your mom was too drunk to be a responsible adult, does.

You have chosen to forgive them for it. Good for you. She has chosen to not forgive them, and surround herself with people she loves and who have not caused her harm. This is why she spends more time with her in laws. She loves them and there is nothing to forgive them for. I feel I don't really need to explain why her husband wouldn't like your parents.

Now, because you have forgiven your parents, instead of accepting that your sister can't, you just question her decision at every turn. You seem to think you aren't ""taking sides"", but your mind is very much made up, and it shows. 

I may be wrong, but it doesn't look like your sister has pressed you to cut contact with your parents, while it seems like you are pressuring her to allow them back into their lives. You are also presenting yourself as a package deal instead of bothering to see if your sister would want a relationship with you if you were to leave your parents out of the equation - which is ok if it is what you want, but don't be surprised then when you are extended the same treatment as the people who she is actively trying to get away from."
31,It's unbelievable how much denial you're in. 
32,"I don't think you should be so quick to dismiss anxiety as poor work ethic.. 

I struggled with school because of anxiety myself. Before i got medicated and started exercising. I couldn't sit in class without sweating, shaking, getting tunnel vision, feeling paralyzed. It's had to focus in class when you're just trying your best not to break down and cry. Anxiety is a horrible thing. Do you see why someone like this might struggle with classes? 

At least she's still putting in an honest effort and still going to school. It's so easy just to give up and walk away, but she's still there. 

As far as her going out with her friends on the weekends, she's an adult. She deserves to have a life too. Just try to imagine how much worse her anxiety could be if she was unhappy. Loneliness is crippling to someone with anxiety. Being with her friends probably helps her more than you know. It helps me. "
33,BrokenPaw- you always have incredibly insightful advice and it's very enlightening to read.
34,It's your SO's mother. If she's so upset about this why hasn't she asked her mom why you were left out? It's a pretty simple thing to do.
35,"Regarding going to the police: Even if you decide not to go through with pressing charges, it might be worthwhile for the police to have been informed and have a report in case he ever does this to someone else."
36,I'm 30 but I've always wanted to be a flower girl.
37,"Can you get a room somewhere else and sublet your current room? At this point you're going to either lose your friend or your living arrangements, which sucks. She should have been upfront with you about her issues before you moved in together."
38,"It's kind of crazy to expect/request your 22 year old sexually active single roommate to not have sex.  If she can't deal with her roommates getting it in, then she probably needs to live alone.

And don't feel guilty about hanging out with people without her.  Her social life is her responsibility. 

Have you considered she has a crush on you and that's why she freaks out when you have sex with other people?"
39,"I don't know but I giggled when I wrote that post because ""trekken"" is actual Dutch slang for masturbating."
40,Here's a thought. Stop sleeping with guys right off the bat. Ask out guys you are interested in. Be upfront that you're looking for a relationship. 
41,"Please don't feel stupid for wanting to believe the best in a person. Everybody wants to think the people in their lives are good and trustworthy. Sometimes, they just aren't. It's not you, it's his bad.

I'm sorry you have to deal with this."
42,"You need to see a therapist who specializes in battered woman or woman with stockholm syndrome bc you have serious issues in not recognizing how incredibly unhealthy and destructive this relationship is for you.

Not one person on here is going to tell you that your husband's behavior is even remotely ok-let that sink in."
43,I had to look at the ages again to realize that *he* was the 27 year old and *OP* was the 23 year old. Still wanting a hot gamer girl to show off to his buddies(and doing so at Hooter's)? Expecting his SO to read his mind? Moving too fast and seeming to have put OP on a pedestal? Yuck.
44,"The symptoms are all consistent with liver failure.

As the urea builds up you get encephalopathy"

46,"Tattoo laser removal and or a coverup.  
You planned for and got the tattoo behind her back ecause you knew she really wouldn't like it and now you are shocked that she didn't like it. Get rid of the portrait.  
If you still need a tattoo for your daughter maybe talk to your wife about a co promise, maybe your daughter's initials or better yet a simple image like her favourite flower or something from her favourite book or tv show. Something simple and subtle with your wife's approval."
47,Kind of a missed opportunity to put the cat in the purse
48,"Not everyone is cut out to be a caretaker. It might be her brother, but it is also irresponsible of her parents to expect her to be there to babysit whenever they want. 

You may love your job and be grateful, but it is your job. You get paid for taking care of that young man. It is not her job, she doesn't want it to be her job, and she is not paid for doing this job. It might only be a few hours a week, but that can be extremely stressful for people who aren't cut out for or do not want to be involved in healthcare. She has given her parents reasonable information about people whose job it is to care for people who are disabled, and that is fair.

Also, he is larger and faster than she is, it is literally not safe for her to look after him. If he decides to run off, and she can't keep up, it's very unsafe. In a home care company, it would be negligent to put someone who cannot physically keep up with the needs of the patient with that patient. "
49,You say he's your best friend and you also used a condom.  On one hand I can see you not wanting to cause unnecessary drama since you've already decided on abortion but on the other hand he's your best friend and he has no reason to blame you since you took precautions that unfortunately failed.  Why do you think he'll never speak to you again?  Can you stay friends with him while carrying this secret forever?  Give him a chance to be a friend and offer emotional support.   
50,OK so I guess you're going to help OP with her (potentially disabled) child for the next two decades. Oh wait. You're not.
51,"She's 23 and he's older than her dad. Obviously she previously had a certain degree of respect for him, so it's not surprising that 'oh he must be trying to date me, a woman less than half his age' wasn't the first thing to jump into her head."
52,"Are you interested in dating this girl?  Or just being friends?

If you want to date her, you have to make a move, and you may be rejected.  It seems unlikely, because you were basically fixed up with her.  In fact, she's probably wondering why you haven't made a move yet!

If you just want to be friends with her, then you're already on that track.  The ""Friends"" pathway very rarely morphs into the ""dating"" pathway though.  "
53,"Agreed. They could maintain ties, and make it clear that Rachel and OP were friends for a long time, Mike was 100% out of line, and if Mike is coming he better be on his *best* behavior and respectful of their friend. 

Inviting Mike's new girlfriend is tasteless and crossing a huge line. In a lot of weddings, even if no one really knew Mike's ex, something like this would be grounds for removing him from the wedding party and they certainly wouldn't be inviting the new girl. It's absolutely fair to say ""Look, you just ended your marriage in a really nasty way, I don't want my wedding to be all about that- so you're out of the wedding party, you can come as a guest, but don't you *dare* bring your new girlfriend"". 

If I were Rachel, I'd be seriously reconsidering this wedding. That kind of approval for infidelity does *not* bode well."
54,[deleted]
55,"It's not bad for young teenagers like you to begin experimenting with dating and relationships.  The thing is that you should keep it very casual and low-key.  Go out to the movies, hold hands, have a great time, but don't get too invested in thinking you're going to find your forever partner at age 14. Just consider it practice for more serious relationships later.  "
56,I feel like she answered that in the OP. She thought they were friends but has realized they actively avoid her. Obviously not friends after all
57,"Yes, and they are terrible people. Are you a terrible person?

And that said -- if your plan is to just ghost her, OP, you deserve to get kicked out of your house. Imagine you were the one pregnant with this baby, OP. What would you think about the guy who enjoyed sex with you and just checked out leaving you with the responsibility for his and your actions? You'd think he was rotten, right? Because he would be."
58,"Just say sorry, but you can't afford it.  Then bring donuts in once in a while."
59,"You're so collected. If it were me, I can totally see it go down this way:

Her: Your apartment is so ugly.

Me: Your face is ugly and so is your personality."
60,"Three years older than you is not really ""older than you"" when you're as old as you two are.

Also, word to the wise, when a partner gives you a ""rule"" like ""you have to promise me you will never, ever, ever sleep in the guest room"" it's a sign they are really controlling and unreasonable. Like giant red flag. What if you're having a really bad period? Or you're finding it hard to sleep? Or you have the flu? Or you're not tired when he is and you wanna stay up longer and not disturb him. 

He obviously A) has the serious Mommy issues that need to be worked on, B) is super controlling and C) not willing to compromise and has made you think nutso things like ""being 3 years older means he has the right to stay set as he is"" - bonkers. complete rubbish. red flags abound.

Edit: I want to acknowledge that he did give up a lot of his quirks for you (noise machine etc.) to promote the sleeping in the same bed, but how adamant he was about you never sleeping in the guest room is really worrying to me."
61,"It is not an ""A"" or ""B"" situation, you both have blame here.

* Your boyfriend is being a tool for not wanting to help a friend of yours out during an emergency. And he is less than considerate in how he is communicating his feelings.

* You are inconsiderate for inviting a guest to stay without discussing it with the other resident (your boyfriend) first. Part of living together is that you need to communicate and agree upon things that have to do with your household.

You both need to look at this as a lesion in communication. "
62,"Are you sure nothing specific happened that changed her attitude?  The behavior you're describing doesn't sound like she just gradually grew apart from your family from a sense of elitism.  It sounds more like one or more of them may have done something that freaked her out; I'm thinking of something like a sexual assault or harassment.  

Have you actually tried to talk to her heart-to-heart about why she doesn't like them anymore?  A talk where you actually listen to her without judgement?  Because based on your wording in the post, it sounds like you just made assumptions about her reasons and then lectured her about why she was wrong."
63,"Yep. Celiac here, I always bring snacks I can munch on as it's taken years for friends to catch onto ""I can't eat that or I get deathly ill"" 

Luckily my diet is somewhat easy to avoid, for myself. I know what I can and can't eat, and always ask for a rundown of dinner info before attending a gathering. Maybe you should see what else they are having? 

Baked sweet potatoes would be a good way to go! Easy to store, and you can add what you want to make it as unhealthy or healthy as you want. I love the minimalist baker and she has so many good herby/spicy dishes for fall &amp; thanksgiving up from last year that are relatively easy and quick as well! "
64,"I'll be honest and say I think this is quite sweet of him, I think he's just trying to impress you."
65,[deleted]
66,"In your opinion. A lot of people consider banging a friend's ex (even if the friend was a cheater) to be off limits. 

Plus it's much easier to take the moral high ground when you don't know anyone involved and haven't heard the spin both guys will put on this. The friend will have to work very little to get most people on his side once he finds out about OP and his ex. "
67,"The mom didn't have an issue with you changing diapers. She is the sick one who is trying to paint you in this light, distoring your step-kids memories of you.

If possible I'd suggest you try to be around them only when your husband/their dad is too. Just so he can vouch for you in case theor mom goes ape $#!+ with a lawyer."
68,"agreed, but my thinking was to bring it up with her outside of therapy first.

curious why you think it should be raised int he context of a therapist's office? (though thank you for your thoughts regardless)"
69,Yes. I would. Your pets destroyed his property. 
70,"Stand your ground. Your mom might not like it, but she sounds reasonable enough, she's not going to completely blame you if this girl cuts you all off. You make good points about her thinking she can push you around. She *says* being a godmother won't entail anything, but just watch: she's going to try to guilt you into doing all kinds of things with it. She seems the type, and the fact that she didn't have anyone closer to her to ask is verrrrrry telling."
71,"Yeah.. Something tells me he's going to have a lot of issues being attracted to her if she ever starts to get sexually comfortable and explorative. If he freaks out this much over her looking at non-sexual nude pictures, I hope he never catches her watching porn. That poor woman."
72,"I think its a very fine line and a tricky one, but your post is written in a way that you don't sound like an asshole and you genuinely want to have a positive chat with her. In a relationship both partners should feel accepted for who they are and should be able to be comfortable with how they want to dress. But equally showing up to your office to meet all your new colleagues in PJs and a tatty coat isn't massively thoughtful.

Firstly how is she in herself? Is she depressed or down currently? Often if your self esteem falls then so does your attention to how you present yourself. If there is an underlying issue like this then you need to talk to her to address this and get her on the road to recovery.

If its nothing like the above and she has just gotten more and more casual with her dress over the years then why don't you take her shopping? Maybe she hasn't noticed how casual she has got. Treat her, pamper her, make her feel loved and spoiled and get her enjoying making a little more of an effort. Take her out to dinner and give her a reason to want to put some nicer things on. Tread carefully, you don't want her to think you only care about how she looks and that you want a Barbie girlfriend. Just that there is a time and a place for comfy gear, PJs etc but also that it is nice to present yourself well for your partner on other occasions.

Equally I have to say - if you have let things slip too perhaps you can have a joint conversation about how you both need to make more effort and show her what you are doing to up your game too? "
73,"What kind of a person doesnt find glasses adorable? Also OP 

""I want to be dating someone that pushes me to be better, instead of dragging me down. ""

This statement alone is enough for you to find a better partner. "
74,"oh bb, get yourself to a therapist ASAP. You shouldn't have to feel so horribly about yourself. Also, if your current dentist won't give you braces is switching to a different one a possibility?"
75,"We don't know if she's importing it or buying it from some shady local company. Hell, we don't even know if it's banned in her country. 

Plus the law tends to see things differently if you're a desperate cancer patient trying to fix yourself vs. actively preying on the uneducated and desperate."
76,"&gt; But here's what I'm not understanding.

Let me translate it to you: I want to fuck other guys. Oh you're not cool with that? Alright c'ya

&gt; She didn't even give me a concrete reason on why she wants to break up

No, she did. She wants to be poly was the concrete reason and you're not cool with it. "
77,"I unfortunately didn't realize this until recently. I destroyed a relationship by thinking that we always had to be together, and was on the verge of ruining my current one as well. It's tough finding a balance, but after a while I realized that it was *perfectly okay* to be by myself for a while, to do things without my boyfriend, and vice versa.

I used to throw childish tantrums when my boyfriend wouldn't come to bed with me for a few days in a row but I soon realized that not only is that behavior turning him off even if he does come to bed, it was distorting his view of me. (I also came to realize that I actually really love having a whole bed to myself sometimes).

From learning this and maturing, our relationship has strengthened so much. I feel like me again, and he doesn't feel as overwhelmed and pressured. Living your own life is so, so critical."
78,"Fuck this comment is scaring me the most because of how many of those symptoms she has. She's constantly exhausted, depressed, achey, and sometimes has digestive issues. I need to really sit down and compile a list of what you and other posters have suggested. Or maybe I should just sit with her and go through this post together?"
79,"Does he speak to anyone else like that? No?  Well, then that's verbal abuse.  He is being more than disrespectful, he is deliberately saying things that are intended to hurt you and make you stop talking.  He shifts blame onto you and calls you names, while swearing and yelling.

This is verbal abuse.  This is a choice he makes.  Weekly is FAR too often for this to happen.  If he truly knew it was a problem and truly felt bad about it, he would be doing something to change it.  Antidepressants won't fix that.  He needs to go see a counselor and learn healthy ways to manage his stress that don't result in abusing you.

Or...you can leave.  Because you didn't earn this and you don't deserve it.  And it's far too habitual at this point to be anything but abuse."
80,"Abso-fucking-lutely!
What a nasty piece of work MIL is; and that poor child being taken advantage of sickens me.
OP, no contact sounds like a great route if your hubby is on board. His mum, his problem to handle. I hope he sees the severity of this and is just as appalled as you are."
81,"A little late but i hope you see this.

I believe you are SEVERELY underestimating how easy and random it is for a guy to get hard.  Helping you undress when you are freshly heart broken and drunk is just being a good support.  Merely looking at you in a towel while leaving the bathroom has no meaning either... You are being tainted by your imagination surrounding the massage boner.

I suggest you ask /r/sex about that particular situation; they will give a more neutral opinion on the matter.  Here on /r/relationships, everyone suspects everything and people are too quick to assume the worst.

You say your brother has been acting odd towards you?  Dont forget, you have gone from a whatever-level-of-casual relationship you've painted, to living together for several weeks.  Not just that, you are there specifically for emotional support because of the breakup.  Having that much contact with anyone will lead to more bonding and emotional attachment.  Walking around with just a towel, letting him undess you when drunk, and erotic moaning when he offers a massage?  Dont be too quick to judge. With the right spin it could also sound like you're leading him on... 
But we know thats not the case :) have faith in your twin brother and dont let him know you ever suspected anything."

83,"If you're in a situation where you can't choose between two people, it typically means that neither one is right for you.

84,"You have done great things in spite of your father.  And abuse isn't a contest.  (For the record, if it were, you would have me beat).

It's funny, when we grow up immersed in this environment, it seems completely normal.  The exact same thing happened to me when I had my boy - suddenly I realized that I could never treat him the way my parents treated me.  Suddenly I realized I wasn't a bad kid, they were bad people.  It all flip-flopped.

And when he was four, I cut contact as well.  My entire extended family thinks my mother is in the right.  My grandfather beat the shit out of my father, and they are still in contact!  Therefore I should put up with anything less than that.  

If 'forever' sounds too long, aim for 6 months of no contact with your father.  Just 6 months to see how you feel and regroup.  Then at the end of 6 months, reevaluate.

You know your wife better than we do, so you might be able to better decipher the meaning, but keep in mind that that phrase can be interpreted differently because the non-verbal is lost.

I suggest that you approach the issue from a non-combative perspective to attempt to reopen the discussion."
94,"Honestly, big fucking deal. He pulled a bait and switch on two children and betrayed a woman who loved him, I don't want him to have peace and closure. He left so much hurt in his wake and he can only be bothered to reach out for the purpose of his healing? Fuck that. Until now I had assumed he'd already drank himself to death and I was at peace believing that. He doesn't get to disrupt my peace for the sake of his own."
95,"She's 17. You need to start letting her do this now because once she's 18 and in college she'll be doing it anyway. You can't protect her from this, she has to learn to deal with it sooner rather than later. Keeping her from regular teenage activities is stunting her, not helping her."

97,"Seriously. OP lied to her client's face for *months* about something that exposes the client's business to lack of payment or scandal resulting from any potential stupid action on the part of OP's husband. This is a sound business decision, but OP just won't accept that for whatever reason. "
98,"If my experience with family was my brothers beating me up all the time, I wouldn't trust anyone either. Your reaction is understandable.

101,"You and your daughter are a family. Your girlfriend can't be in a relationship just with you, and not your daughter.

I think your girlfriend needs to understand that, and at the moment, she doesn't. It sounds to me like she may not be mature enough to live with a father. If you can't get her to understand that you and your daughter are a package deal, then I don't think she's ready to be in a relationship of this kind."
102,"""Mom, when I am ready to discuss wedding plans with you, I will let you know.  Let's talk about something that's relevant to my life and interests right now.""

If that doesn't work, ""Okay, I can see you'd rather talk about weddings than talk to me.  Unfortunately, I'm just not interested in a one-sided conversation on that subject.  I'll call you back later and see if anything's changed.""  Repeat as necessary - even after you do get engaged."
103,"I work at a grocery store that will ""never knowingly disappoint you."" We regularly give the customer the better end of the deal. Sometimes it's because we feel bad but mostly it's because it's just easier. 

You come to the register with a container of cut fruit from produce that we cut in the store and it doesn't have a label. Well it's priced by weight. Someone has to run their ass back there and get them to weigh it and make a label. And it's the fifth time it's happened today. Fuck it, you get free honeydew melon. 

Someone's returning something and we don't have the original sku or any packaging of any kind that we can use. I'm getting a manager and he's going to pull a price out of his ass. A good price. It's just easier. So eat your free honeydew melon and be happy. Odds are the person who processed it knew that it was probably not what you paid. 

And as others have said, you can get the person in trouble if you make too much noise. "
104,"This is pretty good advice actually. If this feels like it could be long term and stable and good, then tell your friend that you have realized feelings for his sister and you have a pretty good sense that she feels the same and feel him out on the idea. Or she can do this. I don't think you need to tell him you slept with her. I don't think it's the relationship that needs to be awkward, it's the breakup, and the reasons why that will be awkward."

106,Oh come on. We don't know that she is ignoring him and this is massively unfair. The loss of a child is hard on anyone but she is *also* going through physiological changes from the end of a pregnancy. It's cruel to call her selfish for grieving esp when you're making assumptions about the nature of her grieving based on nothing.
107,And what does that look like? You've responded without any specifics. WHAT SHOULD SHE DO?

If it's a matter of wanting to be friends and not knowing how to handle the sexual pressure, that's something else."

112,"I apologize for the wall of text, but this is a very familiar situation to me.

My husband attended his friend's bachelor's party a couple of months before his own. Everybody got sloshed and ended up at a strip club. I let him know at that time that I didn't mind him going along with the crowd, but I would be disappointed if strippers were part of his own bachelor party. I felt it needed saying because his brother (also his best man) is a big fan of strip clubs. He agreed and assured me that he had no interest in going to a strip club when his time came. He's shy and introverted, and I know he meant it at the time. Well, his party comes along and he and his friends spend the day touring craft breweries. Then his buddies decide to take him to a strip club and buy him a lap dance. He's not so good with peer pressure evidently, because he went right along with it.

Having forgotten our previous conversation, my fiance told  me all about it the next day. I was devastated. Part of the problem was that he had done something I consider cheating, even if he just saw it as a performance. Part of the problem is that he participated in sexual acts as a financial transaction, which to my mind devalues our relationship. The fact that his role was passive is a mitigating factor, but it doesn't excuse him. Part of the problem is that he would accept a lap dance from a stripper when I know he never would from a female friend - is he dehumanizing strippers at some level? Honestly though, the biggest offence was that he disrespected our relationship in front of our mutual friends, and they not only approved but also facilitated it. I felt like he had just announced to people I believed were also my friends that he is not fully committed to me, and that they applauded it.

My fiance was incredibly apologetic as soon as he realized how much he hurt me. He was in tears, he cleaned the house and weeded the yard while I took the dog out to get some space, and he gave me a heartfelt apology that proved he understood why I was upset and how deeply he regretted his thoughtlessness. Even so, I had a hard time getting over it until I called a couple of the guys from the party and had my say. One of them just shut down and later apologized to my fiance for getting him in trouble. Hmph. I still haven't forgiven him entirely. The other one was remorseful and upset at himself for not considering my feelings. We're back on good terms again.

Anyhow, my fiance and I got married, things are going great, and he's never done anything to make me doubt him again. I love him completely. It was so, so important to the salvaging of our relationship that he acknowledged why I was upset, accepted culpability, and truly sought forgiveness. If you're having trouble communicating that by yourself, couples counseling may help."
113,"&gt; It's time to block her on your phone, email and social media.

IMO, he should have done that years ago."
114,"Unacceptable behavior. I have ADHD, and it in no way excuses his behavior and pouting. There's not much you CAN do if he's not willing to face his shortcomings.

He uses ADHD as an excuse. It's not one. It's a challenge, and a challenge he's failing to beat.

You can't help people who are unwilling to admit their own shortcomings. As someone with ADHD, I say leave. You're 21. It's not your job or within your abilities to fix him. Go find one of the people that pulls themselves out of their holes instead of saying ""well I'm in a hole, might as well dig."""

116,"&gt;And don't dismissively say this isn't sexism, this is a fetish as if the two are mutually exclusive.

Lol, Don't dismissively call it sexism."
117,Thank you for sharing. It's nice to know that someone else has had a similar experience. I'm sorry that you had to go through it.
118,"Your stepmother knows that if she helps with your wedding, your mother will be upset about it and make you miserable.  And then you'll be upset and you'll ask your stepmother to help fix the mess.  Like others have said, it probably isn't one incident, just a whole bunch of things that make it best if those two women minimize contact with each other.  

You are reasonable in being sad that your stepmother isn't available to help with your wedding.  You are not reasonable in asking your stepmother to talk to your mother and patch things up.  Your stepmother was correct to block your mother across social media.  And while it is rough to be blindsided with this information about animosity now, be thankful that the adults protected you from it when you were a kid.  

Don't uninvite your stepmother from your wedding.  That would be cruel and pretty crazy given what you've said here. 7 months is a long time, your mother will probably calm down quite a bit by then. And if she doesn't, that's on her, not on your stepmother.  

If you can afford it, hire a wedding planner.  But also, while weddings are a lot of work, it is totally doable for a bride and groom to do the research and make the decisions without much family support.  It might be nice to bounce flower choice off of a mother figure, but it is probably easier to just go in, talk to the florist, make some decisions, and move on to the next thing.  You might also consider reaching out to your MIL for a few of the mother things - she might really appreciate it."
119,"Yes, yes. I've experienced this. This comment might sound familiar, because I've shared this part of my past hoping to convince people to not get stuck like I had in the past.

Every time my ex would accused me of cheating (I never did. And never behaved in a way to justify his suspicion) I would snoop and easily find evidence he'd recently cheated on me. 

The reason for the length of the relationship was his physical, emotional, financial and sexual abuse. As well as my fear and codependency.

It's important that OP leave her husband and go no contact. Behavior described is -at minimum- financial abuse and emotional abuse. 


Not losing this current job is important to build and maintain a stable future. Contacting a women's shelter, and arranging to stay there would be hugely helpful. It will keep you physically safe if he seeks to hurt you in revenge for leaving. They will have staff trained to emotionally support you when he lashes out via phone / text /email. They're trained to handle this type of violate awful situation.

After leaving, the book Why Does He Do That by Ludy Bancroft. Please read it. I cannot recommend highly enough."
120,"So it's not ""real sex"" if you don't have an orgasm? If women had this same mentality, it would be *hilarious*

I don't really know very much about how he feels about his mother, and I would be quite the hypocrite to suggest he seek therapy because of their relationship, since I've been estranged from my biological father since I was a kid. 

It would make a lot of sense for those two things to be connected...I don't really know how to bring it up in a constructive way, though. ""Do you still sleep with a blankie at almost 30 because of your mommy issues?"" is hard to sugar coat. "
131,"&gt; Don't put up with that kind of behaviour!! This can become dangerous later on!!!

The thing I don't understand is why you'd put up with that kind of behaviour *even if* it wasn't an indication of an increased likelihood of leading to worse behaviour later on?

What I mean is that -even if there was no correlation between temper and future violence (and I don't doubt that there is)- why the hell would you want to be with an adult who behaves in a manner that you wouldn't accept in a teenager?!?"

133,"&gt; My boyfriend doesn't show any signs of residual trauma from his upbringing. 

&gt;he absolutely hates change of any kind

*This* is a sign of residual trauma from his upbringing. So is his adamant insistence that you sleep in the same bed. It's all attachment/safety stuff. 

That's not to downplay the impact it has on you -- sleep is personal and the bed environment feeling weird and gross is a big deal for you too. But I think the bigger issue here is that he almost certainly has some stuff he hasn't fully dealt with yet, even if you think he seems very well-adjusted. It is in his best interest, and yours, to find him a therapist who can work with him to address these lingering issues, especially if you foresee a future in which you have kids. 

ETA: OP, I don't mean to be short with you, and having read the comments now it's clear that a lot more is going on here. He's hoarding and refusing to let you have some control over the space -- again, more pointers that he is not as well-adjusted as you hope he is. He really needs therapy individually, and if you want it to work you probably need couples counseling as well. But the bottom line is this seems like a basic incompatibility, he doesn't seem adjusted enough to really handle a healthy relationship at the moment, and you may have to draw a line to protect your own health and sanity. That sucks, and I'm really sorry."
134,"You're really obsessing over an unimportant detail with this ""home"" nonsense. I'm 50 and own my own home on the East Coast. My mother still lives in the house in which I spent the first 17 years of my life.

If you really want to make her feel included, stop calling her your ""step-daughter"".  That sounds so alienating. 

Practice what you preach."
135,I'm honestly surprised its not required by the school. My college required us to have health insurance and to waive there's we had to prove we had our own.
136,"Oh let her go, she's old enough to make the decision.  Stop taking it personally.  You should be glad she's being honest.  Let her go maintain the bond she has with that side of the family.  

Think about it like this- do you consider your husband's family *your* family?  Or are they important and nice but definitely not the same tier add your ""real"" family?   It's extremely unlikely that you really do hold the family you've adopted into your life at the same tier as the one you've always known.  

If I had to spend a holiday with my step mom's family I'd be pissed.  Doesn't matter how great they are, it's not the same.  Don't put your feelings above hers, be the adult and understand her rather than being jealous over nothing.  "
137,"Honestly, I admire your sense of morals, but I was only with you until you said you had sex with her and are now seeing her. You dismissed that was your intention citing your healthy sex life in another comment, but all the sex in the world doesn't mean anything if you've developed feelings for someone, which you have openly admitted to doing with her.
  
I'm not attacking you, but I think you need to be truthful with yourself. Are you honestly saying you would have handled it exactly the same if you hadn't have had feelings for her? That you wouldn't have maybe given him an ultimatum or something to that effect, rather than going straight to her after he rebuffed you? If the answer to either of those is yes, I think you need to cool it down slightly.
  
Either way, jumping into a relationship when she was in this vulnerable state wasn't a good idea, both for preserving the friendships you seem to be lamenting the loss of (that seems to be your wish, but I wouldn't bother) and for making sure your future relationship is a healthy one. To be honest, I could see it causing a lot of problems further down the line.

My mental health is better now, I am also a much stronger person.
I don't get as nervous or anxious anymore, the feelings of selfdoubt have ceased.
I used to think that I needed him, that I would melt in to a puddle of misery and loneliness.
I used to think that he was my strength, my rock - but he wasn't; he was the one that was weakening me.

You need to kick him out, or leave - move away, ghost him. Break all contact, it's tough - but this man is no good for you. Can you imagine bringing a child in to the world with a man like that? With one that shows his love like that?"
144,"that's true.. i told him that i'm not upset with him over any of this and that i'm here no matter what happens as long as he remembers that being open and honest are all i ask. i want him to feel safe coming to me, that i wont yell at him, or just throw him from my life, even if he decides he is gay, or doesn't want to date anyone.. or decides hes a giant cucumber i dont know.. as long as he is true to himself thats all i want for him."
145,"""I feel you are prioritizing everyone in your life over me.""

I mean, you two had a pre-existing date, his partner was late, so they could have played 9 holes, but a small plastic ball and his mate came before you.

147,"If she's suicidal then she has her bf to support her now. That's his territory, not yours. Of course you can be supportive as a friend but you are not her main emotional partner anymore - he is. 

This does sound incredibly co-dependent so maybe do some reading up on that to work out your patterns - I'm willing to be they're contributing to your anxiety about all of this. The fact is that you can talk about this til the cows come home but it won't change the fact that it's necessary and that it'll be difficult. The best thing you can do is to get it done. "

Don't over play it and just say that. The more you try to oversell it, the more you're likely to raise doubts from them.

OP should also lock down her social media, because chances are they'll snoop."
150,"Agreed.  It looks to me like he's conditioning her to accept his lies (or at least stop asking about it/pushing him until he tells the truth) by being a jerk about it when she asks and making up some bogus ""I have issues because of my ex so that's why I am a complete jackass to you when you ask me where I am"" just so he *can* start lying about bigger and more important things.  

He's lying about where he is and who he is spending time with.  Last time he lied about being with co-workers and was really with his cousin.  Who is he going to lie about being with next time?  Oh, but don't ask about it, because that's ""checking up on him"" (something normal people do with their partners . . . ) and that's BAD because CRAZY EX!"
151,"Quite honestly your family has no idea what they're talking about.

Your mom had custody of your sister and with her death, legal custody will almost certainly go to her only surviving parent. Your grandmother will have to go to court to get any kind of legal standing at all, which she has a shot at because the child's mother died and the grandmother was involved in the child's life previously. Even then she will more than likely only get some kind of visitation. 

If your sister's dad is smart he will already be in court. "
152,"I think, because of the environment you grew up in, and because you seem like a laid back dude, you're letting this slide. But from an outsider's perspective, she's AT BEST being a jerk and taking advantage of your chill attitude, and at worst, she's trying to get a rise out of you/cause drama. Whatever it is, it's childish, and frankly you're both too old for that bullshit. If this is her behavior at only 3 weeks, imagine how much worse it will get. I would cut it off, personally."
153,I'm sorry hon. are you in any groups for vets? I feel like that would be a good place to start?
154,"It's okay. When I was a little younger than you, my then boyfriend only really enjoyed sex with new underwear. They had to be underwear he hadn't seen before, otherwise (do he claimed) sex wasn't exciting. I loved him, so i bought lots and lots of new underwear until the relationship fizzled out (thank God). Some things can only be learned through experience, and I am telling you now, you deserve a guy who is thrilled to have sex with you as you are. "
155,"Lots of people have special dietary needs and her restaurant recommendations seem really reasonable. I don't see the issue. If you're hosting people, it's generally in good manners to cater to dietary restrictions. It's not like she's demanding they spend hours cooking her some special feast. "
156,A company cares about profits. As soon as Brett cuts into those they will ban him immediately. The way to do this is to wait for him to harass a customer and then tell that customer he was banned earlier for sexual harassment. Then offer to write a complaint for them along the lines of - I was sexually harassed in this gym by somone with a history of sexual harassment and despite this Gym knowing that history you have not permanently banned him. I am thinking of suing this establishment for knowingly allowing sexual harassement to take place and not taking sufficient countermeasures.

My Grandma said she was never prouder of how my parents raised me when she saw that I was bringing home black and Indian friends to our home. Her and my Grandfather considered voting for Barack Obama one of the greatest moments in their lives - it really made them proud to be Americans to witness how far we'd come as a country.

That all said, I know they're an exception. My other grandma made comments to my Mom that I shouldn't be bringing home so many ""schvartzes"" (""blacks"" in Yiddish)."
158,"I can understand where Joe is coming from and he has not directly dismissed my concerns. He just has a different POV...it's tough being told that your close friend of 20 years is actually this terrible person, you know? I will look into what you suggested and show it to Joe, though, because I think he has been in denial for too long about the type of person George truly is."
159,"I have seen this before haha she has a crush on you. All of these panic attacks and what-not are lame excuses to guilt you into not having partners ""at the house."" She really doesn't want you to have any other relationships with men but she can only control what happens in the house. Good luck, she sounds really manipulative and narcissistic. 

Edit: P.S. I had this exact same thing happen to me before but with a guy that turned out gay. Reading your replies is making my back crawl right now. "
160,"I got that sense too, especially when he speaks about the anger as something separate from her usual self. That sounds like she dissociates which is a major BPD symptom. 

OP, I think you've got very caught up in wondering ""who the problem is"" and I think it might help, for now, to just consider the possibility that the *relationship* is the problem. This is a very unhealthy dynamic. I know you want to help, but it's actually not helping your girlfriend to be put in a situation where she flies into rages all the time. You've got into a bad pattern where you're both bringing out the worst side of each other. It really sounds like you both need to step back, and your girlfriend needs therapy. It's totally possible to emotionally support a BPD person while you're in a relationship with them and they get therapy, but I think you two have established such a terrible dynamic by this point that you can't get there from here. "
161,Sometimes things are cliche just because they're so common!
162,"Another small tidbit of advice: if it feels like things aren't working out with your counselor, get a new one, don't give up on therapy in general. 

This is slightly different but my SO was dealing with depression/anxiety and the first psychologist she went to was a useless, Freudian, it's due to your parents person. Now I have a degree in psychology and love Freud to death, but his theories and practices are outdated and not what was needed. My SO ended up feeling worse after every session. After a few months, I convinced my SO to go to a new one and the new psyc was significantly better and has actually helped. 

TL:DR: don't stick a with a therapist who isn't working for you, find a new one. "

I would call her the eff out, but that's just me. Next time she made a comment like that, I would say: That's really interesting that you would say that. Do you have a problem with my culture?

Or: You are making assumptions based on my culture and appearance and I don't appreciate it. 

Document, document and go to HR if it doesn't stop. What an idiot."

170,"&gt;not giving her a goodnight kiss not only sounds incredibly petty, but like you are willing to withhold other kinds of intimacy until you get laid as much as you want.

175,"Yeah, but, ultimately, you'd be fine without her. So she might as well pack up and go, given that she really hasn't made you *that* much happier than you were without her around. 

My point is that your being very flippant about your appreciation of your wife. She's done nothing to deserve that, other than register her hurt and disappointment at your comments. She probably feels like she loves you more than you love her, which puts her in a very vulnerable position-- especially because she's pregnant. I understand that you are grieving, but you do need to consider your actions from multiple perspectives before just opening your mouth."

183,"I'm amazed by how many people (given how few people have commented so far) are focusing on her rules! Like, oh yeah, your drug-addicted dad beat you, choked you, nearly shot your brother, and refused to resolve it with therapy, but the *real* problem here is that you're strict! What the hell?

188,Wow.... good thing your bf is dealing with this. This is a crazy situation that you did not create. Keep out of it as much as possible.
189,YES its ok to be traumatized by it. Don't let society convince you that just because you're a guy that you aren't allowed to be vulnerable. She was the person you were supposed to trust explicitly and she repeatedly lied to your face and deceived you. Most people who are honest and faithful have trouble wrapping their head around why anyone would do that and how they could live with themselves. Just don't punish other women for your ex's shitty behavior.

192,"Same. I was 23 when I started to date a 41 year old. We didn't know how old each other was when we first met, but hell, I look pretty young. But we dated for over a year and a half. I would actually say in the beginning, it was the healthiest relationship I ever had. He respected my boundaries, he and I both weren't clingy, we had our own interests and hobbies, and at the end of the day, we would always talk on the phone (little long distance) and always have something to talk about. I felt I really really found someone who loved me and treated me well. Even his parents and my parents both loved us! They didn't care about the age difference at all.

But then...after a little more than a year came the subtle put downs. I would always confront him in a gentle way about them and he would always make up some bullshit story about how I took it the wrong way or he would make it seem like how he put me down was justified and I actually believed it. Stupid me. 

I eventually broke up with him and we were friends that kept in touch, but didn't really see each other. But after a few months I became angry about the things he had said. Time and space away from him really brought out the truth; that he didn't treat me right. 

We both have a mutual hobby and hang out and he came there a few weeks ago and asked to talk to me. He felt he's been feeling sick to his stomach lately about how our relationship ended and that I was the ""healthiest"" relationship he's ever had and I wasn't abusive. I let him talk and then I told him how I felt about the way he treated me. That he was condescending and rude to me at times. And guess what he did? He didn't ""remember"" any of the instances I brought up. Pfft. 

Sorry, this turned into way longer than I wanted it to, haha. But yeah, it was REALLY fucking good for the first year and then it went downhill. But I've always been in emotionally abusive relationships and they say abusers can spot that from a mile away. But before that, I only dated guys around my age, so it can really happen in any age...control and manipulation. "

They weren't skeptic because if they were they would of kept it to themselves cause they would have seen it be a chance it was true. They were decided. 

Your family made a flash decision that someone going through a horrible time in their lives was a lisr and treated her horribly. She had given no reason for them to think otherwise but they did. 

But I guess they gave you their genes so it is perfectly fine for them to treat someone like shit. "
195,"Yes, this is the answer, OP. I and many others who live with depression can sometimes find it extremely difficult to manage things like personal care. Please frame this as a health issue, make an appointment and take her to a doctor.

""Honey, I've noticed lately that you've been (tired, lethargic, not as interested in XYZ as you used to be, unmotivated) and I'm worried about you. I'd like to make an appointment for both of us to get some blood tests to make sure we are in peak health. I'm also worried you're just sadder than you used to be. Does talking to someone about that sound like it might be helpful? I'll make the appointment for you if you like."""

197,"So you want your girlfriend to live a life you want, that she doesn't, to rack up student loan debt and take on a career she doesn't want, to assuage your fears regarding your ability to support a family?"
198,"Yeah, it sounds like he's more enamored of what he imagines the rapper lifestyle to be than of actually making music."
199,"&gt; she always would let people stay at her place when they're in town.

200,"Chores arent just chores. No one likes to do them but him doing the means you dont have to do something you dont want to and.... he doesnt care. He rather you make him comfortable than him being a reliable partner. Thats not a partner for life, he sees you as a maid he can bang."
201,"&gt; Who on earth is this ""everyone?""

Hate this. HATE this. My ex-husband liked to do that to me. He'd tell me that ""people"" were saying awful things about me and when I'd ask them who it was so I could seek them out and smooth the situation over, I'd get ""It's not important.""

So when I ended up leaving him all of those people who supposedly thought I flaunted my intelligence and was too outgoing and all that crap got pissed at HIM because guess what?

They liked me, and he couldn't stand it.

If I were OP I would ask for a list. 
"
202,"&gt; When was the last time he took her out of the house on a walk to do something? When was the last time he played dress up with her? When was the last time he had to spend a fucking afternoon with a bunch of Pinterest mommies so the kids could make friends while you sit and listen to some bitch yapping about her husband with erectile dysfunction?

Have you asked him any of those things?

And not in the ""adult"" way you continue to talk about here in your replies (which kind of seems to be synonymous for ""asshole""), but in a calm, respectable, mature manner?

You said this in the OP:

&gt; He got all indignant and said that he's shown he loved our daughter enough

So if he's not doing any of those things I quoted above, and you actually have a much stronger bond to your daughter than your husband does, how has he ""shown he loved our daughter enough"", **exactly**? In his mind?

For him, it kind of sounds like love=taking pictures. He takes a ton of pictures so he *obviously* loves his daughter. As someone who isn't on **any** form of social media whatsoever, I think that's preposterous. But I can't really discern from your OP or responses how he thinks he's exhibited his love more than you, other than just taking a shitload of pictures and shoving them down everyone else's throats by putting them on social media. "
203,I do mention my boyfriend when I'm having conversations with guys so they don't get any ideas. 
204,"I'm so sorry you experienced that.

I'm also from a large family, and I always knew my mom treated one of my sisters differently and accused her of being a devious and problematic kid when she behaved just like the rest of us. It's only been in the last couple of years that I've learned about the full extent of her abuse though. My other siblings do back-bends to avoid acknowledging how different her childhood was from ours--Even though they witnessed some crazy incidents! I get the sense my sister holds our siblings at arm's length sometimes for that reason.

I get where OP is coming from, because I've seen my siblings do more or less the same thing, and I understood *why* they did it. But if OP wants any kind of future relationship with her sister, she needs to a) stop invalidating her experiences, b) stay out of her sister's relationship with their parents and c) never, under any circumstance, carry information her sister tells her in confidence back to their parents.

OP, I really, really feel that you could benefit from r/raisedbynarcissists. It can help you understand your family dynamics with some clarity and break you out of the toxic thinking your parents taught you, which is in display in your comments both here and on the original thread."
205,"Yes, and I've been there, too. Lost my best friend that way. She was cheating on her husband. I called her out on it, and tried to get her to be honest. She refused. I told her husband and dropped her from my life."
206,Stop blaming alcohol for you being an asshole and accept your responsibility. Tell your fiancé so she can start over again with a nice guy. 
207,"Congratulations, you're a cheater. 

Even better, the kind that blames EVERYONE else before they blame themselves.

Do your wife a favour and be a man and leave her before you go try to relive your club days. This is the shit I was doing at eighteen. "
208,"First off, you never want to assume the negative response and try to hedge your bets. I'm not describing it perfectly, but you know what I mean, when you say ""Want to go out with me... no excuse not too, right?"" it's basically saying ""I know you don't really want to date me or anything but I'm better than doing nothing at all on Saturday evening?"" It's starting off by assuming she needs to be convinced to date you. Never offer ""reasons"" or start off by convincing.

Like if you want to ask her for her number or ask her to go out with you for a drink or whatever it is, just ask her and don't make an assumption about her interest. Don't assume she wants to, don't assume she doesn't want to, because you don't know. Just approach it with a ""we'll find out"" attitude. ""I enjoyed meeting you, wanna go to X together?"" or ""I'm going to this event, wanna come with"". It's less stilted and awkward.

Also, quit making your identity about how you were an ex chubby nerdy anti social guy. Don't worry about it, she's not dating the past you. She doesn't see you as you see yourself, and it's not helping you to think of yourself as socially stilted or undesirable. You can't keep making an identity out of your inexperience and insecurity that stems from your past - women will pick up on it like an odor. 

With situations like these when you put your foot forward and ask her out twice, you have played your hand. You didn't play it the best way you could have, sure, but you made your intentions clear. So you did your job, you can pat yourself on the back, at least you nutted up and asked. This means that now it's on her to decide, the ball is in her court. 

If she's interested, she'll text you or propose a time or give you some ""rope"" to work with. Even that little ""I can't Saturday but maybe next week"" is something to work with, but she doesn't seem to be giving you anything. Your best move is to focus on other options for now. "
209,"I'm engaged, and planning our wedding - WITH my fiancé!. That said, I broke down sobbing a week into our engagement because EVERYONE I was speaking to about wedding planning (family members, mostly, for advice) was acting as if my fiancé shouldn't get a say, and that I had to do it all on my own. "
210,"My fiancé had a friend who was descending into a drug problem.  They were old coworkers and would hang out and listen to death metal.   Well, he left a couple times while my fiancé was over. To go snort coke.   Came back sniffling and fidgeting with his nose.



I was really uncomfortable when he said he was going to hang out with him that night, as i knew him to be on a downward spiral.   They were not close enough for him to butt his nose into his friend's business.   I even spoke to my fiancé's father about what I should do in voicing my concern, as I did not want my fiancé hanging around someone of that caliber and being present for his drug use.



Well when he came home, he had the same feelings as me.  Was beyond uncomfortable being there and did not want any part in his life anymore.   I was relieved and said that I had similar feelings but didn't want to be pushy.   We were on the same page.


My point is, likely your husband is also on the same page as you.  Lucas needs an intervention and rehab for any hope, but he isn't your responsibility and you should not get mixed up in his troubles.  What if you were visiting when the cops busted him?   You'd be charged as an accessory.   Nope nope nope."
211,"I could get behind not asking them to pay if the work were well-done but not to OP's taste. But the removal of a load-bearing wall and the incorrect placement of flooring will be quite costly to fix. (The latter isn't as dangerous as the former, but it sounds like the ILs didn't even pay for the flooring, they used materials OP already had on hand.)"
212,"&gt;Yes, you need to at least tell them that while you appreciate the thought,

Nope - the in-laws need to be told quite clearly that they WAY overstepped and have severely fucked up.  Don't sugarcoat it, they were wrong to go in and renovate someones house.

213,"Cat dander is really awful. It can stay for YEARS. Even if you clean. I have severe cat allergies and I would not be able to live in a place where a cat had lived probably in the last couple of years (depending on how thoroughly it was cleaned, if it has carpets, how long the cat lived there...) You should do some research, but removing the dander is usually a very intensive process. People who live with a cat they're allergic through have to go through a lot of effort. However if you're taking everything with you and just leaving walls and hardwood floors it should be easier, you'd probably just have to wipe everything down. Do some research though. Or you could just tell your landlord about the cat, or hope that the next tenant doesn't have allergies. "
214,"Since the wedding is over, you're in the clear to ask the bride and see if she's still someone worth you time. If it's true, that's an incredibly shitty superficial reason to unask someone to be in your wedding.

217,"There is a big difference in maturity with that age difference. 20 to 24 not a big deal. 40 to 44 you'll barely notice.

16 to 20? Yeah big red flags.

A lot of younger girls/women don't seem to appreciate that if a significantly older man is interested in you, it probably means they have maturity/relationship issues that stop more age appropriate women being interested in them. **For a good reason**.

Also don't use Tinder when you're 16. That just won't end up well."
218,"How exactly would he be crucified? 

I Myself had an unstable parenting situation and it honestly took me a few relationships and plenty of time to get to the point where I could be honest and stable in a relationship (And even still I struggle sometimes.) 

It's not an ""Aww your poor wife"" thing as much as an ""This makes sense why she would act this way given her history"" thing. They've been in therapy for 2 years and improved greatly and she trusts him enough to tell him about this part of her mental process. "
219,"I'm not trying to be rude, but don't you think that your anecdotal evidence is kind of...well...useless? This doesn't apply to all white people, but generally (and I think this applies to you) because of your skin colour, you're lucky enough to miss out on experiencing this kind of shit, and because you haven't seen it, it therefore “doesn't happen” or “employees don't get stereotyped” or “lets not jump to conclusions”.

222,"&gt; I'm telling you, as someone who suffers from an anxiety disorder, not going anymore is going to feel like a form of punishment for being anxious.

If OP doesn't want to be ""punished"" for being anxious, maybe she should work harder on not being anxious - and I say that as someone who also has an anxiety disorder. 

Sometimes, having anxiety means you miss out on fun shit. That's why it's called a disorder and not a gift. If you don't like it, you either learn to self-regulate better so you can do the fun shit or accept the consequences of your limitations. "
223,"Why don't you just flat out ask him about it?  His answer may surprise you.  

If he gets upset by you flirting/hooking up with others then you may want to think about not hooking up on a weekly basis because he may have already started developing feelings for you.  

It just really sounds like you tow need to have a serious conversation about the relationship you two have.  
"
224,"Hi OP! I also had a breast deformity up until last summer (tg for surgery), and I totally understand where you're coming from. 

For background: my breasts were two completely different sizes (DD and A cups). And everything you wrote up there is something I've felt or done in my life. For example, the ""seeing only one breast"" thing– I did the *exact* same. My DD breast was the one that got to come out and play while I did my damndest to hide the fact I wore a prosthetic on the other side. You can check my post history for more details about my boob life and surgery if you want.

And on the topic of surgery and affording it– see if you can get it covered by insurance. My insurance covered mine because it was causing me mental harm. I would really suggest at least talking to a surgeon and seeing what your options are. 

But regardless, surgery isn't going to happen tomorrow. So I'm going to give you a rundown of how I survived living with ""deformed breasts"" (we shouldn't call them that, they're just different!). 

1. Have someone you can talk to about this. My mom was my rock throughout puberty and my freshman year of college. Every time I felt insecure, or couldn't go swimming with other people, or couldn't change in my own room because my roommate was there, I would text my mom. And she supported me through it all just by listening. Having someone you trust listen to you rant about it is a serious lifesaver.

2. Going off that: get therapy. My breasts played a huge part in the way I saw myself and honestly contributed really negatively to my self-esteem. It also affected all of my relationships negatively, and therapy helped me work through my trust issues that stemmed from my boobs. 

3. Find something about your body that you *really* love that you can look at when you feel bad about your breasts. Maybe I'm shallow, but I really felt broken by having my breasts be ""wrong."" It felt like I was less of a woman. So to counteract that, I got really into makeup (not saying makeup is only for women but you get where I'm going). I'm no good at makeup, but seeing me with a freshly done face makes me feel really *good* and it helped me get through days where I felt like an accident of a human being. 

4. This tip is going to be a little bit hypocritical, because it's something I never did (but really wish I did). Do not be afraid to have a relationship with someone just because of this. **And do not feel like someone is settling for you.** Your boobs are not a detraction of you as a person. 

An expansion on point 4: I never showed my boobs to anyone pre-surgery. But post-surgery I most definitely have, and my nipples now look pretty different from each other thanks to it. And my most recent SO noticed, and asked about it. For a second I flashed back to every fear and insecure moment and self-hating feelings I ever had... But then realized that they didn't care. As soon as I explained the story, they just held me really tight and said how sorry they were that I went through that, and then continued to play with my boobs because they liked my boobs, different nipples or not. 

If the guy you're with doesn't do that, that is a reflection on *him* and not on *you.* Don't let anyone make you feel inferior for being different.

I hope you can find confidence in your body now. And if you can't, I hope you find a way to have surgery to make yourself confident (no shame in that, it's what I had to do). Best of luck to you, OP!"
225,Plus since they've apparently only been married a few weeks then depending on the jurisdiction the wife might be able to get an annulment. That could save her a lot of time and money compared to a divorce.
226,"I feel like you're blowing this WAY out of proportion. As if she had a sinister intention of this from start to finish until this post. 

None of us actually know this woman or OP. None of us know their relationship as well as they do. From the information that is given to us, it seems to me to be more of a thing that didn't start until later in their relationship (when the problems started) and it was something she didn't know how to process or feel, just knew she was feeling different and based on her previous examples of relationships (her parents) this was normal. 

"
227,"That's pretty funny, are you actually jealous of his sister? I mean, I get the complaint that he never posts pictures of you, that's fair and he should do that too, but the funny confusion is good, to me."
228,"As much as I hate to say it, you're both the ""odd man out"" now that your parents have found love with a different partner.  You're both the kids from the ""old"" marriage.  Now they have new families that are shiny and new.  As someone else said, you're both the ""part time"" kids but the other kids are full time.

Now that I've said that, if what you say is not an exaggeration, your parents are pieces of shit for treating the two of you this way.

At 14 and 15 it would be nearly impossible for you to have a conversation with your parents without them running circles around you.  They'll likely deflect, deny, and redirect everything back at you.  If your grandfather knows what's going on then maybe he can speak to them on your behalf?

Either way, this is a pretty horrible spot to be in.  If you can and if you're confident enough, sit them down, one at a time, and the three of you have it out and get some answers out of them.  Explain to them exactly how you feel about what's going on here.  

It's hard to say where to go with it after that unless I know what they say."
229,"It's normal to be attracted to other people even when you're in a relationship. What's NOT okay is when they act on that attraction (read: cheating) or they flaunt their attraction in front of you. I had a ""boyfriend"" who would comment about every hot girl we'd pass by. It's like, what's your point? Fucker ended up cheating on me."

231,"Definitely a very slim possibility, but it could be a possibility nonetheless. Wasn't there a story on this sub that was somewhat similar about brothers who swapped wives or something like that? I vaguely remember seeing something similar. But yea this situation is most likely not that."
232,"That's because your parents befriended like minded people, as most adults do. You found yourself in a neighborhood and community of similar people, but that does not mean it's the only type of successful couple out there. That's quite naive to assume. 

Don't try to be who you think your husband wants (didn't work anyway right, he still cheated). Be the person that makes your happy. You know who makes a happy, healthy couple? Happy, healthy people."

235,"&gt;  Are you going to stay with this guy until one day he's rough, you ask him to stop, and he doesn't

He already does that. I've pretty much cried and begged him to stop but he just doesn't listen.

That's why it's beaten me down so much... :/
"
236,"Yeah, no one believes that. Nor do we believe you are 24. "
237,"Alright here's the deal: even if you had ADHD, you still gotta do your best to not be a garbage pail baby. You don't get the diagnosis and some drugs and suddenly like a caterpillar bursting from the cocoon you are now a graceful butterfly with no faults. You know how they say abs are built in the kitchen and they're 80% diet and 20% workout? Similar concept. ADHD is 80% setting up routines and plans mandatory behaviors for yourself and 20% medication. 

And do you honestly not understand how offensive it is that you have no diagnosis and this awesome scapegoat that just recently dropped into your lap excuses your behavior? You sound like you're young and immature and just don't really care that much about what's going on around you. And that's fine. But to suddenly go ""EUREKA! I don't have to do shit to become a better person because the googles says I have the add!"" Not cool, man. "
238,"It honestly doesn't sound like he's out. This relationship has been going on long enough that yes, you should have met at least SOME of the other people in his life. Especially with him telling you that any PDA is unacceptable and proof of you being ""needy,"" I'm thinking that either he hasn't told everyone in his life that he's gay (or bi, etc) or that he has some unresolved homophobia issues, perhaps. Of course, there are straight people who are also uncomfortable with PDA; but combined with him being reluctant to introduce you on anyone, it seems like a shame issue. And you don't deserve for the person you're with to be ashamed to be openly with you. It may be that this was an important relationship for you to have, and a formative learning experience, but that it's run its course. You sound like you want a warm, affectionate and public, integrated life with your SO, and that this is not a guy who can give you that. "
239,"The thing is, I really don't think my SIL is manipulatable at this point. She and I are close. If I come to her saying my brother was cheating, she'll believe me over him hands down. He has a history of fucking up ... and there's really no reason that I would BS her. She knows that. "
240,"He isn't just being annoying. He's dangerous, and you are being abused. Do not listen to him. You need to get away from him ASAP. He doesn't want you going to your mom because he wants to be able to keep abusing you. "
241,"More than likely, I would bet she will be able to tell. She might not get it right away. It might take time. Months, years. But there will be signs. Not always perhaps, and they may be subtle, but they'll still be there. You're going to drop the act one time, or say something about her when you don't think she can hear. When she comes home from school and wants to talk about her day, she's going to see that you have no interest. She's going to come across that Instagram account with your pets one day. She's going to see the lack of photos around the house, or the lack of crafts and school projects that you've saved. She's going to notice that you spend more time with your pets or with others than you do with her. She's going to know it in your body language, your touch, and the look in your eyes. It will all come together one day to explain to her what your feelings are. Eventually she will realize it, whether you directly express it or her or not."
242,"Meal prepping might be a bust, they actually get lunch and dinner provided so she says she always has something to eat (hence my confusion and thought that maybe she's just not eating enough rather than not eating at all). We have some snacks in the cupboard which she'll grab sometimes like granola bars, actual granola, corn chips/salsa, stuff like that, but I'll bring it up to her again that maybe she needs to start taking some good smaller snacks with her to eat on the go :)"
243,"So, you already know the answer to this godparent question. I think you also need a little bit of a reality check about the wife, though.

&gt;I don't know what I did, but I stopped because I don't want to force myself on her.

Here's the thing -- this isn't just YOU who could make her hate you, right?

*How her husband acts at the mention of you is probably where all her dislike comes from*.

You *do not know* how he talks about you when you are not there. For all you know, she caught him jacking off and moaning your name one night. *You don't know*. You WANT to think he's your best friend because YOU see him this way -- but as a HUMAN, you just NEVER know what another person GENUINELY thinks of you. So never, ever, ever assume.

It could be as simple as you look like a cousin who made fun of her. 

Or, much more likely, the guy she constantly has to hear about you from did something really stupid at some point so she's taking out her anger on you.

But the end result is the same -- you don't genuinely know how your best friend is in a romantic relationship since you never have been in one with him. So don't try and make it all about yourself or what you may have done -- other people can often ruin your impressions for you. And that's life."
244,"I mean, it is and it isn't empty. It's an honor, but one that comes with no obligation and is probably going to enrage his wife if she hates you this much. The net benefit to him is just anger from his wife. 

It's great you think this much of him, but with an SO like that, it seems like he's just going to suffer for it. 

Could you maybe do something else? Baptism if that's your thing, make sure he's involved maybe? Make it clear to him you're inviting family and that includes him?"
245,"I'm going through our old conversations with Sarah and honestly I feel used right now. She knew I was passionate about the things that this guy appeared to be into and she used that to get his attention. She normally mocks me for being into these things and says who reads up on politics, religion and philosophy at your age. Yet she used me to get a date with him. She knew they didn't have anything in common but pushed it because she found him attractive. Ive warned her about this before because it really isn't the first time shes gone after a guy purely for his looks. 


as to me following anything with him, I don't think so. I never looked at him that way so no I'm not really smitten. I just enjoy finding/talking to people who have similar passions. "

If she's using you as a coaster then you can always go home."
248,"&gt; what I am going to say is not going to paint her in the best light

I actually don't have a problem with your sister's actions. She is the boss of what she does with her body, she was straightforward about her standards and conditions from the beginning of this relationship, and she communicated that to her boyfriend. 

You, on the other hand, need to do some self-examinations. You seem to feel like a wilder youth disqualifies her from making different choices and having different standards as an adult. It does not. Society has messed up standards for women and weird ideas surrounding virginity, such that once you're no longer a virgin a lot of folks have you in the ""ruined"" category, so feel like you ""don't have an excuse"" to not have sex. I'm getting that feeling from you. It's not correct. She could have banged the football team and the entire marching band in high school; she still has the right to decide now that she doesn't feel comfortable having sex without commitment. 

Secondly, you fucked up by declaring that this guy could still come to you as a friend and discuss intimate details about his sexual relationship with your sister. You are not a neutral bystander, and your loyalty belongs with the sister you claim is your best friend. It's absolutely not appropriate for you to be sympathetically listening to your buddy complain about blue balls. That's your sister's sex life, and you should stay out of it. 

Thirdly, this idea that it's your place to add pressure to your sister to drop the clear standards she's set out in her relationship and threaten/bully her into having sex with your friend so she doesn't lose him--why are you so fucking invested in this relationship? It's none of your business. Your friend doesn't come off great here either, grumbling to you. He knew what the deal was going into this, correct? Sounds like he's ticked that he hasn't gotten her to change the rules she set out, but if he can't handle it, it's on him to leave, not on her to compromise her desires and principles *if she doesn't want to.*

Butt out. You're overstepping. "
249,"&gt; he is my soulmate, we are on a different level of understanding with each other and it is true love

&gt; some things got ugly, both of us talked mad shit about each other to our families...he talked a lot of shit about me to our mutual friends

Well, gee, good to know what ""true love"" is like."
250,"I mean, it sounds like he already knows to some extent from the situations you've described. Research supervisors are around students steeped in anxiety/depression/worse health issues all the time because the environment is stressful. If he's in his forties, odds are good that he's had at least one other student with health issues at least as severe as yours, to say nothing of his own experiences as a student and with colleagues. He sounds like he cares about you. Check-ins are a good sign. 

Only you can really say if you're comfortable with disclosing and if this would affect your relationship. Ask yourself what you expect from him after disclosure. Would he cut you more slack, and do you feel that he isn't accommodating enough in the first place? Would it give you peace of mind just to know that he doesn't think you're mentally ill without seeking help? Would he judge your work by a different metric? 

Personally I would drop in to the office with a cup of coffee, summarize the situation in a few sentences, conclude by saying I appreciate his support and guidance, then leave to do some work so it doesn't drag out awkwardly and he has time to consider the information afterwards alone, but can find me in the office or lab if he needs further discussion. 

Also, I'm sure you already know this, but don't put pressure on yourself to churn out data or get work done. Everyone feels like they're not doing enough. Get better first so the research doesn't drag you down further. "
251,"Sometimes people do realize when they're confronted. Having someone you love and respect lay into you actually can make people realize they're on the wrong path. I wont say it's common, but I can understand feeling like you have to try everything. 

But everything has been tried. Continuing to fight will not help the child, op cannot stop this from happening. It's time to decide if she can be the role model her niece desperately needs, or if it's time to step out of her sister's life."
252,"Actually, no. She was going through a hard time and I had been thinking all day about how to help her."
253,"&gt; your brother a larger and stronger male... smaller female sister

The sister was a year older, so it's actually extremely possible that she was larger and stronger at 15."
254,"You can't help her.  She is refusing to deal with her illness and you can't change that.  Right now, you are enabling her bad behavior and enabling her refusal to get help because you aren't letting her feel the consequences of her actions.

You cannot fix this issue.  It is not your issue and it is not a relationship issue.  Please listen to what I'm saying, since I've been in her shoes...YOU CANNOT FIX THIS.  SHE HAS TO FIX THIS ON HER OWN.  She is not healthy enough to date anyone right now."

It seems like the main reason you have for having a relationship with him is so you can have one with your grandson, so I guess the vibe I'm getting is you guys didn't get along in the past? "
258,"There's been several comments like this that I responded to. Tl;dr version is that I will give input and feedback but I want her to be happy so how much involvement I have in planning I leave up to her, because I could be happy with any kind of wedding. "

Have you shown her where it says on the side of the package that the TP is septic safe?  I'm willing to bet that tank needs pumped. The septic guy will tell her what's ok and not ok. 

Honestly she's going about this backwards. She should be pooping in the trash and throwing the TP in the toilet if she's that worried about the septic tank. Poop takes longer to break down in there than TP. IIRC. 

"
261,"With S01E02, my boyfriend and his friend watched it and thought it was good and entertaining. I watched it and was so disgusted that I ended up bawling. It's almost painful to watch. "
262,"&gt; Boyfriend also didn't seem to care that anyone was trying to sabotage their relationship which certainly raises suspicion...

He's probably just so confident that his plan is fool proof so he's never caught and confident that OP would never dream of questioning the trust they have in their relationship...It definitely doesn't look good either that he's constantly talking about all his work colleagues cheating on their spouses. I mean, obviously it doesn't mean he's doing it as well, but I reckon it's more likely that if he's surrounded by that daily, that he not only would learn the ""tricks of the trade"" when it comes to secrecy but also he might start to see this as the ""norm"" behaviour (especially if coworkers are telling him that it's totally fine or whatever)."
263,"OP, my heart breaks for you.  This must feel like an ultimate betrayal.  Please please please do not go to their place. Please do not subject yourself to being around that monster.  It is really sucky that you already bought your ticket, but I consider it actually really good that you found out BEFORE going, and not upon arrival!

Go literally anywhere else that you can with your ticket."
264,I think it's disrespectful to the guy that bought the drink...
265,"First of all, I question whether sam *really* knew what the situation was with Brian. You say he did, so if he did, okay... but you say it kind of wishy-washy, like you just assume he *should* know. Was everything laid out in paper? It really, really should have been. If it wasn't, it's hard to tell if Sam actually completely 100% knew the situation or not. And if it was, this should be a non-issue because you can just point to the written agreement about it.

But all that's in the past at this point. Your question is can Sam or the landlord kick out Brian.

The answer is, it depends on your state, but almost definitely not. Most states would regard him as a tenant by now and require 30 days notice to evict him, and then they'd have to actually evict him, all of which would take longer than the 6 weeks you have there.

Yes, your roommate probably can complain to the landlord about the kitten. How the landlord handles this is up to them. I suspect most landlords wouldn't care, especially if your lease is almost up. It's possibly they'll charge you a pet fee, or additional cleaning services once you move out. There is a *chance* they can evict you or break your lease for having a pet, but again that's pretty much an empty threat because it will almost certainly take longer to go through that process than you have left on your lease. But again, it depends on your local laws.

So finally, my advice? You have six weeks. For the next six weeks, Brian's apartment is your bedroom and that's it. He comes home, he goes into your bedroom. He doesn't cook. He doesn't sit on the living room couch. He doesn't sit at the kitchen table, even to eat-- he eats in the bedroom or before he gets home. He comes out to use the bathroom and leave for work and that's it.

Sam and Brian have absolutely zero contact for the next six weeks. Explain that to Sam, refuse to pay any additional amount in rent, and tell him if he has a problem with it he's welcome to contact the landlord.

And stick to that. Stick to not compromising any further for Sam, and stick to Brian staying only in the bedroom. I know that sucks, but you just need to get through *six more weeks* and be done with it.

Furthermore, your kitten follows the same rules. Both to appease Sam (even though he probably doesn't actually care, it could help, and give you ammunition if Sam complains) and for the kitten's safety. I don't want to be alarmist, but Sam could get really nasty with that kitten. You don't want to test them.

Anyway, that's my advice.

By the way, get a lock for your door, and keep it locked at all times. A small security cam may not be out of line, either."
266,Agreed. Accepting a drink from a man you've never met while In a relationship is STUPID and impractical 
267,"This is absolutely horrible advice. In this scenario you'd be treating a child with real emotions and thought as just some pawn to be manipulated. The worry, confusion and hurt is absolutely unnecessary when you can just try to speak frankly to your husband. It doesn't sound like you've shared as much about what you're feeling and thinking about the situation to him as you have been with us strangers on here. Get him out of the house so your MIL can't eavesedrop and open up to him. I don't think he understands  how miserable this is making you."
268,"You need to schedule a check up with your doctor for you and your sister.

After being weighed, ask if your weight is within the range of healthy weights for a girl your age/height. If the doctor says yes, turn to your mom (make sure she is there) and say, ""You can stop fat shaming me now. A medical professional has just confirmed that my weight is completely healthy.""

(You might want to research ahead of time to confirm that your weight does in fact fall within the accepted range. You might also want to warn your doctor ahead of time as well.)"
269,"Yeah, if there were no female relatives (or very close family friends) of the right age I think most people would just go without a flower girl rather than ""it's the grooms ex-fiancée's daughter with whom he hasn't maintained a relationship"" because that's effing weird and inappropriate."
270,"No, it would not.  Both parents, unless there's a custody order in place with the courts, have the right to move their children anywhere they please within the country.

There's no difference whether it's the mother or the father, a parent with custodial rights (which is what you have by default when you are a married couple, living together or no) can't ""kidnap"" their own child."
271,"Great advice. I'd also add that ""stories about your sexcapades or your brushes with the law"" are, for a lot of friend-groups, everyone's favorite at 22 and ""oh nooo, Dave's telling that one about the time he did mushrooms again"" at 27. Your friends are going to forget you're the one who did ___ and didn't do ___ but they'll remember you were nice, funny, fun to hang out with..."
272,Lots of women who enable their partners abuse are otherwise very good and loving mothers. Mary may be afraid of her partner but it's still important that you and your mother put them first. 
273,"No one knows what goes on in a relationship, and even though it effects you so much, it's not your job to fix their relationship or read their minds or gather evidence. Maybe they haven't had sex in years, or your dad is making this all up, or they had an agreement to have an open marriage or whatever-- it's not like you want to know or think about any of those possibilities. It's between them and let it stay there.

So I suggest saying to both that you won't pick sides and won't hear either bad-talk either. You can be sad and tell them you are sad without casting blame. 

A similar thing happened to me when I found out my dad was gay. It was tough being Switzerland and I wasn't able to all the time-- there were definitely times she blamed me for knowing and not telling her and taking his side, times he told me a lot of information about their sex lives I really didn't need to hear. I wish I had held to the role of being their child more-- to say, ""He's my dad, I don't want to hear him spoken badly about"" or ""You're my dad, I don't want to hear these things."" 

Marriages are important things, but so is having parents who can fill their role of parenting you. They have no right to make you chose between them or to poison your relationship with the other. They have no right demanding that you be other than their kid (like the way mine turned to me like a therapist or a friend). Stick to your guns-- you need them both, even if they can't be together.  "
274,Actually multiple studies have found that it is just an unfounded stereotype. It is no more common for single children then those with siblings. 
275,"&gt; Since I know that affairs almost every time happen for a reason,

The reason is due to the person that cheated. As you learned, people in good marriages sometimes cheat, while people in bad marriages don't necessarily cheat.

"
276,"Now that you're broken up, you'll never know the heartache that comes with being with someone like that for years and years until you feel like you don't have any other options (and that's definitely a good thing!) You're so young and you have so many years ahead of you to find someone better, who is 100% invested. It's awesome that you're not squandering your 20s on a useless, passive-aggressive, insensitive jerk. Indulge in a whole lot of ice-cream and then move onwards and upwards!"
277,Become the dude you wanted to marry
278,"Uh no, it's beyond ""not contributing"".  Why did he lose his license?  Why did you move to an entirely different city to chauffeur him around?  Why did you let him manipulate you into a boat?  Why do you keep doing the chores he ignores?  "
279,Yeah. When you put it that way it doesn't sound very smart at all. 
280,"It seems that all reasonable arguments and excuses don't work.

Which means you need to accept that group lunches are one of the ""unwritten job requirements"" at this job, to be part of the team and move ahead. 

Yes, you can double down and insist on lunching alone, which most of the commenters here are suggesting. You can take this up to HR and enforce it. It will probably work, and you can lunch alone without your boss insisting.

But this will come at the price of straining your relationship with the boss and colleagues, and limiting your mobility in the company. In a sales job, how your colleagues perceive you directly affects your advancement. (Unfair as it is, this matters double if you're a woman.) You will find yourself cut out of the loop, and in hard times, you're going to be first up on the chopping block.

You might win the battle (lunching alone), but you will lose the war (building a career). You seem to be young and starting out, you don't want to burn yourself this early.

A smarter option would be to go to lunch with this group as often as you can bear now, to maintain good relations at this company, and start looking for a job with a better cultural fit. Discreetly feel out people for other positions, and float your resume.

P.S. As a sales person, you must be socially aware enough to realize that leaving super early leaves a bad impression, even if you're coming in early and getting work done. Combined with the lunch, you're giving a unintentional message of ""I don't like my colleagues,"" and party planning committees aren't enough.

P.P.S. You mention that ""it's exhausting being as positive and friendly as I am,"" which is yet another reason why you might want to explore other jobs. Are you exhausted by interacting with people? Are you an introvert? If so, I really would suggest transitioning away from front-line sales, because it's going to burn you out long term."
281,"&gt;FWIW he's had a huge infatuation with me since we met, 

That's the red flag. He's been building this relationship up in his head and now you're real and not following his fantasy - such as telling him which house to buy that you'll marry him and live in.

The showing you off to his friends is just tacky. "
282,"As long as you and the guy you cheated with keep working together, it's never going to work with your partner."
283,"Therapy is great advice because her guilt issues go really deep. I'd definitely also say that you should keep working up to it in bits.. Take naked showers, fondling, comments cuddling etc. 
Go into these moments knowing it won't lead to sex, and she won't feel pressure and you won't feel as frustrsted. "
284,"&gt; but there is no sense in which that's true of religion (or even Christianity) as such.

Except every sense. 

&gt;There's plenty of stuff that's extremely sex-positive coming out of mainline Christian denominations.

Cannot call bullshit on this enough. Like WHAT?"
285,It definitely isn't helping that by praying they are basically inviting a father figure to watch and approve them doing the dirty
286,"I read somewhere that on a good day, be faithful in order to respect your partner. On a middling day, be faithful in order to respect your marriage. And on a bad day, be faithful in order to respect yourself. The idea being that compromising your own morals/ethics/self-regard is the most basic reason to behave honestly. "
287,She doesn't have any. He's holding her hostage over the last fifty bucks she has.
288,"Seriously. Him calling her lazy? She's working as an architect and planning a wedding. A wedding is a huge thing to plan and there are so many details involved. He says she's not a girly girl so he doesn't know where it's coming from. Wanting a nice wedding, taking time to plan those details, seriously OP, you don't need to be a girly girl to do that... "
289,"Hey there, I'm a man. I've never cheated, I don't sleep around, I'm very responsible and communicate very well with people about my wants and needs. Did I mention, I have never cheated? Good, because I know how to keep my dick in my pants, and I have enough respect and decency to not betray the people who put their trust in me. 

Not all men are cheaters, you just got involved with a pathetic worm who put on a good show. It's not your fault, it happens sometimes. But it isn't a reflection of who you are or that all people of the opposite gender are cheaters. 

It hurts right now because it's fresh, and what your ex did was horrible, and he's a terrible excuse for a human. Not all men are like that, and he can just go kick rocks. "
290,"Doesn't ""most women"" also go through that phase?

And it is not true that men need to ""get it out of their system"". Thats the kind of excuse some men use. There are a lot of men who never had that phase. Many men do go through life only having sex with 1 woman, or with the 2-3 long term girlfriends they happened to have. It is bullshit that men needs to go through a phase like that. "
291,"Yes she thinks it's a ""minor offense"""
292,"I put his towel in the dryer this morning while he showered so he'd have a cozy towel to dry off with. Got that trick from reddit. 

He still insists on opening every door for me, when we drive he takes right turns harder than left to lean me into him. Some nights we stay up  late cuddled in bed just talking. 

Together four years, married two months! "
293,"So here are some things to consider.

Is this a common reaction your wife has to things that upset her, or is this really out of character for her? If this is out of character, this reaction may indicate something deeper is going on for her than merely she thinks it's unfair. 

If this is the case, than I think it would benefit you both to sit down during a calm time and try to get down to the bottom of what's going on with her. Ask questions without judgement, validate the way she feels, you don't have to agree, but the feelings are real to her. Even though I believe she is being unreasonable, hear her out as to why she feels it's okay for you not to buy a birthday gift for a someone you consider a close friend. This will at least allow her to be heard which can go a long way to decreasing defensiveness and lead to an actually productive conversation. This will allow you both to discuss your side of things, and hopefully come to an agreement on the best way to proceed.

If this is a common reaction from her, and she often says things like this to you, she is being emotionally abusive toward you. You should either consider getting couple's counselling if you want to continue the relationship, or consider divorce. "
294,"It may be hard to believe because of your experience so far in life, but college is the beginning of a bigger world opening up for you, and out here most people really don't care about your height. Of course you'll run across the occasional butthole who will hassle you about it, but for the most part, real adults aren't going to worry themselves over something so trivial."
295,"Be careful not to justify your case as what other people are getting paid. 

Only justify what you do, what you are worth, what you bring to the table."
296,"NO.

NO.

NO.

One, you're not sober and you need to focus on that as your top priority.

Two, the age difference is far too significant.  You should be in VASTLY different stages of life.  He has far too much life experience over you, almost TWICE as much.  Its so not ok.  Im sorry but you are prime fodder to be manipulated... you feel hopeless already about guys your age (or whoever youve encountered on tinder thus far) and special that this guy is doing the *hugely generous* act of actually talking to you for more than a day or two.  Add to that, the vulnerabity of non-sobriety.  I look at that and I just see 'easy prey' written all over it.

Fuck your 'mentor' for her incorrect and predator-apologist feedback.

This is not ok.

Focus on your sobriety and leave tinder behind, at least for a while.

The reality is the way a lot of peoole get treated on tinder really makes the app seem well named.

  You're not in the right phase right now for that bullshit.

Your last sentence about nit wanting to miss out on possibly being treated well by a guy reeks of insecurity, desperation and vulnerability.  I swear I just felt a prey-drive be activated.

You will get chewed up until you get yourself straight   - sobriety and therapy should be your priorities."
297,"Hey, if you're the OP, I think you just replied from your regular account."
298,"Well, to be fair she does know how to torrent. And you can order benzo analogues without knowing how to access tor/darknets from research chemical labs."
299,I wonder if she got pregnant?
300,Holy cow. Then you need to sit down and have a talk with them. Make it clear that you are not available and force their hand in this. They need to form a plan yesterday. Especially in light of the fact that your brother is bigger than you. You are uniquely unqualified for this sort of work.

302,"1 year shy of him being triple her age, it's just crazy."
303,"I totally see that point, which is why I think both of your feelings are very valid and real. 

I also see why you guys side stepping the issue and then him planning to propose is a slap in the face to your very real and heartfelt proposal. 

You guys have to sit down and talk about it. Focus on why you feel the way you feel."
304,"Gymnasium means high school, not college. "
305,"Dump him. 

He is untrusting and insecure and smothing and has you feeling like it's on you to fix it. It is not. 

He is not in the headspace to have a healthy relationship."
306,"Start getting good at snarky comments.  

'Wow, you must love him for his money cause you are hot amiright?' 

'Wow dear sweet friend, you really should make an appointment with a doctor, there must be something seriously wrong with your memory cause only last year he was broke and I was fat and we loved each other anyway.' 

You two also need to sit down as a couple and agree to stop flashing cash in front of your jealous friends.  Don't tell them it was an expensive laptop. They don't need to know if he decides to buy a watch. You can downplay expensive cars 'It was a gift from his family (true enough) or 'Yeah the payments are insane'. 

Your friends probably don't have the money for pricy stuff and its pretty awkward to be eating ramen while your bestie is dropping mad money on vacations you will never be able to take yourself. They aren't handling jealously very well. "
307,Which is fine but he needs to be open and truthful with OP about that.  She's made it clear that she does want to eventually get married so if he doesn't want that then they need to break up so she can find a guy who wants the same things in life that she does.
308,"When nice people break up, they use a set of conventional ""reasons"" that are designed not to be hurtful. They are not necessarily the *real* reason.

Thus, where someone unpleasant would say the real reasons, for example: ""You snore, have a fat ass, bad taste in clothes, worse taste in music, appalling friends, and your facial spots make me nauseous, I'm banging your BFF, and I thought you were richer"", someone nice will say ""I'm not good enough for you"", ""It's not you, it's me"" 

Let this one go. It's not your fault, and it's not fixable. And you probably don't want to know the real reason."
309,It's been three years and you haven't taken any steps to change? You need to accept it's too late and this is how she feels.
310,I didn't even consider that. :/ It's hard for me to imagine anyone being that vicious... But as you say it does happen. 
311,"Yeah you're telling two different stories here OP...

Whether it's her lying to her parents or you've earned your reputation, there's still something majorly wrong. 

You guys seem to have lots of communicative issues...

And it doesn't sound like she's all that committed to making things ""work"" 

"
312,"I'm sorry but honestly you're so very in the wrong here. A man being a shitty partner does not negate his right to be a father to his children. And you can scream ""my child not his"" until you're blue in the face, but the DNA disagrees with you. You've been wronged but that doesn't justify you stopping your child having a meaningful relationship with his/her father.  "
313,"Hey OP (: I think you have plenty of replies about the logistics of your situation, but I wanted to encourage you to seek therapy. It might sound like a broken record in /r/relationships, but you are going through a LOT right now. Your life has turned upside down and you have a divorce, pregnancy and potentially parenthood looming ahead of you. You are understandably upset and it's okay and normal to be upset in your situation, but it's very important that you make sure you take care of yourself and your own mental wellbeing. I think it would really benefit you to have someone to help you navigate the emotional minefield of your life right now (: please look into it! Good luck with everything (:"
314,Are you the husband? This is crazy off the wall advice no sane person would ever give. 
315,"Wanting to be a submissive female partner isn't incompatible with an egalitarian social outlook. There are many women (myself included) that are into that kink only during sex. It doesn't extend into real life. Someone can be a feminist and like getting gagged in bed. They aren't mutually exclusive. 

If you describe yourself as basically asexual, I don't understand why you're talking about this with any sense of experience or authority. "
316,"Yes! Disgusting that he would say this is bc of the miscarriage. This has been going on much longer, and he is a double jerk for not taking responsibility. Thank goodness you don't have kids with him - get out! Go find a good man and a happy life!

Edit: sorry if the ""don't have kids"" part came off as insensitive. But I do think the universe hooked you up. He is a lousy husband. Sorry for your loss."
317,"That all sounds fairly non-conclusive, but you could definitely be on to something. There isn't much you can do except ask, unless you want to take the snooping route. 

Even if he's straight, you guys need to work through your sex issues. Do you want to be with someone who isn't sexually compatible with you, whatever the reason is?"
318,"I think it's easier for gifts longer you're together since if you listen to your spouse you can hear random things like ""man that would be nice to have"" ""or that looks great"" sort of banter.

I keep a running list year round. 

Same with my so. He was absolutely shite with gifts when we got together and as we age our relationship he's getting so much better at hearing the ""I wish/I want"" that he ended up getting me something i totally forgot I said I wanted and was truly surprised "
319,"I agree. I'm definitely not dismissing it--it's completely possible for these feelings to turn into something! But it seems like a lot of what OP is saying is based in seeing her boyfriend act a certain way rather than her own experiences, outside of a couple of cute (snuggly) interactions. That's lovable and easy to attach to. It's also valid, but this needs a lot of communication and consideration.

I'm childfree. I had a two month period of time where I *really* wanted a baby a few years ago. No idea where it came from and no idea where it went, just as quickly as it appeared. If it had stuck around for a long period of time with a lot of thought, I suppose I'd have to reconsider things. At the time, I figured I'd give it at least a few years to let it settle.

OP seems to be diving into this mindset awfully fast. It was just this past weekend. It's really not a decision that should be made urgently or in a rush. Just talk to your boyfriend and think about it. Maybe things will change for you as a couple, maybe you'll laugh this off in another week or month or whatever.

Lastly, I think /u/PirateZero makes an excellent point about seeing your boyfriend in a nurturing light. This might sound silly but...I adore my cats. My fiance had never really had pets or interacted with cats much but he knew I'd be moving them in when we got a place together, of course. The day we moved in, he was doting on the cats as much, if not more, than I do. He was on amazon buying them toys and a fancy cat tree that very day. I *love* watching him interact this way. It melts my heart when I walk in the room and he's having a chat with our cats and they're meowing back at him. I 100% understand why this would make OP feel really lovey about this!

Just keep in mind that if your boyfriend isn't interested, you have to take him out of the equation and consider if *you* want this and what that will change in your relationship if you do."
320,That's not a very fair characterization of OP. It sounds like he genuinely wants what's best for her. 
321,"if you have access sample exams, do them under actual timed conditions as test runs

you're probably a lot more resilient than you think, i know people who have done the bar exam under worse external situations than you and did fine (probably did better, because they were kind of running on autopilot instead of second-guessing themselves on each answer)

get regular sleep, exercise a lot, eat properly, go out to see a movie once or twice a week to clear your head, follow a realistic study schedule, and you'll be fine

plus, she did you a big favor in doing this now, instead of after 9 years of marriage and 2 kids, and once your start working you'll find there are a lot of interesting women out there

good luck"
322,"There's no indication that she's malicious. But yes, proper protection is reasonable."
323,"How do people manage to fuck in club/bar toilets????  The line is always insane, they're packed with people, they're disgusting, and there's usually a towel guy.  How?! "
324,"But it's far easier to believe you're just being irrational about this, right? Being irrational about his friend, who has ill feelings towards you. And it is just something you need to suck up and get over so he can come to the wedding? Um, what? Just gently put the breaks on getting married til this plays out. Because it now seems you are developing a fiancee problem."
325,"When I married my husband 10 years  ago (still married, it was real he was just foreign)  the law was we had to stay married for at least 4 years for him to be able to stay in the US. Kids had nothing to do with it."

I hope this message reaches OP. One thing her son absolutely does not need is his mum telling him how great his life, is so how can he be sad?"
328,"Quit being an asshole about putting off the proposal.  Real life isn't like the bullshit on TV and in the movies.  She's not going to care if it's perfect or not, she just wants a damn proposal already.  

Why does it have to be so *MEMORABLE*?  Being married and spending the rest of your life together is what's important - not some song and dance routine of a proposal.
"
329,"&gt; Personally, I would move forward. 

She has.  She's started a new relationship and has a good life.  She doesn't have to forget about her child or the father in order to move forward.

&gt; I would have my own support system that didn't involve an ex.

Meeting once a year to remember their daughter and mourn her loss hardly seems like a ""support system"".

"
330,"&gt; I just called her ""ridiculous"" for the tenth time and left

Gosh, I wonder why you seem to be rubbing people up the wrong way?

There may be some legitimacy to your complaints, but I think you need to take a step back and wonder why you're ending up having hostile relationships with such a wide range of people at two different schools.  Perhaps you're projecting a much more confrontational tone that you realise?  

Perhaps you could raise this with a trusted friend, ideally one who is perceptive when it comes to this sort of stuff, and ask them if there's anything you do that might come across badly."
331,"I hope so. 

I really hope she's at that point where she can't whistle past the graveyard anymore. 

It took me eleven years. "
332,"&gt;""the worst thing a man can do is awake a love in a woman with no intention of loving her back"" 

I think what they meant by that was that it's cruel to romance and woo a woman if you had no intention of ever developing feelings for them. And that is a good life lesson to have because it's bad to toy with someone's emotions. 

So don't worry because that's not what you did. You both entered a relationship fully knowing it was meant to be casual. Unless you did something like take her to expensive dinners or lighting candles with romantic music, there was no way she would misconstrue the situation. 

You did not lead her on or toy with her emotions. But it would be right to end the relationship. Clearly she sees more coming out of it. 
"
333,"This. Not to ever condone cheating but it is REALLY hard to be someone's one and only person. It seems like she grew out of this relationship and picked a shitty way to end things. 

OP, I think you focus needs to be on getting help for yourself and addressing your depression rather than this relationship right now. Let her go, it seems like she has checked out of this relationship. "
334,"Agreed. There are some  places in the world where it's literally not safe for a person of color to go. I've spoken to a few black people in the U.S. who have towns that they will go far out of their way to avoid because it's so unsafe. Even if it's not at that level of fearing for his physical well being, she's well in her right to want to protect him from verbal insults.

If these people are racist, shes actually very family focused to be cutting them out. They will be toxic, damaging influences to any children OP has with her, they will only bring pain to the people she loves. Having the awareness and foresight to skip the pain and just protect the people who matter to her is a *good* sign."
335,"It's not about the marriage necessarily, it's about him making a commitment to be with her for the foreseeable future. She can't have another kid with him if he won't commit to be in the relationship. Marriage is a promise to commit for the long-term, and he is refusing to make it. Not exactly reassuring. It's not just about the piece of paper and it is a very reasonable hill to die on. 

"
336,"He's lying to you for one of two reasons:

He's cheated with Sarah

He wants to cheat with Sarah

337,You have her that one day. That is such a gift. 
338,"Amway isn't about buying products. That is just a front to try and make it look like a business. Their business model sits in making you buy their coaching materials and attending conferences and BS. It's a cult. Depending on how deep in they are one of the first things they will be taught is not to listen to the losers (you) who can't see how brilliant they are for taking this opportunity and to ignore the haters all the while trying to turn them into a downline. 

I can't find it on youtube so they must have taken it down but there was a speech from years ago by Birdie Yager wife of one of the founders and holy hell it was bad. It was like the head of ISIS of MLM losing her shit. 

Personally I would read up a ton about it and make a checklist of their BS and give that to him. Include all the buzzwords. "
339,"Some people are only attracted to unattainable people. Once someone expresses any interest, they lose their interest. I hope that's not the case for you, though, that's an ugly trap to fall in."
340,"About a year ago, I swear I was in the EXACT same situation. I had lived with my boyfriend of about 4 years for a year and had broken up with him once before and he convinced me to resign a lease. We had some good days where I wanted to hug him and be lovey, but I was definitely checked out of the relationship. We took a ""break"" and I got my heart broken as well by another guy. I also found other guys way more attractive. I decided to finally bite the bullet and told the leasing office that I wanted to break my portion of the lease. In Texas, it was under the conditions that I would pay 2 months, move out, and then pay 85% of a 3rd month. My boyfriend screamed and cried and would beg me not to leave. It was SO sad, I still see the terrible look on his face as he was begging me not to go. He chased me for 7 months after that. I had been dating around, trying to move on. My family felt bad for him, but he never opened up, and my friends hated us together. Eventually, he found another girl on Tinder and got her pregnant. He claims they're in love now and they just got engaged. He has me blocked on everything. I do not regret leaving! A couple months after he found another girl, I met the guy I am in love with and hoping to spend the rest of my life with. I know that me and my ex are both happy in our new relationships. I know that things would have just been terrible for both of us if I stayed. I would have ended up wanting to cheat or being depressed. I stayed with my sister for months. I waited till he was at work one day and took everything I needed and put it in my car and just left. I had to surrender our dog, and that is the only thing that still tears me up about it. But, I am so in love with my current boyfriend and never thought that I would find someone as perfect as he is. Your person is out there somewhere :) Don't hold yourself back from true love and happiness because you're worried about a stupid lease or ex boyfriend or being locked out of a room."
341,"1. I don't know your parents or your culture. Unless you're Asian, in which case, good luck! 

2. You're the only one who has to live with the consequences of your decisions, so ultimately it's up to you. 

Ideally your parents will relent if you present a good, logical reason for why you want a job. They probably do want the best for you, and they are almost certainly on your side. But right now they are sheltering you too much. There is no growth without adversity, and in more practical terms, having a life of your own *will* involve budgeting, dealing with leases, deposits, credit cards, credit score, checking and savings accounts, taxes, health insurance, car insurance, etc etc., and now is as good as time as any to figure it out. And maybe save a little money for the future, although that might be difficult.

So, either develop a compelling argument, learn to push your boundaries a little, or... it's easier asking for forgiveness than permission!"
342,"Yeah tbh I don't want to dump right onto the ""dump him"" train but this woman sounds super intrusive and rude and his reaction is absolutely insane. I get him not wanting to piss off his mother but he also needs to be able to stand up for his wife and he might not be up to the task. In which case at least it's good you two aren't already married. 
"
343,"&gt; Why does Saira need you to help her stand up to her parents?

Brainwashing is a bitch and a half. Her family follows a notoriously misogynistic religion and raised her under that since birth.

She's mentally conditioned to fear them and do what they say. Just because she *realizes* this doesn't mean the hold on her is instantly broken. "
344,"she isn't making an issue, she can't help her feelings. this would be very hard for anyone to deal with. it also, whether she likes it or not, may cause some trust issues in the future. even though no one is at fault, it is what it is, and it may end up having a strain on the relationship."
345,Her funeral.  Hopefully not literally.

347,"You can definitely have a crush on someone without doing anything about it. Having a crush isn't cheating, it happens to many people in relationships. Feeding the feelings might lead to an emotional or physical affair though. But it doesn't sound like she has done that. "
348,"You started dating in high-school so you never got to experience a lot things that most people do. For instance the freedom or being single in college when you've moved away, getting your own place that is just yours, dating other people, and so on. 

It's fairly normal to feel like you've missed out, because you have. On the other hand you have had a great relationship and many people would trade their single life for that.

You need to take some time and figure out what's more important. Don't stay with her only out of guilt."
349,"&gt;I think we'd need to know more.

We know plenty.  "
350,"&gt;I had spoken with Joe unofficially on Friday

&gt;on the weekend Joe was murdered

It sounds like Joe might be trying to weasel out of the meeting to avoid having the raise conversation. Look into hiring a medium to contact his spirit in order to hold him accountable to what he said. Just make sure Jeff is present for the seance in case Joe's ghost is telling you one thing and Jeff another."
351,"Good for you going to a counselor! That's a great first step.

Now, the next important step is that you need to be *honest* with your counselor, and you need to tell them **everything** that's going on. You don't lie to your lawyer, and you don't lie to your doctor, or you wind up dead or in jail. Counselors fit under the 'doctor' clause here. Tell your counselor about the bad stuff along with the good. 

I think you should end this engagement, and possibly the relationship. Here's what *you wrote* about this relationship:

&gt;she would have an emotional blow up over things I considered to be minor 
&gt;One time she hit me
&gt;I would just let her have her way.
&gt;she has started to say a lot of hurtful things to me. 
&lt;she calls me names, threatens to leave me 
&gt;She called me all sorts of names, called her parents to tell them I was crazy 
&gt;threatened to leave me if I didn't get her a room at a high end hotel.
&gt;said that I was ""sick"" 
&gt;I was too afraid to defend myself, 
&gt;I can't handle the blow ups anymore. '
&gt;It feels like bullying. 
&gt;I also don't know how to raise this issue without instigating another blow up. 

I'm really careful about the word 'abuse', because it's so emotionally charged, and doesn't always help people do what they need to do, so you get to decide for yourself if that label applies. But here's what I will say:

**You don't sound happy in this relationship anymore!** 

Yes, things were good once, but they're not good now, and they're not getting better, and *it's not your fault!* That last bit is important: *you did nothing to deserve this, and you are not to blame!* 

There is no 'nice' way to end an engagement and break up. It will be angry and shouty and hurtful. But it's like ripping off a band-aid: it hurts, but afterwards things can be cleaned and heal. "
352,"So his feelings are more important than the 5 year old not having a cool backpack for starting school?  So his feelings are more important than having the money to sign the 8 year old up for tackle football?

Honey...he had his youth for dreams.  Now it is his kids turn.  He is a self centered boy and you need to start prioritizing your kids over his mix tapes."
353,"I think it's kind of shitty that she's the one who cheated on you, yet you're the one that's worried about comforting her..

I mean, shouldn't it be the other way around? She should be doing everything in her power to show you how much she cares about you, to make sure YOU are handling things okay, and finding out what she can do to rebuild that trust.

Instead she is avoiding you, leaving early and staying out late, and just making things worse basically.

Like a bunch of people have suggested above, I'm guessing she did a whole lot more than just kiss the guy. You said her friends told you she had disappeared for a long time until she texted them later that night to tell me she was home. I'd be willing to bet they went out to his car or back to his place for a night cap. 

After the fun happened, reality kicked in and she realized that she fucked up and is going to have to face consequences so she starts calling you trying to get ahead of all that by telling you the pg version of what really happened.

I could be wrong... that's just my opinion.  "
354,"Why did you go on the dates if you knew she wasn't okay with it?  You've said that you don't want to leave her because of the hurt it would cause - did you not think seeing other women while you were gone would hurt her as well?

Overall, you sound really selfish.  You can't have your cake and eat it too - unless she agrees to that type of relationship, which it doesn't sound like she would (or if she did, she would feel forced into it in order to keep you).  

The only fair things to do here are stop romanticizing life without your girlfriend and work on your relationship, or break up and let her find someone who truly wants to be with her."
355,"It absolutely is. He's hurting you, you told him to stop and he won't stop. I don't know how that could be defined as anything but abuse."
356,"Okay. I'm gonna lay down some serious advice for you, as someone in your age range and who has a pretty decent amount of experience, and is coming from the other side of the (heterosexual) dating pool. Please know that I am not trying to be hurtful, I just genuinely want you to succeed at dating.

There is a lot in your message that hints at an immaturity that you should have shed by your age. You mention that you don't have a lot of experience, and you are shy. Those things are both totally acceptable and cool, but when you forecast your inexperience, it can be a bit of a turnoff. Especially to women who are interested in settling down and getting married. Because it makes us wonder if your inexperience is going to translate to immaturity. And trust me, it often does. I am going to guess that your ""shit luck"" with dating is partially related to that. So, let me help you get over it!

First, the shallow but unfortunately important thing: you need to update your wardrobe. It's awesome that you have a cool t-shirt collection, but at the age of 35 you shouldn't be wearing shorts and a t-shirt on dates. Not at all. Women, especially women in LA, put lots of effort into our outfits when we are courting a guy. We pick them based on what we think you might like, what makes us feel comfortable and confident, and what flatters us. We don't expect you to preen like we do, but you HAVE to at least appear to have put in an effort. Shorts don't say effort. They're rarely flattering on men. And they also draw a lot of attention to whatever shoes you are wearing and your feet. You know all the jokes about how women love shoes? We look at shoes on men. Maybe if you are a tall babe with a model's body, and you're rocking your shorts with the freshest kicks around, you can pull off that look and not look lazy on a date. But even then, it would be hard. It's just not a nice look. On dates, you should be wearing pants and a button up shirt. You can wear jeans, but they should be well cared for - no rips, no holes, well fit to your body. Tuck your shirt in and wear a belt. You can wear sneakers, but make sure they are similarly well cared for. Don't wear your stinky gym shoes on a date. 

Next, you need to become more comfortable with yourself. Exercise, eat better, develop hobbies and interests. This stuff builds confidence, and you need it. It also gives you stuff to talk about on your dates.

Along with that, you should start making a move more quickly. A kiss on the first date is pretty standard, especially if you live in a city like LA. You don't have to jump in bed with someone (in fact, you shouldn't) but if you're not even *hugging* at the end of a date, it's not a date. You need to show your interest. Women like to be liked and to feel attractive. It feels nice. If you're not being flirtatious with Nat, she is going to think you're not interested. You'll be stuck in limbo forever because she probably won't want to make a move when she's got no indication of your interest.

Finally, you need to figure out what YOU want out of your relationship with Nat. Your description of what you want - ""a willing person"" to help you avoid ending up alone forever - is about the least romantic thing I've ever heard in my life, and if you treat Nat like a ""willing person"" then you're going to strike out. Women want to feel like you like us because of who we are, not because we check all the boxes on some imaginary form you have. What are her quirks, her favorite things? Do you like those things? Are your values similar? What are the best things about her? What are the worst? Those are the answers you should be seeking out when you date someone. You need to get to know them, and to let them get to know you. 

I have to go and this is like a million paragraphs but I hope it helped. Best of luck."
357,"&gt;is it too late?

yup.

&gt; I do love her and want it to work

Apparently not, or you'd not have done this."
358,"You have an excuse for every suggestion.

Your BF can't drive? Can't borrow a car?"
359,"I agree, as long as the contract agreement is being met your roommate has no say in he matter. This is a family issue between you and your sister! Would it make a difference if your parents were subsidizing your sister?"
360,"I would end it. Sure you could work really hard for months or years to work past it, but you could also just be single and then later on start a relationship where that's never an issue."
361,He meant online background checks that anyone can run from home. Relax.
362,He seems like the one who's more easily offended. Offended that his girlfriend is offended. 
363,"Experienced drug user here. This dude doesn't deserve a pass because he was drunk or high. Doesn't matter if the drug was unfamiliar to him. They don't take away ones agency and they didn't make him do anything he didn't want to do. The fact that he is making excuses for himself and saying ""things didn't go as planned,"" and that you seem to be buying into that line of explanation, worries me. I feel like if he were truly serious about making it up to you he wouldn't be making these weak excuses. He betrayed your trust and did a great amount of damage to the relationship. Getting over this betrayal would be a huge challenge for any couple, but you won't have a chance unless he is held fully accountable for his actions both in the past and to come."
364,"It's fucked because it's like saying ""nothing special about my husband. What?? He can walk and talk and fuck just like any other dude. He's not special!""

It implies you don't love your daughter. In fact, I haven't heard you say that. I'm not sure you feel that way. That's why people are saying to get professional help."
365,"Unfortunately I don't think you have any recourse unless something actually happens.  That being said, you are going about this in an overly dramatic crazy fashion which is likely part of the reason Rob has taken a cavalier attitude about it.

""I got a really angry and ask him to get rid of it asap""

""I got really angry and grabbed Jaden and left""

""I was fuming so I decided not to open the door""

""I couldn't breathe the whole time they were at the zoo""

""broke down crying with relief that he was okay""

Should he return the phone?  Yes, there is a national recall.  However, to date there's been about 100 phone malfunctions out of the more than 2 million sold.  Your over the top actions aren't justified.

And people do not respond well when you flip out and scream at them to make a point.  Not sure if you've ever tried therapy, but seemingly you would benefit from working on your anger &amp; anxiety.  It's difficult to communicate effectively when you are in such a worked up state."
366,"I'm 26m with an amazing fiancee. Before her though, I had 25+ sexual partners. In college i was sleeping around left and right. I got to ""sow my oats"" if you will. From my personal experience, it's highly romanticized. It's not all that great really. It's just sex and you just happen to have it with multiple people. Funny thing is the BEST one is my fiancee and its not because she's more experience or ""freaky."" It's because I love her, feelings go a long way in sex. The fact that you love your gf and she loves you means that she is the best you have right now. Don't throw that away for a chance to sleep around, not worth it man. A good girl is hard to find and if you got one, appreciate her and hang on. You're not missing out much.

Secondly, your thoughts about other women and lust for them is actually pretty normal. Even now I still get those feelings when an attractive woman checks me out and vice versa, it's normal. But what you need to remember that carnal pleasure is not happiness. What I have with my fiancee is worth so much more than sex with other people because they do not have the connection I have with her. If your girl is open to try freaky shit then you must have been a saint in the past life or sacrifice some rare animal to the gods cause most girls are not like that. Appreciate what you got brother before you lose her and she become someone else's."
367,"Brian is a Stage Five Clinger. 

You should meet up with Isaac. You're not cheating on Brian. You owe Brian zero explanation, and you shouldn't feel bad for wanting to see Isaac instead of getting pummeled to death by Brian's over the top intoxicating sweetness. 

Continue texting Brian--- at your pace. If he becomes too much I would just ghost the fuck out since you've never even met the guy in person. "
368,"I'd be mad too. Being lied to (through omission) is not a good sign. And honestly, either not being allowed to see his child, OR not wanting to see his child, are not good signs. Of course you should wait to hear him out, and maybe it turns out to be a completely innocent reason, but you need to make it clear to him that he needs to be fully transparent if he wants to be in this relationship. "
369,"""He mentioned he had a top post on a subreddit"".  I would run for the fucking hills if someone said that.  

"
370,"There are many spiteful, angry, manipulative mother-in-laws........and then there is this person that happily manipulated and abused a mentally challenged *child* in an attempt to destroy her own son's (expensive) wedding.

If this isn't in the realm of unforgivable to you, then what is?  "
371,This made me laugh so hard thank you.
372,"Yeah, I get that. But one possible outcome of saying ""I am pregnant with your child"" is that OP stays with her, but the ex is never quite able to convince herself that he decided to do that because he actually wanted to. I sure wouldn't want a life with someone where I was never sure whether they were there because they wanted to be or there because that's what they wanted to do. And that goes double for raising a child with a father who is in his life out of duty but doesn't really even want him, regardless of whether the ex and OP stayed together.  

It's a tough situation but I still think that the ex did the right thing. "
373,"A lot of people are attacking her for her ""what if one of us cheats?"" question, but considering 30-ish% of all marriages experience infidelity, it's a pretty legitimate question to ask at the beginning of a relationship. Some people are willing to forgive and work through it, some not. That's something important to talk about early on. 


You said you asked her why, what was her response? The context of the conversation is important too. Did she ask this while she was ogling some other guy or did she hear a statistic about infidelity somewhere and it made her wonder? "
374,That's actually the opposite of realistic. It's irrational.
375,"I'm a lesbian, and as progressive as the Danish government can be on many issues, many Danish people are not. I'm gonna be honest, she probably hates that you're a woman and nobody will ever change that part of her. Fuck her, just cut her out. Keep on with the FIL if you can, but I can tell you that sometimes it's better to look out for yourself than to face continually getting hurt by a shithead for someone, however lovely, who clearly doesn't care that they're staying with a shithead. 

EDIT: Seriously. A lot of Danish homophobes actually got a lot worse because of how progressive most of the people and the government are, and they really dug into their bigotry. It sucks. It really sucks. Most Danish people are amazing. Some of them are complete shits. She's a complete shit. "
376,Oh he is a lovable lil guy though. It always saddened me that you couldn't romance Deacon. He was the best &lt;3
377,"YOU DID THE RIGHT THING FOR SURE!!! He sounds like an insufferable asshole, and you are a woman of very high bullshit tolerance who does not deserve to be put through all of his crap. Go you! I'm glad that you dropped the dead weight, you deserve way better in life!"
378,"I dunno. I thought herpes wasn't a huge deal until I saw the genital herpes thread on r/sex where people described their experiences with it. Some people said outbreaks were the most painful experiences of their life, they couldn't pee or walk properly. Someone said they had to go to the hospital to deal with the pain. It's not the worst thing you could have, but I don't think we should write it off as not a big deal. And the stigma in itself is a huge deal because most people will not be willing to date a person with genital herpes, so it kinda limits your dating pool."
379,"This times 1000, the danger he put her and his unborn child in by having unprotected sex just boggles my mind. "
380,"if he's unwilling to compromise, the relationship is dead. please op, rethink this.  you deserve so much better.  end this, keep working on yourself, and find a man who wants to be your partner, not one who always wants to be right and make everything your fault."
381,"Have you two done a full genetic testing of BOTH of you?  I would put all talk on hold until after you have done this.  

P.S.  Also I would personally recommend you listen a tape of a baby crying for 4 straight hours before you even consider being alone with any baby. Can you handle that noise and pitch? I am the healthiest. mellowest person ever and when my kids would do that...well I understand shaken baby syndrome."
382,"This is really important.

Does HE call it a blanket, or do YOU?

If he is calling it a ""blankie""? Dude, no way to sugar coat that. It's like asking how to sugar coat telling someone they have a giant gaping wound in their chest."
383,"&gt; there is no way in hell she doesnt know he is like that

It's entirely possible that she knows on facts level but is in deep denial about it. Look at how some parents react/respond when told by the kid's teacher that there's a behavior problem. Working in a school I call it the ""what, not my little Johhny/Jane it must be the other kids or you""  syndrome. "
384,I'm Muslim. This is hilarious. They're not going to murder her they live in fucking Canada. 
385,"Honestly, I would take him aside and rip him a new one. Tell him you're disgusted with his behavior.  Tell him how deplorable it is that he would selfishly tell your sister, his wife, how he felt.  Tell him that in no uncertain terms would you ever want anything to do with him out side of him being a loving husband to your sister.  Tell him he better get his head out of his ass, get rid of his crush ASAP and prove to your sister that she didn't marry a horrible deplorable person.  Get mad, and show him that his confession has caused fallout.  Right now, you and your sister are made to feel uncomfortable because he couldn't keep him mouth and thoughts to himself.  Don't let him ignore what he has done to your family.  Make him face it, make absoloutly certain you find his behavior disgusting, and demand he fix his mistake."

388,"Wow. That's a lot to deal with...


You know, your family is lucky to have you, and in many ways, you're too good for them and they don't deserve you...



BUT, this can't go on forever; you're getting used up, and your life sounds like a misery. _(BTW, not sleeping can lead to all kinds of serious health issues, and it can make you literally go crazy. You don't need that on top of everything else.)_


All I can say is, try to make your wife understand how miserable you are. Ask her to help you make changes. Assert yourself. Get a professional counselor to help. 


Good luck, man..."

390,I'm sorry I have only one upvote. Brilliant. 
391,"I see what you mean. I think it's healthy to assess a relationship once in a while, and look for outside advice. 

I checked out your red flags. I think that these can be red flags, IF they are combined with other things. For example, falling for someone quickly, and expressing nice things like how comfortable you feel with them, and how happy / special they make you feel, could just be a sign of great chemistry. Now, if it's combined with, for example, showing up at your workplace all the time, getting in fights with any guy that looks at you, or telling you you're not allowed out of the house - THEN it's part of a system of abuse. 
 
As for the second ""red flag"" - him coming over a lot, and spending time together when you can. This seems perfectly normal to me! My question is - DO YOU WANT HIM TO? If you want your space, but he insists on coming over all the time, that might be an issue. If you tell him ""I'd rather have some time alone this weekend,"" and he says ""Oh, nonsense, I'll be there as always,"" that's a problem. But if you enjoy his company, and want him there, and love spending time with him too, then I see no issue. This is really about how you feel, and how respectful he is of your wishes. 

Your third ""red flag"" depends, again, on how you feel. It seems clear he's head over heels for you. But if you feel he's moving too fast, it's perfectly okay to tell him. You can say ""I care about you a lot, but this talk about the future has me feeling a little nervous. I would just love it if we could enjoy what we have right here, right now. Let's postpone talks about marriage and moving in for a few months, okay? I do want us to move forward, and I do believe we're on the same page, but for right now, talking about it is too much pressure and I just want to enjoy this great thing we have."" 
 
If he smiles and hugs you and understands, or talks to you about it to clarify, then that's good. But if he gets mad, and accuses you of wanting to cheat or leave him, or demands that you escalate the relationship faster than you're comfortable, that's a bad sign. 
 
So your ""red flags"", in and of themselves, are not necessarily red flags. But coupled with other behaviors, they can be. Make sense? 

Ask yourself: 

*  Does he respect you and your boundaries? When you say ""no"" to something does he respect your wishes?
*  Does he try to use guilt trips to get his way? Or does he express himself honestly?
*  When he does nice, caring things for you, does he demand that you reciprocate somehow, or imply that you owe him?
*  Does he use kind words, or does he call you names and belittle you?

These are just a few things to ask yourself.  
 
Hugs to you - it sucks when your trust is shaken.

392,"It sounds like you live at home and your parents are very controlling. It also sounds like you live at home, what is preventing you from moving out and doing as you wished with your time and money?"
393,"He has his space, hobbies and friends, you have your space, hobbies and friends, you dont have to spend all day together chatting and texting, but as long as you have eachother to chill with in the evenings, to talk about days, or little things happening in your lives, with friends/family hobbies, then it's fine, and perfectly normal 

Just don't overthink and overanalyse when you're apart! "
394,"A lot of women can't orgasm with a partner, either at all or for a while, because the sensations just aren't right. In your case, what was probably initially just ""new to sex"" has probably been exacerbated by the abusive attitudes of your first two partners.

If he's wonderful, he's not going to react like that. I would definitely tell him so that he knows it's a thing, and I know you're going to be scared while you're doing it, but if he's a caring person he's not going to be mean to you. Tell him that you have no trouble orgasming by yourself but you've never had an orgasm with a partner, you don't know if it'll ever happen (some people don't), but you wanted him to know. Say that you're happy to experiment with him to figure out what will get you there. :) Chances are if he watches you some to figure out what works for you and then you guys experiment some and you don't feel any pressure about it, it'll be fine."
395,"She sounds curious. My friends and I also ask each other about our lives. It doesn't sound like she is into you, IMO. "
396,"Oh for fucks sake. This is first world middle class poverty we are talking about. Eating home cooked meals and buying makeup on sale for a few weeks is HORRIFYING I KNOW, but people somehow survive."
397,"Odds are he also has a more profitable degree. There's a reason you pay a premium, it's because people consider it worth it. 

The point is he already got a gift quite a bit larger earlier. That he choose a more expensive route shouldn't mean he gets the Lions share. At least that seems to be OPs logic. Some people see frugality as something to be rewarded.

"
398,"You've got a 30 year old guy mooching off you, a teenager.  Tell him to find his on place and to do it quickly.  He's taken advantage of you for two months. "
399,"&gt; my SIL revealed that she had hooked up with her high school sweetheart when she and my brother were separated. It was a one-time thing. She blocked and deleted that guy on every platform and hasn't seen or spoken to him since. Even so, my brother got really jealous. I guess her ex is a sore spot for him? Comparisons, etc. I don't know. 

They were separated. That's the whole point.

&gt; I know it's not my place in terms of their marriage.

Not true...

&gt;  But she's a friend and a member of our family.

...because of this. She's your family too. He's hurting part of your family.

I'm real proud of you OP, you're good people."
400,"1,000x this. I think you'd be well within your rights to walk away right now, but it sounds like you love him and want to make it work — which means presenting the choice in a productive way.

So step 1 can be an ultimatum not between music and you, but between honing his craft in a responsible, diligent, probably more solitary and DEFINITELY less costly way, and continuing to do what he is doing, which is not only costing you two your financial future, but also the kids.

How he responds to that will tell you a lot about what he actually values about his hobby/passion."
401,"Wait.. So she has a job... And you're mad that she's prioritizing the thing that determines your wedding date over.... Changing jobs. When she has a good job right now.... And she has no idea when she would be moving if she doesn't know when her wedding date is.....

You need to chill."
402,you didn't care about her making moves on you but your ex did. you should have shut that shit down and not hangout with her out of respect for your ex.
403,If he does this in the wrong place he will end up on the registry when he's older
404,Thanks for this wonderful glimpse into idiocy.
405,"You don't take babies one day at a time. You plan ahead. This means, before this baby gets too big to abort, you tell your parents what is going on. Like now."
406,The problem is your wife and her family. Baby sister has always been this way because they allow it.
407,"This is what surprise me. Yes, you have every right to feel embarrased, but that's not a reason to argue. Also, the bf handled this like a champ! He's a great guy.

Op, I can see a bit of myself in you. You feel like you can't accept someone's help because you're worrird that you will only bother them. After all this year something that I learned is that when your partner is doing something good for you don't say ""no"" or ""sorry"", but ""I love you"" and ""thanks"". He was sweet and caring and you shit all over his good intentions. He was doing all that for you, to make you feel comfortable and happy. You mentioned in another post that your ex would had gone furious in this situation, so maybe you have some left over fear from that. Work on fixing that and learn to appreciate the things that your bf does for you.

Now, is time to prepare/buy his favorite dinner,a bottle of his favorite drink and have a wonderful home date as a thanks."
408,It's weird to even invite them tbh. 
409,Nope. 21 goes into 42 twice. I disagree with the original point but just felt like correcting this.
410,That's so incredibly selfish. Did you seriously not see this coming? His poor sister has experienced tragedy that will follow her for life and he absolutely needs to care for her. You can break up with him for it but don't insist he abandon her. He will resent you for the rest of your life. 
411,"Honestly, I would do the same thing. 

You shouldn't HAVE to. Its not fair to you. Your partner is supposed to be your teammate and when you cannot trust them it is like having a double agent for a partner. "
412,"Yes. Exactly this. You know that he has told everyone in his friend circle about this and will demand that the OP uses the purse whenever they go out together. 

"
413,"&gt; I think he likes to throw his money around, and he's slotting you into the ""girlfriend"" hole in his life, and buying you things he gets the body occupying the ""girlfriend"" position, and he's not only not interested in who you actually are and what you actually like, but he's mocking what you like, and expecting you to change your preferences.

&gt; To me, this seems disappointing for many reasons. You're not any girl. You're you. He should want to get to know you, rather than demanding you appreciate what he believes ""any girl"" should. Or else you should ditch him and let him find a better ""any girl"" to fill that place in his life. Not like he'll notice the difference.

Man, this is insight that slices to the bone and makes your insides gasp at how severe it cuts...wow.
"
414,"I am a survivor of sexual trauma (and other childhood traumas) and I know it is easy to feel like you can't trust people or be in a relationship or have what ""regular people"" have.


 I think that people and circumstances come into our lives to help us learn and grow in some way. This relationship is proof that you CAN do those things, and maybe it's served its purpose in your life and healing? It will hurt, but you can and will have better, more fulfilling relationships than you ever thought possible. Good luck and all the internet hugs."
415,"In the world of cheating, what you did was mild.  Plus you immediately felt bad and confessed.  What he's demanding of you is totally out of the question.  It's definitely creepy, and you shouldn't go along with it.  If that means you cheated and then you're gonna leave him, then so be it.  His creepy controlling nature would've surfaced whether or not you went out to dinner with this other guy.  You screwed up, but you don't have to put up with his ridiculous demands. "
416,"You should. It sounds sensationalized but it's not, it's quite dangerous. Pretty common for criminals to just patrol neighborhoods and learn the routines of people in various houses so they can rob them. I've heard this from multiple police officers. I would've thought that people only do that in movies before a big heist, but trust me, this is real life stuff that happens to everyday people. If you live in a high crime area you probably have had someone hang out around your house just to look for juicy details like a ""secret"" key that people are constantly picking up.

At the very least she should be constantly moving the position of the key."
417,Used your kid to get into this. Use your kid to get out. But man... You need to realize you did this because you wanted someone to take care of your daughter and it turned out very wrong.
418,"It does seem to be something they're born with. Some people (researchers) say ~1% of the population is a ""psychopath"".

For the record, this guy probably didn't fit the criteria for psychopathy. He must have felt deeply attached to the (ex)gf and psychopaths tend to be ""cool and aloof"". Although he does seem to have been self absorbed and lack empathy... 

I'd diagnose him with ""being kind of an obsessive dickhead who was in a lot of distress and had very poor coping skills"" if it were up to me."
419,"Do you have proof of that incident? 

&gt; He once found cp on a computer he was working on and reported it to a number, as required by the job. The FBI was alerted and questioned him relentlessly, as if they suspected him of being the culprit.

Why would the FBI question him relentlessly and suspect him when he a) worked in IT b) could prove this computer wasn't his and give them the name of whose it was c)called a mandatory report number  and d) being the FBI, very easily find out when the stuff was downloaded, make a timeline etc and very quickly see it wasn't him. 

This reeks of bullshit. 

When did he tell you about the above incident out of interest? "
420,"My mom is like this and my dad is dealing with the repercussions decades into their marriage. Honestly, get out while you can, this is textbook manipulative behavior with some aspects of emotional narcissism. "

Instead of telling her she isn't #1 and to just deal with it, assure her that you love/d both equally in different ways. If that feels like a lie then you have a strange way of dealing with things.

I know you feel trapped because you believe you need him for your immigration status, but there has to be another way. Please do some research and speak to a lawyer that specializes in immigration law. 

Check out loveisrespect.org as well.

432,"&gt;  It's not worth having more disposable income if he's going to be miserable at a higher paying job.

If he isn't paying rent, only covering a third of the bills, and has no savings, he has plenty more disposable income than a typical person who stays in a lower paying career by choice. There's nothing wrong with making that choice, but it sounds like he's deriving a lot of benefits from OP's harder work and much higher earnings. "
433,"&gt;I don't hate my wife and in fact want her to be happy. 

What a terrible husband you are. get it together."
434,"If you wait until she's 30 to start trying, she will be at least 31 before she gives birth, and that's assuming everything goes *well*.  Assume you run into troubles with fertility. Assume it could take months or years to fall pregnant, not to mention the 9 month gestation. Keep in mind that she may have a miscarriage before a pregnancy sticks. If you wait, it's far more likely she could be 32, 33, even 34 before she gives birth to your first child. 

Keep in mind that a newborn baby isn't handed to you the day you say ""I'm ready to have a child."" Getting pregnant takes time, as does being pregnant. You will still have plenty of time to enjoy the *now* whilst you and your girlfriend are also making an effort to get pregnant. And if there are issues with fertility, you will both need as much time as you can get on your side.

You can enjoy the now, but don't be greedy by wanting *years* to enjoy the now. Life will throw curve-balls at you anyway, so make an effort to get the ball rolling. Propose, and do it sooner rather than later (I think January might be too far to wait). Plan your wedding and enjoy your honeymoon. That alone will eat up 1-2 years anyway. The more you wait, the more you risk losing your girlfriend.

438,"You mentioned your diet being an issue with your dad. How is your diet? I ask because something similar happened to my ankle. No injury I could recall, but I started having severe pain and was limping. Turned out I had a severe vitamin D deficiency. It took me months and several different doctors to get a diagnosis because it wasn't an obvious cause for ankle pain. It really strikes me as *extraordinarily odd* that you could have sprained your ankle so badly without noticing any injury. Doctors often assume the most common cause for a symptom and don't dig deeper unless treatment doesn't work. I would get a second opinion, stressing that you do not recall injuring yourself and I would ask for bloodwork."
439,"Based on your post history: You said no to an open relationship, she went ahead with one anyway. Your marriage is over.

How old are your kids? They do deserve, at some point, to know that your marriage ended because she betrayed her vows, but the most important thing is making sure they know that both of you still love them, and being civil to her. "
440,"I'd go through CPS first- they'll give you support for talking to the police if that's what should happen.  OP will have to talk to the child's parents though, to see what they want, because it will be their call with their child. 

Personally, I've got two kids with developmental disabilities, and I'd be beyond furious. Not just for the initial abuse (I don't ever want my kids learning how to make themselves throw up), but because it can take a long time to extinguish that kind of behaviour, depending on the kid.  I feel sorry for OP and her wedding, but I hope that the family sees that the real issue is how cruel the grandmother was to a child who had no way to protect herself.

441,"She's not the girl for you. Somewhere, there's a guy who hates that his girlfriend is always pulling him off the couch after a long day at work. After 8 years, she's not going to become an active extrovert."
442,"If he's drinking so much soda, eating so much candy and sweets, and drinking so much beer that she has to say ""hey babe, maybe you should slow down a bit"" i doubt it's him being perfectly healthy. He probably DOESN'T eat any vegetables which might be why she says something. 

My husband LOVES Taco Bell, LOVES his steaks, drinks a good amount of beer each day etc and I have told him ""hey let's cut back on this Taco Bell/steak"" or something along those lines. I DO tell him ""babe grab some of these vegetables"" because when I cook a full meal he doesn't take any of them. He doesn't realize how many beers he has had until I ask him how many he has had, ""Well this is my 4th one, but I had a couple of pitchers with the guys on the way home. So... about 8 I guess. Oh shit, yeah."" He plays guitar with my brother so my brother and him will sit in the garage and play and they don't realize how many beers they've had or cigarettes they've smoked until they're out. 

Recently we had a big health scare with him because of all of that crap, rectal bleeding, had to go in for a colonoscopy, etc. and the doctor told him that he needs to increase his fiber, decrease red meat, and drink less alcohol. So it isn't likely ""controlling every aspect of his life"", it seems as a legitimate concern for his well being, especially considering they were talking about having kids. "
443,"Ahh sounds like my ex wife. Nothing was ever her mistake. Nothing. Always someone elses problem or just mine.

All i can say is good luck. After 15 years i was tired of crap like that"
444,"You aren't being unreasonable,. She is.  You can't help her grow up, only she can.

This isn't a problem in the relationship that you can fix together.  This is all her, pushing the blame on to you, throwing tantrums, and using the silent treatment to punish and manipulate you.  Her ideas about men being supposed to read women's minds and make them feel better is utter bullshit.

She had mental health issues you can't fix.  She has archaic and sexist beliefs you can't fix.  She is manipulative and uses passive-aggression in a way you can't fix.  She treats you with contempt and like you are stupid, and you can't fix that.

As someone who struggled through 9 years of depression, I can tell you she should not be dating.  She is not managing her illness adequately and she is way out of line with how she treats you.  You need to walk away."
445,"Yes, you should speak to a therapist who can help you. I have no idea why your boyfriend thinks there ""isn't therapy for that"". There is therapy for EVERYTHING, even if it seems trivial. The therapist can help you find strategies to manage your stress, relax, and become less anxious and controlling in a professional, understanding, and impartial way. I absolutely recommend it!"
446,"&gt;What happens whenever you have children? 

OP will have inlaws so far up her ass that she'll chew second, and any attempt to be a mom with healthy boundaries will be met with a freakout backed up by her husband. 

Don't get pregnant, OP. "

449,"ye idk why people are giving u a hard time. he is trying to do his best to appear polite, rather than taking the time to understand why some things are done and when they are done. like someone trying to make sure they appear 100% christian, but in reality being the opposite. tell him he is being rude to u by ignoring what u are saying, and that at some point he is going to have to prioritize someone feelings over another persons. at the moment he is really not really doing anyone any favors..."
450,"&gt; the stay at home mum who is incapable of the logistics of managing yourself and your family

Wow.  Even if OP *is* a SAHM it seems wildly unrealistic to assume that a SAHP is incapable of either of those things.  It is most certainly not an aspect of being a SAHP in my view (though I am not one myself).  That you equate that with it is so far from my understanding of that dynamic that I'm kind of fascinated that you do.

It's far more likely that she is simply in shock from such a traumatic shift in her life, which can make the most incredibly capable of us feel like we're floundering and don't know what to do next."
451,"I would casually bring it up that you were curious why he was following 150 local college girls.  I would be weirded out if my husband did that.  Don't become confrontational about it, he honestly could be admiring their bikini bodies and nothing more than that."
452,"You guys sound like a bunch of teenagers, not 23-year olds. You've been a bad friend, Anna has been around you long enough that she's realised this, and your other friends are just exacerbating the issue by ""taking sides"". Jess doesn't know Anna at all so I would ignore any ""interpretation"" that comes out of her mouth. Sara has betrayed Anna's trust by reporting back to you, and is also a shit friend for encouraging your pettiness.

Anna *does not* want to be your friend anymore, and rightfully so. Leave her alone and if she wants to continue the friendship, let it be on her terms. Quite frankly if she has any sense she wouldn't - I certainly wouldn't want to be caught up in all thus. 

You also need to learn how to balance friends and boyfriends because boyfriend &gt; friend isn't always true. Also, start practising mindfulness - you're not the only person whose opinions and interests exist and matter."
453,"Exactly. You don't marry/commit to family for life, you do however, marry/commit to your SO."
454,"It's good that he apologized and realized it's a really shitty thing of him to do, but I must say I've never hated something a significant other wears SO MUCH that it's changed my mood as soon as I see them in it. That's just bizarre. I'd definitely have a SERIOUS talk with him about how much it hurts you and how immature it is. If he can't realize it's a material thing and that it doesn't change YOU as a person, I think you should break up with him. It's not fair that he makes you feel so horrible over something so stupid and immature. "
455,Please just finish with Annie so she doesn't have to bother. 
456,"Well, this isn't a HIPAA violation, but it is worrying and obviously very hurtful."
457,"Yeah, it's totally the jealousy not the violent abusive streak that we should primarily concern ourselves with. "
458,"&gt; a history

That ""history"" was a single trip. OP recognizes that texting-only was a mistake, and has promised to make up for it. She also doesn't mention the boyfriend calling *her* a single time. Why shouldn't he have the responsibility to communicate in the way he wants to when they're apart?"
459,"Forget about the fee and just tell her what your boundaries are for him staying over. Tell her what the hard line is. 7 nights a month and that's it. There shouldn't be a time when he stays anymore than that without expressly discussing and planning it with you. Is the money the issue or is it that she wants him to spend more time over than that? It doesn't sound like money is the real issue for either of you. You need to talk about a compromise over the real issue, how often he is spending the night. "
460,"&gt; I think the larger issue here is she is actively doing something to seek out attention at work 

why do we have to make that assumption? woman can want to dress sexy without looking for attention from men. maybe she just finds the outfit fun, and the added tips will be nice?"
461,"My fiancé holds down a career and still has the time and opportunity to play in 2-3 bands AND book and play shows. He's trying to ""make it"" the wrong way, but his business practices are neither here nor there. It's fine for him to have a hobby. It's not fine for him to sacrifice his family's financial well being for it. It's time to have a serious chat with him and lay out the particulars of your finances and retirement options. "
462,"This is very simple. The image of her you have in your head is nothing like the actual person she is. She thinks nothing of cheating on you, she would drop you for her ex in a heartbeat and she lies through her teeth to you. When she tells you your the man of her dreams she's only doing so because she doesn't want to be alone. 

Don't be a chump. Dump her, go no contact, spend a couple of months working on yourself, then find someone better (which is a very low bar). "
463,"Thank you, I really appreciate that! :)
Her best friend is actually my little sister(who I care for, as well) who is her ""sister."" They are complete opposites, one is covered in mud and the other is covered in glitter, but they make it work. 

I'll look into those books, the name sounds so familiar but I can't put my finger on it. I might of read them, I've always been a book worm. "
464,"That should have been a big massive red flag right there, but you liv and learn."
465,"Would spraying him with a water bottle be out of line? I mean, it doesn't address the underlying weirdness but it'll get him to stop surely?"
466,"&gt; What do?

Talk to her about it. Explain why you think it's inappropriate and have a conversation about it. "
467,"You might want to go to the police before you talk to your parents about how mad you are at them. If you were in the US, I'd expect they'd end up talking to the cops first and prepping them to downplay it and get the police to try to keep you from filing charges. No idea if that kind of thing could be true there too."
468,"I'm at a very different point in my life, being 40 and in a very long term relationship with several children. This situation you're talking about nearly killed our relationship, but we got it resolved in the end.

For us if we didn't schedule sex then it would never happen. Neither of us have particularly high drives, and when you have kids and a busy life there's often not the time. Scheduling a certain time every week as 'possible sex time' works well for us. Often neither of us is that bothered, but at least it's there as a potential plan rather than a daily procrastinating chore.

But more than the schedule, what worked the best for us is to remove all pressure from it. By that I mean you need to feel free to initiate at any time, but be OK with no being the answer, and to not feel guilty about saying no because you're not in the mood. It's also OK to get a bit sexy, like maybe just touching non-sexually, or maybe some sexual touching, but without expecting anything more. If either of the couple doesn't want to go further, then don't. If one of the couple needs to release tension and masturbate, then they shouldn't feel judged or guilty. Realise it's not a rejection of you if the other isn't into it at that moment, and realise not rejecting if you aren't receptive right now. 

Don't get into 'mercy sex'. You end up resenting it, and your partner doesn't enjoy it because you're not into it, and everyone ends up more frustrated. 

It's all about honest consent really - actually wanting what's offered right now, not because you feel coerced, guilty, or you 'should' go along with it, but because it's a really nice way of expressing your love for each other. Show your love in other ways, learn love languages, do other stuff too.

It's easy to build up this layer of sexual anxiety / tension which is hard to resolve and tends to build over time, the above stuff really cuts through all that, and often means you get more intimate more often because there's less pressure. We've gone from having a lot of tension and frustration over it, to actually having some low-level sexual-type activity most days. Usually it doesn't ramp up much, but we actually find that very satisfying for both of us."
469,But relationships aren't sum averages. You don't put in days/weeks of great behavior and in return you can then afford a couple hours of shittiness. Relationships are more like chains - strength determined by the weakest link. Take any team sport/competition. Who succeeds? The team that cooperated perfectly when things were going well but turned on each other the second things got tough or the team that cooperated maybe less perfectly but consistently throughout even the toughest times.
470,This sounds like a disassociate email mental disorder. Seek help. That is he's a shapeshifter.
471,"&gt; she wants me to spend 400$ on a weekend for us every month.

Da fuq you doing on weekends? can i come?"
472,"Absolutely.  Don't let your mother play her shitty, shitty triangulation games with your grandma. "
473,"Nope, but the person I replied to was telling someone to intentionaly live in poverty so they could save money, then go back to living paycheck to paycheck once they had some money saved up."
474,"This doesn't apply to all the situations you've listed, but is an important consideration:

I've worked in tutoring (never for myself, though, always with a company), and they tend to be very big on never being alone with the students. For example, I could work with someone in their home, and their parents didn't necessarily have to be in the same room, but someone did need to be around. I appreciated the hard-line approach the companies took with this (I had to bring forms the first day that the parents signed, where they understood the boundaries), because it took any emotion or awkwardness out of asserting what I would or would not be able to do.

It sounds like you've got a good rapport with this family, and that many of the issues a tutoring agency may worry about are not applicable, but it is still worth considering. For one, it lets you create a hard boundary that applies to many situations where you're going above and beyond your role as a tutor, and second, it protects you personally from certain unlikely, but catastrophic, situations which could occur. For example, if you were in a car accident while driving to art night, or if he got sick while you were working with him at home.

It's a tricky situation, but you've got to evaluate what your role is, and create boundaries in line with that role. Tutor has one set of roles, babysitter has a different set. The role of legally representing someone (for example, by signing forms for them or attending parent conferences) would be the role of an attorney, which is not necessarily something you want to take on.  "
475,"Telling a Saudi Arabian woman what Saudi Arabia and its people are like isn't advice, and that was my only issue with it. 

The focus should have been on her and her specific situation, not sensationalist stereotypes about the culture that she comes from."
476,"Ok.  When my ex wasn't doing his share (he was also unemployed) I told him that yes, I could do all of the kid work and my job, like a single mom.  But if I had to do that, I would do it as a single mom.  This actually made sense to him, he understood and stepped up, started cooking the meals and other stuff that helped a lot. 

I know you want him to empathize but even if he can't, maybe he can understand it as a scheduling problem.  You need (need not want) to build time for yourself into the weekly schedule.  I go running in the morning early while nobody needs me but ALSO some days go to yoga in the evening and someone else takes care of making dinner.

He is letting you down.  Tell him exactly what to do, exactly what you need to make it work.

And when the baby comes, he does know he will have to do everything you are doing now while you recover, right?

I second the recommendation for a weekly cleaning service too.  If he won't work and you can't manage, put it in the budget.   Twins AND a newborn?  Hiring help is absolutely reasonable in this situation.

You can outsource laundry too, local people come pick it up and bring it back all clean and folded.

You want to work and love your job, do it, and let others make money helping you, pass it on.



"
477,"That is unfortunate.  Can't see him as a villain because it is a generous gift, but it's bordering on the other end of shitty gift giving.

That rare situation where the gift just shows they don't really know you and is more of a burden simply because it is so expensive.

But you sound like a dick if you complain :("
478,"So her sister listens in on all your phone conversations, she says casually racist/racially charged remarks, she blows up on you, you've been on two dates, and this relationship has only been going on for three months? I feel it's probably an accurate assessment that you're very timid in this relationship, because there's no reason for you to continue talking to this girl who seems crazy and will continue to trample over you and blow up worse and more frequently the longer you're together. Shit, 3 months? You weren't even dating on the 4th of July, it's not like this is a marriage you're trying to save. Have some respect for yourself."
479,"finish whatever box you're doing now then go see your grandma.

technically speaking, you've actually got 30 days to move (most places, depends on local laws, even if you don't have a lease with your name on it) so don't worry about that right now.

you can deal with your ex later, you're gonna be just fine."
480,"&gt;I talked to my brother and he said he’d cover my story, but it’s quite easy to know I lied as I was never in hospital around that time, nor did I stop hanging out with friends and such. Daniel could easily figure it out, especially as he’s becoming more sociable again and we share the same social circle. 

I'm not sure of that. I usually don't advocate lying, but this lie really helped him. Sometimes people come close to attempting and don't go in for inpatient treatment - if you had actually done this at the time, it's plausible that no one around you might have known. Some depressed people, especially people with a plan to attempt, are *really* good at hiding those feelings and remaining socially functional. 

Do you think Daniel would understand why you lied? or would he become angry and go into a tailspin? This question is more about his temperament and personality - you know him best. What do you think?"
481,"If you're going to tell her, do it anonymously so it doesn't come back to bite you in the ass."
482,You are either very naive or you are another Xander. When I was 23 I would have ****NEVER**** thought Xander wanted to date me. Not in ten billion years would I have thought that. 
483,"You don't have a formal diagnosis, you aren't on medication, and you aren't taking any other measures to cope with your (possible) ADHD, so from where your boyfriend is standing you probably just look lazy and inattentive. I can understand why he's pissed, especially when your behavior results in damage to his belongings.

To be blunt, *if* you have ADHD, it sounds like you haven't taken responsibility for dealing with it, and like you're using your self-diagnosis as an excuse."
484,jesus tapdancing Christ.
485,"&gt; now all I feel towards her is contempt

Well, there's no moving past this.  The relationship is dead.  Move on.

&gt; I am actively involved in the pickup community

You know the phrase 'you are what you eat'?  Just like fast food leads you towards an early grave due to obesity, being a PUA leads you towards being contemptuous towards women.

Look, this misunderstanding was caused by YOU thinking that because she was said that sex was off the table you weren't going to meet up at all.  You did that.  You're the reason the date was cancelled.  

Then her thinking (not unreasonably given your PUA background and the way the previous dates have gone) that you were only interested in sex leading her to think that you had incompatible goals.  And you know what?  You DO have incompatible goals.  You treat women with contempt and basically aren't relationship material."
486,"It's not even a solution anyway. It's just telling her what she should have done in the past, which doesn't help her situation now. He basically just wanted to put her down it seems. "
487,"&gt; On that morning I convinced myself that i owed it to myself to take this chance. But I have felt guilty ever since.

&gt;I'm not this kind of guy. It just happened.

You're kidding right? No it didn't 'just happen', and yes you *are* that kind of guy. You knew exactly what you were doing. Your girlfriend deserves to be with someone who respects her which you obviously do not. Tell her so she can decide if she wants to break up with you, which I'm sincerely hoping she does because she deserves better. "
488,Dunno why you're getting downvoted. My parents divorce cost me my college fund. Thanks 'rents! 
489,Wait is there something wrong with blankie? I'm a 23/M and I call my comforter my blankie.
490,"&gt; stop calling her your ""step-daughter"".  That sounds so alienating.

That's a little unfair, and I really doubt that's contributing the problem.  It's an accurate term, it's not a pejorative, and she probably seldom uses it in day-to-day life.  She had to identify Beth as a step-daughter for our benefit to make the relationships clear, but then she goes on to call her by name for the rest of the post.  In real life, she probably calls her by name 99.9% of the time, unless she's introducing her to a stranger."
491,"Hummm, look at it a different way, it's possible that your in-laws had trouble conceiving and by roping in the younger brother they were able to have a wanted kid. 

If that was the plan from the get-go it'd be less creepy, either way, Alex is who matters and Alex has a pile of adults who love him. This is the important bit. The kid has a weird conception, but ultimately he's fine. 

Also, you obviously *can't* keep a secret."
492,"Just here to point out that a vagina is a MUSCLE. There's no way she's too loose, it tightens and expands, and during sex it expands when she's turned on. Basically, you're complaining shes enjoying the sex you two are having and her body is reacting positively. Bloody ridiculous. If we can pop a watermelon sized baby out of there and have it go back to normal, your dick ain't gonna do shit, no matter how ""big"" it is. Get your head out of your own ass (and stop fisting her, what the hell are you doing that for, no wonder she doesn't want to have sex). "
493,"&gt;Randomly asking me when I'm due or whether it's a boy or a girl. I didn't tell you I was pregnant in the first place. It's none of your business.

This made me chuckle. "
494,"So a good tip for people who tend to think of themselves as less than others, is to take a step back, and imagine this was happening to a friend.

Would you say to your friend (who came to you and told you this story) that they're right, no one would believe them? Would you suggest that your friend keep their mouth shut about frankly bizarre situations like this? 

Treat yourself as your own friend. It can be a little challenging at the start,  and you might not be able to do it in the moment, but even if your thoughts about the situation change after it's happened, it's a victory for you. 

Also if you're looking for a supportive sub, head over to r/raisedbynarcissists "

496,"I love how he acts like he knows what boundaries are, yet in one short bit of dialogue, shows he doesn't have the slightest clue. "
497,"Not at all, if she's really busy.

When I or my SO am away for work, we try to call in once a day at bedtime for 5 minutes, but sometimes it's too late (or time zone is bad) so we miss a day. 

If she is busy (having fun or working) 6 hours to return a text is nothing to worry about - she is BUSY ffs.

You are coming across needy!"
498,"&gt;Well no, and I realize that, but I guarandamntee the school will take it seriously to be sure it isn't. 

Or they'll see the student using big words he doesn't understand and assume he's a drama king. The joke was offensive on its own and worth discussing. There's no good reason to dress it up in official language that doesn't apply. If I got an email from a student raving about a faculty member breaking HIPAA, I'd still take the issue as seriously as it needed to be taken, but it would certainly color my opinion of the student and not in a good way."
499,"Holy shit, I feel so bad for whoever gets stuck with you."
500,"I know it probably seems to good to be true, and that plenty of women have probably rejected you because of your height, but there really are women out there who don't care, and this girl seems like one of them.

You'll always regret it if you don't see where this leads. Assume everything is at face value, meet up with her and see where it goes. Don't overthink it. 

As far as what to say or do, you treat her just like you would any of your friends. She's just a person. Talk to her and relate to her as a person, not some alien being that you don't understand how to behave around. Take an interest in her life, hobbies, interests, etc., and she'll probably ask you about yours. If you know how to have conversations with friends, you know how to have a conversation with her."
501,"Just because you THINK she ""knew what you meant"" doesn't mean she had to put your feelings first. You weren't dating her. You ""weren't straight"" and didn't tell her, and then you decided to sulk when she didn't read your mind or return your feelings exactly the way you believed she ought to. You don't get to act like she has to take your feelings into consideration when it comes to who she dates/sleeps with. YOU HAD NO CLAIM TO HER, she is a person and she gets to make those decisions, regardless of what you wanted. You reek of entitlement.

Also, you see her differently because she had sex with someone else? I bet it'd be just fine if it had been you. Or if it was a guy friend of yours that you saw having sex -- would a dude friend of yours owe you any consideration in  having sex with somebody else? Because she owed you the exact same amount, none.

Think of it this way: If a girl liked you but you didn't know (or simply didn't like her back), would you think it was OK if she was acting like a kicked puppy and insulting you because you slept with someone else? Saying she couldn't see you the same way (like you're somehow ""tainted,"" which is so fucking sexist I can't even wrap my brain around it) and acting like she had some claim to your body and/or affection -- why? Because she decided her feelings mattered more than yours? This is what you are doing, and it's gross.

There's no fixing this. You feel butthurt by her, she's hurt by you, game (and ""friendship""* over). * I don't think you ever had a friendship with her because clearly it was all about getting with her. Don't pretend to be someone's friend and then get angry when you don't get a romantic relationship out of it. If you want to date someone, ask them out, but don't act like you're their friend and then get pissed when they don't behave the way you want."
502,Because you responded like a fucking freak.
503,"Pointing out that something may not be a solution is not ""completely shitting all over the advice"". If OP's MIL is insensitive and self absorbed enough to go to a woman who just suffered a stillbirth and outright say ""your loss isn't as bad as my loss 25 years ago because you only lost one baby AND you get time to grieve"", there is a very, very slim chance that she will accept any sort of logical approach to her backing off.

As many others have said in this thread, MIL needs a firm direct approach and some therapy to address why she's taking over a situation in which she is not the main focus."
504,"You fucked up. You hid for 2 years that you aborted his baby. Even though it's your body and the decision to abort or keep is yours, he's still the father, and he doesn't have to approve of your decision.

Let him digest the news and then wait for his decision, that's all you can do."
505,"Why do you want to stay in this relationship?
"
506,"Don't do it when you're upset, do it calmly after the fact. It's really hard to do in the heat of the moment. 

It is a red flag though like all the other users are posting. The next time she goes to therapy you damn well better tag along no matter what. "

508,"A husband I know baked bomb ass cinnamon rolls for their family wide baby shower, not just ladies, grandparents, and parents were there too. So were uncles to the baby. "
509,"Used to do a bunch of autopsies. SIDS death and second hand smoke was third to parents in bed with baby and too many covers for me. Making the pathologists life easier is a bad idea. The scene investigators are going to note whether the parents smoke and whether it occurs in the house.

You wanna have edibles, whatever. Assuming a moderate intake of both, there's a decent chance the brownie is worse for you than the THC."
510,"I mean, Japan does have a negative population growth."
511,You should read her post history. Looks like she has all sorts of stress/anxiety/social problems outside of her relationship issues.  I think OP might want to consider seeing a therapist to get herself well. The loss of libido could be related to her apparent poor mental health.
512,"I'm not sure if it makes a difference for you, but I assume there were an equal number of bridesmaids and groomsmen in the end (or you would have noticed earlier that something was fishy). It sounds like one possibility is she realized she needed to cut two bridesmaids out of her wedding party, THEN decided on you two based on that (shallow) justification."
513,"And that is well within your rights. I do not think it was fair of him to assume you would be on board, which is why I believe he should have spoken to you.

You are in the unhappy place where you need to decide if you are  willing to assist in parenting his sister, and keep your husband, or divorce. Unfortunately, I do not see a third option."
514,"I'm the same way, I could go on and on about various off-the-wall topics that I have uselessly gone into deep research mode on. Lol

And thank you, your assumption is correct. All I want for her is happiness, no matter what person she matures into. She will always be loved and supported by me. "
515,"OK, well, depending on what your SIL did the answer to this may change, but the key problem here seems to be your father.  It sounds to me like your brother (pretty understandably) decided he didn't want to be under your parents' control for the rest of his life, made a clean break, and moved far away.  

That ideal, close family you are hoping for? I think you need to figure out how to let go of that.  I don't mean that you need to cut people off, here.  What I mean is that ""family closeness no matter what"" is *not* a value your dad holds if he's willing to cut off his own grandchild because he's holding a grudge.  You want to remain close to your family, but your brother's example has shown that that closeness is conditional, and can be revoked if you don't dance to your dad's tune.

For yourself, I think you need to figure out how to detach a little bit, as you are really internalizing your family's conflict in a way that is not good for anyone.  It doesn't benefit you, and it doesn't affect the situation.  I agree with you that family therapy probably will not happen, but *individual* therapy for yourself could be extremely beneficial in terms of giving you tools to navigate your family's situation.  Good luck."
516,"Exactly. My partner and I split household duties. Late last night after we got home from our respective soccer games, I said I would do the dishes. Instead, I fell asleep. So first thing this morning before I left for work, I did them. My partner offered to do them for me (he doesn't need to leave as early as I do), but I said nope, this is my responsibility. I said I would do them, so I did. "
517,"What is so bad about laundry?   I think its the easiest chore but i don't fold my clothes,  i just shove them in the appropriate drawers lol."
518,Had to do this with a close friend. He got addicted to meth and was hospitalized. They also diagnosed him with schizophrenia. But he won't get treatment for either issue and thinks it's a conspiracy against him. Our group of friends tried for a long time to try and get him help. But he just wouldn't. So we just had to let go. It was tough. I've known him for almost 20 years. But we're all grown up and most of us have families of our own. And if they aren't willing to get the help you have to eventually just let go. 
519,"Seriously, his wife has made is clear she wants better boundaries between you and her husband, and here you are ready to smash through them with no consideration for what it could do to your ""best friend's"" marriage. You need to back waaay off. There is no logical reason for you to go through with this. It's only going to make it seem like you're trying to fuck with his relationship. The fact that you can't seem to see this makes me wonder if that's your goal."
520,"I hate this 'it's just how men are' shit. I'm a man and I know if a woman's granddad just died and she can't go to the funeral, it would be better to console her about that situation than lecture her on how she should have been smarter."
521,"I would say tell him that while you appreciate the thought behind him *wanting* to get you a good, quality gift, you feel like he's ignoring/dismissing your personality and values as an individual person, and that makes you feel like he doesn't care about *you* as an individual person. That the ""women like purses"" excuse makes you feel like he just sees you as a woman-shaped thing, and that worries you. See what he says."
522,"You need to make sure they know, 100% that you will not be taking him when they die. He's 16, and could presumably live a long time. They need to make arrangements. "
523,And if it has fetal alcohol syndrome?
524,"My mom and dad split when I was a baby and my dad decided that if he didn't have to pay custody he wouldn't even fight for visitation rights. I wanted desperately to meet him and my four sisters, I met him at 1 week prior to my 20th birthday. I'm 23 and I have been no-contact with him since I was about 21. Sometimes it's just not worth it and you're better than them. If you feel any pangs of regret you can always try in the future.

I know extremely well the mourning of the loss of a family you built in your mind. You deserved better birth parents who would at least meet you in real life. You are totally allowed to grieve the ""what could have beens."" It's very normal. But do remember your adopted family loves you very much and giving you to them was the best thing your birth parents have probably done their whole lives."
525,"OP, a couple of thoughts. I live in the US with my spouse. My MIL lives here, too, but is from a European country. I am of a different ethnicity.

My MIL was really antagonistic toward me as well. Her dislike more passive aggressive than your MIL's, who seems openly aggressive. I tried to remain respectful. I also tried very hard to walk the line between expecting my spouse to stick up for me while not unloading all my negative feelings on him and making him feel stuck between us. It was tough.

A couple of years into our marriage, she sent me a birthday card. In it was a heartfelt apology for how she had treated me. She acknowledged how she had behaved, and told me that she had come to realize that I am a good person and an excellent partner to her son. I was floored by her maturity and humility in addressing it. Frankly, I think most people would have just started acting nicer and pretended the earlier unpleasantness hadn't happened. I'll tell you, her stock really went up that day. She is now an excellent grandmother to my kids, and although we both have quirks that the other finds mildly annoying, we have a baseline of respect and affection for each other.

I hope that happens for you. If your wife chooses to to break contact, that seems healthy and reasonable. But I recommend you continue to take the high road as you have been, and just maybe things will get better over time.  Good luck!"
526,But we HAVE discussed gender roles. He identifies as a feminist. We've always operated as partners. I really don't see how I could have possibly predicted this kind of reaction. 
527,You need to outright confront him on this. If he never wants to move in together what's the point of staying with him?
528,Just listen to Krystal from now on.
529,Yeah... you sound 'dumb' because youre too afraid to talk to your boyfriend of two years.  Afraid he'll get mad.  Like... what kind of relationship is that?
530,"I think it's a combination of all the things you listed. I was in a relationship for over 4 years where we did nothing but spend time together (very unhealthy, why I left). I also have trust issues in general and I do worry about what he's doing. I do worry that he will have more fun without me and that he would prefer to be around other people than me. I think all the worry comes from being used to a relationship where our relationship was everything and noone else mattered. 

How did you manage to adjust to a ""normal"" relationship?"
531,"She wants to play the part. Take her out to a nice dinner and some activity later (like movie). Dress nicely, call it date, and be a gentleman. She just wants some courtship. Btw, You'll need to keep doing this on a semi regular basis to keep the relationship fresh. "
532,She took it purely for his peace of mind. There was no medical need for it AND she had to tolerate the side effects. 
533,I don't feel comfortable with abortion. But Id rather abort then have to deal with him. I guess I was hoping to keep it and find a way around it. 
534,"&gt; I wouldn't be shocked to see their marriage fall apart pretty quickly too.

Yup. Twenty-two, getting married after dating a little over year, and it's likely the bride is marrying a man/into a family that is willing to condone/reward cheating. The odds are not in their favor."
535,"I would actually ring him, put him on speaker phone with Joe being there and go ""g'day mate, so I've heard you want to ruin my life and just wondered if you're planning anything nasty or if you were just being a galah. Anything I need to know?"" "
536,"Firstly, lock your money down and get your pay to be directed to the bank you actually use.

Close unnecessary accounts that may be costing you fees.

Secondly, sit down with your boyfriend and **BUDGET** how you will pay him back over what time period.

What you can pay back to him each pay period is

PAY - living costs - small amount to savings - small amount of personal spending money for the week = amount left over to repay debts with.

The idea that none of your money is your own because you owe him a debt is a load of controlling bullshit, and you need to snap him out of that idea quick smart.

You need financial agency, and you need resources. You do NOT starve, or go without your morning coffee or whatever because you urgently have to repay boyfriend.

What is the urgency?

Is he your caring partner who helped out financially and displays love and patience? or is he a loan shark?

Coz he sounds a little loan sharky in your OP..."
537,"No I wouldn't mention what he said at all, just telling OP to know that even if he was mean or rude, it's not his fault at all."
538,You sound very immature and insensitive. I feel very sorry for the girl.
539,"Did John say anything when Lacey put her arms around him and kissed him? Did her pull her arms off of him or say ""hey that is not appropriate.""? "
540,"That is a great start!  Hopefully you will begin to meet people who are not so ridiculous about this and it will get better soon.  I think making your home a ""holiday"" attraction with lights and decor would also be a way of allowing the town to vicariously enjoy your home from the outside, too.  And make sure you have some really good candy for trick-or-treaters, too. It is not fair that you have to do things like this just to have peace, but it should help in nudging that door open.  (I once had a teaching job in a small-town but commuted, and it was a hard row to hoe trying to fit in.  You have my sympathies!)"
541,"There are a lot of red flags here beyond the accusation. If you didn't have the distance between you and you were together more often I'm guess there would be even more issues, he seems to have a bit of a control issue. The fact this is your first serious relationship doesn't help either. Leave him and lose the bullshit drama."

543,"I think you should get an opinion from a lawyer before talking to dad. You will probably get a lot farther with him coming from an angle of trying to help support him/child.

&gt;  55?M went through hell and back to just have visitation rights of my sister,

This doesn't sound like a man who is just going to let grandma or anyone else have primary custody. Tread carefully with this issue."
544,"Wasn't there a case a few years back in Canada where a fundie Muslim guy drowned three of his daughters in an honor killing for dating outside their religion? Edit: Yes there was, and wikipedia says there have been 12 cases of honor killings in Canada over the past decade.  Obviously non fundie types are way more prevalent in Canada, but don't act like it's a place where this never happens."
545,"THANK YOU! like goddamn, am I supposed to laugh every time my grandfather tells me the ""what's more dangerous than a n*gger driving a logging truck?"" Joke? Because they genuinely expect me to. It's so weird because I can tell there's literally no malicious intent, just blatant ignorance. And yes, it was always a compliment when family members would tell me I was so pretty ""because you have your moms features"". So glad to meet another honorary ""safe negro"". Lol"
546,She did not accept her daughter.
547,"There's a big difference between being ADHD and being a shithead. The OPs stepson is definitely a shit head who might not even have ADHD seeing as the grandparents/mother are spoiling them to such a degree that I wouldn't put it past them to doctor shop for a disorder when he was younger. If he was on medication in his childhood his rate of having ""outgrown"" it also increase substantially. The problem isn't his disorder, if he even still has it, it's completely on his family for not preparing him for life. "
548,Not to mention she sounds like a brat who uses her condition to get her way. Ugh.
549,"This. 
My father has an equation named after him and has won all the physics awards that exist and has never called himself smart or treated people like they are inferior to him. He in fact attributes his success partially to luck and looks down on people who think too highly of themselves.

Most people I work with already had PhDs by age 24. 

She probably is hiding a low self esteem and needs to work through that. 

You should talk to her because looking down on people is simply not nice. It's even worse when you have 0 merits."
550,"Then there's the whole thing about:  

&gt;I got frustrated and told her just take her pants off so I could get done and go to bed.  

Absolutely disgusting. And the part where he admits he drained the happiness from her life. And says he has big anger issues and is destructive. saying he doesn't trust her even though he has no reasons.  

She's falling asleep on the floor out of tiredness but he spends too much time gaming and looking at porn (including contacting people here on reddit, and comparing users photos with his wife, putting his wife's appearance down).   

No wonder she doesn't want to have sex with him. The part that worries me the most, is that he seems to care most about her 'putting out'. He doesn't seem to mind that she is deeply unhappy. So gross and selfish. Either way, it's a toxic relationship not fit for kids to be raised it. Sad :( "
551,"You have to leave him, for you and for the kids.

I was raised by a gaslighting parent and it badly badly affected my mental health for decades. "
552,"How the hell does having a mental illness mean you're at fault for everything? A mental illness isn't a curse - it just means you get treatment and remain mindful of your actions, which it sounds like you're doing. Your boyfriend is an asshole to use that as an excuse.

And my husband and I are a decade older, been together for 10 years, and while a lot of people would call our sex life meh, it works for us because our libidos match."
553,"Let her throw her fit, but don't give in. That is how one deals with toddlers, after all. You are in the right here, op. "
554,"There are some pretty cynical people here. There's no reason I can see for suspecting she's lying. You haven't indicated she's prone to lying or manipulation in the past. How careful were you two re protection?

Unless she starts demanding cash or something I think you have to give her the benefit of the doubt.

Assuming she's telling the truth, this can be a pretty terrifying experience for her. It doesn't seem like she's asking you for anything her, other than some emotional support. And I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to at least tell you, in fact, lots of people would argue she had a duty to tell you. 

What exactly is your concern? Are you scared that she's not really pregnant or that she is pregnant and won't go through with the abortion?"
555,"He says he's single, she's just helping keep him honest"
556,Sounds like you should just pull the trigger and get a dog
557,"I don't think it means OP is gay, but I'm curious about how he is able to be baffled by the gay when he was watching it?"
558,[deleted]
559,So the point of this was...
560,"I worked in a smaller team and we were all super close, and even we never spent $20! It was $5-10 and then sometimes pitch in a couple bucks towards a meal.

I think if you suggest taking them out to a restaurant and you all pitch in for the person's meal, then $5 each toward a gift card or flowers, way cheaper.  

They shouldn't be having caterers covered by employees! Wtf?!

I know how much it sucks when you're always the one dishing out money, especially when you're single.  However, when something worth celebrating or receiving attention/support for happens to you, you realize how special it feels.  I was always dishing out money and I really couldn't afford it... eventually, I had major health issues and my team was so good to me.  They got me nice cards and gifts... and they really went above and beyond for my last day (I recently got a new job)... it's pretty great. "
561,"You want her husband to beat him up, or...???? 

There's no way that would end well. It would be satisfying for about two minutes until her husband either gets his ass kicked or gets arrested or both. 

Your husband should 100% file a complaint, and I would encourage your coworkers to do so as well. HR didn't do as much as you'd hoped, but at least they did something. Without consistent reports and complaints, they won't know this is still a problem. Be a squeaky wheel. "
562,"Easiest way to lose weight is just diet. You can lose huge amounts of weight just by cutting out caloric drinks and reducing portion sizes. BUT he has to want to do it. If he isn't committed, no help you can give him will work. It's okay to leave over something like this, but you should have a big talk with him and let him know it's getting to that point."
563,You need to stop wearing them and indulging him.  He needs therapy.  This is pathological and you are only feeding into it
564,"&gt; I could leverage it by saying I won't be renewing my lease.

My guess is the landlord won't give a shit."
565,"""an offer is available if you have a want for it"" is not a hint, it's a proposition. I would dial back the contact with him unless you're good with helping him cheat on his wife."
566,"I see why he's a little resentful. He diagnosed his own problem at 13 and asked you for help to curb it. You prioritized the enjoyment of yourself and the two older kids at his expense. I see why you did that, but I also see why it upsets him.

I also see you doing things like saying, ""I'm not 10000% perfect,"" and accusing him of putting steroids in his food when it's probably just protein powder, and disapproving of weightlifting (for some reason?). That tendency to exaggerate and not support his new interests/pursuits is probably also driving him away.

I think you need to recognize you maybe could have done more to help him, and try to be a bit more supportive."
567,"Ok.. then I think you need to communicate better with your SO. You're being a bit passive aggressive about how upset this is making you. Talk to her. Tell her how this makes you feel. Ask her what the deal is with her mom. Communicate. If you can't express your feelings to her about something like this, how are you going to do it in the future when far more serious topics come up?"
568,"I hope you never experience what it's like to lose your child. If you do, I hope nobody ever says anything this ugly to you. "
569,"&gt;But it's obvious in that I'm not married, have no kids, and have a career.

Uhm. This isn't the mark of anyone from either side of the line. You are 22. Not being married and having kids is considered normal.

&gt;My neighbors hate me

I see no evidence of this. How are they hostile? 

&gt;For this town, someone my age would be married, with kids, have no career.

Hell, I'd be hostile to if I was subject to your broad generalizations based solely off the town I was born in. 

From what I see here and from your comments: You are judgmental and are projecting that because the residents small rural town didn't immediately want you as a best friend. 

Edit: You getting home after a 20 minute drive and finding a broken bottle of pasta sauce (twice!) does not mean anyone is out to get you. Dear God. Secure your damn groceries properly in your car and stop being a dramatic child. "
570,"Im fkn amazed by the responses of some of the posters here!!!  I would not even consider driving under the influence of a substance, I even carefully check prescribed medication to see if it has drowsy effects.

You may do it 10 times.  Or even 100 times and be fine.  But the one time you hit someone and hurt/kill them - its too fucking late to be whining ""well but it was fine every other time""."
571,I mean he's a FWB so his opinion doesn't matter. Maybe he shouldn't be acting like your dad/boyfriend? 
572,"To the dude who deleted his comment saying ""thats a lot of assumptions you're making"" here's my response to you - since I already wrote it out.

What I said above was not assumed.

A large portion of OP's testimony here, was in defense of WHY he went in the first place and him trying to explain that ""nothing bad happened"" so he shouldn't be in trouble. He wanted validation.

But, what's important is that:

&gt;She was not a fan of the idea but never said it was forbidden.

He knew she was not fond of this idea. 
_____________________

As for ASSUMPTIONS, these are the ones I would make:

My guess would be that he deliberately didn't bring the subject up after he realized that she wasn't fond of the idea and wasn't going to offer an approval. He probably knew that if he tried to bring the subject up again before it happened, that she WOULD'VE probably forbidden it. Meaning he'd have no excuse like ""well you didn't tell me I absolutely could not"" for going if he did. 

I assume that because he's insinuating that to be his saving grace.


By the way, when you're offering advice to strangers who're asking for it on the internet, IT'S OK TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS. 

OP can feel to correct me."
573,"&gt;The fact that he's managed for this long is a sign that he's a hero, not an imposter 

That's what I keep telling him. I also point out the fact that the owner of said company would have a heartattack if he threatened to leave. They'd be completely lost without him - and likely unable to function for very long. 

&gt; If nothing else, they can offer you some coping mechanisms that will help to prevent you from sliding into a surrogate counselor role for him. 

Yeah, I'm thinking this might have to be the option for the moment. It would definitely help me to talk it out with someone else. "
574,It's not about feeding him - just turn the tables. Let him give reasons - why he won't eat your lunch? Does he think your cooking skills not enough good? Do not accept any reasoning and turn absurd mode on until he understand something.
575,"Let's also add, even if a Narc goes to counseling and ""gets help,"" it's usually constructive advice used against you, and they're usually there for the show of it all. 

*edit for use of the wrong there and couldn't live with myself otherwise. "
576,"C'mon OP. You knew him for a few weeks. And both of you knew he was leaving soon, so there was no pressure of any consequences of cheating. You're in love with the idea of a relationship with him, not him. Actions speak louder than words. He can whisper sweet nothings in your ear all damn day, but ultimately he's still in CA with his fiancé, probably saying the same things to her as he does to you. And she gets to wake up next to him everyday. Get this delusion out of your head. Enjoy the high from those few weeks, and get back to reality"
577,"Don't bring a kid into this mess. He's an asshole, period. But both of your ideas above are *terrible*. 

What happens when your kid asks who his/her father is? Are you going to lie? That's not just morally abhorrent, but dangerous.

Either tell him about the pregnancy and work out a support/custody agreement or abort. "
578,Has she bothered to see a doctor? there are prescriptions available to help with libido......and it may be something worth looking into before opening up the marriage. 
579,"I second this.  The OP's mother is eerily familiar, if you get my drift."
580,Break up with him. He's only dating you as a stand in for her. Don't let yourself be someone's second choice.
581,'Listen to him and do what he says' wow okay no I'm glad you got out of there 
582,"I'm pissed off at your upbringing, your environment, your past relationships that have given you so little self esteem that you think that this is a guy you can be happy with. HE DOES NOT RESPECT YOU. or even like you? Why are you with him?"
583,"&gt; Start every conversation with, ""my boyfriend, whom I love so much, loves magic cards and video games and comic books and bla bla bla and we just love them so much TOGETHER!"".

That would work on the guys hitting on her but would annoy just about everyone else (in my opinion).  I'm probably taking this too literally though."
584,"Would you prefer to get in a stable relationship with someone you truly admire and would want to spend the rest of your life with or are you more interested in what women can provide? 

I can tell you so very truthfully that women are interested in men who are seeking to give in a relationship, not receive. I can assure you that a proper long-term relationship will give you SO much more than just personal gratification which is not what relationships are about at all. A relationship requires giving, something which you would of done with your previous girlfriend and got a slap in the face as it seems. 

I HIGHLY recommend that you try forge a long-term relationship with someone, rushing in to things isn't going to get you anywhere. Sorry if this isn't what you wanted but I believe deep down it is. :) "
585,Just break up with him. You already cheated. Staying together because the alternative is inconvenient is fucked up. Grow up.
586,That's a slippery slope. 
587,"Of course she can, that's not the point. The point is that if she goes to the state without naming him as the father (""father unknown"") then nothing will happen to OP. Considering how she has hidden everything from OP until now and that she has apparently made extra effort to hide everything it seems very unlikely that she would suddenly move to bring him into their lives. "
588,You're just fearmongering. Stop it.
589,"If I remember correctly it was for unpaid tuition and costumes (which she didn't even need because she came to us in April and their season ended in June) and for lost income since according to the old studio, she had told a bunch of people to quit and come to us. It's been almost two years and they still haven't shown up, so if they didn't come to us I guess they just got abducted by aliens and now the aliens are getting the money?

They had asked for a few grand, but settled for something like $800. She's doing much better with us, she's seeing the top dance physical therapist in our state and is easily becoming one of our best technicians."
590,"That's not an appropriate reaction at all. Why would it make him think less of someone for something they did when they were 14? Why should he assume OP's brother is at fault just because he's male? Why should the boyfriend be bothered by something that happened 10 years ago, doesn't affect him at all, is a funny family story, that doesn't bother the person actually affected by it? If I was OP and my boyfriend said something like this about a childhood fight with one of my siblings I'd think think they were out of line and really over dramatic. "
591,"You've been with this guy for three and a half years now - you know what he's like. Do you really want the rest of your life to look like this? Your significant other is your equal and your partner in life. Nobody, *especially* your partner, should ever treat you the way this guy does. Can you imagine ever treating somebody you love the way that he treats you? 

This guy isn't going to change unless he wants to, and he's proven over and over again that he does not give a shit about you and has no intention of working on his issues. You need to put your safety and happiness first and the first step is to get away from this guy. "
592,"I think it's being downvoted because OP talks about how they showered together and were getting into some foreplay on their wedding night, so he's already seen and touched her naked, and she's both seen and touched him while naked. 

While that doesn't discount body issues as a possible cause, the comment is probably garnering downvotes because the answer is in the post. "
593,"surely by making fun of someone's religion, you can get them to stop being in it!"
594,"&gt; I've never come across a brother-sister dynamic like you have just described. 

Only on Reddit. 

There was one about sis going on bro's honeymoon (one room), and one where bro+sis shared a bed for *months* (gf slept on the couch).

Gotta get me some links..."
595,"Are you overthinking this? I'd just post it up on Facebook.

If you don't want to steal their thunder just wait until after the party. But if they're your friends, wouldn't they be happy for you?"
596,So why did he magically stop coming home late?  Did he suddenly drop all those extra cases he took or what?
597,I find that approach passive aggressive. I would rather attempt to get unbiased information straight from the source. 
598,"OK text to send:

""Hey, I had a really great time hanging out with you. I know you're not looking for for a relationship, and that's cool. Let me know if you'd like to hang out again. If not, that's cool too.""

That's it. That's all. No follow-up texts. If she's gone, she's gone. 

It might be that **you** had an awesome time, but she really didn't. Or it might be that she just didn't connect with you. You can be nice, and make your intentions clear, but only once, and then you let it go. "
599,"The comments here are disgusting  and show just how miserable  some of the people who give ""advice""  here are sometimes. Your girlfriend  was assulted  by some creep and people consider it cheating. The fuck reddit?"
600,What plans did you make that you couldn't cancel? Did you even mention any of this to your boyfriend?
601,"Um... you  could just be single for a while if you don't have time to date.  I would recommend just going ""through the motions"" with some other girl.  You deserve better than what your current GF is giving you, but girl A also deserves more than you plan to give to her. It can  be good to be on your own and focus on yourself for awhile."
602,"&gt; ex who was needy, demanding, immature, etc.  

I wonder is he telling the truth.Maybe she just wanted some respect?   
 
&gt;he did say he was with her (before romance started between us) for the sex.  
  
I think you should leave for this alone. Tells what type of person he is. What if he is just with you for sex?  

&gt;Do I have a right to be upset  
yes"
603,"How can you even think you are in the wrong here?? Sounds like your self confidence is pretty low.. Were you this unsure of your own judgements before being with him? If this lack of self confidence has developed since being in the relationship, ask yourself why. Either way, work on developing your self belief.

He's being a piece of shit. Personally I wouldn't tolerate any bit of it, he's not someone I would want to spend my life with."

605,"This advice is great right here, but I'm laughing to myself because that is exactly how I trained my cat to not use his claws when we play together."
606,"Even without the deception, I think there's a limit to how genuine a connection can be with someone you've only met online. I've had great interactions on tinder only to find that the person is a completely different person in...person."
607,"You are uncomfortable with this, and that's ok, but you need to accept that this is your issue, and not that she did anything wrong.

If you are uncomfortable with it, break it off. You don't have to tell her that you are uncomfortable with her past. You are only casually dating. Tell her that you are ready to look for something else, more detached from work."
608,"&gt; She is exactly the same as EVERY OTHER KID! There is nothing special or unique about her

Wow. 

You claim to have a bond, but you don't see anything unique about a three year old who has her own skills and personality. 

You don't think your own child is special at all. 

That's fucked. "
609,They are 2 and 4. You are way overthinking this. She's not a bad mother and there isn't anything wrong with this behavior. 
610,"Get out now.  There is no excuse for violence.  None.  

Even if it's true that you should drop the subject once both of you understand that you disagree on something: *it's still not okay to get violent*.  Even if he prefaced it with ""If you don't stop doing X I'll hurt you"" and you do X some more, *it's still not okay to hurt you*.

Dump him because this will only get worse. Plus, you don't even seem to like each other very much.  There's nothing here to save. "
611,"Yeah, and what if she doesn't ""slowly and subtly"" influence him but instead just becomes beaten down? 

The purpose of dating is to find out whether you're compatible. She's not that compatible with him. She has no duty to take him on as an unpaid job."
612,"She's a big girl, no one made her do anything. I agree they seem like shitty people, but if she wants to hang out with shitty people and enable their shittiness, it's her choice. She's perfectly capable of hanging out with them without supporting their shitty behavior."
613,"If it's your own calculation, add 2 weeks. Length of pregnancy (clinically) is calculated from your last period.

All the more reason to get this sorted. Good luck."
614,"The single most important action you need to take for your own health and sanity is to distance yourself and go 'no-contact' with this girl immediately. Your relationship is long dead and you need to move on. Talk to your landlord. They often deal with situations like this and may be understanding about the lease and will help you out. 

&gt; Additionally, she has been unemployed for most of the year and I financially support us both.

Not anymore you don't. Grow a backbone. If girlfriend can break up, girlfriend can work.  "
615,"Sometimes being an adult means accepting that there are certain connections that can never be duplicated or shared because of what they involve. It doesn't sound as though this is something that OP is hiding from him, or something where she hasn't shared her grief. But the role of her ex as the father and someone who went through this with her is something that can never be replicated and he needs to respect that. "
616,^ this.
617,"Imo, it's even worse - the kids can't tell it's not normal. Because, after all, for them it absolutely is. So as adults they either simply show the same kind of behaviour or they register that normal and good are not always the same. In which case they have to actively ""unlearn"", which also sucks."
618,"You say your sex drive is higher but he's paying cam girls and asking for head, that doesn't jive. 

Your roommate being home isn't really an excuse for not having sex, I have a very high sex drive, I will find a way to make it happen, bed creaks? K let's try setting you up on the bathroom sink or on the floor or literally anywhere that's solid. You're loud? K bite my shoulder and squeeze me to keep from making noise, I can hold my hand over your mouth(not your nose, gotta breathe) put a ball gag in you mouth, etc.

Sometimes you need to do the ""say it out loud test"" instead of looking for a rational explanation, just say it straight up, out loud, to yourself.

""My husband has a low sex drive, pays cam girls and asks for head all the time""... 

Doesn't jive and it sounds like you are getting a sh*t deal here. First thing first, you do NOT need to put any more effort into fixing this, no matter how well you suck his dick you aren't ""fixing"" him, that's all on him and starts with a lot of recognition, ownership and effort on how end."

No shit. He was a 32 year old dating a teenager.

He wasn't looking for someone who took any effort. "
630,"This was also my experience. I no longer speak to anyone on that side of my family. A large part of cutting out my mother specifically is because while she swore she understood racism, she wouldn't defend me against other violently racist family members (literally violent, as in my uncle beat up my cousin's Black boyfriend to make him stay away from her) and continued pressuring me into being around them."

They are. I know about most of this because my partner complains about it. She annoys everyone in the family, which makes me feel bad, so I don't stop her when she goes on about this stuff. I'm wondering if she feels like I'm not safe to talk to about it anymore."

641,"Yep. I had that too. I did everything he suggested and still he'd reject me. This isn't about you, it's him. There's only so much you can talk about it before you need to decide whether you want this to be your life or not because it rarely changes."

I would tread lightly but this seems better than confronting it when you can't handle it any more.  Might consider erroring on the side of being her friend and letting her know you'll listen if the awkwardness doesn't break with a little bit of calling a spade a spade.

Even if X had a job at this VPN provider, any VPN provider worth their salt doesn't actually keep records of traffic through their servers because that gives the federal government a really good reason to subpoena them -- then they lose all of their business afterwards. The only reason he'd be able to access information about your bf's traffic is if the government HAD subpoenaed his company and was actively checking for traffic, and in which case they'd know exactly who was looking at these records (because it would potentially violate chain of custody if they didn't) and if he compromised an investigation he'd be out on his ass faster than you could say ""obstructing justice."" X is full of shit and just abusing what information you know of him to be convincing. 

With regard to your boyfriend, you should probably break up with him and go NC with him and X. They both sound scummy.

653,"Your feelings are justified, but people are... flawed.  Your father can be a really shitty husband and still love you and want to take care of you. That doesn't mean you have to forgive him and let him back into your life. But it does mean that as time goes by, if you change your mind and want to meer and be a part of his new family, that's OK too. You are allowed to love your father for being the awesome man who raised you and to hate him for hurting your mother and for betraying your family. "
654,"I 100% agree with you. He posted pictures, OF COURSE people believe him! The fact that people know he cheated on her actually gives MORE plausibility to his story. I mean, there are literally songs written about this kind of thing (I'm looking at you, Carrie Underwood). Well, maybe not about the stabbing part, but it's still more believable to think OP did it in a ""crime of passion"" than thinking he did it all to himself. That's next level crazy that most people never experience in real life and therefore have no reason to suspect. I think staying silent on this is a terrible idea, especially with coworkers involved. That shit will spread like wildfire in the office (if it hasn't already) and makes her look legitimately crazy. 

I'm sure if she texted him back and confronted him he'd admit to it immediately. Screenshot, post to Facebook, done. "

Besides, a laptop (although it depreciates quickly) is a tool that can be used to build future wealth -- bringing a positive return on the investment. It is a capital purchase. From your description, I gathered that his desired gifts are frivolous and/or quickly consumed. Food is eaten, shirts tear/stain/wear out quickly, games are completed. All of those are expenses that are expected to have near-zero value within 12 months while not building much wealth before they must be replaced.
 
Edit a word"
657,"Yeah, I agree on shaky communication. It sounds like if he sent a text saying he wanted to talk to her on a phone call she would oblige. Maybe he thought he shouldn't call because she might be busy, but all the had to do was text and ask for a time that would be good to talk. The expectations of communications go both ways.

I think the phone call thing isn't really the issue but the 7 guys. I'd be pretty offended if my boyfriend tried to suggest being around 7 guys would lead to something. He seems really insecure and a little needy. Maybe that's harsh, but my perspective is that i haven't lived in the same state as my boyfriend for over 3 years now, I accept that at certain times if he's on a trip or busy communication might be less involved. It's one week a year where they aren't together... "
658,"As the bride though, she could veto the ex's recent +1 by saying we didn't plan for it. She instead went to OP and took her spot and gave it to the date.

661,"I grew up with an alcoholic father, and I just want to give you a hug.

No, this isn't okay.  You're not overreacting.  My father and I had a close relationship when he wasn't drinking, and I was able to tell him how frightening he was when drunk and he heard me out.  

It kinda sounds like your father is almost never *not* drunk when he's home, so this is a lot more serious.  I'm skeptical of his ability to hear you out.

But your brother might be able to help--it *sounds* like he's siding with your dad to avoid being targeted himself.  Maybe your mom, too.  She has been a victim of his aggression before, and is likely afraid to act alone; I'd bet your brother has too and is acting in defense.  From your comments in response to other posts it sounds like your mom understands what kind of person he has become.

If the family can confront him *together* there may be some chance of causing a change, because it's clear that he's become a tyrant who you genuinely fear.  "
662,"I married my husband but I'm regretting it and always fantasizing about divorce for the past three months into our 1.75 years marriage because of his lack of commitment to equal housework. We both work full time, granted he works 5 hours more because of OT, but he has longer weekends than I do. We had countless arguments over chores because after a year and a bit of doing the chores all by myself, it was getting tiresome and off putting to see that he was a lazy fuck. He groans and moans when I BEG him to do this or that. He makes me into a nag because I have to ask him repeatedly to do something that he was suppose to do. It was also his idea for me to just tell him what to do because he simply ""forgets.""

If I could go back in time, I wouldn't have signed the papers. I'm stressed as fuck, unhappy as hell, aged a lot as though I was raising a hellbent defiant man child. Honestly, I feel completely taken for granted. 

I love him but this attribute about him is such a deal breaker that disrespects the meaning of unconditional love where I am falling out of love with him. And yes I've told him all of this. He does help sporadically but not consistently. Falls back to his lazy self until we argue at the top of our lungs until shit gets done. 

Honestly, just leave. People do not just simply change. It's in some people's nature to be lazy as fuck.  There is no loyalty anymore when there's such blatant disrespect and disregard to your partner in life. "
663,"&gt;But now I don't know what to do. I feel like our parents have a right to a lot of this information so that they can work on mending their relationship with Katie.

664,"No, of course you don't say that in that way, but if you can show that there is a pervasive systemic inequality along gender lines, that is absolutely a situation where you should engage in comparison -- I guess not specifically comparing yourself but comparing salaries of men and women. 

""I'm female, 23, and getting paid more than some people on my team who've been with the company longer than I have. It's very much based on your negotiation skills and tactics.""

Good for you.  I mean that sincerely.  However, your experience does not mean that there aren't companies where women are dramatically and consistently underpaid and that we don't live in a society where women don't get equal pay for equal work.  So no, ""it"" is not always based just on your negotiation skills and tactics (which themselves are subject to gendered thinking). "

"
668,"So what else is she intending on giving up on now you are married? This is just bizarre. What was her game plan? Next thing you know you will have some fat old sow sitting on your couch bitching you out about pretty much everything. 

I'm a chick and I can't even begin to imagine how you could do this to your husband. If anything all my married friends put effort into their appearances. Nothing over board but they always look well put together and a big part of it it being the woman their husband wanted to marry and not changing their standards. The guys do the same. Ok they are all attractive and take pride in themselves but they aren't vain or putting on a front. They all have young kids so there really isn't any excuse. 

If I was you I would be sitting down and have a frank discussion as to why she feels it is acceptable to change like this. If it genuinely is her outlook that she doesn't have to do it anymore then you have some bigger issues on your hands. Do not get her pregnant or you are in for a world of hurt you could never have imagined. 

She doesn't have to be trotting around looking like Heidi Klum (who is a very nice person) but she has misrepresented herself and needs a dose of reality. "
669,"Agreed.... they joke around like that ""all the time"" but suddenly she really is a racist and so is her family? Either this stuff has been bubbling below the surface for him or he's just really embarrassed and taking it out on her. "
670,"In that case, dump him. The problem isn't that he's inept at sex, it's that he doesn't give a shit about getting any better so long as his needs are being met.

671,"Did you or Mike get any therapy for the trauma you both went through? Usually, in the US, there is a advocate assigned to you that can help you negotiate the process. Also, I think its pretty obvious that you cant be the one to help Mike. I dont know if you would feel this way if you talked to him in person or not, but perhaps your husband can become more of the support to Mike if hes up to it. If not, let him know the truth, that through no fault of his own that texting you and all triggers the trauma response. Maybe use old fashion writing to see if it helps Mike and have your Husband respond. Im so sorry you have been through all of this, OP. It sucks. "

Okay then. I'll see you in ten years when your best years are behind you.

That is 100% not your responsibility. She is holding you emotionally hostage by threatening suicide. Do you realize how wrong that is?

If she *ever* threatens suicide, you call 911 and you walk away. That is it.

Another commenter, a new mother, wrote a heartfelt comment there, and she closed with some excellent advice:


*You both need to find intimacy in teamwork because the old ways don't work so well anymore. You know those delighted grins you exchange when baby learns a new trick? That's the kind of intimacy you learn to use as your foundation when you're a new parent - the romantic stuff has to wait until you have time, energy and hands free!*


*Be kind to each other.*

692,"After reading the title: ""He's not your best friend.""

After reading the whole post: ""Why the *fuck* are you even associating with this person?""

First, I totally understand why you're holding on to this ""friendship"". You have similar hobbies and were both in the military and I imagine it makes you feel more like you aren't alone in your experiences. But, he's not your friend. He could be taking out his frustrations on you or maybe he's just an asshole, doesn't matter. You're already going through a difficult period in your life and he's only making it worse. You're worth more than this and you don't have to put up with this kind of abuse.

Are you involved in any support groups for people returning to civilian life after the military? And are you in therapy? If not, you should be. I understand that it can be incredibly difficult getting appointments and care at most VA hospitals, but support groups and group therapy are usually much easier to get into. That would be a great opportunity for you to meet people in a very similar position to yours and give you a chance to talk out loud about what you're experiencing and feel validated, as well as receive help coping with any anxiety or PTSD you may have. I guarantee you'll meet others who feel the same way you do, and it's quite possible you'll meet someone your age who's also starting at a university- maybe even someone who goes to the same school you do! Do a google search for support groups/group therapy in your area (it's important to try both of those phrases as more options may turn up) and also contact your local VA and see what resources they offer. 

It doesn't matter why he's doing this, there is no rational explanation. Whether he's hurting emotionally and just projecting his insecurities on you or just a straight-up jerk, **you do not deserve this and he is wrong.** You are worth so much more and you will find people who will lift you up rather than push you down.

I'm not sure how long you've been dating, but it's up to you two to decide whether it's worth it.

Make sure your wife thinks she will be specifically turned on seeing you do the other lady.  I'd personally be icked by the age difference, not threatened but it would be a turnoff.

Talk (all 3 of you) about the dynamic you are going for.  What does your guest hope for from the encounter?

Not much advice I guess but I can assure you that occasional consensual outside play is compatible with a long term loving partnership, we do this (mostly in the other direction) and it's always brought us closer.  Good luck, have fun."

Too many times people use this (either purposefully or subconsciously) to try to steer the dynamic in their favour."

She keeps threatening you because she's an emotional mess and because it works. 

You can just tell her, if you keep threatening me with divorce then that's fine by me, you can have it. I can't be with a woman that I can't talk to like an adult when we disagree about something.

So yeah, separation and couples counselling sounds like a good start  . See how far you can get with her from that and if you guys can learn to communicate with each other in the way your partner needs, within reason. 

I can tell you from my own experience having someone be quick to threaten you when disagreeing is hurtful as fuck and eventually will start messing with your head and make you question your own reality at worst. like ""am I really doing something so bad that she needs to behave like this?"" etc.

I wish you the best of luck!"

711,I don't think you've done anything wrong here. You saw the message without snooping and were only reacting to things he said and did as he was saying and doing them. He lied multiple times and his reasons are suspect at best. He also is hiding stuff from you. How are you at fault here? 
712,"Wow. Even more red flags. It is incredibly messed up that he feels entitled to interrogate you about every instance of communication you have with another person. At this point, I bet he'll try to twist you having told him a white lie to get some time alone into a rationale for him being even more controlling and invasive. 

You can try changing your passcodes/words  and telling him he needs to back off and respect your boundaries. However, I doubt it'll work, especially over the long term. A person who acts like this five months into a relationship isn't going to shape up with just a firm conversation and a change to your phone passcode."

EDIT: further proof that it's not innocent from a comment by OP: 

&gt; She's snuck ham into turkey sandwiches, pork into chicken stir fry, made pasta sauce with pork sausage. Do you want more examples? She didn't tell me about the sandwich until after I had eaten it all and cheered because she ""knew i'd like it"". I could tell with the pasta because the sauce tasted different and she fessed up. The stir fry I only found out about because I noticed the chicken looked and smelled differently.

We traveled extensively and made many memories, but it happens when you least expect it. 

 So you knew about it and without over analyzing your situation, you have your own life and responsibilities.  You could not change his fate and your present circumstances prevent you from being there, it's okay.  So I say to you, don't beat yourself up over this, your family very likely knows where your heart is.  Send flowers, send cards, call and talk to loved ones.  Send pictures and special memories that you have.  Offer to help arrange music or something related.

After you've had some time to grieve, have a serious look at your relationship with your boyfriend.  Whether you realize it now or not, you've reached a crossroad in your relationship.

My heartfelt condolences on your loss.

724,"My husband and I changed our minds.  But we talked about what it would be like to have a kid and how we'd parent pretty much ad nauseam for a while before actually trying.  We found that we had very similar ideas on how best to raise a kid.

So now we have a son who is 3.5.  I am very happy about our choice.  This kid is a-maz-ing.  He's sweet, funny, clever, smart, sensitive, and beautiful.  The love I feel for him is overwhelming. 

My husband loves our son and is honestly an amazing father.  In fact, he's a SAHD right now. But he has said that, while he loves our son and doesn't regret him, if he had it to do all over again he probably wouldn't have a kid.  And that was after talking about having one and him wanting one for a long time.  This was surprising to me because I'm not a big ""kid person"" but little kids *love* him and he's so, so good with them (including with his nieces!)

There are a lot of pros and cons, which I'm sure other people will tell you about.  (Or feel free to ask.)  It's totally normal to change your mind  (and it's normal not to). But before making a sure decision, talk about it--at length--with your boyfriend.  Because once you have the kid, that's it.  You're a parent now. Forever.  Every day. For the fun and exceptionally rewarding stuff and for the tantrums and shitty diapers.  

Whatever you choose is fine, but you're going to need to have a lot of conversations before you really choose."

I thought of this too. That drama queen Beth was absolutely malicious and tried to take OP down thoroughly. And there's no doubt that it would be a horrible experience. 

But then it turns into a 'he said, she said' situation where no one wins, and all third parties are at risk of being dragged into the drama if they pick a side. 

By picking no sides, the neutral folk did not stop the drama (and likely the rumours). **But**, they also *(theoretically)* didn't fan the flames of the situation, they didn't say they believed Beth over OP and they didn't encourage the nastiness. "

Requiring someone to have no female friends, snooping their communications, monitoring their whereabouts... these are not things that can occur in a healthy relationship.   If you dont trust him without these things (and it sounds like you dont trust him even WITH them), your relationship needs to end.

730,"Let's not discount the cultural gender norms at play here. 

Correct me if I'm wrong,  but Asian cultures tend to have extremely strong gender norms.  This would include you being expected to provide for her,  and I've heard some crazy stories where they can get pretty mean and nasty when you,  as some one who is not of that culture,  fail to meet the expectations they are taught about their gender norms.

If I meet up right away, the whole thing seems like a job interview and I can't feel my feelings. I come away having made a good impression on them but with no feelings of interest or attraction for them. 

Men seem to want to jump straight to meeting to see if we have physical chemistry, and I get that, but it just doesn't work for me. I want to know whether we have things to talk about and make each other laugh. If not, I don't want to date them.

* You're saying you're a failure when you haven't even started trying for kids.  LIE.
* You're saying that you can't change course at 28.  LIE.
* Raising a kid in your 50's is THE WORST.  HUGE LIE.

Do you know what depression and anxiety are?  They're your brain (you) lying to yourself about the world.  ""You aren't good enough, you aren't capable, your creative spirit is crushed, you aren't ever going to make your goals""...all of those are lies.

I suggest you continue treatment/therapy or start if you haven't.  Then, make a list of careers that your degree can springboard.  Graphic design, interior design, user interface/experience, architecture, etc.  Then look at their requirements objectively and see if you *could* meet them.  Then write a 5-year plan.

740,"Her reasoning would be one of those moments where you suddenly see someone you thought you knew in a completely new light, and not in a flattering way.

Her family does not get to be priority just because they are all biologically related. And I would be honest and say that this makes you worry about the future. Does her family get to call the shots about holidays and grandchildren? If there are conflicts in family gatherings, does she expect you to default to her family? That will only cause resentment between the two of you because you don't strike me as someone who would want to reject your family.

She's not giving you a ""real"" family. A marriage joins TWO families. All she is doing is increasing the likelihood that she offends her in-laws and risking her chance of being a part of theirs. You need to have a further conversation and communicate. Don't be afraid to bring it to a counselor or therapist."

Is this really what you want the rest of your life? Because frankly, you two are still high on love hormones and she's on her best right now. This behaviour will only get worse.. a lot worse..

The being high on love hormones is also the reason why you don't move in with each other in the first months..  you wouldn't make big live choices when black out drunk or high on drugs, so don't do it when you're high on love hormones either."
744,"I don't think she needs to take her boyfriend's feelings into consideration.
I think other *redditers* need to understand the boyfriend's POV.  I suspect that is what /u/epichuntarz is saying. I don't think that this is a *character* flaw (that is something that is pretty difficult to change!). I think this is a *behavioral/emotional* flaw. I think the boyfriend needs to work on understanding grief; especially parental grief. I think OP needs to go back to her boyfriend and have a talk in which she lays out her feelings and lays out a lot of what /u/Outoffixins314 said. I think boyfriend has some hard life lessons, introspection and learning ahead. If he isn't willing to do that then OP should question if this relationship will survive. In *addition*, I think that others are right when they say that OP needs to think about how she wants this situation to be handled with any future S/O. Unless they have also lost someone very close (maybe unless they have experienced the loss of a child?) they are not going to fully understand what is going on.

749,"I personally think ending it is a good choice. 

However, it would absolutely take some resolve. If you explain to her that reason, she will beg and plead that she will be better. She will point out how she hasn't actually cheated.

While you have the option of clearly specifying your boundaries, *she should know*. She should have a sense of what is appropriate. If she's willing to touch a guy's chest right in front of you, she fails at boundaries. I don't see how you can trust her when you're *not* around."

There is no way to make him stop being cruel to you. You're afraid of him. You're only with him because you don't want to be alone. All of these things, you've said yourself. 

It's incredibly frustrating that you'll acknowledge all of that, but won't break up with him. We can't tell you anything else but leave him, because *that's all you can do to make it stop.*

Yet when people tell you you have to do that, you just keep making excuses for why you can't, like you just can't help it. Like there's nothing to be done about it and poor you for being locked into the situation. It's frustrating. Hence the downvotes.

If you're afraid to break up with him because you think he'll hit you like an ex did or something, do it over the phone or over text. Or if you insist on doing so on purpose, bring someone with you for safety.

But if you're going to put up with your boyfriend's cruelty just because you need a boyfriend, then please stop posting, because there's nothing we can do for you and you'll just piss everyone off because we're worried and you won't help yourself."
760,"Where were you when you were 21? It is perfectly normal now to live with your parents for a while until you can split rent with someone.

761,That's incorrect.  In many states of the US if you stay at someone's house for a month+ (varies by state) you gain tenant rights and have to be legally evicted ie served notice.   You don't need to pay rent or sign a lease to do so. /r/Legaladvice discusses this all the time.
762,"Hey Sarapmilk, it's difficult, but it's worth it. 

Let's start off with the basics here. Your little brother does have an interest in you and Jack. He just has no idea how to express it. You said you find the way he communicates weird. He finds the way everyone communicates weird. He's really trying to reach out beyond his comfort zone to connect with you. 

As someone with (mild) aspergers myself, the best way I can describe it is this. There are lots of lines on the ground. Social lines. The line that says ""don't joke about death in a hospital"", the line that says ""staring at someone too long is creepy"", the line that says ""don't dominate the conversation and only talk about what interests you"". Most people can see these lines instinctively. Folks with aspergers, well we can't. What we can do is look at where people are stepping around and avoiding, and by copying that behaviour over time we can get better at it. I'm 21, and unless you know me well I'm pretty much indistinguishable from a normal person. But that's with half a decade of putting in intensive effort into figuring out how social cues work, when I was 17 I was really totally useless at figuring out these things. Be patient, if he makes a faux pas or a bad joke or totally doesn't get your humour at all, don't worry. With time, it may come. Or it may not. But in order for it to come he needs to be able to interact with people and learn how regular people behave. If he's just in his room all the time there will be no improvement. 


Okay, on to the other stuff. How can you get along with your brother? If you're very lucky, one of whatever his present obsessions are (for me it's spaceflight, politics and history, for him one of them would be his video game probably) is something that interests you. If not, for the sake of a relationship with him try to learn about it. He'll be a massive store of information on that topic, possibly at an experts level. And he won't have any idea how to shut up about it either, most likely. 


But really, the easiest thing you can do? Just include him in things. Are you and Jack heading down to the park? Invite Benjamin along. He may not be very good company at first, but he'll get better, even if he's never as good at conversation as Jack is. It's a long hard road, but if you show him love, he will adore you forever. 


Oh, and good on you for reaching out and asking how to be a better sister to him. You're doing well :) "
763,"They aren't even good ideas to just toss into a normal, healthy relationship. Kink requires informed consent and tons of communication. You don't have a threesome willy-nilly because you lost an argument and need to apologize. And you certainly don't do it just to even the fuck score. That's highly dysfunctional.

She's trying to use promiscuity to relieve her own shame and guilt. If YOU have sex with other people, it's okay that SHE did it too."
764,"He's a lawyer making big bucks. Whether he wants to admit it or not, he's privileged. I look forward to the day that I can afford to hire someone to clean my house (I also look forward to the day I can afford a house). "

766,So much cringe. Don't sleep with her. You seriously need to re-evaluate how you interact with women. Both how you treat them and what you put up with from them.
767,"He and I have both gone to counseling alone. Part of what ""gets"" me is that he is very willing to go to a therapist, and says he talks over our issues at that office, but then is unable to discuss anything with me.

I would have been okay with small gifts, and actually suggested he gets something more reasonable but he didnt want to. "
772,"I think this is the best approach too.

Maybe OP could wear a very different wig to the one in the photos to kind of provoke a comment about her hair.  ""Oh wow your hair is so much longer than in the photos"" to which OP can reply about how it's a wig.  Or maybe do this on the second date, to make sure the won't be assumptions about  inaccurate (old) photos.  Plus it might be a bit abrupt to bring up any sort of ""serious issues "" on a first date - even if this isn't a deal breaker and I don't think it will be, certain topics seems too heavy for a first date....it almost feels like rushed intimacy which I personally am uncomfortable with.  "
773,"Well we can go with the optimistic assumption and assume that after she finds out and gets proof she breaks up with him. Then theres the pessimistic assumption that after she gets proof and confronts him he admits to it but he promises to never do it again and she stays. 

Either way someone is getting their heart broken and there will probably be fallout from this. "
774,"I have had reconstructive surgery on my ankle because I ""walked it off"". Look, you are in way over your head on this one. What you are experiencing is abuse.

**THIS** your contempt for her is palpable.  I'm so sad for your daughter. Right now,  I'm trapped on the couch because my 3 year old passed out while we were singing `old McDonald` I have a million things that need to be done.  Yet, I don't want to disturb her. I was getting a little teary thinking how few more times she will sleep on me. after thousands of times and hours,  probably less than a hundred in her whole life. And I took 2 pictures.

And unless they are fantastically wealthy, there's not going to be a way to hire someone to do his share of absolutely every chore for their entire marriage. For example, most people can't afford a full-time maid, a landscaper, a night nurse, and a nanny. And if he's not willing to do a lazy-ass easy thing like putting clothes in the dryer, what are the chances he'll be willing to mow a lawn, change diapers in the middle of the night, etc.?"
782,"Agreeing with this. I'm not a ""Katie"", in the sense of this particular dynamic, but I am the older child. My parents watched me like hawks. 

If I was too tired? I must be doing drugs. 
Too perky? I must be doing drugs. 
Too emotional/emotionless? I must be doing drugs. 

My mom searched through my shit all the time for years, and threatened me routinely with drug tests. I always told her to go ahead and try it, because I wasn't doing drugs, and would pass easily.

My sister, OTOH, did drugs and drank underage right under their noses and they never bothered to address it or discipline her, even when I specifically told them what she was up to because I was concerned. It was like they didn't care. That still pisses me off to this day."
783,"My wife and I have been married for 22 years.  Our only regrets are not cutting off our respective parents.  I did with mine for a number of years and things got somewhat better.  She never did and her mother messed with her until she died.  Took her forever to die as hell was not in any hurry to get one its minions back.

This is a deal killer, husband either needs to cut ties with his mother or you cut ties with him.  Don't give him an ultimatum, just tell him what you prefer.  If he doesn't back you up, counselling, then divorce.  Do it fast before this poxie MIL ruins your future."
784,"Also, if it ""somehow"" gets reported to your work, don't try to explain anything beyond the fact ~~your bf's family~~ someone is mistaken. You don't take drugs and you're willing to be drug tested is it's in doubt. "
785,"Thats the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

Communicate with your partner."
786,"That's still racism, and it makes him sound way too immature to be in a relationship.

It's your call, but dating someone with an ego that fragile sounds exhausting.

&gt; Honestly after the second time we were together he asked me if he did okay and was totally serious about it. The look in his eyes made me know that if I said anything short of ""great"" he would be crushed.

Wow.  That must make communication in the bedroom super fun."
787,Do not stay with her.  Now's your chance to get out.  You can't have a relationship without trust. 
788,"I came here to say something similar. 

 The people who feel the need to constantly talk about how much smarter they are than other people are, in my experience, the must insecure. The constant boasts are really validation seeking behavior.

I have a friend like this.  She might be slightly above average intelligence (maybe...), but every time I talk to her, she talks about how she's so much more clever than other people, how successful she is at her job, and how much money she makes. 

I went to her house a few times over the course of a couple weeks about a year ago after she'd broken her leg and became homebound and, each time, she was wearing dirty sweat pants, a sweat shirt . . and an enormous, gaudy, gemstone and diamond necklace (think prom style) and a huge gold and diamond rolex. I actually LOLed the first time I saw it and then refused to even acknowledge that she was wearing that stuff because I didn't want to indulge the obvious ploy to get me to comment on it. 

A few years ago, she went so far as to invent a medical school admission to Harvard (she never took the MCAT). Around the same time, I was talking to her via text when she was bragging about something and it became clear that she thought that the word ""doctorate"" was actually ""doctrine."" She explained she was working on some kind of ""doctrine"" in something.  lol. I just casually asked her what that was and told her my understanding of what a doctrine was. She definitely squirmed.

Anyway, I realized she mostly does this with me (an attorney) and another friend who is an accomplished nurse.  This behavior is definitely insecurity. 

Truly smart and accomplished people let their accomplishments speak for themselves and don't feel the need to talk themselves up. "

790,"I am just more so frustrated that we have been through this before, talked for days about it and I thought we got through to each other and had it figured out. And now today he does it again and then blames me for just always being miserable and pretends he never told me we could go with him and that I never asked. I honestly don't get it."
791,"Nope, not just you! Can confirm she's a major creeper, yeesh"
792,"It's definitely been defined that we're exclusive. But okay, that's a big relief. The way she reacted made me feel like my emotions were unjustified and basically inconsequential, so that was... not a great feeling. "
793,Wonder if she's single
794,"That would feel great to say in the moment. It would also immediately ~~create an even more hostile work environment.~~ escalate the situation, and make the workplace more fraught. "
795,"So, you've been together for three years and  you have a child together.  You would think he would be over it but this behavior suggests otherwise.  You're not being unreasonable.  This behavior is quite ridiculous and I'm annoyed on your behalf.  Perhaps, your husband doesn't understand how his behavior is not just annoying but also insulting and unhealthy.  Counseling seems like a good idea, individual and couples. "
796,"Well to be fair, even the nicest people start thinking ugly thoughts sometimes (say, while stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic for two hours). I don't really think it's about rewarding being two-faced, but more about the fact that there are thoughts that don't need to be shared with others."
797,That's not at all how actual polyamory works in any case...
798,"I agree - especially if OP's wife is going to be a SAHM, she is going to be the one dealing with the differences in social circles and culture more than OP will be. 

I also agree with the other comment that asked whether OP and his wife have really thought about what it means to live in NYC or Chicago - visiting the city is very different from trying to live and raise a family there.

OP, your wife has legitimate concerns about moving to the South, based on her cultural and social beliefs.  Personally, I would keep looking for other opportunities.  The last thing you want is to pick up your family and move to a new location and have your wife hate the place while trying to deal with a newborn."
799,"I'm not trying to coddle OP but six weeks of a very intense relationship followed by this severe of a ghost would have me losing sleep for a few nights, too.


and she had PLANS to come over...and she was acting like she still was up until MIDNIGHT.  like wtf?  that is absolutely not normal."
800,"If you don't block him and you let him guilt you, you are teaching him that his behavior is a good strategy. Like hey, this creepy desperate thing is working because sweatycat is still replying to me. "
801,I'm just surprised that people don't know this hahajajajaja those dudes can make hair appear/dissapear basically whatever they want
802,"Yeah, but you don't stick with a shitty friend, even if they're your only friend. "
803,"Everyone becomes a hypocrit over this topic.  If it were them, they'd want to know 100%, but if it wasnt them, ""the bro code,"" ""not my business,"" ""snitch,"" they've got a hundred billshut excuses why to avoid it.

Long story short, you did the right thing, guaranteed.  People who bad-talk your situation are just embarrassed at having not done it themselves, or not having the guts to see something ugly and confront it, preferring to hide like cowards behind some ""bro code.""  It is one of those situations where everyone wishes it never came up and it'll only get more awkward if you react to it, everyone knows they should or wants to make a move,  but most dont.  

I had the same thing happen with a co-worker.  Over a 6-10month period I heard all about his weekly sex romps with strangers, to the point of him openly picking up girls at a work christmas party, girlfriend's presents in toe.  After months of telling him I disapproved, wanted to hear none of it, and that he should tell her or break up, nothing changed.  A few weeks before my contract ended at the job he even put me into a conversation with her online, so it was personal now.  Not an hour after my last shift working together with him ended - keepin' things professional - I sent her an email with dates/proof that he has told and shown me.  His and every other guy's reaction was the same as your friends; disgusted and disapproving of me.  Its a group-mentality thing.  Easier to keep the group together and shun me/you instead of risking a divide in the pack as everyone struggles with right/wrong and shame over having approved of it."
804,Why has she came clean now then? What's the deal with that?
805,"When you marry, get a prenup."
806,"&gt; buying half of a drycleaner? why on earth would that be a good idea.

It's a great way for stepdad to get a huge check right now while also retaining control over the profits and accounting records.

""Oh, sorry, after my salary we only had a $500 profit this year.  Here's your $250."""
807,I think she mean't ordered to go there for holidays by a judge. If she doesn't go her father could be in trouble for breaking a custody order. 
808,It is time - he is at home so he is also able to do more.
809,"What happened between them is frankly none of your business it's between them. You probably shouldn't have brought it up to your mom because she's going to be the one to cause issue if she can't control her emotions. Your SM seems to be acting like the most mature person in this case. It sucks, but she's made her decision and you have to respect that. Plan your wedding and make it what you want it to be. If you need help rely on friends or even a planner if you can afford it. "
810, I get blending with office culture but I disagree. Lunch is off the clock and an employee's own personal time. You can't bully someone about how they use their time.
811,"&gt;I just want to start out by saying what you're about to read is fucked up. On my part and his......I've been with my husband for 10 years. We are high school sweethearts. We just got married 3 months ago. Through the years he's cheated on me multiple times.....I've forgiven him every single time.....which is probably why I'm here now.

OK, STOP, PAUSE. I need to take a break RIGHT here!

That's *exactly* why you are here now. What possessed you to put yourself in that position? 

The red flags couldn't have been flying any higher!!!

&gt;It's not something I've ever completely gotten over and I still don't 100% trust him.

So you've been married to a guy that you've never been able to say you've trusted?

&gt;I'm cringing as I type this.

Cringing as I read this.
______________

Okay so I'm going to quit critiquing your life choices now and get to giving you some advice.

1. I probably wouldn't tell him of what you heard or your tactics. Honestly it doesn't even matter what you heard, you don't trust him, and that warrants you to leave him. You can do that without acknowledging that you hardcore invaded his privacy. The fact of the matter is that it wasn't legal and if you want to protect yourself you don't say that, you seem to understand that, cool..so

2. You don't have kids and you don't own a house. You are in a position many in similar marital situations would kill to be able to say they are. Take advantage of that.

3. Pack your bags. Get. Your. Shit. Out.

4. Consult with a divorce attorney. You've only been legally married for 3 months. This shouldn't be too hard of a split.

Anyways, you're life isn't over OP. Don't settle for this. 

It's time to start living your life.

812,"There is no way to have this baby and NOT have this douchebag in your life. Legally and morally, your child will have the right to have a relationship with his father, which means you WILL have to deal with him for the next 18 years. 

Have the baby and deal with having him in your life, or abort and leave him behind forever. There is no third option."
813,"Aw, your Gram sounds like an awesome lady. So glad she's got your back here."
814,"My FIL posed for our wedding pictures with his hand on my ass. I don't think he would ever take it further than that and a few offhand comments on my looks, but gross. So awkward. "
815,"It's the sort of spending you see a lot in people who are bad with money - each purchase is reasonable on its own, but it adds up to overspending, and ultimately catastrophe if an emergency comes up. And it's hard to convince people to exercise self-control when they see so many other people normalizing the paycheck-to-paycheck life.

GF is young enough that she might be able to change, but it has to be something she buys into on her own. Feeling like OP is forcing her to change won't help anything in the long run. Unfortunately, this also means OP will have to decide what to do based on how she is now, instead of assuming she'll change in the future."
816,"I was only a few sentences in before I felt the need to link that, glad you got here first"
817,Why are you assuming the daughter didn't try hard? And why is the son struggling more just because he has loans? Usually a more prestigious university leads itself to higher earning potential. 
818,I think the reason they posted on this sub is that they want opinions from non-Christians.
819,"careful with that... don't guilt him.  you don't want somebody coming down begrudgingly.  They're dealing with stressors that have gone beyond their coping skills... adding more stress isn't helpful.

The world better or good is just an excuse or rationalization... the issue is they're having problems coping with their life for whatever the reason."
820,"Yeah, I'd love an update. Hope it works out for you!"
821,[removed]
822,"My fiancé grew up in a similar household. In fact we were at his parents' house a few months ago, right after I started my new job, and my fiancé said something about him havimg to help around the house more. His mother told me I was ""a quitter"" for not doing her adult son's laundry for him anymore."
823,"Chicks before dicks, Uteruses before Duderuses, Besties before testis

pick &amp; choose"
824,"Also the fact you're taking your brother's words your fiancee's family is a red flag *to her*. She's IS being open and honest about her family status on why she is hesitant on letting you meet extended family.  She might not even be that close to them, especially if she's pariah and can't fully gauge how they will react to you. 

It makes you seem just as myopic as your brother. Because **you are letting your brother set the tone for your marriage to your wife and her views on family**. You even seem like he could be right and it's make you hesitate. Wow. You need a serious trip to a counselor for her sake if you want a strong marriage going forth. Because you need to start setting boundaries with your brother. 

And you need to take your soon-to-be wife's word over his and her family being different *is not a red flag to your marriage*. Even her views towards them because not everyone in family is not nice. Look at your brother- he's proactively trying to stop your engagement because he doesn't know or fully understand HER situation... and are you going to make him privy to that? Does he honestly have that right? Does the fiancee want him to know? Or does her opinion not matter here because he's your brother?"
825,I appreciate your warmth. Thank you. 
826,I think advice from my SO (my age) could help too because he's very close with my brother and his friends. He's just as worried as I am. 
827,"Just a thought here . . . this thread is for the benefit of OP, yes?  Recommend you say your say -- OP should see it in her inbox if nothing else.  Doesn't matter if it gets downvotes, really.  That just means a number of people disagree."
828,"I don't think there's anything wrong with ""Friday is sex day"" and if you two aren't having sex as often as you'd like it might solve some issues.

I think part of the reason for the reaction you're getting is just the way you phrased things, like you're on the verge of making a colour coded sex timetable. Maybe your boyfriend would also react differently if you phrased things differently.

Also, if you're seeing a problem here and bf isn't, it might just be that you have a higher libido than him. That's not necessarily solvable, definitely not without you both acknowledging it together. You guys need an honest conversation more than you need a schedule."
829,I know a guy who does stuff like this. He finds ways to shove what he has and does in his ex's face. 
830,"Yep, I was about to mention this. It's very helpful with people who suffer from maladaptive coping mechanisms to know before hand if something involves, say, depictions of self-harm so they can stay away from it. A lot of psychologists will recommend staying away from know triggers like that. Not every day things people have to learn how to deal with, but special situations that can be easily avoided as to not fall back and relapse. 

But of course lots of people on both sides of the ""trigger"" argument don't at all understand this. "
831,They shouldn't happen period.  Illegal distribution of controlled substances is a felony.
832,I share OPs viewpoints. That's why I dated and married a man my own age who shared those values with me.
833,"Go and get your cat with a friend. Don't engage him. Keep kitty in your room until you move to not bother roommate. 

Then, block your abusive ass ex on everything. Threatening suicide is manipulative as hell, if not downright abusive. It's not your responsibility to get him healthy and sober. You're HALF his age and you've been able to get your life on a positive track. Have you talked to your therapist about this? I'm surprised they haven't expressed concern..."
