0,I love being friends with my cousins who are 20 years younger than me! This is a great way for OP to explain it.
1,"Did you read the post? They're both working every day- her at work and him parenting. But then she comes home and does another shift- BY HERSELF! She's working double shift every day, he's working one shift then putting his feet up and relaxing."
2,"&gt; manko

Or the name of a poet, also an not uncommon first name. Also the name of an lake, and a princess attached to the legend of that lake. "
3,"You're right about one thing, it doesn't make sense. Troll or side piece, take your pick, you're one or the other."
4,"Lassy there isn't actually anything wrong with sex, ya know. Your coworkers are arseholes. Indo understand the whole its not a good idea to shag on the job thing, but its one guy not all of them :p
 Have a lovely romantic/filthy weekend and enjoy yourself. Especially if he's that good at foreplay. 
And, for the record, I'm a fat nerdy women with similar self esteem issues. My ex still thiught I was beautiful, and showed me off to his friends. Men aren't nearly as fussy as women think they are. "
5,Mission accomplished. Clearly sounds like he's still a baby. 
6,"I think this is the way to go. Aggressive off the bat will only escalate, and, while his feelings are based on ridiculous insecurity, his feelings and fears are still real. 

Some genes are strong. My BIL has incredibly strong genes in his family--light skin and blue eyes. Their bio kids take after him. My sister's nieces are 1/4 Navajo, and they have *pale skin, blonde hair, and blue eyes*. Their father is darker with black hair, but yeah, their mother's genes were that strong. Certain families just have strong genes. 

Your husband knows that, but I am guessing he is feeling sore because of the social effects. Jokes about them not looking like him are probably not something he expected. I'd maybe ask him more about the comments and see how he feels you can support him. Get a dialog going about his feelings and how you can both get a reign on them. "
7,"Thank you. I am doing mostly okay, currently living with my parents, but since they are gone most of the time, I only see my father around late at night, and he's usually too tired to bother me nowadays. I'm looking for a full-time job (currently working PT) that will enable me to earn a liveable income to move out. 

However, a lot of the abuse I suffered throughout my younger life still affects me a lot. I'm learning to cope with it by opening up to people and seeing a psychologist / therapist. I'm still learning that I need to accept and love myself before seeking it from others. It's still hard a lot of the time, I was also diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum and hemiplegic migraines (due to my dad's genes), having anxiety disorder, etc.

I try to be strong for myself and others. Cruelty and constantly being told I'm ""worthless / a failure"" has shaped me in a way that I try to be kind, caring, open-minded, compassionate, and seeing the worth and value in other people and life. I can't stand being or seeing other people in pain. I see the struggles others like me go through, and it hurts. It cuts you deep in a way you can't even imagine.

In some ways, even though I know I could never prove my parents' views wrong, I've achieved some amazing feats, given my disabilities. I've gotten recognition from notable and well-respected sources. I've earned the respect of others through striving to impress, and the admiration of others. 

That's all I can really ask for: acknowledgement of my worthiness as a human being."
8,"You have to walk before you can run. Ignoring the autism, everyone would still advise you to start building up a social group and work on social skills in general before worrying about dating.

Have you talked to your psychiatrist about some sort of cognitive behavioral therapy or social skills training?"
9,"Soooo, your options were a woman who obviously has the whole parenting thing down, loves children, is mentally stable, has a long term relationship with someone who isn't going to die of old age in a couple of years, and who has expressed interest in becoming the guardian of your child...

or someone either with mental problems or who is a gold digger, is frequently traveling, is extremely young and in a short relationship with her grandfather. 

You chose wrong, OP. No wonder shes upset. "
10,"Why hide women's garments from a boy? Tell him what they are, what they're for and move on. Keeping things like that a secret from boys will make him a weird man. Ex's mom was like this and he'd freak out at the site of clean panties and call them gross... current bf was raised with women who gave zero fucks and I can forget my undies while taking a shower and ask him for some and instead of a meltdown, he asks thong, briefs or hipsters lol."
11,"&gt; She doesn't care if we got loud or obnoxious

You should be more considerate of your neighbors."
12,"It definitely can ruin sex drive to this extent. Not only does it cause erectile dysfunction, but porn addicts also eventually become desensitized to even the porn they started off with and search for progressively more extreme videos, not to mention lose interest in real sex. Depression is 2x as common in porn addicts, as well as heightened chance of infidelity, etc. It fucks up your mind more than one would assume."
13,Touken ranbu has been so popular for quite a while now and has a lot of merch so my honest guess is one of them sword boys. 
14,I suspect that he cannot deal with me having any boundaries and being told no. I think it was just a suggestion to start with but when I said no he became obsessed with the idea because he doesn't like being told he can't do something. 
15,"well, damn i mean obviously. he's the cheater and u guys are the kids. she was the person who was primarily damaged and traumatized by the situation. i think u are being s little insensitive about ur mom ""not handling things"". "
16,"Well, when you guys do fuck, its probably not going to be very good. Dont ridicule him if it only lasts 2-3 minutes. Instead, establish open and honest communication so you guys can get in tune with eachothers needs once you hit that milestone.

Let him know when you are dtf, but let him choose when it happens after that. 

Finally, dude might have a lot of anxiety over being 29 and a virgin. Sometimes anxiety makes guys not perform well, or at all. Again dont ridicule, keep that open communication going and dont make him feel even more pressured.

"
17,"That is not a healthy weight. Your boyfriend has an extremely warped view of how women's bodies work. That is disgusting. This would be an absolute dealbreaker for me. I am 5'3 and 130 pounds. I've got a bit of a booty, but I'm by no means fat. I had a friend from high school, who watches **way** too much anime and hentai, and into those japanese porn games like Honeypop. And so he thinks all women should be little sticks like the ones he's consuming. He called me fat, not once, not twice, but three times. And I would call him out, and he would never properly apologize. I started noticing it was other behavior as well, anytime I was talking highly of myself, or being excited about an opportunity, he would immediately disparage himself, so the conversation turned to cheering him up. I dumped the friend, and my life has been so much better without someone trying to put me down so they can feel better all the time. "
18,"&gt; to not feel like I didn't try to save my marriage

What exactly is *he* doing to save the marriage? Ok, then. You don't have to try, and you don't have to feel bad about not trying."
19,Be straight with him... by lying?
20,"Any reason is a legitimate reason to end a relationship. It takes two to start a relationship, only one to leave.

However, have you discussed things with her? Have you tried initiating? If so have you tried putting a little effort into it occasionally i.e. romance?"
21,He bought her things she expressed interest in or said she wanted. He never bought her anything she said she didn't want.
22,"this absolutely. don't say you went through their phone, don't say you think you know what's going on, just emphasize your support and love for them, and give them space to open up about it on their terms. 

being closeted is very weird, and different for everyone, so they could be acting this way because they have no clue how you will respond (even if you think it should be obvious). i'm not saying this should excuse their behavior, but might be a reason for it. 
"
23,This isn't the kind of thing that you make a case out of. Acknowledging it in any way will make it worse. 
24,Yeah if she's not fucking Andy she's using him and playing him because she knows he wants to fuck her. 
25,[deleted]
26,"you're on tghe right path, go with grey rock as best you can and encourage your mom to do the same.

you might want to ask /r/legaladvice about the house, and perhaps look for low cost legal clinics in your area. your mom probably has more rights and resources than she thinks."
27,"&gt; Just divorce him.

This OP. Having to keep tabs on someone that you don't trust is exhausting. I don't know if children are involved or if there is some other reason why you are trying to hold on to this, but I feel like divorcing him is going to be a big relief."
28,"Did you read the post? She tried to remove herself from the situation by going to sleep because she knew she was moody. She didn't even want to argue, he kept goading her. They share a room, there wasn't much else she could've done to remove herself."
29,"Not allowed to link in this subreddit, but you might want to look up the blog No Longer Quivering. (Sorry if you already have, not trying to assume!) You're in a rough position but you are not alone! "
30,"Are post sex photos a thing now? Because that's beyond trashy and classless. If I saw something like that posted, I'd be mortally embarrassed for the entire family of everyone involved. "
31,"She didn't give a clear response because she doesn't want to go out with you

As to why she didn't specifically say ""no"", I would assume it's because she didn't want that awkward conversation

I wouldn't ask her out again"
32,"Life's too short for bullshit like that, thinking, wondering, analysing. He obviously likes you, so just fucking enjoy it. Whatever happens next, you're gonna worry about it later. Honestly, you don't need to have deep conversations about the future. Neither of you knows each other that well in real life, as in when living together - having even one week where you are sharing the house will open your eyes as to whether you actually like him or not that much. And he will learn the same about you. Just give yourselves a chance, go and have fun. And as to what other people think - who gives a fuck? You certainly shouldn't. It's your life and you're as entitled to happiness as other people."
33,Cut and run is the name of the game. The only thing that has that address is mail from my mom thats in my apartment. So I'm certain she was snooping around my place when she was here.
34,Upvoting because that's a great idea! 
35,"I think you might be right about the guilt but she does genuinely believe that a life without children is empty and that if I don't have kids I will regret it massively down the line. I will keep the guilt thing in mind though, thanks."
36,Kind of hard when one parent won't talk to you. 
37,"10 hours is still within the normal range, which most professionals say is 7-10 hours.  I need 9 to 9.5 a night or I'm not functioning at full capacity."
38,Theres tons of healthy relationships where people don't do this??? Maybe you should look for one.
39,"You told him what you need from him. You laid out the consequences of his (in)actions. Now you just have to follow through. Until he comments on the last one, he doesn't get another one. Simple. "
40,"I think what also hurt was that she warned you, told you how uncomfortable she was with you talking to her, and completely disregarded her feelings and you still ended cheating on her. So in essence, you wanted to cheat on her or at least didn't care that it was going this direction. Good luck earning her trust because you threw that away for something that meant nothing. "
41,"But that doesn't sound like a healthy environment for such young children...she should pursue joint custody if he cleans up his act and starts actually being a parent, otherwise there's no reason to punish the kids by making them live in filth. "
42,"I know! Everyone seems so eager to whitewash the dad and make him out to have been faultless and put 100% of all blame on the stepmother. But I noticed OP said 

&gt; I never pictured my father as being racist to this level. 

which makes me think that he was racist and she knew it, she just thought it was confined to the occasional racist remark and wasn't hurting anyone. 

It's easy for me to believe someone rejected a kid because he was half Asian. My father told me that if I didn't break up with my first serious boyfriend, who was half Filipino (only half!), I would be no daughter of his and he would completely disown me. "
43,"That's not OP: ""Because *they* just have a family dynamic *like mine* where my mom is always begging me to use my position in the family to control others."""
44,"I don't think you're jumping the gun about telling her you're concerned about her actions. 

But you need to make it clear to her that her being the third wheel is not an option."
45,"You told your conservative, immigrant parents that your fiancee is a burlesque dancer? Why? What exactly did you expect would happen. Burlesque dancing is something that is certainly an acquired taste and there are many people who would have the same reaction as your parents. I honestly think it was pretty irrisponsable for you to tell them that. It's not something they would need to know."
46,"Or maybe it's just that she can't read his mind to know that he wanted her to support him. It's a friend he said he doesn't really see anymore, and he never actually told her that he did want her there. You can't say she has no empathy when you don't know her."
47,"Second this. I am dreading a similar problem when I have our firstborn. My mother recently took it upon herself to plan out mine and DHs TTC timeline, and her involvement. I am certain she assumes she will be in the room, and at very least, waiting anxiously in the wings.

I've already decided to take the simple, clear route: ""DH and I want to have this experience of our first childbirth with only one another. You will be contacted, along with other immediate family, when we are ready for visitors. We ask that no one wait in the hospital during labor."" (My parents live in town anyway, and his parents are only 2 hours way).

You are a married adult, and you are not responsible for your mothers feelings. This has taken me a long time to realize, and I am still working on being upfront with her. You are not being unkind, nor unreasonable: how she reacts is her problem, not yours.

Good luck!"
48,"You have a right to not share your entire browser history with your girlfriend. I think this situation reveals some deeper trust issues on both sides. Your girlfriend felt the need to look through your browser history and doubted your honest response. You felt very embarrassed about normal medical problems that aren't anything to be ashamed of. Communication is the name of the game. Talking will usually either solve a problem, or reveal larger issues. "
49,"I don't know if it's an idea but my husband and I each got something meaningful for each other for the wedding day (we saw each other before we got married to take photos as I wanted that to be more of a private affair) and I got him a pocket watch (something that he could hang on to for years to come) and he got me a pair of shoes that I've wanted that he had to really track down because they were discontinued and it took a lot of time and effort to get them. If a car payment is what he wants and you've asked (I've learned never to ask such an open question as I know my husband would tell me not to bother spending any money on him but he is grateful for things I do purchase him),I would suggest  just making the car payment for him as suggested above and then maybe getting him something for the wedding day (even if you don't see him, a groomsman can pass the gift along to him on the big day) that is more a trinket for sentimental reasons. "
50,"What discrimination? Any business can refuse service asking as it's not based on age, race, or sex. She's getting banned for being a drama causing asshole. And loitering? Does she by anything. Frankly you don't even need a reason to ban her as long as it's not based on one of the mentioned protected classes."
51,"Hi guys, a little bit of update. She told her supervisor at work and they called the cops. She's going to tell them but not press charges. Her supervisor is giving her time off and she will be coming to me for the time being.

We will act from there on. Thank you for all your support. I will update."
52,Right? I want to carry this commenter around in my pocket so they can talk me through my whole day.
53,"If you have a problem with someone, then you got to that person first to discuss it with them. Not family, not friends - that specific person. That's what effective communication is. "
54,"Or... Make my sammich dry, I like to do the toppings myself. Honestly, I'm a good cook (based on others opinions), but my husband has particular ideas about condiments, sweetening, pepper, etc. After eight years(!) I'm clued in but about a year in he was just like... Stop. You do it wrong. Let me. I was offended for a second, but I got to watch him do his own thing with those variables and declare my cooking amazing. Then I watched, and watched, and watched... And one day, I got the whole shebang right. "
55,"I agree.  This is not normal behavior.  This needs to be taken very seriously.  I would see H.R. first and alone.

H.R. will be well aware if this has occurred with someone else at the company."
56,"How about the car, please tell me its in your name?   Take what's yours.  Also call the police to monitor the situation as he has punched you in the eye.  You are better off without him.

Very happy about your sobriety."
57,"You should not.

Telling your ex this is just offering him an opportunity to bully and manipulate you again. He's good at that. No reason to provide him with ammunition. No reason to believe any contact will be a positive experience for you.

Let go of the childish impulse to 'prove' something to your abusive ex."
58,"But why though? They've known me for years, I've done everything for them and we've been through thick and thin together. They've only known him for 4 months. How can it even be a question?"
59,OP also writes that they were together before getting the dog but doesn't state how long they've been together though OP mentions . Because of this I would assume that the anxiety has become worse and her therapist and/or medication is not helping. I'd recommend seeing a new therapist.

62,"This is utterly cruel, and a little fucking evil. This is your brother's funeral. You should be there. This is 100% a dealbreaker. Your boyfriend has no compassion or humanity and doesn't care about your feelings. "
63,"I would be livid, too. I'd probably rage-cry, and I hate rage-crying, it pisses me off even more. BUT.. since you dont believe they were being malicious, maybe you can cut them some slack *just this one time* . But I would absolutely tell them that they can never fuck around in your office ever again. 

Maybe they just got super excited about cleaning your office since they've never gotten to do it before. Maybe they thought they were doing you a wondrous solid by making your office all nice and neat. That sounds like some shit I would do to someone, tbh. I'd be all like OH MY GOD SHE WANTS US TO UNFUCK HER OFFICE. WE WILL CLEAN *ALL* THE THINGS.  SHE WILL BE SO HAPPY WITH THIS GIFT WE GIVE UNTO HER. 

"
64,"I'm sorry that happened to you. It really does suck, and I was thinking of the same thing when it comes to the officer. He's always been such a smiley guy whom I even introduced my parents to a couple months after my wedding. Strange knowing now that during those conversations and while I was talking him up while introducing him to my parents, he was in between the previous and next time he would sleep with my wife.

I'm usually a calm dude who wants the least amount of drama but that part of this is making me feel a bit vindictive. I'll see what I can do after I speak with the lawyer."
65,[deleted]
66,I'm surprised this isn't closer to the top. It's definitely a bad indication for how she'll handle parenting.
67,"&gt; Idk, i thought she was cute.

Tough love from a 29F. 

You do not go up to random girls and touch them. I hate to say this, but your post and comments make you sound like a massive creep. Ew. I mean, you would have had a better chance with this girl if you talked to her ""off"" the dance floor. But no, you decide to go up to her WHILE she is dancing/talking with ANOTHER guy. Sorry, but this is the difference between guys who have it, and those that don't. "
68,"Well, my bullying was targeted over everything, like how can someone bully someone over a sock? But the changes I want are mostly because I want to feel young and beautiful. I thought I would ""feel"" young when I would be older, as a child, looking at mirror and not feeling young or at 18 looking at mirror and seeing a 29 year old woman sucks. This is what I want to change, but the bullying part just made it worse for me. I mean, even if I did not get bullied, I would still want to get injections as I simply would go from 6 to a solid 9 (as told by many people). 

It has to do with my country, we are very similar to South Korea as in that we would have advertisements for plastic surgeries and hospitals in busses, on tv, etc. Beauty standards are really high for my country."
69,"It's kind of like watching let's plays but live. There's a chatroom that everyone can see and take part in.

I'm not really big into it, but it's not really ""friendship"". You know how with shows like Top Gear the draw of the show is the presenters and their jokes rather than the actual cars? Same sort of thing. 

The only time I really used twitch has been for a podcast that's streamed live, but tbh I prefer to wait a few days for them to release it on YouTube/soundcloud. "
70,"Hubs just got back home from 22 days of business travel over 9 different time zones.  He's sick and exhausted, but I am so glad he is home.  Best news- he doesn't have to travel for the foreseeable future.  It's been a long last couple months with him being gone so much."
71,"I can see why you think the streamer did not deserve the money, I think 4.5K just in one donation is beyond absurd too. But why do they deserve the debt? They certainly don't deserve that either. They shouldn't suffer because someone decided on their own to donate them a large sum of money.

But the fact is that he donated it anyway, and yes I don't know why he donated it, neither does she, but because of that she can't go claiming that he must have been scammed or forced to donate it. Not only does she not know if that is true, it very likely isn't. What can a streamer do to scam someone for 4.5K? The streamer doesn't know who are watching to begin with. And even if it were a scam, nobody would fall for it 30 times in a row."
72,"""I think I may have made a mistake in asking you to be my girlfriend.  Goodbye."""
73,"This is really weird post and kind of hard to read

If she has a boyfriend and you are not him, then you should look for another girl to flirt with and ask out.  It's pretty simple.  She thinks of you as a friend, so be a friend.  Don't be a /r/niceguys guy"
74,"It's not objectiveness that's the issue. You can take an objective view of the state of your marriage without treating your marriage like you're weighing a business decision. There is no justification for that. If things happened in your early marriage that make you unable to see your wife in any way other than a business decision, then you should seek counseling or get a divorce. 

I think the language people use on these posts say a lot about who they are. Typically, people try to put themselves in a good light and they have time to think about their words before they type them, so it is always alarming to me when people's damaging views and attitudes shine through here. Because of this, I think the way you spoke about your wife says a lot about your view of your marriage."
75,exactly. 12 you can still find. 13 gets into special sizes territory.
76,"Why do you blame him in the title, but in the story you seem to be neutral on the blame?

That is the issue I see."
77,"&gt; Remind her that this is not a change in your relationship status, goals, timeline, anything.

Really? I mean, it quite literally is. If we both have a rough plan that we're aiming to buy a house in 2020 together, and then the next time we talk about it I'm like nah forget that I'm going to buy my own house in one year... That's a definitive change in plans. "
78,"I guess because this bond is based on *excluding* rather than including or sharing. That's pretty silly, honestly, if you think it's only valuable as long as you can prevent other people from enjoying it, and that sharing this happiness would somehow diminish your own.

Again, this is just YMMV stuff, but hard to pull the ""hey you thinking this is silly is hating"" card when the thing that's being called silly is itself kinda mean-spirited."
79,"Thank you, that was pretty helpful. She did say something along the lines of the ring being ""our contract,"" which just doesn't make sense to me. The marriage license is our contract. 

It's a small company, and her boss is getting old, she keeps saying ""who knows how long we'll be around for, we will have the best price."" Argh. "
80,"What part of ""no"" don't you understand? She rejected your advances, get over it. You shouldn't be trying to get with your co- workers anyhow. Just leave her and all your other co-workers alone and that's it."
81,"I have a very hard time grasping the concept of someone doing this kind of thing with good intentions. It's just too cruel to me, but we clearly have different opinions on what is acceptable behavior and what isn't. So we'll just have to agree to disagree. Have a great day yourself."
82,"This is the rule I'm familiar with and probably the reason she's freaking out. If not living together is a sore point for her because she wants a more serious relationship, then this is just external confirmation to her fears and probably stings quite a bit. "
83,"I understand this firsthand. Before I was married, I was this insecure. I didn't want my boyfriend to go ANYWHERE without me (grocery store, gas station) in case there was a woman there. At his job, he worked with primarily older / less attractive women, but if he didn't, I might have tried to interfere with his job. It got to the point where I truly wanted to lock him in a closet so he could never see another woman again - not on TV or even in a magazine, because I was sure he'd leave me. And then I realized - ""But what if he THINKS about other women?"" and I cried for days because I did not have the technology to implant a chip in his brain so he could never think of another woman. 
 
I was very, very sick. My boyfriend could not save me. I needed to see a therapist. I did eventually make that call when I realized that I was going to lose him if I didn't change. Please understand that YOU CANNOT CHANGE YOUR GIRLFRIEND. You cannot use logic and reason and sanity to get her to see reality. You can't love her through this. SHE IS VERY SICK. She does not see reality the way that you do. She needs professional help. This is not a ""Hee hee she should talk to someone"" post - I am telling you that she is seriously, desperately sick, and it is destroying your relationship, and it is destroying HER LIFE, and if you were blind in both eyes and locked in a box and could never see or hear or talk to another woman, she would STILL cry herself to sleep every night because she can't stop you from THINKING about another woman and she would feel desperately threatened. 

She MUST get therapy. And if she refuses, then you can't stay with  her. Without therapy, she will never, ever, ever get better. "
84,"I think keeping your mouth shut about something like this just to save yourself a little trouble is extremely cowardly, so looks like we're definitely in disagreement. "
85,Yeah everyone says their contract is ironclad until they are spending their savings on lawyers trying to uphold it.
86,"I mean...to be honest, writing out thoughts and feelings that are difficult to express is a healthy way to communicate imo.

Regardless, I agree completely with your second paragraph. OP needs to get out.  "
87,"I agree, he has been saying for years that ""he doesn't know how to be man"". ""Adulting"" has been a slow plod. 

Hi parents didn't really parent him, he was the youngest so there was no sex talk, no money talk, no real relationship or discussion. His father did a lot of shouting, berating and occasional slapping and shoving especially when my husband wasn't prompt, or efficient. This led to him being evasive, good at lying and sneaking around. He doesn't think things through and often acts on impulse. "
88,"And here we see the reality of how different perspectives really change an event. This could be seen as a cute little thing she did to show affection, or it could be seen as an indication that she doesn't understand normal social behaviors."
89,"It wouldn't bother me at all but I'm not you.

You're you and it bothered you.

I think breaking up before you've even said ""Don't lick me, it's gross"" and given her a chance to not lick you is a bit soon, but you do you.

Incidentally, if you're willing to stop seeing her immediately over this then you're not all that invested in her."
90,"Is a ""private dance"" a lap dance?  Like was she touching you other than the kiss?

I think you need to tell her.  Unless she'd previously said lap dances were okay, even without the kiss, it was cheating.  Strippers are people, so unless your fiancee has said otherwise, doing anything with a stripper is cheating if it would be cheating to do it with a friend in her apartment or with a random woman at a bar.

You need to tell her.  Nothing will breed more resentment than her finding out from someone else, which seems somewhat inevitable.  The longer you go without telling her, the worse the betrayal will be."
91,"Links aren't allowed here, but I googled ""Hungary spa dress code"" and the first result gave a fairly comprehensive guide. The upshot was, racy swimwear is fine at the late night Saturday spa parties, but the rest of the time, a swimsuit with a decent amount of cover is expected - not necessarily a one-piece, but not overly skimpy either. The comment about men in Borat style suggests that you won't necessarily get thrown out for going against the grain, but you'll get some looks for it from other guests.

From that, I draw that your husband is right and what you're proposing to wear is probably not really appropriate (except to the Saturday night parties). That is probably true regardless of your weight, but honestly, being overweight is going to make your pushing of the boundaries much more noticeable, and much less forgivable. It isn't fair, but slim, very conventionally attractive people can often get away with pushing the envelope just a little more than us mere mortals.

I think you should rethink this. What about a retro-style bikini with a bit more cover? There's got to be a middle ground between wearing a muu-muu and letting it all hang out, y'know?"
92,Thank you for your very reassuring words. I will try to give her space and time but I am just afraid she will think I am abandoning her if I do so. I don't want to lose her.
93,"Me and my friends are in the age where they are looking for arranged marriage matches, and we've all started encountering aunties who make statements like those.  Like the kind where it sounds mean but you aren't sure if they are being mean or not."
94,and has suicidal tendences... It's like an invitation
95,Exactly - and not even because of anything she's doing but just by existing in her natural body. 
96,"So, unless these two things (driving while shopping on a phone, talking to your boss about a fight) are indicative of her immaturity or disregard for you, then I think I'd give her some time to process what she done. She still in defensive mode, and is trying to save face. You caught her doing something very dangerous, she's still in defensive mode if Chris had to express that her part in what happened wasn't okay, and you've let her know you aren't comfortable with her talking with Chris about this. I'm not saying put on a bright smile and forget what happened, but I would give her some time before discussing at a more emotionally neutral time. You just got back last night, maybe have another discussion Wed/Thurs evening?"
97,"All of this, and it sounds like he doesn't even see her as a co-parent since he obviously makes every decision and tells her that her feelings don't matter and his religion and feelings override hers.

She was nothing more than an incubator for his child and now a nanny to raise their child exactly how he sees fit.

99,"Agreed. I want babies someday, but I don't really care about anyone else's baby unless they are a close blood relative. And even then, newborn babies really aren't that cute. "
100,"Again you mention spending money. Spending money doesn't equal getting sex. Having fun together doesn't equal having sex. Being sexually attracted to someone who is attracted to you AND has compatible values about sexual activity equals having sex. 

I get that it is frustrating. Staying in the relationship means continuing that frustration. "
101,"Oh man I'm sorry...he most definitely made this situation long distance. Not only that, I can assume his backing out of moving there as well created your current living situation...one where he can't stay over...if you guys were originally going to live together. 

Any long distance relationship needs plans for the long distance portion to close. And if the relationship didn't start out long distance, that all needs to be discussed/agreed upon prior to it starting. That didn't happen here. You were very clear you wanted to have a job close to him. You were willing to move for him. You made plans to do so. And then, he decided not to. Because he got a raise. You committed to moving with him, and he backed out. And now, he expects you to upend your life again because he changed his mind? 

For arguments sake, let's say you stay with him, and you talk about closing the distance again. He doesn't budge on wanting you to move, again, to the city where he is now. You leave your new job after not holding it for very long. Maybe you can get an offer again at the same place that offered you one where he is. Maybe you burned that bridge. Maybe even you get a *better* job in the city where he is. And you move. And in a year, maybe two, he gets another job offer somewhere else. One where his current employer won't match the salary for him to stay. And he decides he's moving. You upended your life twice already, and he expects you to do it again. All the while continuing to not compromise? Just...no.

103,"&gt; He probably doesn't like cooking and cleaning, but most of us do these things because we have to, not because we want to do them all the time. He might be under the impression that you don't mind doing all the work because you have ""ambition"" or because you have higher standards of cleaning or because you never complained or whatever.


I just want to thank you for this comment.  My fiance is a lot more... finicky (for lack of a better word) about cleanliness than I am.  He never complains, but I feel like he's been stressing a lot lately and reading this comment has motivated me to be more proactive.  I mean don't get me wrong... I am not OP's SO at all.  I work 40 hours a week and I still put in a few hours a week towards the housework, but I know my SO does a lot more than I do.  One of the things my fiance is stressed about is needing to rescreen the windows and your comment motivated me to get on Amazon and buy the materials so that I can at least do a few windows this weekend.

Thank you again for the perspective.

"
104,"Well it sounds to me like the better option is for her to find a job that is going to bring in an actual livable income, not expect you to work two jobs."
105,"This is great advice and what my fiance and I did. I highly recommend going ring shopping together and trying on different styles that you think you may like. Tell him what you do/don't like about different styles and at the end of the day pick your top ones you like best. I picked three. What you think you will like is not always what you really like, which is why I recommend seeing them in person. This way he can buy the ring himself, but you can rest assured that you will love it."
106,"Depends on how he handles it in the next few hours. If he goes with ""yes I have an addiction and I want help to get better"" Uncle Sam and his wife may play ball. If he stays defensive about his decisions and lies, it's going to get ugly. Well, uglier."
107,"&gt; She could have lived a very comfortable life with me

A life of being cheated on is not a comfortable life. She made her choice, you still don't seem to respect it.

You are *not* her friend. Her friend would warn her not to listen to her jealous ex. Your motives are the opposite of pure. Do the decent thing and leave her alone."

109,Right? Like the money would still be gone but he wouldn't have just *given* it away. Dude needs a mental health evaluation 
110,"I guess I'm not sure why he's unhappy with the thought of being 'tied together' in the eyes of the government if he has in fact made the commitment to stick it out to the end. If anything, I believe it is beneficial to couples who HAVE made that commitment for the government to recognize that. 

Like I said, some people just don't appreciate all the rigamarole that goes along with getting married. The important part is that a) he's willing to do it because it is important to you and b) he is in fact committed and putting all the weight on that that anyone marrying should. It might be hard to figure out whether he's just going through the motions, and that's what's holding me up, but you know him and he seems very selfless and caring. He's probably just a skeptic of why it has to be formalized. "

113,"If she thinks she's still friends with you and you just ignore her at the ball, that will create a lot of drama. It's better to start showing her that you aren't friends now, so she isn't surprised at the ball."
114,"I do think the issue is you aren't bothering to really listen, especially when the conversation involves making plans which should set off a ""PAY ATTENTION"" alarm bell in your head. But yeah, that person was clearly in a bad mood. Just try harder, be honest if you don't remember something so you can be reminded, write things down when you can, etc., but this is a pretty common issue and I'm sure you'll figure out a method that works for you."
115,Or the opposite. Maybe she's been telling everyone they are doctor-astronauts and doesn't want everyone to find out she's been lying.

129,"You can definitely abuse pot. It may not have the addictive and withdrawal effects of harder drugs but if it inhibits parts of your life, i.e. People who need to constantly be high, or say are not willing to give it up if it puts their baby at risk, it is considered abuse. 

It's not 100% safe. Smoking/ burning anything releases carcinogens. Smoke travels in the house. And I believe tests have shown that  weed has negative effects on the development of youth who are still growing, even as old as teenagers. "

131,"That isn't what I was saying at all.  The issue here is the BF doesn't like the dog IN the bed.  Unless her doctor prescribed the dog literally touching OP at all times, the dog being 1 foot further away on the floor would accomplish the same thing and resolve this issue entirely.

If however the doctor did recommend for OP to be physically no more than 1 foot away from this animal at all times, she should likely get a second opinion."
132,"Maybe you should switch medication if your anxiety isn't being controlled properly. Your bf does have a point about the ticks, but if your dog isn't actually in bed with you- is in his own bed beside you, I think that's fine? You should work on communication with your bf so that he can talk to you and calm you down; I imagine he probably feels like you're relying more on the dog than you are on him and that the dog's better than him in a sense? Also... have you thought about what would happen to your anxiety if your dog passed away? It could be time to work on other routes of relieving your stress :)"
133,it's not because she's younger than you. it's because she's a pile of shit. she is a terrible person and the fact that you even helped raise her daughter shows you are 1000x better than this turd lady. u will meet MUCH better women than her in ur future.

138,"Your wife chose not to cut him out of her son's life, and now you two have to live with that. 

Developmentally,  the best thing for her son is for his dad to be a consistent, stable,  positive presence in his life. 

It is vital for her son to see his father as a good person. Developmentally, thinking his father is ""bad"" can really hurt a kid.  At 8, a lot of his identity is based on his parents.  If his dad is a monster,  he must be a monster.  Read up on child psychology and development. Even when the parent has abused the child,  you have to be very delicate in how you explain it to the kid. 

So, no bad talking his dad. Make peace with dad being around for important events like birthdays,  sport games,  graduations. 
I'm sorry. 

You may want to get counseling.  If nothing else, it's an hour a week where you can vent about this shit stain with impunity, but it should also give you tools to cope.  This is a seriously shitty position to be in. 

She needs to make sure she's got eagle eyes for the slightest whiff of abuse.  And I also think she needs therapy if she hasn't already.  That she's putting her child in harm's way so her abuser can play happy family is a bad sign."
139,I'm questioning if your husband knows what blackmail is. Does he mean extortion? Because blackmail would involve you threatening to release something scandalous about him. 
140,Nothing good will come from acting on your feelings. Regardless of how you feel or what label he has that man is still your father and guardian. You still have unresolved issues from a bad childhood and you need some therapy and professional help. You don't have to tell your stepdad anything about your feelings right now and why you might need the therapist. Just tell him you've experienced a lot of loss and want to talk it out with a licensed 3rd party.
141,"Until the parents learn to step it up or give up the child, it doesn't seem like there's anything you can do other than throw money into the dark hole of their greed or refuse to contribute to their lifestyle.

Parents like that can't see past themselves and if you give them money to help with the kid, I'm afraid it will do little good and commode to supporting the parents wasteful lifestyle."
142,"Jesus I'm not conservative at all but I'd be pretty shocked if everyone suddenly pulled out coke at a house party. You've clearly normalised that lifestyle but putting a guest in that position is a bit rude (she's stuck staying in that house with them), and it was a misjudgement on your part especially knowing she's religious and your family is all very anti drugs."
143,"Hormones will be a problem for months after the pregnancy. If she breastfeeds, they'll be effecting her the whole time she breastfeeds, she'll also likely feel ""touched out"" (look it up). 

Also, hormones effect *you*. There is literature showing that the dad's hormones change during pregnancy and after the birth as well. So the pregnancy is impacting you as well. 

Yes, the pregnancy is the catalyst. But that is a fairly long term problem.

If this is just hormones, this is going to get worse before there is any chance of it getting better. 

She should ask her OB/midwife to do an evaluation for prenatal depression/anxiety. You should talk to your doctor about your mood as well. Couples counseling is worth a try.

As things are? You sound so checked out, so disinterested in your partner, and your conflicting complaints indicates that she can do nothing right. This relationship, right now, is *unhealthy*. And it will NOT get better without serious work on both your ends. It could get worse.

All the time, we tell pregnant women to end unhealthy relationships. I would bet money that if your partner posted her side, people would be warning her that she doesn't have much time and if you don't fix things soon she should end it. We would be pointing out the red flags and that this could escalate to abuse. 

So, yeah, I think you should consider ending this. Find out from a lawyer how much child support you'll likely be paying and set up a direct deposit into her account. Find a family therapist so you two can work out how to be good co parents to your baby. Get an apartment that is baby appropriate and buy your own crib/etc, even though you won't be getting overnights for a *long* damn time.

And if you really can't stand the idea of losing her? *Shape the fuck up*. 

I have not seen a SHRED of sympathy from you. "
144,CPS won't remove this child. They don't remove the child except in extreme cases. Mom will get a talking to and maybe some parenting classes or check-ins 
145,"The mom thing is really deep. He probably has a really warped perception of women/bodies/fitness from growing up around that plus the insta/diet girls. 

If he's your fiancé would you be comfy having him come to the doc w/ you? Maybe if he understood more about your medical condition and heard a professional affirm your health that could help? 

Honestly though, it sounds like he needs some hard reprogramming. I'm definitely someone who's gone from ""my body needs to look like insta models or else it's awful"" to ""everyone is hot omg human shapes are beautiful"". And I think what it took was realizing other good options were even out there, if that makes sense. I wonder if you could point your fiancé towards more full figured female athletes, and if it were my relationship I might find it fun to explore different images together with my partner looking at what a wide range body shapes can be sexy and start conversations that take food (and exercise) as nourishment that feeds your whole body which is a system you love not means to this societally ideal image of an end that is all about the calorie ledger "

Plus I think it's the context that matters. It wasn't a ""goodbye I love you"" peck, it was a ""I'm sad comfort me"" peck that might have been more if you didn't stop it.

My theory is that she did it because she needs men in her life and, currently, you're the man in her life. She was drunk so that's something but I would still be skeeved if my mom tried that on me drunk or not."
149,She claimed she only said that because she was mad and that she didn't mean it. I'm just having a hard time accepting her apology this time.

153,"Some of the comments here are so cold. He literally raised these girls for the majority of their lives. I can tell from the post that OP feels attached to these girls - which is unsurprising as he is essentially their guardian at this point. Honestly, there are so any children out there that don't even get half this quality of care. I'm honestly amazed at what a good job OP has done. He sounds like an amazing parent. Just telling him to coldly leave what is essentially the family he built is so confusing to me. 

OP - have you thought of adopting the girls and moving your family to your new location? I think it's something that you should think thoroughly about. 

What would your life be without them? You'd have more time for dating, hobbies, furthering your career. Would your thoughts always wander to how the girls were doing? How often would you Skype? Would there be yearly visits during the holidays? Would you transition to being a cousin-type figure that they'd see every couple of years?

How about your life with them? Has caring for them prevented you from other opportunities such as dating, etc.? Will caring for them limit you in your new career role? How attached are you? 

These are questions to ask yourself. "
154,"He's the one who will look stupid, talking to someone who isn't responding. It can be hard to keep a straight face when ignoring someone so feel free to distract yourself with a phone, a piece of paper, or by turning and talking to someone else.

The only thing I'd say to this dude is ""DON'T talk to me."" Just once every time he tries. Then ignore him until he stops trying. 

He sounds like a fucking lunatic. Don't be afraid to call security or police if he escalates. It's unlikely but I'd be careful he isn't following you when you're alone etc. Hopefully he will give up when he realizes you're not playing his game."
155,"If your mother only cared for your grandmother under the pretense of payment, she should have had an employment contract drafted. The estate is only ""owed"" to whom the person who passed wants it to be owed. 

I think being straight forward and not keeping secrets is a good policy to have, but this only applies to people willing to be reasonable. Your mother is allowing her hurt feelings regarding her mother to impact how she behaves around her son, and she's dismissing the very real work that you're putting in to help your grandmother (something that's not your responsibility) as somehow less meaningful than what she did. I think you can choose not to participate in conversations about this topic with her moving forward because of this behavior.

In the meantime, I would respond to any comments about the estate from your mom or grandma with ""Talk to your [mother/daughter]."" Let them work it out, or not, and then follow whatever legal duties you have as executor."

I stopped talking to him immediately, but our mutual friends still all hang out with him because ""they don't want to be involved/it isn't their business"". They all agree that if they were me/my bf they would have reacted the same way and that it's a super gross, disrespectful thing for him to do, but since it doesn't directly effect any of them they continue being friends. I still hang out with some of them casually, but I definitely don't consider them close friends anymore.

For this it's just cut your losses and find someone more compatible."
169,"Every choice you make in life means you will miss out on the choices you didn't take. No one can experience everything. You have to learn to live with the feeling of missing out on something. If you break up with her, you will miss out on the experience of growing old with your high school sweetheart. A vague feeling of ""missing out"" isn't the best reason to do something. You are always missing out on something. Choosing to do something else won't get rid of that feeling."

171,"You spend a lot of time and energy defending and ""clarifying"" for your mom. Look at your responses on this thread alone and count how many times you do it. 

My mom is overall a wonderful lady with no ill will behind what she does. She has lots of friends, she cares about others, she's funny, interesting, and giving. 

However, it's not my job to defend her. She showed up at my house one day when she knew my husband would be gone to pressure and guilt trip me about convincing my husband to buy a house closer to her (I am the Keeper Of The Grandbabies), and then swore me to secrecy. I'm sure she has some kind of neurosis or diagnosable condition that drives this behavior, and she isn't thinking ""I'm going to hurt my daughter today"". But again, none of that erases the terrible nature of her dysfunctional behavior. It's not my job to make light of it. It's not my job to defend her character. What she did was wrong and unhealthy. Period, end of story. It doesn't mean I don't love her, it doesn't mean she's a bad person. 

What it does mean is that I need to engage in our relationship in a very specific way so that **I** am healthy, happy, and secure. It means I need to enforce certain boundaries and not tolerate certain behaviors--again, this doesn't mean she is bad or I don't love her. It's called self-care. It's not my job to manage my mother's emotional shit. She can go to therapy or drink a glass of wine if she needs to deal, but it's not my problem. I don't take responsibility for her feelings anymore. I don't need to go around convincing other people that she just doesn't know what she's doing. I don't care that she doesn't know. She needs to stop doing it, and if she won't stop then I will have to establish a boundary. That's it. It's not an emotional thing, it's just a fact of life.

Stop defending your mom."
172,"&gt;He makes snide remarks when we have the slighter disagreement (for example just now he forgot to turn at me street when he was dropping me odd and said ""oh shit, i guess I better get 1800flowers on the line since that's what we do now."")

Has he ever gotten you flowers?  That he's making jokes about getting you flowers when he annoys you or upsets you makes me wonder if maybe it's more about him feeling like you buying him flowers was you pointing out that he's never done the same for you.  Maybe he feels like in the past when he's messed up he should have done something like buy you flowers and now that he realizes that he's getting defensive about the fact that he hasn't by joking about doing it.

It definitely feels like it's coming from a place of insecurity rather than being bothered by the gesture itself."

But I do not agree with it. There is a difference between creating actual business connections yourself and having previous coworkers that will verify your work ability based on experience, versus having your daddy send a single email to his department. I would be very pissed if I were you, but I would try to hide it from your boyfriend to an extent. It's not really his fault, but I don't think you're a bad girlfriend at all for feeling this way."

179,"First, both of you need to contact CPS.

Second, your boyfriend needs to go to counseling, for his, your, and his sister's sake.  Of course he is going to have a violent reaction to anything that pisses him off - he learned his anger management skills from watching his volatile parents after all.  And of course he's going to get pissed off, he grew up with what his sister just faced and of course doesn't want her to deal with it.

But if he is going to take care of his sister or have an adult loving relationship with you then he needs to learn how to deal with and communicate his anger without causing physical harm to himself or his environment.

In the short term, for his sister's sake, it would be better for her to stay with you  - mom and dad are obviously too self-involved/destructive to give any type of a shit about their children.

Only you know if your relationship with your boyfriend is the type to handle the stress of a child added onto it.

Please call CPS"

181,That's because children are absolutely not supposed to get aspirin.
182,"&gt; They each should get the same amount of money as that was the original point of the gift.

The person giving the gift now thinks that the money should go to the girl most in need of it. He started saving this money ~15 years ago, and a lot can change in 15 years. He started the fund assuming they'd be in equal need, however, they are now not in equal need. 

&gt; Can Maddie start looking into scholarships? Can Maddie look for a job?

OP mentioned that Maddie can get a job but it won't come anywhere near what Chloe can make modelling. 
"
183,"It sounds like maybe you should follow your own advice here? Bob is enabling Richard's choices by being his confidant. You're enabling Bob by helping him deal with what he comes home with. You should draw a hard line on that... you will never listen to anything regarding richard: he's a bad guy, and a bad friend who's using &lt;husband&gt; for free therapy. It'll be awkward but it'll pay dividends in a few months.

On a less popular note, the FWB is in that arrangement consensually. The prostitutes probably (not definitely) are too. While his past actions were certainly immoral, currently they're just a bit skeezy."
184,"Hmm

Let me rephrase: My problem was with how he treated not being able to drive like a inherent weakness that he can't fix. When he was crying he also said that it upsets him greatly to find out that modern love is like that. He refused to accept that things like that is a factor in relationships. This wasn't the kind of thinking that I intended for him to to have when I gave that initial statement about driving. In the next meeting, I asked if there was any revelation that he got from our first ""session"", he said that he decided he isn't going to learn to drive until he finds the ""perfect girl"". His reasoning is that, the perfect girl would love him for who he is not for something as petty as being able to drive. I thought it was bizzare and somewhat unhealthy way of thinking but I didn't comment."
185,"Do not walk, run in the other direction. That level of codependency is not healthy, like enough red flags for a parade in the DPRK levels of unhealthy."
186,"This has to be a troll, right? Please reassure me."
187,"You seem geniunly clueless, so I'm going to try to explain this.

Your wife didn't simple want a proposal. She wanted a commited future with you, which included a buisness, children, marriage and a house. She openly communicated this to you, you agreed, and then you planned this future together. But you kept changing the plan to something she hadn't agreed to without properly discussing it with her. Finally you commited to a plan (you'd propose soon and after she bought the ring herself), but then you change the plan again (by buying a house before marriage and by delaying the marriage as the cost of a buying a house and a wedding are so high you can't do both in a short period of time).

You changed the wedding plans again and again, and after promising her ""soon"" you did it one last time. Finally she lost all faith that you would ever carry through with the your agreement and was angry for leading her on all this time. You argue about it where in you defend your decision to yet again break the agreement. She is so upset that it might be the end of your relationship. Then and only then do you turn around and say ""Oh, so you might actually break up with me. I'd rather marry you than breakup. Here's a proposal. Now you can't dump me.""

You didn't propose because you wanted to marry her. Your didn't propose because you'd agreed to do it. You didn't propose because it was important to her. You proposed as an apology! You turn all her dreams and planning a future together with you into a last ditch minimun effort to stop her from dumping you. That was a slap in her face."
188,"My BF is also not awesome at remembering our conversations, so he's taken to putting reminders in his phone as we talk if what we're discussing relates to a plan or something that's happening on a particular day.

This serves the dual purpose of (1) he has it written down so he can go back and check and (2) he needs to understand it well enough in the first place so he can write it down, so he'll double check and ask clarifying questions in the moment."
189,Try not being so freaking insecure.
190,"Seriously, OP. My kids look so much like my husband. We occasionally overhear total strangers say stuff like ""Look at that guy and his mini-me's!""

Would I like to have a kid that looks a bit like me? I guess. Do I expect my husband to ""fix"" this problem? NO.  My kids are perfect to me just the way they are and I would not change a thing even if I could. 

He's being unreasonable. But I'm guessing it comes from some deep-seeded fear of his. Maybe the fear that you love your family more than him. Or that he's unnecessary and therefore a failure. 

What I'm trying to say is, this objection is so ridiculous on its face that there must be something more behind it. It might not hurt to do some active listening and try to find out where the hurt is really happening for him. "
191,"You're 19. Which means legally you do not need their permission to do these things, stop waiting for it because it will never happen. Just do it.

-Go to the bank and open up your own checking and savings accounts. Take the money from the savings you share with your mother and deposit it into your new account so you are in control of your finances. Do not tell you parents you are doing this beforehand because I have a strong suspicion if you do they will take the money before you can get a hold of it.

-If you do not have a license and your parents are not willing to teach you, you can pay for professional driving lessons. Even only taking one or two will help you pass your drivers exam. This is what I had to do and I had no trouble passing. 

-Get a job. As a legal adult, you do not need their permission to get one. They will cry, scream, rage, and guilt trip you, but you can't let that stop you. 

-Either talk to your university about the possibility of living on campus or start looking for roommates. As long as you live in their house they will never respect your independence. Again, do not let them in on these plans so they don't have the chance to sabotage you."
192,"You keep saying you deserve what he's doing but ask yourself: would you have responded like him if he had been the one who cheated? Would you have threatened his life, hit him , threatened to break his bones?

"
193,"Sometimes people make jokes out of things they're really feeling to ease the awkwardness of saying how you actually feel. It seems like he makes a lot of jokes about you cheating, I'm sure he is jealous but doesn't want to show it. To me that's a red flag, if you're jealous, be jealous. But talk about it. I'm not so focused on the killing part, I think he was more using that as an outrageous line to bring up you cheating but in a way that would be so hard to believe so you wouldn't think he was actually jealous. "
194,"Thanks for the laugh despite of my shitty day. I was perplexed that he was so chill going away for work given the situation, now I realise its probably more so he just doesn't actually give a shit. "
195,"Oh wow. Reading this made my heart sink. I have a cat myself and I cannot imagine how I would react if someone did this to him. Well actually I can, but I don't think ""murder him and hide the body"" is going to sound very constructive as advice. 
I would personally end the engagement over this. This speaks volumes of this man's character in my opinion, and I think he's showing you who he is. He is the kind of guy that will abandon a helpless creature that depends on him in cold blood because it's annoying and/or inconvenient to him. Do with his info what you will, I would personally not be able to overlook it."
196,He wants a threesome.
197,"Um if your gp can afford a yacht
. Why was granddad driving a cab?"
198,"Had a similar experience.  I ignored the enormous red flag because of ""love.""  Get out now. "
199,"For sure. But the rammifications of charging your MIL with theft + whatever else a lawyer could stick on her would be probably be inadvisable for a multitude of reasons. It's definitely a rock and a hard place type situation for OP, which always sucks. "
200,"&gt; Logically he is correct.

No. He is *technically* correct in that OP has never met her niece.

Logically though? *Logically, funerals are for the living*."
201,Ivy is going to be out there as soon as you move out.  You need to stop believing the shit he tells you as he clearly keeps lying.  This baby WILL NOT save your relationship.  You need to decide if you are fine raising a child as a single mother.  You have no idea how stressful children are.  If he was straying when you though everything was good imagine what he will do once the stress is exponentially higher!!
202,"Well, that's a Chris Rock bit.  Doesn't mean he can say it since it's being performed satirically by a black comic in a specific setting, but I guess it's a Michael Scott style fuckup?  And he also didn't stop at saying it, he went on to ACTUALLY justify it so.....

And I refer back to a response I gave to a similar question a week ago: when it comes to your SO being racist, if you have to ask, the answer is probably yes."
203,"I'm discussing the post at hand, which is *about* guns in the home for self defence, and Jim Jeffries standup bit about the exact same topic. I'm not assuming anything, I'm just staying on topic. 

Your guns and their ammo don't need to be stored together or even in your home at all, so they're probably reasonably safe in terms of the risks of having firearms in the home."
204,"They did it, not you. They *chose* to act in shitty horrible ways. Doesn't matter if it's culturally-driven or just them being utter shithole people - they treated you horribly.

I sympathize with the fact that you *want* a loving family - we all do. And generally speaking, no family is *all* bad. People in abusive situations all over can think back to times when their abusers were kind and sweet to them - but that doesn't mean that they weren't abusive. It's just a fucked-up mix of abuse and somewhat good treatment.

Bottom line, though you *wish* you could have a good relationship with your parents, that's not possible. It really sucks. But they chose this, not you. You just wanted a good life with a husband that you love, and you wanted your parents to share in your happiness - and your parents chose to choke the life out of your relationship with them because you wouldn't allow them absolute control over your love life.

Move on, and gather people who treat you well around you. Make *them* your family. Marry this guy and have some kids if you want, and raise them to have happy lives - and you'll be the type of parent who doesn't demand absolute control over your children's lives. Start up some *new* traditional values of love and individuality and support for healthy choices."
205,That's what I was thinking. And there is absolutely no weirdness going on between me and Derek either. It's not like that at all. And I never thought my boyfriend would think anything of it either. Now I feel self-conscious about ever talking to him about him again.
206,"If she still lets you play them on your own, why does it matter if she thinks video games are awful? You said you don't like any of her shows/movies either so I don't see the difference. "
207,"Yeah, I'm thinking this is really the only option"
208,"I'm starting to pick up on the fact that you really want to go regardless of if your wife is uncomfortable or not? From my perspective she is obviously not okay with it! If she was, then she would say go. However, she is saying, I don't want to ruin the tradition.

Basically, I want to say no but that makes me feel like I am ruining something important to you and that makes me feel selfish.

You should tell you wife that you want to start a new tradition with her and that will be celebrating her on Mother's Day. 

"

210,"This is a package deal, man. This cat is like her child. She raised it herself.
The cat is well-behaved and likes you. You hit the jackpot!

Do not expect her to leave her cat at home. You can try asking her to leave Fluffy behind, but chances are she'll get upset and defensive about it for good reason. You're being selfish."
211,"&gt; He was shitty to her in this serious instance, she has a shitty attitude towards him on his views of education (which seems to be a constant thing), and it comes off she doesn't respect his military training and education

I didn't take her first paragraph explaining his attitude that way at all. "
212,No one is dismissing the boyfriend's experience. The boyfriend is the one who's dismissing her education. Pointing out that a college education is good across the board and teaches good life skills does not automatically mean that the person supporting education thinks that people who didn't go to college can't have good jobs and careers.
213,"There are better ways of doing this. *ugh*. 

For one, you messed up by doing it in a public place. And in an uber with her friends. Messed up again by the way you said it. You don't say ""you're fat"", and especially 3 times, goodness sakes. You say ""I'm concerned about your health/weight""etc. AND say it in a private area when you have her full attention. 

I'd be furious if my SO told me ""my tummy is big"". 

Maybe just apologize for the way you said it. If she doesn't accept it then, there's not much you can do from there. "
214,"THIS. OP this one can be important. My first time i couldn't get it up because i was so nervous. Just be patient with him if that happens. It's definitely not you. If he can't, just tell him it's ok and cuddle with him or something to make him feel more comfortable. "
215,"This response OP. And please, if she does decide to break it off, resist the temptation to tell her that you don't want kids just to save the relationship. You need to be completely honest with her and yourself. "
216,"I'd be shocked if my sister intentionally hurt someone on duty. That's the weird thing, she seems to have deep empathy for strangers, and at any rate highly values her professional reputation. But she can't handle emotional intimacy and is most abusive to the people closest to her. Her relationships have always been a cluster fuck.

Basically, what /u/sockalicious just said."
217,"Hire a lawyer, talk with an accountant, run a credit check etc.  My guess is a lawyer will tell you to legally separate to limit how much financial damage he can do.  Try to keep a cool head handle the situation with the seriousness needed. 

Having gone through a horrible situation myself my advice is funnel your energy into handling the practical aspects of taking care of yourself/child.  Stonewall the emotional fallout as long as possible.  Crying won't stop him from mortgaging the house to pay some creepy BBW whore.  I am sorry this is happening to you."
218,"Then my honest advice is for both of you to back off of him, moreso you than her. You're almost ten years his senior, you two really shouldn't have anything in common and its creepy."
219,"The groceries thing is actually probably a good way to make him see his rigidity is not actually very practical. It's concrete. For example, how would you split things like purchasing milk, or peanut butter, 50/50? What if one person likes to buy the expensive peaches and one doesn't? And, of course, as a man he is bound to eat more, and also probably more of the expensive items in particular (i.e. meat). If he thinks about it for just 5 seconds, it should become clear that splitting things mine/yours just doesn't make sense for a couple, and he needs to think more organically and flexibly about this -- whatever ""flexible"" will look like for the two of you.

Good luck. I would feel a little dissed by a conversation that rigid too, and the implications of the money attitudes he's expressing. Of course it's not personal, this seems very clearly related to his feelings about his parents' divorce, but still. Not reasonable. I feel like he should be able to see better the ways in which he is framing this issue are a bit offensive to you and destructive to sharing life as a co-habiting couple."
220,"You ignored the whole rest of the message. You are using your mental illness as an excuse to swear at your SO and be mean to her when she's cooking for you. It's pretty rude to make someone go through the whole recipe with you so it meets your standards. You could just eat half of your portion and replace the rest with fruit and yogurt, and just be grateful for a sweet woman."
221,"There's a difference between living with roommates and living with a significant other.  That difference is what I would be thinking of if I told you that ""you're young, enjoy it"" (rather than the whole ""go out and party every night"" bit)

There's a certain joy in having your very own place to go home to. Moving in with a boyfriend is a larger emotional investment, and the sacrifices you make will be larger than just having a roommate.  You have plenty of time to experience living with a signicant other, but not so much time to live alone. 

Ultimately, it's your decision. "
222,"I can see some some off color jokes that were cool between them as inside jokes being massively inappropriate when taken out of that context. 

I am black guy with a white fiancee and if you uploaded half of our inappropriate texts without context we would both look racist. "
223,"If this is happening, it's still really bothersome and undermining OP's sense of security and sanity, even if it's little stuff with no sentimental value.

It's like living with cleanfreaks who always reorganize your things, so you never know where anything is and sometimes it gets thrown away."
224,"As an adopted person myself, I have nothing to say other than your wife is cruel and wildly misinformed about adoption and the way families work. I would seek counseling for her personally, and couples counseling together with a different counselor. She obviously has issues she needs to work through. 

But honestly, can you live with someone who said that about your brother, your family, for the rest of your life? Truly take some time to reflect. Because I sure as hell couldn't. "
225,"I think a big part is the level of effort expended. You don't have to do anything to daydream about your co-worker or whoever. But these people are going through the effort of going to their Facebook, looking through their pictures for one they like, and then saving it for later. That's a lot of concrete actions that aren't as easy to brush off as ""heat of the moment"" fantasizing. It's more deliberate, which is why it's seen as less acceptable. "
226,"Hi OP. I was in a long distance relationship for 6 years, and we moved in together one year ago. Sex went from being GREAT to nearly non-existent. I'm not sure if I'm just usually not a horny person and it all got bundled up into the two weeks every few months or what. I am definitely facing some depression due to issues with finding work (so very similar to your situation, minus the porn).

*But I feel bad that we don't have sex.* I constantly tell my boyfriend that I love him and that it is not his fault. If your husband was slowing down because of the increased frequency or depression, he wouldn't hurt your self-esteem, I think.... 

Just something to keep in mind. I second the people suggesting having the porn addiction looked into."
227,Most bras shouldn't go in the dryer. 
228,"Was curious about this too. At first it sounded like a massive gain, but towards the end it sounded much more minimal. Makes a huge difference in terms of the convo OP wants to have!"
229,"I was about to comment this! Dude's entire post history is about HPV.

OP, the comment above me is right. You don't have the right to disclose other people's health conditions."
230,"If you can't have cake, nobody can?"
231,"Snapchat: you need to tell her your last line, that you're at work and just because you don't SC her doesn't mean you don't love her.

The children thing: she's right on this one. You can't go with the flow on it. Unless they explicitly don't want children, people tend to want children *more* over time, not less. Right now let's say you're 80/20 on wanting children in 15 years. She wants a life partner. 20% you won't be that person, and those odds won't get better. 

I'd tell her to leave and go find someone she can be 100% about. She's 23. In the next 10 years she could meet many men who know what they want in terms of children better than you currently do. And that's fine. You're 22, I didn't know what I wanted at 22 either. But if you can't get on the same page about having children, it's going to be a deal breaker.

Reading your other responses, it seems like you either don't understand the extent to which plans for children make or break relationships, or why she's willing to break off a relationship because of it. It's because if she gets it wrong, she has to refuse your requests for a lifetime, and it will probably break the relationship later. That's a shitty deal to take if you know the stakes beforehand."
232,"You guys need to pump the brakes a little here and act with some sensibility. What you are in is infatuation. You both need to realize that. Love at first sight is just really strong infatuation. You're both either pushing 30 or 30 and haven't realized this. You might feel a strong connection but love is a really strong word to use for someone you've never been physical with. What if his physical kinks are something you find revolting? What if you like something during sex that he absolutely abhors? What if he has terribly bad breath when you go to kiss him or nasty stink from getting sweaty and not washing properly?

Pump the brakes and ease up before you plunge head first into a relationship. Date a little while and see if you guys are compatible. Regardless of whether you'll lose your job or not."
233,"I don't see a problem with asking them for a different seat. Just say ""The relationship hasn't been going well and if we could get seated at a different table, then we would enjoy your wedding a lot more. Thanks, sorry about this.""
"
234,"I thought this was odd too. Regardless of whether or not my SO and I arrive at a wedding together, we discuss it multiple times and I make sure he knows what the plan is. I'm the super organized one and he is more scatter-brained. OP could have taken more care to outline the day's plan with him. "
235,"He's clearly miserable about something. Things cannot continue like this. If he refuses to communicate or address these issues, you have some decisions to make."
236,"I worked in restaurants for years during high school and college, and dated a career server for 4 years. You know what pisses servers off? Poor tipping. Parents who don't care that their kids throw shit all over the floor. The old guys who hit on me or the people who think they can treat you like dirt because you're working a blue collar job. 

I guarantee you that the server wasn't offended. She's not going home, flopping down on her couch next to her significant other like ""oh my god babe this girl was *so rude,* she didn't even know what her order was and LOOKED AT THE MENU while I was talking can you even believe it?"" 

Your boyfriend is projecting and it's probably a good idea to do some analysis of your relationship and how well it's working."
237,"&gt; This is the first time something like this has happened but I'm devastated. Should I leave her?

It sorta sounds like you're using this as your excuse, to be honest. I mean, if my wife got a massage from another dude, I'd be livid... but I wouldn't even dream of leaving her for it. Particularly because it's a first offense.

This is where you say ""I understand that you don't think this is wrong, but you've crossed a boundary here."" Then go from there."
238,"That doesn't mean the other party has to reciprocate, which given that he's known her since she was 8, makes him look pretty fucking bad."
239,"You've obviously made up your mind about fucking over your brother, so i'm not sure why you're here asking for advice. What do you want people to tell you? That it's a good idea? It's not. It's a terrible idea that will do nothing but fracture your family. You don't want to have a relationship with this woman, you want to seek retribution on your brother for the perceived injustices you say he frequented on you while you were growing up. You're a 30 year old man, but you are acting like a petulant child. You don't **HAVE** to speak to your brother. You don't **HAVE** to worm yourself into their relationship. You choose to do these things and you're choosing to break up their family. The consequences of what happens are all yours to bear. "
240,"Were you going to be the uber driver? Is that how you were going to make back the money? If it was just a straight refund from the party bus, then what's the problem? You can't pre-pay for a uber, right? Can you explain the problem a little more? I can't see how an uber would fit more people than a limo. "
241,"In the 12-Step community, where we are encouraged to make amends for our past transgressions, we recognize that it isn't always possible to make direct amends to those we hurt, especially when it might harm them further. When that's the case, we are encouraged to make living amends. In this case, you do run the risk of further hurting that man. So, you might consider a living amends - like working with at-risk LGBTQ youth, for instance. I also recommend that you find a therapist to work this through with; guilt and shame can be extremely toxic."
242,"100% your other coworker is in on this. Think about it. You and Chris show up to work at the same time holding coffee cups from the same shop. Your coworker went back and reported this to Chris's wife in order to fan the flames of this nonexistent affair. 

&gt;This time it says ""I can see why Jason dumped your skanky ass"". Jason was my ex fiancee. I had talked about him briefly to Chris and other colleagues during my first week as he was a big reason as to why I moved here in the first place.

I'm also betting that this info came from your female coworker rather than Chris. 

You are fighting a two front war here OP. "
243,yeah I think thats what I'm planning man...think its the fear of going back home and being single. Just needed to hear the truth
244,"The only thing that I really find problematic here, *aside from fucking online shopping while driving*, is that he's your boss.  If he wasn't your boss, I don't really see anything wrong with venting/blowing off steam to friends or wanting an outside opinion on an argument you had. 

But.  He's your boss.  That makes it wildly inappropriate.  You don't need *your boss* hearing about every tiff you and your girlfriend have.  You don't need your boss knowing intimate details of your dating life.

I know that this sub is known for telling people to break up over the slightest issue, but dude, I would rethink your relationship with this girl over the shopping and driving.  That is an entirely new level of stupid and makes me question her judgement about every other aspect of her life.  Everyone knows how stupid and dangerous it is to text and drive, but fucking *shopping*!?  I would not be able to get over it and I would worry about her every time she's driving anywhere.  And I sure as shit would not have apologized for throwing her phone in the back seat.  I would have thrown it out the window."
245,"So, should those other girls hide themselves? "
246,He might have an issue stemming from abuse or a phobia that your parents are trying to work on and you just rolled in being rude. How about talking to your parents and showing some real concern?

This is literally none of your goddamned business."
248,"It sounds like he's trying to control you in subtle ways, and he's trying to normalize it so he can push for more control later. Be careful of partners who want you to change who you are in order to make them feel better, especially when it means cutting yourself off from other people."
249,"I think you need to explain that you have no expectation of seeing her more than you do currently, address the actual issue of this is what it is.

It's silly to me, but I can understand someone feeling that if you live near by they have to invite you over all
The time. So maybe one conversation setting expectations etc, then stop taking her calls. She can't dictate but it's ok in this instance to reassure her if that's all she needs "
250,"Amen to this. The amount of verbal abuse this guy's heaped on the OP for being -invited to a party he's not paying for- is inexcusable - personally, I'd go as far as telling him he's no longer welcome."
251,Music to my ears!
252,"No, call CPS now. There is absolutely no rational reason to sit on your hands and wait for the next time. Hitting a 4 year old in the face is a big deal and can cause serious harm. "
253,"My wife also suffers from severe anxiety. With regards to the medication, it is often not that simple (Similar to people with severe clinical depression). There are many, many drugs out there that approach the situation from different angles, many combinations of drugs that are tried or used, and many different doses.

Most times, the changes in these medications can be a process that takes months, and they need to be changed very incrementally for the doctor to locate the 'sweet spot' where it all works as intended. And then you have to deal with the body possibly becoming desensitized to that medication, or it causing unwanted and more severe side effects (For instance, my wife's combination of medications that we found, that were actually working, were apparently destroying her liver, so now she has to wait for her liver to recover and start from scratch on finding the right combination of meds, and at a much slower and more conservative pace this time). Many sufferers of anxiety are unable to reliably make doctors visits - if at all. 

Finally, often there is a psychological component to this psychiatric issue, and therapy or counseling is needed to aid the patient in overcoming their anxiety - these things, by their very nature, can easily be emotionally traumatic events that are difficult or impossible at times for the patient to expose themselves to."

257,I actually think his wife is too nice. 3 chances and still lying? I'd be out the door.
258,"Hey, man. 

I'm a pre-Med student myself, and I'll be starting medical school next year. Most people in my family are doctors, and several of my closest friends are in medical school. I don't know your girlfriend, and I don't have all the answers--but I think I can give you some perspective about medical school and the journey that lies ahead.

Here the bottom line: Medical school will be the toughest hurdle you and your girlfriend will ever face. The path to get there was long and arduous--to even be considered, your girlfriend had to have an excellent GPA, a phenomenal MCAT score and plenty of extracurriculars. She had to excel over and over again without thanks just to get her foot in the door. Most people simply aren't intelligent enough or dedicated enough to get accepted to medical school. Your girlfriend did it, and made it look easy; she's obviously quite the catch (but I'm sure you already knew that). 

Here's the truth: the workload will not get any easier as time goes on. She'll have to ace the USLME Step 1 exam, get through the clinical rotations and pass the shelf exams. She'll have to match into a competitive residency in two years. She might have to move out of state--or hell, across the country--for residency. That's absolutely going to put a strain on your relationship, and it's not going to go away.

But people can and do find love in the oddest of places. My parents met, fell in love, and got married in medical school. Twenty-five years later, they're still together. 

The lifestyle isn't for everyone, and the stress will be more than most can handle. But you and your girlfriend can handle that--she's proven it to you right before your eyes. If you want the relationship to work, it can; be there for her in body and in spirit. Don't give up on her, and more importantly, don't let her give up on herself. 

I wish you guys the best of luck. You'll do fine. "
259,the entire thing sounds really immature- on both parts. I'd just dump him and move on to something more stable/adult like. He is probably just going to find other ways to talk to her now that he cant on snapchat.
260,Damn did I write this?? Haha so my life
261,"You could let her look at your internet history and see you have nothing to hide, but honestly it seems like she has some trust issues here that you should definitely deal with. She shouldn't have gotten that angry that quickly. It may have been that she's been betrayed by a partner in the past and it worried that because of your age, you might be more likely to cheat or something. "
262,"You simply can't date people, let alone marry them, for who you wish they could be. She is who she is and she's been that for a while, and she's probably always going to be that same person.  You screwed up by marrying her in a matter of months assuming she'd turn into the person you want, and now you just have to deal with what you have.  

Stop looking to your wife for what she can't provide. Either find a balance where you get things like active lifestyle partners outside of the marriage, or end the marriage to find what you want in one.   "
263,"There's nothing wrong with being on meds for a long time, or forever. If you're not ready to come off them, then staying on is infinitely better than never being treated in the first place.  "

I think you need to apologize."
265,"&gt;would you tell a sick friend not to go get checked for cancer because they might have to do radiation/chemo treatments for a long time in order to get better?

My thoughts exactly. ""I've been reluctant to push him down the DIAGNOSED CANCER route because it took me 3+ years to get off meds for that."""
266,I agree with you. I'm from England and I'm around that age where practically every person I know from uni is getting engaged. You said they are not rich so they might eliminate people they hardly know. Also you two are not married so they might feel like there is no obligation to invite her added to the fact they have only met her once. You have to bear in mind a lot of replies are from different cultures/ age brackets who might do things a lot differently. If you are close enough you could ask for a plus one but if you were that close to begin with they would have already given you one? I don't know I'm shit at giving advice I just wanted to put my two pence in...
267,"&gt; that it's an investment piece 

Your mother is delusional, but ok, she works in the industry, so I guess she has to believe the illusion that gems are that valuable or an investment. I think you should entirely avoid her. Get a cheap ring somewhere else, and do something useful with the money."
268,"It sounds like they are BOTH ignoring the others' needs. He is trying to assert his because she is ignoring them, and in doing so he ignores her needs, and so it cycles. Her getting  the living room every single day in the unwind after work hours isn't a fair compromise; she can make the system more private if she wants it that way. He is being childish and controlling about it, you don't need to convince me of that, but you all have covered his part nicely, so let's cover hers (which I think you're overlooking here). 

If he had a ton of fancy pots and pans and kitchen gadgets to the point that there was no room for his normal ones in the main kitchen storage, would she have the right to say that the use of the kitchen and its tools was more hers than his? Would she be right to tell him the kitchen was exclusively hers during the key after work hours almost every single day? And would ""you get to use this only when I'm done, which is also the time we will spend together tonight so wait around for me till then"" be a fair compromise?

Most apartments only have one main entrrtainment area. She said that when she had roommates it was in her room, and for obvious reasons. If you want to insist that her property =her rules, then they are essentially roommates and she should move the console to an alternate space. 

And you have to dig to find this, but she says it is for hours almost every single weeknight. He is not expressing his needs very well, actuallt he is a damn baby about it, but I think she is definitely disrespecting him. She is giving him the time/space/attention *after she is finished gaming* almost every single day. He has to wait around till that time. And he has to hear her say her console, her rules. He seems to want to game after thry spend That's not a way to build a partnership. Neither is demanding she give it up, but I bet if they can communicate and compromise (meaning that some days a week her gaming in the shared space for 2 hours comes second and boyfriend time comes first) they can work through this. He is probably feeling like she doesn't care if he feels at home and expressing it poorly. She is feeling stifled, and that is getting in the way of her empathizing with him at all."
269,"During a heated an emotional argument, you went to the knife drawer and acted like you were slitting your wrists. You can dress it up in ""oh it was a *joke*"" and ""I was being *goofy*"". No you weren't. "
270,"She said that Sam actually does know her name. Beyond that, it's racist because the fake name he called her was a reference to her racial heritage, not something that sounded like her actual name. It's not racist to blank on your black friend's name and call him Mike instead of Mark; it's racist to intentionally call him DaShaunTreJamelle as a joke."
271,"&gt;Has she been professionally diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety and depression?

My money is on **no**"
272,I'm pretty sure your gf is a prostitute. 
273,"Seriously. If someone is having a bad day you just let them vent and be frustrated. Period or no period, the way he behaved is not acceptable any day of the month. Making fun of someone for being bothered by something that happened to them? That's kind of a crappy way to treat anyone, much less your partner."

275,In the words of the great Iron Maiden.... run to the hiiiiiiiiiiiills.  Six months is supposed to still be the honeymoon stage and he's already guilting and punishing you for daring to have existed before he met you.  This is only going to get worse.
276,"I don't understand why he wouldn't feel comfortable or be honest. It's not like it's a new relationship. We live together, pop each others pimples. He's seen my butthole. I've had those hairy balls in my mouth he can at least give me a reasonable explanation why he shaved them."
277,"Nah, you know what's going on here.

The extreme amount of texting, the look on his face, the feeling in your gut, her neediness, your boyfriend being the only available white knight.

Come on. You know what's going on. You're getting sick over this and he doesn't care. Come on."
278,This is a poor response. 
279,"WOW! Sarah is a jerk! What happens 20 years from now? You have to leave a restaurant because the girls there might be cuter than her???? 

Tell her to get a grip on her sanity. YOU are going to the wedding of your best friend and she can sit in the aisles and DEAL! Why is she being such a whiny baby???"
280,Seriously? Dont us that excuse with her bc sh will see right through it.  You could have proposed anytime at all and set the wedding for the winter.
281,"No, you don't know what you're talking about. It's clear that you are willingly callous and uncaring of what your partner wants from you. "
282,"THANK YOU. I was like, what the hell? FIL is acting like the car was in the grave. Five years old is a great age for a car! "
283,I think you're probably right. I wasn't assertive enough about my decision at the time because I didn't think it needed to be said. I honestly thought we were both on the same page up to 6 months ago.
284,You know more than I do about her. I'm not trying to plant seeds of doubt. I'd just have am issue with someone that can't control themselves when drinking. I get that this might be a one time thing. And its totally work throughable. All the best. Like I said you're the only one that knows all the nuances that creates the relationship. I'm only basing what I said on this one incident.
285,"If you meet at a bar, and then go for coffee together later.... That's called a date. "
286,"Yeah, I feel even worse for her now. I have an Arab mil who is batshit insane so we cut her (and most of his family) off. I got so fucking lucky there. Arabs and Indians really value family, even shitty family, and for the most part you're expected to bow down to your awful elders. I don't know how I would've survived if I had to deal with her. 

OP,  this is his culture. He has an overbearing annoying mom who he will always defer to. He has been taught that mommy is always right and it will be incredibly hard to teach him boundaries. Idk about most Indians, but for my fiancé, he was raised with his religion literally telling him his parents are god-like and cutting off family would send him to hell. Thank fuck he's an atheist now lol. 

I really hope op doesn't alter the tattoo, it'd be incredibly shitty if they broke up. It doesn't seem like her husband has her back at all so this will be par for the course unless she dumps him or somehow convinces him to grow a spine. Which one is more likely :/"
287,"That's a very nice thought, but that isn't a thing. Someone is purposely sending you these."
288,"&gt; She's making terrible choices. She can work, she just chooses not to. She can drive an older car, she just chooses not to. She's making terrible choices, and she hopes that you'll bail her out. If you do it, you will be her servant forever. Don't do it. I know how hard it will be. But I'm telling you, as someone who was just like her, you are hurting more than helping. She needs to fall far, and fall hard, if she's ever going to change.

You're absolutely right. I've always assumed she didn't realize she was choosing to act this way (she's always been scatterbrained), but you're right. She has the choice, and she's chosen to not make things better for herself. Thanks."
289,"I disagree. If you are ambiguous in your responses then you risk another party interpreting your words to suit them. 

I do agree that they both needed to have communicated better. They both should have been more direct."
290,"Hey. This is *her and your brothers baby*, NOT yours or anyone elses. If *they* want privacy after birth then you guys really need to accept that. It sounds like your brother enjoys taking care of his body now and wants to eat healthy and organic. There is nothing wrong with that and to be honest its absolutely none of your business. Stop placing all sorts of weird blame on your SIL and know that you are crossing a line. I can see them cutting you out of their life if your judgment continues, and to be honest I wouldn't blame them


Edit: ALSO GET YOUR SHOTS JESUS. Wtf is wrong with you guys?"
291,You're not doing your kid any favors here this guy sucks.
292,"Is all money gone then? Literally nothing left? I suppose separating finances doesn't help if he already spent all your money. What you should do is get the full control of finances to yourself. He should only have spending account where you put a manageable amount of money for his personal needs. He has addiction and most likely needs professional help to overcome it.


If he doesn't accept you taking over the finances then you should divorce him. Even if he agrees you would do well to think if this is something you can work through."
293,Because daycare is expensive as hell? Give the guy a break. He's clearly trying to solve one problem at a time in what is a seemingly impossible situation.
294,"I'm a bit of an... Overreactor, but my next course of action would be to notify him that if he doesn't return your property by time/date, you'll be filing a police report on your *stolen* camera. I'd also point out that at 850USD, theft of that particular camera is a felony in most US states. 

Then I'd email his mum."
295,"First of all, overbite is a jaw alignment issue, not a lack of chin issue. it's fixed with braces and possibly maxillofacial surgery. a chin lift can be done at the same time as the jaw surgery, as well as a nosejob (I'll be getting a nosejob but not a chin lift as I already have a strong chin) 

second, boobs resume growing until you're 25 so I'd wait until then to get it done. most of my boobs grew around 21. I'm 24 now and they're still growing "
296,waaaaaaaaaaay different than OP's situation 
297,"&gt;It sucks, and to be honest, I'm a ""you-messed-up-you-take-responsibility,"" guy; but I just want to inform the OP that should she go through with this behind his back, she'll have to basically live with ruining a person's career and possibly life.

I think your comment is good information and well taken, but I think the thrust of this particular statement is a little unfair. If anyone is responsible for ruining her husband's career/life, it's going to be the guy who blew his family's savings on Twitch streamers, not the stay-at-home wife who's trying to make rent and stay afloat."
298,"Hahahaha. I might try *Oz.* Technically OP's husband can't complain since they're all in prison already, right?"
299,"Check out /r/justnomil and possibly a sub like /r/raisedbynarcissists 

You grew up watching your father abuse your mother. Your mother is putting her emotional well being on your shoulders. That's a toxic mess and  you may end up needing therapy to unpack everything and let go of the guilt.

Move out. Consider offering your mom resources to escape DV, but make sure to keep firm boundaries for the process."
300,"No, they're being realistic. "
301,"You have to tell him. 

Your friendship is going to be damaged either way.

Telling him is the best way forward. Then you can move on. If you don't tell him, you will not move on, and you will not ever date. "
302,The fuck did I just read
303,"&gt; He uprooted his life and made sacrifices for your education only for you to continue working in your current field

For the time being. It's not like she can't get a job in that field in a couple years or if they decide to move elsewhere. It's been beneficial to him as well. She even said he encouraged this.

&gt;I'm also questioning what excluding him from the celebrations will achieve in your relationship.

It's right there written in plain English that he's the one excluding himself. He said she should just celebrate with her family instead. He said it's stupid. He said the words ""I don't want to celebrate your graduation."" I just can't see why you're trying to put the blame on OP.
"
304,"Why not just say that seeing him with Amy is making you feel insecure and ridiculous?

Seriously, you've been responding to everyone with ""how do I say this without sounding jealous/crazy/needy"" but that's *exactly* how you're *feeling*. Why be afraid of sounding that way? Are you not at a stage in your relationship where you can trust your boyfriend with your feelings?

Everyone is saying this is a boundaries issue, like your boyfriend shouldn't be letting her take photos with him like that. However, boundaries are only ever established with communication. *Communicate with him*."
305,Let alone invite her for coffee.  coffee?  really?
306,"Honestly, I think the best comparison is weight. Women draw so much insecurity from their figure. It's the same with men and their junk-- especially if they're younger."
307,"Do you think he cares? If someone did what you did to him to me, ""sorry"" would just reopen old wounds and piss me off even more. This is completely for your own gain, don't pretend like you care about what is good for him. "
308,"Either oral is sex, or ~~all~~ many lesbians are permanent virgins."
309,but the baby is *soooo cute* in stripes! *Who's* mommies little felon?
310,"You said she won't go with you to exercise, do you feel that takes you off the hook? No. It's unfortunate that it's harder for you than for her, but that doesn't absolve you from responsibility for yourself. If you need some structure, why not join a weight loss program and hire a trainer. I think that would be a big step in the right direction. Good luck, I know it's hard. But you can do it, if you decide to. You have to want to do it for yourself."
311,"This is terrible advice. Telling someone that their opinions and happiness doesn't matter because they contribute less financially is definitely a relationship killer. My way or the highway is a terrible plan if you want a relationship to last. 

Maybe a better way, or less offensive way, to say the same thing is to ask what she would be able to contribute to increasing the budget would be more productive. "
312,"She drove to his house to fuck him. Hilarious that people think and say this ""evil"" man took advantage of this poor woman

She is an A-grade asshole and cheater, do not stay with her op.



She fucked him is HIS bed, for fucks sake this makes me boil with angry."
313,"Not to mention that now when he sees those women, he's sees as sexual objects to jerk off too, not people. "
314,"1. Your nuclear option might backfire and just make Helga act more abusively towards your friend. 

2. I don't know if that's your responsibility, or something that James would thank you for in the end. "
315,I'm talking about the people who receive handouts for their whole lives i.e. your boyfriend. He views his parents as a piggy bank and now he views you as one too. Idk I guess it's his parent's fault but idk how you can have a successful partnership with a man who wants you to take care of him and pay for him like his mommy.
316,[removed]
317,"Maybe it is some sort of imagined weird rivalry with your mom's affair partner(s) where he feels compelled to buy their love. 

What was your relationship like with your father, compared to your siblings' relationships with him, before the divorce? What are your siblings' ages?

Is ther any chance that your father didn't want another child when they had you? Were you the baby that was supposed to keep the marriage together? Are you very much like your mother and your siblings are not? 

There could be any number of ""reasons"", not that any are really acceptable though. I'm sorry it sucks so much. "
318,"Lonely, sexually frustrated, and refuses to have sex with you because she wants to wait until marriage... so she goes and has sex with her friend and waits a week to tell you?

Dude... there's no way you should be forgiving this. The relationship is over. "
319,"He's already making the situation about himself. I don't think she's going to make any headway with him talking about her own needs.

I figure if he wants the focus on himself he can have it, but he's going to have to explain why he wants to be treated like a child at his age. "
320,"This situation with OP's boyfriend is all kinds of messed up. I thought at first that he was just worried about her overall well-being and didn't want her to be taken advantage of. Instead, he's pissy that she won't let him also take advantage of her...?? TF?"
321,"Your wife and kid are in danger, and you're worried about the money? Have you even looked at current values in your area? If you've fixed stuff up and the area has become an 'up and coming' place you're nuts to try and force your wife to stay."
322,Yikes. He's definitely making you feel like you're temporary. You won't be in any of his pictures with family during his function or in his acknowledgments so your existence can be wiped clean whenever he wants. 
323,"I feel like I've been overly dickish in my response, so I wanna say, in the interest of even-handedness, I enjoy staying inside in my free time, I'm not out doing exciting things with my SO all the time. BUT for him to say he's too ""intellectual"" to go out with OP, and needs hobbies with ""goals,"" when he's just talking about gaming, annoys me... so... so much. More than it should. I don't even know why. "
324,"I was about to type, I think you meant to type ex-fiance until I read your story. She might be crazy (doubt it) or this might be one of those rare stories where your fiance is living a double life. First thing you need to do is remain calm and collected while you do some more investigating. Try to gather facts before so you're well prepared when you confront him. Might want to also start looking at other places to live. Good luck."
325,Great suggestions! She declines without being rude and puts her into place - love this!
326,"I want to start this by saying that OP should most certainly go to HR (preferably after communicating with the co-worker as well).

But the end of your post... This is simply not true, unfortunately. It isn't a matter of opinion, it's a matter of reality and personal experience. Like the other poster said, YOU'RE probably great, but YOU don't represent anything. Just like 'bad cops' don't represent the people working in law enforcement that are actually around to serve and protect, not power trip. It works vice versa.


I've PERSONALLY had more awful experiences with HR Departments (all over my country, btw) than good, making the pleasant experiences the exception.
Just because somebody's job is to help you, it doesn't mean they are going to do their job right. You see that in real life a lot. 

"
327,Honestly it's probably just that it's bare and undecorated. Almost all guys in their early twenties that I know have rooms/houses that look like this to some extent. Some of them were really clean and tidy but the lack of posters or personal touches/patterns just made the whole place scream 'grotty rented accommodation for students.' You can be the cleanest person in the world but bare walls and carpets in student-type apartments are always going to look grubby and uninviting. 
328,"Its nice to think that, but given he was married and carried on an affair(possibly knowing your own family history), he manipulated you right where he wants you. Hell he's STILL lying as evidenced by the fact his ex is willing(rightly or wrongly) to meet you right now when things are still up in the air. 

You have been played. Despite the truth, you still have stars in your eyes and he knows it. 

IF he were the great lover and future husband and father you have made him out to be, he'd have moved into his own place and settled his affairs, FIRST. Instead he's chosen to lay up on you and take advantage.

High stress situations can change people, but they can also reveal what is at someone's core.

329,We both figured it's time to stop making excuses and just figure it out as we go.  And oh man was it ever!
330,"&gt; I hadn't thought about confronting Andy myself, seems a tad territorial at first. But I really might end up doing it.

Hmmm, I would suggest against doing this.  Your problem is with Joanna, not Andy.  She is the one ""who doesn't have boundaries"".  She is the one inviting Andy into the apartment, and out for carrot cake.  She is prioritising his feelings:

&gt;When I said that I'm still hurt, she said that she hopes I don't ask her to get rid off Andy all together because he's really insecure and it would hurt him terribly. That to me sounded like she just values his feelings more than mine, when I told her that she just pleaded with me to not be insecure and that while Andy might be a dear friend, he's not nearly as important to her as I am.

Yeah, it sounds to me like she really puts him before you.  Think about it, if she cared about your feelings, she would acknowledge your feelings and possibly offer some compromise, e.g. not inviting the guy around all the time... 

The other thing that is jumping out at me is Lily, she's doing you a solid favour by letting you know that something is up.

Look at what she's telling you:

&gt;Lilly had already approached Joanna before she came to me and was rebuffed, she only turned to me because she is moving back to her place on Sunday since her boyfriend will be back from his trip and **she hasn't been liking what she has been seeing**. 

She is so pissed off with your GF activity that she is reaching out to you, and she is moving out of the flat because she is unhappy with Andy and he **weirds her out**. 

What is Lily not teling you out of delicacy, and what is Joanna not telling you at all??

I'm sorry, if I were you I would be very unhappy about this.   Ask Joanna to ensure that she does not have Andy sleepover.  See how she reacts to that request...  See who's feelings she puts first."
331,"Animals should never be given as gifts. Lesson learned that your mom shouldnt have animals in the first place. Is your mom getting treatment for he mental health?

335,"He tried to puppy train you?!?! And you're still with him?! Maybe on top of the questions about the sweat you should seek out a referral to a therapist of some sort. If you'd put up with that, I can't imagine you have the healthiest self image as a result of whatever this sweat thing is. That might be one of the rudest things I've ever heard on here. Certainly not the worst, but INCREDIBLY rude."
336,"Admiration for someone else is ""bragging"" now? Wow. 

If the brother and other people like him are demanding the world to walk on eggshells around them and their sensitivities, then maybe they should take a good hard look at themselves and figure out how to actually survive. Because being that defensive, and twisting someone else's words, is just insane.

&gt; Maybe you should've known how your own brother would react.
&gt; Hes your brother so you would know how he is

That can be said for the brother as well, you know. OP is his brother, he should have known that OP was in no way ""bragging"" or ""comparing"" or ""demeaning"" or ""insulting"" him. 
"
337,"you made sure of it too, you know.

calling this 'one mistake' and saying he chased you is your way of trying to pretend this was something that happened to you. the fact is you made it happen. it doesn't sound like this is going to be the last time this will happen. i would say that you need to tell your husband, but it's pretty obvious that you're not going to do that. i don't even know why you made this post. did you just want to share the news you got pounded so hard &amp; well? congratulations. you are now a cheater."
338,"Dude, come on.  She's playing you and stringing you along to fill her need for attention.  She has ZERO intention of ever being your girlfriend.  Have some self respect and move on."

344,This is exactly correct. They should not be volunteering your bed for the new people. The new groups could get another house near by.
345,"&gt; I can't just leave her now; she's this way because of me. She's relied on me for so long and now I have to fix her.

Yes you can; no she isn't. No you don't. 

I take you are not identical. Something happened in the womb, the birth, the genetic make up that screwed her up and left you as a relatively normal if somewhat submissive person. 

She is a cancer in your life and you need to excise it. I know it is difficult with a close family member but I would go NC for a time. See her at Christmas and Thanksgiving. Apart from that be selfish and let her screw someone else's life up instead of yours. Your husband must have the patience of a saint to have put up with this.

[Edit: I just reviewed the rest of the postings on this and there is an almost unique agreement on this. Everyone is giving you the same analysis and the same advice. Maybe Reddit isn't the best place to go for advice but when everyone is saying the same thing you need to listen.]"
346,"That doesn't surprise me, since your parents have always avoided confrontation with her even as a child. Now they have an adult brat on their hands. It's up to them to lay down boundaries with her if they aren't happy about this, but you should stay out of it. It's their problem to solve, not yours. "
347,"Block her immediately, then at least she won't be inclined to speak to you at the ball.  

Never never never ever cover for someone who isn't pulling their own weight and then expect their anger to be ignored for being called out. 

You've worked hard , you deserve to have the rewards of hard work do not allow her to who glomming on to the benefits of your labor.  

Just tell your group of friends that actually no you would rather she did not attend."

349,This is the best idea I've seen suggested. By letting the whole friend group know that *something* is off with Zach it gives her a lot more credibility than just keeping it bottled up.
350,What a way to spend what should be a fun happy night - ignoring snide comments. Being the better person. Fuck no. Op needs to knock it on the head before the evening. She needs to somehow communicate that she doesn't want anything to do with her. 
351,Maybe. It does make me feel better that she isn't like super successful and awesome and stuff. I have no problem admitting that would be hard for me.
352,"Having children is the ultimate sacrifice. You give up so much that makes you you for them. Your money, your time, your energy. Goals change, paths switch, priorities recalibrate. 

Her body changing is a real fear. It happens. It will be one of MANY things that will change. 

Before you take the plunge weigh all the options. Decide it it's worth the sacrifices. "
353,"Have you talked with him about all this? And it wouldn't be weird at all to find a place for just the two of you, especially as you'll be living together for the first time. I'd tell your bf sooner rather than later though, so you can try to sort it out together. 


Or if the roommate really needs to come, try to find a fourth person maybe. If your bf still wants his roommate to come and doesn't want to change, I wouldn't go live with that if I were you. You have all very reasonable reasons and the roommate will probably get resentive of you because you 'take his friend (time) away' if your bf tries to prioritize you."
354,"&gt;It would be a betrayal of who we are as a family.

Ah, yes. This is often the problem with folks who try to out-nice a problem like addiction or narcissism. Your hearts are in the right place, but you are setting yourselves on fire to keep someone else warm - and that person is deliberately turning up the air conditioning trying to make themselves colder. Trying to set yourself *even more on fire* is not the solution here. It's to let them freeze, and change their mind about making themselves colder. They have to make this decision.

&gt;who we are

Who your family is right now is a family of enablers, ruining your lives and finances to fuel his irresponsibility. He will not stop doing this until you stop giving him money or else run out of money to give. 

Either way he'll hit a point where he has nowhere to turn and will have to face the reality he's brought upon himself. At absolute rock bottom, he has a chance to turn his life around.

The only choice your family has is whether you're right down there at rock bottom with him when this happens, due to allowing him to burn through your money as well to delay the inevitable for a while longer, or whether you're still living your own healthy lives and so are able to help him (NOT give him more money, but offer help with strict boundaries and conditions to avoid a relapse in behaviour).

Honestly, the sooner he runs out of options the better - not only because you will be there and able to *actually* help (not enable) when he wants help and wants to change, but because he has more of his life ahead of him if he hits this stage early. 

If you pour your finances into allowing him to get away with being irresponsible and burn through money like it's coal on a fire, then all you'll do (besides ruining your family) is make it so that it's much harder for him to recover from this when he finally does decide to recover - he'll be older, have racked up more debts, have only a bankrupt family who hates him, and possibly a criminal record at this rate."

357,"Are you still seeing that therapist? If so, they'd be the best person to discuss this with."
358,"I feel like this one doesn't really need to be explained. OP listed a whole bunch of things that Tony has done, *any one of which* would be reasonable grounds for cutting someone out without any questions asked. If Tony needs to ask why, Tony is dumber than he sounds."
359,"I would make sure to mention that you got the virus (HSV-1) that causes most cold sores on peoples lips and that you have had 2 outbreaks of that on your genitals. As it prefers the oral region, it's very inactive on the genitals which leads to less symptoms and to much lower transmission risk. Herpes researcher over at the Westover heights clinic has even said that she has never seen a confirmed case of genital to genital hsv-1 transmission. She says that its almost exclusively transmitted by orally to genitals. That's just her word though so keep that in mind. 

If you were to have another outbreak (most people only get 1-3 in their lifetime) and you have sex while it's active then surely the risk of transmission must be high.


You're early mid 20's, somewhere around  40-50% of people your age carry this virus. Most without symptoms so there is a 30-35% chance that she already carries this virus even if she never had an outbreak.



You do not have the traditional genital herpes caused by HSV-2. I don't mean to throw those with HSV-2 under the bus. think the HSV-2 stigma is way overblown and I wouldn't have an issue dating someone with HSV-2 and go condomless if I saw a future with that person. But the facts are still that genital hsv-1 is not the same as genital hsv-2."
360,"Girl no, this is the real him. Now he thinks he has you locked down, I mean, you aren't even willing to leave him! So yeah, now he can be who he really is, since you're stuck with him. You need to leave. Well actually, you stay in your apartment and have his ass leave. I say this as someone that's known people that have been in similar situations. You will not be happy."

362,"Deflecting. I have gotten pretty good at it while working with small children. It works on adults as well. What you want to do is change the conversation pretty quickly to another similar topic, to make it seem like a seamless natural flow. 

Boss: SkinColor, I went to [Ethnic Place] for dinner and had [obscur dish] do you know what it is? 

You: I'm not sure. I have never really tried [Ethnic Place] is it good? I went to [Italian Place] on [Road] last night. They have amazing food. Do you know anywhere else that has good Italian, my boyfriend loves it...

Every time she does that, change the topic. 

You can also start asking her questions about her own heritage, as people like sharing things about themselves [to a point, not excessively like she does to you.] "
363,"Oh boy do you need to get down on your knees and grovel. You left your kid unsupervised in a room with dangerous stairs to take a call on your office phone. I hope that call brought you enough business to compensate for the pain and trauma of your son breaking his leg. (sarcasm)

I don't think that it is just your wife who has a clash of parenting styles with you. I expect 99% of the population does. You need to ask yourself are YOU fit to be a parent. 
 
Supervised climbing of stairs is an excellent learning exercise for a toddler. Unsupervised it can be deadly. A decent parent would have had child-proof gates on those stairs, top and bottom and from a time before they were needed. And Mrs Wifey doesn't get away Scot-free on this one.

You are a self-centered piece of work. "
364,"That's not how bots work. I haven't heard of any ransomware that functioned like that I suppose it's plausible but the idea is quick money. Lock down the marks data, maybe data mine for something embarrassing and ask for payment. that not what happened here and unless those screenshots happened to be on the computer somewhere they would have had to install ransomware on you, go hunting for your husband, somehow deploy a hack on his phone, and then pull texts from 6 years ago. Again this is about quick money thats weeks worth of effort for what kind of pay off. Someone sent those to you directly not a hack. "
365,I definitely don't subscribe to the belief that Crossfit is the only way. I may suggest a personal trainer. I did use to go to the class before him but our work schedules only allow us to spend a couple hours a day together. He likes to be at the gym with me....but....I may just go early to avoid all the whining.
366,"Oh god, this is so hard. I want to take your side because I understand how upsetting that can be and just how foul cat piss can smell. 

But I have to tell you the truth, I'd never forgive my girlfriend for making me get rid of a pet. Even if I wanted to more than anything in the world. From my perspective, getting a pet is a solemn responsibility. That pet didn't ask to live with you or get attached to you - you facilitated that and as such, you have a responsibility to them. That's just my perspective though. "
367,"Unless Irene is just not a good parent or a person you can trust, I think you made the wrong decision. "
368,"While this is good advice, if OP is trying to save money, I think a camera will cost her more than just using a dryer. "
369,"Literally his words were ""it's like living with a puppy"". He even went as far as force me to feel the stain to make a point that it's unacceptable :( 

I feel horrible. Just been laying here staring at the ceiling wondering how I'm gonna get over it or if I even will or should. 

I can't even have a conversation with him about it tomorrow because we have plans with friends all day and then he has to study, so I know for sure he'll probably refuse to talk it out with me. "
370,"A 3 bed 2 bath 2000 sq ft home is plenty of space for a family of 4. I agree with the other poster that suggested getting rid of some stuff. Go through all your rooms and have a garage sale before the baby is born. Decluttering can have an amazing effect. 

I don't think building a new home when you're just starting a new job is a good idea at all. Sounds like you've got a good head on your shoulders but managing your wife's expectations could prove challenging. You shouldn't dig yourself into a hole just because she wants the best of everything. Live within your means. "
371,If your wife insists it might be better to ask for special accommodation to avoid potential drama.
372,You seem like an amazing kid.   All the best to you.    Life does get easier as you get older and have more control over situations.   I seem from experience.   Hang in there.
373,she said she'd be laying lower rent...so I'm gonna say yes
374,"The abused deserves/needs a safe space free from the abuser's influence. Therapists can't control what happens at home. Therapists aren't able to moderate things that happen once the session is over. They may be aware of the risk, but they have very limited means of preventing the abuser from using it to later harm the abused. The abused will be very reluctant to criticise the abuser in front of someone else, even mildly, knowing they'll pay for it later. Sophisticated abusers may even act supportive and open to feedback in front of the therapist, then convince the abused that their problems are now solved before escalating."
375,"So, you feel like your husband was not there to protect you. After the fact he is doing nothing to prevent something like this in the future. The is the crux of your issue. You were violated and your husband is doing nothing about it. How are you supposed to trust him to be there for you in the future?

In other words, your husband needs to ""defend your honor.""

The truth is that you 96 year old great grandpa is not going to change, nor is he going to apologize.

The problem is everyone else around him, including your husband, who did nothing. They knew this was a possibility, but did nothing to protect the young bride.

---

So, you need to confront your husband about all of this. You need to let him know how painful it was. He needs to make you feel like this will never happen again. Not because he is going to tell off his grandpa, but because we will protect you from this vile old man in the future.

He will create whatever buffer is necessary. If somehow, great grandpa gets past the defenses and cops a feel, your hubby better be there to slap the shit out of that hand.

---

If hubby does not get this, strongly consider packing your bags, flying home and requesting an annulment."
376,ugh-dont waste another day of your time with him.  You know you are not going marry a guy with an attitude like that so why continue dating him?
377,It won't make you look like a shitty partner. Not when he's **actually** being a shitty partner. 
378,"Wow, you told this teenager that her body isn't attractive to you and that she's too skinny? What is wrong with you?"

380,"Shockingly, your 22 year old girlfriend is not a fan of you telling other 22 year old women that you love them.  

I'm giving you all the benefit of the doubt and assuming it was 100% platonic on both sides. Still. Not a great thing to send in Snapchat."
381,"Because an honest person would just tell you he need some time to himself, if he isn't being honest about smaller things like that you will question everything wondering if he is telling the truth or not. "
382,"So from the sound of it this is going to be permanent. All her gross habits aside, have you talked about an end date or is this just now she's here and it's for good type of deal? 

Her hygiene habits alone would make me not want her in my house, never mind she's classless and should be picking up after herself. All of that though is fuel for the fire since you sound like you resent her being there, as anyone would.

You need to talk with your husband about the future. Does she bother him? While it's not her house she should be respectful of it and cleaning up after herself. Is there an end date for when she moves to another brothers house? She also shouldn't be butting her nose into the topic of children and boundaries should be set, but all of this is on your husband as it's his mother. "
383,"You just made me realize.... if OP tips off the police, she STILL won't even come close to betraying him the way he betrayed her.  
  
He tried to pin a crime on her.  
  
She wants to turn him in for a crime he actually did."
384,"It seems like your partner is siding with his sister and it's unfair to you to be treated like you're being unreasonable. I have the feeling that your partner is used to yielding to his sister because she's older and she behaves unreasonably.

I'd tell him he's kicking her out or you are. I would be prepared to play this by the book, too. She's tenant at this point. If she's sneaky enough to tell people she's living there indefinitely and going back on your original agreement, I wouldn't trust her to make it easy on you."
385,"I think it's a type of narcissism. Young kids and babies are essentially an extension of 'you'. As they get older, they start to have personalities, thoughts and willpower of their own, and narcissists actually resent that. I think the grandmother in this post was being really passive aggressive by leaving the birthday gift and felt justified cutting off OP, because she had the audacity to grow up and not be narcissistic supply any longer. She probably sees new grandchildren as a new source of narcissistic supply.

Obviously total conjecture, but it would make sense, given the history. OP could try to see her one-on-one and see how much she freaks out over not having access to the baby, and use that to judge. If grandma is excited to reconnect with OP, that's good, but if she starts getting angry at lack of access, there's your answer."
386,Glad to hear the good news! I'm glad everything worked out! :)
387,"Not sure why your comment turned me on, but I feel like I'm going to lick my boyfriends arm just to see if he responds this way"
388,"Can confirm, the peas mention is an integral part of the interaction. I suggest you take your mom out to get your nails done for this conversation. "
389,"It's your 21st! That's a birthday most people look forward to. 
You've given him chances. You've told him it bothers you. You're way too young to  be with someone who can't at least celebrate your birthday. You deserve someone who makes a big deal out of you and your day. You deserve so much happiness. You're only 21! Drop him, get your friends together, and have your birthday! 
You know how many guys there are out there? How many years you have ahead of you? "
390,"What I meant by that was aversions and cravings. I used to hate yogurt before I got pregnant, now I can't get enough of it. I loved coffee before, now I can't stand the smell of it. "
391,"&gt; See how I'm stuck in a rock and a hard place?

Unfortunately, your husband is the rock. And also the hard place.   You shouldn't have to be terrified that someone will even THINK you looked at a man.  This is not normal. You are not being respected or trusted. Your partner sounds overly suspicious of you, while you sound incredible submissive.  Can you speak to a therapist or a counsellor for some guidance? Non-religious would probably be  best, as your ""hypothetical religion"" sounds prohibitive."
392,"You called your pregnant wife chubby when the first rule of pregnancy is to never discuss weight gain. The only exception is if the doctor thinks she is at an unhealthy weight. She is raging with hormones and her body is changing everyday and you discussed her weight behind her back.

Of course you apologize. "
393,"As others have said she's simply being your fan, just like anyone else can be on the Internet. The only one that sticks out though is reddit, since reddit is an anonymous type social media. You normally have more privacy here. But Facebook and YouTube, assuming you have your face on them has zero expectation of privacy."
394,"Seems like the bigger question here, or at least the one closer to home, is why are you still friends with this guy? I recommend that you deal with that issue first, and then decide later about leaving the anonymous tip. "
395,"FWIW, I'm not a social worker, but my understanding is that *most* CPS's try to avoid taking kids.  There's a lack of foster homes, so I think good social workers will try to work with the family to help solve the problems first.  What your sister is going through is not great, but it sounds like it could be solved with a bit of support if your mom is cooperative.  

I think your vision of a social worker coming in, grabbing your sister, and you never see her again is reserved for situations where the child is at risk of imminent harm or has already suffered physical or sexual abuse."
396,"This! My husband and I have an 8 year age difference. We started dating when I was 26 and he was 34. We were both established in our jobs, mature, responsible, what have you. Not a problem.

But consider if I'd met him say 8 years earlier--if I'd been 18 and he'd been 26. *Then* it would have been a problem, because it would have been a situation of someone with much more life experience pursuing someone with very little. 

As you get older, age difference becomes less of an issue. It's not the number that's the problem, but the amount of life experience one has to build a foundation on. "
397,"Your sister sounds EXACTLY like mine. Try doing some googling on ""Histrionic Personality Disorder""."
398,"What's interesting is that our therapist (who has treated him for many years) basically says that he is about ten years behind emotionally than his actual age. That would put him at about a 25 year old's level, the exact age of the woman he was working with. When he talks about what they had in common they sounds like the concerns and interests of two very very young people.  
You've really hit on something, I think, in that I've often longed for the time when he would grow up and be an equal partner in our relationship. Not just in a financial sense (that's a whole other gripe all together) but in the sense that he has his OWN dynamic life outside of the relationship just like I do.

I am an incredibly driven person and I dont need to be with someone just like me with lots of friends and work projects. I just want someone who brings something of their own to the table and isn't just using my life to bolster theirs "
399,"&gt; When I take our baby for swimming lessons Saturday morning she doesn't want to come because she has body issues and wants the alone time (fair enough). She doesn't like coming for a coffee either but we do do the occasional weekend brunch which is nice.

She could come and just sit on the side watching and interacting from there.  She could go for coffee.  She sounds like she doesn't WANT to be involved.

Talk to her about scheduling a REGULAR date night for you two (once every week or two if possible), and a regular family day (or at least a few hours) on the weekend.  Go to a park, the zoo, etc. ANYTHING.  "

401,"I agree; I was expecting to disagree with the OP but I don't, actually. It's both the frequency and the nature of the trips - he's not only leaving OP behind, he's leaving his kids behind during a time when they should be having family outings (summer vacation). Two seems fine, but three is a bit much. On average, one per month, this guy leaves his wife home with the kids...just feels wrong."

The petty part of me, however, wants you to use red tape to mark out his half and your half of the house. Actually, since you're contributing way more financially, take 3/4 of it for yourself. Move all his stuff to that side of the house. And then tell him it's over."
404,While you have a decent job is a *perfect* time to begin looking for a new job! You won't have as much fear of rejection because you can fall back on your current job and you'll be motivated by self-improvement and not resentment/frustration.
405,"She says it's more about friend ships and the other women in our community not making an effort with her. She doesn't seem to be threatened, she has nothing to worry about."
406,"Since I read OPs comment above, I think her concerns are valid. Cuddling with female friends an having a long emotional affair with a female friend are definitely things that damage trust in a relationship and Op is not wrong in not trusting her BF won't cheat when spending a lot of time alone with female friends."

408,The salt has a 'curing' effect that along with the smoke/drying makes the meat completely safe. You have probably eaten things at restaurants that are more hazardous and not even known it. 
409,"Therapy sounds like a great idea.

I don't have much to say other than the fact that there are lots of overweight people out there doing just fine. It sounds like you have some goals, and even a cool little internship. That is stuff to be proud of and keep working toward.

Your success won't come all at once, but making teeny tiny improvements will make your life a lot better in the long run. So just try to focus on doing a little bit more each day, and don't be too hard on yourself when you have an off day."
410,"Have you talked to your wife about it? This could be really fraught for her, but I think she deserves to know and have input on how to deal. 

My other thought is that consequences for kids always need to natural consequences of their actions. The first is that he needs to be held accountable for his statements- by you and your wife. He needs to see and understand how these words hurt people. It's natural for teenagers to say more than they mean, and to seek private places to express their feelings, so you need to reinforce that the problem is that he's hurting people instead of finding better ways to deal with his feelings. Kids have anger about things- you need to figure out why and how to productively deal with it. 

The second consequence needs to be some time away from the internet. "
411,"You can't just expect her to give up her cat that predates you by more than a decade. That's neither fair nor reasonable. You knew she had the cat early in the relationship I'm assuming. Hate to say it, but suck it up or break up."
412,"I'm sure he'll know whats up, but I don't think there's a discreet way to necessarily make time to talk specifically without giving it away more or less. And, I guess the question is, is it better to let him walk into the situation totally clueless just to be blindsided with a breakup? I totally get what you're saying about knowing your in deep shit, but I think I'd rather have that time to prepare myself than walk into a situation where I think we're hanging out normally just to be hit with a breakup. But obviously everybody is different."
413,"Does he?

How long has he been unemployed? You don't mention that. And that'll be a pretty good indicator of his attitude. "

415,My friend cries when he hears music he loves (new and old)! I've never heard of this before he told me. Is there ever situations where this has embarrassed you?
416,"Given her past abuse she is probably having confusing illogical reactions that she's not in good control of. She could probably benefit from therapy (especially CBT). Possibly, even though she likely knows it's crazy, her ex convinced her that his controlling behaviour was how she is supposed to know he loves her. I've been in an abusive relationship and I didn't have this particular problem, but for the first year afterwards, I do think I behaved much more erratically than my normal personality and perhaps was (totally subconsciously) testing to see if other people would flip out the way my ex would. I'd honestly break down in anxious, uncomfortable tears if someone was kind to me when I had made a mistake (e.g. lost an object they owned that was worth $20) because one of the main feature of my abusive relationship was that somehow everything was blamed on me (the traffic, the weather) and I was made to feel genuinely guilty - god fucking forbid I ACTUALLY did something wrong. Like, when I say I cried because people were kind, to be clear these were not happy grateful tears, I felt FUCKING AWFUL and I had no logical reason, there was NOTHING I could say to answer ""why"" (besides the obvious connection to my abusive ex - but nothing in the moment I mean). My point: she may be having strong negative feelings and may not understand why and is lashing out / pressing buttons / communicating poorly due to extreme insecurity.

**My immediate advice:** Ask to talk to her in person, start by reassuring her and emphasizing your feelings are hurt and you are confused, and then ask her why what you said made her feel so bad.

**My advice beyond that:** Watch for this being a pattern of behaviour. If she seems to settle down over time it may just be maladaptive coping mechanisms like I suggest, especially if she is receptive to talking through the communication mishaps and actively works on it. If she never settles down and you are always on eggshells, you're in for a rough time and should re-evaluate whether the highs are worth the lows and if the relationship is healthy."
417,"Two things here. First, he got you to feel bad about the fact that he was flirting with other women, a big red flag. Second, he's an ungrateful ass. My girlfriend has never bought me flowers, but if she did it would make my day. Nobody has ever done that for me and it is really thoughtful. I think you should go find a man that appreciates your thoughtfulness instead of mocking you for it. "
418,"There was a recent thread series in personal finance along similar lines where a guy got a promotion at a nonprofit. I think he ended up with a 25% raise after negotiating, and it was still considered pretty fucking hefty. So negotiate, but your focus should be on the next job."
419,"Just a wild card suggestion - I would ramp it up and actually start hitting on Lars. Since lina is persecuting you as if you are actually hitting on him, why not make her dreams a reality and go for it? Nothing is going to piss her off more than you actually going after Lars. 

I would still talk to your manager and let her/him know that lina is harassing you at work and see if you can get her banned from the club. Maybe throw in that she's harassing customers as well. If lina gets banned from the club you're basically free to hit on Lars and piss her off and there's nothing to do about it. 

*This is more of a wild card suggestion if you want to fight fire with fire. If you want to take the high road, this advice is definitely not the way to go. "
420,"Very often this kind of criticism means that there is something the partner feels guilty about.  Has he shown any behavior such as working longer hours or being possessive of his phone.

423,"I think people here are freaking out a bit. The comment was gross and out of line, but he specifically said ***if she was older***. I've looked at toddlers and thought ""I bet he grows up handsome"" - doesn't make me a pedophile. Based on his past tendencies to say dumb shit without thinking I think that letting him off with a ""that's disgusting, don't say shit like that"" is fine.

I mean, the dude is 20 - is it so weird that he'd find an attractive 18 year old (15 + ""a bit older"") attractive?"
424,"&gt;She told them about what happened, but then said she made the conscience decision to be better and choose happier ways to deal with things. Her therapist was happy to hear that

What the fuck"
425,"It's normal.

If you are overwhelmed with it though and see nothing good in what you have, change it.  If this is just another thought, but you see nothing but good in what you have, then don't change it.

The grass is greener where you water it.


"
426,"I don't think there is any point in apologizing to him. Obviously you are feeling very guilty about what you've done, and trying to reach out to him and say sorry would only be done in with your selfish interest in mind. He probably never wants to hear from you again, and there's no way that a simple apology could take back all the events that you caused. Leave him alone, get some therapy for your behavior."
427,"I think you are over analyzing this. My girlfriend was completely disgusted by him, especially considering he tried to kiss her while I was there and we were in front of everyone. As far as him apologizing, no he did not. He blamed me and said I overreacted. "
428,"I can't include the link here, but the ""Personal Space"" commercial on *Rick and Morty* sums up my feelings on this kind of approach in a school/work setting or a place I can't immediately leave (like public transit). It's basically 100% unwelcome and it makes me dislike the person for putting me in an awkward position. That said, it's an OK approach for an inherently social setting (like a party), as long as you accept ""no"" gracefully.

I'd agree with the online dating suggestion many have made. It's just so much easier."

433,It means that she got into the relationship too young and let it shape too much of her personality and decisions.  It sounds like you think there is nothing else there- what you see is what she's got.  She disagrees.
434,"You could start with figuring out why your girlfriend expressing her thoughts and feelings is deemed ""unnecessary"" by you. That's really awful and disrespectful. Why don't you care if she's happy? Why do you think she's being irrational? If she feels you're not spending enough quality time with her or otherwise is feeling unhappy in your relationship, those are *legitimate* feelings and you should be trying to figure out what you can do *together* so you're both happy. Honestly I hope she leaves you for her sake."
435,Only allowing certain types of interaction is still control.  
436,"&gt; When I asked if they were poly-amorous, he said no

Look, I prefer the term ""ethical nonmonogamy"" to polyamory, but the fact that he has said, ""I totally want to have sex with you, no, my wife and I aren't poly,"" sounds weird. 

&gt; it's just bugging me because he told me not to tell anyone about his 'open relationship.' 

Yeah, this guy is full of shit.

I would drop a polite line to the wife, if you have her number. ""Hey Susie, it's Nancy, Jim's friend. He told me that you are happy for him to pursue other women and I wanted to touch base with you to confirm this is correct."" 

If you don't have her number, ask the guy. If he refuses, then you know he's scoping out a mistress. There is honestly no good reason for him to not give you his wife's number. "
437,"I know it sounds pretty harsh when it's laid bare like that, but here is a guy that is so concerned about making you happy, that he's shoving aside whatever objections he had previously to give you something that's important to you. Relationships are all about making compromises and little sacrifices - each of you paying out piece by piece to make a strong foundation. Sure, in a perfect world you'd be lock-step on just about everything, but the world is far from perfect and we have to make it better in whatever way we can."
438,Probably not OP after she has surgery.
439,"Wow , thats cool. I wish a similar thing happened to me"
440,"**Things your girlfriend hates:**

Accommodating your feelings

**Things your girlfriend likes:**

Basically being single/not with you.

**Solution**

Find a girlfriend who actually cares about your feelings and wants to be with you."
441,"How old is your brother? That's a ridiculous reason to not come to a siblings wedding and I can't believe you're letting that slide but not someone seeing a sick relative. How far in advance did he tell you? A week? A month? Honestly, if he told you in advance that's even more absurd. 


Your priorities are bizarre. "
442,Yep I've decided unless she gives me a sincere apology then I will just not engage at all. If she gives me an apology I'll be friendly but there's no way I can go back to the way we were before. I'll just be civil. 
443,"I had this situation with someone I had met through a message board for law school. 

I wanted the bigger room and made it known that I'd pay extra for it. We agreed on 60/40 split (the bigger room had a much nicer bathroom with a jacuzzi tub as well). 

I'd go that route. Tell him he can have it if he wants to do 60/40 or 65/35. "
444,"OP, if you can stomach being around him again, I'd try and record audio of him saying those awful things. He might be smart enough to not admit anything via text, but he might not suspect you of recording your conversations with him. Best way to naturally bring up the conversation is to pretend that you want to lecture him and convince *him* he should break up with her or be a better person. This way it doesn't feel forced, like you're trying to recreate the conversation from before."
445,"Living together means compromise. Can you game some nights, and do something with him other nights?

And yeah, system's yours. If you were to break up, you'd take it with you.
But it's in your living room, and if it's your only TV then while you live together you should both have equal usage rights to it."
446,"The ""sorry to bother you again"" and the ""I know you don't​ love me anymore"" are pretty cringey and I'd take those out. "
447,Better now than in a few years....

450,"Really, your problem here is the relationship, not the condoms. It doesn't sound like there is a 'spark' between you that will end up in a relationship. If you're just seeking casual sex that's fine, but you seem to want more than that.

I would have that conversation with her before sleeping with her again. If all she wants is a casual relationship and you're fine with that, establish the condom use then."
451,"I respect and admire your decision but with that same respect, this is not the point here. 

The bf (OP) is someone who drink alcohol, from what we know, sensibly. The gf is someone, like your parents, who has been traumatized by alcohol in the family. I just think this is a basic incompatibility between them. "
452,"Go do the job. Your parents want to control you, and have neglected your mental health in the past. Being cooped up in the house when your mental state isn't totally fucked is the worst thing you can do.

I have depression, and I agree that this sounds like an excellent opportunity for you. Your mom is trying to control you, plain and simple. If your parents had been otherwise supportive, then this would be different, but they haven't been. 

Stopping you from getting anti-anxiety meds as a teenager was unbelievably cruel. You have clearly been able to improve your mental health, and this sounds like something that you think will help. I'm inclined to think you're right. 

Honestly? You're 21, you're an adult. Don't give in. Tell your mom ""I understand that you just want me to be healthy, but by trying to stop me from taking this job is only going to force me backwards in my mental health. This is what is right for me. I'm not asking for permission, I'm informing you of my plans. Continued discussion about this will do nothing but push me away. This is no longer up for debate. If you continue to bring it up, I will end the conversation."" 

And do it. 
It sounds like you're making great decisions for your growth and mental health, and this sounds like a great experience! Have fun and be great to those kids. "
453,"&gt; Once you've resolved the emotional level, you guys can talk about the pragmatic alternatives that would let her contribute to building equity

Nah, it's not that.  They are financially incompatible.  He's the one with the plans.  He's got the plan to save up money, he's got the plan for buying a house, heck he's even got the plan for how she can increase her income.  What's her plan?  She's got the new car along with the payment, she's got a collection of pets, she's living in the moment.  He can't just come up with a plan for her and expect her to follow it, that's not who she is, at this point in her life anyway.  They didn't just wake up the other day and all of a sudden they're on different pages about buying a house, she never participated with him in his plans during the entire three years they've been together.  It seems like they just swept it under the rug, and now they can't just ignore it anymore.  "
454,"If she reacts at all (90% chance she won't), just say ""Yea I know, but let's be responsible"" then smile/wink and keep the mood going. Try to be smooth about it."
455,"Whoa, okay, talk about an overreaction.

This is a major failure to communicate all around.  Both sides are assuming it's the other's dog pooping in the sister's room, and they just keep passive aggressively escalating things without talking to each other.  Imagine the sister's perspective.  If your roommate's dog kept crapping in your room and they refused to clean it up, wouldn't you eventually get fed up?

I agree they shouldn't be living together, but they need to have an adult talk and work out their issues. 

 OP, stop venting to your boyfriend behind the sister's back and making him feel like he's in the middle and just talk to the sister.  Work with her to figure out whose dog is doing the pooping so you can solve that in the short term, and then work on a plan with the sister to move her out on a reasonable timeline so you don't kill each other.  If you evict her, you're asking your boyfriend to burn his relationship with his sister.  That's never going to happen."
456,You're justified in this being a deal breaker but have you tried just telling her it makes you uncomfortable? Maybe she has an oral fixation and low impulse control.
457,"For me, it comes in in that feminism, as a movement, is about women supporting women. 

When you become the other woman in a relationship knowingly and ""help"" the man cheat on his spouse/girlfriend, then you're knowingly undermining a relationship where typically a portion of a person's self-worth is invested in. You're helping to (potentially) take away a chunk of someone's confidence and their sense of worth just to have a romp. Very few things can do the emotional damage that being cheated on does to you. It's just cruel and unkind and selfish to willingly be the other woman.

Yes, I know the argument that if it wasn't her, it would have been someone else. But if women presented a seriously united front against men who try to cheat, unless they start batting for the other side, they'll never find a partner willing to be that 3rd party.

To me, women doing that to other women does undermine feminism. But, it's also 4am and I might just be talking out my ass."
458,"But where do they get this idea? That's what I can't figure out. I mean, there are pretty much no positive outcomes that you ever see from this strategy, only negative ones. Why do people keep trying it and what the fuck makes it seem like a good idea in the first place?

"
459,But that should be completely her decision without any pressure from her mom.
460,"How did the spiteful ex-boyfriend know what texts you had seen, and to ensure that those were in the faked screenshots?"
461,"Is his stuff going missing too? If it's always yours, sorry, but he is taking it. I would secretly take your valuable items to a family/friend's house immediately, you don't know what he is going to take next. I would consider breaking up. You deserve better than a gaslighting thief. "
462,"I did the stay-at-home thing .   I don't understand how people say it was ""hard,"" especially with just one child.   It can be boring and losing some adult interaction all day until your SO comes home can get lonely.  But hard?  Never understood that for one child. "
463,"Not even. If the kid has developmental or health issues, co patenting daily goes for life. But, even if the kid is normal, what the other parent is doing for good or ill will always be a part of your life. Mom gets MS? Looks like dad has to pitch in more for college and so on. Life makes sure to keep things complicated."
464,"Fo'real, I do this to my girlfriend all the time. I'll accidentally take the TV remote to the bathroom with me and she'll loose her mind looking for it in the living room."
465,"chiming in for scissors and nail clippers here.  i am a pretty organized woman, too...those just freaking disappear.  i moved recently, and ended up finding allllll of them.  i could have opened a Sharp Things store.

of course, now they're all lost again."
466,"""Protect yourself""? WTF does that mean? You lied and cheated if you were exclusive, there's no reason to do an LDR from the start, just drop it. You have ""really"" talked to other people, champ. "
467,"I see where you're coming from, but if he does this it's validating her unreasonable behavior and will only encourage it to continue."
468,"Haha same! Except she would insist she didn't move my stuff because she forgot she did but then I would find my stuff moved and she would just be like ""oh"" then do it again. So annoying. "
469,By the look of this. The way she is acting is just normal Indian mother behavior. It may just be something you have to grin and bear it.
470,"You have only physically been in a relationship four months with the rest being LDR? I think it's way to soon to move in together, while long LDR can work (my relationship started LDR) you only knew her four months with daily interaction. You still have a lot to learn about how she is face to face unless you knew each other before dating?"
471,"&gt;A lot of the things I've trained him, my wife goes against it. She used to give me so much crap when I was training him when he was a puppy. For example now she feeds him all the time at the table so he begs everybody. I stopped caring about a lot of things because it would just make me really upset, so I had to stop caring in order not to go crazy.


This is really not good.  As other commenters have highlighted, how would your parenting dynamic work?

Also - what gives her the right?  It's your dog and you had a training program for him?  What makes her think she can undermine that?  Feeding from the table is really bad, how did that start and why did it continue??"

473,oh my god the post history is barrel of monkeys level crazy.
474,"she's out for something. if you read op's responses, she deliberately does it when he isn't paying attention to her. he starts playing a video game, she has a seizure and all the lunacy begins. it only happens at his place. it doesn't happen anywhere else. she might not be a mastermind, but I really don't think this is just her not being able to cope with her emotional problems. she has emotional problems and she's on lithium and she's in therapy. that doesn't mean she's absolved and it's just her ""bizarre coping methods"""
475,"I agree. I'm graduating from undergrad in a few weeks. One of my friends has a bf who dropped out of school and is now an extremely successful mechanic, plumber, electrician, all around handy-man. By successful, I mean if my friend didn't want to work she wouldn't need to study - he could easily support them both, in an expensive city no less.

He doesn't *get* school on a fundamental level. The idea of going to university was about as appealing to him as eating a four-course meal made entirely out of shit would be.

He is gonna take her on holiday after she graduates, he's organised a big dinner and invited all of her family from across the country, he posts stuff on Facebook like ""so proud of my sweetheart Emily for finishing her dissertation 😍"" he's actually disgustingly supportive lol. 

You don't need to understand what your SO is going through or why they would bother. You can even think it's kinda pointless. But you do need to be supportive of the ways they are trying to improve themself and the things they have struggled hard to achieve."
476,You're making a lot of excuses for behavior that is pretty bad. It's not really acceptable in any way AND you've begun to NORMALIZE this.

478,"Please get to therapy. You sound like an awesome person, and do not deserve to live carrying this guilt and hurt. 

None here will be equipped to help you with this situation, you do need the help of a professional.

Lots of love. And please give your BF a huge kiss, he is a good man also. "
479,"You were living with a monster. Focus on your future, your boyfriend and career. It is your father's fault for being an insecure piece of trash. He was extremely abusive to you in the past. Culture be damned, anyone that thinks yelling/hitting a child for the fucking sake of it is TRASH."
480,"No need to get personal... we all state our opinions. For the record, being with my partner 9 years.  Not jealous and trust him completely.  Our situation is very difficult from OP's.

482,"Errr... ""Married 2 years ago"" ""20f"" Were you guys dating when you were a teenager? I mean, that's major red flag right off the bat, especially since 2 years in an y'all are already having intimacy issues. Sorry OP, but this marriage sounds like the mistake of hormone fueled teen years, and he sounds like he's regretting it, too. And, most men going after women too young for them go after them for shady reasons. The age gap here is definitely playing a role, but if you really want to make it work, you can always try different things in bed, foreplay is pretty important too."
483,"1) I KNOW RIGHT. They heat in the dryer and that allows them to release the good smells. 

2) Thanks for the kick. I get flustered in the moment, but it happens often enough now that I should prepare and (calmly) reasonably respond."
484,"""I hate to ask, but I was wondering if we could have we both could have sort of a boundary on how late a guest of the opposite sex stays over. When you said you had to go last night at like 1am because _____ and you were going to make a late night snack when we previously planned a call together, it made me feel a bit dejected. Especially when you mentioned early in our relationship that, ""Having someone over really late, until 1 or 2am, is unnecessary and probably too far"". I understand if you don't feel the same way about a boundary like this, but I would love to be able to talk about it together."""
485,[deleted]
486,"&gt;It made me sad and irritable. He had a short temper then, so he would be set off when I wasn't in a good mood. 

This isn't an accusation, I just want to check: Did you ever start the fight, or acted rude based on your irritation? Because it's odd to see someone say 'I was irritable, so he started fights."" Surely he's the irritable one then?

&gt;He's the type of person where if I'm mad, he becomes mad too. That's just how he is. 

But why is him being mad the problem, not you? Is there a specific behaviour he is doing and you aren't that makes them different?

&gt;We don't fight all of the time, though I made it sound like that. We are going through a ""try not to fight"" phase because we're going through stress again.

That still makes it sound like you fight all the time. That's not normal for couples. Could you answer the question with an estimated number of times per week or day you fight? How often does he give you silent treatment?

&gt;And of course we've had some fights since then, so I included those in my thought process. 

Yes, including the fights that happened in your estimation of how often you fight, is pretty reasonable. That aren't any that 'dont count', no matter the reason. "
487,"&gt;I probably am partially to blame

&gt;I kind of left the gate open

How about you step up and take responsibility for the fact that you made a mistake? If you speak about this in the same terms to your wife, I fully understand why she's upset with you and untrusting of your choices when it comes to minding the kids. It was an accident of course, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't own it. "
488,Asshole culture is surprisingly universal! 
489,They do have a gate whichOp left open! Wifey is not to blame at all.
490,That is exactly what he wants. You need to get out.
491,"Your self esteem is clearly at rock bottom which is not helping you here. You don't talk about whether you love each other, it all sounds very practical and weighed out. You come across as very depressed and valuing materialistic things. There's more to life than being a wage earner. It sounds like you're trying very hard. You could do with some counseling to treat your depression and low self image. Try reading the books self compassion by kristin neff and self acceptance by tara brach. Also the dance of connection by harriet lerner. Learn to love yourself for who you are and listen to your SO and hear him. If he says he's happy take him at his word. Good luck. "
492,"Well, they told me they weren't going to be there a week before. 

I get that a second wedding is not as big as a first. That's why we only invited close friends and family. With all the kids, parents, cousins, etc., we only invited about five of my friends. 

They knew about our date a year in advance just through general discourse. I were sent out save the dates in October and formal invites in January (i think i got that wrong in my op). 

I'm pretty quiet, and I know weddings are highly emotional and dramatic events, so I had some anxiety about the potential drama. I worked really hard to make my wedding happy. I guess I'm just disappointed. My own brother didn't come because he was depressed about a break up, and I totally understood. I just can't understand my friends. "
493,"So she feels like a bad mother, is way more emotional, and cries for no reason? You should definitely speak to her about PPD. She might keep forgetting about the mayo because she's trying to keep her sanity intact."
494,"You don't want to hear this, but you already know the answer. You cut your losses and divorce him, or you continue living like this. You're 26. You could easily divorce this guy and be married again before you're 30 (not saying that this should be a goal or anything, just making a point that you're still young). Or you could wait a few years until maybe after you guys have a kid or two, and you're still parenting your husband as well. You get so fed up with this asshole that you then finally leave him. Except then, since you have kids, you get to attempt to coparent with someone who can't even parent themselves. And then you're 35 and a single mom and trying to date again. Super fun. 

Bottom line is that he's not going to change. You can divorce him now or later, but he's not going to change. You deserve better and you can have better. I know you love him, but you can also love someone who is an adult and treats you well."
495,"&gt; after completely ignoring me for a full day he hit me in my face three times giving me a black eye

Talk about burying the lede. Jfc. Get out. There's no other advice to give here, there's nothing else to say. You need to leave."
496,I don't think you're overreacting. I would feel much the same way. It takes zero effort to say goodbye. Have you brought it up to him?
497,Read my other response. You're making her your mom. You shouldn't as for her permission you should be working with her so you can BOTH get you time.
498,"Yeah you're going to have to confront your roommate and suggest to her that if she is cold, she should put on more layer, otherwise, she will have to pay the excess heating bill."
499,"Also, I know she doesn't wear it to bed because she doesn't like it getting caught on a blanket or pillow."
500,"Miscarriages are actually incredibly common. 

You should absolutely deal with your medical care and manage your options for having children the way that you want to. But lots of people are piling on about seeing another OBGYN because the details you're sharing with us make it look like the one that you did see is not very good at their job. They are *at least* terrible at patient communication. They should be able to help you understand your condition so that you *know* where they're coming from with your diagnosis, not just think it. 

Lots of women with PCOS never conceive despite the best medical care and extensive treatment. Some do. But some women with PCOS have been told they can't conceive, make their birth control choices assuming they're infertile, then get pregnant by accident. You deserve a full understanding of your condition so that you can make the best health care choices for yourself. It looks like you may need a different doctor to help you get there."
501,There are plenty of people without kids that enjoy their lives.  The problem is that she's trying to force you to do what she wants instead of listening to what you want.  This is a symptom of a much bigger problem.  It's good you get to see it now instead of later once she's forced you to live even more of your life the way she wants instead of being happy with what you want.
502,[removed]
503,This is not a productive or responsible way to talk to children.
504,No! It shows you're a crappy s/o who doesn't give a shit on what his s/o wants!  Just freaking propose! 
505,"&gt; Im here next to her all the time. Ive been here 15 years, is that not enough.

If it was, you wouldn't be here.

Stop trying to use logic to invalidate her opinion while avoiding the fact that you not proposing earlier is illogical."
506,"Tell him the truth. If he's smart, he'll dump you.

You made this bed, now lay in it."
507,"This, so much this! OP, build upon yourself. Get a non-boring life - hobbies, activities, friends, family, an interesting job even. Everything and anything that can fulfill your life. When you build these basic foundations get a partner not to fulfill them for you but to enhance them once already there."
508,This is the absolute bare minimum that OP should accept. 
509,"These are feelings a lot of young couples have, and while others may say that the feelings won't go away... well that's not really up for us to decide. 

For instance, I had a friend who got married at 18 to the guy she'd been dating since 16. They've been together for 8 years now, and while at first, my friend felt like she was missing out, as she grew up and her friends (including myself) have gotten married, she doesn't feel FOMO about it anymore. As a matter of fact, a few of our friends have already gotten divorced from the people they married, so if anything she feels good knowing she picked someone she has always had good connections with, and hasn't had to navigate her entry into adulthood in the somewhat tragic way our friends have.

On the other end of that, my cousin has been with his girlfriend since he was 17. They're not married because my cousin has problem with cheating and they're not broken up because they believe they've got to make it work because they've been together for almost 10 years now. My cousin has DEFINITELY expressed that his FOMO has made his relationship more difficult, and honestly I wish they would understand that just because they've put so much time into it thus far, does not mean they should keep doing that.

But I think it depends on who you are. Maybe you still feel like you're missing out, but maybe you feel like you'd be missing out more in the long run to let your girlfriend go? Could you live with letting her go for the possibility of other or no meaningful relationships? Another issue involved here is that if you broke up with her and then never found another meaningful relationship, could you live with that?

I think those are the kinds of questions you need to ask yourself. And from there you'd have your answer on what to do about it. If you'd more regret never being independent of your girlfriend, then break up."
510,"You sound like a person who drives drunk and then says ""well no one was killed so it's all a moot overdramatic point,"" like they should be redeemed by a stroke of luck. "
511,"Yes, and every used car I've ever dealt with has had little hidden deposits of Cheerios, dog kibble, Happy Meal toys, band-aids, Kleenex purse packs, coins, fluff, tampons, ballpoint pens, and/or unidentified stray pills."
512,"The thing is... at the moment, it's not a healthy friendship. You're hurting due to feelings you can't help and he's already sensing something's awry because you're avoiding him.

It would be great if we could switch emotions on and off at will, but reality means we sometimes have to face the more difficult ones head-on in order to deal with them. Unless you think you can deal with another 10 years of hurt and avoidance, this is one of those times, I'm afraid."
513,"While it may be decriminalized on the state level it isn't on the federal level. Distribution can still be a federal offense.  

Edit: spelling"
514,"&gt;But the fact that she doesn't wanna try... Idk why but its different.

I'm guessing you're bothered by her lack of effort? 

It IS hurtful to hear that she doesn't want to try because you would still look at other girls anyway because 1) she is assuming you would do it 2) she assumed that you're asking her to lose weight because she's not attractive enough for you when you have her best interests at heart. 

I think you should sit her down and point out that you want her to try out these activities because you want her to be healthier/lead a healthier lifestyle and that you being more attracted to her is just an added bonus. You should encourage her to lose weight for her own sake (to be healthy) and tell her that you're with her regardless of her size.  

I don't think there's anything wrong with wanting your partner to be healthier. It's not like you're giving her an ultimatum.
"
515,Why can't they ban her from the store?
516,"Yes. Keep it short. Offer no explanation whatsoever. It's not a decision that's up for discussion. After you send the message, ignore the rest unless they mercilessly continue in which case you simply say ""please stop messaging me."" "
517,"I think your views on sex are twisting typical doctors appointments into something sexual resulting in your insecurity.

I think to make it to your age without ever having sex indicates you had a strict upbringing. It would explain why you are okay with your gf's overbearing parents (normal to you) and why you have so much anxiety surrounding this situation.

I think you should see a therapist and I'm not one to normally give that advice."

I treat them 70% like adults and 30% like my parents. 

I do things they don't like. That's fine. They can have opinions. Everyone has an opinion. But their opinion doesn't have to matter to me. I don't have to fear their judgement. 

They can do things I don't like. That's fine. I can say huh, I appreciate you feel that way mom. Hard for me to have perspective. If she gets mad, fine, I treat her the way I would if my coworker got mad and yelled at me like a child. I walk away. 

It's awkward at first - also means I can't expect them to coddle me, always take my side, or think I'm doing the right thing all the time. But it does get rid of that feeling of being babysat. "

525,"1) Buy area rugs. Put them down in the hall, living room, kitchen, bathroom, etc. They look nice and greatly reduce noise. 

However, remember you pay to live there too. You have as much right to enjoy your apartment and live as those folks below you do. 

I get there sob story is rough. I'd do my best to be considerate too. 

Once you've put rugs down and left your shoes at the door. Tell your landlord (even just an email) You've had some personal complaints about noise. You've attempted X Y and Z to reduce it. The person complaining is concerned about the sound of foot steps. Your worried this will escalate and are unsure how to fix it because you've done X Y Z. 

You've done your part - now they need to buy a fan for white noise or get the fuck over it. I work 12 hours , as a paramedic on nights. So Not only am I up from 7pm-7am , I'm covered in shit and puke well doing it. My apartment has a really noisey elevator. My girlfriend moving positions wakes me up. The cats meowing wakes me up. I am a light sleeper. But thats MY problem. I purchased a 40 dollar fan on amazon , never slept better in my life. 

Do what you can, and once its done, its that guys problem. Hell if your really stressed, buy him a fan off amazon, write a note explaining and gift it to the guy - Killing people with kindness is the best way to defuse situations (least in Canada , I dunno about America, ya'll got guns and scare me lol)"

It seems to me that you somehow feel guilty for being/staying in an abusive relationship, but you have to understand that abusive relationships can be very hard to leave, and you should be proud of yourself for getting out at all (even if it's because you were dumped). Your friends and family and counselor should be relieved and happy for you, not angry that you didn't listen to them sooner.

It's not just ""a simple lunch"" and it's not about you being weak. People we love and care about can hurt us very easily because by the simple virtue of loving someone, we become vulnerable. Even to things as ""little"" as ""just lunch.""

FWIW, I don't think this is a little thing. I don't think you're wrong or weak to be so hurt and affected by her shitty behavior. I certainly would be devastated if my gf was acting this way. It's a betrayal of your trust as well as a harsh wake-up reminder that she's probably not a great person. That hurts to realize.

I'm not saying dump her immediately. It sounds like you really care about her. It's always worth it to try talking things out, just don't be optimistic that she'll see things your way. I can't imagine someone doing what she did/is doing would be able to acknowledge their shittiness through a simple conversation. Just be prepared for the worst, and **don't let her convince you that you're overreacting or that ""it's not a big deal.""** You are 100% entitled to your opinions and emotions, and she is 100% in the wrong here."
547,"Yeah, I've come to realise that he'll say the same about me - make me look like a total basket case.

It's so good to hear you don't think I'm broken because that's how I see myself.

554,"&gt;how he wishes he could just smack me once when I'm like this

Whoa, what?  Way to gloss over that part. 

Girl, that is not right.

 That is a threat, or priming you for abuse, or even if it's not as dangerous as that, it's still messed up. Most people in normal relationships don't ""wish"" they could smack their partner. You're going to say it's just a figure of speech, he's just saying that he wants me to wake up and smell the coffee. And I'm going to tell you that caring, kind, considerate, emotionally grounded people do not think such a thing, much less say it to someone they are supposed to love. 

Women his age, even close to his age,  wouldn't put up with his bullshit, that's why he dates younger women. That and the power imbalance. 

Y'know, thirty-somethings often have their shit together, but it would be a little age difference for you. Have you thought about dating someone older who isn't just a power-tripping, rude asshole?  I mean, not to offend you, but really... I feel like you could do a lot better than this guy."
555,"Why the hell did you tell your parents this?  What kind of reaction did you expect???  You know you don't have to tell your parents everything, right?

I would just lie and say she quit and then have some common sense on the overshare in the future."
556,"If I were you, then I wouldn't ask her again. She doesn't want you to go. 

She isn't answering the question. Think about it. What are the repercussions for answering the question? Why isn't she giving you a straight answer? Most people won't because they think the person won't like the answer.

A) If she answers with a yes she wants you to go, then what is she loosing? Nothing. You will have a good time and then you guys can celebrate later.

B) If she answers with a no she doesn't want you to go, then what is she loosing? She might upset you. Look selfish for making you stay home. She will be the one that decided to break the tradition. Etc.

So the only reason she isn't answering is because of option B. The only option that makes sense.

562,"So sorry this happened to you.  It's a terrible thing to do to someone you supposedly love.  The thing that helped my last breakup the most was remembering to keep perspective.  He didn't love you like you deserved to be loved.  If he had, if he was the *ONE*, you wouldn't be in this position.  

* Try not to focus on the loss of hopes/dreams.  Focus on his actions and how you were treated.  That process will help you to keep looking and moving forward and not staying stuck or going backwards.  

* No contact really, truly helps.  Don't just delete him, but BLOCK him from EVERYTHING.  Trust me when I say you do NOT want to see him move on with his life or rebound.  Nothing will set you back further and faster than that self-imposed torture method.

* FEEL every emotion to its fullest but KNOW they are just emotions that will pass.  Some days you will wake up hurt and crying...it will pass.  Other days you'll wake up numb or angry.  These emotions too will pass.  Try to take walks or jogs/runs when you're feeling especially shitty.  It's really crazy how unpredictable your emotions will become during the breakup process.  Just try to remember it is all a literal chemical withdrawal process happening in your brain.  

* Try not to think about your families and all of the external issues you mentioned in your post...I know it's easier said than done, but your relationship was ultimately between the two of you.  If you are truly that close with his family, you will still be able to maintain relationships with them later on down the road.  I had a really bad breakup a couple of years ago with a 10+ year ex who I thought I was going to be with forever as well.  2 years later, we are still going strong with no-contact, but I still adore many of the ex's family members as they do me, and we have maintained friendships.  

I know it doesn't seem like it, but life moves on.  Just stay strong and know you are extremely resilient and worthy of love.  One day you will wake up and realize you are finally free of the hurt and the pain and that you are better off.  Hugs, Internet stranger. I promise it will be okay someday even though it doesn't feel like it will.  &lt;3"

564,"I think I'm going to broach something that the other posters haven't.  This is likely because it's going to probably get a lot of downvotes.

Are you 100% certain that staying and being a father is really what's best for the child?

That must seem like such a cold thing to say.  Let me assure you that my intention isn't to tear you down, hate on the baby or imply you should be a deadbeat dad.  What I want to urge you to do is check whether the presumption that staying around is the best option for everyone involved.

Not everyone is cut out to be a parent.  I really appreciate that you decided it wasn't for you.  I'm also impressed that you want to do what you think is right, which seems to be to support your child and its mother.  The thing is that your situation is a pretty extreme one.  Your mental health isn't great and is keeping you from working.  You never wanted to be a parent and have a lot of resentment and bitterness built up.  Is this a situation that is fair to bring a child into?

A child can tell when they're not wanted or are resented.

Maybe that will magically change when you hold the baby for the first time.  Or perhaps you'll grow into the role of a father.  The thing is that is not a guarantee.  With so much on your mental plate already... adding sleepless nights, stress and frustration seems like a very bad idea.

To be honest, you need to assess this according to what your current mental state allows you to do.  This can be hard and often heart breaking but it's necessary.  Can you be a good dad with your current limitations?


Now, I'm not advocating abandoning this child and its mother.  There are options.  You can support them financially, if possible.  You can have visitation.  You can decide how much interaction and day-to-day responsibility is best for the child and you.

Your girlfriend did something horrible.  She has to know that you might not be able to be there 100% as a father.  Perhaps you can come up with mutually acceptable alternatives.  It's better than raising expectations and then enduring the crushing feeling that comes with being unable to fulfill those hopes and dreams."

Even though you chose to forgive, you don't have to forget. It's reasonable to ask about a photo posted to his instagram of just a girl, cause tbh that's weird. He seems like he hasn't changed from when he broke your trust the first time and that he may be at least flirting with other girls behind your back. I would end it before it goes any further "

I wouldn't directly talk with her parents, but as part of confronting your wife you can tell her that she either comes clean with everything to her parents or you show them the evidence that you have. If this guy is such a good family friend, they will most likely not believe you unless she tells them the truth."
569,"Yeah, saintly puts a positive spin on it. He is co-dependent with his mother. If you have a tendency for co-dependence in relationships, you two were probably were a good fit in the beginning.

In a relationship for FIVE months and he's already looking to propose? Either he's more certain than he's ever been of anything or he's rushing things. Guessing at it being the latter. I'm guessing he's a bit of a romantic at heart, since he's gone the traditional route and asked your father about this. At least your father is a realist enough to impose a condition to throw on the brakes, slow things down to a better speed. Ideally, he'd be better off getting to know her for those two or so years, then thinking of proposing. It just seems a rush job otherwise.

I don't think you need to be too obtuse about saying it. She's your sister, and more, your twin. Maybe I just go by the vague stereotype that it's all the more easy to talk to her because of that."

583,"I fully agree. Everyone seems to have picked up on the fact that she only was interested in you after the baby. I'd be torn between demanding, albeit politely, an explanation, and it'd better be good. Also, I'd want grandpa involved so he can see she lied all those years earlier (but I'm not expecting that to work, he might not care which would be more evidence to not connect).

I'd bet she would do the same thing to your child. 

Seeing as I fully expect any explanation from her to either blame you or refuse to admit fault, wouldn't give her another chance. She was supposed to be the adult and you and your family handled the situation with way more grace than I would have.  I don't think I would regret my child not knowing grandparents like that but that is purely personal. You seem like you know how to handle this maturely. It just comes down to your preference.

I guess he talks to her on the phone a few times a week? I literally do not even have her phone # or email address, &amp; we've been married for over a year.

You don't have to have a perfect witty comeback, and you don't have to succeed in teaching the other person a lesson - the important thing is having the guts to say anything at all.

Your parents are letting ALL of you down. 

They're letting your youngest brother down. That kind of abuse is incredibly damaging.

They're letting your middle brother down as well. He needs help, and if his behavior isn't corrected- he's on a bad road. What happens if he destroys his college roommate's things and ends up arrested? This could ruin his life.

If you get the proof, you can go to the school or his doctor and push for him to be evaluated. If you're in the US, your school system can evaluate him. They may need your parents permission, but if they approach your parents as professionals- something might happen.

I have seen this happen and escalate. You may need to go to CPS. Honestly, if I were you, I would look into what I need to do to get custody of the 9 year old after I turned 18, while praying it doesn't come to that. I know that is extreme, but so are your circumstances.

If no one helps your middle brother, he is only going to get bigger and meaner. He is hurting your younger brother, he could really mess him up in a few years. If your middle brother won't listen, someone has to protect your youngest brother.

It also has significant health consequences.  Increases chances for depression, anxiety, weight gain, bad cholesterol, a whole host of things.

And that's just ""over an hour.""  Four hours is killer.  I can't imagine.  "
603,"Honestly... To me it sounds like he's been trying to justify having an affair.  You really had no choice but to do what you did.  This may sound cold .. But I think its time to focus on you and your needs.  You've been riding the roller coaster with him and terminating a pregnancy can affect you for a long time after if you don't deal with it.  I've been there.  I terminated a pregnancy a month before I left my abusive ex.  Totally the right decision for me and I don't regret it, but it affected me a lot more then I realized.  Take some time for yourself.  Use the distance to evaluate what YOU want and whether you are happy.  If you doing put yourself first no one else will."
604,"This. OP, I doubt the gift will have made more than a month's difference to when you pay the house off. Obviously it's not sustainable to do that regularly, but I don't think you really want to choose this specific gift as the hill to die on. You're going to have plenty of times down the years when you don't think you were on her mind enough, and vice versa - marriages go through good times and bad times that way. So appreciate the times you are important to her, even if the practice of it is misguided.

Personally, I would wait until the next time there is a gift-occasion (ideally, someone else's such as extended family) and then raise a conversation about the role of gift-giving in your budget, and use that to set some ground rules for (a) gifts to third parties and (b) gifts to each other while you're trying to pay down the house. 

But there's really no point in making her feel like crap for this one IMO. The gift can't be returned, so it can't be undone. And she probably thought (unless the subject has been specifically discussed, which it sounds like it hasn't) that gifts to one another on special occasions are ""separate"" from normal spending. To a lot of people, especially people with a gift-giving love language, that's ""feeding"" your relationship and you wouldn't skimp on it the way you would skimp on other luxuries."
605,You might also want to check over at r/legaladvice. Having kids in your pool can be an insurance liability and you can explain this to your neighbours. Perhaps (if they're at all reasonable) they might be more understanding of they realise this.
606,"I am not an expert in relationships.  But I'll hazard a guess.

I think that your father might be trying to overcompensate for his non-biological children.  He wishes to avoid favoritism of his only biological child, which has led to (oddly enough) reverse-favoritism of every non-biological child; all the while, he remains unaware of how he is treating his actual biological child differently in spite of his intentions to treat every child of his (biological or not) the same way.

It's only a theory, but I think it's a plausible one based on the details I've seen.  I'm honestly not sure what you could do about it, to be honest.  If you're still on speaking terms, perhaps you could try to bring it up with him and ask him why; sometimes just being frank (and polite!) about things is just the easiest way forward."
607,"So you should basically take your own advice here?

Maybe you could share some of the movie titles and some hopefully helpful redditors could point you in a direction online by which you could recover them?

616,"I really encourage you to step back a moment and consider how valuable it is to have friends who tell you how they feel. Sometimes we say things that hurt or offend other people unintentionally. Just because it wouldn't bother *us* doesn't mean that it shouldn't bother them. The right thing to do is *communicate*, not run away and avoid someone. Find out why they feel disrespected, and apologize for overstepping a boundary, miscommunicating, or failing to consider how someone else might perceive what you're saying. Aren't you sorry when your friends feel crappy about something you've done? Or do you rather like when your friends feel crappy? When you're misunderstood, don't you regret that there was a misunderstanding? Or do you believe people should be able to just reach into your brain and understand and agree with your intentions? Apologizing and getting to the bottom of hurt feelings isn't some kind of affront to your integrity or value as a person, it's an act of compassion and kindness -- one that I'm pretty sure you expect others to extend to you when roles are reversed. 

Do you want truthful friendships built on communication, collaboration, and kindness? Friendships that endure misunderstandings and hardships?

Or do you want one sided, controlled friendships where interactions revolve around your needs but no one else's, and fall apart at the first sign of conflict?

If it's the latter you're looking for, by all means, ""avoid"" your friends. But if not - even if you don't feel the same or don't particularly like what your friend has to say, or agree with their logic, find a way to listen and understand, apologize for the misunderstanding at the very least, and then agree to disagree or agree to avoid a topic or something. Don't just run away and hide from people because you're uncomfortable. That's a surefire way to make sure you're captain of dysfunctional relationships, and isn't productive for anyone.

623,"Why do you need an ""unfiltered opinion"" from a woman about your relationship? If you're having issues you talk to your partner about them, not your friends/family/strangers. Inserting another person into your relationship would make anyone uncomfortable. Think about it from her perspective - every time you two have an issue you're running to another woman to get her advice on how to handle your girlfriend. Can she really trust you at this point to not blab personal information? And even worse, she won't know if you're actually being genuine or if you're just following a script a friend, whom you trusts with intimate info of your relationships to far more than anyone else, fed to him to get him the best results. 

Also, nothing in your post even indicates you actually think this is an issue either. You're asking how to make your girlfriend stop being upset at this, not what you can do to make it up to her or strengthen your relationship. What is more important to you? Having a close female friend that you blab to, or having a girlfriend who feels she can trust you? "

OP, you are not to blame and not at fault in this. You need to *in your own mind* stop taking responsibility for what your ex did to you and stop, today and for the rest of your life, thinking that you had any power to change them. Yes, you could have left earlier *if* you'd had the ability, but you didn’t; you grew, and now you have the power to stay away and protect yourself.

You are getting better all the time, but even if you'd been the best person you could be, you could not have controlled another person."
631,"Kudos for being so level-headed. This is honestly insanity. Your husband proposes that he would leave his wife and children, and the family home, to go live with friends/housemates, and he think YOU are the one who would be unreasonable by ending the relationship.

This is like, some twilight zone shit. By doing this, he would be saying ""what I want to do, and living with my friends, is more important than my relationship with my wife and children"". Yeah, no shit you're not going to be happy with that. Did you guys take marriage vows? Did he cut out the 'above all others / forsaking all others' part, or is he just conveniently forgetting that this EXACT SITUATION was covered off in those. He literally vowed not to pull this shit.

And in the case of the OP, if the content his gf is posting makes him uncomfortable, then of course he should speak up!

He tried to frame you for what was essentially a murder that he caused. His reckless behaviour killed your friend, left you with a TBI - and instead of feeling rightly remorseful or regretful for his actions, he tried to blame you and ruin your life to save his own skin. 

He doesn't care about you, or anyone else, only himself. You can turn him in to the police (I would), but at the absolute minimum you have to completely erase him and all traces of your so-called friendship to move forward with your life. Block him everywhere, for good. Do not engage him in person, cross the street if you see him coming. Move on with your life without him in it."
647,"&gt; I could see how that was annoying

If he has the patience of a two-year-old then yeah, I can also see why that might be annoying. But an adult can just hang and play cell phone games for 15 extra minutes.

649,"What makes you say it's a ""horrible risk for men""?

The risk of alimony comes up whenever one spouse makes considerably more than the other.  And while that's still more common for men, there are also plenty of marriages where the spouses are on much more equal footing income-wise or the wife makes more than the husband.  In this case we have no idea what the financial situation of OP/the husband are, so we can't say who would be more at risk in the event of a divorce.

In addition, I'm pretty sure that men do benefit from marriage if there's a custody battle."
650,"Right? When I say I don't have ambition, what I mean is that I'm perfectly happy where I am. My boyfriend and I were having one of those what-would-you-do-if-you-won-the-lotto talks and he said ""...and you could open your own publishing house!"" since I work in publishing and I was like ""nope, thanks"". If I had a lot of money I would still be happy with my freelance work. I don't wanna be where my ""boss"" is in 5 or 10 years. And, like you said, that doesn't mean we get to slack off and not pull our own weight. I care about my SO and even if he was rich and told me I could be a housewife I would still want to work to feel independent. Lack of professional ambition is different from being happy with being a leech in my opinion."
651,This one event is not a big deal. OP acknowledges that it's less about the particular event and more that it made her reassess and realize that she feels like his mom. I think that she should have focused on the overall picture more since the wedding story clearly obfuscates her real question about whether or not to give him a chance to grow up.

It sounds like you're a convenient girlfriend to him but he doesn't seem to have you as a priority.

He doesn't ride with me every day as it is, so I am not his ride. His ride is the bus. 

The issue is that he had no concern for me. I am being literal when I say that the first thing he said after I told him I wasn't feeling well enough to go to class was to ask if I could drive him. 

It's common sense that if I can't sit in class for an hour, I can't sit in traffic for an hour. If he wasn't so self-centered maybe he would have thought of this. "

I can promise you this, as a person who is planning a wedding and has helped friends in the past plan theirs-- OP is not the only person asking for a +1. Tons of people, including single people, ask for them. It is frustrating as hell having to deflect those questions, especially when the asker is a person that was only invited out of obligation or is someone who just wants to bring some random person you don't know.

667,"That part is weird, for sure. The worst part to me is definitely the work from home thing. But, do you think that gaming in the shared space for 2 hours every worknight while expecting your partner to wait to spend time with you or use the space until you decide you're done is respectful of his needs? He has as much right to wind down in the living room aftrr work as she does. If she wants to retain full ownership of the system and deny the same to him, it needs to go out of the main spot, period. There's a reason it wasn't used as the main entertainment system when she had roommates. If she wants it front and center, then she needs to share it. And, maybe every other day, she should probably hang out with him *before* she plays games to show him he is not less important. 

He probably feels like the living room is OP's, not theirs together, and is expressing it really badly. And like she cares more about her games than about him feeling at home. She probably feels stifled, which is causing her to clamp down on her own stuff when really she needs to compromise. If they actually wanna stay together not break up, she also needs to adjust her activities. When you move in with someone, you do have to adjust to make your lives compatible, and that will mean sacrifices on bothe their parts (OP only ever says she stops at an agreed upon time, for instance, and I bet that if instead she played games after first giving her bf attention instead of vice versa, he would be receptive to her complaints too)."

It seemed impossible at the time, but I moved on. I focused on myself for awhile, eventually met someone, and now.... Well. Now, whenever I read those askreddit posts that go ""You wake up 5 years old but with all your memories. What do you do differently?"" I get anxietyish when I really think about it. Would I do those years differently at the risk of changing my present? I *love* the life I have now. Those years are apart of who I am now. Nothing can change that. They happened.

I've never heard of anyone starting up the practice when the child is an adult, though.  I don't even know if people who kiss their kid on the lips commonly continue it when the child is grown.  Anyone?"

We all need space sometimes. I get it, I really do. But that's why I asked him to compromise by just saying ""bye"" or ""night"".

677,"Did he never learn about dominant and recessive genes in biology class? Dark features tend to be dominant, so he should have known the kids would end up with the darker skin, hair, etc. Does he not see the bone structure, mannerisms, and other features you pointed out? Has one inherited his athletic ability, speech patterns, sense of humor or other such traits? Perhaps you can find family photos from his side of the family - do any of the children resemble family members on his side?

I have a feeling the ""D'Angelos"" comment has him upset more than anything. Some men feel very strongly about carrying on the family name and passing on their genes,  so the fact that someone stated they look like your family may have hurt his ego, as silly as that may be. As others have already pointed out, children often start out resembling one parent and then later looking more like the other, so there is a chance his features will be more apparent as the children grow. Heck, sometimes a child resembles neither parent and later it is discovered they look just like an uncle or great grabdparent. Genes are funny things. "

First off: Never! ever! Start with ""the other studentes/colleagues are complaining that..."". This will open you up for questionning on who is complaining, making things more awkward thans they need to be.
Start from you own pov and adres the issue as "" I have been noticing a unpleasant smell..."". 
Then you can respectfully tell them you think they are the cause of it. Asking them if it's body related, bad hygiene,...
Finally you offer them a solution by pointing to bathroom facilities that are available, deoderant,... "
685,"If you got rid of the handguns, would she be OK with the shotguns if you kept absolutely no ammo around?

If not, is there a way to tinker with the firing mechanism to break the functional part of the gun while preserving the look of the piece and sentimental value?"
686,"&gt; you will be in court for at least a year and you will spend $50,000 at a minimum

I don't think so; she doesn't sound in the least bit interested/invested in any kind of relationship with their kids, let alone custody. 

He lost his job because she wouldn't look after them, and during the time they lived apart, she saw them 5 times in 4 months. I highly doubt she'd mount an expensive, protracted fight for them, even to get housing and support; she doesn't want them, and she's willing/able to quickly attach herself to any new man who'd take her in without the annoying complication of kids."
687,"I'm not sure the idea of ""the more money you make, the better husband/wife you are"" is actually something real, so I think this idea might be worth reconsidering.

"
688,The way a partner treats other people is a great example of how they'll treat you when the honeymoon phase is over.
689,Finally some legit advice.
690,"Yeah, most burglars break in when nobody's home. It's easier and safer.

I had a friend whose house got broken into while she wasn't home, and when she posted about it, a guy started lecturing her about how a gun would have prevented it. How? She wasn't there to shoot the burglar. I guess she should have rigged up a Home Alone booby trap or something."
691,"It ia not normal to have to take your spouse on a work trip with you because he ""hates"" when you travel.  Why does he hate it?   Does he never let you do anything alone?  In what other ways is he controlling and possessive?"
692,"Fourthed. As a brown girl, statements like that make me furious. It's time to leave him. You're way better than this. "
693,"Ill be blunt. Yes its possible to be friends with exs when one is actually honest, mature, and truthful in their intention. HE ISN'T. This isn't one of these situations. He is playing you classically. He dropped you like an old sock after two years and now that  he has had an opportunity to be able to have sex with you again without ANY of the commitment, respect, and love he jumped on it. 

He is purposely giving you mixed signals so you keep your hopes up and keep sleeping with him while he also sleeps with other people. He is a douche bag. Don't be that girl. Respect yourself and tell him to fuck off until he can decide if he wants to commit to you or not. 

I mean unless you don't mind just having this 'FFWB' thing to avail. "
694,"Ugh. You're both terrible people. Tell him you can't be friends with him and more and block him. Then tell her that you guys were cheating so she can find someone who isn't a terrible person.
"
695,How do you know that he doesn't have any feelings for you if he doesn't know how you feel? Be honest. You'll never know unless you share how you feel. 
696,"Freaky. But if op wants a quick answer to her question she can tell the guy she'd like to meet his wife and gauge if he backtracks. 

But I don't see why getting involved with him or his wife is something she'd bother with. The guy is a slimeball and I'm certain his wife knows his personality."
697,"Lmao, that's how I'm reading all these comments. Just a bunch of salty, jealous dudes. It's so much more unlikely that she's playing him than they're two kind of sensitive people who have both afraid to be the ones to put themselves out there and risk rejection/ruining the friendship."
698,"God, yeah, I've been thinking of breaking up with him for months but I talked it over with friends and they kept telling me how amazing he was and how I was just being impulsive and I needed to wait. I shouldn't have waited. All that waiting and nothing getting better. I'm thinking and I guess I've actually been checked out of this for a while. I don't feel upset that I've done something that'll end my relationship, I just feel guilty that I did it and didn't break up with my boyfriend first. That isn't who I want to be, and I had enough cues and thoughts that I should have done it. But I just couldn't because my friends and family liked him and he was objectively great.

Thank you. I am going to break up with him when I see him this week."
699,"Hey, at least he'll *love* doing that while taking advtantage of OP. Don't stop him from achieving his dreams. /s"
700,"Tell your sister to pull the stick out of her ass. My God. If this is how uptight she gets about your husband being a fun-loving dad, I can't imagine what she's like as a teacher. It's gotta be miserable for her poor students. "
701,"I agree that they have simply decided they don't like me, and will always find fault with me. But this racism thing really hit a nerve. I have written a lot about marriage, my husband, my exes, etc. and they have never commented before. Though I'm sure they judged me for it. 

That's a good point. All we've been doing the past few weeks is JADE. I think we should stop, but not sure what other actions we should take. "
702,[removed]
703,"I don't think it's that insane given she approached her at the bus stop and has likely been messaging her from these dummy accounts. In a vacuum yes, it's a big leap, but OP has clearly caught her eye as someone trying to ""ruin"" her relationship. Even if she wasn't stalking him on a daily basis, her behavior is still unacceptable. "
704,"&gt; maybe limited (like once a year?) contact would be okay? How damaging is that sort of thing to kids anyway?

I got to see my racist grandparents once every two or three years, and it was IMMENSELY damaging.  My younger brother--darker and more visibly Filipino than I am--is still dealing with some of the shit that they'd say to him casually.

It is not worth it.

It would have been so much better if I'd never met them."
705,"If you think you are happy with a guy that tells you you are fat and stupid (and doesn't mean it, or so you think) ... imagine how happy you can be with a guy that tells you you are beautiful and smart and awesome ... and does mean it.

Dump this guy."
706,This is a terrible situation and you really need to reassess things. You're going to be a divorced mother of 3 by 25 at this rate.
707,"I don't think this is too uncommon. As long as you, your ex and any partners you both have are on the same page (and super clear with your daughter about what is happening) I think it's a great thing.

Anything that strengthens the coparenting process, minimises conflict, and helps communication between the three of you is a huge positive. Just because you aren't together any more doesn't mean you can't be a team.

As to why it's happening now, it may well be that it has taken your ex 12 months to process your breakup to the point where she is comfortable with this kind of relationship."
708,"I would say if this ""family time"" includes your new partner and her son then ok. If your ex's intention is to exclude them then no. That is the boundary I would set. I can't imagine your new partner being ok with it if you essentially start dating your ex wife, and I also think it would be confusing for your daughter."
709,"You don't need his permission to get an abortion, if that's what you want.

You're only 20. You will meet better guys."
710,"I'm a little woman.  If I eat more than +/- 1000 calories a day, I'll steadily gain weight.  Every now and then I can have a day of 1200+ calories, but not too often.  I was overweight for the better part of my childhood / adolescence / early adulthood because I wanted to eat ""like a normal person.""

Well, normal for me isn't normal for them.  I'd love to get a plate at a restaurant and be able to eat the entire thing (and trust  me -- PHYSICALLY I could definitely put it all away.)  I absolutely envy my coworkers who can go grab a nice sandwich and chips for lunch and think nothing of it, while I'm nursing my stupid Greek yogurt so I don't wake up 2 lbs heavier in the morning.

If you and I went out to eat together, I would 100% envy you for all the food you could put away.  But I also wouldn't be a jerk about it and make YOU feel bad about it, because that would be a shitty thing to do.  Your normal is different from my normal.

You do you, and work on not feeling weird about it, because your body knows what it needs.  Your friends need to work on not being (what sounds like) petty about how little they are able to eat."
711,"Honestly, just go to the fire and forget approach - fire off the compliment, and forget and go on with your day.

I have found this to be useful for me as a cashier to build my self-confidence and people skills. Someone has nice shoes? ""Hey, nice shoes!"" Girl has pretty hair? ""You have very pretty hair."" 

Don't expect a conversation to come from it, you'll probably get a ""Thank you!"" out of it, if the person wants to keep talking keep talking, of course, but nine times out of ten the compliment will be the beginning and end of the conversation. 

After a while, it will be easier to give the compliments and then you can work your way up to conversational stuff."
712,My husband commented 2 hours each way for 2 years. It was hell on him personally. We've been married 100 years and it was still hard on our relationship. It's a bad idea for someone so young to sacrifice so much time to travel. 
713,"True. I think I'm vastly underestimating Hannah's ability to see things for what they are.  Either way, it's shitty that he even considered it."
714,"You say the guy is smart so he is smart enough to know what he is doing is a straight up scam and he willingly knew he was preying on someone who was vunerable.

Serves him god damn right. Cut him off for life as hes a toxic piece of shit."
715,"Thats creepy as fuck.  

But if you know someones full name, its really easy for me to find out a couple of people you are related to, and then find their addresses.  Like, 2 websites and 5 minutes easy."
716,"Uh, is that unreasonable? It's just being polite.

""Hey, do you wanna grab pizza for dinner?""

""*Sorry*, I already had pizza for lunch.""

"
717,It sounds like you won more than 2 tickets.  Did you try asking if he and his friend wanted to go to the special advanced showing you won on Tuesday instead? 
718,"Classic, he's making YOU feel defective so your self esteem gets to the point where you won't leave him. He sounds like a bully and a loser tbh. Can't drive because of his own anxiety but then turns around and bullies you for yours (which is managed and controlled)? Come on. Drop this guy. You can do much better. Don't let him destroy your self worth."
719,"I see, you're a team so long as you deem it a team, but the second she makes a mistake she's on her own? Got it, does your wife know this?"
720,"Yeah, so Chris sees John doing well, feels jealous, and thinks of what he's doing as getting dibs on her.  Yeah I'd tell John, wondering why Mary wouldn't have done that herself anyhow by now.  

Guys that won't wingman for their wingman are not good guys."
721,"You need to pull the plug on Zee.  No wonder your breakup seemed so amicable from your perspective - he doesn't really consider you guys broken up!  Now that it's getting real to him, here comes the belated drama.  The best thing about a breakup and the #1 reason people go through with one is that when it's over, you no longer have to change your life or consider your actions in a way that accommodates the person you've dumped.  Stop having long chats with See, stop with the intimate one-on-one dinners, the car rides, all that stuff.  Start creating some distance between you two, because he's panicking and trying to claw you back.  You aren't dating anymore.  If he is sad about that, you can't make it your problem."
722,"&gt; it still feels like a huge slap in the face

If anything you are underreacting. I would be questioning whether it is worth staying in the relationship at this point. For you almost 2 year BF to say he doesn't want you around when you've been supporting him all this time is heinous."
723,"He can be a little callous sometimes, but in general he's a very loving partner. 

Another weird thing that happened though is when he practiced the ""Acknowledgments"" section of his defense talk for me, he said he would refer to me as one of his ""housemates"" (not ""girlfriend"") because it was easier. At the time I just brushed it off but now it feels weird."
724,"You should have them recovered with an IT professional. Bring your daughter and have her there at the appointment, and make her work to pay off the bill. Sorry or not, it's time for her to learn that actions have consequences."
725,"If your spouse holds those views, and then was faced with the reality of the situation and no longer wanted to report, the cognitive dissonance could cause a lot of anxiety and distress. Not saying it's relevant here, just a note."
726,"They could be iMessages, which don't show up on billing statements or anything like that."
727,"This would affect a lot of relationships. The strippers and the kiss are an issue for many. 

Edit: changed kids to kiss "
728,"i agree, it's *possible* he's some terrible human that's doing this in part of a big scheme to abuse op but there are also a million other possibilities. maybe he has an undiagnosed or underlying/developing mental illness where he doesn't even realize he's moving things (or maybe he does realize it and he's just ashamed/confused/scared). maybe he has a physical illness like a brain tumor and he's misremembering things. maybe *op* has an illness. maybe he has a really weird, shitty sense of humor and this is all some long joke. maybe he's just a normal person who's extremely forgetful - my mom is the exact same way when she doesn't take her adhd medicine. it's just so weird that people automatically jump to abuse and don't offer any other perspectives when it comes to something as niche as this."
729,If someone had called me a dumb piece of shit or a retard i'd show them where the door is.
730,"Did you have PPD or PPA? Because that makes it pretty fucking hard. Not that it can't be hard without those things, but it's amazing how hard being at home with one kid can be when you're depressed."
731,"They have been dating for *months*.  I don't think he should have to run this by her at all.  It's *his* hair.

If she wanted to change her look, I guess she should have to run it by him first also.  

I think the red flag here is that she is 10 years older, and he describes her as 'overbearing'.  "
732,"Give her time. Michael was twenty. Plus she carried him and gave birth to him. It's a huge loss to everyone, but especially her and she saw both events. The loss of a parent is almost expected, the loss of a child never is.

My best advice is to not fuss over her. Do not ask her ""how are you?"" ""are you ok?"" all the time. Of course she isn't ok, and getting her to talk about her feelings or this before she is ready is no good. Try to help her find some normality in her life. Try to help her without making a fuss, turn up with food or help around her house. Whatever you can, but don't make a big deal out of it."
733,"Let this go. Nobody gains anything from letting this into the light, assuming you are correct."
734,"It's really not a big deal. If you do some research on it, you'll figure that out pretty quickly. It's incredibly common and doesn't impact your overall health or lifespan. Plus, if she is on medication and you use condoms, the risk of transmission is only 1%. For perspective: I take meds but my boyfriend and I certainly do NOT use condoms every time, and after 1.5 years, he still hasn't contracted it. This definitely does not need to end your relationship if you really think you love her! Plus, other forms of sex like oral and hand jobs are still very safe, so it's possible to be sexual in those ways while you're figuring out if you want to continue things with her."
735,"As someone who has been on this girl's end of things, I read it differently.

&gt; The ""i'm not really sure what's is going on"" sounds like the words from someone who might have played along with whatever happens and now regrets it.  

I see this as ""I need to bring up the ridiculously inappropriate thing you did/said today, but I need to do it in a nice way"" because it is embarrassing as fuck for everyone involved.

&gt; Similarly , the ""I have a boyfriend who I love and I'm sure you love your wife"" part somehow makes me think she was complacent in whatever happened.

I think you mean complicit. 

I read this as a nice way of telling your boss it's not going to happen, I'm not rejecting you because of *you* it's because I have a boyfriend please don't fire me or make my life hard. She's trying to let him off easy.

Why would she speak in code or be subtle about it if they were involved? She didn't know the wife would read this email. Why not just say, it's over, let's be friends, we're a great team at work."
736,"Aw this is sad. She just sounds really lonely. Does she have any activities to do? Can you arrange for her to do some outings? My grandma always likes to play bridge before she passed away. 

Also, you're only paying $350 a month, seriously just deal with it. "
737,"I agree with the straightforward approach of just telling tjem, but... If you don't want to go into details, you could also make it out to be an issue like: ""we're looking forward to meet some of your other friends at the wedding - when you do the seating chart and if it's not too much trouble it'd be great if we weren't seated with X because we'd end up talking about business matters all evening and it would be a shame if we wasted an opportunity to get to know other important people in your life"".

It's understandable that you're frustrated with the pace, but I think you should talk to your mom as well as your doctor and physical therapist before you just drop out. It may seem to you like nothing has changed, but it's probable that your treatment team is seeing results you can't. "

Maybe you would find a better partner at your local LDS church?"
744,"If you are wanting to go by what is technically ""right and wrong"", then the choice would be just to forget about it and go on with life. However if someone intentionally tried to cause problems between my spouse and I, there wouldn't be very much I would leave on the table. You don't mess with people's relationships. Perhaps a compromise between the two conflicting actions could be to simply send it to him only, anonymously. Not posting it for others to see but for him only. Then he would know someone out there knows and he has no idea who but it would drive him crazy. "
745,"I mean to be objective, you're fetishizing these men. There's just no way around it. Not healthy to put an arbitrary cap on eligible bachelor's or be cool with a 56 year old cheating on his girlfriend. Either adjust your goal posts or get used to this. "
746,"Complimenting what she's *done* (ie, her choice of dress, the way she's done her hair or makeup) is often a safer bet than complimenting how she looks. That way, you're saying, ""I recognise the effort you put into making yourself look beautiful, and you did look very beautiful"", not ""I approve your attractiveness."""
747,Ugh i can't stand people like you and this friend. Tell your girlfriend so SHE can figure out if she wants to keep shitty people in her life.
748,Pathological altruism is a thing. Look it up OP.

751,"The 'resented' dog is the boyfriend's own dog, not OP's dog."
752,"I won't even consider contacting her, but I'm under the impression that she wanted me to plead for her to take me back (as I've done before, and within the realm of possibility that this is what she expected), but I didn't give her that reaction this time around - an ""I want what I can't have,"" scenario. You're right, I don't think she takes my silence over several months as an indication I want nothing to do with her.

She had the gall to cuss me out and berate me over text, then ask me ""Hey, what's up, just checking in to see how you're doing?"" not a full week later."
753,"&gt; He can find himself a polyamorous girl

No polyamorous woman would date him:

&gt; I told him I would agree if I can also see other guys but he shot that idea down saying that it would be just him having one night stands.
"
754,This is really good. People show love in lots of different ways and it sounds like words of affirmation are most important to her. Having a conversation about your love languages could be helpful too. Good luck OP! 
755,"24M here, sorry to read this bro...You sound like you could be successful without her. Maybe the next one will treat you better. All the best "
756,"&gt;they only want to hang out with me when they are not drinking.

Did something happen when you guys were drinking together in the past?  Do they have a reason to not want to be around you when you drink?"
757,Nobody is saying it's easy. Only that it's better than the alternative.
758,"That's what jumped out at me too. Ffs, he was in his early twenties last time he was with another woman! Guys in their 20s have easier and faster erections (not that women appreciate the speed lol), plus TEN YEARS is a long time for things to change. 

Like, what if you two struggled with infertility, he got tested and found it wasn't him, but you were like, ""well I got pregnant with other dudes before/had a kid in my first marriage, so it must be you!"" That would be nuts. 

Also, it just speaks poorly of him at all that he is putting it on you. He doesn't want to feel unmanly, which you can sympathize with, but he is making you feel bad and resenting you instead of facing his problems, which isn't excuseable. You deserve a big apology."
759,"&gt; I broke my sister and now she doesn't know how to behave correctly.

How? Are you leaving some huge part of this story out?

Because, from what you've explained, your sister was born a narcissistic, entitled lunatic, and has been enabled every step of the way by your parents. I don't understand how you would have had any part in that. "
760,"I wouldn't recommend the concept of swapping. I tried to do this with someone I moved in with, and at the end of the 6 months she refused to switch because she had purchased a larger bed and a bunch of stuff that ""wouldn't fit"" in the smaller bedroom. It was fucked up. OP doesn't know this guy well enough to know if he would hold true to his word of switching halfway through "
761,Huge or deflated breasts can also happen. Sometimes you can't win...
762,"I don't think they're arguing that male-female platonic friends don't exist, but rather that these quickly developed and deep 1-on-1 friendships seem pretty rare between men and women who aren't romantically attracted to each other. I have many platonic male friends, but I don't spend hours and hours every week alone with them, deep into the night. 

I think this situation raises eyebrows because this is a new female friend who's been sort of ""fast-tracked"" into the type of friendship that would be more acceptable for a friend of many many years. It might be they just click perfectly on a platonic level, or it might be a romantic spark."
763,"lady, don't be dense. He's 33 and he just doesn't want to work. Are you ok with that? Living the rest of your life with some dude who can't be fucked to get a job and further himself?"
764,"I have mostly blank walls because I don't know how to hang anything. I also don't have any family photos because that's just not a thing my family did (displaying them I mean, we had albums). Is it clean? Cluttered? Do you have any friends you could ask?"
765,"Keeping you from leaving is actually abuse on her part, and  berating you is verbal abuse. I would just be done with this. "
766,"You're allowed to move on from a job!!! If you very nicely phrase that your doctor suggests you find less physically taxing work, or whatever, she'd have to be a real arsehole to give you a negative review."
767,"I do see where you're coming from. As someone who was in a relationship with rampant gaslighting, I'd like to offer a different perspective. 

Whether intentional or accidental, gaslighting is one of the most insidious manipulations out there. It causes the victim to second guess their every decision and action and you start to feel legitimately crazy. Especially when it's someone you live with and trust, it means there's 2 options. Either they're lying to you or you're somehow ill and can't remember what you're doing/saying. I myself was on the edge of buying a recorder because I'd have conversations with my ex and he'd say XYZ, but two days later, he'd swear he said ABC and I must be imagining it. 

Gaslighting fucks you up, period. Although I do understand why you, in a loving long term relationship, see the nanny cam as a violation, clearly something is wrong in OP's relationship and the cam could provide OP either the peace of mind of knowing she hasn't been moving her own stuff or the knowledge she should seek help for her memory issues. "
768,"I've never felt the need to verbalize that my partner is fucking retarded, nor have I ever thought that, but that's just me. Obviously OP's S/O is different.

I wonder how you'd feel if you found a journal your partner kept where they called you things like ""ugly piece of shit"", ""lifelong failure"", etc... Would you be totally okay with those?"
769,[deleted]
770,"The fiancee dances burlesque as a semi-pro, so that's a pretty major part of her life, not like a stamp collection she works on once a month. As for the reproductive plans. . . it might be kind of awkward if OP and his wife showed up with an adopted kid and the parents had *zero* idea they were even doing it. Wouldn't you be upset if your adult children spent two or three years working on an adoption and simply introduced you to the child with no comment?"
771,"I think calling him a heartless piece of shit was too good for him. First of all, my condolences on the passing of your cousin. Secondly, this guy is a grade A, narcissistic douchebag. You did yourself a favor by cutting him out of your life. Take the time now to grieve and heal from your cousin's death. Don't waste two more seconds of good brain waves thinking about that jerk. ((HUGS))"
772,"Yeah, I'm going to be straight with you. I don't get off from sex alone. I've done that exactly once before in my life. That doesn't mean I don't enjoy sex. Secondly, us girls talk about these things, please don't hold that against her. She wasn't trash talking you so that's a good thing. Maybe you could try to look into some new techniques, or see if she would be OK with using toys. 
   On another note sexual satisfaction is important in a marriage IMO. So this is something that should be sorted out. I don't think you should end an otherwise good relationship without at least attempting to fix the problem first. Good luck."
773,"Would you believe that people want to have excellent sexual chemistry with their potential life partners, rather than just being loved more than their exes? 

Don't get me wrong, the latter is extremely important, its just not an either/or scenario.  A lifetime partnership is challenging enough without being hung up on the fact that your ex gave you multiple orgasms while you fake it with the person who you've agreed to probably be monogamous with for the rest of your life. 

I mean there's a chance things are fixable.  ""My ex loved giving me oral and you never do, but I didn't want to point out out"".  Great!  Easily addressable.  But the fact that she's never mentioned it makes me think it's unlikely to be something so easy to communicate and fix. 

But surely you recognize that that's not the only possible choice, taught?  Physical compatability and attraction is a thing, and while one can certainly do a good amount of self-improvement, its naive to expect someone to find everybody equally attractive. "

785,Getting excited about a possible relationship makes you a bad person? Where is there any evidence of any sinister intent here? You're making a massive leap here.
786,"Yea. OP wants to ""get her to see his side"" (in the post title). But it sounds like he is dismissing her valid side.  Maybe she is clingy, but it also sounds like he isn't acknowledging her side.  
Maybe they just aren't compatible."
787,"He's 20 and has had many girlfriends, including someone who was 10 years older? And now he's dating someone who's still in high school?

I'm ... you know what, you're his mother so you know him better. But just from an outside perspective, he doesn't seem as well-adjusted as you claim."
788,I think you just sit down at talk to her about the lack of intimacy and lack of joy in your relationship without getting into any trans issues. 
789,"The people who beat your grandfather are dead.  The person requesting the items back are not responsible for the past.  Especially in this case, where atrocities were committed by all sides in the war, holding a ""Well, YOU PEOPLE screwed up my grandfather so FUCK YOU"" attitude is not terribly healthy.

Your uncle *broke your nose* for even discussing the topic with him.  He tackled you over a table and put you in the hospital over a journal that wasn't even written by someone in your family - it was the personal memoirs of someone that none of you knew, that was stolen as a trophy (yes, under mitigating circumstances).    

Personally, I'd rather have a relationship with the nice Japanese family who offered to buy their family heirlooms and personal items back from you than your violent, hateful uncle who threatened to disown you over spoils of war."
790,Don't text her. Call her. 
791,Sorry I was unclear-- I meant show it to the little sister. 
792,"That's easy, don't fuck him. He can get over it or piss off, but he's not the one who will have to deal with the pregnancy."
793,"It just sounds like you were the right girl for him, but at the wrong time.  At some level he realized that, and the things he said in combination with him not wanting to fully let go, but not being ready to fully commit, indicates he knew it too."
794,I'm a sucker for happy updates. Good job on you and your husband's part. I'm very happy to see it is going so well. Kid is blessed with 2 awesome daddies and 2 awesome families. 
795,"excuses, excuses. I see you as exhibiting parasitic behavior and there is no sympathy coming to you from this direction.

Get your act together, pay your GF back what you owe her and maybe she won't have to prostitute herself. 

But be honest did you ever have any intention of paying her back?"
796,[removed]
797,"They don't have sexual compatibility issues. He has tried repeatedly to rape her. 

""try to put it in my ass without my consent"" "
798,"Drop by /r/daddit or /r/predaddit for some advice from people who've gone or going through it.

But, I'd say it doesn't sound like you two are working as a team. And to get through the craziness that is a baby, and at least the first year... you HAVE to come together as a single unit, a team...

How you two get to that stage again, I'll leave that for smarter men to suggest."
799,"The child hasn't done anything to hurt me. The problem is the nature of the events that caused the child to exist at all, and the memories of those feelings being associated with the child. If we had seperated for years, and decided to try again later and she had other kids with another guy, that would be different. I've always planned on adopting children after having a few of my own, but in those cases the children wouldn't come with grudges and cold feelings. There's so much bitterness about the situation that I'm worried I won't be able to seperate the idea of the child from the negative emotions. I don't want to feel that way about anyone, much less a child in my home that I'm supposed to be caring for. "
800,You should put that in the OP. He was cheating on you and degrading you to other women. What a terrible guy. I hope you find someone who treasures you. 
801,And saying she could see her boss as a sister in law...OP needs to calm down! 
802,"Sex addiction is a real thing, and it is a compulsive ""acting out"" whether or not the person is in a healthy sexual relationship or not. 

The question you need to ask yourself is whether you are ok with being with someone who has this disease. 

Relapse is a reality - and just like with alcoholism, drug addiction, food, gaming, etc., it *does* happen. That doesn't mean it's going to happen, or that it *has* to, but it does happen. 

His description of his addiction is real, and help is necessary. 

I'd suggest if you are open to continuing this relationship, you do some research on sex addiction yourself - not only to be supportive, but to also be knowledgeable about what he is doing/going through. 

"
803,"&gt; She was being crass to bring such a topic up for conversation and you allowed jealousy to rattle you when you need to stay firm.

People have pasts, the older you get tho more of a past there is to deal with. There was nothing crass about what she said. Maybe if she sat down next to him and randomly said I once had terrible sex with a dude with a giant dick little crass. Here they were having a joke about a prior relationship, he asked a question and got an answer he didn't like. Nothing crass about it. Some needless jealousy on his part

"
804,"So much this. I have a close male friend and I've been dealing with some rough things lately. What sets him apart from some of my other friends is he won't just say canned things like ""You'll be ok"" or similar. He says something that relates specifically *to me*. Like the other night he said ""You're more focused than me. You're still you. You can still think and you have your moral compass and you can reason out a plan. It will be hard, but I know all that is true about you, and you've got this.""

That says more than ""Oh no this person is upset I should say something supportive"". That says ""I understand you on a personal level. I know who you are inside, I understand how you are feeling and here are the tools I know you have to get through this. I'm not just saying something nice, I believe in YOU."" 

That's what's great about love, whether it's the love of a friend, a family member, an SO, or anything else. It gets shown in ways like that, all the time. It doesn't always have to be a grand gesture."
805,"TIL working 55hour weeks is lazy.

Well crap. 

I get the sentiment, maybe that was a poor choice of words :3"
806,"I was coming here to say this as well.  

You're fine how you are, unless you have something wrong with your endocrine system that needs fixing.  Some of the ""downstream"" effects of having off hormones are osteoporosis and diabetes.  So, really, the last thing you want to do is avoid the doctor and eat a ton of food to gain weight. "
807,"I'm going to echo what others are saying. Just go ahead and move out. Tell your husband that you are tired of being the mom, that you are basically near your breaking point and you need some time. 

Can you work remotely from anywhere? Do you have family that you can go to? A month away from the madness and a month for your husband to realize what life is like without you would be great. "
808,"&gt; I think I need to accept that she isn't going to change.

She's not and it's good that you realize this. Don't be afraid to break up with her just because it's your first relationship. "
809,"Girls are just as sleazy. But I'm talking TO a girl about young men right now. If a boy were asking for advice, I would have said the same thing regarding girls. Chill. 
Side note, a girl just said someone released revenge porn and instead of helping, you're upset at the phrasing of my response. "
810,"I think we can forgive her for using figurative language.  English isn't even her native tongue, but you and I both managed to figure out that they weren't literally forcing her.   Besides, she can't change the title now anyway unless she creates a whole new post.   "
811,"It's to prove my earnings, but my savings are in my current account so the bank statement would show both. I don't actually have a job so no pay slips but I recieve an educational grant every month from the NHS because of the college course I do. They don't send me a monthly record of it, but I do get an email every year basically breaking down how much I will recieve. If she brings it up, I'm going to ask her if that will be enough. "
812,"It's the ""in a few weeks...we are gonna discuss dating again"" part that would be worrisome for me. I get it, the end of semester is busy right now, I really do. Nobody's saying she has to prove herself to you the very night she gets hammered on her 21st. What would concern me is that she wants to ""discuss"" it with you in a few weeks, not necessarily date you in a few weeks. 


It takes almost no time or effort to say, ""hey, TheAlmightyNivs, I really like you and I want to go out with you on some dates. I can't really do anything big or romantic now because things are so hectic with my schedule, but I would like to spend some time with you when some opens up.""  

I'm rooting for you, man, I really am, but I guarantee her schedule's not *that* busy to where she can't let you know what's going on in her head the day or two after the party."
813,"Yea - communication is great, but as an almost 30-year old person, some things should not NEED to be communicated.

&gt; made positive remarks about exes and insulted (including immature and over-the-line name-calling) my family

This... you should NOT need to first have the ""hey please don't baselessly insult my family"" talk.  Jeez."
814,I'd probably avoid telling him. If he knows that you're aware of it he might work out that you're only keeping in contact with him for the school funding and he may stop paying out of spite. Don't mention it and only see or speak to him when absolutely necessary. 
815,"It doesn't sound like you need to tell her much at all, nor would ""telling her"" do you any good.  Because this:  

&gt; she can’t handle being confronted or criticized, so for the most part, I’ve just shut up and taken it. Once in a while I will defend myself, but with great caution because she will either become a dysfunctional wreck or get hostile and start screaming at me.

Telling her ANYTHING seems unproductive.  

So I'd go see a lawyer and discuss how you'll dissolve the ""legal contract"" part of the marriage.  Figure out how you're going to get either her stuff or your stuff out of the shared home, and what gets done about your shared home.  

Then don't give her any options to talk you out of it.  This divorce is happening.  If she flies off the handle, and she will, you're just going to walk right out. "
816,"Thank you, this is more accurate than you know. They were the first in their family not to have an arranged marriage, but it was still within the same religion. Branching out takes time, and I can't reasonably expect them to change their minds overnight."
817,"This. She has the high-paying job BECAUSE of her education, even if she didn't get her degree in that area. We had somewhat of the same situation in my husband's family where he was the first to go to college and got an MS, but then the bottom fell out of the market in which he got his MS and he ended up having to reorient himself. He ended up as a highly paid consultant in a tech field, but his family long considered him to be a failure because he didn't get a field in his MS. They didn't understand that he never would have gotten his current job without his degree because of the skills he learned at college."
818,"1) You do not name babies after previous partners, no matter the circumstances. It is deeply disrespectful to the current partner and actual parent of the child.

2) You do not name babies after horrible people. Her abuse should be enough to not even make him consider this. How does he imagine telling his child about her name? ""I named you for my abusive ex-wife who tried to kill me."" What a horrible thing to do to a child. And your daughter would 100% try and change her name as soon as she gets the chance. 

3) You do not give babies a name that has horrible karma. Superstitions are stupid and stuff, but still. It feels wrong, it feels like waiting for another tragedy to happen.

There are three people who are intimately connected to this name: You, your husband and your unborn daughter. His ex-wife is not among them. You have no reason to like the name and a thousand reasons to absolutely despise the name and the person. Your daughter has no reason to like the name and a thousand reasons to absolutely despise the name and the person. Your husband needs help. This person is not someone who's memory should be honored. 

Focus on your daughter when you talk to him. She WILL change her name if she legally can. She will probably go by her middle name as soon as she can. So what exactly is the point?

Edit: After having read u/Kiwikid14's comment I want to add: There is a good chance that calling your daughter by that name will seriously impact your ability to bond with her as well, OP! We give our children names we love because we love our kids and want to call them something beautiful, something that is a joy to utter and hear and read for the rest of our lives. "
819,"What is wrong with people in this thread? It is not okay to guilt, whine, beg, complain, coerce, and straight up force yourself on your SO to get sex. All this stuff is manipulation and worse, because she doesn't respect and like your answer, which you have every right to give. I still can't believe this! You say ""No thanks"" to sex, and your SO takes her clothes off and pushes herself on you anyway? Your SO is WAY over the line. It is okay for you to say no, for any reason! "
820,"&gt;Additionally, before my boyfriend told her to stop, she was telling everyone at their work about our private sex life!

Umm...how does she know about your private sex life??"
821,"Then you'll have to live with the fact that she's overweight and won't do anything about it. Also, that its your fault, apparently.

Edit: I mean, it's one thing being happy with who you are, but if she's blaming you for not even *wanting* to lose weight, then there isn't a whole lot of reasoning with her, because that's not a reasonable position."
822,You ACT like a baby.  If I was her I would divorce you.
823,Great advice /u/Stooby2!
824,"Lol I'm sure my gf would prefer me to be an athletic hunk, yet I'm not feeling pressured.
Sounds like GF asked a question she didn't want an honest answer to, and is too insecure to handle it.  Sounds like the communication problem is hers, and OP isn't  a mind reader."
825,Get ready for the we need a break speech.She is pulling away from you and doesn't want to be the one to break up.Ask her straight out does she want to break up and if there is any hesitation or doubt in her answer you will know where you stand.
826,[removed]
827,"Condoms.  You wear condoms every god damn time.  

Also, she can work with her doctor to find the best birth control option.  Not all birth control makes every woman gain weight.  If she starts having undesirable side effects encourage her to talk openly with her doctor.  "
828,"But he can't make rent? Or pay for your brother's tuition? NOPE.

I'm willing to bet that your dads debt load is massive, and he is just keeping up the appearance of having money. He's convinced everyone, including his own kids that he has money that he probably doesn't have. If he has the money, he's truly a despicable person who essential stole money he didn't need form his own child. I think it's much more likely that he stole money that he urgently needed very badly from his child.  

Have you got any text messages or e-mails in which he says he'll pay you back, and that this wasn't a gift? Ideally something that also outlines his claims about the penalty free withdrawal? Do you want to maintain a relationship with this common criminal? Or just get your money and move on? 

Stop mixing your finances with your family. It rarely turns out well. Even if it sounds good, it almost never is. Before you borrow(/lend) money from(/to) a friend or family member, decide which one you need more. "
829,"I'm so sorry OP.

Do the following:

- Call the National Domestic Violence hotline.  It's free and anonymous and 24/7.  Ask for their advice and possible local support.  They will have specific advice on what to do for a spouse who is threatening to kill the victim.  She has to be very careful.

- Call the police's non-emergency line and ask for their advice.  (The police in your mom's hometown). Give a fake name. 

- Find a therapist for you, possibly a PTSD one to have a safe space to vent and heal.  Your mom may choose to remain with him, and that can be hard to process. 


Stay safe OP"
830,"Girl I've been there with the denial and being with a shitty asshole like this guy, age difference even bigger. It's not worth it. You're still so young and have so much life ahead of you. Look to the future. You know deep down this guy is a jerk off, but you think he can change. Don't stay with someone hoping they'll change. Break up and find someone that you can be with as is."
831,"Dude, she broke up with you more than a month ago, she has NO right to be paying attention to who you're screwing, much less who you're just friends with on facebook. This is WAY out of line. Cut contact, and if you have any mutual friends, ask them to help you get some space. Also, please set aside any thoughts you may have had about getting back together. This person has no sense of boundaries or common decency. She is manipulative, cagey, and sticking her nose in business that is not hers in any way, shape, or form."
